it 's a chilling figure : 191,369 men , women and children reported killed in @entity4 between march 2011 and the end of april 2014			1
the figure , the result of a new analysis for the @entity8 , is a significant increase on the last update provided by the @entity8 , but even so it is probably less than the true number of those killed			1
it prompted @entity17 @entity16 to slam the inaction by the @entity19 that has allowed the slaughter to continue unabated			0
" the killers , destroyers and torturers in @entity4 have been empowered and emboldened by the international paralysis , " she said in a statement friday			1
" there are serious allegations that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed time and time again with total impunity , yet the @entity19 has failed to refer the case of @entity4 to the @entity35 , where it clearly belongs			2
" @entity16 pointed out that the total number of killings is more than double the number documented a year ago			1
but , she said , " tragically it is probably an underestimate of the real total number of people killed during the first three years of this murderous conflict			1
" she added , " i deeply regret that , given the onset of so many other armed conflicts in this period of global destabilization , the fighting in @entity4 and its dreadful impact on millions of civilians has dropped off the international radar			0
" the new @entity8 figure is based on analysis of 318,910 reported killings , in which the name of the victim , as well as the date and location of the death , had to be documented			0
five different sources of data were used to confirm details and exclude repetitions			0
the largest number of documented killings was in the @entity67 countryside , with nearly 40,000 , with the next highest numbers recorded in @entity69 , with nearly 32,000 , and @entity70 with just over 28,000			0
about 85 % of those killed were male and 9.3 % were female			1
the analysis was not able to distinguish between combatants and noncombatants , the @entity8 said			0
at least 8,803 children are documented as having been killed , including more than a quarter who were under 10 years old			0
however , the real total is likely to be higher , the statement said , because the victims ' ages have not been recorded in more than 80 % of cases			2
@entity16 called for governments to take " serious measures to halt the fighting and deter the crimes , and above all stop fueling this monumental , and wholly avoidable , human catastrophe through the provision of arms and other military supplies			0
" @entity91 , a longstanding ally of @entity4 president @entity92 , has repeatedly blocked @entity8 sanction resolutions on @entity4			2
both the @entity4 government and the rebels they are fighting have been accused of serious human rights abuses .			1

new @entity8 study *concludes* at least 191,369 people have died in @entity4 conflict
@entity8 human rights chief @entity16 *condemns* " international paralysis " over @entity4
the figure is probably an underestimate of the real total number of people killed , she says
analysts could not determine if dead were fighters or not ; 85 % of deaths were of males
