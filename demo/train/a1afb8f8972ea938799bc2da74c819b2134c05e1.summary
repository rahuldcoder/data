@entity0 -- the @entity2 on friday said it was studying a federal judge 's order that it consider withdrawing two popular antibiotics from use in livestock			1
in a ruling issued thursday , @entity9 magistrate judge @entity8 said that the @entity2 must issue notices to drug manufacturers that the drugs will be withdrawn unless the companies can prove they 're safe			1
@entity8 did n't issue a full ban -- suggesting the manufacturers should be given a hearing to make their case			0
the suit was originally brought by the @entity20 , which argued that the @entity2 has allowed livestock producers to use popular antibiotics penicillin and tetracycline in feed for more than 30 years for purposes other than treatment of illnesses			1
the @entity20 claims " the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in animal feed can lead to the growth and spread of drug - resistant bacteria capable of infecting people			0
" antibiotic resistant bacteria are fast - moving , can be deadly , and can infect otherwise healthy individuals			0
in its statement , the @entity2 said , " we are studying the opinion and considering appropriate next steps			1
" thursday 's ruling can be traced back to decisions the @entity2 made more than 30 years ago			2
in 1977 , the @entity2 announced plans to withdraw approval of some antibiotics used in livestock feed			1
the drugs have been used by livestock producers to help promote growth and feed efficiency			2
at the time , the @entity2 found the practice of using antibiotics for non-medical reasons unsafe			1
drug manufacturers requested hearings , but the @entity2 never scheduled meetings and nothing else was done			2
the approval remained in place			0
in subsequent years , new medical evidence suggested that treating livestock with antibiotics increased risks to human health			1
but according to the judge 's ruling , the @entity2 never changed its position			2
in may , two petitions circulated urging the @entity2 to finish what it started in 1977			2
when the @entity2 did n't respond , the @entity20 filed suit			0
in december , the @entity2 withdrew the original 1977 notices saying they were outdated			0
the suit alleged that the @entity2 's failure to withdraw approval of penicillin and tetracycline after the 1977 research was unlawful and violated the administrative procedure act			0
according to the @entity20 , 80 % of antibiotics used in the @entity9 is used in livestock			0
the group also says 29.8 million pounds of antibiotics were used in livestock in 2009 , up dramatically from the previous decade			0
meanwhile , the ruling is n't sitting well with beef producers			1
the @entity86 noted its dissent in a statement saying its members were " disappointed with the decision , " and that practices include the " judicious use of antibiotics to prevent , control and treat any cattle health issues			1
" if drug manufacturers fail to show that using the antibiotics in livestock is safe , the @entity2 commissioner must issue a withdrawal order			1
but the judge noted that if the drugs are deemed safe , the @entity2 can not withdraw them from use .			0

the @entity2 says it will study the order
beef producers are disappointed , say use of antibiotics is " judicious "
treating livestock with antibiotics may pose risks to human health
