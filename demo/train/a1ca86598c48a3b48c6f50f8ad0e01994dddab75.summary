-- @entity1 has a vision : an ocean race from @entity4 to the @entity6 city of @entity7 , via the @entity8			1
" because of climate change , we can do this race , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
he pictures oceangoing sailboats hugging the @entity14 coast up through @entity15 to western @entity16 , then heading west through the @entity17 to @entity18 on @entity20 's @entity8 coastline , before rounding @entity21 to @entity22 and , at last , @entity7			1
in 2017 , @entity1 plans to make this a reality in the form of the sailing the @entity25 , or @entity26			1
" the @entity8 is the big attraction			1
there is a romanticism about it , " says the 66 - year - old , who spent decades working in advertising while nursing his passion for sailing			1
" crossing the @entity14 has been done so many times , going around the world this way , that way			1
" crossing the @entity8 by sail ? that 's only been done by a few people , and only six people have done it twice , " he claims			1
" more people have been on the moon			2
" in the age of sail , the @entity8 took hundreds of lives as explorers fought to navigate and conquer a vast , deadly stretch of water littered with sea ice and rocks			1
earlier this week , @entity6 authorities announced the discovery of a wreck from one of the most celebrated early , doomed voyages -- sir @entity61 's 1845 expedition , during which all 129 crew members died			1
sea ice conditions are much more favorable to shipping in the 21st century , and that makes @entity1 confident his race can work			1
" my job is , number one , safety , " he insists			2
" i do n't want anyone to get hurt			2
" the race is n't easy because of the climate , the ice , but we can take care of that			1
our route is designed with the recommendations of people who were captains there all their lives , looking over our shoulder			2
" but it is dangerous			0
it is definitely an extreme sport			0
" extreme sailing is a major industry with the @entity88 , a round - the - world event lasting nine months , one of the sport 's signature contests			1
@entity1 tells @entity0 he has @entity88 participants prepared to take part in the inaugural race through the @entity17 , scheduled to begin in june 2017 and end in late september or early october			1
" we already have more people willing to attend than there are spaces for boats , " he adds			0
" i want to go with 20 to 25 boats and the good thing is we have so many people wanting to go			0
" that means we can pick who is the best - financed and who is the most experienced and , by doing so , we reduce the danger of trouble			0
" @entity109 , director of @entity110 -- a company working with yachts to guide them through remote @entity8 waters -- has reservations about the concept of an @entity8 sailing race			1
" all the races in the @entity118 currently , interestingly , have waypoints which keep them away from the main danger of icebergs , " notes @entity109			0
" this race , clearly , wo n't be able to do that			2
so that 's a different safety philosophy			2
" it 's doable , but it will persuade people to push the limits a bit more			2
one of the things you do n't do when you go up there is push the limits			0
" you have to understand there is not so much help and assistance around			0
i would be surprised if that race happened without someone pushing the limits a bit too far and needing some assistance			2
sooner or later , the @entity6 authorities are going to get upset			0
" @entity145 represents those authorities			0
as assistant commissioner of the @entity147 , he shares @entity109 's concerns			1
@entity145 is currently overseeing an intense and tricky @entity8 shipping season which has forced a number of vessels to abandon planned crossings of the @entity17			1
in his opinion , even planning a race three years from now is ambitious			2
" if we 're talking the @entity17 , the ice conditions we 're seeing -- with multi-year ice coming down from the high @entity8 -- it would be a huge challenge for 2017 , " says @entity145			1
" it 's certainly not something , with the conditions we see today , that is likely to happen			2
and that is the first i 've heard of it			0
" @entity1 dismisses the suggestion his race will not go ahead , claiming the contested ownership of high @entity8 waters is providing the political clout to push the event forward			1
" it will happen , 110 % , " he says			0
" there is no way around it			0
the support is surreal , i 'm astonished			0
there is a lot of political will to make this happen			0
" @entity20 wants to say , ' the @entity17 belongs to us			1
' there is a reason the @entity6 prime minister , @entity185 , was just there			0
he wants to make sure this is part of @entity20			1
" we will do that without the military			0
we will do that with sport			0
" the project is self - financed for now , though @entity1 adds " quite a bit of federal , provincial and local sponsorship " has been secured			0
his ultimate ambition , he says , is for the race to educate the world about the fragility of the @entity8			1
@entity26 's plans call for children at each stopover destination on the race route to engage in up to six months of related schoolwork prior to the race 's visit , culminating in presentations to local political and industry leaders			1
" this is almost the most important part of the race , " says @entity1			2
" the kids can tell those leaders they are messing stuff up now , big time			0
they are drilling , they are fracking , they are breaking stuff			0
those kids do n't want to clean that up			0
" the kids will put propositions on the table for alternatives , under huge scrutiny , presented to the whole world			2
" i do n't think we will save the planet , but we can show people how beautiful this place is -- and just do n't mess it up			0
if you go there , go there gently			0
