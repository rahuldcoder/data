@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 is a place you can raise your cattle and chickens under the hot @entity1 sun , cool off with a bottle from the @entity1 's oldest independent brewery , then go to bed knowing all your neighbors and believing that you 'll be safe			1
but a few days ago , one of its trademark ranches turned into a crime scene			0
that 's when a father spotted a man sexually assaulting his 5 - year - old daughter , then beat the alleged abuser to death			1

once the investigation is completed , we will submit it to the district attorney , who then submits it to the grand jury , who will decide if they will indict him			0

" " he 's not a violent guy			0
he 's never been in any trouble in his life , " @entity29 said of a man he described as a single father who worked nobly to make ends meet			1
" he 's a good , honest , hard - working kid			1

billing itself as the " @entity140 in @entity1 , " @entity0 is known for the @entity141 , a wire and plastics company , not to mention its acres upon acres of plains and farms			1
