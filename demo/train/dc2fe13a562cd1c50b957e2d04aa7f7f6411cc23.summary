-- a new study released thursday suggests mammograms might not be as effective in reducing deaths from breast cancer in women over 50 as previously thought			1
the study , published in the @entity7 , analyzed data from more than 40,000 women with breast cancer			0
it concluded the availability of mammography screening corresponded with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer , " but the screening itself accounted for only about a third of the total reduction			0
" the study involved women in @entity21 between ages 50 and 69			0
researchers from @entity21 and @entity24 compared the death rates from breast cancer in four groups : one group of women from 1996 through 2005 who were living in @entity21 counties with screening ; another group in the same time period who were living in counties without screening ; and two similar groups from 1986 through 1995			1
" among women in the nonscreening group , there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer , as compared with the preceding 10 - year period , presumably as a result of increased breast - cancer awareness , improved therapy , and the use of more sensitive diagnostic tools , " the findings state			1
" among women in the screening group , there was a 28 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer during the same period			2
thus , the relative reduction in mortality that was causally related to the screening program alone was 10 percent			1
" the publication notes that in 2002 , the @entity57 concluded that mammography screening for women between ages 50 and 69 reduced the death rate from breast cancer by 25 percent			2
researchers said challenges in measuring the effectiveness of mammography screenings include increases in breast - cancer awareness and advances in treatment .			0

study : the *difference* in mortality related to a screening program alone was 10 percent
the study says advances in awareness and treatments have likely improved *survival*
study *focuses* on women with breast cancer in @entity21
