tv history will be made sunday night with the premiere of " @entity2 , " the first prime - time program featuring an all - @entity5 leading cast			1
but even before the first episode has aired , the @entity7 show is receiving a slew of criticism			1
@entity12 of " @entity13 '' is the creator and executive producer , and he 's joined by two fellow " @entity13 " alums : @entity16 and @entity17			1
the soapy comedy - drama is about five @entity5 maids who work for wealthy families and dream of a better life			1
the pilot opens with a @entity25 hostess scolding her maid : " i think what you people do is heroic			0
you wash clothes you ca n't afford			0
you polish silver you will never dine with			0
you mop floors for people who do n't bother to learn your name , " finally ending with , " that said , if you do n't stop screwing my husband , i 'm going to have you deported			0
" " @entity2 " is loosely based on a @entity38 telenovela " @entity40 son @entity39 , " and stars @entity41 ( " scrubs " ) , @entity43 ( " @entity47 " ) , @entity44 ( " @entity45 " ) and @entity46 ( " @entity48 " )			1
newcomer @entity49 plays @entity51 ' daughter			0
recently , some in the @entity54 community have expressed their disappointment for the show , calling it a " wasted opportunity " in that it will only perpetuate the ongoing issue in @entity59 that @entity60 can play only stereotypical roles such as maids , gardeners and nannies			1
" it is not wrong to be a maid , or even a @entity5 maid , " wrote @entity68 , author of " the @entity69 , " in an opinion piece , " but there is something very wrong with an @entity74 entertainment industry that continually tells @entity60 that this is all they are or can ever be			1
" @entity17 responded to the backlash on the @entity77 : " i take pride in the fact that these characters are not one dimensional or limited to their job title			1
as the minority becomes the majority and the @entity74 becomes more diverse , it is important that the protagonists on television embody this diversity			0
" " however , " she continued , " television is a business			0
if we do n't support shows that have diverse content , we wo n't see shows with diverse content ! they will simply go away , and the hurdles to make the next show with diversity will be even more challenging			2
" @entity99 , editor in chief of @entity101 for @entity60 , countered : " well , @entity17 , i 've watched the show , and i 'm genuinely sad to say that i disagree			1
it 's not a complex portrait ; it 's an insulting disgrace			0
" " i saw the first [ episode ] and thought it was annoying , " @entity105 said			0
" i just do n't like the flamenco guitar tone every time there 's a @entity5 on the screen			1
it 's very unimaginative and predictable			0
i have no interest in the show at all			0
" the @entity114 is supporting the show , stating members of the coalition watched the pilot and saw nothing wrong			0
they said if @entity7 were depicting @entity60 in negative stereotypical roles , the coaliton would be the first ones to criticize the show			1
" some of the issues that @entity60 go through in this country is characterized by each of these maids , things they are trying to overcome , " said @entity125 , executive director of the coalition , interview with @entity128			2
" if i came from a poor migrant experience , does that mean that story does n't get told ? that 's silly			2
" part of the criticism is the frustration that @entity54 do n't have more characters on television that represent them as nurses , doctors and lawyers			2
@entity125 says that to imagine @entity60 being represented on - screen as successful professionals before telling the immigrant stories of hardship , assimilation and struggle first just wo n't work			1
actress @entity43 said on a phone interview with @entity128 that @entity12 has hired two @entity5 writers , @entity153 and @entity154 , " to make sure that the @entity54 voices were really present and heard			1
" " we have , as @entity5 maids , been portrayed on television and movies , but none of them have been humanized , " she said			2
" none of them are real life stories , choosing to take this role is more interesting to me because i get to tell a story of struggle			0
" for @entity43 , playing the role of @entity168 on the show strikes an emotional chord			1
her character is a widow who left her son back in @entity38 when her husband died and is working as a maid to help bring him to @entity74			0
" not only do i tell this real compelling immigrant story , but i get to tap into my own experience because my parents had to leave me as an infant with my older sister , @entity179 , back in the @entity180 and that took a lot of courage , " @entity43 said			2
@entity43 's mother worked as a clothing factory worker but was a nurse back in the @entity180 , and her father was a taxi driver , although he was a chemist back in his home country			1
" now , i finally have a chance to portray the stories of the older generation , " said @entity43			2
" if we are going to tackle @entity59 , then we need to educate @entity59 first			2
you got ta start there			0
" however , @entity105 says that people form their idea of reality by what they see on television			0
she used the racist comments about the boy from @entity203 who sang the national anthem at the @entity206 finals as an example of people " who do n't know anything about @entity60 ' different cultures			1
" " i would advise those people to take a closer look at the people who attacked this boy ... where did they get the idea that we 're all illegal immigrants ? well , the opening of the pilot episode of ' @entity2 ' has a boss threatening to deport one of the maids			0
is this the only image @entity59 sees of us ? " @entity43 hopes audiences see that the leading ladies on " @entity2 " as more than maids who are not defined by their jobs who happen to be @entity5			1
even though @entity43 has played every role from " the hot girl " to a superhero , she asks audiences , " how is that better ? "			0

for the first time on tv , there *'ll* be a prime - time program featuring all @entity5 leads
@entity7 's new drama has already received a slew of negative criticism
@entity17 and actress @entity43 defend show
some do n't see show as an opportunity for @entity60 in @entity59
