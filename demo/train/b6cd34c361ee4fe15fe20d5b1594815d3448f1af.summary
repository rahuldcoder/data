it 's been a bloody year in @entity2 , where @entity4 militants have seized swaths of territory and remain on the offensive			1
and the latest figures from the @entity10 monitoring project show that civilians , as so often in war , are paying a heavy price			2
at least 17,049 civilians were recorded killed in @entity2 during 2014 , @entity10 said , roughly double the number recorded in 2013 -- which in turn was about double that of the previous year			1
the shocking rise in deaths in 2014 is due in large part to the @entity4 offensive and the military response to it by @entity2 forces and the @entity25 - led international coalition , the group said			1
based in @entity26 and made up of academics and human rights and anti-war activists , @entity10 monitors and compiles media reports of @entity2 civilian casualties resulting from the violence that followed the @entity25 - led 2003 invasion of @entity2			1
since that invasion , " not a single day has passed without @entity2 civilians being killed , " it said			0
" the year 2014 , however , reflects an increase in violence to levels not seen since the worst years of 2006 and 2007			0
" according to the group , the greatest number of deaths in 2014 were in @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity47 provinces , which together account for about 80 % of civilian deaths			1
the highest number of civilian deaths was seen in @entity43 , with more than 4,750 reported			1
more than 3,600 civilians were killed in western @entity47 province , half of them by the @entity2 military in daily airstrikes , primarily in and around @entity55 , the group said			0
meanwhile , in @entity45 and @entity44 provinces , the killings of civilians by @entity4 contributed significantly to the death toll , it said			2
from 2010 to 2012 , there was a relative reduction in civilian casualties , but the level of violence in the country started to climb again in 2013 , @entity10 said			1
that rise followed the withdrawal of @entity25 troops at the end of 2011 and the implementation of increasingly sectarian policies by the then - @entity76 - led government			0
there has been no monthly civilian death toll lower than 900 since july 2013 , the group said , with most being much higher			2
' new brutality on the ground ' the bloodshed peaked in june , when @entity4 launched a major offensive to take @entity2 's second - largest city , @entity85 , and extend its reach far into the country			2
there were 2,534 civilian deaths recorded that month			1
since then , the average has been more than 1,500 civilian deaths a month			1
it 's not always possible to tell who 's to blame for the deaths			0
but according to @entity10 's analysis , 1,748 civilians were reported killed by @entity2 military airstrikes , while 4,325 were killed by @entity4			1
there were also 118 civilians reported killed by @entity25 coalition airstrikes last year			0
" there is a new brutality on the ground and renewed attacks from the air			0
@entity4 and the @entity2 army have caused thousands of civilian deaths this year , while the international coalition has yet again been responsible for civilian killings , for the first time since @entity25 withdrawal three years previously , " @entity10 said			1
" @entity2 civilians are once again being killed by all sides			0
" @entity115 deaths as for those taking part in the fighting , it 's hard to say with certainty how many have died , the group said			0
@entity2 military and insurgent deaths have increased " dramatically " in 2014 in relation to previous years , it said			2
but there 's also been a sharp divergence in the information coming from different sources , such as news agencies , official statistics and media reports -- giving a total ranging from 4,000 to 5,000 at the low end to roughly 30,000 at the other extreme			2
" the truth probably lies somewhere between these two numbers , but neither can be ruled out at present , " @entity10 said			0
taking that variation into account , between 21,000 and 47,000 people were killed in war - related violence in @entity2 during 2014 , it said			0
that makes it the third - deadliest year since the invasion , after 2006 and 2007 .			0

@entity10 says the number of civilian deaths roughly doubled from 2013 to 2014
the project has monitored and compiled reports of civilian deaths since the 2003 invasion
the @entity4 offensive and military response to it contributed to the 2014 spike in civilian deaths
