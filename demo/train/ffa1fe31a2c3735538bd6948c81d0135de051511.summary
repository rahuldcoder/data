the military coup d'etat that ousted @entity2 president @entity1 brought with it some diplomatic complications for other nations -- namely , that they want to avoid calling it a coup			1
a description of this week 's events -- the military placing the president under house arrest and naming a new leader of its choosing -- fit the definition of a coup			1
but labeling it as such could mean an end of @entity19 military aid to @entity2 , and subsequently a deterioration of relations with an important ally in the @entity23 and @entity24			1
for now , @entity26 nations have avoided using the word " coup , " preferring to watch developments unfold , and pointing to the fact that popular sentiment appears on the side of the military			0
defining a " coup d'etat " the most accepted definition of a coup is a sudden overthrow of a government by a group of conspirators			1
the events in @entity2 are troubling because @entity1 's government had been elected democratically			1
but an autocratic style had turned many of those who voted for him against his leadership and created deep divisions in @entity2			2
the massive protests that took place before the coup , and the celebrations afterward , lead some observers to define it as a revolution			2
but there are previous examples of situations where the public turned on a leader and were labeled a coup nonetheless			0
the environment that led to the ouster of former @entity64 president @entity63 in 2009 was similar to what was seen in @entity2			2
" there was a significant amount of conflict within the country			0
there 's a degree -- a high degree -- of polarization			0
there was a worry about the -- some of the policies that the president undertook and so on , " then assistant secretary of state @entity73 said of @entity64			0
the @entity78 was slow to call it a coup , but eventually stated the action against @entity63 was unjustifiable			0
the @entity19 temporarily stopped some aid programs to @entity64			0
still , when it comes to conflicted countries , the @entity19 has more interests tied to @entity2 than @entity64 , keeping the @entity87 administration from calling it what it is -- a coup			1
repercussions of a coup it matters what the government calls the @entity2 military 's seizure of power , because there is money at stake			1
call it a coup and some of the $ 1.5 billion in annual aid that the @entity19 gives @entity2 is put in jeopardy			1
" if this were to be seen as a coup , then it would limit our ability to have the kind of relationship we think we need with the @entity2 armed forces , " @entity105 chairman gen. @entity104 told @entity106			1
@entity2 is a key player in @entity19 foreign policy in the region , and anything to sour that relationship could have unintended consequences			2
so it was no coincidence that president @entity87 's statement on the coup did not actually use the word " coup			2
" he did n't call upon the military to restore power to " the democratically elected civilian government , " but rather to " a democratically elected civilian government			0
" in other words , it need not be deposed president @entity1 's			1
the thinking of the president and administration officials , according to a knowledgeable source , is that while the administration is not explicitly supporting the removal of @entity1 from power -- it expressly did not support the move -- it is seeking to push the @entity2 military in a direction			1
but @entity19 sen. @entity142 , @entity143 , called friday for the suspension of @entity19 aid to @entity2 's military			1
" we can not repeat the same mistakes that we made at other times in our history by supporting the removal of freely elected governments , " the ranking member of the @entity148 told @entity106 affiliate @entity149			0
once the military sets a timetable for elections and a new constitution , " then we should evaluate whether to continue the aid , " he said			0
a democratic coup ? the @entity2 coup presents a unique case in that there was a popular uprising that accompanied it			1
while military coups usually have the goal of concentrating power in the hands of the armed forces , in this case , the generals immediately named a civilian jurist as interim leader			0
it is a role reminiscent of the uprising that ousted former @entity2 president @entity176 in 2011			2
in that instance , the military took over in the interim until democratic elections could be held			0
once again , the military is stating that it does not want to impose a military dictatorship , but instead usher in another democratically elected government			0
law professor @entity184 published a paper in the @entity186 after @entity176 's ouster , arguing that the events of 2011 broke the mold of traditional military coups			2
" although all coups have anti-democratic features insofar as they place the military in power by force or the threat of force , some military coups are distinctly more democracy - promoting than others , " he wrote			0
" in these coups , the military responds to popular opposition against an authoritarian or totalitarian regime , overthrows that regime , and facilitates fair and free elections within a short span of time			0
" the current situation in @entity2 is still playing out , but @entity184 's research explains why many see this week 's coup as the expression of the popular will of the people .			1

the overthrow of @entity2 's @entity1 meets most definitions of a coup
but the events in @entity2 are not *universally* being called a coup
calling it such may lead to a halt of aid to @entity2
