@entity1 warplanes pounded extremist @entity3 fighters in northern @entity4 on saturday in what officials described as an effort to defend minority @entity8 " being indiscriminately attacked , " strikes that came just as president @entity10 warned of an extended air campaign against the terror group			1
the series of airstrikes began with a mix of fighter jets and drones that targeted militants firing on @entity8 near the town of @entity20 , where fighters with the @entity22 , formerly known as the @entity23 , forced tens of thousands into hiding on nearby @entity20			1
the airstrikes were the first in the @entity20 area since @entity10 authorized targeted attacks to protect @entity1 and @entity4 minorities from an @entity23 advance threatening the @entity31 regional capital of @entity32			1
news of the latest round of airstrikes came as @entity10 declined to provide a timetable for @entity1 airstrikes and humanitarian aid drops in @entity4			1
" i do n't think we 're going to solve this problem in weeks , " the president told reporters in televised remarks , while at the same time reiterating a vow that no @entity1 combat troops will join the fight			0
given that @entity4 security forces still need time to ramp up and @entity4 politicians need space to form to form a more inclusive government to whittle @entity3 support for @entity23 , " this is going to be a long - term project , " @entity10 said from the @entity46			1
the airstrikes on saturday began at about 11:20 a.m. et , with the targeting of two @entity23 armored personnel carriers ( @entity57 ) firing on @entity8 , according to a statement released by the @entity59			1
another two rounds of airstrikes were carried out about 20 minutes later after more @entity23 vehicles , primarily @entity57 , moved into the area , the statement said			2
a fourth round of airstrikes was carried out more than three hours later when @entity1 aircraft struck another @entity23 armored vehicle , it said			2
at the same time , health and civil defense officials said @entity1 warplanes targeted @entity23 fighters near the town of @entity74 , where the group has been launching attacks on the outskirts of @entity32			1
the @entity78 declined to comment on the claims by @entity4 health and civil defense officials in @entity81 , who told @entity83 the airstrikes killed at least 16 of the fighters			2
' running out of time ' meanwhile , the @entity87 and @entity88 has said it will join the @entity1 in humanitarian airdrops for hundreds of thousands of @entity4 on the run ahead of a brutal @entity23 advance			1
on saturday , the @entity1 carried out another round of airdrops			0
three cargo aircraft -- supported by @entity1 fighter jets -- dropped 3,804 gallons of fresh drinking water and 16,128 ready - to - eat meals , the military said			2
but a @entity100 official said airstrikes and humanitarian airdrops are n't enough for the estimated 40,000 minority @entity8 , who are trapped on @entity20 and hiding from @entity23 fighters who have said they will kill the group			1
only about 100 to 150 people a day have been able to be airlifted by @entity4 security forces off the mountain , said @entity109 of @entity110			0
" we are running out of time for thousands who can obviously not be reached by these airdrops , " he said , adding that @entity110 is appealing for the international support to open and secure " a humanitarian corridor over land			0
" dozens , including 60 children , according to @entity110 have died on the mountain where the @entity8 are battling extreme temperatures and a lack of food and water			2
@entity1 planes also have twice dropped food and other supplies to thousands of @entity8 , members of a minority group that fled to a northern @entity4 mountain after @entity23 militants overran their town , @entity10 said saturday			1
@entity1 aircraft are poised to strike @entity23 militants who have surrounded the mountain , @entity10 said			1
any such strikes would support @entity31 forces ' efforts to free the @entity8 , he said			0
the airstrikes have ramped up @entity1 's involvement in @entity4 where @entity23 is seizing control of towns and key infrastructure even as it celebrates its own slaughter along the way			1
the @entity1 has hundreds of military personnel in @entity4 , including advisers sent in recent weeks to coordinate with @entity4 and @entity31 military officials in response to the @entity23 rampage			1
the @entity147 and other navy ships also are in the region			0
@entity10 indicated saturday the @entity1 ' interests in targeting @entity23 went well beyond protecting @entity1 personnel and @entity4 minorities			1
" my team has been vigilant ... about foreign fighters and jihadists gathering in @entity156 and now @entity4 , who might potentially launch attacks outside of the region against @entity160 targets and @entity1 targets , " he said			1
" so there 's going to be a counterterrorism element that we are already preparing for and have been working diligently on for a long time now			0
" @entity10 : @entity4 's ethnic groups need to unite asked saturday if @entity10 felt @entity23 had been underestimated , the president said the advance of the @entity3 @entity23 extremists has been " more rapid " than intelligence officials and policymakers , both inside and outside @entity4 , had predicted			1
but he said @entity23 ' advance was made possible in part by the lack of an inclusive and functioning @entity4 government			2
the government forces , " when they ( were ) far away from @entity176 , did not have the incentive or the capacity to hold ground against an aggressive adversary , " @entity10 said			0
to secure their country , @entity4 will need to build an inclusive government , @entity10 said , in an apparent dig at prime minister @entity187 's @entity186 - dominated government			2
@entity4 's @entity3 minority have bitterly complained of being marginalized and cut out of the political process by @entity187 's government			0
the height of that marginalization coincided with months of deadly sectarian fighting throughout the country , and preceded @entity23 ' rout of @entity4 security forces in @entity81 , @entity4 's second - largest city , earlier this year			0
@entity197 , a @entity198 analyst with the conservative @entity199 , cautioned saturday that even if @entity187 's government would have been more inclusive , @entity23 still would have been a problem			0
" no matter how magnanimous @entity187 could have been in an ideal world , it would have meant nothing to @entity23 , many of whose members are n't even @entity4			0
sometimes there 's no magic diplomatic formula , " @entity197 , a @entity78 official under former president @entity206 , told @entity83			0
one unanswered question , according to @entity209 , the @entity1 ambassador to @entity4 from 2010 to 2012 , is what the @entity1 would do if the @entity4 government and moderate elements ca n't muster the political and military capability to take on @entity23 in @entity4 and @entity156			1
map : where is @entity23 ? militants using @entity1 - made weapons even as the airstrikes were under way , there was news that @entity23 militants captured @entity4 's largest hydroelectric dam , just north of @entity81 , @entity4 's second - largest city			1
according to a senior @entity31 official , the militant fighters have been using @entity1 - made weapons seized during fighting from the @entity4 army , including @entity232 tanks			2
there had been conflicting reports about who controlled the dam on the @entity237 , with heavy fighting under way between @entity23 fighters and @entity31 forces , known as @entity241			2
