-- the big draw to this year 's " @entity11 " @entity2 special was the doctor meeting @entity6 , but as usual , there ended up being a lot more to it than that			1
first thing 's first , @entity13 was brilliant casting in one of the best portrayals of @entity6 ever			1
and the story -- which involved dreams within dreams -- was classic " who , " slyly acknowledging the fact that it was also paying tribute to " @entity22 " and " @entity23			2
" ( " there 's a horror film called ' alien ' ? " the doctor asked in shock			0
" that 's really offensive			0
no wonder everyone keeps invading you			0
" ) but the biggest question hanging over all was where things stood between the doctor and @entity36			1
as showrunner @entity37 put it in a recent call with the press , " as ( the last episode ) ended , they parted forever , having lied to each other , and that is where we find them again			0
we do n't just ignore it because it 's @entity2			0
" indeed , at one point , one of the parasitic aliens convinced @entity36 that her dead boyfriend @entity53 had been alive this whole time , and her encounter with the doctor was the dream			1
her final goodbye to a dream version of @entity53 was heartbreaking , but it still remained to be seen if she would ever travel with the doctor			1
it certainly looked as though this was it -- following a terrific @entity2 moment of the doctor flying in @entity6 's sleigh -- when the doctor saved @entity36 from an alien , only to find that she had aged many years			1
@entity36 fans had to have been overjoyed to see that this too was a dream , and @entity36 was ready to continue her journeys with the doctor , all thanks to @entity6 and his signature tangerines			1
fans on @entity75 reacted on christmas night in a mostly positive manner			1
" that episode of @entity11 actually made me cry ! " tweeted one fan while another tweeted " # @entity79 restored my spirit and has me on the edge of my seat for season 9			2
all of time and space in a big blue box			0
" some were less than enthused			2
" alright # doctorwhochristmas , " tweeted one viewer			0
" my thoughts : eh			0
was i the only one hoping this would be the end for @entity36 ? i just want a new companion for 12			2
" and yet another summed it all up with " recipe for # @entity97 : one part # @entity98 , dash of @entity101 2 parts @entity103 & a side of # @entity105			0

@entity13 makes a smashing @entity6 in " @entity11 " special
there was a heartbreaking goodbye involving @entity36
fans on @entity75 reacted mostly in positive way , but some were less than enthused
