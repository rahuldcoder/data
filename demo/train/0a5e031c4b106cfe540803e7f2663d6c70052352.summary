-- for @entity3 's @entity2 , the latest rebellion began last week in the @entity4 , by way of friendly fire			1
" i care more about my country than i do about a 20 - year - old pledge , " sen. @entity7 , @entity8 , told @entity10 station @entity9			1
" if we do it his way , then we 'll continue in debt , and i just have a disagreement with him about that			0
" the next shot came from @entity22 's sen. @entity21 : " i think @entity3 is wrong when it comes to we ca n't cap deductions and buy down debt ...			1
i will violate the pledge , long story short , for the good of the country			2
" more @entity31 salvos followed			1
rep. @entity32 said the hard line on revenue was based on outdated thinking : " a pledge you signed 20 years ago , 18 years ago , is for that @entity37 " -- not an entire congressional career			2
sen. @entity39 , @entity40 , insisted he was " not obligated on the pledge			0
" @entity43 majority leader @entity42 downplayed the pledge 's significance , saying no one in his home state cared all that much about it			1
sen. @entity49 , @entity50 , stuck to a hard line on taxes , but sounded a similar note : '' oh , i signed it , '' he said			0
" ... but we 've got to deal with the crisis we face			0
we 've got to deal with the political reality of the president 's victory			0
'' the man behind the pledge says he 's not so much embattled as bored			1
" i 've seen this movie about 50 times before , " he told @entity0			0
" i get this every time someone burps			0
it always gets reported as all these guys have caved and said they 're for tax increases			0
all it is happens to be a handful of people are having impure thoughts , " he said , turning to his favorite recent description of the trend			0
take last year , when rep. @entity74 , @entity75 , sounded a defiant note			0
" i signed ( the pledge ) in 1998 when i first ran			0
i did n't know i was signing a marriage agreement that would last forever , " he told @entity78			0
" and i think that the majority of members of @entity37 understand that you have to have additional revenue			0
" @entity84 warns of @entity31 becoming dinosaur , cites robotic squirrels and back then , rep. @entity87 , @entity88 , one of the half - dozen republicans who had n't signed the pledge , took direct aim at @entity3 from the @entity43 floor			1
" i believe how the pledge is interpreted and enforced by mr. @entity3 is a roadblock to realistically reforming our tax code , " he said			1
" have we really reached a point where one person 's demand for ideological purity is paralyzing @entity37 to the point that even a discussion of tax reform is viewed as breaking a no - tax pledge ? " in other words : over the years , semiregular flashes of @entity3 defiance have tended to be one of those @entity110 obsessions that grab big headlines to little permanent effect , sort of like open - mike profanity on the campaign trail			1
one or more @entity31 lawmakers will appear to publicly waver on their commitment to the pledge			1
( @entity3 points to @entity7 , @entity21 and @entity32 as repeat offenders			1
) that open questioning is often followed just as predictably by a private call to @entity3 -- who says @entity7 has called to apologize -- and more often than not , some kind of public mea culpa			2
@entity3 , 56 , has never been elected to public office or held a @entity126 post			2
he is n't a deep - pocketed donor or celebrity magnate			1
the millions of dollars @entity129 , the group he heads , spent on the 2012 campaign is a healthy sum , but pocket change in the @entity135 era			0
@entity3 may have had influence over the direction of super pac funding , but he did n't hold the purse strings			1
and yet he 's routinely named one of the most powerful men in @entity110			1
he hosts off - the - record weekly meetings of the conservative movement 's top figures			2
the " @entity149 " he pushed during the @entity151 era was a leading driver of a massive shift in the lobbying landscape to the @entity31 's benefit			1
and the @entity152 he debuted more than two decades ago has achieved an almost mythic status among fans and foes alike			2
@entity3 views that two - line document -- fewer than 70 words in all -- as something like a blood oath , an ironclad , immutable contract between lawmakers and their constituents that they will not back any bill to raise taxes or revenue			1
famously , he keeps original copies of every signed pledge -- each of which has to be co-signed by two witnesses -- in a fireproof vault for protection			0
this congressional session , that safe held the signatures of nearly every @entity31 member of @entity37 , as well as some @entity178			2
opinion : republicans wisely break with @entity3 @entity3 warns lawmakers who , in his view , turn wobbly on taxes that they 're risking their political lives -- including @entity31 icons like @entity186 sen. @entity185 , who lost both @entity3 's backing and his primary race to @entity189 this year			1
@entity189 , of course , went on to lose a near - guaranteed @entity31 @entity192 seat to @entity194 @entity193 by nearly six points , despite @entity197 's solid @entity186 win at the presidential level			1
there are some who say the zeitgeist has shifted in some tangible way during the current @entity37			0
last year , 40 @entity31 joined 60 democrats as co-signers of a letter that expressed a willingness to consider revenue increases as part of a deficit solution			2
and amid the latest @entity31 pushback , the wave of " @entity212 ? " headlines has been mounting			2
norquist himself often speaks with the casual confidence of a @entity110 fixture , secure in the knowledge that his position is far more secure than any elected official 's			1
" we are not auditioning for fearless leader , " he told activists at this year 's @entity221			0
" we do n't need a president to tell us in what direction to go			0
we know what direction to go ... we just need a president to sign this stuff			0
we do n't need someone to think it up or design it			0
" it was the sort of remark liberal critics often point to as evidence @entity3 is a conservative puppet master with near - limitless power			1
one artist recently depicted him as the @entity238 , an unseen but seemingly omnipotent force ( a portrait @entity3 himself jokingly embraced , retweeting a link to the picture with the caption : " my mom wants one			2
" ) @entity21 says he 'd break no - tax ' pledge ' earlier this year , president @entity248 complained to @entity250 magazine that some @entity31 would like to work with him , but " in an atmosphere in which folks like @entity253 and @entity3 are defining what it means to be a true conservative , they are lying low			1
" when @entity3 last year slammed bipartisan efforts to end pricey ethanol subsidies as a backdoor tax hike , former president @entity256 mused that it seemed @entity31 moves had to be " approved in advance by @entity3			1
" " you 're laughing , " @entity256 told the crowd at the @entity264			2
" but he was quoted in the paper the other day saying he gave @entity31 senators permission " to scrap the subsidies			2
" i thought , ' my @entity270 , what has this country come to when one person has to give you permission to do what 's best for the country ? ' it was chilling			0
" of course , some of the toughest barbs aimed at @entity3 do n't come from the opposite end of the political spectrum ; they come from some fellow conservatives and deficit hawks , particularly members of the old guard who served in an era when tax hikes were still a politically acceptable deficit - fighting option			1
his feuds with some of these figures date back decades			0
more than two decades after @entity151 's signoff on a tax increase first drew @entity3 fire , the former president is still not a fan : " who the hell is @entity3 , anyway ? " @entity151 asked @entity299 over the summer			1
last year , former @entity31 sen. @entity300 , whose @entity301 called for a deficit solution that included a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases , slammed @entity3 's influence : " if @entity3 is now the most powerful man in @entity307 , he should run for president			1
" conservative activist and @entity0 contributor considers primary bid and this week , @entity313 riffed on @entity3 's infamous goal of reducing the federal government " down to the size we can drown in the bathtub			1
" " so how do you deal with guys who came to stop government , or @entity3 wandering the earth in his white robe saying you want to drown government in the bathtub , " @entity313 asked @entity319 on tuesday			2
" i hope he slips in there with it			0
" @entity3 â € ” widely viewed as one of the funniest men in @entity110 -- says he 's unfazed by the attacks , and that the portrait of him as some sort of political enforcer is overblown			1
( although his claim that he collects " whackers " -- items used to hit people -- probably does n't do much to help banish the image			0
) " i understand it comes with the territory that people attack me personally			0
uh , it does n't bother me			0
i am very comfortable in my own skin			0
if they want to waste their time personally attacking me , they 're free to do so , " he shrugs .			0

lawmakers are publicly defying the @entity152
but @entity3 , the man behind the pledge , says he 's seen it before
@entity3 is n't deep - pocketed , but he 's routinely listed as one of @entity110 's most powerful
@entity256 mused that it seemed @entity31 moves had to be approved in advance by @entity3
