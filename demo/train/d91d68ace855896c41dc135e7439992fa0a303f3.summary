-- you just crushed a really hard workout			2
you upped the load of your training , or you stepped out of your routine and tried a new activity			1
you feel great -- until you wake up the next morning , barely able to move			2
enter delayed onset muscle soreness , better known as @entity9			1
it 's an acronym that athletes and fitness buffs wear with pride			1
as its name suggests , " @entity9 is muscle soreness that becomes evident six - to - eight hours following activity , peaking around 24 to 48 hours post-training , " says @entity14 , an exercise scientist at the @entity15			1
while the symptoms will often start to diminish at about 72 hours , " the precise time course and extent of @entity9 is highly variable , " @entity14 says			1
@entity9 is most pronounced when you introduce a new training stimulus -- a new activity , increased intensity or volume -- or if you are new to physical activity in general			1
" your body is making adaptations to better prepare your muscles to do that activity again , " says @entity29 , certified @entity30 and yoga teacher			1
that 's why on day 1 at the gym , after doing squats or lunges with 10 - 15 pound weights , you can be brutally sore the next day			0
" but , as you continue on , you can build up from there , and you wo n't be so sore , " she says			0
while all kinds of muscular contraction can cause soreness , eccentric contraction -- where the muscle lengthens as it contracts -- is most often associated with @entity9 , according to @entity14			1
this includes movements such as running downhill , lowering weights or lowering down into a squat or push - up position			0
" there is also some evidence that upper body movement creates more soreness than lower body exercises , " says @entity14			1
muscle discomfort is the most common characteristic of @entity9 , but there are other symptoms			1
according to the @entity62 , these may include reduced range of motion and joint stiffness , local swelling and tenderness , and diminished muscle strength			1
these symptoms appear gradually following exercise ( not to be confused with acute pain that may arise during physical activity )			1
no pain , no gain			0
lactic acid build - up			0
an indicator of muscle growth			2
these are all phrases that we tend to associate with @entity9			1
while you may think you know everything you need to know about the condition that has you waddling like a duck , you may be surprised by what 's actually happening in your body			0
myth # 1 : @entity9 is caused by the build - up of lactic acid			1
the verdict : not true			0
during exercise , your body needs energy , and it breaks down molecules to get that			0
as a result of this metabolic process , your cells naturally become more acidic which makes your muscles feel like they 're burning			0
but this is n't caused by lactate			0
lactate is actually a by - product of the metabolic process and serves as a buffer and slows down the rate at which the cells become acidic			0
" people produce lactate all the time , even at rest			0
it clears your system 30 - minutes to one - hour after working out , " says @entity14			0
a study in @entity112 in sports medicine found that @entity9 is the result of microtrauma in the muscles and surrounding connective tissues , which causes inflammation			1
the reason that eccentric muscle contraction ( think lowering a dumbbell back down in a biceps curl ) is more likely to be the culprit is because it places a higher load on your muscles compared to concentric contraction			2
" it 's the active lengthening of muscle fibers under load			2
it 's like you 're pulling on a rope , and there 's so much force that the rope starts to tear and pull apart , " says @entity14			0
@entity135 : 5 exercise machines that are n't worth your time myth # 2 : it 's not a good workout unless you get @entity9			1
we often wear our doms as a badge of honor and believe that if we 're not sore , we 're not doing enough during out workouts			0
but that 's just not true			0
" it does n't mean that you 're not getting as good of a workout because you 're not crippled the next day , " says @entity147 , @entity148 certified personal trainer			0
" you should feel [ soreness ] 24 hours to three days after the activity			1
if , after three days , you try to do the same exercise and you can not because you go immediately to muscle failure , you 've done too much			2
" according to @entity14 , studies have shown that soreness itself ( using a scale from 0 to 10 to assess the level of soreness ) is poorly correlated as an indicator of muscle adaptation and growth			1
there are many factors that influence how @entity9 presents itself in individuals			1
" there is great variability , even between people with similar genetics and even among highly - trained lifters [ and athletes ] , " he says			0
so while comparing notes ( and commiserating ) is all part of the process , soreness and @entity9 is n't the best gauge of how effective your workout was or who 's in better shape			1
myth # 3 : the more fit you are , the less susceptible you are to @entity9			1
it 's true that you will start to feel less sore as your body adapts to your workouts and learns to distribute the workload across your muscle fibers more effectively			2
that 's why you should regularly change up your exercise routine			0
however , there is also a genetic component to how sensitive we are to pain and soreness			2
" people can be no - responders , low - responders or high - responders to soreness , " says @entity14			2
if you 're a high - responder , you will experience @entity9 more acutely than someone who is a no - or low - responder when given the same training load			1
while you ca n't change your genes , it is important to know where you fall on the spectrum to understand how your body may respond to changes in your workouts			0
@entity135 : how to do a pull - up ( or add more reps ) myth # 4 : muscle damage is a bad thing			2
yes , @entity9 appears to be caused by trauma to your muscle fibers , but it 's not a definitive measure of muscle damage			1
in fact , a certain degree of soreness seems to be necessary			2
" when muscles repair themselves , they get larger and stronger than before so that [ muscle soreness ] does n't happen again , " says @entity147			1
while these mechanisms are not completely understood , @entity14 notes that some muscle trauma is needed to stimulate protein production and muscle growth			2
myth # 5 : pre- and post-workout stretching is a good way to prevent and treat @entity9			1
unfortunately , no. a review of studies for the @entity238 on the effects of stretching before or after exercise on the development of delayed - onset muscle soreness found that pre- and post-workout stretching did not reduce the effects of @entity9 in healthy adults			1
in fact , research has found that static stretching prior to working out does not safeguard you against injury and may actually decrease your power and strength			0
while you may not be able to avoid soreness altogether , @entity62 suggests advancing slowly with a new workout , giving your muscles time to adapt and recover			2
@entity147 recommends always including a proper warm - up ( including dynamic stretching ) , and cool - down period as part of your routine			0
stop waddling : how to recover from @entity9 there are a number of ways to alleviate those ca n't - make - it - up - the - stairs symptoms			1
a sports massage is one good way to reduce the effects			0
" a massage will move the fluid and blood around in your body which can help heal the microtrauma in your muscles better , " says @entity29			0
a study in the @entity277 found massage to be beneficial on both gait and feelings of post-workout soreness			2
other common ways to treat @entity9 include foam rolling , contrast showers ( alternating between hot and cold water ) , @entity287 salt baths , increased protein intake ( to increase protein synthesis ) and omega - 3 supplementation ( to reduce inflammation ) , and sleep			1
new research in the @entity294 of @entity295 suggests that supplementing with saffron may also help to alleviate @entity9			1
regardless of your preferred @entity297 , @entity29 recommends looking at your diet to make sure your taking in nutrients to help your body heal			0
" find a diet that can really help you feel the best that you can feel , " she says			0
@entity135 : are you foam rolling all wrong ? when it 's more than just @entity9 there may be times when you overdo it with your workout and feel bad			1
but when should you be concerned ? " if your level of soreness does not go down significantly after 72 hours and into the 96 hours mark , " says @entity14			2
@entity62 advises that if the pain becomes debilitating , you experience heavy swelling in your limbs or your urine becomes dark in color , you should see your doctor			0
if it 's an injury , you 're more likely to feel it immediately during your workout -- something that should never be ignored			0
@entity321 , on the other hand , will appear gradually , often the next day			0
" an injury will likely limit your range of motion and last longer than three days , " says @entity29			1
when all is said and done , @entity9 should n't be avoided or revered			1
but it should n't be your only gauge of your level of fitness or strength			0
" people think that the only part of their workout that matters is the hard part , " @entity147 says			0
" but , you can do more of the hard part if you do n't injure yourself			0
" long - term , @entity29 says , " you 'll build more muscle , strength and endurance if you give your muscles a chance to take a deep breath and recover			2

" @entity9 " is an acronym for delayed onset muscle soreness
@entity9 happens when you introduce a new activity or increase the intensity , volume
symptoms can also include reduced range of motion and joint stiffness
