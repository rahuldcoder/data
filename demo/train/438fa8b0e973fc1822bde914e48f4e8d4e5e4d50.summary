in the regional capital @entity11 , @entity1 militiamen guarded the airport and train station , some wearing armbands that proclaimed their allegiance to " the autonomous republic of @entity3			2
" flights into the region from @entity4 's capital , @entity21 , were canceled tuesday , while flights from @entity23 appeared to be landing as scheduled			0
a guard at the railway station told @entity26 that he and his comrades were looking out for weapons being shipped in from the rest of @entity4			0

" @entity42 fled @entity21 on february 22 , after three months of protests against his decision to scrap a trade deal with the @entity50 and embrace closer ties with @entity7			2
less than a week later , armed men seized the @entity3 parliament building in @entity11 and raised the @entity7 flag above it			1
@entity4 government forces in @entity3 have been surrounded in their bases by well - equipped troops wearing uniforms with no insignia -- troops @entity63 countries say are @entity7 but whom @entity23 calls local " self - defense " forces			1
the move has effectively severed the strategic peninsula , which has an ethnic @entity7 majority , from the rest of @entity4			2
@entity38 and @entity63 diplomats have urged @entity7 to enter into talks with @entity4 , but @entity7 officials have shown little interest			1

" @entity80 said monday that @entity77 had postponed a face - to - face meeting with @entity7 president @entity132 to discuss @entity38 proposals , which @entity23 has effectively rejected			1
the meeting would have marked the highest - level contact between the two countries since @entity7 troops took up positions in @entity3			1
the head of the @entity140 also said the referendum would be illegal			2
@entity143 foreign minister @entity142 , the @entity140 's current chairman , said holding the referendum without everyone affected being on board would " provoke tensions instead of leading to sustainable solutions			2
" @entity140 monitors have been denied entry into @entity3 by armed men several times since the crisis began			1
in a statement issued tuesday evening , @entity7 's @entity154 cited @entity157 's secession from @entity158 -- a move recognized by @entity63 governments over bitter opposition from @entity158 and its historical allies in @entity23 -- as precedent for the " absolutely legitimate " @entity3 vote			1

@entity186 foreign minister @entity185 also called the referendum illegal , tweeting on his official account tuesday that sanctions against @entity7 over its intervention in @entity3 could come as soon as this week			1
sanctions would include asset freezes and visa suspensions , he said			0
" we have a firm position , but still we are seeking a political solution , " @entity185 tweeted			0
" the only legitimate vote in @entity4 will be may 25 , the upcoming presidential election			2
" and @entity200 foreign minister @entity199 said his government 's current relationship with @entity7 can not continue unless the country heeds calls to calm the situation			2
" we are not only deeply worried , but we believe what is intended by @entity7 in view of the @entity3 is completely unacceptable , " @entity199 said during a visit to the former @entity208 republic of @entity209 , now a @entity211 ally and @entity50 member			1
@entity199 said @entity200 and @entity209 " agree that we will stand up to further escalations united and determined			0
" but in @entity3 , @entity1 forces were in firm control and warning loudly against " fascists " they claimed had seized power in @entity21			2
@entity221 , a volunteer at a militia camp in @entity11 , compared the protesters who rallied in @entity21 's @entity224 to topple @entity42 to " cockroaches			0

" the @entity224 was a provocation from start to finish , " said @entity237 , whose forces appeared to have close ties to the militia			0
" there was no democracy , and no real indignation from the people			0
it was a paid - for event			0
" and pro-russian billboards portray sunday 's choice as one between a free @entity7 and a @entity4 under the swastika			1
former @entity38 secretary of state @entity253 called that " one of the more outrageous placards i have ever seen			0
" " there are probably good - willed people who are concerned that their @entity261 brothers and sisters are all of a sudden being subjected to fascism or @entity264 , because that is what @entity7 tv is putting out , " @entity253 told @entity26 's " @entity257 " program			0
" there are a lot of older people who probably remember @entity270 and the tragedies that took place in @entity4 , and so this is just pure , unadulterated scare tactics , " @entity253 added			0
and @entity185 defended @entity4 's new government tuesday , saying it was " legitimately installed by the @entity4 parliament " and that the extreme right " is not represented			0
