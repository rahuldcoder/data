@entity1 members of the @entity3 legislative committee investigating gov. @entity5 's involvement in the @entity7 controversy blasted the panel 's work , calling it " a shiftless , broken political vehicle , " in a report released monday			1
republicans also called for an independent investigation into whether the committee misused taxpayer money for political purposes			1
the committee met monday to publicly release an interim report that failed to find any conclusive evidence tying @entity5 to the scandal			2
the report leaked to the press last week			2
but @entity1 used the meeting as a platform to release their own " minority statement , " slamming @entity27 co-chair @entity26 's handling of the probe into last year 's lane closings on the @entity30			1
" an opportunistic and power - hungry politician also used those reprehensible lane reassignments as cover , while leading a legislative committee to try to execute a two pronged political mission : take down governor @entity5 , the biggest political threat to state and national democrats , and in so doing , become the next @entity40 gubernatorial candidate , " the report said			0
state sen. @entity41 , a @entity5 ally , said during monday 's meeting that @entity1 planned to forward their report to the office of the state attorney general asking for an independent prosecutor to examine whether the committee misused taxpayer money for political purposes			1
" the committee was formed to stack the partisan deck against @entity1 in a way that was merely window dressing in the name of bipartisanship , " @entity41 said			0
" co-chairs never shied away from the microphone and camera to spread their prejudicial and predetermined outcomes			0
" @entity26 , meanwhile , said the process " may well serve as a great example , perhaps the greatest example , of legislative oversight in our state 's history			2
" he said that the committee was unable to interview key witnesses			0
the committee , he said , is ready to continue its work should more evidence become available .			0
