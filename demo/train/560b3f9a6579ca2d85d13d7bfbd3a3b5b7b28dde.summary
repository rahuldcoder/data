-- @entity1 and @entity2 , the parents of 22 - month - old @entity4 , did n't get many date nights , let alone an entire day together			1
so @entity1 was delighted the two were headed to a @entity7 , @entity8 , movie theater for some adult time			1
" i was just looking forward to spending the day with the love of my life , " a tearful @entity11 said wednesday			2
" and just to think that , in the blink of an eye , my whole world just got shattered into a million pieces , and now i 'm left trying to pick them up and put them all back together			0
and it 's so hard , and it 's so unbearable			0
" @entity11 , speaking for the first time since her husband was gunned down january 13 , wore a pink cast over her arm , covering a gunshot wound that police say she suffered while trying to protect her husband from @entity29 that harrowing afternoon			1
flanked by her attorneys , she spoke for only a minute , thanking those who have offered support and prayers in " this horrible time of grief and sadness			0
" her main focus right now is taking care of @entity4 , she said			2
" right now , i 'm just still trying to recover from the shock , " she said			1
asked how @entity4 was handling the loss of her father , attorney @entity39 said the toddler was fortunate to be so young			1
" i think we 're all lucky that she 's as young as she really is , " he said			0
" she does n't understand everything right now , so all she knows , i think , is that @entity46 's not there			1
and in my opinion , being a father , that 's enough			0
" @entity29 , a 71 - year - old retired @entity52 police officer , got into an altercation with @entity2 because @entity11 was texting @entity4 ' babysitter during the previews for " @entity56 , " police said			1
the 6 - foot - 1 , 270 - pound @entity58 , who was also with his wife for the matinee at the @entity62 in suburban @entity52 , left the auditorium , apparently to complain to management , police said			0
@entity58 returned " irritated , " a witness said			0
the argument continued and popcorn was thrown			0
" the defendant advised that the victim turned and stood up , striking him in the face with an unknown object , " a police report said			0
" the defendant advised that he removed the .380 - semi - auto handgun from his pants pocket , firing one round , striking the victim , and that he was in fear of being attacked			0
" the witness said after @entity29 shot @entity11 , he sat down and put the gun in his lap. @entity83 and @entity84 would not discuss many details of the case , but they did address @entity29 ' claim of self - defense and his defense team 's efforts to persuade a judge to grant him bail			1
" you can claim self - defense or you can claim your client had a mental health issue , " @entity84 said , explaining his opinion that @entity29 ' attorneys had limited options			2
" it 's one or the other			0
" @entity39 added that @entity11 " does n't understand what he was defending himself over			1
" for @entity29 to be eligible for bail on his second - degree murder charge , he would have to demonstrate that he is n't a flight risk and that he poses no danger to the community			1
defense attorney @entity107 told a judge earlier this month , to no avail , that @entity29 had close ties to the community , was a former @entity113 president , lived with his wife of more than four decades in a neighboring county , and had two children , one of whom is a @entity52 patrol officer with more than a decade of service			1
the attorney also said that @entity29 was the victim in the altercation and that @entity2 was the " aggressor			1
" neighbors and family friends told @entity0 affiliates that @entity29 was a friendly fellow , completely unlike the man described in news reports about the shooting			2
@entity11 's attorneys did not discuss whether @entity29 was a flight risk wednesday , but they both expressed doubt that the community would be safe if he was released before trial			1
@entity84 said he doubts anyone could " reasonably " convince a judge that @entity29 posed no risk to the public			2
" everyone with a cell phone is at risk			0
you never know when this guy 's going to go off again , " @entity39 added			0
the attorneys thanked @entity144 and @entity145 , where @entity2 worked , for arranging fund - raisers and setting up a memorial fund that has garnered about $ 20,000 for the @entity148			2
the attorneys said they will manage the fund and dole out the money as needed to @entity11 , whose hand is " getting better			0
