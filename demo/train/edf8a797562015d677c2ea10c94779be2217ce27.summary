-- @entity1 set itself up for yet another self - inflicted political wound , international humiliation , costly boycotts and historical shame now that its legislature has passed a bill giving people the right to discriminate			1
the bill was written by the @entity11 and a @entity13 legal organization called the @entity14			2
they were inspired , in part , by the case of a @entity19 wedding photographer who was taken to court after refusing to shoot a gay commitment ceremony			0
the bill seeks to shield @entity13 from members of the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community who dare to seek equal protection under the law			1
specifically , the bill protects all individuals , businesses and religious institutions from discrimination lawsuits if they can show that their discriminatory actions were motivated by religious convictions			1
under the guise of religious freedom , however , the bill would enable businesses potentially to discriminate against virtually anyone -- not just @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , agnostics and atheists , but also unwed mothers , rastafarians and @entity49 t - shirt wearers			2
this bill is arbitrary , capricious and antithetical to the spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood that inform our documents of freedom			2
it will lead to marginalization and oppression by allowing bigots to deny gay people access to virtually any business or service			0
the road to @entity66 genocide , @entity67 , @entity70 - @entity69 internment , the @entity64 and other iterations of human persecution began with laws that isolated and dehumanized entire groups of people			2
@entity1 's race relations and cultural politics are often misunderstood by the rest of the country			1
racial diversity and progressivism exist within the predominantly white and conservative power structure of the @entity1			1
this has created an interesting dynamic			0
@entity1 has sometimes made racial and cultural inroads ahead of the national curve , while fear of major demographic shifts , including a growing lgbtq community , and the erosion of white privilege have unearthed racial stereotyping , homophobia and xenophobic policies			1
many outside the state misunderstand this dynamic , assuming we are a wholly backward place without understanding that it is much more complicated than that			0
nevertheless , @entity1 now has the dubious designation as the first state to pass an anti-gay bill that seeks to shun and segregate in the name of religion			1
similar legislation has been put forward in @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
the @entity1 measure is the only bill that has passed			1
there is a saying : " history does n't repeat itself , but it rhymes			0
" the rhythm of chauvinism and acrimony in @entity1 endures			1
the state long resisted creating a holiday honoring @entity123 , which it finally did in 1992			0
it is not too late to shift course , however			0
gov. @entity127 has the power to put @entity1 back on the right side of history			1
the " right to discriminate " bill now sits on her desk			0
the bill passed thursday , she has five days to reject it or sign it into law			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			2

@entity142 : @entity1 legislature *approved* a bill that would allow discrimination
he says the bill shields those who show religion prompts their discrimination
he says bill aimed at @entity155 community but could affect many groups
@entity140 : @entity1 complicated , not as biased as often depicted
