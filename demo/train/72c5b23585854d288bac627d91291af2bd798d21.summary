@entity0 is an executive producer at @entity1 as well as author of the book " @entity4 : @entity6 's @entity5 and the @entity7 " ( @entity8 , june 2009 )			1
@entity5 , founder of @entity6 , is pictured in @entity9 in november 2007			1
( @entity1 ) -- the private military contractor formerly known as @entity6 has held classified contracts with the @entity12 for nearly a decade , but an allegation that the contractor was part of a secret @entity12 program to kill @entity18 operatives -- if true -- would take the relationship to a whole new level			1
the @entity12 hired the private security firm @entity6 in 2004 to work on a covert program aimed at targeting and potentially killing top @entity18 leaders , a source familiar with the program told @entity1			1
former company executives deny knowing about the program			0
current leaders of the company did not return calls to @entity1			0
the @entity12 wo n't comment on classified contracts			2
the classified program , canceled by @entity12 director @entity32 earlier this year , was part of a broader effort inside the @entity12 to develop the capacity to conduct training , surveillance and possible covert operations overseas , according to the source			1
the program was outsourced to contractors to " put some distance " between the effort and the @entity45 government			0
other contractors were brought in for other parts of the program , another source said , and @entity6 's involvement ended by mid- 2006			2
but one thing is clear : the company that renamed itself @entity6 earlier this year in an effort to escape controversy surrounding a 2007 shooting in @entity56 that left 17 @entity57 dead has had a long relationship with the world 's most famous spy agency			1
when @entity5 first opened his @entity6 training facility in the late ' 90s , his clients included special forces teams and law enforcement agencies from around the country			2
@entity5 had expressed frustration with the training facilities he visited during his time as a @entity70 , and a sizable inheritance allowed him the financial freedom to retire from the military and try his hand at creating a better facility			0
his first clients were indeed seal teams			0
but they also included teams from other government agencies , including the @entity12			2
case officers and protection details , the people generally accustomed to working in the shadows , began showing up for training on the shooting range or the driving track in a rural part of @entity88			0
when then - @entity12 executive director @entity90 , whose own son was a @entity70 , visited the facility , former @entity6 president @entity89 suggested he meet with @entity5 , who worked out of an office in the @entity95 area			1
the two had lunch and @entity90 immediately took a liking to the man who would later lead the world 's most notorious private contracting company			0
at the time , contacts like these were essential to building the business , so when terror struck the heart of @entity45 in september 2001 , @entity5 called up his new friend @entity90 and offered to help			0
sources inside the agency at the time say that @entity90 in fact , was pushing hard for @entity6 to be given the first urgent and compelling , no - bid contract to protect @entity12 facilities in @entity9			1
the military , it seems , was n't up to the task of staffing such an effort			0
once awarded the initial contract , @entity5 maintained a close relationship with @entity90 , and made trips to @entity9 to make sure things were going smoothly			1
the idea that the agency came to @entity6 for help on any other contracts , including one with the overall goal of locating and assassinating @entity18 operatives , would n't come as a huge surprise , particularly since so much of the intelligence budget is spent on private contractors			1
but with investigations under way into just what was done and by whom at the @entity12 under the @entity137 administration , people are remaining tight - lipped			2
especially under the threat of possible prosecution , should it go that far .			0

relationship between @entity6 and @entity12 goes back almost a decade
recent allegation says contractor was part of @entity12 program to kill @entity18 operatives
@entity6 was given contract to protect @entity12 facilities in @entity9 after 9/11 attacks
the private contractor renamed itself @entity6 earlier this year
