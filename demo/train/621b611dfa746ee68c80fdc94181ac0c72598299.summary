@entity0 -- we have reached @entity0 , the end of our almost 4,000 km journey from @entity5			1
here , i am meeting the former mayor @entity7			1
he ran the city for eight years from 1996 to 2004 , and before that was the speaker of @entity12 's legislative assembly for 15 years			1
the weather here is spectacular			0
it is in the 20s , and unusual to have such glorious warm days so late in the year			0
it makes the @entity17 glisten			0
@entity0 must surely be the most beautiful of cities			1
but the beauty should not mask the terrible financial mess the state faces			1
gallery : images from the journey it would take a voting catastrophe for president @entity27 to lose in @entity12			1
the state has n't voted for a @entity30 presidential candidate since 1988			1
but the president ( and the country ) must listen closely to the trends coming from here , because what starts in @entity12 often ends up spreading across the country			1
also there are some crucial @entity39 elections which , if they go badly , would make it much harder for the @entity40 to regain control of the @entity42			0
in @entity12 they are worried about the economy and jobs			1
the unemployment rate , at 10.2 % , is the third highest in the country			0
immigration and health are also big concerns			0
but here , they are used to a higher standard of living and superb college system : one which is now crumbling			0
there is a state budget deficit which would make even the eurozone blush			2
in may the @entity59 , @entity60 , announced the deficit was $ 16 billion			0
with the potential to balloon even higher unless something is done			0
read more : @entity65 's university worlds apart with these facts , today 's @entity12 is starting to look a lot like austerity @entity68			1
over the past few years , @entity12 has made deep cuts in education , social services , and even releasing some prisoners early to save money			2
it has proposed raising income and sales taxes to close this stubborn budget gap , that is dangerously large and wo n't go away while the economy languishes			0
in the past , when @entity12 fell on hard times , it could rely on a rising national economy to pick up the slack			1
after all , the @entity88 economy is one large locomotive , and when one state falls on hard times the others can lend a hand			2
that ca n't happen this time , because nationally there is no extra economic oomph to pick up the slack			0
it is exactly the same as the eurozone , where even the @entity102 growth engine ca n't pull everyone out of recession			0
as the @entity106 noted in the latest @entity107 , everyone is cutting deficits at the same time and this makes a bad situation worse			0
@entity12 is as much a victim of this as any @entity68 country			2
@entity114 : will frontier state call election ? i do n't want to push this analogy too far			0
@entity12 's economy is in better fundamental shape than many eurozone countries			1
what i am suggesting is that the @entity68 austerity , which so far has not hit most of @entity88 , has well and truly arrived			2
this trend setting state is one of the first to truly feel the longer - lasting effects which i have no doubt will spread -- whoever wins the election			2
austerity @entity12 is a glimpse of the future for @entity88 ; the rest of the country , blinded by extravagant election promises , just does n't yet realize it .			1

@entity1 's @entity136 has arrived in @entity0 , where he will meet former mayor @entity7
this is a beautiful city but the state of @entity12 is in a financial mess
whoever is voted president must watch the trends coming from this state closely
the state is in times of austerity -- *reflecting* what is happening in the eurozone
