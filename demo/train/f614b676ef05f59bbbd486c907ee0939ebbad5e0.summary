@entity0 -- a decision on if researchers can study @entity7 's brain for clues to the @entity11 veteran 's suicide will wait until his family meets with elders from their @entity15 culture , his family said monday			1
@entity7 , 43 , died of a gunshot wound at his @entity18 , @entity19 , home wound last week in what the coroner concluded was a suicide			1
there has been speculation about whether repeated hits to his head over his 20 - year pro football career could have been a contributing factor			1
@entity7 's parents , who are from the island of @entity32 , @entity33 , were meeting monday with @entity15 elders , according to @entity35 , who was @entity7 's pastor			1
" the seau family is currently revisiting several important family decisions and placing them on hold in order to confer with their elders , " a family statement said			2
" all possibilities are being considered , but none will be acted upon until the @entity45 arrive at an agreed upon direction			0
" while there was no evidence @entity7 suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity54 ) , a degenerative disease brought on by multiple concussions , friends and family have stepped forward to say the legendary linebacker suffered a number of hits to the head during his career			1
researchers have contacted the @entity7 family to request the opportunity to study his brain , @entity35 said last week			1
while @entity35 did not identify the researchers making the requests , among the institutions the family could donate @entity7 's brain to is @entity69 for the @entity70 , the research center that found former @entity72 safety @entity71 suffered degenerative damage to his brain because of repeated hits			1
@entity71 committed suicide , shooting himself in the chest in 2011 and leaving a suicide note that said he wanted his brain studied for possible damage			0
while @entity7 left no such note , he did aim the handgun at his chest			0
" @entity82 taking the shot to the chest makes sense that he would want his head examined , " @entity35 said			0
as a linebacker , @entity7 played " the most havoc - ridden position on the team			0
he suffered many concussions , so there is a strong sense that it played a role , " said @entity35 , who is also the chaplain for the @entity90 , the team for which @entity7 played 13 seasons			0
seau 's death follows last month 's suicide of former @entity102 safety @entity100 , the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the @entity11 over concussion - related injuries			2
the lawsuit names more than 1,000 professional players			0
both @entity107 and @entity71 exhibited symptoms of repetitive head trauma : memory lapses , anger and deep depression , according to family and friends			0
and in both cases , researchers found signs of brain trauma			0
the @entity11 has repeatedly dismissed the lawsuit 's allegations that the league concealed links between football and brain injuries , saying player safety is a priority			2
" any allegation that the @entity11 intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit , " it said			0
@entity7 does not appear to have participated in any of the pending lawsuits against the @entity11			2
@entity1 's chief medical correspondent , dr. @entity131 , warned against drawing a conclusion in @entity7 's case , though he said there are striking similarities between his death and other cases involving football players			1
the only way to determine if @entity7 suffered @entity54 is to analyze the brain tissue for " hallmarks of the dementia - like disease , " @entity131 said			2
" we ca n't know , " unless @entity7 's brain is analyzed in this way , whether his death was related to @entity54 , he said .			1

a decision on a brain study is " on hold " while @entity7 's family consults @entity15 cultural elders
researchers want to study the @entity11 veteran 's brain , a close friend says
@entity7 , 43 , died of a self - inflicted gunshot wound at his @entity18 , @entity19 , home
there 's speculation about if hits to his head during his football career were a factor
