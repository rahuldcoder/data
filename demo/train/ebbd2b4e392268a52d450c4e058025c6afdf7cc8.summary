the girl scout cookie ca n't seem to catch a break			1
under fire in years past for including trans fats , high fructose corn syrup and palm oil in its cookies , the @entity4 ' current cookie selling season is under fire because of policies that have nothing to do with the actual composition of the cookies			1
a group calling itself @entity17 has posted a @entity19 video calling for a boycott of girl scout cookies in response to a @entity25 troop 's decision to allow a 7 - year - old transgender child into its troop			1
gay rights and transgender rights groups have reported a grassroots @entity31 movement of supporters buying girl scout cookies in response to the video			1
" i 've decided to purchase as many boxes as my modest budget will allow and donate them to the local lgbtq community center , " says @entity35 , a lesbian stay - at - home mom in @entity36			0
" i want to show support for @entity4 in their honorable decision to allow all girls to participate in their programs			2
however i do not want that support to show itself on my thighs , so i will donate the entire cookie order ! " after an initial burst of publicity around the nearly 8 - minute video featuring a teen @entity53 wearing a @entity53 sash , the video has been made private on @entity19			0

" i ask all fellow @entity4 who want a true , all - girl experience not to sell any @entity4 cookies until @entity4 ( @entity4 ) addresses our concerns , " says the girl , identified as a teen named @entity59 , a troop member from @entity60 , in some news reports			1
" i ask all parents who want their girls to be in a safe environment to tell their leaders why you will not allow your girls to make any more money for @entity4			2
" the video was prompted by the case of @entity77 , whose mother told a @entity80 affiliate in october that a troop leader initially told her that @entity77 could n't join the troop because @entity77 " has boy parts , " even though her child identifies as a girl			0
the @entity4 of @entity25 blamed the initial decision to exclude the child on ignorance of the scouts ' policy			2
the state scouts said @entity77 was welcome to join @entity4			2
" if a child identifies as a girl and the child 's family presents her as a girl , @entity4 of @entity25 welcomes her as a @entity53 , " said the @entity92 , in a statement to a @entity80 affiliate			2
the @entity101 website says that the @entity4 use cookie income to promote " abortion and @entity31 agendas , " introduces @entity4 to " the concept of sexual rights for children without parent consent " and is rewriting badge books to include " radical activists and gay role models			1
" on its website , @entity17 states that the group is comprised of current and former @entity4 , leaders , parents , volunteers and lifetime members			1
when contacted via its listed @entity120 account to comment , someone replied that the group 's " legal counsel has advised us not to comment or do interviews until further notice			0

" it 's been a really good place for kids to learn things			0
( this controversy ) will die down			0
we as a society are progressing and the outdated reactionary attitude that poor girl was put up to in that video , those attitudes are dying out			0
" other @entity31 groups are taking a tongue - in - check approach to the debate , encouraging people to eat more girl scout cookies			1
" girl scout cookies may not be so great for your waistline but they are great for being inclusive , " says @entity149 , spokeswoman for @entity150 ( @entity150 )			1
