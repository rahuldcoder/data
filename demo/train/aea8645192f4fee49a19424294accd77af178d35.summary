the @entity33 , the sport 's national governing body , said the trio 's conviction and sentencing was " a sad day for @entity30 cricket			1
" spokesman @entity39 said in a statement : " instead of having pride in playing for their country , these players chose to disappoint their supporters , damage the image of their country and bring the noble game of cricket into disrepute			2
there is little sympathy in @entity30 for the sorry pass they have come to			1
" he said the board was determined to stamp out corrupt behavior within cricket and will introduce measures to do that			0
these include better training in the game 's rules and ethics for players , alongside stricter monitoring , a strengthened code of conduct for agents and others involved in the game and a recommendation to the government to pass a law making corruption in sport a criminal offense			2
@entity78 , former cricketer turned politician , told domestic channel @entity81 after the sentencing : " for @entity30 and for @entity3 cricket this is extremely detrimental			1

" i do know how much damage this has done to the game , a game which i love more than anything else in the world			2
" i did decide many months ago that i wanted to admit that i deliberately threw two no - balls ( fouls ) at the @entity137 last summer			0
but i know this was very late , and i want to apologize for not saying it before			0
i did n't find the courage to do it at the beginning , and i know very well that made everything much more difficult			0
" the @entity3 are among the lowest - paid of the main cricket nations , partly due to the loss of much - needed revenue from hosting tours			0
