-- despite all the clatter about what 's inside the new @entity5 console , games were in the forefront of everyone 's mind during wednesday 's @entity10 launch event			1
what titles can i play ? what will they look like ? and when can i play them ? only a handful of games were actually showcased during the event in @entity19			1
but @entity10 said nearly 150 developers are committed to making games for the @entity5 , so the lineup will continue to grow throughout the year			1
wednesday 's event brought some startling revelations , such as @entity25 bringing its " @entity32 " from pcs to consoles and @entity28 teasing a new " @entity30 " game announcement at @entity31 this year all of these games are being made for the @entity5 , and some are also being made for the @entity35 because of lack of backwards compatibility for the new console			1
it will be interesting to see how much consumers will transition from the old box to the new one if these new games are still being produced for the @entity35 as well			2
here are five upcoming games ( in no particular order ) that looked especially promising			2
release schedules are still vague			0
' knack ' presented by lead system architect @entity48 as his own vision of games for the @entity5 , " @entity55 " showed off the graphical capabilities of the new console and its ability to manipulate many objects on the screen at once			1
the game follows the exploits of @entity55 , a robot - like being with a talent for summoning surrounding objects to change its shape and acquire new abilities			1
the animation looks like something from @entity66 or @entity67 , but the gameplay appears more in line with a " @entity71 " title			2
it looks cute and family friendly			0
' @entity74 : @entity75 ' developed to appear to the hardcore gamer , " @entity74 : @entity75 " is the fourth installment in the violent " @entity74 " shooter series			1
this chapter takes players back into interplanetary battle against the @entity83 menace			0
based on the trailer , the gameplay takes place in a futuristic urban environment with lots of sparkle and shine			0
early glimpes of the game show smooth - looking animation , persistent effects and plenty of action			0
this " @entity74 " looks on the surface like a standard shooter game , but the stunning graphics on the @entity5 may be enough to raise it to a higher level			1
' @entity102 ' " @entity102 " was first previewed at last year 's @entity31 ( @entity31 ) to rave reviews			2
but it 's console functionality was unclear -- until wednesday night			2
set in an alternate version of @entity107 , the action - adventure game lets you assume the role of a rogue vigilante who hacks into computer systems to track down and eliminate criminals			2
a live demo showed off the many ways a player can interact with his surroundings and other characters			0
the action , and the protagonist 's movements , appear to be organic and free flowing			0
it looks like an open - world environment , although i wonder how much the story will drive where you go			0
' the witness ' this indie puzzle title has drawn great interest from fans			1
was it the game 's intriguing quietness during a launch event filled with fireworks ? was it the serene , inviting tropical - island environment , filled with bright colors and soothing music ? creator @entity141 , who also made " @entity145 , " said his team worked hard to eliminate repetitive action in a game that will take 25 hours to complete			1
given the critical success of the similar " journey " last year , this game should do very well			0
' @entity149 ' ( working title ) " @entity149 " really showed off what the @entity5 engine can do			1
its new trailer details a showdown between medieval humans and a fire - breathing dragon in a subterranean lair			0
the battle scenes were intense , and the sword - toting dungeon crawlers moved realistically as rubble rained down on them			0
in a twist , the game paused during a particularly tense scene as a player sent a note to a friend asking for help			0
