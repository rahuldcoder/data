-- @entity2 finance ministers meeting in @entity3 , @entity4 , on monday will discuss giving @entity5 an extra year to meet its deficit targets			1
@entity5 had been told to cut the difference between its income and spending to within 5.3 % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) by the end of 2012			1
but @entity14 sources tell @entity0 that ministers will probably revise that goal upward to 6.3 % monday , in accordance with a draft put forward by the @entity19 late friday			1
as part of the plan , @entity5 will be asked to cut its headline deficit to 4.5 % of gdp for 2013 and 2.8 % for 2014 , the sources said			1
the ministers are meeting 10 days after their heads of government agreed to use the bloc 's temporary bailout funds to recapitalize @entity5 's ailing financial system and to set up a joint supervisory body for the area 's lenders			2
the aim of monday 's summit is to figure out how to implement those proposals , though @entity14 insiders are doubtful the politicians will put numbers on the page yet			2
one official close to monday 's discussions said they are likely to include the so - called @entity44 group of lenders , which includes the @entity14 commission , the @entity43 and the @entity47			2
" there 's still some technical work that needs to be done , " said the official , speaking on the condition of anonymity			0
" as such , they ( finance ministers ) are aiming for more of an agreement in principle rather than a commitment			1
" a month ago , the same eurozone finance ministers agreed to put aside 100 billion euros ( $ 150 billion ) to shore up the capital base of @entity5 's banks -- money that will come initially from the region 's nonpermanent @entity62			1
audits commissioned by the @entity5 government recently showed the sector is likely to need 60 billion to 70 billion euros in extra cash to stay solvent			0
but the eurozone seems to be far from the point of disbursing that money			0
' " we may well hear talk of brackets rather than final numbers , " the official told @entity0			0
that may be hard for the bond markets to digest			0
ahead of the gathering , the yield on @entity5 's 10 - year bonds surpassed the 7 % level that forced @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 to accept bailouts			2
when it comes to @entity82 , it seems that @entity3 is less optimistic about whether any headway would be made			0
" the expected outcome is likely to be less concrete , " the official said			0
" the idea is essentially for the new @entity82 finance minister to outline his government 's policy intentions and for the @entity44 to give an initial reading about how things have gone thus far			0
'' finance ministers for the eurozone will meet at 5 p.m. local time in @entity3 on monday			1
a broader gathering among the full @entity14 finance ministers will take place tuesday .			1
