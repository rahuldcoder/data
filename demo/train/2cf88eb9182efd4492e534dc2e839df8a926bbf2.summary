-- internet explorer can no longer claim more than half of the web 's traffic , as of october , ending more than a decade of the default @entity8 browser 's reign			1
@entity10 's hold on 62.17 % of mobile traffic has reduced @entity13 's overall share of web browsing , despite still claiming 52.63 % of desktop traffic , according to @entity16			1
the @entity8 browser 's diminishing share ( 49.6 % ) reflects its near absence from the realms of mobile and tablet , which now make up 6 % of web traffic			1
however , chances are , you gave up on @entity13 long enough ago that this milestone makes you more curious as to who actually still uses the browser			0
as of october , @entity29 is the second most popular web browser , accounting for 21.20 % of traffic , followed by @entity31 and @entity10 , which account for 16.60 % and 8.72 % respectively			1
@entity31 , which recently celebrated its third birthday , experienced the most expansion in october , increasing its share of the desktop market 1.42 %			0
@entity10 , the default browser in @entity38 's @entity37 and @entity39 , continues to increase its dominance over the mobile web , gaining 6.58 % of the market			2
@entity10 's share is increasing faster than the @entity37 's , probably due to how much mobile traffic is now driven by @entity39			2
as @entity13 loses its edge on the competition , we 're curious to know which browser our readers prefer			0
