@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 began casting votes thursday for a new president to take the place of the incumbent @entity7 , whose term expires next month			1
the election of a new president could be the first step toward solving a political impasse that has gripped @entity3 since february 's general election left a three - way split between the right , the left and a wild - card party			1
the presidential voting process is open to 1,007 elected representatives : the 630 deputies in the lower house , 315 senators plus four senators - for - life , and 58 regional delegates			0
the secret ballot is taking place inside the @entity28 , or lower house of @entity2			2
usually the senators vote first , then the deputies , then the regional delegates			0
they can vote for any citizen over 50 with full civil and political rights			0
after counting for the first round wrapped up , former trade union leader @entity34 was in the lead with 521 votes but short of the two - thirds majority , or 672 votes , needed to win the presidency			1
the center - left coalition led by politician @entity42 and the center - right coalition of former prime minister @entity44 appeared to be coming together to back @entity45			1
this would indicate a degree of cooperation between the two blocs , which might allow some kind of alliance to be formed			0
in second place was @entity53 , a former @entity3 @entity54 lawmaker and law professor , with 240 votes			1
former @entity58 mayor @entity57 received 41 votes			0
@entity44 's ex-wife , @entity60 , received one vote , despite expressing no desire to be president			2
according to the @entity3 constitution , a two - thirds majority of the electors is needed in the first three rounds of voting			2
from the fourth session onward , the bar is lowered to an absolute majority , equal to 504 votes			0
a second round of voting will take place later thursday			0
@entity7 's seven - year term expires on may 15			1
while the @entity3 presidency is largely a ceremonial role , it can become a critical one in times of political crisis			2
the issue has been that , under the constitution , the @entity3 president can not dissolve @entity2 and call for new elections in the last six months of his mandate			1
the election of a new president could help move @entity3 out of its current political gridlock			1
@entity42 fared the best in the february elections by leading a leftist coalition dominated by his @entity93 to a small majority in the lower house of @entity2 , but has been unable to form a government			2
power in the @entity98 , where it counts , was divided between @entity42 and @entity44 's center - right coalition , anchored by his party , @entity101 , or @entity101			1
@entity42 and @entity44 are archrivals who have previously indicated they will not work together			0
the wild - card party of @entity105 , the grass - roots @entity106 , will also not enter into an alliance			0
@entity1 's @entity109 and @entity110 reported from @entity0 , and @entity111 reported and wrote from @entity112 .			0
