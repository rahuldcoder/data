@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 knows quite a bit about disasters			1
five years ago , a 28 - foot storm surge from @entity7 flattened his house and almost wiped out his hometown of @entity0 , @entity1			1
now , if a rapidly growing oil spill in the @entity12 comes ashore -- as some expect -- @entity3 will be able to see it from the front porch of his newly - built house			1
" you can get mad about this , " he said			2
" i 'm very disturbed about it			2
" like residents along the coast of @entity22 and @entity23 , it is a waiting game for @entity0			2
already a heavy smell of oil hung over the @entity1 beaches			1
" this could not have happened at a worse time in our history , " said @entity27 , the town 's chief administrative officer			2
the city has undertaken half a billion dollars in new construction since @entity7			2
of that , $ 30 million is being spent on developing the harbor -- the third largest container port on the @entity37			2
" well , it if it threatens the commercial sea lanes , that 's a concern because if ships do n't come in and ships are n't able to go out , that stops commerce , " said @entity42 , the ceo of @entity43			2
equipment operator @entity47 knows all too well what that will mean			2
after @entity7 , he was out of work for a month			0
he is worried the fallout from the spill could be worse			0
" no ships , the warehouses are empty , no trucks , no imports , no exports , " he said			0
federal officials closed a portion of the northern @entity12 to fishing sunday , curtailing a billion - dollar business as high winds and choppy seas hampered efforts to corral a rapidly growing oil spill			1
the spill cast a pall over the annual @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity22 , one of many towns that make their living from the @entity12			1
@entity75 sen. @entity74 of @entity76 attended a boat blessing in @entity78 , @entity76 , where fishermen have observed the tradition for decades to usher in the shrimp season			0
" @entity82 are resilient and understand that in times like these , it is our traditions that tie us closer together and provide the strength we need to face the challenges ahead , " he said			0
" this tragic oil spill has reminded everyone about the valuable connection between our residents and our wildlife , fisheries and coastline			1
" in @entity98 , @entity76 , a rain - spattered president @entity97 told reporters his administration has launched a " relentless response " to the spill , but said the problem might not be solved for " many days			0
" a ruptured undersea well off @entity76 is spewing about 210,000 gallons ( 5,000 barrels ) of crude a day into the @entity12 , and efforts to shut off the flow have been unsuccessful since the late april explosion that sank the drill rig @entity110			1
the leading edge of the slick has grown closer to the coast of @entity22 and the @entity23			0
adm. @entity114 , the commandant of the @entity115 , told @entity2 's " @entity122 " that the slick was still nine miles off the @entity76 coast , but seas of 6 to 10 feet have made deploying booms to fend the spill off the coast " somewhat problematic			0
" oil giant @entity123 , which owns the well at the heart of the problem , said it had prepared massive boxes to be lowered over the leak points , but deploying them would take about a week			1
the minimum 10 - day fishing restriction imposed sunday by the @entity131 covers an area between the mouth of the @entity134 in @entity76 to the waters off @entity23 's @entity136			1
" balancing economic and health concerns , this order closes just those areas that are affected by oil , " @entity131 administrator @entity137 said in a statement announcing the decision			1
" there should be no health risk in seafood currently in the marketplace			0
" the @entity37 's commercial fishing industry brings in about $ 2.4 billion to the region			1
@entity150 , the @entity151 archbishop of @entity152 , officiated at sunday 's event in @entity70 and said the spill could have " widespread effects " on the area -- " not only the livelihood of people , but an entire way of life			0
" among those taking part in the blessing was @entity164 , who said , " you have to put your trust in someone			0
" " i really feel like , with the church and the bishop , i 've got my life in good hands , " @entity164 said			0
" @entity123 certainly is n't helping me			1
" the oil spill started april 20 , after an explosion on @entity123 contractor @entity175 's @entity110 drilling platform that left 11 men presumed dead			1
about 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion , the @entity115 said			1
" this event is a self - feeding fire , " said @entity179 of the environmental group @entity180			0
" it is so big and expanding so fast that it 's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective			0
" the spill will have " a multidecade impact " -- a " long - term poisoning " of the area , he said			0
booms were strung across the mouths of delta estuaries in @entity76 and inlets along the @entity1 coast			1
in @entity22 , @entity198 troops helped lay them out off @entity199 , at the southern end of @entity201			0
in @entity204 , @entity1 , a steady stream of customers stocked up on bags of freshly boiled crawfish , oysters and shrimp			1
the weekend trade was good , but owner @entity210 said he was worried about the future if the oil slick hits the coast			2
" all i know is seafood , " he said while sorting crawfish in a small workroom behind the kitchen			0
" i do n't know what we 'll do if this hits			0
it feels like a hurricane is coming , but what can you do to stop oil ? " the cause of the blast on the @entity110 remains unknown			2
@entity123 says a device known as a " blowout preventer " failed and has not responded to repeated attempts to activate it using remotely operated submarines			1
frustration with @entity123 was growing across the @entity37 , and @entity76 gov. @entity233 has said the company 's response has been inadequate			1
but @entity123 's president , @entity123 , told @entity238 's " @entity237 " that its focus " is dealing with the source of the oil , dealing with it on the surface , and dealing with it on the beach or the marsh if it occurs			1
" @entity248 said the company has built a containment system to prevent the leaking oil from spreading			1
but it may take another six to eight days to deploy that system , which is made up primarily of massive boxes designed to capture the crude			1
@entity123 spokeswoman @entity256 said the company is trying to use remote - controlled submarines to shut off the well at the ocean floor , about 5,000 feet below the surface , and spreading dispersants on and under the water to break up the slick			1
the company has put out about 300,000 feet -- roughly 60 miles -- of floating booms to keep the oil away from ecologically sensitive shorelines , she said			2
but she said efforts to skim oil off the surface were put off because of bad weather			2
" we 're hampered because the weather is so bad			0
some of the vessels ca n't get out , " she said			0
" so that slows us down a little bit			0
but they are still making the effort			0
we did get some photos back this morning that showed quite a bit of success			0
" @entity2 's @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity286 contributed to this report .			0
