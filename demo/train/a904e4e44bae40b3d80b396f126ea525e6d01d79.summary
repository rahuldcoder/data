fifty years ago , smoking was linked to cancer in the first surgeon general 's report on tobacco			1
on friday , dr. @entity5 , the acting surgeon general , issued the 32nd report on tobacco , saying " enough is enough			1
" his goal : eliminating the use of cigarettes and tobacco			0
in 1964 , when dr. @entity11 released the first surgeon general 's report , the public learned smoking causes lung cancer			1
at the time , 42 % of @entity17 adults smoked , @entity5 says			2
since then , " tobacco has killed more than 20 million people prematurely , " says dr. @entity18 , director of the @entity19 , in the forward to the new report			1
the number of smokers has dropped to 18 % in 2012 , according to the latest estimates published thursday by the @entity19			0
but " that still translates into 45 million people , including 3 million kids , " @entity5 says			1
" one out of three cancers is caused by tobacco ( and other smoking products )			2
" even though the number of smokers has gone down , the figures of those dying from disease linked to tobacco products are up			0
while 440,000 people died from smoking - related causes in 2008 , that number has risen to 480,000 people dying each year , according to the report			1
and even though the latest data suggests 87 % of lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking and secondhand smoke , more smokers age 35 and older die from heart disease than lung cancer			1
another alarming milestone , according to the report , is that women have caught up to men and for the first time are just as likely as men to die from smoking - related diseases			1
what 's new thirteen cancers are now linked to smoking and secondhand smoke			1
liver and colorectal cancer are added in this report			0
so far , there 's not enough evidence to say smoking causes breast cancer			2
smoking does not cause prostate cancer , according to existing evidence , according to the report			2
another finding : " exposure to secondhand smoke is a cause of stroke , " according to the report			1
people who do n't smoke themselves but are exposed to secondhand smoke have a 20 % to 30 % increased risk for a stroke			1

some 5.6 million children living today will die early because of smoking if things do n't change , the report warns			1
that 's one in 13 children , @entity5 says			1
@entity5 appears passionate about wanting to make smoking a thing of the past			1
the tools to do so already exist , he says , including making tobacco products more expensive			0
high - impact anti-smoking media campaigns , such as one the @entity19 conducted last year , as well as full access to smoking cessation programs may help			2
smoke - free laws are needed across the @entity17 , @entity5 says			1
" it 's embarrassing in this country only half our population is covered by those laws			0
" he says he believes using the @entity126 's authority to regulate tobacco products effectively and funding comprehensive statewide tobacco control programs at @entity19 - recommended levels will also help reduce smoking			2
" but the current rate of progress in tobacco control is not fast enough			0
more needs to be done , " according to the report			0
the @entity19 recommends spending $ 12 per person from taxes and tobacco settlement money to reduce smoking rates , @entity5 says			2
" right now , only just over a buck - fifty is spent per person			0
" his message to current smokers : " tell them it 's never too late to stop			0
it 's best to quit smoking completely			2
talk to your doctor , call 1 - 800 - quit - now			0
" he also recommends supporting those who want to quit			0
" it 's good for their health , your family 's health and the nation 's health			0
" goal of a tobacco - free generation @entity5 says he has a new formula to create a smoke - free generation			1
it ca n't just be a federal government attack on tobacco , he says ; the battle needs to be fought on the local level , too , with nongovernmental agencies , academia , faith - based organizations , health care professionals and businesses			0
@entity5 has his work cut out for him			0
he has to devise a plan to prevent teens from wanting to smoke -- most adult smokers begin smoking as teenagers , according to the @entity177			0
the new report backs that up , stating that 87 % of smokers had their first puff on a cigarette under the age of 18			0
and now kids have a new enticement : e-cigarettes			0
last year , a @entity19 report found the percentage of middle and high school students trying electronic cigarettes doubled from 3.3 % to 6.8 %			0
while the safety of e-cigarettes is still being hashed out , some health officials fear these electronic devices may be a gateway to tobacco cigarettes and other tobacco products			0
young people today do n't write letters anymore because they prefer to text , @entity5 says			1
he wants the younger generation to think of smoking like writing a letter -- that it 's no longer in vogue			2
as surgeon general , @entity5 oversees more than 6,500 public health professionals making up the @entity206			1
it 's the first uniformed service to go entirely smoke free , he says ; the others include the @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and the @entity213			2
