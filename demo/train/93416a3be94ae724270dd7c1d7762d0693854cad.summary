-- this weekend , " @entity1 : @entity5 " hunted down the no. 1 spot at the box office with $ 19 million from 3,372 theaters			1
although " @entity1 " can hardly be called a fairy - tale success at this point , it proved far more bewitching than fellow newcomers " @entity13 " and " @entity14 , " which were left with only bread crumbs in their sad debut frame			1
@entity15 and @entity16 spent $ 50 million to produce " @entity1 , " which was shot in 2011 and originally scheduled to be released in march 2012			1
distributor @entity15 moved the film 's release to this month to capitalize on star @entity19 , whom the studio hoped would blossom into a true box - office draw following " @entity22 " and " @entity23			1
" ( it also seems likely that " @entity1 " got placed in january due to its poor quality — january tends to be a dumping ground for studios ' stinkers			1
) whether or not @entity19 had anything to do with it , the date change proved at least somewhat effective — " @entity1 " outgrossed the last supernatural fantasy with @entity32 in the title , " @entity34 : @entity32 , " which staked a weak $ 16.3 million in its debut frame			1
@entity38 showings of " @entity1 " accounted for 55 percent of its weekend gross , while @entity41 made up 11 percent of the total			1
due to its r rating , the @entity44 tale played primarily to older audiences — 57 percent of crowds were above the age of 25 , and 55 percent were male			0
audiences issued the film a lukewarm " b " cinemascore grade , so it seems unlikely that @entity1 will achieve strong word of mouth			2
fortunately for @entity15 ( the studio suffered a rough winter with @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity60 — which passed $ 100 million this weekend ) , the film has already earned $ 35.8 million from international territories representing about 40 percent of the overseas market			2
last weekend 's box office champ , @entity65 , dropped 55 percent into second place with $ 12.9 million			1
with $ 48.7 million after 10 days , @entity68 's $ 15 million horror entry has officially surpassed @entity69 as 2013 ′ s highest grossing release			2
of course , that will change faster than you could say " @entity73 3 , " but it 's an impressive performance nonetheless			0
' @entity75 ' : big season 4 spoiler ! two @entity78 contenders finished in third and fourth place with almost identical weekend grosses — not to mention almost identical totals			0
" @entity83 " dropped by an incredibly small 7 percent in its 11th weekend to $ 10 million			2
@entity85 's $ 21 million drama continues to benefit from great word of mouth			2
and with $ 69.5 million so far and another month until the @entity78 still to go , director @entity89 's @entity88 is on track to finish above $ 100 million			2
" @entity92 , " meanwhile , fell by a steeper 38 percent to $ 9.8 million and $ 69.9 million total in its sixth weekend			0
the $ 40 million @entity94 drama will need to notch better holds if it wants to join fellow @entity97 nominees @entity99 , @entity34 , @entity100 , @entity101 , and @entity102 in the $ 100 million club			0
@entity104 to do ' @entity106 ' song at @entity78 @entity108 's annual action misfire " @entity13 " lived up to its low expectations , finishing in fifth place with $ 7 million from 2,224 theaters			1
@entity113 's shoot - em - up , whose budget was in the $ 35 million range , did n't get any boost from costar @entity118 , who proved unable to attract viewers outside her go - to rom - com genre			0
@entity13 opened short of @entity108 's last three leading efforts , safe ( $ 7.9 million debut ) , @entity124 , ( $ 9.3 million ) , and @entity125 ( $ 11.4 million ) , and it will likely finish below $ 20 million domestically			1
between @entity13 , @entity127 , @entity128 , and @entity69 , january has been a difficult month for non-fantasy gun - driven violence			0
but at least audiences enjoyed @entity13 — it earned a " b + " cinemascore grade			0
@entity1 : witch hunters -- $ 19.0 million 2			1
mama -- $ 12.9 million 3			0
@entity83 -- $ 10.0 million 4			0
@entity92 -- $ 9.8 million 5			0
@entity13 -- $ 7.0 million see the original story at @entity0			1
