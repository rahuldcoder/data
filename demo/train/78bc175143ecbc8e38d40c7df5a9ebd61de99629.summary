hopes to turn this humanoid robot into a seafaring fact in an effort to improve firefighting capabilities on board military vessels			1
currently at the development stage , the @entity9 ( or @entity10 for short ) is intended to combat fires in the cramped conditions of a ship , saving lives and costly equipment			0
armed with cameras and a gas sensor , the battery - powered @entity10 will be " capable of activating fire suppressors " and throwing " propelled extinguishing agent technology ( @entity21 ) grenades , " says the @entity3			1

furthermore , it will be able to interact with humans as part of a wider firefighting team			0
it is being developed in conjunction with researchers at @entity36 and the @entity37 , as a next step from @entity36 's @entity39 ( @entity40 with @entity41 ) robot			1
@entity39 - @entity39 is a five - foot tall humanoid robot built by students from the @entity45			0
the @entity3 says @entity10 will be tested on board the @entity47 -- a decommissioned landing ship dock used for fire fighting experiments -- towards the end of 2013 .			0

robot being developed by @entity3 will tackle fires on military vessels
autonomous robot will *launch* firefighting grenades and interact with human firefighters
