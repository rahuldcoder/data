-- i remember the exact moment when i first thought i could move back to @entity3 from @entity4			1
it hit me on a hot august morning on a visit to my sister in @entity8 , as i walked to a local coffee shop			1
" you could live here			2
" the thought was so foreign it caused a physical response			2
i stopped and shook my head , as though an errant bird had plowed into me			2
" no , i could not , " i said firmly to whatever voice had popped into my psyche			2
i could not possibly choose to live in a city that 's nickname was -- somewhat unrighteously -- " cowtown " over @entity25 , the city by the bay , the city where people leave their hearts , sing the blues and honeymoon , drinking @entity28 and lime			1
and yet , here i was , stopped on the sidewalk in the blistering morning sun , trying to decide if the next step i took was toward something hopeful and necessary or a step away from everything i believed was important to my life			2
this visit to @entity8 was just my latest over the past 18 months			1
i had started flying into @entity3 's capital city from where i lived in @entity25 because it was cheaper than flying into @entity40 , my true hometown , some 75 miles to the west , where my father lie battling pancreatic cancer			1
ours had been a complicated relationship , distant and wary			2
but in his final months , the past did n't matter			2
i understood -- finally -- that i wanted to be a daughter who sat by his side as often as i could until the very end because that 's who i was , not because i thought it would make him the kind of father i wanted him to be			1
after he died , everything shifted			0
@entity25 , where i had lived for the past six years working as a food writer and restaurant critic , no longer felt like home			1
wednesday 's story : can you vacation in your hometown ? how was that possible ? the job , the life , the city itself represented everything i had dreamed of from the moment i had shut the door on my family and @entity3 more than a decade before to first move to @entity4			1
i had flittered all over the @entity76 before finally landing in @entity25 , a city that quickly enchanted me with its fog and food			0
and yet now , in these months since my father 's death , i felt empty and lost			1
the city did n't seem to sparkle as brightly ; my job no longer offered the glow of accomplishment it once had			0
i continued to make pilgrimages to the @entity86 , longing for closeness to my sister who was starting to build her family and to a life that i somehow believed would be simpler than the one i was living on the @entity92			0
is n't that what so many of us are looking for when we consider moving home : an ease to living without complications , a time from our childhood when our concerns were no bigger than the towering soft serve ice cream cones we tried to balance while riding our bikes ? so i stood now on @entity103 , with the aroma of coffee beckoning me to move forward , and a voice in my head telling me i should stay			1
i could , of course , live here			0
i could quit my job with the @entity110 , pack up my studio apartment and drive to @entity8			0
i could find a job writing or cooking or something			0
and i could settle into what i imagined would be a quiet existence			0
because that 's what it would be if i moved to @entity8 , right ? just a simple life in my hometown state with the pop - up thunderstorms and fireflies of summer followed by college football games and @entity125 with snow			0
i believed @entity3 would not include traffic or crazy housing prices			1
i had myself convinced that the endless search for the next best restaurant or food trend would cease , too , because i would be finished with the food writing part of my career			0
and the snob i had become said i would be through with drama of relationships because there could n't possibly be anyone that could hold my interest or steal my heart in central @entity3			1
it all sounded so appealing , in those early weeks of grief after losing my second parent ( my mother had died years before )			0
i took the plunge : i did quit my job and move to @entity8 a few months after that summer morning			1
but aside from the fireflies and football and snow , none of it turned out as i envisioned			0
the traffic here can be brutal , and the housing prices in the past 10 years have fluctuated wildly			0
i 'm still chasing stories , mostly about food , just now at the @entity158			0
my desire to be close to family actually included making one of my own			0
i married a widower with three young children -- because my heart was stolen by not one person but by four			1
very few things about motherhood in general are simple or quiet and , i could argue , that 's doubly true with stepmotherhood			0
some might say -- and i do -- that the voice i heard on the sidewalk on that day was n't my own internal longing , but was capital " g " @entity174 calling me to a new life			2
i was n't called away			0
and i did n't run away			0
the middle of @entity3 did n't turn out to be my escape , but it was the beginning of a new kind of life			1
not one of tranquility -- in fact often the opposite -- but one that forces me to focus outward toward my family and my faith , not inward on my own fears and thoughts of self - importance			2
