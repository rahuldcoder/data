@entity0 needed to get back on the radar after his fellow @entity2 , @entity3 , jolted the political world this week with an announcement that he was considering a presidential run			1
the @entity8 senator got help from an unlikely source : president @entity11 @entity0 seized on @entity11 's decision to thaw relations with @entity14 to become the first -- and most forceful -- of the potential 2016 presidential contenders to oppose the move			1
he appeared on every major news network except for @entity18 on wednesday , hammering @entity11 as " willfully ignorant " on @entity19 - @entity14 relations and promising to do everything within his power as an incoming chairman of a subcommittee that handles @entity14 policy to " unravel " the administration 's plans			1
he spoke in both @entity27 and @entity28 , and couched his opposition in his own family story , as the son of two immigrants who fled @entity14			1
but more than an opportunity , seizing on the development is a necessity for the senator as he stares down the man — who has been a mentor of sorts to the young conservative star — that many @entity8 are calling the " elephant in the room " crowding others out of the presidential race			0
@entity3 's announcement on tuesday that he 's " actively exploring " a run for president immediately shifted the dynamic of the @entity8 presidential primary fight			0
many political observers believe that @entity0 wo n't run if @entity3 does — and , more than that , @entity0 ca n't run if @entity3 does			1
indeed , @entity8 donors say his announcement has already begun to lock up much of the establishment money			0
and with the political establishment already speaking out in favor of @entity3 , @entity0 's path to the nomination has narrowed			1
@entity3 associates insist the two are n't at odds on the @entity14 issue , noting the former governor also came out staunchly opposed in a statement later wednesday			1
" i do n't see how this is a ' fight ' between them , " a spokeswoman said			0
" the president made a very ill - advised decision and two @entity2 leaders who have engaged on the issue for decades engaged			0
" but the @entity19 policy shift on @entity14 offers @entity0 a unique opportunity to regain control of the national spotlight , and draw a stark comparison with @entity3 in style , if not in substance			1
@entity78 , a @entity2 - based @entity8 operative with ties to @entity0 , noted that he came out early and aggressively on the issue , where @entity3 hesitated			1
" all the way across the board he was the guy you could count on yesterday to correctly assess the situation			0
he became the counterweight against the the president , " he said			0
" @entity3 handled it , but it was later in the news cycle			0
" the issue of @entity19 - @entity14 relations also gives him an opportunity to show his ability to get things done on @entity96			2
incoming senate majority leader @entity97 said he 's on board with whatever @entity0 says on the issue			2
and if the senator keeps his promise to block the administration 's moves at every opportunity , he 'll keep his name and message in the media even as other @entity8 contenders ramp up their own campaigns and draw much of the party 's attention			2
but more than that , the administration 's announcement was an opening for @entity0 to highlight what his supporters say is his best rationale for running — and why his choice , aides insist , will have nothing to do with what @entity3 decides : his compelling personal story			2
the party acknowledged after the 2012 elections that it ca n't compete nationally if it does n't mitigate its deep deficit with @entity127			0
both @entity0 and @entity3 are seen as credible messengers to that demographic group — they both speak fluent @entity28 , and @entity3 's wife was born in @entity131			2
but @entity0 is the son of immigrants , and his supporters say that gives his message a particular resonance			2
and they note that he 's one of the youngest potential contenders in the field			0
" the @entity14 situation ties into everything that makes @entity143 , which is he understands , from the position of a son of two immigrants , what it means to come from a country like that to this one , " said @entity138 , a @entity8 fundraiser and @entity0 supporter			1
" it fits into what i believe , if he runs , his theme is going to be — which is the lack of belief in the @entity157 , " he added .			0
