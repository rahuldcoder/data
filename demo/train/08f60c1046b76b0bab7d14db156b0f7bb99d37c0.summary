-- behind the wheel of a sport utility vehicle , deposed @entity4 president @entity3 on thursday started his journey from @entity6 , @entity7 , to the country 's border with @entity4			1
@entity4 soldiers block the road at the @entity4 - @entity7 border in @entity13 , @entity4			0
a caravan of @entity3 supporters and reporters headed north to the city of @entity18 , close to the @entity4 border			2
from there , @entity3 would finalize his plans to cross back into @entity4 , he said at a news conference before departing			2
the ousted president stated his intention to return to his homeland this week , raising concerns about increased unrest			1
the days since the june 28 military - led coup that deposed @entity3 have been marked by mostly peaceful demonstrations by supporters and detractors of the government of interim president @entity34			1
one notable exception was an attempt by @entity3 to return by plane on july 5 , only to be turned away by military vehicles blocking the airport 's runways			1
one man was killed in clashes between @entity3 supporters and police			0
when asked about @entity3 's stated return , @entity46 assistant secretary of state @entity45 called it " unwise			1
" " any step that would add to the risk of violence in @entity4 or in the area , we think would be unwise , " @entity45 said			2
@entity3 told reporters he hopes that border guards in @entity4 will recognize him as president and commander in chief , and put down their weapons when he attempts to cross as early as friday			1
" we go with a white flag , with a flag of peace , " @entity3 said			0
@entity34 's government , which has vowed to arrest @entity3 on charges of violating the constitution , announced on thursday a curfew in the border area with @entity7 from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. , the newspaper @entity62 reported			1
a less restrictive curfew remained in effect in other parts of the country , the paper said			0
the backdrop to the tensions following @entity3 's caravan is a peace agreement offered wednesday by @entity78 president @entity77 , who mediated two rounds of unsuccessful talks between the two sides			1
the document , dubbed the @entity83 , calls for @entity3 's return to power , the creation of a unity government , and early elections			1
the accord was very similar to an original plan suggested by @entity77 , but with more details and a creation of a truth commission to investigate the events that led to the crisis			0
it also included a timeline for its implementation , which placed @entity3 back in @entity4 by friday			0
but @entity3 seemed intent to return on his own timeline , as neither side has signed the agreement			2
hopes were slim that the agreement would be signed , as the @entity3 camp publicly said it rejected the document , and @entity34 's side said it would have to seek approval from the other branches of government before proceeding			1
the @entity4 supreme court has said it would not accept @entity3 's return under any circumstances			1
on thursday , the @entity46 and the @entity113 expressed support for the @entity83			0
" a favorable response to this proposal opens a path of reconciliation , " oas secretary general @entity115 said at a news conference in @entity117			0
" a rejection of this proposal opens a path toward confrontation			0
and i want to say very frankly , we do n't want a path toward conflict			0
" the @entity4 political crisis stems from @entity3 's desire to hold a referendum that could have opened the door to extending term limits by changing the constitution , even though the congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court ruled it illegal			2
@entity3 was removed from office june 28 in a military - led coup and replaced by congressional leader @entity34 a few hours later			0
the coup has drawn international condemnation , including demands by the @entity144 , the @entity113 and the @entity145 that @entity3 be reinstated			0
@entity34 has steadfastly rejected that a coup took place , saying @entity3 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power .			2
