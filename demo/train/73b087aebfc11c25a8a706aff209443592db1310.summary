@entity0 , the onetime @entity2 athlete turned murder suspect , must undergo a month of psychiatric testing before his trial can continue , the judge in the case ruled wednesday			1
the move puts his trial on ice indefinitely			0
it was triggered by the testimony of a psychiatrist who testified that the sprinter has suffered from generalized anxiety disorder since he was an infant , stemming partly from the amputation of both of his lower legs because of a genetic defect			0
@entity0 is accused of murdering his girlfriend , the model @entity23 , in his home last year			1
@entity0 , 27 , does not claim he was insane or mentally incapacitated when he shot her , but when the defense put the psychiatrist on the stand , it raised the question of the athlete 's mental health , the judge said wednesday			2
" a doubt has been created " that @entity0 may have a psychiatric issue that would affect the court 's verdict , so she must order the testing , judge @entity33 said wednesday			1
" the accused may not have raised the issue that he was not criminally responsible at the time of the incident in so many words , but evidence raised on his behalf can not be ignored , " she said of testimony by dr. @entity40			0
she acknowledged that her order would mean a long delay in the trial , but said that was not the most important consideration			0
" this is not about anyone 's convenience , but about whether justice has been served , " she said			0
" the aim of the referral is not to punish the accused twice , " @entity33 said , saying that @entity0 should be examined as an outpatient rather than committed to an institution if possible			1
expert report @entity63 will reconvene on tuesday for her to issue her order formally , she said			0
at that point , @entity0 will learn when and where he will be tested			2
the prosecutor had argued in favor of psychological evaluation , while the defense argued against it			0
the testing will be done by a panel of experts who will then submit a mental health report to the court , @entity72 legal analyst @entity71 said			1
at one extreme , they could find that @entity0 was mentally incapacitated at the time he killed @entity23 , which would end the trial immediately in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness , she said			1
but it would also mean @entity0 needs to be committed to a mental health institution against his will until he is found not to be a danger , she said			2
another option is that they could find he had " diminished responsibility " at the time he killed @entity23			1
in that case , the trial would continue and his mental health would be taken into consideration during sentencing if he is found guilty , said @entity71 , a criminologist and law lecturer at the @entity97			0
the third possibility is that the experts could disagree with the defense psychiatrist and say that @entity0 ' mental health is not an issue at all			2
if that happens , @entity40 's testimony will be disregarded , @entity71 said			0
the experts might not all agree with each other , and lawyers on either side could disagree with the experts ' report , leading to any number of possible outcomes			2
if there is any dispute , the final decision about what to do with the experts ' report lies with judge @entity33			1
mistake or murder ? @entity0 admits shooting @entity23 but says he thought there was an intruder in his house			1
he has pleaded not guilty			0
the athlete 's defense team is trying to show that @entity0 made a genuine mistake and responded reasonably on the night he shot @entity23 , 29 , a model and law school graduate			1
if the trial continues after the psychiatric evaluation , judge @entity33 must decide whether @entity0 genuinely made a mistake or whether he murdered @entity23 intentionally			1
if she does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder , she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to at least 15 years in prison , and possibly life			0
@entity138 does not have the death penalty			0
if @entity33 accepts that @entity0 did not know @entity23 was the person he was shooting at , she could find him guilty of culpable homicide , a lesser charge than murder , or acquit him , according to @entity72 legal analyst @entity71			1
a verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at @entity33 's discretion			2
the prosecution rejects the sprinter 's defense that he mistakenly thought he was defending himself and his girlfriend from an intruder			2
the state contends that @entity0 argued with @entity23 before killing her			1
the defense team is seeking to cast doubt on the state 's case and needs to show only that there is a reasonable doubt that @entity0 meant to kill @entity23			1
there is no dispute that @entity0 fired four bullets through a door at @entity23 in his home early on the morning of @entity164 2013			2
three hit her , causing devastating wounds			0
the final shot struck her head and probably killed her almost instantly , a pathologist testified in march			0
the trial has seen @entity0 break down repeatedly , crying , wailing and sometimes throwing up as the court sees and hears evidence about @entity23 's death			1
@entity40 said the athlete 's physical distress was real			0
