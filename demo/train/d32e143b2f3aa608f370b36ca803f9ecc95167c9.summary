-- @entity1 is hoping a derelict airport on the outskirts of @entity4 -- one which has sparked a keen contest among international investors -- will help solve its debt woes			1
@entity12 airport , the sale of which initially piqued the interest of @entity15 business tycoon @entity14 , could be vital to reversing the fortunes of the @entity1 economy			1
@entity1 is awaiting a financial lifeline of 31.5 billion euros [ $ 40.3 billion ] from international creditors , following the approval of a 13.5 billion euro austerity package by @entity1 lawmakers earlier this month			2
alongside aid packages and austerity measures , @entity1 is selling off assets from gas reserves to sewage works as it tries to gain control of its 340 billion euro pile of debt			1
and while the potential sale of @entity1 's coveted islands caught early -- and controversial -- headlines , hopes are now resting on the dilapidated airport as a potential economic savior			1
four property developers -- @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity42 @entity41 -- have been shortlisted by the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) to win exclusive rights to the site			0
the bidders did not respond or were unavailable for immediate comment			0
a fund spokesman declined to disclose the airport 's potential purchase price but says redeveloping the land will cost around 6 billion euros			2
the fund has projected a redevelopment of the site will bolster @entity1 's gross domestic product , which has contracted by 39.5 billion euros in the past five years to 171.4 billion euros , by 0.3 % over the next ten years			1
@entity1 's vast , derelict , symbol of hope @entity12 airport was once @entity1 's flagship terminal and hub for international travel , but has been abandoned since its closure in 2001			1
it stretches across 6.2 million square meters -- making it roughly twice as big as @entity64 's @entity63 -- and it represents a huge commercial project for investors			0
the @entity1 government has put the full plot of land up for sale in an effort to raise revenues , spur growth and create jobs			2
the site is the largest open regeneration project in @entity77 and could create up to 9,000 jobs immediately , according to the @entity43			0
but 6 billion euros is a significant sum to inject into a country whose financial crisis has left the eurozone teetering on break - up			0
" the @entity1 financial system is in trouble and it 's very difficult to raise this kind of money in the private sector , " the fund spokesman told @entity0			1
" also , the international banking system has not been prepared to take that kind of risk on @entity1 up to now			2
" @entity94 , an academic from the @entity95 and a lecturer at the @entity97 , says the sale of @entity12 airport is a " priority " for the government and would boost the local economy			1
he told @entity0 : " it could provide space for tourism , housing or entertainment ... it 's a big , big scale investment			0
" @entity1 has valued its sell - able assets at 50 billion euros , with 55 % of it in real estate , including @entity12			1
@entity77 's most indebted nation has set a target to privatize 25 billion euros of these assets by 2020			2
proposals from foreign investors are first considered by a board of directors and overseen by representatives from @entity1 's international creditors , known as the " troika			1
" a shortlist is then drawn up and ultimately , the highest bidder wins			0
@entity1 prime minister @entity121 and his coalition government are hoping that privatization will increase competitiveness and make up for cuts in the public sector , particularly in jobs			0
could @entity1 's coveted islands be up for sale ? some eurozone politicians have advocated the country sell off more than just its infrastructure projects			1
@entity1 's islands , which draw tourist dollars and showcase the country 's beauty , have previously been flagged as potential investment gold			1
in october @entity138 , a @entity139 member of @entity140 and a member of chancellor @entity143 's coalition , told @entity144 himself said @entity1 is willing to sell its uninhabited islands			2
@entity147 ' office did not respond to the comment			0
but while the idea might seem unpalatable , @entity94 believes leasing the islands -- if such a program was properly managed and debated -- would n't be a bad idea			0
@entity94 noted shipping tycoon @entity153 had leased the island of @entity156 in the @entity157 , where he married @entity158 , previously the wife of @entity15 president @entity159			0
@entity94 added leases for islands " may last for 99 years and then possibly there is an option to renew , but investors do not own the island , so there is no issue of state sovereignty			0
" meanwhile , the @entity169 continues to try and draw investors into the country , soothing nervousness around the country 's two bailouts , a hefty debt restructuring and two elections .			0
