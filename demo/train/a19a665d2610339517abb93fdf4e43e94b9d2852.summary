-- the former leader of @entity3 may have to face international charges for alleged crimes committed during his time in office , president @entity1 announced wednesday , as he outlined his plans to bring peace and security to his nation			1
@entity1 told reporters that he was setting up a @entity13 , similar to those created after civil wars or conflicts in other countries , in order to bring to justice anyone who committed atrocities during the most recent strife or even before that			1
" reconciliation ca n't be done without justice , " @entity1 said in a news conference at the @entity24 , where he was holed up for months in the violent aftermath of the disputed presidential election			2
" all @entity29 are equal in the eyes of the law , no matter their politics , their origin , their religion or their race , " he said			0
former president @entity36 has been moved out of the @entity24 , where he was held after his arrest monday , and is now under guard in a villa elsewhere in the country , @entity1 said			1
" he is safe , and we will treat him with consideration , " the president said			0
" he is under house arrest in a villa			0
the president of the @entity47 , @entity48 ambassador @entity46 , said wednesday that @entity36 was taken to a presidential residence in the northern part of the country			1
" we must respect his rights as a former leader , and make sure that the consideration he deserves due to his former title is truly respected , and of course that his physical safety and health is also preserved , " @entity1 said			2
as for charges against @entity36 , that will be up to the @entity3 justice minister , @entity1 said , adding that international counts would be determined by an international prosecutor			1
the president also vowed that even members of the @entity68 -- the troops loyal to him -- who were found to have committed crimes would be brought to justice			2
" all the soldiers -- even those in the @entity68 -- identified as being pillagers will be dealt with , " the president said , in response to a journalist 's question about reports of @entity68 troops participating in raids and pillaging in @entity81			0
@entity85 published a scathing report saturday about abuses perpetrated by @entity89 forces on their offensive to @entity81			1
people interviewed by the monitoring agency " described how , in village after village , @entity89 forces summarily executed and raped perceived @entity36 supporters in their homes , as they worked in the fields , as they fled or as they tried to hide in the bush			1
" " @entity1 should fulfill his public pledge to investigate and prosecute abuses by both sides if @entity3 is to emerge from this horrific period , " said @entity99 , @entity100 director at @entity85			1
also under investigation is the massacre in the western @entity3 town of @entity108 , where the @entity109 said 800 people were slaughtered			1
the @entity111 blamed many of the deaths on @entity1 's forces			2
@entity1 said the minister of justice has already begun a probe into those killings , the @entity118 would be sending representatives in the next few days to look into the matter as well , and he has scheduled a meeting with the chief prosecutor for the @entity123			1
" i condemn this massacre , " @entity1 said wednesday			0
" the people responsible for these killings , whoever they are , will be judged			0
" " i am revolted , indignant at the number of dead , " he added			0
as many as 27,500 people took refuge after the massacre in a @entity133 mission in @entity108 , according to @entity134 , and humanitarian conditions there are deteriorating rapidly			0
" they are trapped in overcrowded and appalling conditions , having fled their homes after atrocious abuses were carried out by both parties to the conflict , " said @entity137 , @entity134 's deputy director for @entity100			0
the human rights group also warned that supporters of @entity36 in @entity81 and elsewhere were at risk of violent reprisals following the former president 's capture			1
one eyewitness reported to the group that a policeman belonging to @entity36 's ethnic group was taken from his home and shot dead at point blank range , an @entity134 statement said			1
" dozens of young people are going into hiding in @entity81 out of fear for their lives , " @entity137 said			0
" in the western part of the country , people suspected of being @entity162 are also terrified			0
many are hiding in the bush after their villages were burned down			0
they need to be protected			0
" on wednesday , the @entity168 said in a statement that rapes , sexual assaults , beatings and harassment of @entity3 women and girls by armed men had increased by " alarming numbers			1
" " women and girls are being brutally raped by armed men , often in front of their family members , " said @entity178 , an @entity168 women 's protection expert , who has been meeting with groups of @entity3 women and girls who fled to @entity183 in recent weeks to escape the violence in their homeland			1
" one woman told me she was forced to watch as several men took turns raping her sister , sometimes with a stick , and that she did n't survive the attack			2
" the refugee women who took part in @entity200 's group discussions said fear of rape or sexual slavery were the primary reasons they fled to @entity183 , according to the @entity168 statement			2
it provided no details on the identities or political ties of the armed men carrying out the assaults			1
@entity1 has blamed much of the bloodshed in the aftermath of the election on forces loyal to @entity36 , and said his government has begun a two - month program to root out weapons across the country			1
he 's also demanded that the militia members and mercenaries who worked for the former leader surrender their arms immediately			0
but he faces a daunting task in forging a peaceful and stable path forward			0
chief among his challenges , said longtime observers , will be to unite the severely divided nation and ensure justice for those who committed grave human rights violations in the nation 's political vacuum -- including those in his own camp who stand accused of heinous acts			1
most of the blame for the bloodshed rests squarely on the shoulders of @entity36 , whose refusal to cede power plunged @entity3 into crisis , said @entity244 of the @entity245 and a former @entity247 assistant secretary of state for african affairs under former president @entity248			1
the @entity123 in @entity249 , @entity250 , is now poised to investigate alleged war crimes instigated by @entity36			1
@entity1 will have to delicately balance such a probe with reconciliation			0
after all , said expert @entity254 , @entity1 did not win in a landslide			0
@entity36 won 45.9 percent of the vote and as such , @entity1 will have to reach out to his rival 's supporters , perhaps even welcome them into his government without jeopardizing justice , said @entity254 , head of the @entity100 program at the @entity262 think tank @entity263			1
but even more significant may be the way @entity1 handles his own dirt			0
though he emerged in the @entity267 media as the good versus @entity36 's evil , @entity1 , too , has been accused of having blood on his hands			1
in the @entity247 , @entity1 's critics questioned his right to rule			0
" it is now clear , based on @entity111 reports coming from @entity3 , that mass killings have occurred at the hands of @entity1 , " sen. @entity274 , @entity275 , said earlier this month			2
" this calls into question his legitimacy to lead that country , " said @entity274 , who has visited @entity3 nine times and made no secret of his support for @entity36			1
" @entity1 is on a rampage , killing innocent civilians , and he must be stopped before this becomes another @entity290			0
" human rights lawyer @entity291 said @entity1 's moment in the spotlight could quickly dim without adequate investigations into the abuse allegations against forces loyal to him			1
" mr. @entity1 should also be investigated because of the evidence that his troops did commit rapes and abuse en route to @entity81 , " said @entity291 , a former president of the @entity111 special court for @entity298			0
such a probe could answer questions about what amount of control @entity1 exerted over the forces fighting under his name and whether he deliberately failed to stop them , @entity291 said			0
in his favor , @entity1 has been viewed for some time as a hardworking man , an honest politician who favors transparency			0
he hailed from northern lands dominated by @entity315 immigrants who came to work in @entity3 and eventually grew into influential businessmen and traders			2
the @entity247 - educated @entity1 quit his @entity320 job to run for president in 2000 and might have met @entity36 on the ballot then , except that he was marked as an outsider -- his mother was from @entity325 -- and barred from participating in the election			2
the pro-gbagbo newspaper @entity327 accused @entity1 of backing a failed 2002 coup against @entity36 's government , which triggered the 2002 civil war			2
@entity1 's critics blame him for the deep split that @entity3 has yet to mend			2
@entity254 said the rebels who fought in the 2002 civil war , the @entity333 , formed a large part of the @entity89 forces fighting @entity36 's troops in the latest crisis			1
the @entity111 has repeatedly cited the armed group for breaking the arms embargo imposed on @entity3 , and human rights groups have sounded alarms about its abuses			1
the moral high ground in @entity3 , said @entity254 , is that the election result is clear and in favor of @entity1			2
" after that it gets gray and in the last few weeks , it 's gotten very opaque indeed , " he said about the recent spate of killings , especially the massacre in @entity108			0
@entity1 , said @entity291 , must conduct a swift inquiry into the allegations and punish the perpetrators			0
otherwise , @entity291 said , @entity1 will " himself be vulnerable to prosecution in the @entity249			0

new : sexual assaults by armed men increase , international agency says
the @entity123 is poised to investigate @entity36
human rights monitors accuse @entity89 forces of atrocities , as well
ensuring justice in @entity3 will be critical to its future , experts say
