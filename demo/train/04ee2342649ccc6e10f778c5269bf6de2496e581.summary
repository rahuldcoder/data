@entity0 -- a coalition of nearly 70 former federal prosecutors and judges has publicly opposed their former boss , the @entity7 government , in a dispute over prosecutorial misconduct			1
at issue is when defendants cleared of wrongdoing can sue the @entity13 for " bad faith " acts that taint the integrity of the judicial system			0
the @entity7 @entity18 has been asked to take up the appeal			1
a federal judge had awarded @entity21 nearly $ 602,000 in damages and fees after a jury acquitted the @entity26 doctor on charges relating to the fatal drug overdose of a patient			1
@entity21 later claimed two assistant @entity7 attorneys and a @entity32 agent " acted vexatiously " after the original indictment was filed			0
judge @entity34 concluded , among other things , prosecutors violated disclosure requirements by withholding information from the defendant and the court and by launching a separate " tactical " effort to disqualify the doctor 's attorney just before the trial was to begin			1
gold called the government 's conduct " profoundly disturbing , " raising " troubling issues about the integrity of those who wield enormous power over the people they prosecute			0
" a federal appeals court in @entity55 eventually threw out the lawsuit , saying the trial judge overreached , and that the overall prosecution and allegations on the original indictment were " objectively valid			1
" the @entity13 is now expected to ask the justices to dismiss the appeal			0
a federal law known as the @entity63 allows for damages , including attorney 's fees , when a court determines the entire government 's " position of the @entity7 was vexatious , frivolous , or in bad faith			2
" the narrow scope of the law has made it generally difficult for defendants to recoup the costs of botched federal criminal prosecutions by the government			0
but the group of onetime prosecutors and judges opposing the government on thursday filed a so - called " amicus " legal brief backing the doctor , saying in this case the damages award was appropriate			2
" the amici are deeply concerned that the @entity89 's decision will allow serious prosecutorial misconduct to be excused and , in so doing , will undermine public confidence in our system of justice , " said attorney @entity85 , representing the legal coalition			2
" if allowed to stand , the [ appeals court 's ] holding will disempower district judges , and send a clear signal that even grave prosecutorial misconduct will generally be overlooked , given the relatively lax standards for instituting federal prosecutions , " he added			1
it is somewhat unusual for this large a group of onetime federal prosecutors and judges to come together and strongly oppose the @entity13 's actions in a criminal case			1
@entity21 is also being supported by other groups , including the @entity109 and the @entity110			0
the @entity112 administration has not yet formally reacted to the original appeal by @entity21 or the supporting parties			0
government appellate lawyers have until september 10 to file their official response .			0
