a @entity1 report delivered a scathing indictment tuesday of torture policies that officially ended when president @entity4 came into office , but another holdover from the @entity8 - era war on terrorism is keeping @entity4 tethered to the previous administration			0
nearly six years after @entity4 signed an executive order on his third day in office to begin the process of shutting down the @entity15 in @entity16 , 136 prisoners remain in military custody on the @entity19 naval base , despite the release of six more prisoners just this week			1
about 100 have been released since 2009			0
@entity4 may have ended the @entity23 's torture program , but his administration has yet to come close to shutting down @entity15 , which has become an international symbol of @entity19 abuses in the post- 9/11 war on terror			1
and the torture report 's release prompted a nearly 13 - year detainee of the notorious prison to recount the severe mistreatment he endured , writing in a @entity35 column that the report is " just the start of what @entity19 have to accept happened in their name			1
" @entity40 , a @entity41 man accused of serving in @entity43 's security detail , described conditions at @entity15 that included the repeated , seemingly incessant interrogations he faced at the hands of @entity19 officials			1
also on this story : my treatment shames @entity19 flag the abuses alleged by the prisoner are similar to those outlined in the @entity1 report , which focused on the interrogations of detainees held in secret overseas facilities in the years after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on @entity60 and @entity61			1
@entity62 listed sleep deprivation , humiliation and beatings -- abuses similar to those described as " tantamount to torture " in a 2004 @entity70 report leaked to the @entity71			0
@entity62 also described the painful force - feeding he has been subjected to as he and as many as 100 other prisoners have engaged in hunger strikes to protest their continued detention without charge			2
@entity35 could not independently verify the claims made in @entity62 's editorial piece			0
when contacted by @entity35 , the @entity79 said it would not comment on individual claims such as @entity62 's			0
the abuses asserted by @entity62 were also suffered by other detainees at @entity15 , said @entity83 , an attorney who has represented @entity15 detainees in two cases that went before the @entity19 @entity86			1
" cold cells , uncomfortable positions , beating them up , making them pee in their pants , the sexual taunting -- it was all within the range of what was done to many of them , " said @entity83 , who represented 12 @entity87 detained in @entity15 from 2002 to 2004			2
@entity99 his clients also spoke of the pornography room that @entity62 mentions in his column , @entity83 said			0
@entity62 said he was forced to view pornographic images of women and men , as his interrogators stripped him of his clothes			0
" i 've heard worse			0
i 've heard that they had women come in and touch them , which for @entity111 men is a terrible thing , " said @entity83 , who has visited @entity15 14 times			2
an international human rights legal group representing @entity115 and several other @entity15 detainees contends that the abuses were common			1
" almost every one of my clients has reported identical treatment to what @entity40 details in this piece , " said @entity118 , counterterrorism counsel for @entity119 , an international human rights nongovernmental organization headquartered in @entity120			0
@entity119 represents a total of 10 @entity15 detainees , including nationals from @entity41 , @entity129 , @entity130 and the @entity131 , @entity118 said			2
@entity118 , however , was n't involved in the preparation of @entity62 's op - ed , which is written in @entity62 's words , she said			2
some of the abuses continue , @entity118 charged			0
" they are still in freezing cells , they still have problems with food , and they are still being treated roughly or hit by the guards , " she said			0
" recently , this past summer , ( the detainees ) had incredibly invasive genital searches " whenever they left their cells to receive a phone call or meet with their attorneys , said @entity118 , who has visited @entity15 three times			2
" some of them felt they were being penetrated , " she said of the searches			0
" it 's just that the torture continues in different forms , but as long as the government applies this secrecy to @entity15 , we wo n't find out until years after the fact			1
" @entity15 : what happens when detainees held for years get out ? @entity15 detainees -- of which there have been nearly 800 -- were allegedly tortured at the site , drawing widespread international condemnation from human rights and civil liberties advocates who decried the interrogation techniques and the @entity19 authority to detain the suspected terrorists without charges			1
nearly all @entity15 prisoners are being held without charges , and while about half of those are considered high - level threat detainees , the remainder were determined to be low - level threats by a task force of top @entity19 intelligence and law enforcement agencies			1
those in the latter group could gain their freedom , provided security conditions could first be met in their host countries			0
security concerns have set back and stalled the shuttering of the notorious facility , and the release of @entity15 prisoners has drummed up serious opposition in @entity193 on both sides of the aisle			1
in december 2010 , @entity193 amended the annual defense budget bill to prevent the transfer of any @entity15 detainees to the @entity19			1
that defeated the @entity4 administration 's plans announced a year earlier to try several @entity15 detainees involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks in @entity19 federal court			1
among those , @entity205 , a mastermind of the 2001 @entity207 attacks , was slated to be flown to @entity60 to face trial in federal court			0
@entity210 the 2010 legislation also banned @entity4 from using federal funds to build a detention facility to house the @entity15 detainees on @entity19 soil under existing authority			1
@entity19 officials have defended the indefinite detention of suspected terrorists without trial or charges as legitimate under laws of war , saying that @entity223 against @entity224 allows the @entity19 to detain those enemy combatants until the fight against @entity224 -- and associated groups like @entity210 -- ends			2
it is of course unclear when that fight could or would reach an official conclusion			0
but members of @entity193 continue to oppose the release of @entity15 detainees -- even those considered low - level threats -- because of the risk that they could engage in terrorism against the @entity19			1
about 17 % of the total of 620 detainees released from @entity15 -- most during president @entity8 's presidency -- have since engaged in terrorist activities , according to the september 2014 semiannual report from the director of national intelligence			1
another 12 % are suspected of engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities			0
even if all the detainees recommended for release by the interagency task force are transferred out of @entity15 , about 69 detainees would remain , according to the @entity71			2
" so we 're stuck with @entity15 , " @entity118 said			2
" now , we 're in a hole			0
" i tend to be a pessimist about it			0
no matter what the president continues to say , i do n't think this is his priority anymore , " she added			0
those detainees include @entity205 and a handful of others slated for trial under the military commission system , as well as dozens who are considered serious high - level threats but could not be tried and convicted -- and that legal limbo is the ultimate conundrum @entity4 faces as he looks to make good on a long - overdue campaign promise to close the facility before his term ends			1
and while just four @entity15 detainees were released under @entity271 's 2011 - 2013 tenure as defense secretary , @entity4 renewed his commitment to closing the prison in 2013			1
since then , 30 prisoners have been transferred to other countries under secretary of defense @entity278 's tenure , the @entity71 reported			2
those included five mid- to high - level @entity282 militants who were released from @entity15 this spring in exchange for the release of @entity286 sgt. @entity285 , who was being held by @entity282 forces in @entity288			1
and the specter of @entity210 has stoked more fears in @entity61 that former detainees could attack the @entity19 or @entity19 abroad if freed			2
case in point : the @entity19 military released @entity295 , who was captured in 2004 and held at @entity296 , a @entity19 - run prison in @entity297			1
he was released later that year			0
he went on to become the leader of @entity210 and is the self - declared caliph of the so - called @entity300 .			0

the @entity19 needs to find a *destination* for @entity15 's 136 prisoners to shutter facility
about half of the detainees held without charges are considered high - level threats
security concerns and a ban on bringing detainees onto @entity19 soil have stalled the closure
