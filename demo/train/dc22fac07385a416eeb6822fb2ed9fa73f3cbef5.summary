-- it seems like the opposite of what you 'd expect , but my cancer diagnosis -- a staggering @entity8 colon cancer diagnosis , delivered to me at the age of 28 -- gave me a new lease on life			1
it has changed me , and enriched my life , in ways that i never could have imagined			2
even in the moment i learned of my diagnosis , and the grim prognosis that followed , i was n't afraid			2
i did n't feel sorry for myself , and i was n't angry			2
i was ready to fight this disease head - on and show myself -- and everyone else -- what i was made of			1
i believed that my will to survive , to thrive , to love and laugh and enjoy my life -- would carry me through any physical challenge			0
forty - six rounds of chemo ( and counting ) , three surgeries , 10 rounds of radiation , and here i am			1
and i will continue to fight until cancer gives up , because there 's no way i will			1
my fighting and competitive spirit has served me well , but my ability to be open to learning has been equally valuable			0
throughout my time battling cancer , i have learned so much about taking care of my body , mind , and spirit			1
just months after my diagnosis , i made the jump to strict veganism			0
i drink green juice , not alcohol			0
i manage stress levels and i make sure i always get enough sleep			0
i 've done acupuncture , reiki and guided meditation			0
i smile and laugh and listen to great music and appreciate beautiful things			0
i soak in my life and i am constantly grateful			0
becoming sick was the way i learned how to be well			0
' on looking ' : the world you 're not seeing by far , the best part of my cancer - killing adventures has been becoming a part of a community of cancer warriors and their loved ones			1
my fellow patients are more than just friends			0
they are my brothers and sisters in this fight			1
when they do well through treatment , i celebrate with them			0
and when they struggle -- or die -- i am just as upset about it as if they were a part of my family			0
that 's because they are			0
my best friend in the cancer world , a fellow warrior and a phenomenal woman named @entity87 , passed away at the end of last year			1
losing her has been one of the most difficult things i 've ever had to endure			0
but her fighting and undefeatable spirit , and my desire to honor her , have helped fuel the fire in my belly			0
it has helped me push forward with my mission : my mission for the cure			1
a simple but revolutionary initiative that sees every penny donated going to cutting - edge research that i hope will get us to the cure for colon cancer in under 10 years			1
it sounds crazy , right ? the cure			1
and i 'm betting my life on it			0
several months ago , i asked my doctor -- a world - renowned oncologist and researcher at @entity116 named @entity118 - @entity117 -- a series of simple questions			2
if you had all the money in the world , could you cure colon cancer ? do you know what steps to take to cure the disease ? is money the only thing standing in the way of the cure ? the answer to all of those questions was an emphatic yes			1
@entity117 and his dream team -- scientists and researchers from the @entity137 and abroad -- are sure that they can find the cure for colon cancer if they have the funds to do the necessary large - scale research and drug development that the team has long been known for			1
@entity145 frontman : i 'm deaf in one ear it 's my job , and my mission , to lead the movement to raise those funds so they can do their work			1
it 's my job to start something unprecedented , a global uprising against cancer , focused solely on supporting the groundbreaking research necessary to change the face of cancer forever -- for all of us			2
the goal of @entity102 is to raise $ 250 million in two years			1
through that funding , we hope to have the cure in under 10 years			2
it sounds like an impossible goal -- to find the cure for cancer -- but it is possible			1
it is within our grasp			0
and i will make sure that we seize this opportunity			0
for @entity87 , for myself , and for my fellow cancer warriors			2
from the moment i was diagnosed , i knew it was n't the end of the line for me			2
i think that i always knew , deep down , that it was the end of the line for cancer			2
and through @entity102 , i know it will be .			1
