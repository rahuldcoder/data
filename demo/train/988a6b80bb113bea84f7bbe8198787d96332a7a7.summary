-- prom night sends most teen girls on a dizzying quest for the perfect dress , accessories and hairstyle to make their ensemble complete			2
on her prom night , @entity9 was harried by one simple detail : " i just wanted eyebrows for my prom pictures			2
" when she was just a baby , @entity9 was diagnosed with alopecia totalis , an autoimmune disease that results in the total loss of scalp hair			1
by her 1st birthday , she 'd lost all of her hair			1
" i was like @entity25 , " says @entity21 , now 33 and living in @entity23 , @entity24			2
it can occur in men and women at any age and is a strictly physical disease , but sufferers say it 's also a disease of the spirit , exacting a devastating emotional toll in this world of silky shampoo commercials and @entity39 fairy tales			1
for those who experience it , particularly women who often self - identify with the color and style of their locks , it 's about learning to manage the disease and not be defined by it			1
they choose a way to self - present : wig , no wig , clean shaven or a little of each			2
@entity21 ventured into wearing wigs in kindergarten as the childish innocence of her peers grew more inquisitive and uncensored			1
she continued to do so throughout junior high			2
at the time , the wigs available were " very obvious , " she says			1
before then , being bald never seemed taboo ; it was her normal			2
then came sleepover age : a girl insisted @entity21 put a housecoat over the pillow where she would rest her head			2
to that girl , baldness was gross			2
in those years , @entity9 says she became more shy and hyperaware about what made her different			2
i would wish that my hair would grow back , " @entity9 says			1
in high school , when she realized people might make fun of her anyway , she took one a giant leap toward self - awareness : she decided to ditch the hairpiece and embrace the beauty of bald			2
brave middle schooler tells peers she 's bald " i thought , ' let them make fun of somebody with a medical condition , let 's see what happens , ' " she says			2
the response was mature : people backed off and even stood up for her			0
learning to value yourself and not your hair according to the @entity94 , a big part of the coping process is about " learning to value yourself for who you are , not for how much hair you have or do n't have			1
" @entity99 is a psychology lecturer at @entity100 in @entity101 , and has extensively researched the psychological toll of the disease , including co-authoring the book , " coping with @entity26			1
" " @entity26 , for whatever reason , is associated firstly with aging and secondly with illness , " @entity99 said in an e-mail			1
" so society is automatically shocked or fearful of this			0
" @entity99 's co-researcher and husband , @entity113 , has alopecia universalis , the rarest form of the disease , one that results in total loss of body hair			1
( the most common form of alopecia is alopecia areata , which causes the hair to fall out in patches			1
) when @entity99 found there was hardly any psychological research done on the disease , they dug in			0
" it opened up a floodgate of responses and many said that they felt no one had been listening to them for years , " she says			0
it was no longer just a physical diagnosis			1
she says their research found that there was a perception from both sexes that it was worse for women ; that it seemed more acceptable for men to appear bald			1
however , both men and women with alopecia are n't opting to go bald -- " it is forced upon them , so in that way , they respond to it very much in the same way , " she says			1
those who are balding or are born with a hairless pate can experience embarrassment , hopelessness , hastiness for a " quick fix , " and , if a wig wearer , the fear that others might find out that their hair actually is n't their own			1
she found a man who did n't care about hair for @entity163 , 29 , that feeling came to a head on a first date in high school			1
after a few previous dates did n't handle her diagnosis so well , she decided to lay it all out on the table that very first night , warning him that she had something to confess			1
" ' if you want to walk out the door , that 's ok , ' " she remembers saying			0
" oh thank @entity178 , " her date responded			0
" that 's it ? ! " @entity180 , of @entity181 , @entity182 , has been married to the man to whom she made that first - date confession for five years			0
@entity180 , like @entity21 , received a diagnosis early on in life -- at 3 -- but did n't see more serious aspects of the disease , especially psychologically , until her senior year in high school			1
" i did n't think anything of it , " she says			0
seeing a bald woman was n't out of her realm of experience ; her grandmother was going through chemotherapy at the same time			0
as her hairline changed rapidly in her teen years , she sought solace in scrunchies and scarves			1
when those no longer did the job , she and her mom went wig shopping			0
her friends at the time started to call her " @entity212 " and tugged at her hair			1
she admits feeling like she would never get married and never have kids			0
now , she has both -- and an unforeseen career as a hairdresser			0
" i always had a creative eye for hair ; i was always creative in hiding my bald spots , " says @entity180 , who wears a wig every day , calling it " an accessory			1
" for other women , @entity180 has become an unlikely ally			1
she recounts how a woman came in heartbroken as the effects of chemotherapy laid her scalp bare			0
@entity180 took her wig off and showed her true self ; they wept together and talked through the change			0
" it 's just hair , " she remembers saying			1
' for me to walk out bald , it 's so hard ' @entity239 , 30 , of @entity240 is in a more transitional period -- often forgoing the wigs that were her safety blankets for more than 20 years			1
" i love who i am , but at the same time , for me to walk out bald , it 's so hard because there 's so much trauma growing up , " she says , recalling jabs such as " baldy " throughout her teenage years			0
with the new hairless territory , she says she had to adapt to the occasional awkward moment of a stranger approaching her because they think she 's sick			0
" you 're healthy ! there 's nothing wrong with you , but society still has to look at you			0
it 's so hard to hear there 's nothing wrong with you			0
the mentality of it is still a mental battle			0
it 's really tricky , " she says			0
unlike @entity21 and @entity180 , who were too young at the time of their diagnosis to comprehend the condition , @entity239 did n't receive her diagnosis until adolescence			1
" from the date that i found my first bald spot ( at age 9 ) until i was 17 , i had a really big hatred for the word ' alopecia ' and everything that it put me through , " she says			1
@entity239 now operates @entity280 , a mobile wig boutique specifically geared toward women who are coping with hair loss			1
her epiphany : she 's lived with this every single day and knows first - hand what people in the same situation need			0
" i wish at 9 years old i had known that it was ok			0
... everyone is dealt something they have to struggle with , " @entity239 says			0
" now , i know it is n't the worst thing that could happen to me			0
" but there 's always work to do			0
@entity21 calls those less - than - pretty - feeling days , as all people have , " an alopecia day			2
" there are also upsides : " people will always remember you , and you can use that as an advantage , " she says			0
she has met a network of women through organizations such as the @entity308 ( @entity21 attends its annual conference every year ) and social media , which has helped her adjust			2
when they get together , their lack of hair is n't the glaring beacon it is to others			2
" i 'm not just @entity9 the bald girl			0
i 'm @entity9 the marketing major			0
i 'm @entity9 from @entity24 , " @entity9 says .			0

@entity26 physically affects the hair *follicles* , but the emotional toll is often *overlooked*
many women with alopecia opt to wear wigs , hats or scarves on a daily basis
when and how to share an alopecia diagnosis with loved ones can be *stressful*
