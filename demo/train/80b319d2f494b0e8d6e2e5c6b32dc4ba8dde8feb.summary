@entity0 -- scandal is threatening to eclipse the poignancy and pageantry of @entity5 's historic final days as pope			1
@entity8 officials were already trying monday to swat down unsavory claims by @entity11 publications of a brewing episode involving gay priests , male prostitutes and blackmail when news broke that @entity5 had moved up the resignation of a @entity19 archbishop linked over the weekend by a @entity21 newspaper to inappropriate relationships with priests			1
@entity5 announced two weeks ago that he will step down as pope thursday , becoming the first pontiff to leave the job alive in 598 years			1
interactive : where does the pope live ? at 85 , he said he was too old , frail and tired to continue on as spiritual leader of the @entity31 and its 1.2 billion followers worldwide			2
it was a stunningly unexpected announcement that left church scholars poring over @entity36 law to answer such basic questions as when the pope 's successor would be chosen and even what he would be called in retirement			1
but the scandals -- along with lingering questions about how the church has handled claims of abuse by catholic priests around the world -- have dimmed the spotlight on @entity5 's final days as pope			1
" clearly , prior to these scandals erupting , the cardinals had a long checklist of things they were looking for in terms of the new pope , " @entity1 senior @entity52 analyst @entity51 said monday , including finding someone to help spread the message of the church and inspire faith amid flagging practice of the catholic faith in many parts of the world			2
" but in the wake of everything that 's happened in the last 72 hours or so , quite clearly a new item is on that list , which is they also want to make sure they pick somebody who 's got clean hands , " @entity51 said			0
@entity52 reveals pope @entity5 's new title archbishop 's resignation the @entity52 confirmed monday that @entity5 had accelerated the resignation of cardinal @entity79 , the archbishop of @entity19			1
@entity79 told the pope in november that he would resign effective with his 75th birthday , on march 17			1
but @entity5 decided to make the resignation effective immediately in light of the pope 's imminent resignation , the @entity82 said			1
the announcement comes a day after a sunday report by the @entity21 newspaper @entity89 that three priests and one former priest leveled allegations against @entity79 that date back 30 years			1
the @entity89 did not recount details of the claims or identify any of @entity79 's accusers , but said one of the priests alleged " that the cardinal developed an inappropriate relationship with him			1
" @entity79 did not attend @entity100 at @entity101 in @entity102 on sunday , but the @entity82 told @entity1 that the cardinal " contests these claims and is taking legal advice			2
" his accusers took their complaints to the @entity52 representative in @entity21 and demanded @entity79 's resignation , @entity89 reported			1
at the @entity52 , the rev. @entity110 , a spokesman for the church , told reporters that @entity5 has been informed of the allegations			2
as late as last week , @entity79 appeared to be making plans to take part in the conclave , when the @entity117 gathers in @entity0 to pick a successor to @entity5			1
but in a statement in which he thanked @entity120 for the good he was able to do and apologized to " all whom i have offended , " @entity79 said monday that he would not be part of that gathering			2
" i do not wish media attention in @entity0 to be focused on me -- but rather on pope @entity5 and on his successor , " @entity79 said			1
opinion : ' @entity128 ' behind pope 's resignation ? not likely cardinal controversy while @entity79 will no longer be involved in electing the new pope , another controversial cardinal 's plan to attend is further taking focus from @entity5 's final days in office			1
cardinal @entity137 of @entity138 is facing fresh attention for his role in the cover - up of sexual abuse by priests			0
documents recently released as part of the 2007 settlement in a previous abuse case detail what @entity148 , founder of the watchdog group @entity149 says is " stark " evidence of efforts by @entity153 and others to sidestep authorities investigating sexual abuse			0
he recently gave a deposition in a 2010 civil lawsuit filed in the @entity158 by a @entity160 citizen suing the @entity138 archdiocese			0
the man alleges @entity137 and a @entity160 cardinal conspired to allow a priest accused of abuse to flee to @entity160 , putting an untold number of children at risk			2
@entity137 has denied the allegations			0
two groups seeking to stop @entity137 's participation in the election said saturday they have collected nearly 10,000 signatures on a petition against his involvement			0
" his participation in the conclave would only bring clouds of shame at a time that should bring springs of hope , " said @entity176 , the communications director for one of the groups , @entity179			0
@entity187 also worked on the campaign			0
church law requires that @entity137 attend , the @entity189 said			0
father @entity191 , an @entity192 priest who studies the @entity52 , said it would be impossible to exclude every cardinal with a hand in the church 's vast sex - abuse problem			2
" unfortunately , if you were going to tell me no one can go to the conclave who has part in any type of cover up , you would probably exclude every cardinal in the church , because unfortunately that 's the way the church is operated , " he said			0
blackmail allegations as if the controversies over @entity79 and @entity137 were not enough , two @entity11 publications reported over the weekend that @entity5 had decided to resign not because of age , but because of a brewing scandal over the blackmail of gay priests by male prostitutes in @entity0			1
@entity5 received a 300 - page report in december detailing the possible blackmail , @entity220 newspaper and the @entity222 news weekly reported , citing an unidentified senior @entity52 official and dozens of unnamed sources			1
the @entity52 emphatically denied the allegations this weekend , with secretary of state @entity226 criticizing a rash of " often unverified , unverifiable or completely false news stories " as the cardinals prepare for their conclave			0
cardinal @entity231 , one of the men who will help elect @entity5 's successor , called the claims " guesswork and imagination			1
" " there is no proof and these allegations only serve to create a climate of division that helps no one , " he said			0
while no one outside the @entity8 has seen the document that purportedly details the claims and @entity8 officials have not confirmed it exists , @entity51 said such a claim is not improbable			2
" to me that passes the smell test , " he said			0
retirement preparations amid the scandal , the @entity52 still has a transfer of power to manage			1
on monday , @entity110 said it remains unclear when the gathering of church leaders who will elect the next pope will begin			0
while @entity5 issued an order monday to allow the election to begin sooner than the 15 days after the seat becomes vacant mandated by church rules , the date for the election will be set by the cardinals when they first gather , monsignor pier @entity258 said monday at a @entity8 press briefing			1
it still must happen within 20 days of his resignation , the pope said			0
after his retirement , @entity5 is expected to head to the pope 's summer residence in @entity0 before eventually settling in a monastery in @entity8			1
church officials have said he will seek no influence over the election of his successor , or over management of the church			0
among other issues , @entity52 officials are still trying to work out what @entity5 will be called in retirement			2
one suggestion is " pontifex maximus , " @entity258 said			0
the term can be translated as " supreme bishop			0
" @entity52 officials hope to have an answer next week , @entity110 said			0
@entity289 reported from @entity0 ; @entity290 reported and wrote from @entity291			0
@entity1 's @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report			2
