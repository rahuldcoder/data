during the 2004 presidential election , i spent time near @entity3 , @entity4 , trying to turn out votes for @entity6			0
i visited neighborhoods around the struggling @entity9 town , knocking on doors and repeating a campaign - prepared script about senator @entity6 's plans to put the middle class back on track			0
the voters scoffed at me , surveying their decaying porches with the decaying economy all around them			0
they blamed trade deals , especially the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) for the loss of good manufacturing jobs in the area , and laws giving steel and auto plants the chance to move jobs overseas			1
one after another , each voter reminded me that both parties supported the crappy @entity20 deal that got us into this mess			2
how could we trust any of them to get us out ? a decade later , just after the 20th anniversary of @entity20 , president @entity36 is marking the disastrous legacy of free trade policies by working with republicans to push for even more bad trade deals that would benefit big businesses at the expense of @entity45 's economy and workers			1
president @entity36 has outlined an ambitious agenda to help the middle class			0
but his eagerness to find some area of compromise with @entity52 in the form of trade policy risks undermining all his other plans			0
" i 'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect @entity45 workers , with strong new trade deals from @entity64 to @entity65 that are n't just free , but fair , " president @entity36 said in his @entity57 on tuesday night as @entity52 stood and applauded while @entity58 rightly stayed in their seats			1
trade promotion authority is a new synonym for " fast - track authority " which would give the president authority to negotiate international trade agreements on his own			2
@entity71 could veto such deals , but could not amend or filibuster them			0
fast - track trade authority removes important checks and balances not only in our legislative process but in our economy as a whole			1
this is a bad idea for two reasons			0
in recent history , trade deals enacted by @entity83 have been bad for @entity45 workers and our economy			1
president @entity36 and @entity52 promote trade deals as good for economic growth and job creation			1
" ninety - five percent of the world 's customers live outside our borders , and we ca n't close ourselves off from those opportunities , " president @entity36 said			0
however , government data analyzed by the nonprofit @entity95 shows that under two decades of fast - track trade agreements , @entity45 trade deficits have gotten worse -- increasing by over 440 %			1
nearly 5 million @entity45 jobs -- 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs in @entity45 -- have been lost since fast - track deals like @entity20 and related agreements			1
while president @entity36 has emphasized that he wants to reduce income inequality , numerous studies say such trade deals have contributed to the rise in income inequality			1
in fact , wages in the @entity45 have remained mostly stagnant , adjusted for inflation , since the mid- 1970s â€” when fast - track trade authority was first enacted -- even though worker productivity has doubled in the same period			1
all of this suggests we need more scrutiny on these trade deals , not less			2
given the evidence of the destruction of previous trade deals , we need giant caution signs , speed bumps and roadblocks -- not a fast track			1
the other problem with fast - track trade authority is that it allows our trade negotiators to unilaterally undermine democratically passed legislation			1
for instance , the @entity126 , an 11 - nation deal championed by both president @entity36 and top @entity52 in @entity71 , is not really about trade			2
of the partnership 's 29 chapters , only five address trade issues			0
the other chapters do things like create new monopoly patent extensions for pharmaceutical companies that would raise medicine prices for average @entity45 , and create a right for foreign firms to import food to the @entity45 exempt from our current food safety standards			0
the @entity126 would even restrict certain " buy local " and " buy @entity45 " initiatives -- in other words , preventing @entity45 consumers from protesting the trade deal with their own votes and wallets			2
i should add that this is what watchdogs think is in the @entity126 deal -- because of document leaks			0
we do n't know for sure , because while 600 private corporations have been involved in negotiating the terms of the trade deal behind closed doors , even @entity71 wo n't get to see the terms of the deal until after it 's signed			0
that 's why many democrats oppose the deal , and similarly disastrous trade deals like it			2
if more crummy job - killing trade bills are what comes from bipartisanship , i would rather take more bitter acrimony .			0

@entity45 workers blame trade deals like @entity20 for the loss of good manufacturing jobs
@entity177 : @entity36 wants " fast track " trade authority , which would remove important checks and balances
fast track would benefit big businesses at the expense of workers and our economy
