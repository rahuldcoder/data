@entity0 , @entity1 -- many of @entity5 's rape survivors took to the streets sunday to speak out against sexual violence in a country where it has become a weapon of war			1
" my heart is in pain , why are you raping me ? " sang the rape victims , many of whom left hospital beds to join the march in eastern @entity5			1
" they have had enough , enough , enough , enough , " said @entity20 , a @entity1 women 's activist , of the women marching			0
" enough of the war , of the rape , of nobody paying attention to what 's happening to them			1
" the @entity30 has named the @entity1 the " rape capital of the world , " with 15,000 women raped in eastern @entity5 last year			1
the attacks occurred in parts of the country where armed rebel groups moved into areas considered to be pro-government but lacking in army or police protection , according to the @entity30 @entity41 , the @entity30 secretary - general 's special representative on sexual violence in conflict , said recently that one distraught @entity1 woman had told her that " a dead rat is worth more than the body of a woman			0
" " it was an expression of how human rights violations against women are still the lowest on a fool 's hierarchy of war time horrors , " she said			2
sunday 's march was organized by the @entity56 in association with local women 's groups			2
organizers hoped the march would combat the stigma attached to rape victims and draw international attention to the problem of rape as a war tactic			1
" it 's just great to have so many women out on the streets , " said @entity68 , a representative from @entity56			0
" we believe that women should not be made prisoners in their own homes			0
" among throngs of marchers , many clad in bright traditional garb and carrying homemade signs , one @entity1 marcher echoed that sentiment			0
" i tell you , it 's a wonderful thing to see all the women together , just for one reason -- for the peace of the women of @entity5 , " said @entity87			1
" this is the freedom of the @entity5 women			1
" last month , a @entity30 report slammed @entity5 's security forces for failing to prevent a wave of mass rapes over several days during the summer			2
the preliminary report confirms the rape of at least 303 civilians between july 30 and august 2 in the @entity100 region of @entity5 's @entity101			1
the report points to serious shortcomings in the preparedness and response of the local detachments of the @entity1 army and the police stationed in the area			0
it also notes that their failure to prevent or stop the attacks was compounded by subsequent failings on the part of @entity30 stabilization mission forces in @entity5			2
the report said the force had not received any specific training in the protection of civilians , and suffered from a number of operational constraints , including a limited capacity to gather information , as well as the lack of a telecommunications system in the area			0
" the scale and viciousness of these mass rapes defy belief , " said @entity130 @entity129			0
" even in the eastern part of @entity1 where rape has been a perennial and massive problem for the past 15 years , this incident stands out , " @entity129 said , " because of the extraordinarily cold - blooded and systematic way in which it appears to have been planned and executed			0
