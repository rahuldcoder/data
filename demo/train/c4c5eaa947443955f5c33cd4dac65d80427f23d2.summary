-- i clung white - knuckled to the back of my friend 's motorbike as the two of us zipped around the streets of @entity8			1
we buzzed past a man sitting in a barber 's chair on the sidewalk of a main road			1
the man was peering into an oval mirror tacked to a tree as the barber clipped away			2
" see ! @entity19 ! " my friend said			2
" what ? " i asked , trying to figure out what i had seen as much as what he just said			0
" @entity24 , " he repeated			0
" it was the first day of my 11 - day tour through northern and central @entity25 , and the adventure had just begun			1
@entity25 was never at the top of my list of places to visit -- that is until my old roommate from @entity34 took a job in @entity8			1
when my rock - climbing partner , with a level of sanity as questionable as my own , found out climbing was on our itinerary , he decided to join in			1
we 'd start in @entity8 and take in the city sights , make our way to @entity45 for a little climbing and finally to @entity47 along the central coast for some relaxation			1
@entity8 at street level we flew in to the capital , where traffic signals and street signs , if they exist , seem more like suggestions than law			1
the streets are the heart and soul of @entity8			1
they 're where people gather for everything from dinner to shoe repair , and the only way to take in the city is to plunge into the traffic			0
so we did , starting with a walking tour of the @entity70			0
roughly 1,000 years old , the @entity70 developed as craftsmen gathered around the old palace to peddle their wares			0
the narrow streets eventually became the central marketplace and business area , but it retains much of its ancient charm			0
the buildings are only a few stories tall , narrow and deep , and artisans and merchants still line the sidewalks			0
the streets are named after what you may find on them -- tinwork on @entity89 and silk on @entity91			0
@entity92 was once home to fragrant oil merchants , but now tourists and locals walk the street looking for a great deal on shoes			1
after watching a tinsmith melt and mold what appeared to be a sprinkler head , another wonder of the @entity8 streets caught my eye , or rather my taste buds			1
on the balcony of a coffee shop near the @entity70 , i had my first sip of @entity112 -- @entity25 iced coffee			1
it is dark and thick like espresso , but served iced and creamed with a couple of spoonfuls of sweetened condensed milk			0
i was addicted at first sip			0
climbing on @entity45 one taxi , three buses and a speedboat away from @entity8 we found the small island of @entity45 in @entity125			1
@entity125 was named one of the @entity127 in 2011 and is easily recognized by the hundreds of limestone karsts that jut sharply out of the turquoise waters			1
where much of the area has watered down the wilderness experience to cater to tourists , @entity45 attracts a more low - maintenance traveler -- the " @entity135 ´			1
" " it means ' @entity139 backpacker , ' " my friend explained			1
" but it also means they think you 're cheap			1
" @entity45 is a popular spot for backpackers from all over the world who have developed a reputation for their stinginess			1
accommodations are basic , and prices are low			0
tall , narrow hotels line the main road , each with an amazing view of the harbor			0
rooms go for dollars a day , and the cafes feature fresh seafood on the cheap			0
but the real draw of the island is away from the main drag , so our first morning we caught a ride on a tourist boat to a beachside climbing site			1
as we meandered through the waters of the bay , a unique nautical culture revealed itself			0
because the land is often too rocky to cultivate but the bay is rich in sea life , locals have made the water their home			0
large networks of floating villages hide in the shadows of the karsts			0
brightly colored huts are built on grids of floating barrels and beams with frontyards made of fishing nets			0
our boat dropped anchor off the shore of a deserted beach			0
we loaded our climbing gear onto kayaks and paddled over			2
we scaled the jagged walls of @entity194 and @entity196 's beaches in solitude , taking in the beauty of @entity125 from the top of the vertical cliffs			1
in addition to experiencing the bay 's natural beauty , you ca n't help but stumble upon history			1
we explored the island during a break between climbing routes and found a natural cave with a man - made concrete slab for a floor , most likely created as a hideout during the @entity214 ( or the @entity214 , as it 's known in @entity25 )			1
although i never discovered the history of that exact cave , back on @entity45 we toured another war - era relic with a local guide			1
@entity220 is a three story , bomb - proof structure built into a natural cave			2
it was a hospital and a safe house for the @entity226 during the war , complete with a kitchen , surgical rooms and a theater			0
we also traded $ 8 cash for two motorbikes ( no rental agreement required ) and sped up the windy , lush road to @entity235			0
@entity235 was built in the 1940s and later used during the war			0
two cannons remain hidden in its crevices , and it 's a spectacular place to take in a sunset			2
high class in @entity47 after braving the traffic in the city and the cliffs ( and jellyfish ) of the bay , i deemed the last part of our trip as @entity252 time , and the ancient city of @entity47 did not disappoint			2
most port cities in @entity25 have met one of two fates : they have either grown into large industrial harbors such as @entity258 or shriveled over time			1
its narrow streets with lantern - lit storefronts and a fusion of various styles of traditional @entity264 architecture give it a quaint feel			2
two of the city 's specialties are clothing and food			2
the first you can get made to order			0
the second you can make yourself			0
every other storefront in the old town is a tailor 's shop where you can design your own clothing , pick the fabrics and have it sewn overnight			2
if you find the right tailor , you can walk away with quality , high - style clothing made to fit at big - box store prices			2
as for the food , @entity47 is a unique blend of northern and southern flavors with specialties such as white rose dumplings and the @entity47 pancake			0
many of the cafes offer cooking classes so you can master the flavors of the city and take them home with you			2
our cooking class started with a tour of the local market , where we picked up a few fresh ingredients and learned about the local food culture			2
it turns out turmeric will cure all that ails you , according to @entity25 tradition , and durian -- a very smelly fruit -- is an acquired taste			1
after a leisurely boat ride , we arrived at the @entity309			0
under its thatched portico , we learned to make rice paper and spring rolls , cook in a clay pot and fry @entity315 , a shrimp and rice pancake			0
trying to re-create that rice paper turned into an epic disaster back in the @entity318 , but for an afternoon , we were masters of the trade			0
not for everyone , not forever from the madness of @entity8 to the untamed beauty of @entity45 -- each of our destinations offered a unique glimpse into @entity25 culture			1
it 's not for everyone , but for those willing to brave the unknown , the country is ripe with untapped adventures			2
sprawling resorts are popping up , and the booming tourism business has many young people learning how to cater to the nuances of @entity139 culture more often than celebrating their own			0
@entity25 is a country on the cusp			1
in another decade , it may be a cookie - cutter tourist oasis			2
but for now , the spirit of @entity25 remains .			1

a first - time visit to @entity25 *includes* rock climbing and cooking school
@entity45 , a backpacker 's island *paradise* , is an *affordable* *getaway* in @entity125
experiencing @entity8 means embracing the chaos at street level
