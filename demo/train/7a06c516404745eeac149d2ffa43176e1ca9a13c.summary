-- @entity1 could be the first state in the country to impose a limited ban on a controversial method of drilling for natural gas			1
this week , the state assembly passed a hydraulic fracturing moratorium bill , which is currently en route to @entity1 gov. @entity11 's desk			1
he will have 10 days from then to take action			0
in the past , @entity11 has expressed concern about hydraulic fracturing , which involves cracking thousands of feet beneath the earth 's surface to get at valuable natural gas			1
it is unclear if the governor will sign or veto the legislation			0
" he 'll hear what everybody has to say , " a representative of the governor 's office told @entity0			0
she would not provide her name			0
interactive : see how fracking works the assembly voted 93 to 43 monday night to place a temporary moratorium on hydraulic fracturing , so the state can investigate the safety and environmental concerns			1
the @entity38 passed a similar bill in august			0
the moratorium -- which would only be in effect until may -- seeks to halt new drilling permits for horizontal hydraulic fracturing , dubbed " fracking , " a controversial method of extracting natural gas			1
the drilling process has come under scrutiny because of the potential effects on drinking water , public health and the environment			2
can shale gas be produced safely ? if signed into law , @entity1 would be the first state to impose a fracking moratorium , according to the @entity58 @entity57			1
the proposed moratorium in @entity1 was described as " misguided " by @entity60 , who represents a large natural gas industry coalition in the northeast @entity58			2
" tightly - regulated , environmentally sound natural gas development in @entity1 can and will deliver a much - needed and long - lasting economic shot in the arm to not only communities along the @entity68 , but for the entire state , just as it is in @entity70 , @entity71 and elsewhere , " said a written statement from @entity60 , president of the @entity63			1
using hydraulic fracturing , drillers pump large amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals into the shale formation thousands of feet underground under high pressure			1
fracturing the shale around the gas well then allows the natural gas to flow freely			1
the process has raised concerns about whether those chemicals are contaminating the underground water			0
some residents near hydraulic fracturing drill sites along the @entity89 -- located in @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity1 , and @entity70 -- have been able to set their water on fire			1
watch residents set water on fire several residents in rural @entity70 have filed a lawsuit against @entity98 , blaming the company for the contamination			0
the company has said the hydraulic fracturing process is " proven and safe , " citing a 2004 hydraulic fracturing study by the @entity57 that concluded the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids " poses minimal threat " to underground sources of drinking water			1
the @entity57 is currently reviewing its position and plans to issue its report in 2012			0
can the @entity57 regulate fracking ? @entity112 gets roughly half of its water from the @entity89 , which was recently named the country 's most endangered river because of the threat of natural gas			1
last month , @entity112 mayor @entity119 called for a cautious approach to the drilling			2
" the stakes are high , " @entity119 wrote in a november 17 letter to the @entity124 's executive director @entity123			0
" @entity126 has invested more than $ 1.5 billion in watershed protection programs that have resulted in improved water quality throughout our watershed , as well as to our releases downstream , which benefit all members of the @entity124 , and the 15 million people who rely on the @entity89 watershed for clean drinking water , " @entity119 wrote			0
over the past few years , technological advances and increased profit margins have spurred increased use of hydraulic fracturing , according to the @entity57			1
the @entity58 @entity140 estimates shale gas will make up more than 20 percent of the nation 's total natural gas supply by 2020			2
currently , most natural gas is burned to produce electricity or heat and cool buildings			2
when burned , it emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal			0
for that reason , most of the country 's big environmental groups are cautiously supportive of increased shale gas development			0
but , with the expansion of fracturing , there are increased concerns about its potential effects on the underground water table , public health and the environment			0
@entity166 's special series on fracking the concerns have prompted an @entity57 study of the potential problems with fracturing and public hearings to help decide how to conduct the study are almost finished			2
the @entity57 -- which held public meetings this year in @entity175 , @entity1 ; @entity176 , @entity70 ; @entity177 , @entity178 ; and @entity179 , @entity180 -- plans to begin its actual study in january 2011 and release initial study results by late 2012 .			0

@entity112 's state assembly passed a limited ban on hydraulic fracturing
also known as " fracking , " it 's a controversial method of drilling for natural gas
the @entity57 is studying whether fracking contaminates ground water
