-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 was quick to suggest that the death of @entity4 offered a unique opportunity for a wider settlement in a region riven by warfare and insurgency			1
" our message to the @entity12 remains the same , " she said monday			2
" you can not wait us out , you can not defeat us , but you can make the choice to abandon @entity15 and participate in a peaceful political process			2
" that has been a long - cherished ambition of @entity2 foreign policy -- to delink the " good " @entity12 from the " bad " @entity12 and @entity15 as a way of bringing peace to @entity22			1
as @entity24 put in a speech to the @entity26 in february , the @entity23 was to " split the weakened @entity12 off from @entity15 and reconcile those who will renounce violence and accept the @entity22 constitution			1
" achieving that goal has become all the more urgent with the looming deadline to begin the withdrawal of @entity2 and coalition forces from @entity22 , and president @entity35 's goal to complete that withdrawal in 2014			1
former @entity38 foreign secretary @entity37 has argued that the @entity39 had effectively announced the date of the end of the war ; and that was an invitation to the insurgents to bide their time			2
now -- " post @entity4 " - the omens may be more encouraging			2
the secretary of state apparently thinks so			0
events across the @entity49 , she said monday , are changing the political landscape			0
@entity51 are " rejecting extremist narratives and charting a path of peaceful progress based on universal rights and aspirations , " she said			1
a deathblow to @entity15 ? and there is polling to suggest that the appeal of @entity15 's message among @entity51 around the world has sharply eroded , according to regular polling by the @entity63			1
even in @entity64 , only 18 percent had confidence in @entity4 in 2010 , compared to 52 percent in 2005			2
@entity67 online forums were full of hand - wringing in january and february that the uprisings in the @entity49 had passed them by , while offering a variety of strategies for co-opting or taking advantage of the unrest			0
beyond this cultural shift , there are other reasons the @entity12 / @entity15 linkage may now be weaker			1
@entity64 journalist @entity78 , author of " the @entity12 " and " @entity79 " wrote in the @entity80 monday that " the @entity12 do not owe @entity15 anything now that @entity4 is dead			1
" no obvious replacement to succeed @entity4 " renouncing their links with @entity15 and negotiating as @entity22 rather than as members of an international jihad has just become much easier for the @entity12 , " he added			1
the @entity22 @entity12 , a home - grown movement whose principal goal is to expel foreigners , has never had that much in common philosophically with the @entity92 jihadists bent on using @entity22 as the starting point in building a worldwide @entity94			1
they have no record of terrorist acts beyond @entity22 's borders			2
to many observers , it was a marriage of convenience			0
there may also be more prosaic reasons prodding the @entity12 to distance themselves from the @entity15 leadership			1
if the @entity104 did indeed come across what @entity0 terrorism analyst @entity105 described as a " boatload " of evidence during the raid in @entity110 , some of it may ( just may ) help in tracking down members of the @entity115 leadership of the @entity12			2
however , analysts say it 's by no means certain that the @entity12 will perceive this watershed in the way that @entity24 would wish			1
the day before the operation that killed @entity4 , they declared the beginning of their spring offensive			2
they even made a point of warning that members of the @entity126 , established with great fanfare last year by president @entity128 , would be targets			0
and they reiterated their central demand : " the war in our country will not come to an end unless and until the foreign invading forces pull out of @entity22			2
" how @entity2 forces killed @entity4 the @entity12 have been weakened in critical areas in the south of @entity22 , losing strongholds in @entity141 and @entity142 provinces and seeing scores of rank - and - file fighters give up the cause			1
but the fight in the east is as hard as ever -- and non-governmental organizations in @entity150 have also spoken of a growing @entity12 presence in the north			2
@entity2 commanders acknowledge that gains made so far have been fragile -- and are reversible			2
a @entity156 report published last week said that expanding the @entity22 government 's influence and control outside @entity150 had not kept pace with recent security gains			0
so there are few signs that the @entity12 -- even if they are tired of fighting -- can yet be strong - armed into suing for peace			1
in a report for the @entity168 last year , @entity166 argued that the @entity12 have been able to exploit the ineptitude of the government in @entity150			0
" they were able to take advantage of growing disillusionment in the countryside , " he wrote			0
" in particular , the dominance of one particular set of tribes caused members of other , marginalized tribes to look to the insurgency as a source of protection and access to resources			0
" the late @entity184 , who was the @entity2 special envoy to @entity22 and @entity64 , acknowledged that victory on the battlefield was not on the horizon , telling @entity0 's @entity188 last october that " some kind of political element to this is essential , and we are looking at every aspect of this			1
" @entity184 also made the point that the @entity12 did not have a single address , a principal interlocutor like @entity197 or the @entity198			0
" there is a widely dispersed group of people that we roughly call the enemy , " he said			0
referring to the diffuse nature of the @entity12 , @entity37 argues the @entity39 needs to reappraise its goals in @entity22			1
he described @entity22 as " a country of 40,000 villages and valleys , " where a political settlement needs to be " internal with all the tribes and regional with the neighbors			0
" that means a political role for the @entity12			0
" we have to be absolutely clear , i think , that we do see a place for conservative @entity217 in the political settlement , helping govern the south and east of the country , " @entity37 told the @entity215 recently			0
some of the previous contacts between the @entity12 leadership and the government in @entity150 have been managed by @entity224			0
in september 2008 , an eleven - member @entity12 delegation went to @entity226 for talks mediated by @entity228			0
@entity0 's @entity229 reported at the time that the delegation was keen to stress that @entity230 , the @entity12 's spiritual leader , was no longer allied to @entity15			1
but vigorous @entity224 involvement might be problematic now given the @entity233 's focus on its " near abroad : " the chaos in @entity235 and conflict in @entity237 , where @entity224 troops are now stationed			0
add to that the deterioration in the @entity233 's relations with @entity242 over the " @entity243 " and what the @entity224 regard as a reckless abandonment by the @entity35 administration of long - time allies like former @entity249 president @entity248			0
another complicating factor : @entity224 is also looking to improve its relationship with @entity64 as a regional counterweight to @entity254 expansionism , and @entity64 ( which supported the @entity12 when it ruled @entity22 ) very much wants a place at the table in any negotiation on @entity22 's future			1
in the " plus " column , the initiative by @entity261 -- an increasingly assertive regional player -- to allow the @entity12 to open an office there , to help accelerate the peace process			1
but for now it 's just an initiative , not a reality			0
so while @entity4 's demise brings opportunities , there are also great obstacles in making it the first downpayment of a peace dividend			1
@entity24 acknowledged as much when she said monday : " which way it breaks is not clear yet , " she said			0
" managing these reactions will be part of our challenge			0

@entity24 sees death of @entity4 as a *potential* avenue to peace
@entity2 secretary of states says @entity51 are " rejecting extremist narratives "
polls suggest that the appeal of @entity15 is eroding among *muslims* around the world
the @entity12 *shielded* @entity4 in @entity22 for a time
