" that 's the ugliest bird i 've ever seen			1
" the statement does n't so much roll off my tongue as it stumbles out of my mouth as i look at the scrappy tufts of feather on the leathery head of a marabou stork			1
others on the boat mutter similar sentiments			2
" it 's one of the @entity16 , " says @entity14 , our captain and guide on an afternoon safari cruise at @entity21 in @entity23 's @entity22			1
his enthusiasm feels exaggerated for such a hideous bird			2
safaris tend to focus on the so - called @entity27 -- lions , leopards , buffalo , rhinos , elephants -- but the @entity16 makes for a fun alternative for anyone who 's already checked off the safari stars			1
the list runs like a cast call for the " @entity39 's " least majestic animals : marabou stork , hyena , vulture , wildebeest and warthog			1
and we 're here to meet them all			2
@entity46 the marabou stork does n't just rely on its looks -- it 's also got a scent thing going down			1
" they can grow up to five feet long , " says @entity14 as we get close enough to see the scabby - looking beak of one these large birds			2
" and be glad it 's not close enough that you can smell him			1
" everyone , except our guide , cringes as the bird spreads its malodorous 12 - foot wings and takes off from a tree , giving us a full view of its underbelly and wrinkly throat sack			0
the @entity65 is one of two breeding grounds for the marabou stork			1
during mating season , the birds are known to eat live prey , including adult flamingos			1
the stork also goes by the name of the " undertaker bird " in recognition of the grim but important role it plays in the @entity78 -- reducing diseases and cleaning up the ecosystem by devouring rotten carcasses			0
@entity82 one the next morning 's bush walk , we get lucky in spotting a hyena			1
we 're certainly luckier than the smelly dead animal it 's devouring			1
" your nose is the strongest tracker of game , " says @entity14			0
apparently , your ears are the second , but we 're alerted to the hyena 's presence not by its notorious cackling laugh but by the sound of the bones it 's crunching			1
we peer over the brush to see a spotted hyena with its snout in the stomach of an impala			0
before anyone can ask , our guide says : " it probably did n't steal this meal from lions			0
hyenas are very successful hunters			1
" the hyena registers low on the cuteness meter			0
this one could n't get any more ugly unless it was covered in blood			1
my friend @entity117 , disagrees , claiming that hyenas are so unattractive they 're actually endearing			1
" they 're only ugly because they 're villains in movies , " she says			1
showing me a photo of a hyena cub her sister took in @entity129 's @entity128 , she adds , " the babies are so cute ! " that 's debatable , but they certainly get uglier with age			1
as we 're watching , our hyena pulls its bloody face out of the carcass , revealing its elongated neck , hunched gait and dirty , scrappy fur			0
vulture with one of the strongest jaws in the animal world , hyenas do n't leave much for scavengers			1
even so , where there are carcasses , there are usually vultures			1
while the marabou is the only species of stork on the list , the entire vulture family can claim membership to the ugly club			1
circling overhead in a flying " kettle " ( unusual collective noun alert ! ) , the vultures we see are n't too bad to look at			1
their wings silhouette magnificently against the blue sky			0
the illusion is broken when a few fly down to compete with the hyena for impala meat , revealing that though they have the wings of an eagle , they have the face of @entity172			0
it 's no surprise the bird 's hooked beak and hunched stature have inspired a marvel comic villain			1
" their ugliness is efficient , " says @entity14			1
( he says that about all the @entity16			0
) the curved beak is effective in ripping meat , according to our guide			0
the vulture 's ugliest feature , the featherless head and neck , is easy to keep clean after eating carrion			1
logistically , it makes sense			0
esthetically , it 's the stuff of nightmares			2
warthog the warthog is another case of practicality over prettiness			0
these wild pigs are plagued with useful but unappealing warts on both sides of their faces , landing them firmly in the ugly crowd			2
the protuberances protect the faces of male warthogs when they fight , even if they do look like surgery gone wrong			2
warthogs are plentiful in the @entity65			2
anywhere out of scent - range from carnivores , we see warthog families digging for roots with their front knuckles			0
together with warts , shaggy mohawks down their backs and uneven body hair , the warthog is the least appealing pig in the delta ( although their roasted ribs are delicious			0
) they 're shaped like torpedoes with pig noses			0
their bodies seem disproportionately stocky in comparison to their skinny legs and short necks			0
as we 're watching a mother and two babies , someone in our group steps on a twig and spooks them			0
we 're treated to the beautiful sight of warthog butts with tails straight up in the air			0
@entity242 during an afternoon heading out from the @entity78 's @entity244 resort in a mokoro dug - out canoe , we cross paths with the last of the @entity16 : wildebeest			2
as we slosh from one end of the small herd to another , a dozen weary black faces with straggly manes stare us down , perhaps concerned we might try to eat them			0
because they 're one of the most populous safari animals -- and not much to look at -- many people do n't bother to photograph them , says @entity14			2
as the unpretty cousin of the more elegant eland and gazelle , the wildebeest is a peculiar genetic mishmash			0
it has the head of a buffalo , body of an antelope and tail of a shaggy horse			0
its elongated face is connected to a dirty - looking neck fringe and features a mouth shaped , and used , like a lawnmower			0
murky gray bodies decorated with black and white markings add to the unkempt appearance			0
" its ugliness is no problem for mating , they 're practically blind , " @entity14 laughs			2
getting there the only way to get to @entity244 is by small plane , followed by a five - minute boat ride			0
the guided cruise , bush walk and mokoro rides are part of all - inclusive packages for guests			2
accommodations include luxury tents , outdoor showers and nightly hippo serenades			0
@entity295 , @entity296 , @entity23 ; +267 686 0023 ; from $ 335 per person			1
