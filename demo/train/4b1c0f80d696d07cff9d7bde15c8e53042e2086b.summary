@entity0 , @entity1 -- trapped beneath his collapsed home in @entity6 , rescuers had to amputate @entity8 ' right leg in order to free him			1
he was one of the survivors from @entity12 's january 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people			2
@entity8 , 29 , was quickly rushed to a hospital in neighboring @entity1 , where he spent over two months recovering			2
now , he is waiting at a bus stop in @entity0 , heading back to @entity12			2
" staying in the @entity1 is not an option , " he said			2
that 's because the @entity1 's government is forcing @entity12 refugees to return home after they have received medical treatment there			1
but it is unclear where @entity25 and others like him will go			0
it could take more than a decade to rebuild @entity12 's capital , @entity6 , which was devastated by the 7.0 magnitude temblor			0
read more about @entity12 's recovery efforts " we share one island , but it is probably easier to find refuge for @entity12 in @entity38 than in the @entity1 " , said @entity33 , a family friend who accompanied @entity8 back to @entity6			1
@entity12 and @entity1 are united by geography , sharing the island of @entity41 , both former sugar colonies under @entity38 and @entity43 respectively			1
however , @entity12 and @entity1 have had tense relations dating back as far as the mid- 19th century , when @entity12 occupied @entity1 for more than 20 years			1
following this year 's earthquake , @entity1 offered its hospitals and medical services to @entity12			1
that solidarity gave hope to some @entity12 inside the @entity1 that their status may change			1
" this is a double standard policy : @entity12 immigrants are needed in the @entity1 but not wanted , " said @entity52 , who analyzes migration on @entity41			1
@entity1 has always relied heavily on @entity12 workers for its agriculture and construction industries			1
a flood of @entity12 workers poured into the country after the overthrow of @entity12 dictator @entity61 in 1986			0
research conducted before the january 12 quake showed that @entity12 made up nearly 80 percent of @entity1 's agricultural labor force , according to the @entity65 in @entity0 and the @entity66			1
that is a reverse of the government 's required ratio of 80 percent native workers to 20 percent foreign workers			0
while there are no official government statistics , analysts estimate that up to one million unauthorized @entity12 workers live in @entity1			1
although the @entity1 's government says it has beefed up its border security , experts say the border remains porous			0
" @entity83 there are more than 100 trips carried out from the different places [ along the border ] loading @entity12 immigrants , " analyst @entity81 said			2
@entity81 analyzes refugee and immigration patterns for the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity1 , on the border with @entity12			1
there are no exact figures , but based on his observations , @entity81 believes the number of illegal @entity12 workers has quadrupled since the january 12 quake			1
@entity97 , a @entity12 who gives massages to tourists at the @entity102 beach near @entity0 , knows how easy it is to cross			0
" you pay 5,000 pesos [ around $ 140 ] to an agent and if you have problems at the border you pay a little extra , " she explained			0
many @entity12 usually arrive in the @entity1 to work on the sugar plantations for about $ 2 a day			1
like most illegal immigrants with no papers , they face discrimination and live in constant fear of deportation			0
@entity114 has documented the labor conditions of @entity12 and their children in @entity1 sugar plants in her 2007 film , " @entity118			2
" " people who are promised a better life end up on sugar plantations with no identification and no rights , " she said			0
further complicating the immigration issue , @entity1 's new constitution took effect just two weeks after the january earthquake			0
it restricts citizenship for the children of @entity12 immigrants			0
the relationship between @entity12 and the @entity1 is a " work in progress , " according to @entity133 , who monitors poverty data for the government in @entity0			2
" there is a lot of xenophobia against @entity12 , " he said			0
" we are like oil and water , we do n't mix. but we may get closer through this catastrophe			0
" those sentiments mean little for @entity8 , who had to be lifted onto the bus that took him back to @entity12			0
" i want to return to @entity12 , it is my home , " he said			2
" but there is nothing for me now			0
