@entity0 -- the @entity4 attained " actionable intelligence " from bombing suspect @entity6 in the first hours after his arrest on christmas day , @entity3 press secretary @entity2 said tuesday			1
" @entity6 spent a number of hours with @entity4 investigators in which we gleaned useable , actionable intelligence , " @entity2 told reporters			1
according to authorities , @entity14 - born @entity6 tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as a flight from @entity19 , @entity20 , made its final approach to @entity23 , @entity24 , december 25			1
the device failed to fully detonate , instead setting off a fire at the man 's seat			0
@entity2 declined to elaborate on the nature of the intelligence			2
@entity6 , 23 , has been tied to the @entity32 - based group @entity31			1
in a statement to reporters after meeting with his national security team , president @entity33 said @entity38 officials had enough information in their possession before the failed bombing attack to have prevented the suspect from getting on the plane , but had been unable to " connect the dots			2
" @entity33 said he could accept the imperfect nature of intelligence work , " but it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged , " he said , adding : " that 's not acceptable , and i will not tolerate it			0
" " time and again we 've learned that quickly piecing together information and taking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary , " @entity33 said			0
" so we have to do better , and we will do better , and we have to do it quickly			0
@entity38 lives are on the line			0
" in one step , senior @entity60 officials told @entity1 on tuesday that new criteria for information collected on possible terrorists would make it easier to ban them from @entity38 - bound flights			0
speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the material , the officials said the @entity38 has lowered the threshold for information considered important enough to put suspicious individuals on a no - fly list or revoke their visas			0
if the new criteria had been in place before @entity79 , @entity6 would have been added to the no - fly list , the officials said			1
@entity6 is being held at the @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity24 , where he 's still being treated for the burn injuries he received in the failed bombing			2
he faces charges of attempting to destroy an aircraft , and will face his first court hearings friday			0
the suspect apparently arrived in @entity19 already carrying the explosives he planned to use , @entity20 prosecutors said tuesday			1
" the suspect traveled through @entity94 before he arrived via @entity95 [ @entity14 ] at @entity96 , " prosecutors said , referring to the airport where @entity6 boarded the flight to @entity23			1
" so far , it seems he already had the explosives with him before he landed at @entity96			0
" also tuesday , @entity99 officials announced that @entity101 's @entity100 will introduce more body scanners within weeks , and that all @entity99 airports must have equipment to detect explosives by the end of the year			1
@entity99 home secretary @entity107 said the @entity99 government had no evidence @entity6 had been planning an attack			1
@entity107 added that @entity99 authorities were directing airports to carry out more random searches of passengers because metal detectors can not spot explosives without metal parts			1
last week , @entity33 blamed human error and security lapses for the failure by officials to act on information that @entity6 was a possible terrorist threat			1
he had a valid multiple - entry @entity38 visa			0
his father , a leading banker in @entity14 , had warned @entity38 authorities before the attack that his son might be involved with @entity129 extremists , but the information failed to prompt a response such as canceling the visa			0
tuesday 's @entity3 meetings were held just hours after the @entity38 reopened its embassy in @entity32			2
it 's believed that @entity6 may have received training in @entity32 from the group @entity31			1

a statement posted on the @entity146 's web site said " successful counter-terrorism operations " conducted by @entity32 security forces monday north of the @entity32 capital , @entity150 , addressed " a specific area of concern and have contributed to the @entity146 's decision to resume operations			0
" @entity32 's state - run news agency , @entity155 , reported monday that two @entity31 suspects were killed and two others were injured in clashes with a @entity32 anti-terrorism unit			2
