@entity0 -- the @entity3 's declaration sunday that @entity4 is engaged in a civil war -- or in the organization 's legalistic phrasing , a " non-international armed conflict " -- may have struck some observers as a case of stating the obvious			1
but the assessment from the @entity13 - based body is significant			0
it means the violence that has plagued the @entity17 nation since early 2011 has crossed a legal threshold whereby combatants throughout the country are subject to the @entity21 -- and as such can be prosecuted for war crimes			1
who are the @entity3 ? the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) is the guardian of the @entity21 , which set down the rules of war			1
the organization was formed after the @entity29 in 1859 in @entity30			0
a @entity32 businessman , @entity31 , encountered nearly 40,000 wounded , dying and dead lying unattended on the battlefield			0
he subsequently lobbied for the establishment of a permanent humanitarian relief agency to act during times of war , protected by a government treaty recognizing the neutrality of the agency and safeguarding its operations			2
these goals were realized through the establishment of the @entity3 and the @entity45 , ratified by 12 nations in 1864			2
@entity31 was jointly awarded the first @entity47 in 1901 for his efforts			0
part of the @entity3 's legal mandate is to determine whether an armed conflict exists , and whether international humanitarian law applies			1
what is the @entity24 's new assessment of the situation ? the @entity24 's classification of the violence as a " non-international armed conflict " means international humanitarian law will extend beyond the three regions in @entity4 where the organization had previously determined to be areas of armed conflict -- namely @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 -- to apply wherever fighting occurs			1
" these rules impose limits on all parties on how fighting can be conducted , with the aim of protecting the civilian population and persons not , or no longer , directly participating in the hostilities , " said @entity24 spokeswoman @entity68 told @entity1			2
the @entity24 will work to remind both the @entity4 government and the armed opposition of their obligations to respect international humanitarian law , and share its analysis of what is occurring with both sides			1
it is hoped this will have an effect on the way the war is fought , by helping to regulate the conduct of fighters and safeguard the rights of innocents affected by the violence			0
how was the violence in @entity4 classified previously ? for months , the @entity3 has classified the violence in @entity4 as internal armed conflicts between government forces and armed opposition groups localized to three flashpoints mentioned above			1
but the spread of hostilities to other areas has led the @entity32 - based agency to conclude the fighting meets its threshold for an internal armed conflict			0
international humanitarian law now applies " wherever hostilities take place , " the organization said monday			1
what are the @entity21 ? the @entity21 and their additional protocols are international treaties that , in the words of the @entity3 , " contain the most important rules limiting the barbarity of war			1
" applicable during times of armed conflict , they form the cornerstone of international humanitarian law , setting rules for the treatment of people who are not participating in the fighting -- civilians , health workers and aid workers -- as well as for the wounded , sick or prisoners of war			1
read the 1949 @entity21 here common article 3 of the conventions , which relates to " non-international armed conflicts " -- the most common form of conflict in the world today -- is applicable to the situation in @entity4			2
" the term " civil war " , often used as a synonym for " internal armed conflict " ( or ) " armed conflict not of an international character , " has no legal status , " said @entity68			1
special rules apply to the most serious contraventions of the law , which are termed grave breaches and constitute war crimes			1
what counts as a " grave breach ? " these crimes include willful killing , torture or inhumane treatment , including biological experiments ; willfully causing great suffering or serious injury ; and wanton , unlawful extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity			0
read the definition of grave breaches here @entity160 that are party to the conventions have an obligation to seek and put on trial or extradite those responsible for grave breaches , regardless of their nationality			0
what is the history of the @entity21 ? efforts to moderate the behavior of soldiers are as old as recorded history itself			2
in the sixth century @entity177 , the @entity176 general and military strategist @entity174 suggested specific restrictions on military conduct , while in 1625 , the @entity181 theorist @entity180 called for civilian protections in " on the @entity183			0
" throughout the history of warfare , agreements on the rules of war were defined by custom or negotiated between generals prior to battle , but did not extend widely beyond the conflict in question			0
the modern @entity21 were adopted in 1949 , in the aftermath of @entity195 , and expanded their focus to include civilians for the first time , in an attempt to prevent another outbreak of the " total war " which had wreaked havoc on civilian populations			2
who recognizes the @entity21 ? the @entity21 entered into force on 21 october 1950 and have gradually grown in recognition to become universally applicable			2
more than 70 countries ratified the conventions during the 1950s , and today 194 nations are party to the agreement			0
do they have an impact on the battlefield ? according to the @entity24 , yes			0
while the nature of war has changed radically in the decades since the conventions were drafted , they continue to act as a powerful deterrent to the commission of atrocities in times of conflict			0
the @entity24 's director of international law @entity223 told @entity1 in 2009 that enforcing compliance with the conventions , rather than recodifying their core principles , should be a priority for international humanitarian law			1
@entity230 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity3 has determined that @entity4 is in a state of civil war
this means international humanitarian law applies wherever there is fighting
the @entity21 , *overseen* by the @entity3 , govern behavior in war *zones*
they lay the legal groundwork for war crimes prosecutions
