in 2014 , beheading a westerner proved to be a chillingly effective strategy for @entity4 militants			1
the killings of @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 were both barbaric and uniquely modern			1
the murderers acted with a key demographic in mind , knowing that millions of people would tune in to watch			2
so the camera has created a new kind of crowd in the course of our long history of public beheadings			1
its entrance on the scene , in @entity25 , on 17 june 1939 , had a similarly immediate and unequivocal effect			2
that morning , the public guillotining of @entity31 serial killer @entity30 , outside the @entity27 in @entity28 , was filmed by a spectator -- unbeknownst to the authorities			1
you can see the footage online today			2
photographers also recorded the action , and their pictures filled newspapers and magazines in the days after @entity30 's death			2
as if the rowdy crowds on the day were not bad enough , now the action could be viewed again and again by untold thousands of voyeurs			2
after that , the guillotine was rolled away behind prison walls -- not because decapitations were too horrifying to watch , but because people will watch them no matter how horrifying they are			2
for centuries , public executions had been intended to terrify by example , when for many they were little more than light entertainment			1
the advent of film proved this beyond @entity58 the history of beheadings tells us anything , it is that there will always be people who want to see			1
today the @entity66 offers us front - row seats , on the understanding that no one need know we have taken our places to watch			2
murders can be " nothing to do with us " even as we click on the screen to play the film			2
in the 21st century , spectators experience a sense of detachment from the event -- which has already happened at some point in the past and in " another world " supposedly far removed from our own -- alongside an unprecedented sense of intimacy			0
now we can watch close - up , but in private , in our own time and space			0
the recent @entity89 beheadings were experienced by many viewers like a gruesome serial drama , and the murderers know we will tune in for the next episode			1
even those who do not watch the @entity89 " show " can hardly avoid the media analysis that accompanies each instalment			1
producing these films requires relatively little organization , money or complicated technology			0
compared to other terrorist offenses , it is low - tech and high - impact			0
the action can be carefully choreographed while retaining its ruthless authenticity , and the results are sensational			0
the camera has become a new stage for public beheadings , a new spike for displaying a trophy head			1
when pathological criminals behead innocent civilians , the murderers address their audience and present their spoils , drawing those who watch into their narrative			0
the entire spectacle denotes the powerlessness of the victim , and , by extension , the powerlessness of their countrymen to intervene			0
spectators who watch beheadings online impotently fulfil the perpetrators ' desire to be seen			1
the @entity89 murderers have relied on sophisticated manipulation of social media sites to ensure that their footage appears on our screens before we even know what we are watching			1
at the same time , a person 's reaction can reverberate through the cyber-crowd instantaneously , creating the kind of group mentality that mirrors the dynamics of a real crowd			1
when the footage of @entity6 's murder circulated via social media platforms like @entity151 and @entity152 in august 2014 , a @entity146 activist named @entity147 asked people not to share it and initiated the hashtag # @entity155			0
" pour water on their flame , " she tweeted			0
the movement to boycott the film gathered momentum in the hours that followed , and @entity151 responded by removing tweets that embedded the video or screenshots of it			0
for the first time since the death of @entity170 in @entity171 in 2004 , the silent majority found a voice , and more and more members of the crowd refused to watch			1
a group of militants had tried to make an impact , in an appalling way , and their efforts were beginning , just beginning , to fail			0
when the victim of a beheading is bound and defenceless , he or she becomes a pawn in somebody else 's production			0
the power no longer derives from the act of decapitation itself , which may require a pathological perpetrator , but it does not require the luck and skill to win a fight			0
instead , the power emerges from the reception the slayer receives as he plays his part on the stage			0
there is no triumph in the killer 's actions until we watch			0
modern technology may offer a hiding place to voyeurs , but it can also give a voice to human decency			0
no good can ever come from murder , but if public opinion is able to neutralize the killers ' triumph by refusing to broadcast the graphic imagery they want us to see , then this is a step forward			1
