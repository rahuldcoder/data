@entity0 , @entity1 -- protesters of a tuition hike at @entity6 campuses stood their ground into friday night , with 41 demonstrators at @entity9 cited for trespassing after their takeover of a campus building			1
nearly 100 protesters at @entity6 campuses have been arrested over the past two days in the demonstrations over a 32 percent tuition increase			1
the demonstrators , students and nonstudents alike , were cited for trespassing , spokeswoman @entity16 told @entity2			1
@entity16 said those arrested would be cited and released rather than taken to jail , per agreement with student leaders			2
three students were arrested earlier at @entity9 in the wake of protests across several campuses that have shaken up the @entity6 system a day after officials approved a tuition increase to be enacted over the next two school years			1
@entity6 officials said the $ 505 million to be raised by the tuition increases is needed to prevent even deeper cuts than those already made because of @entity1 's persistent financial crisis			1
protesting students said the hike will hurt working and middle - class students who benefit from state - funded education			1
the first tuition hike , which takes effect in january , will raise undergraduate tuition to $ 8,373			1
the second hike kicks in next fall , raising tuition to $ 10,302 , said university spokeswoman @entity49			1
students who live on campus could pay up to an estimated $ 17,200 in additional fees that include the annual cost of books and housing , according to the system 's july 2008 finance guide			2
the january increase of about 15 percent is more than double the average public university tuition hike last year			1
on average , tuition and fees at four - year public universities nationwide increased 6.5 percent , or to $ 7,020 , since the previous school year , according to data from @entity65			1
students eligible for financial aid and whose families make under $ 70,000 will have their tuition covered , the university said			1
@entity71 , a @entity72 student , told @entity2 she 'd have to request additional loans to pay for school and that with her brother starting at @entity9 soon the cost would place a heavier burden on her family			2
she , too , participated in the student outcries against the increase , she said			0
and many other students had yet to back down friday			2
on the @entity83 campus -- where building occupations began last week with a library sit - in -- about 100 students staged a sit - in in the second - floor lobby of @entity89 soon after hearing the tuition hike had been approved , according to @entity83 provost @entity91			1
many remained there friday afternoon			0
the demonstrators made demands , @entity91 said without listing them			2
they would not keep exits clear and broke into some parts of the building , he said , adding they are trespassing and could be arrested			1
in addition , the students could face suspension or expulsion			2
" we cherish the principle of free speech , " @entity91 said			0
" regrettably , these actions go well beyond that			0
" at @entity9 on friday morning , students occupied the second floor of @entity112 , @entity9 spokeswoman @entity109 said			1
campus police broke through a barricaded of furniture and office equipment on the ground floor and arrested three students , she said			2
the protesters demanded the reinstatement of 38 custodial staff members recently laid off , according to a @entity9 news release			2
the demonstrators also asked for amnesty and for a drop of charges against any protesters			0
are you there ? share your images , video an additional 250 demonstrators remained outside @entity112 into the night , according to @entity16			0
authorities arrested dozens of angry students on the campus late thursday after they refused to vacate the school 's administration building			1
the 52 students were taken into custody by the @entity139 and deputies from the @entity141 , according to @entity142 , a @entity143 spokeswoman			0
the arrests at @entity145 , the campus ' main administration building , came about four hours after the normal 5 p.m. pt ( 8 p.m. et ) closing time			0
at one point , as many as 150 students were at the building protesting the tuition increase , @entity142 said			1
@entity72 's @entity154 was occupied for several hours thursday evening , a school spokesman said			0
the takeover was not planned or sanctioned by the main protest organizer -- the @entity157 , according to @entity157 representative @entity158			0
the same building was briefly occupied wednesday night by several dozen student protesters , according to a @entity72 news release			0
the building was the site of the 1969 shooting deaths of two @entity165 members during an internal dispute , according to the release			0
the @entity72 campus was the scene of the largest and loudest demonstrations thursday			0
" we 're fired up			0
ca n't take it no more , " students chanted as they marched and waved signs at @entity72			0
" education only for the rich , " one sign read			0
some faculty members and campus workers -- worried about furloughs and layoffs to come -- joined the protesting students			2
" stop cuts in education and research , " a sign carried by a teacher said			0
after the regents voted , students rushed to parking decks to stage a sit - in to block regents ' vehicles from leaving			2
campus police and @entity195 officers in riot gear stood nearby			0
as one regent member walked out , students lining his path shouted , " shame on you , shame on you			0
" the situation ended without incident as students gradually left the scene			0
university executives told the regents the fee hikes are needed because they 've already made deep spending cuts in the past two years -- cuts forced by the state budget			1
about 26 percent of the $ 20 billion spent each year by the system comes from the state 's general fund coupled with tuition and fees paid by students , according to a summary on the regent 's web site			1
the fee increases are to be balanced by a raise in " the level of financial assistance for needy low - and middle - income students , " according to a statement from the @entity229			1
the tuition hike is expected to raise $ 505 million for the university system , and about $ 175 million of that money is to go toward student financial aid , the board said			1
@entity2 's @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report .			0
