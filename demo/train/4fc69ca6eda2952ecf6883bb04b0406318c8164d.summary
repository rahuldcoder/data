except for one lapse , @entity2 has always maintained healthy eating habits			1
" when we arrived in @entity11 we ate too much as there had been very little food during the escape			0
jewish food is also not particularly healthy			0
" that slightly destroyed my stomach and i have since cooked very healthily -- many fruits and vegetables and very little fat			0

" @entity2 admits she sometimes thinks about death : " i just wonder how it will happen			1

" but @entity2 , who speaks six languages fluently , does n't dwell on the subject			1
she prefers to concentrate on the present			0
