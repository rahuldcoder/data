-- @entity1 has revealed that he hopes to resurrect the @entity3 @entity2 , a race he won six times during his illustrious @entity7 career			1
the four - time world champion driver is meeting with @entity7 supremo @entity9 about reinstating the event , which was last held in 2008 , at @entity11 near @entity12			1
" we were very close to organizing a @entity3 @entity2 in @entity17 a few years ago and now i 've been asked to advise and see if everything is correct , " the former @entity14 driver told @entity0 ahead of this weekend 's @entity15			1
" i have the opportunity to meet @entity9 and we 'll see what happens			0
it might be the right timing , that 's all i can say			2
but in the end it is always a question of money			0
" the @entity3 picked up the first of his 51 grand prix wins at his home race in 1981			1
that year it was held in @entity32 , which was rotated as a venue with @entity34 from the early 1970s until @entity35 took over in 1991			2
" we could have organized a race in @entity17 a few years ago which was really the best project , " explained @entity1 , who also raced for @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 during a 13 - year spell behind the wheel			1
" if we can not do that , i think the @entity11 is really the best place ... in @entity45 , we are in a way missing @entity7			1
we still have some races but we miss the historical races			0
" we still have @entity49 , we still have @entity50 , but we see that it is not that easy to organize			0
we have been everywhere in the world for the benefit of @entity7 but at the end of the day , the culture , the tradition of @entity7 and motor racing is really in @entity45			0
" @entity1 has special attachment to the track in @entity60 , where he took some of his first steps on the road to @entity7			2
" i feel a little bit nostalgic , " he said			0
" in my heart i would be very pleased -- it became a fantastic track , a fantastic place and it would be a shame not to use it			0
" i have a lot of memories			0
it 's like @entity50 in @entity72			2
if you stop racing you lose almost all of the history from the country and that is not good			0
" after this weekend 's @entity80 race , teams will stay at the @entity81 to take part in the annual young driver test event -- where a @entity1 will take to an @entity7 track for the first time since the @entity86			1
@entity1 's oldest son @entity87 is a development driver for the @entity89 team , formerly known as @entity36			1
the 31 - year - old is a latecomer to motorsport , instead deciding to attend university in the @entity94 where he was a keen golfer			0
" i feel proud about what he 's doing today , " said @entity1			1
" he 's going to follow what the team want him to do , i know they are testing a few things for next year			2
it 's exactly what he wants to do			0
" @entity1 is unsure whether his son will follow him onto the grid , saying : " we 'll wait and see			2
he 's very realistic , that is his quality			0
so he 's not going to be disappointed			0
" meanwhile , reports have suggested @entity7 teams face increased entry fees next season as the sport looks to increase revenue			1
@entity116 's world governing body , the @entity117 , will charge every entrant $ 500,000 plus further expenses for each championship point won this season			1
the constructors ' champions -- likely to be @entity124 -- will have to pay $ 6,000 per point , compared to $ 5,000 for the rest of the teams , according to the @entity127 website			2
if these financial rules had been in place at the start of the 2012 season , @entity124 would have had to part with $ 4.4 million to enter the championship after picking up 650 points in 2011			1
meanwhile , @entity135 's late - season charge towards a historic third successive drivers ' title gathered pace as the @entity124 driver set the fastest time in practice ahead of sunday 's grand prix			1
the @entity142 , who holds a 13 - point lead over @entity37 's @entity145 with just three races to go , pipped @entity14 's @entity148 - bound @entity147 by 0.168 seconds on friday			0
@entity135 , the youngest double world champion in @entity7 history , has won the last four grands prix to derail @entity145 's bid to win @entity37 's first world championship since 2007 and his third overall			1
the @entity154 struggled to match the frontrunners , finishing the final session seventh fastest .			0
