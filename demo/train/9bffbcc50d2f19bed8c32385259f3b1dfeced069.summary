@entity0 -- troubling questions over @entity4 's controversial death penalty system will remain unresolved for now , after the @entity5 declined monday to review an appeal from a death - row inmate who received unwanted help from state prosecutors on his legal representation			1
the justices without comment rejected @entity14 ' request for relief			1
he says he sat in jail for years after the state ran out of money to pay for his lawyers			0
@entity14 said prosecutors then suggested that a judge appoint two public defenders , even offering the names of two overworked and inexperienced attorneys who did not want the job			0
@entity14 ' current legal team calls that a blatant conflict of interest			0
at issue is whether @entity14 ' constitutional right to a speedy trial and competent defense were short - circuited by an ongoing budget shortfall			1
dozens of other inmates who lack financial resources to afford their own attorneys have made similar accusations			0
the @entity4 @entity5 concluded the indigent defense system was functioning adequately , if not perfectly			1
the state justices also said @entity14 was partly to blame for the delays because of his unwillingness to work with his legal team , and should have accepted the public defenders			1
the state has said he was never without legal representation			0
@entity14 was convicted in the 2006 murder of @entity48 during a robbery			0
two private attorneys were originally named to represent him , but a lack of funding forced a judge to instead appoint the two public defenders			0
the new legal defense team later tried three times to withdraw , citing a bursting caseload , a lack of experience handing a capital case , and a lack of money to hire investigators to prove @entity14 ' claimed innocence			2
his current lawyers , from the @entity65 , say @entity14 has suffered greatly behind bars because of the long appeal process			2
he has reportedly tried to commit suicide three times			0
@entity4 revised its system by creating a taxpayer - funded public defender system in 2003 , and an office to deal just with death penalty cases , which generally undergo greater judicial scrutiny and take longer to work their way through the courts			1
but problems in the program popped up almost instantly , exacerbated by the high - profile prosecution of @entity79 , who was convicted of escaping from a prison cell and killing a judge and three others in an @entity84 courthouse in 2005			0
that case ate up $ 3 million in state funds , nearly draining the new office 's budget			1
another $ 30 million raised from court fees and fines was diverted by the state legislature to a general fund , creating more budget uncertainty for the defender office			2
the @entity95 @entity5 in recent years has taken a close look at @entity4 's capital punishment procedures			1
now - retired justice @entity98 in 2008 slammed the state 's high court for an " utterly perfunctory " review of a death penalty case			1
the justices last year also ordered a federal court to review whether @entity105 received a fair hearing			2
he was convicted of murdering a @entity108 police officer in 1989 , but has earned high - profile support from those who claim the state has repeatedly refused to examine new evidence showing he may be innocent of the crime			0
state and federal courts have repeatedly rejected his claims			0
that case could again be back on the @entity5 's radar in coming months			1
the case rejected monday is @entity121 ( 09 - 10715 ) .			2

the case involves an inmate 's complaint of trial delay *due* to a budget shortfall
@entity4 's @entity5 ruled the system worked adequately
@entity95 justices reject the appeal without comment
