amid the chaos and the grief , the politics and the finger pointing , we are no closer to answering some key questions about the downing of @entity7 17			2
the crash , which killed all 298 people aboard , has turned a volatile @entity11 region into a global problem			1
here are five questions we do n't yet have the answers to			0
who shot down the plane ? only a full investigation can settle that			2
this much we know : @entity20 was shot down using a surface - to - air missile in @entity11 territory that 's controlled by @entity24 rebels			1
@entity11 's government says it has " compelling evidence " that a @entity28 - supplied battery , manned by @entity28 operatives , fired the missile			1
the @entity31 has also pointed the finger at the @entity28 - trained rebels			0
" we have a video showing a launcher moving back through a particular area there , out into @entity28 , with at least one missing missile on it , " secretary of state @entity34 said on @entity36 's " @entity35 " on sunday			0
but @entity28 has denied any involvement			0
so have the rebels , who accuse the @entity11 of downing the plane -- without offering proof			1
why would anyone target a passenger plane ? if indeed the rebels are behind the attack , they may have mistaken @entity20 for a @entity11 military aircraft			1
in the past few months , the rebels have used surface - to - air missiles to bring down more than a dozen planes , including two transport aircraft , the @entity31 @entity53 in @entity54 said			0
shortly after the crash , @entity59 , the self - proclaimed defense minister of the @entity60 , claimed on social media that the rebels had shot down a military transport plane			0
those posts were later deleted once it turned out the plane was a civilian aircraft			0
" it has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an aircraft that they may have believed was @entity11 , " @entity70 sen. @entity69 told @entity71			1
why was the plane flying over a war zone ? most airlines follow rules set by national civil aviation authorities and take the most direct route available , said @entity82 , a former inspector general of the @entity31 @entity83			2
the @entity85 flight left @entity86 for @entity87 , @entity7			0
it flew over eastern @entity11 , which is a common route for international carriers			1
last week , @entity91 , the agency responsible for coordinating @entity93 airspace , said @entity11 authorities had closed airspace in the region below 32,000 feet ( about 9,750 meters ) , but it was open at the level @entity20 was flying ( 33,000 feet )			1
" there 's a lot of questions to be asked in a lot of different places , " @entity36 aviation analyst @entity98 said			0
" why did n't government officials close off that airspace completely ? 32,000 feet , that 's a completely arbitrary number			1
when will international investigators get access to the crash site ? no one knows			2
a @entity111 meeting ended early monday , with @entity112 introducing a resolution that called for a swift international investigation			1
" there 's no doubt that at the moment , the site is under the control of the @entity28 - backed rebels			0
and given the almost certain culpability of the @entity28 - backed rebels in the downing of the aircraft , having those people in control of the site is a little like leaving criminals in control of a crime scene , " @entity112 prime minister @entity120 said monday			0
but @entity28 , which has veto power as a permanent member of the council , wants a modified resolution -- one that leaves out @entity11 from any investigation			1
how will @entity28 respond ? if an investigation concludes the plane was shot down by rebels using a @entity28 - supplied missile -- or , worse still , by @entity28 themselves -- president @entity142 will have two choices			1
and neither , says professor @entity144 , works to his advantage			1
@entity142 could reject the conclusions and stand by the rebels			2
if he does so , he risks becoming an international pariah			2
the @entity149 might also hit @entity28 with even tougher economic sanctions , enough to cripple its economy and send it into a recession			0
or , @entity142 could sever ties with the rebels			2
but that could present problems , too			0
" a relentless barrage of propaganda has convinced many @entity28 that their co-ethnics in @entity167 and @entity168 are being massacred by troops commanded by a fascist regime in @entity54 , " said @entity144 , who teaches political science at the @entity159 , @entity160 , and who authored the book the return : @entity28 's journey from @entity172 to @entity173			0
" " for @entity142 to bow to international pressure and abandon his former charges would look like cowardice			1

the @entity111 is calling for a swift international investigation
@entity142 has two choices ; neither works to his advantage
