-- if an e-mail popped up in your inbox promising a house for $ 100 , you 'd expect to see it sent from a guy in @entity7 asking you to wire him several thousand dollars first			1
@entity8 lies on his front lawn and spends a quiet afternoon with his neighbors			2
but this depressed housing market dream is real			2
and @entity12 , @entity13 , artist @entity14 and his wife , @entity15 , are living it			1
the couple never counted on owning a home			1
" it 's not that we have a little money , " @entity14 said , laughing			2
" i 'm saying we have no money			2
" but the couple began entertaining the idea of a permanent nest when their friends @entity26 and @entity29 , also artists , started taking advantage of foreclosures in the city , where the average home price dipped to $ 11,533 in april , according to the @entity35			1
dragging down the average are homes that are long abandoned or foreclosed on that are selling for pennies on the dollar			1
@entity12 already had the lowest market value houses in @entity13 before the latest rounds of job losses at @entity45 and other huge employers , market analysts say			1
" those artists are doing a good thing ; they are at least helping to stabilize neighborhoods that would be all but lost , " said @entity47 , an investment adviser who blogs frequently about @entity12 's economy			1
for less than a few thousand dollars , @entity26 and @entity29 snapped up a dilapidated bungalow in a north @entity12 neighborhood called " @entity54 , " for its unexpected mix of @entity56 , african - americans , @entity58 and @entity59 and the occasional shady character			1
@entity61 had cleaned the house to the bone			1
the copper had been stolen ; the electrical wiring was stripped			2
here was a chance for @entity26 and @entity29 , who run a popular @entity12 art store , to rehabilitate the 1920s brick house into a bastion of energy savings , with solar panels , led lights , recycled wood and high - end insulated windows			1
they 're installing a security system that exemplifies elegant efficiency with hurricane - proof windows and steel doors replacing burglar bars			2
they are also experimenting with running their air - conditioning on a car battery			0
the project became known as the @entity88			1
@entity26 and @entity29 wanted to create a central place to power homes nearby and , in turn , revive a neighborhood 's sense of community			1
the trick was getting their friends not only to cheer the concept but invest in it by moving next door			0
" it was much easier than we thought it might be , " @entity26 said			0
" we told everyone that @entity12 is an interesting city to work in as an artist , and the neighborhood is diverse			1
but , really , it came down to money			0
" " i kept telling @entity26 , ' wow those are an awesome , ridiculously good deals but if you find anything that 's less , let me know , " @entity14 said			0
" like , if something comes along for next to nothing , cool			0
" a few weeks later , @entity26 e-mailed @entity14 a photo of an abandoned home on his block			1
its windows were boarded up and plywood was nailed across the front door			0
the huge hole in the roof was courtesy of the fire department			0
a neighbor said the house had been set on fire -- twice			1
@entity14 called a real estate agent with the @entity129 , who confirmed that bids on the foreclosed property started at $ 95 for the property , $ 5 for the house			1
there were no back taxes -- no one seemed to be sure who once owned the house , it had been empty for so long , @entity14 said			1
@entity26 , also a designer and builder , and an inspector did a walk - through			0
" inspection was fine and @entity26 told me the foundation was good , " @entity14 said			0
" he just said , ' if you did n't mind scraping some peeling paint , doing some surface treatments , putting in new utilities , windows and repairing the roof ... this could be pretty interesting			0
' " now , when he 's not hauling loads of rubble away or knocking out walls to create a single , open studio space , @entity14 's searching @entity157 for a furnace			0
in exchange for designing the business web site of a local barn recycler , he 's getting materials to turn that hole in his roof into a skylight			0
" i saw it as a project , " the artist said			0
" i 'm a builder			0
i 've been building skateboards since i was 12			0
" skateboards are one thing			0
rebuilding homes where the plumbing has been ripped out or the cabinets destroyed in a fit by an upset foreclosed homeowner is another			0
@entity13 housing authorities acknowledge that there 's little incentive for people who are n't quite as handy as @entity14			0
in two weeks , the state will begin offering $ 25,000 to anyone who buys a home , as long as they pay 1 percent of the total cost and live in it			1
landlords or speculators are n't eligible			0
part of a $ 263 million grant given to @entity13 and other states under 2008 's @entity194 , the funds are intended to help buyers bring trashed properties up to code , according to @entity198 , a director with the @entity199			1
she and other housing officials @entity0 spoke with said @entity13 's economy has some extremely frustrating woes			0
a report from the nonprofit think tank @entity204 said @entity12 had the lowest performing economy out of 100 @entity207 cities it analyzed -- scoring the worst in unemployment and average wages , the highest foreclosure rates and the lowest market value homes			1
the artists in @entity54 are careful to say they are not looking to change a city			1
their goal is simply to improve a neighborhood , one house at a time			1
new neighbors , freelance photographer @entity219 and her husband @entity8 , a designer , are always checking out @entity221 , where a stainless steel kitchen sink can be bought for $ 65			1
the @entity224 bought their 660 - square - foot home for $ 549.99 from @entity26 and @entity29 , who originally purchased the foreclosed home for $ 500			1
" we knew the property , we knew it had been sitting there empty for at least a year , and it had been trashed , " @entity219 said			2
" but we wanted to own a home			2
" all the copper in their " micro-home " had been ripped out , as well as every electrical outlet , @entity219 said			0
@entity236 had to be hauled out in several loads			0
" you have to get over that fear that the house had that history , that you 're going to be a victim of a crime or something , " she said			2
my husband and i have lived in the city for a long time ; we know that people look out for each other here			0
we do n't have that kind of fear			0
" careful not to entice thieves again , the @entity224 replaced the copper with plastic			0
they are considering taking the home completely off the grid by installing a mini-wind turbine , but for now they are happy to put in the basics			2
a bathtub from @entity263 cost them $ 100			1
and @entity8 , who works at the @entity264 , brings home wood the museum would otherwise toss when installations close			2
" this is , for us , very exciting to believe that we could totally reinvent a space , " she said , " and prove that having a home is n't about having money			2

@entity12 artists buy a trashed , abandoned house for $ 100 , fix it up
other artists have bought cheap houses in the same neighborhood
the @entity88 was the first home , meant to power the other houses nearby
