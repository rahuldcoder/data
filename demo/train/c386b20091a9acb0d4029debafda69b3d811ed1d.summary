-- @entity2 scientists say they have captured the first - ever detailed airborne measurements of a major iceberg about to break off into the sea			1
" a lot of times when you 're in science , you do n't get a chance to catch the big stories as they happen because you 're not there at the right place at the right time			0
but this time we were , " @entity15 , a scientist with the @entity2 survey team that captured the data said in a video posted to @entity2 's website			2
the discovery of the approximately 340 - square - mile iceberg - to - be came october 14 as scientists were flying over the glacier as part of @entity27 , a six - year mission to map a three - dimensional view of @entity30 and @entity32 ice , according to @entity2			1
scientists aboard the flight noticed a large crack in the glacier and asked colleagues in the @entity38 to review satellite data to see when it appeared , according to the @entity2 video			1
those scientists said the 18 - mile - long crack , which is now between 260 feet and 820 feet wide and up to 195 feet deep , appeared in early october			0
the crack is the first step in the iceberg breaking off from the @entity47 and slipping into the ocean			0
such events are fairly common but still major from a scientific perspective , @entity15 said			0
the @entity2 crew was able to use laser range - finding tools to create a three - dimensional map of the rift , the first time such an image has been created , said @entity27 project scientist @entity57			1
" it 's part of a natural process but it 's pretty exciting to be here and actually observe it while it happens , " he said in an article posted to the @entity2 website			2
@entity2 did not indicate when the iceberg might break off from the glacier			2
when it does , the leading edge of the @entity47 ice shelf will have receded more than at any time since the 1940s , when the ice shelf was first mapped , @entity2 said .			0

@entity2 scientists discover and map an iceberg in the making
their observations are the first detailed airborne measurements of such a *phenomenon*
the iceberg will be about 340 square miles
