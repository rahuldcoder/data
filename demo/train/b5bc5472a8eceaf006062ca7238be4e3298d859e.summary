-- @entity2 's decision to not include a camera in the new @entity4 is somewhat surprising			1
after all , there is already a perfect camera for the job , and it sits inside the @entity8			2
by not adding a camera to its @entity4 , @entity2 may boost sales of its @entity11			1
that @entity2 included a video camera inside the @entity11 makes this more inexplicable still -- the @entity2 of today is clearly happy to put cameras into its media players ( unlike the first @entity8 , whose camera was so poor we thought it was just a petulant capitulation to cellphone norms )			1
leaving the camera out is also a clear signal not to upgrade the @entity4 , as -- apart from a larger @entity23 model -- the only hardware change is the juiced - up processor , making the @entity4 run faster like its older brother the @entity27			2
perhaps @entity2 is putting the @entity4 on a two - year update plan like the @entity8 , letting people keep their pocket computers for a little longer than usual			1
had the @entity4 included a camera , i would be knocking on the store doors right now to buy one , along with @entity23 ready to be filled with photos and video			2
so the excitement falls to the @entity37 , which , sports a new shiny coating , a 640 x 480 video camera ( no stills ) and a larger screen on the outside , and an fm radio on the inside with a @entity46 live - pause feature			1
the radio itself is odd enough , and the first to be included in any @entity4			0
more on that in a moment			0
the @entity37 's video camera was introduced with reference to @entity54 's own tiny , no - zoom camcorder			1
there are two @entity54 camcorders at the @entity37 's $ 150 price : the @entity58 and the @entity59			1
to get @entity61 and @entity37 you jump to $ 200			0
the @entity62 costs $ 180			0
why would somebody buy a @entity54 ? the easy , one button recording , perhaps ( with the @entity37 , you need to go to a menu item to open the video camera application ) , but that 's it			1
take a look at the sample videos at the @entity69 and you 'll see that the @entity37 's quality is easily " good enough			1
" there is another surprise in there , too			0
the tiny @entity37 frame has a chip big enough to add real - time effects to video			1
gimmicky , but as we guess this is aimed at the teenage market , a nice feature			0
the @entity37 is the fitness @entity4 , too , and in this guise it makes another piece of hardware obsolete : the shoe - mounted @entity87 + dongle			2
the @entity37 comes with the @entity87 + software , with workout history , power songs and the like , but the accelerometer now works as a pedometer , counting your steps to flab - loss			2
you can also connect it to a @entity87 + @entity4 compatible cardio - machine via the dock connector			0
one mystery remains , though			0
why would @entity2 put an @entity100 into an @entity4 , something it has refused for almost ten years ? the answer comes with @entity103			2
in addition to live pausing of the radio stream ( and rewinding up to 15 minutes through the buffer ) you can tag tracks by hitting the center button			1
if a radio station supports it , the song info is saved and later you can see a list in @entity113 alongside , you guessed it , the option to buy the song			0
of course , the fact that the new @entity118 hd has an hd radio inside may also have influenced @entity2 's decision			0
so now i 'm torn			0
do i buy a new touch to replace my current model which has a loose headphone connection , or should i get the @entity37 , with its video camera and sport - friendly features ? if @entity2 had piled the features onto the @entity4 , the decision would be made , and @entity2 would have $ 400 of my money			1
as it is , i think i 'll wait			0

@entity2 upgraded its @entity11 with a video camera , not its @entity4
@entity37 's video camera is a direct *challenge* to @entity54 's tiny , no - zoom camcorder
nano has an @entity141 with live pausing , rewinding and ability to tag tracks in @entity113
perhaps @entity2 is putting the @entity4 on a two - year update plan like the @entity8
