-- turns out , i am mentally ill. aspects of my current brain chemistry resemble that of a person with obsessive - compulsive disorder			2
i have n't started turning the light switches on and off or urgently avoiding sidewalk cracks			2
but i have been shopping for beauty products and underwear in a fever			2
i spend an embarrassing amount of time looking at myself naked			2
my classic symptoms -- involuntary preoccupation , mood swings , emotional sensitivity , enhanced sensual awareness -- are what tip the diagnosis			2
in the throes of limerence			2
it is both a psychological and physiological state			2
it is also the state i wish to call home			0
@entity29 terms for limerence : romantic love , crazy love , lovesick , mad love , amour fort			1
you see a theme in the words crazy , sick , and mad			0
in this condition , one 's body drugs itself mightily with hormones that create a feeling of joy			1
the rapture is balanced with the panic and dread that it could end			0
@entity48 has a shelf life			1
by some estimates , you 're lucky to get 18 months			1
i 've had it for a year			1
when i think of becoming nonlimerent in six months , i suffer stomach pains , headaches , and jitters			1
" you wo n't have withdrawal symptoms , " says @entity59 , @entity60 , author of the groundbreaking 1979 book " @entity62 and @entity48 " and the woman who originated the term			1
" and 18 months sounds short to me			1
if the limerence is requited , it can last up to three years			0
but you wo n't wake up nonlimerent on your anniversary			0
it 's a gradual decline			1
" @entity0 : how to make romance last @entity74 , @entity60 , the author of " @entity75 , " gives it two years			0
" two , maybe three			0
during this stage , what i call infatuation , you experience increases of norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the brain and of testosterone , too , since lust is involved , " she says			1
" when you move into the attachment stage , where you see an increase of vasopressin and oxytocin , the other hormones return to normal			1
most couples in attached relationships have less sex than those in the infatuation stage			1
" the phrase addicted to love applies to women and men who crave the excitement ( and sex ) of infatuation , floating from one intense affair to the next , leaving a pile of heartbroken , attachment - seeking partners in their wake			1
once you 've transitioned out of infatuation , hormone levels dropping , you either attach or you do the opposite			1
" i do n't use the word detach in my research , " @entity74 says , " but that 's what happens			1
when you 're heartbroken , hormones change again			1
you get another dopamine boost			0
that makes you have no interest in food at the beginning and end of a passionate relationship			0
" @entity74 is wary of presenting a relationship time line by stages			0
" you can flow from infatuation to attachment and back again , " she says			1
" some relationships start with attachment -- a loving friendship -- and then shift to infatuation and lust			1
" the classic scenario , the only one i 've known , is to fall madly in love at the start and eventually settle into a pleasant commitment or suffer a devastating breakup			1
a comfortable marriage -- been there -- is swell			0
attachment is a relief , a safe haven			0
for most people , the ultimate reward			0
but i 'd rather not contemplate attachment or detachment when the stage i 'm in is , as @entity154 puts it , " the greatest joy , the height of euphoria , walking on air			1
" in my twenties i was always looking ahead , insisting that relationships move forward to be satisfying			0
my goal then was to progress to marriage			0
now , in my late thirties , i try to live in the present			0
my current goal : milk the glorious status quo			0
six to 12 months of it left			1
is there no way to stretch this out ? get more than the allotted couple of years ? @entity0 : how to find love and make it last " you know , limerence can be unending , " @entity59 says			1
" i 've interviewed subjects who 've nursed a fixation on their limerence objects -- @entity175 -- for decades			1
" what 's the trick ? " their feelings were unrequited , " she reports			1
" their @entity181 gave them mixed signals , like ignoring them for months and then calling			1
@entity185 , confusion , and uncertainty kept it going			0
the phenomenon is defined , in part , by feeling a loss of control			0
the limerent person ca n't stop thinking about the @entity194 : what did he mean by that ? how can i interpret his tone of voice ? how is he responding to me ? a prolonged fixation on someone who does n't love you back is considered , by some psychologists , a pathology called erotomania			1
" but that 's not me			1
" if the @entity194 is responsive , " @entity59 says , " like your boyfriend , he does n't send mixed signals , you do n't experience uncertainty , the love is mutual , and limerence declines			1
unless you want to start pretending you do n't have feelings for him , or playing hard to get , the end will come			1
and then some hope : " barriers and hurdles in the relationship lengthen infatuation , " @entity74 says			1
" for example , suppose one of you is married			0
or one lives in a different city			0
you say your boyfriend travels a lot for work ? that 's good			1
the pain of his leaving and the happiness of his return can prolong the stage			1
" that could buy me another six months			1
i explored other adversity options			0
i 've always been skilled at picking fights			1
" a fight can intensify the feeling , making you work harder to put things right , " @entity74 says			0
but beware : part of infatuation is the joy of discovery			1
as you learn about the object of your affection , the insights propel you to the next stage			1
if you love her more for who she really is , enter attachment			2
conversely , if she turns out to be a raving , provoking lunatic , detachment would be the wise choice			0
effect : subtract six months of infatuation either way			1
all pain , no gain			0
other factors that subtract from bliss time : chronic irritation , dissimilar interests and goals , sexual dysfunction , antipathy for each other 's friends and family , fear of loss of personal freedom and identity , surfacing of past relationship disappointments , inability to argue productively			2
that 's the shortlist ( and no wonder the prospect of moving beyond rapture is daunting -- there are so many bubble - puncturing issues )			2
the factor at the top of this list , @entity74 says , is " boredom , lack of novelty			0
you have to continually have adventures , do new things together			0
they do n't have to be grand or expensive			0
if you can keep introducing fresh experiences into the relationship , you can lengthen the duration of romantic love or , even better , have a burst of that old feeling within the attachment stage			1
" @entity0 : what to do when every little thing he does drives you crazy my boyfriend and i have loads of good , solid ideas for new things to do together			0
for instance , he wants to teach me about opera and classical music			0
every time we set out to listen , we wind up ignoring the plans and doing the same things we usually do , in the same place , every single night			0
" okay , let 's talk about sex , " @entity74 says			2
" i want to distinguish lust from infatuation			2
having lust does n't mean you 're in love			1
many couples start out with lust and then move into infatuation			2
you can certainly fall in love without sex			2
but falling in love triggers your sex drive			2
suddenly , everything your boyfriend does is sexually attractive			0
" you have high levels of dopamine in your brain , and you want it constantly			0
that may be what you 're most afraid of losing , why you want to arrest the infatuation stage			1
" i admit to nothing			0
" you do n't have to lose the desire			0
there are an enormous number of ways you can experiment sexually , and we live in a world where there is a wealth of easily accessible information on how to do that			0
" so internet porn might net me another few months of testosterone infusion ? naturally , i 'm willing to try anything			2
@entity74 also advocates prolonging infatuation by making improvements in your physical appearance			2
perhaps losing ten pounds and washing out my gray hairs will win me another year			0
combine that with my boyfriend 's frequent flying and our future novel adventures , and i 'm ratcheting up my limerence potential to a grand total of five years			2
the doctors did n't respond favorably to my math. " you know , some people are never limerent , " @entity59 says			0
" we do n't know why , but they ca n't or wo n't experience the feeling of being madly in love			1
" and for the majority of limerent subjects , the feeling is unrequited			0
they have a horrible time			0
" " leaving one stage is not an end , " @entity74 says			2
it 's a new beginning ? " my point is that relationships can be fluid			2
you can flow from one stage to another if you 're able to put energy and attention into the relationship , " she says			1
of course , you ca n't flow from detachment back to anything			0
i suppose you could break up and get back together , but then the love would n't have the same blissful optimism			2
and , @entity74 warns , putting too much effort into maintaining the status quo could cause problems ( and not the good " romantic struggle " kind )			0
@entity74 says that i should let the infatuation run its course and enjoy the hell out of it			2
who knows ? maybe when it ends , i 'll have had enough of it			0
i 'll report back , four years from now			0
