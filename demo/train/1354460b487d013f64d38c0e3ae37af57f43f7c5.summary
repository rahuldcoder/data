in his memoir , " @entity6 , " @entity0 chronicles his journey from " irreverent young drunk " to ultra-runner			0
the author sobered up by running five miles at a time , then 10 , then 50			0
it was @entity0 's editor who first suggested he write about his road to recovery			1
" i told him point - blank , ' no one wants to hear me cry about how i f * * * ed up my own life , ' " @entity0 said			0
" and i was totally wrong			0
" when " @entity6 " was published on @entity17 's @entity16 list in 2011 , it hit no. 1 , bumping @entity19 out of the top spot			1
the book 's popularity may have been a surprise to @entity0 , but experts know he 's not alone in using exercise to overcome addiction			1
groups have been popping up around the country to help people stay sober by staying active			1
" it 's a great way to introduce people into something that then later becomes ... sort of their coping mechanism , as opposed to picking up a drink or a drug , " said @entity31 , one of this year 's top 10 @entity32			1
@entity31 's nonprofit , @entity39 , provides free athletic activities and a sober support community to thousands of people in @entity43			1
in 2008 , the @entity44 pledged $ 4 million to research the effect of physical activity on drug use			1
preclinical research has provided evidence that exercise can help treat -- and even possibly prevent -- addiction , and now human trials are taking place			1
according to the @entity44 , abuse of illicit drugs and alcohol contributes to the death of more than 100,000 @entity57 every year			1
while intervention and treatment programs have improved , relapse rates range from 60 % to 90 % in the first year of sobriety , the institute said			1
" habits play an important role in our health , " the institute 's director , dr. @entity63 , said in a @entity66 newsletter			2
" understanding the biology of how we develop routines that may be harmful to us , and how to break those routines and embrace new ones , could help us change our lifestyles and adopt healthier behaviors			0
" psychology professor @entity76 researches the effects of exercise on addiction in laboratory rats			1
one of his first preclinical studies on the subject showed lab rats that had access to an exercise wheel in their cage were much less likely to self - administer cocaine than their sedentary counterparts			1
he and his colleagues have also completed several follow - up studies , duplicating the results with male and female rats ; with low , medium and high doses ; with heroin ; and with different models of substance binges and relapses			1
" i was amazed at how consistent the effects of exercise were , " @entity76 said			1
other researchers have published animal studies with similar results			2
for example , a 2009 study in @entity107 showed treadmill exercise reduced morphine use in male rats			2
and in 2011 , a study in the journal @entity114 demonstrated animals ' preference for saline over amphetamines when they exercised			0
" these results lead us to conclude that a previous practice of regular physical activity may help in preventing amphetamine addiction , " the study 's authors wrote			1
while evidence mounts that exercise may help prevent and treat addiction , scientists are trying to figure out why			1
to get clean , addicts often give up their past social lives , including any friends who use			0
during their recovery , they have a lot of free time and not a lot of support			2
exercise and sporting groups could help fill that void , said @entity140 , a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at @entity143 and director of addictions research at @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147			1
when @entity140 and his colleagues started their human study on exercise and alcohol abuse , they theorized that physical activity would reduce the depressive symptoms alcoholics often suffer from , thereby reducing the risk of a relapse			1
they asked one group of study participants to work out once a week with the rest of the group and to work out on their own another two to three days			2
at the end of a three - month follow - up , the researchers found the exercise group had fewer drinking days and fewer heavy - drinking days than a group that did n't exercise as regularly			1
what the researchers did n't expect was feedback from participants who said they enjoyed the structure that regular exercise provided to their lives			2
" they liked the fact that they were getting healthy and doing something for themselves , " @entity140 said			0
exercise provides a " high " that could be important for addicts trying to combat cravings , experts say			2
in addition to decreasing anxiety and stress , physical activity helps increase levels of dopamine in the brain			2
dopamine , a chemical that 's associated with feelings of pleasure , is often diminished over time by substance abuse			1
some researchers have hypothesized that addicts are simply replacing one addiction with another			2
@entity76 's response ? fantastic			2
" one of those addictions leads to basically a devastation throughout all aspects of your life and probably premature death , " he said			0
" the other addiction leads to improved cardiovascular health , better self - esteem , better self - efficacy and maybe some joint problems when you get older			2
it 's an apples - and - chain saws comparison			0
" @entity140 has more theories on why exercise may help addicts stay clean			0
in unrelated studies , exercise has been shown to regulate sleep , a common problem for addicts early in recovery			1
it can even improve cognitive function , something that 's often impaired by chronic substance abuse			1
" these are just hypothetical , " @entity140 said			0
" they need to be tested			0
" while scientists search for more answers , @entity0 said he is content knowing that running works to keep him sober , day in and day out			0
" for me , exercise is the opposite of alcohol , " he said			0
" alcohol is the easiest , fastest and most effective way of saying : ' i do n't care			0
i do n't care about the good things in life or life at all			0
' " exercise , especially for someone who has been a sedentary alcoholic for a long time , is brutally difficult			0
and , as such , it 's a very meaningful way of saying : ' ok , i actually do care now			0
i care enough about my life that i am willing to endure this torture to get better			0
' " doing the hard work of exercising totally reversed my worldview			0
i went from a life that was headed toward one thing to a life of nearly infinite potential			0

relapse rates for substance abuse range from 60 % to 90 % in the first year of sobriety
but preclinical studies show that exercise helps prevent and treat addiction
the @entity44 in 2008 pledged $ 4 million to research exercise 's effects
@entity265 @entity264 based his sober support group on exercise and sports
