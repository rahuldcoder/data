-- hosts @entity1 remain winless at the @entity2 after being held to a 0 - 0 draw by @entity4 in @entity5 on wednesday			1
the result left @entity8 's team second in @entity9 on two points , with @entity11 's @entity4 leading the way on four			1
striker @entity13 wasted a golden opportunity to give @entity4 all three points , but the 25 - year - old could only fire wide from 12 yards with the goal gaping			2
it was another frustrating result for two - time world champions @entity1 , after @entity1 could only draw 1 - 1 with @entity19 in their opening match			2
despite calling on attacking talents such as @entity23 winner @entity22 , @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity26 of @entity27 , @entity1 were unable to truly trouble @entity28 in the @entity4 goal			1
the home team 's night was summed up on 80 minutes , when @entity31 's @entity22 blazed a free kick 20 yards over the crossbar from the corner of the penalty area			0
a win for @entity19 in thursday 's other @entity9 clash against @entity38 will mean @entity1 have to secure three points in their final group game -- against @entity38 -- to stand any chance of progressing into the quarterfinals			1
" no one expected this kind of game , " @entity8 told the tournament 's official web site			0
" nothing comes out the way we expected			0
" we have a game against @entity38 , and we can have five points to qualify			0
we need to keep calm , think it is a final and come out with this mentality			0
" @entity8 , who was part of @entity1 's @entity56 winning squad in 1986 , also defended @entity22 , who has struggled to replicate his stunning club form for the national team			1
" he has no space because opponents know how to play and close in the defence			0

@entity1 could only *manage* a 0 - 0 draw against @entity4 in @entity65 in wednesday
@entity8 's side are second in @entity9 on two points
@entity1 face *potential* *elimination* from the tournament in the first round
