-- a cholera outbreak has erupted this summer in @entity2 , killing more than 600 people in the neighboring countries of @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity5 's @entity7 said more than 350 people have died since june and the infection threatens to spread to the entire country , the most populous in @entity2			1
in neighboring @entity6 , nearly 300 people have been killed			1
" there 's a lot of people crossing over the border all the time , " said dr. @entity12 , the leader of the @entity14 's global water sanitation and hygiene epidemiology team			0
" so it 's not surprising that the cholera is also crossing over the border			2
" @entity5 's outbreak had sickened more than 6,400 people and killed 352 people by wednesday , the federal @entity24 reported			1
" although most of the outbreaks occurred in the northwest and northeast zones , epidemiological evidence indicates that the entire country is at risk , " the ministry reported			1
cholera occurs in much of the country under normal conditions , but the lack of clean drinking water and recent flooding following heavy rains are fueling the spread of disease , the ministry reported			1
two - thirds of rural @entity5 lack access to safe drinking water , and fewer than 40 percent of the people in the affected states have access " to toilet facilities of any description , " the health ministry said			1
the intestinal infection causes diarrhea and vomiting that can cause severe dehydration without prompt attention , according to the @entity57			0
about 120,000 people die worldwide each year from cholera , and the disease can kill within hours if untreated , the @entity57 says			2
cholera is spread through water contaminated with human waste			2
" what puts people at risk is a lack of safe drinking water , " @entity12 said			2
boiling the water or treating it with chlorine or filtration or other ways to remove the contaminants can make it safe			0
untreated , cholera can kill within hours , @entity57 said			2
@entity12 said the @entity6 outbreak began in may and has exceeded 3,000 cases			1
under ideal conditions , cholera 's fatality rate ought to be less than 1 percent , he said			0
but @entity6 's conditions are not ideal			1
many people live far from the medical aid that could help them rehydrate and replace the sodium and potassium lost in their stools and vomit			0
" that delay can be critical , " @entity12 said			0
" if you do n't get the fluids and the electrolytes replaced through hydration , you can go into shock and die as a result			0
" the country 's northern region has been particularly hard hit			0
three of 10 prisoners diagnosed with cholera at @entity99 in the far north were among the dead , the officials said			0
@entity12 said the rugged and remote region has been affected repeatedly by cholera epidemics , most recently last year			0
about 70 percent of people living in the country 's far north , bordering @entity5 and @entity105 and the @entity106 , do not have access to potable water , according to a @entity110 official .			1
