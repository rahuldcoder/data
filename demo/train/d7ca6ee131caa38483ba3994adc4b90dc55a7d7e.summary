@entity0 -- when @entity4 got a surprise phone call from the @entity7 campaign one august afternoon , asking whether she 'd like to be on the @entity9 presidential ticket , the then - @entity3 governor did n't doubt for a moment she was ready for the challenge			1
" when i got the call , it was not such a shocking call to me , " @entity4 told talk - show host @entity12 in a highly anticipated interview that aired monday			1
" i felt quite confident in my abilities and my executive experience and i knew that this is an executive administrative job			0
i was happy to get in there and contribute			0
" nor was @entity4 deterred by the fact she had five kids at home , including an infant with special needs			1
" it never occurred to me that i could n't do the job because of children , " she said			0
" my children are my strength			0
... they allow me to be grounded			0
" but what did shock @entity4 was just how much the campaign knew about her and her family before she even formally met with sen. @entity7 to discuss the job			1
contrary to what was reported in the media , @entity4 said , she was extensively vetted , and the campaign knew exactly " who they were getting			1
" " after this vetting and the hours of discussion about the background , my record , my family , what i stand for ... i thought after all that i better confess it now , the one skeleton is in my closet , " @entity4 said			1
" i did get a @entity51 22 years ago in a college course			1
and i thought that was going to be the extent of the controversy in @entity4 's life			1
" one year later , @entity4 has seen more than her fair share of controversies but has emerged as one of the hottest @entity9 stars and is among the early leaders for the 2012 presidential nomination			1
her session with @entity12 came a day before her already - bestseller " @entity64 : an @entity71 " will hit bookstores and @entity4 will hit the road on a tour of some of @entity70 's most conservative corners			1
the book and concurrent publicity blitz have all the trappings of an early salvo in the upcoming race for the @entity77 , but @entity4 said 2012 is n't on her radar screen			1
" i am dealing with so many issues that are important ... and what i am finding , clearer and clearer every day , what i am seeing is that you do n't need a title to make a difference			2
" in the wide - ranging interview , few subject were left untouched , including @entity4 's early and frequent clashes with the senior ranks of the @entity7 campaign			1
in what was her initial introduction to the high stakes of presidential campaigning , @entity4 was blindsided by the fact that @entity7 aides knew that her then - 17 - year - old daughter @entity97 was pregnant , a fact that @entity4 had yet to disclose back in @entity3			1
" i was surprised that they knew			0
i was surprised , too , that we did n't handle that issue , that challenge better , " she said			0
" if we were given the allowance to deal with the issue in a more productive way , we could have perhaps sent a better message : this is not to be emulated			0
" she added , " i did not want that message sent out that we were giddy happy to become grandparents , and that 's what that message said			2
" for the newly minted vice presidential candidate , that was the first sign that she was in for a rocky road with @entity7 's campaign advisers			1
" i rewrote it , and couple hours later it scrolled across the screen			0
... there it is , the message i did n't want sent			0
just a little indication about problems to come about what i would be able to say and how i would be able to speak , or not speak , my heart and my values			0
" the handling of her daughter 's pregnancy was only the first of a string of frustrations for @entity4 over the course of the campaign , during which , she said , she and her family felt like they could n't be themselves			1
@entity4 said nowhere was this made more clear than when @entity7 advisers forced the family to completely overhaul their wardrobe when they touched down in @entity139 , @entity140 , for the @entity141 in early september 2008			1
" i though this was like one of those relationships you have , when you 're young , and somebody says , ' i just love you the way that you are ; now let me change you , ' " she said			0
another frustration was the campaign 's insistence that she grant repeated interviews to @entity153 anchor @entity152 , after it was exceedingly clear that they were not going well			1
" after the first segment , which did n't go well , i did n't do very well -- i was annoyed with her badgering of questions -- i was scheduled to do a second , then a third and then a fourth			0
... i know that there were hours of tape that were shot , and i would think that those few minutes that were edited together ... and shown to the @entity70 public , if people only know me from that interview , [ they would think ] that i was not qualified , " she said			2
but the ultimate showdown with @entity7 aides came on election night , @entity4 said , when she was prevented from delivering a concession speech before @entity7 took the stage			2
" i was disappointed that the explanation i was given that ... @entity176 candidates never give a speech on election night			0
that was false because i have seen it happen			0
in fact four years prior , of course , that had happened			2
" ultimately , however , @entity4 said she thinks that even if she had been allowed to be more herself on the campaign trail , it is likely the @entity9 presidential ticket would have lost			1
" the reason that we lost : the economy changed under a @entity9 administration , " @entity4 said			1
" people were sincerely looking for change			0
they were quite concerned about the road that @entity70 was on with its economy			2
they did not want more of the same			0
they did not want status quo			0
and i think , unfortunately , our ticket represented what was perceived as status quo			2
" but since the campaign came to end one year ago -- and with it @entity7 advisers ' influence over @entity4 -- she has become more controversial , especially after she abruptly resigned as @entity3 's governor over the summer			1
" i resigned as governor of @entity3 because i was n't going to run for a second term , and i was heading into a lame duck term , " @entity4 said of that decision , which shocked political observers			2
" we came back [ from the campaign ] to a new normal in @entity3			2
everything had so changed in my administration , " @entity4 continued			1
" there were so many opposition researchers up there in @entity3 that were sent , probably , by the @entity219 camp			0
... it was a point where my state of @entity3 was being hampered by my presence there			0
" ultimately though , @entity4 made clear the move was n't so much an end as it was a beginning			2
" my dad 's quote sums it up better than i sum it up , " she said			2
" ' she 's not retreating ; she 's reloading			0
' " @entity1 's @entity229 contributed to this report .			0
