-- nine days after her same - sex wedding , a 28 - year - old @entity2 woman was set upon on her way home from work , knocked unconscious by three men who kicked and punched her while shouting anti-gay epithets			1
" hey b --- - , are n't you that f --- -- from the news ? " one of the men asked , according to police			0
the assailants in monday 's assault recognized her from local tv news coverage of her wedding , said @entity22 , a spokesman for the @entity23			1
she and her partner were among the many gay and lesbian couples to recently make their unions official after a federal court struck down a @entity29 amendment restricting marriage to one man and one woman			1
the victim , who does n't want to be identified , got herself to a hospital with significant bruising and swelling to the right side of her face as well as her torso and arm , @entity22 said			0
police in @entity42 -- about 30 miles west of @entity43 -- were looking for the attackers			0
in many states , hate crime charges could be brought in such cases , but @entity29 is one of 19 states that do not include sexual orientation in their hate crime laws , according to @entity52 , state legislative director for the @entity54 - based @entity53 , a national lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender advocacy group			1
@entity29 's hate crime law , known as the ethnic intimidation statute , protects people against crimes based on their " race , color , religion , gender , or national origin			1
" but @entity29 prosecutors acknowledge the law is inadequate , and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( @entity70 ) advocates agree			2
" people on the other side of this issue tend to think of it as the @entity70 community looking for a special right , " said @entity73 , director of victim services for @entity29 , a statewide @entity70 anti-violence and advocacy organization			1
" it 's not a special right to walk down the street holding the hand of people you love and not be attacked			2
" for more than two decades , advocacy groups have been pushing for states to adopt hate crime laws to include the lgbt community or expand existing laws to do so , according to the @entity53			1
the laws would impose stricter sentences , increase accountability on assailants and broaden crimes to include hate crimes against property			2
the @entity54 was the first jurisdiction to include sexual orientation and gender identity in hate crime laws in 1989 , according to @entity52			1
in 2001 and 2002 , she said , advocates pushed for states to specifically protect the lgbt community in hate crime laws			1
the clamor was a direct response to the case of @entity109 , a gay teenager who died after being tied to a fence in @entity111 and beaten in 1998			0
in 2009 , president @entity112 signed into law @entity114 and @entity115 , making hate crimes a federal offense in an attempt to protect members of the nation 's @entity70 community and other groups from bias - motivated violence			1
advocates hailed the federal law 's passage as a step in the right direction , but legislators appear to have abandoned efforts to expand it on a state level			2
" legislators have it stuck in their head that because it 's a federal law , they do n't have to pass it on a state level , " @entity52 told @entity0			2
" but there is a limited number of money the feds have to investigate hate crimes			0
it is much more ideal for states to have mechanisms to take on hate crime themselves			1
" the first effort at expanding @entity29 's ethnic intimidation statute dates back to 1997 , according to @entity149 , press secretary for @entity29 state house speaker @entity150			1
but opponents have said that expanding the statute would make gays and lesbians a special class of citizens and signal that crimes against the lgbt community are more serious than those committed against heterosexuals , according to the state legislature 's @entity161			1
@entity163 , @entity29 's first openly gay state legislator , was the primary sponsor of the bill expansion in 2001			1
he said the opposition reflected a basic lack of education about gay rights , the philosophy that you should n't add an additional penalty to a crime , and the fact that some people did not want to give special recognition to the @entity70 community			2
" there are still glaring gaps in the laws that generally protect people , " said @entity163 , a former state representative who now heads an organization called the @entity179			1
" hate crimes , while they may be committed against an individual person , are aimed at the entire group of people they represent -- that 's why they are different than just a crime , " he said			2
" they are sending a message to a group of people			0
" @entity2 police officers are required to record data and report information for reported crimes , including whether sexual orientation was a factor , according to @entity52			0
but prosecutors ca n't bring charges beyond the actual assault			0
" the federal government ... wanted to see how much of a problem hate crimes were , " @entity52 said			0
" the difference was the government took the data and said it was a problem and changed the law			0
" @entity42 police say they do n't have any reason to believe the 28 - year - old @entity2 woman attacked on her way home is not credible			1
police have no leads at this time			0
she told police she believes the prior publicity contributed to the attack			0
the police investigation continues , and whatever evidence is gathered will be turned over to prosecutors			0
@entity223 , chief assistant prosecutor for @entity42 , said prosecutors could contact @entity226 attorneys if they determine that federal law is applicable			0
" if the motivation for the crime was a person 's sexual orientation , it just does n't fall within the ethnic intimidation statute , " he said			0
@entity234 added , " it is not an unheard - of situation for our office to contact the @entity226 attorney in appropriate circumstances to look at a particular case if federal law addresses a situation better than state law does			2
" @entity245 : government to recognize @entity2 gay marriages			0
