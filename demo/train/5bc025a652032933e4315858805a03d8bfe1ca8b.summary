-- it takes a special person to join @entity3			1
for one , the elite society only takes individuals with @entity7 scores in the 98th percentile , meaning just 1 in 50 @entity9 is eligible			2
this exclusivity -- some might say snobbery -- is part of @entity3 's lore			1
early @entity15 in @entity16 walked around with yellow buttons , organizational publications once referred to @entity20 members as " @entity21 , " and last year , a top @entity3 member and tester called anyone with an iq of 60 a " carrot			1
" in short , you do n't always join @entity3 because you think you 're smart			1
you join to be set apart from most people , who are , as one member put it : " mundane			1
" but a new partnership between @entity3 and online dating giant @entity32 offers a new , enticing reason to join the society of geniuses : true love			1
beginning this week , members of the brainiac group can connect through a separate , exclusive dating service called @entity40			1
in addition , @entity32 members can add a special @entity3 badge to their profiles , signaling a specific interest in connecting with a single person with a confirmed genius - level iq score			1
smart dating struggles @entity49 is one of those geniuses			1
the 55 - year - old @entity52 woman is an it project manager who graduated high school in three years , college in two - and - a - half and has a law degree from @entity58			2
" it 's been a long time , " she said about her dating life			1
" i went hermit - y for a quite a few years			2
i just did n't find anyone who 's been interesting enough			2
" @entity49 found she does not connect with people who are athletes or sports nuts , for example			2
" i 'm looking for people who are intellectually curious			2
and when all you 're talking about is sports teams and barbeques ... when you 're talking about physical traits and not existential philosophy , i 'm not going to get the vibe			1
" @entity49 admits this attitude can limit her relationship options			2
but one expert thinks the results could be much worse			2
@entity77 is the author of the @entity78 , and penned a 2009 article , " why the @entity81 people have the @entity82			0
" a @entity84 graduate , @entity77 said highly intellectual people can frequently feel " entitled " to love			1
and sometimes this means unwilling to make the compromises for a successful relationship			0
" @entity90 tends to be pretty one - dimensional			0
there 's no way to say if this person interacts well with others , " he said			0
" for a relationship , it matters more how that person implements that intelligence in the real world , for jobs and parenting and exchanging of ideas			0
" " you need to remove the barriers to love			2
and when you exclude those people , as smart people tend to do , that 's when you become lonely			2
" according to @entity40 's data , 80 % of singles say they " must have " or find it " very important " to be with someone of the same intelligence level			0
what your iq score does n't tell you @entity49 has decided a college education -- not a @entity7 -- is her basic requirement for a future mate			0
" i just want someone who can keep up with me , " she said			0
new possibilities the new @entity3 partnership will give @entity32 users a new way to find common ground , said @entity128 , a professor at the @entity129 and @entity32 's chief scientific adviser			1
" if you 're proud of being in @entity3 , if someone ( else ) is also proud of being in @entity3 , then you 're already in the same clan , " she said			1
" it 's not unlike saying i read a lot of books and i 'm looking for someone else who reads a lot of books			0
there 's an automatic filter			0
" in their announcement of the partnership , @entity3 and @entity32 included a heat map of the @entity9 , listing where the " smartest singles " live , based on the cities with the highest percentage of @entity150 graduates on the dating site			1
the top 10 is dominated by college towns such as @entity155 , @entity156 ; @entity157 , @entity158 ; @entity159 , @entity160 ; @entity161 , @entity162 ; and @entity163 , @entity164			0
@entity128 cites numerous studies that suggest relationships with a brainy mate could come with great perks			0
" people who are smarter tend to have a higher income , tend to be creative , coordinated , and good at solving problems , " she said			0
" so not only could you have a better conversation during dinner , but dinner could be in a nicer place , and ( you could ) leave in nicer car			0
" @entity77 does not believe @entity3 members are better at relationships than anyone else			1
but the partnership with @entity32 provides another way for people to find common interests , which is always positive , he said			1
" i think it 's a step in the right direction			0
" @entity49 hopes he is right , but she wo n't get too excited just yet			0
" one of the most recent marriages in our @entity3 group came through finding each other on @entity32 , and that was before the partnership , " she said			1
" i 'm hoping that it ( works )			0
i do n't know if it will			0
but you ca n't go anywhere if you do n't have hope			0
