@entity0 -- for the majority of people in the @entity5 banking is as easy as walking to a local branch or @entity7 , or logging into their account from a computer			0
but for millions in developing countries , even having a bank account is out of reach			0
in @entity15 , at least , that could be about to change			2
@entity16 and @entity17 , @entity15 's largest private bank , have launched @entity18 , a mobile - based money transfer and payment service that was first established in @entity21 in 2007			1
the partnership , announced in a news release april 17 , claims it will give mobile - banking access to some 700 million @entity15 people who are currently " unbanked " -- people with no access to conventional banking services like bank branches and atms			1
@entity16 says service will first rollout in @entity15 's eastern regions , including @entity32 and @entity33 , with 8,300 agents			1
that part of @entity15 is home to about 220 million people			0
service will eventually be extended across the rest of the country			0
the @entity18 system -- where " m " stands for mobile and " pesa " is the @entity45 word for money -- begins with real cash and an @entity18 agent			2
a customer signs up , registers a personal mobile phone number and deposits money into the linked account at an agent store , which could be a mobile phone shop , a gas station or a supermarket			2
to send money , the user inputs a recipient 's mobile phone number , the amount of money to send and a security code for protection			2
to withdraw funds , the receiver visits an @entity18 agent and requests a withdrawal through his or her mobile phone			1
both the receiver and the @entity18 agent then receive a confirmation for withdrawal , which instructs the agent to give the customer cash			0
bills can be paid and mobile talk time can also be bought through the platform			0
" for millions of people in @entity15 , a mobile phone is a bank account , a front door to a micro-business or a lifeline to people in the remotest areas , " said @entity76 , managing director and ceo of @entity16			1
" research shows that @entity18 brings real benefits to users in their daily lives , saving three hours a week of their time and around $ 3 in money transfer costs -- a significant amount to people in some areas			2
" greater cell phone penetration also brings greater economic benefit to local economies , often far removed from urban centers in large developing countries			0
a 2006 @entity101 study found that every 10 % increase in cell phone penetration grows the local economy by 0.6 %			0
in 2011 , @entity15 alone added 142 million new mobile phone subscriptions -- twice as many as in the whole of @entity106 , and more than in @entity107 , the @entity108 and the former @entity110 republics combined , according to the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) in a june 2012 report			1
between 2000 and 2011 , @entity15 recorded an enormous boom in cell phone subscriptions -- growing from just 3.5 million to more than 893 million			1
in that same time , @entity115 saw mobile phone subscriptions increase more than ten-fold to more than 986 million subscriptions			1
the @entity118 saw growth of just 87 % over the same dozen years to 290 million , says the @entity111 .			0

@entity18 was first established in @entity21 in 2007 as a way to transfer money and pay bills
