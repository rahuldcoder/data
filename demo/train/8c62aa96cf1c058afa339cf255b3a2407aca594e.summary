with 100 % of precincts reporting results , @entity0 can report that the @entity6 @entity5 @entity4 primary is headed for a june 24 runoff			1
sen. @entity8 and @entity9 will battle again after both candidates fell short of the 50 % threshold needed to avoid another contest			1
the race is a high - profile tea party vs. establishment showdown			1
for tea party supporters , it 's perhaps their best chance to claim victory after facing a string of defeats this year			1
tuesday marked the biggest single day of primary voting in 2014 , with contests in eight states			1
in @entity28 , the winner of that high - profile @entity27 @entity4 primary had rare support from both sides of the battle between conservatives and the establishment			1
if @entity5 can flip the @entity28 and five other @entity36 - held seats , they will regain control of the @entity4			1
and @entity38 used its new " jungle " primary system for the first time in a gubernatorial race			1
that 's where the top two finishers advance to the november election , regardless of party affiliation			1
with @entity36 gov. @entity48 the overwhelming favorite , the race was for second place , and a moderate @entity5 edged out a tea party - backed conservative state lawmaker			1
top takeaways from tuesday 's primaries @entity6 at 76 , @entity8 is the second - oldest @entity4 incumbent running for re-election			1
@entity9 , a state senator , ran on a platform of change , saying @entity8 , who has served in @entity58 for four decades , has been in @entity59 long enough			1
" we do n't have six more years of the status quo , " he recently told @entity0			0
" i am not going to @entity59 , to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals			0
i 'm going up there to fight and defend the @entity66			0
" @entity8 and @entity9 were separated by fewer than 1,400 votes with @entity9 slightly ahead , 49.5 % to 49 % , according to numbers compiled by @entity69			1
a third @entity5 candidate in the primary race , @entity70 , grabbed 1.5 % of the vote			1
so what happens next ? the two candidates have a little under three weeks before they go head to head again			0
runoffs usually have lower turnout and tend to favor challengers			0
money will be key as both dig deeper into their campaign war chests and rely on outside help from independent groups			0
@entity9 's campaign was already asking for more cash wednesday			1
" i 'm going to be brutally honest with you : our campaign is pretty low on money and there 's no way we can win if conservatives from around @entity6 and @entity94 do n't stand up and make sure we have the resources we need to win , " he said in an email blast			0
@entity96 , a national tea party group that backed @entity9 , pledged to " double down " on its efforts to make sure he wins			1
another conservative group , @entity101 , even called on @entity8 to drop out , but vowed to " vigorously pursue this race " in support of @entity9 no matter what			1
@entity8 supporters also say they 're ready for another round			2
@entity107 , who runs the @entity108 , told @entity0 's @entity109 that they 're " going to get up and rethink " their message			0
" really organize from the ground up , " he added			0
@entity107 said " complacency " among @entity8 voters " hurt us " and he thinks " they got outshouted			2
" his group dished out six figures to support @entity8 , who was also backed by the @entity94 @entity118 , which represents the interests of business			2
the chamber put out a statement in support of @entity8 on wednesday , but declined to specify if it will go up with another ad buy			2
another leading outside group that tends to support establishment candidates , @entity125 , said it would stay out of any runoff			0
@entity128 , a @entity8 adviser and former adviser to @entity130 , told bash that three weeks allows more time to scrutinize @entity9 's record and ask tough questions			1
the winner will face off against former rep. @entity135 , who @entity0 projects will be the @entity36 nominee , in november			0
nasty @entity4 race digs deeper in the mud @entity28 state sen. @entity140 did n't have to take sides in the battle between grass - roots conservatives and the @entity5 establishment : she had the backing of both , and she easily came out on top in a crowded primary race			1
@entity149 , a lieutenant colonel in the @entity150 who grabbed national attention by touting her hog castrating skills in a campaign commercial , had the support of some top names and groups among both the tea party movement and the mainstream @entity27			1
at her victory party tuesday night , @entity149 acknowledged and thanked her @entity27 competitors			2
" it is going to take all of us pulling together to unite this party and win in november , " she said			0
the race was originally a free - for - all between four major @entity27 candidates , but in the closing weeks of the campaign , @entity149 pulled ahead of her rivals			0
the big question going into primary day was whether she would top 35 %			2
if no candidate passed that threshold , the nomination would have been decided a week later by delegates at the @entity27 convention			0
but in the end , @entity149 won in a landslide			0
@entity149 will face off against @entity36 rep. @entity177 , who had no opposition for his party 's nomination			2
the winner of november 's general election will succeed longtime @entity36 sen. @entity183 , who is retiring at the end of the year			2
@entity5 believe they have a good shot at flipping @entity183 's seat			0
big - name republicans from both the establishment and conservative wings of the party , like @entity130 , @entity191 and @entity192 , joined @entity149 on the trail			2
she also grabbed support from the @entity118 and the @entity196 as well groups like the @entity198 , which often backs like - minded candidates who launch primary challenges against incumbent @entity5 senators			2
midterms : what 's at stake @entity38 gubernatorial race @entity48 and @entity5 @entity206 finished in first and second place , respectively , and will advance to the general election			1
@entity48 's first - place finish was never in doubt			0
@entity206 and fellow @entity5 @entity211 were vying for the second spot			0
some @entity27 strategists said they were concerned that if @entity211 , a conservative with tea party backing , had won , it could have hurt @entity5 candidates come november in down - ballot races in a state where the general election electorate is much more moderate			1
@entity206 , a moderate , was a @entity221 official under president @entity222			0
one time anti-war protester @entity223 was also on the ballot , the nominee of the @entity227 , a socialist party			2
she grabbed about 1 % of the vote			0
@entity229 became the face of the anti-iraq war movement in 2005 when she protested for weeks outside @entity222 's ranch in @entity233 , @entity234 , after her son @entity235 was killed in combat			0
