-- no guts no glory , or so the saying goes			0
but perhaps the vanquished @entity4 soccer team can rest in the knowledge that if the @entity6 was decided on guts , it would surely be lifting the trophy in @entity9			1
for 120 minutes of tuesday 's ultimately unsuccessful last - 16 clash with @entity11 , each one of @entity13 's men left everything on the field in @entity16			1
from the second the @entity4 went 2 - 0 down in extra time thanks to goals from @entity21 and @entity22 , the rearguard action started			1
substitute @entity24 's goal offered the nation a lifeline and energized its fatigued players with a quarter of an hour to play			1
and you could almost hear the sigh of despair from @entity31 to @entity32 as late chances for @entity34 and @entity35 were agonizingly spurned			0
the final whistle signaled tumult at either end of the emotional spectrum as @entity11 advanced to a quarterfinal with @entity41 on saturday and the @entity4 departed			1
beaten , yes , but not bowed			0
" it 's hard for us to end up on the losing side after 120 minutes of giving absolutely everything , " @entity13 told reporters			0
" but this game had everything , it was a thriller			0
we had chances to equalize , but congratulations to @entity11			2
" i 'm proud of the players not just for what they 've done tonight , but what they 've done throughout the tournament			0
they 've made the country proud			0
" with every passing minute of its participation in the @entity6 , the @entity4 had drawn soccer a little closer to its heart			1
and though its harrowing exit will cut deep , if ever there was a football match to ignite one nation 's passion for the beautiful game this was it			0
buoyed by progress from a tricky group , if the @entity4 thought @entity11 might represent a simpler prospect than @entity70 it took less than a minute to dispel that notion			1
the @entity74 poured forward like the @entity75 in the game 's fledgling stages as a pass from @entity21 , of @entity70 outfit @entity79 , sent teenager @entity80 scampering through on goal			1
his effort was powerfully struck but just like a succession of @entity70 players had found in their final group game , @entity82 was in parsimonious mood , and blocked with his legs			0
save for a clutch of enterprising moments in three successful group games , @entity11 had failed to live up to its pre-tournament tag of dark horse			2
but though the @entity95 bristled with intent during the opening exchanges , the @entity4 would not be cowed and created its first openings after 20 minutes			1
@entity35 narrowly failed to connect with a corner before a marauding run from @entity101 , son of former @entity103 coach @entity102 , presented the @entity105 star with a clear sight of goal			0
but just as @entity82 had in the opening minute , @entity11 's goalkeeper @entity108 was equal to the task			2
@entity110 proved brief though , as @entity11 resumed its front - foot role			1
@entity112 was twice involved as the @entity74 spurned a pair of chances in quick succession			0
first the defender , who plies his trade for @entity118 in the @entity119 , pinched the ball in midfield and fed @entity21 but he dragged a shot wide			2
then @entity123 profited down the left channel but hesitated momentarily before pulling the ball across the face of goal , allowing @entity128 to clear from inside his own six - yard box			1
the pattern continued after the interval , the @entity4 adopting a more open style than in its previous encounter but at the same time struggling to counter the pace and dynamism offered by @entity11			1
@entity136 again gave notice of his menace by glancing a header from a @entity142 cross onto the crossbar with @entity82 reduced to the role of spectator			0
despite being pinned inside its own half for long spells , the @entity4 remained a threat on the counter attack , and from one such downfield break @entity150 was inches away from connecting with a volley			2
@entity35 also tested @entity108 with two attempts from range but in the main , the red wave continued			0
@entity156 was the next man to try and pierce @entity4 's rearguard as he sauntered into the area -- defenders in white petrified of upending him -- before the ball ran loose to @entity136			2
yet again , @entity82 earned his stripes and made the block			0
the goalkeeper , a long standing servant of @entity165 club @entity164 , had @entity4 fans in raptures again moments later as he diverted another goalbound effort from club colleague @entity156 after he had sprung the offside trap			2
@entity136 stung @entity82 's palms with a rifled shot from outside the box before @entity173 rippled the side - netting as the pressure intensified with the end of normal time in sight			2
a measure of the attacking swarm @entity11 had adopted came with the sight of captain @entity182 picking the ball up in his own area and charging upfield to prompt @entity82 into another save , as his flick lurched for the bottom corner			2
deep in stoppage time , the moment the @entity4 had been waiting for arrived			1
a knockdown inside the area found substitute @entity193 eight yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat			0
a nation held its breath and then howled as he launched the ball over the crossbar			0
an incorrect offside flag from the linesman spared his blushes , as the crowd in @entity16 roared their approval at the conclusion of 90 minutes			1
for those recently converted to the joy of soccer it surely proved how thrilling a scoreless draw can be , but the deadlock was broken a matter of minutes into the added 30 - minute period			0
@entity21 played the role of destroyer , dancing away from three white shirts inside the area before angling a shot beyond the seemingly unimpeachable @entity82			0
when substitute @entity22 added a second 12 minutes later it appeared as if the game was up			1
but if anything , the @entity222 striker 's goal only served to inspire @entity13 's troops			0
chasing a lifeline , their game plan went out of the window , an all - out approach paying dividends when teenager @entity24 -- a controversial pre-tournament selection in place of @entity4 legend @entity233 -- volleyed home superbly to halve the deficit			1
from that point on , all hell broke loose			0
the @entity4 were nearly level within seconds of @entity24 's strike as @entity34 hooked a shot that dropped tortuously wide of the far post			1
then @entity22 squandered a chance to seal the tie once and for all , as @entity82 made his 14th save of the night -- the most in any @entity6 match since 1966			1
the final act of a game that will live long in the memory saw a neatly worked free kick send captain @entity35 in on goal but when it mattered most , @entity108 stood tall to make the block and repel the last effort the @entity4 could muster .			1

@entity11 finally ends @entity4 ' @entity6 dream with a 2 - 1 *victory* in @entity16
extra time goals from @entity21 and @entity22 seal the win
@entity24 pulls a goal back for @entity4 with 15 minutes left to offer hope
@entity11 will now face @entity41 in the quarterfinals on saturday
