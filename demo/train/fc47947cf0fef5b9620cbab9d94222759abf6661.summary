-- a sun - starved @entity2 town has finally seen the light -- by installing giant mirrors on the surrounding mountains to reflect rays onto its market square			1
the small town of @entity11 sits deep in the narrow @entity12 , in the @entity13 south - west of @entity15			1
the towering peaks that surround it rise to almost 2,000 meters above sea level and block out the sunlight for half the year , meaning @entity11 residents live in a permanent shadow from september to march			1
but all that changed this week , with the official launch of a project first mooted a century ago			1
three high - tech mirrors , with a combined reflective surface of 50 square meters , have been put into operation on a ridge on @entity31 mountain , brightening up the previously gloomy town center by flooding it with up to 600 square meters of sunlight			1
twenty - first century technology has made the $ 850,000 project possible , with heliostats -- computer - powered mirrors -- shifting every 10 seconds to track the movements of the sun during the day			1
but the idea to lighten up the dark town actually dates back 100 years			2
@entity11 was originally founded as a company town for @entity43 , which set up a fertilizer plant here to utilize the hydro power from the nearby 104 meter @entity48 waterfall			1
the story goes that the aluminum and renewable energy company 's founder , @entity51 , wanted a way to brighten up the existence of his shadowed laborers -- and also to make them work more effectively during the winter			2
the local newspaper published a suggestion by local bookkeeper @entity61 to use a mirror to reflect sunlight onto the town , and @entity51 picked up on the idea			1
technological limitations of the day meant the scheme never came to fruition , however , and instead northern @entity69 's first cable car ( known as @entity70 ) was built in 1928 to give @entity11 residents sunlight exposure at the top of the mountain			1
more : inside the cold heart of an @entity76 volcano and that was that -- until the sun mirror concept was revived nearly a century later in 2005 by local artist @entity79 , who raised the sponsorship funds ( mainly from @entity43 ) and interest in the project			1
@entity83 , a company that builds mirror systems for solar thermal power plants in hotter climes , was drafted in to install the mirrors on the mountain wall -- not an easy task			0
" there 's no road leading to the construction site , " says ceo @entity90			0
" you can hike there in an hour or so , but there was no alternative than to carry heavy equipment there by helicopter			0
" there was no way to get a heavy crane up there , so @entity90 had to improvise to maneuver the six - meter high mirrors into place			2
" we used ancient tools , such as tripods made from wood nine meters long which we could bend together			0
we lifted this modern equipment with technology that people used 100 years ago , and it worked really well			2
" as well as improving the vitamin d intake of residents , tourism officials hope that the sun mirrors will boost the city 's winter visitor numbers			1

" [ this week 's ] mirror reveal was something that has never happened before -- sun in the middle of @entity11			1
" it 's amazing and it gives the town a real draw in the winter time			1
most of tourism in the winter is focused on snow sports in the mountains and ice climbing in the local areas around us			0
the fact that people will come to town just to see if the sun is shining is fantastic			0
" @entity11 's mayor , @entity149 , agrees			2
" the sun mirror means a lot to @entity11 , both for tourism and for industry , which is our origin , " he says			2
" it 's a perfect combination of technology and art -- and of course it is a great welfare activity for the citizens of @entity11			1
" not that @entity11 is without its attractions already			0
as well as the cable car ( @entity70 ; +47 35 09 00 27 ) and the winter sports on @entity166 , the town is near the vast mountain plateau of @entity168 , good for hiking , cross-country skiing and reindeer spotting , among other activities			0
the area is also the location of the @entity175 sabotages made famous by the 1965 movie " @entity177			0
" @entity11 's industrial heritage is celebrated in the @entity179 , and could even see it earn @entity182 status by 2015 ( it 's currently on the ' nominated ' list )			2
thanks to a 100 - year old idea , visitors can also come for a spot of sunshine , too			0
getting there : @entity11 is a 2.5 hour coach journey from @entity191			0
coaches run five times a day			0

sitting in a sun - *deprived* *valley* , @entity11 installed mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the town 's square
idea *initially* born a century ago but was not realized *due* to the lack of technology at the time
local businesses hope new light will draw tourists to the town in winter
