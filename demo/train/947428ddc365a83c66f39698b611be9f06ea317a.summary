-- a cold morning mist hangs over row after row of deep purple grapes -- a scene ripe for thoughtful contemplation			2
just a few fields away a civil war ensues , and occasionally the sound of sirens punctuates the serene vineyard			1
in the @entity13 , two drastically different worlds exist side - by - side -- as dissimilar as water and wine			1
