-- international envoy @entity1 said tuesday he sees @entity2 as a factor in diplomatic efforts to forge peace in @entity6 , a stance not shared by the @entity8			1
" i think @entity2 can play a positive role , " @entity1 said during a news conference with @entity2 foreign minister @entity10 in @entity11			1
his remarks came a day after he met with @entity15 president @entity14 in @entity16			1
@entity1 said @entity14 agreed on " an approach " to ending the 16 months of bloodshed in his country			1
world powers have deplored @entity14 's government for its assaults against civilians			2
but the diplomatic wranglings , such as @entity1 's recent @entity26 meeting in @entity27 and the @entity8 and @entity28 - backed @entity6 initiative , have failed to stop the killings of thousands since march 2011			1
the opposition @entity31 recorded at least 68 deaths tuesday			1
the @entity34 and @entity35 special envoy to @entity6 , @entity1 is visiting leaders in the region to find ways to implement his six - point peace plan , an initiative that has yet to gain traction			1
@entity1 said he believes @entity2 can play a key role in helping end the violence in @entity6			1
@entity11 is a friend and ally of the @entity14 regime , but the @entity8 and other nations exploring peace moves in @entity6 have opposed @entity2 participation in the diplomacy			1
@entity52 spokesman @entity51 cited " @entity2 's destructive behavior in @entity6 , " a reference to its support for the government 's fierce offensive against its opponents			1
" we want them to stop that destructive behavior , " @entity51 told reporters monday			2
" and so , of course , @entity1 in @entity11 , to the extent that he can stress to the @entity2 the importance of cooperating with the plan , that 's a good thing			1
but we have n't seen signs of that either yet			0
" " if the @entity2 regime wants to stop giving direct material support to the @entity15 killing machine , then -- and play a constructive role -- we would welcome that			2
we 're not at that point yet			0
" @entity1 , however , says that " @entity2 has a role to play			1
" " here i am talking to @entity78 and seeking the support and cooperation of @entity2 in my efforts to resolve this conflict peacefully , " he said			2
asked about his meeting on monday with @entity14 , @entity1 said the two discussed efforts to end violence , but he did n't want to mention details until he talked with opposition leaders			1
@entity100 " made a suggestion of building an approach from the ground up in some of the districts where we have extreme violence -- to try and contain the violence in those districts and , step by step , build up and end the violence across the country			0
" peace moves have failed to get off the ground at the @entity34 and among @entity104 and @entity28 nations , despite world outrage over @entity6 's brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrations			2
" the political process is yet to begin , a political process that would bring all parties to the table			0
and this is one of the key points of the six - point plan , " @entity1 said			0
" and i think that the essence of the six - point plan is stopping the violence , releasing detainees , allowing humanitarian access -- which should be seen as a package , a package that if complemented will help create the environment and the conducive climate for political talks -- political talks between the @entity15 to determine their own political future			0
" @entity124 also supports an @entity2 role in @entity6			1
while members of the @entity127 , which includes the @entity8 , have called for an end to the violence and for @entity14 to step aside , efforts to adopt a resolution that would allow for aid to the rebels have been blocked by @entity124 and @entity134 , key @entity15 trade partners			2
@entity136 and @entity137 are strongly opposed to armed intervention , saying the outcome in @entity6 should be decided by its people			0
@entity124 , in fact , said it will not deliver new weapons to @entity6 as long as the situation in that country is unstable , an official at the body in charge of monitoring @entity124 's arms trade said monday , according to state media			2
it had been the longtime principal supplier of arms to @entity6 since the days when it was the @entity153			0
two @entity124 military transport ships were scheduled to transit through the @entity157 tuesday , on their way to their expected destination , the @entity15 port of @entity161 , a @entity8 official said			2
the ships -- the the @entity163 and @entity164 -- had been closely watched by @entity8 intelligence for the last several weeks while docked in the @entity167 port of @entity168			0
the @entity124 have said any weapons and personnel on board the ship are for reinforcement of the @entity161 facility			0
@entity1 went to @entity175 later tuesday for talks on @entity6 with @entity178 prime minister @entity177			1
as the conflict persists , @entity15 are fleeing to neighboring countries such as @entity178 and to safe places in their own country			0
there 's been a " significant increase " in the flight of refugees to @entity185 in the last two weeks and authorities are working on the development of large sites to accommodate them , @entity183 , head of the @entity34 refugee agency in @entity185 , told @entity0 tuesday			0
he said there are about 130,000 @entity15 in @entity185 but not all of them are refugees			0
he said about 50,000 need assistance , but authorities are concerned that the number will continue to grow			0
