-- as anti-american furor raged in the home of the @entity3 , the top @entity5 diplomat on friday sternly warned countries where the unrest has been most pronounced : stop the violence and seek justice against those attacking diplomatic missions , or else the @entity5 will			1
from @entity13 to @entity14 , thousands of @entity12 have taken to the streets in recent days			1
many have fumed over what secretary of state @entity17 described friday as an " awful internet video that we had nothing to do with " -- an inflammatory @entity22 film posted online this summer and publicized in recent days			2
the 14 - minute film trailer , which was privately produced in the @entity5 led by a man federal officials identified as @entity26 , mocks the @entity27 as a womanizer , child molester and ruthless killer			1

" reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts			1
and we will ... keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world			0
" the contrast between then and now was especially evident in @entity70 , birthplace of the @entity3			0
two years ago , the self - immolation of street vendor @entity86 set off popular unrest that soon led to the downfall of @entity70 's longtime leader , president @entity91 @entity90			0

a nearby @entity5 school was " unusable " after being badly damaged , @entity109 spokeswoman @entity108 said			2
two people were killed and more than 20 wounded , interim @entity70 president @entity112 said later friday on state - run tv			2
while asserting the anti-islam video that stirred outrage " can not be justified by claims of freedom of opinion and speech " ( and adding @entity70 plans to sue the filmmaker ) , @entity114 condemned the " irresponsible , unjustified acts of violence by protesters " who wrongly blamed the @entity5 government for the film			1
new details emerge about mystery filmmaker anti-american protests -- some peaceful , some violent -- were hardly confined to @entity70			0

the armed clashes injured at least four troops and an @entity171			0
the 1,500 - troop mission has supervised the security of the @entity35 - @entity175 peace treaty since 1979			0
-- in @entity179 's capital , @entity177 , protesters got inside the compound with @entity181 and @entity183 's embassies			2
they did not breach the @entity183 building , but some got into the @entity181 embassy and pulled down a @entity181 flag before police with tear gas forced them to retreat			0
at least two people died after being run over by a police vehicle , reported the state - run @entity193 news agency , calling their deaths " an accident			0
" fifty policemen were injured and protesters set a police car on fire , the report said , citing police forces			0
@entity5 vice president @entity203 later friday called his @entity179 counterpart , @entity204 , to " express his concern " and press @entity179 to protect diplomats and their facilities in the @entity210 nation			1
-- in @entity69 , police opened fire to stop protesters from reaching the @entity98 in @entity215 , eyewitnesses told @entity0			2
@entity69 government forces were sent in and , by late in the day , surrounded the @entity5 embassy compound , @entity108 said			1
-- @entity218 saw its first demonstrations friday			0

demonstrations were not unexpected : on thursday , the @entity272 and the @entity5 @entity273 warned there could be more violence " at home and abroad as the film continues to gain attention			1
" and days before violent protests tuesday in @entity35 , the @entity98 in @entity39 was warned by the @entity5 intelligence community of concerns about the anti-islam film that sparked the uproar , a @entity5 official told @entity0			1
the cable sent to the embassy did not mention a specific threat			0
it only warned about the existence of the online movie and the fact that it was gaining attention			0
@entity294 groups mad about early reports on @entity22 film @entity5 authorities have discounted as false a producer 's claims to news outlets that the filmmaker was an @entity175 who made the movie with financing from more than 100 @entity294 donors			1
@entity175 's government denies that the film 's maker is @entity175			0
despite the firm condemnation by @entity5 government officials , some in the @entity134 world -- especially those raised in regimes in which the government must authorize any film production -- can not accept that a movie like " @entity318 " can be produced without being sanctioned by @entity319 , said @entity321 scholar @entity320			1
" they 're projecting ... their experience , their understanding ( that ) somehow the @entity5 government is responsible for the actions of a right - wing fellow , " said @entity320 , a senior fellow at the @entity322 think thank			2
@entity330 's piece explaining dissent in @entity333 nations latest on the investigation into @entity5 ambassador 's killing sources tracking militant @entity161 groups in eastern @entity46 say the tuesday attack that killed ambassador @entity340 was most likely carried out by a pro-al @entity341			1
four people have been arrested in connection with the attack , although they were not directly tied to the killings , said @entity346 , the chief aide to @entity46 's prime minister			1
@entity346 did not release identities or detail the allegations against the four in custody			0
the evidence leading to the arrests was based partly on witnesses , but " mostly pictures that were taken around the compound at that time , " @entity46 prime minister @entity351 told @entity358 's @entity357			2
@entity359 , president of @entity46 's @entity360 , said he was " 100 % sure that ( the attack ) was preplanned , and it was carried out with the intention to inflict all this damage , all this havoc " -- including rocking relations between @entity46 and the @entity5			1
he called for " the international community " to help @entity46 security control militant groups behind such violence			2
contrary to @entity373 's assertion , @entity371 spokesman @entity370 said friday that @entity5 authorities know of " no actionable intelligence " that indicates the @entity49 attack " was planned or imminent			2
" what @entity134 nations ' leaders are saying -- and not -- about violence the @entity380 has asked its non-libyan staff to temporarily leave @entity49 and head to @entity252 as a " precautionary measure , " said @entity384 , head of the @entity385 in @entity46			2
and since tuesday 's assault , the @entity5 has announced it will fly unmanned drones over @entity46 and dispatch two warships carrying guided missiles -- the first of which has already arrived off the coast of @entity46			1
@entity393 teams have been dispatched to @entity46 as well as @entity69 and @entity179 to safeguard @entity5 diplomatic posts in those nations , according to @entity5 officials			1
" although these security forces are equipped for combat , these movements have been undertaken solely for the purpose of protecting @entity5 citizens and property			2
these security forces will remain in @entity46 and in @entity69 until the security situation becomes such that they are no longer needed , " @entity238 said			1
