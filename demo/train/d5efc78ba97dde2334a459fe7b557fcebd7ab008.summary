-- there are many unanswered questions about the motivations of the alleged @entity5 bombers , @entity6 and @entity7			1
but it is becoming increasingly clear that they were inspired by faith in a radical @entity12 ideology			1
@entity7 has told investigators that , among other things , he and his brother wanted to defend @entity16 , while @entity6 's social media accounts are replete with clips by extremist clerics			2
as the investigation continues to unravel the seeming paradox of how two apparently normal young men could commit acts of violence , classmates , neighbors and relatives of those who knew them have expressed surprise and disbelief			2
i have interviewed over the past seven years more than a hundred radical extremists , including numerous @entity32 and @entity34 members , and it appears the @entity7 brothers fit the profile of many young men who turn to radicalism			1
young men — and they are almost always between the ages of 16 and 30 — who convert to the radical @entity12 cause come from a variety of socioeconomic and family circumstances			1
before their conversion ( and even often after ) , to all outward appearances they resemble their peers and seem like any other young men			2
what changes them ? while their friends , the @entity53 , or clerics may provide the spark or ostensible reason for radicalization , almost all these young men have some kind of deep and often hidden personal crisis in their lives that propels them to seek the all - encompassing , comprehensive answers that the radical @entity12 ideology offers			1
this belief system can elevate lost individuals into a greater collective , convincing them that they are carrying out the will of @entity68 for their own glory and the redemption of @entity16 everywhere			0
imbued with that conviction , the young men believe they are serving the cause of @entity68 , performing good deeds in the world , and that their own lives suddenly have meaning			2
they consider themselves at last on the correct path in life			0
repeatedly in my interviews , the surface reasons these men joined the cause , such as perceived @entity86 hostility to @entity16 or the @entity86 involvement in @entity88 or @entity89 , often masked a personal sense of alienation and individual crisis that gripped their lives , from a failed love affair or family conflict to not being able to relate to their peers			1
the radical @entity16 cause provides the relief from their crisis			2
it serves as the easy outlet to unleash their demons			0
they can now achieve a greater glory			0
they can become overnight heroes , featured in the media , endowed with fame and celebrated among their small , closed circle — either online or among fellow believers			0
whether the @entity7 brothers were self - radicalized through the @entity53 or by other individuals in the @entity86 or overseas , they tapped into a belief system that feeds on vulnerable young men			1
it is this radical interpretation of @entity16 and its ideology — which demonizes nonbelievers and creates an exclusivist community — that poses an all too real danger and can not be defeated by force of arms alone			0
i met many young men who ended up leaving the radical movement			1
the reason each of them left centered on their own realization that @entity32 and others were engaged in corruption or deception and did not represent true @entity16			0
as we search for the most effective responses to @entity12 radicalism , we would do well to remember that the answers ultimately must come from those who follow the faith			0
the @entity86 can play a constructive role			0
the radical @entity12 cleric @entity141 , whose sermons can be found on the @entity53 , is still influential			2
@entity86 authorities killed @entity141 with a drone strike in @entity145 in 2011			0
if the @entity86 put in effort to expose the fact that the cleric had been arrested for soliciting prostitutes -- a violation of @entity16 precepts -- his standing among young men looking for an example of @entity16 could be diminished			1
ideas drive the radical @entity12 movement			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0
