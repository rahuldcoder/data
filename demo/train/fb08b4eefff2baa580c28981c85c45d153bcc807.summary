-- @entity2 coach @entity1 has tried to lift the burden of expectation off his young team by claiming that wednesday 's semifinal opponents @entity7 are favorites to win the @entity9			1
the @entity10 , who came into the tournament missing several key injured players , have been tipped to win a fourth title in @entity14 after demolishing @entity15 4 - 0 in the quarterfinals and successfully shackling the attacking talents of @entity18			2
but @entity1 , whose team were beaten by the @entity20 in the final of @entity22 , believes that the last - four clash in @entity24 will be a more difficult proposition			1
" @entity7 remain the natural @entity9 favorites			1
they not only have one @entity18 , but they have several @entity31 , " he told reporters			0
" they have a whole range of players that can win a game , so we will have to be very watchful against them			2
they are a team that make very few mistakes			0
we have to force them into making mistakes			0
" the @entity10 are the top scorers in this year 's tournament , having racked up 13 goals in five games after putting four past @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity15			1
defeat in the second group game against @entity50 has been the only lapse , as @entity52 has reveled in his new central midfield role in the absence of injured captain @entity55 , while four - goal @entity56 and playmaker @entity58 have also been inspirational			0
@entity56 will miss the @entity7 game due to suspension but @entity1 has another potent goal threat in striker @entity62 , who needs one more to join @entity65 legend @entity64 on the all - time record of 15			1
" in 2008 , there is no doubt that @entity7 were the best team at the tournament			1
they have shown great consistency and always played at the highest possible level			0
so they have been impressive , " @entity1 said			2
" but now the situation is different			0
we too have a good team and we have every reason to believe that we can succeed			0
" @entity7 reached the @entity9 semifinals for the first time with a 1 - 0 victory over @entity82 thanks to a late winner from striker @entity84 , the tournament 's top scorer on five goals			1
defender @entity87 has backed his team to take the next step up			2
" i think when you are at the semifinal stage , there are no favorites , " he told reporters			2
" we never have any doubts about ourselves			0
we always play the same way , the results are good and we have to be confident with our play			2
" @entity2 and @entity7 both have new players in the team and it will be a different game to two years ago			1
we will always keep going			0
that is the sort of team we are			0
" @entity87 's defensive partner @entity104 has been cleared to play after suffering blurred vision when he was hit in the face by the ball against @entity82 , while midfielder @entity108 will also be available despite falling heavily on his shoulder			1
coach @entity110 has been under pressure from @entity20 media to drop striker @entity113 , who has failed to impress after having a pre-tournament knee operation			0
@entity113 , who scored the winner in the final of @entity22 , has been substituted in each of the past four matches after starting the shock defeat by @entity119 on the bench .			1
