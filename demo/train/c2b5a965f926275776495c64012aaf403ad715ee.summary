@entity1 prime minister @entity0 says @entity5 nations should " ratchet up the sanctions " on @entity3 rather than go through with a proposal for a nuclear agreement that he calls an " extremely bad deal			1
" @entity0 , in an interview with @entity12 chief political correspondent @entity11 that aired sunday on " @entity13 , " said easing sanctions would take off the financial pressure that could one day cause @entity3 to " cease and desist " from its controversial nuclear program			1
" @entity3 is really on the ropes , their economy is ... close to paralysis , and all of a sudden , you take off the pressure , everybody will understand that you 're heading south , " he said			2
@entity0 said @entity3 only gives minor concessions in the proposed deal and will keep the capacity for making nuclear weapons			1
he said he is hopeful for a far better deal			0
the way to get that is not to reduce sanctions , he said			0
" i think they should not only keep up the pressure , i think you should increase the pressure , because it 's finally working , " he said			2
" and if you give it up now , when you have that pressure , and @entity3 does n't even take apart , dismantle one centrifuge , what leverage will you have when you ease the pressure ? " the @entity43 and other nations are " getting close " to an interim deal with @entity3 that would prevent its nuclear program " from advancing , and roll it back " in key areas , a senior @entity43 administration official told @entity12 on friday			1
@entity0 will meet this week with leaders from @entity49 , @entity50 and the @entity43 to urge them to hold out for a better deal			1
@entity0 said @entity43 secretary of state @entity52 will visit @entity1 on friday , but the @entity54 said the trip has yet to be confirmed			1
@entity0 met sunday with @entity49 president @entity56 and is scheduled to visit @entity50 president @entity57 in @entity58 on wednesday			2
" i would like to make it clear that there can be disagreements even among the best of friends , certainly on issues related to our future and our fate , " @entity0 said sunday at the start of @entity1 's weekly @entity61 meeting			1
" i hope that we will succeed in convincing our friends this week and in the days afterwards to achieve a much better agreement			0
" @entity50 says now is time to make deal with @entity3 on nuclear program " if you do a bad deal , you may get to the point where your only option is a military option , " he told @entity11			1
" so , a bad deal actually can lead you to exactly the place you do n't want to be			1
i think if you want a peaceful solution as i do , then the right thing to do is ratchet up the sanctions			0
" @entity43 secretary of defense @entity88 , in an exclusive interview with @entity12 @entity87 correspondent @entity86 , said saturday night the @entity43 is " listening carefully " to @entity1			1
he reiterated that @entity90 is continuing its longtime strategy to ensure that @entity3 can not gain the capability of building nuclear weapons			1
he said the @entity43 is considering different options to accomplish that goal			2
but he said it would be irresponsible if the two sides in the negotiations did n't pursue diplomatic engagement while considering @entity1 's concerns			1
" what we have been trying to do , and are doing , is working through these difficult issues , " he said saturday at the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103			0
" we think that there is some possibility ( of an agreement ) -- although we 're very clear - eyed on this			0
we understand every danger and dimension of what @entity3 represents to @entity1 and us , and our other partners in the @entity115			1
" @entity116 said the @entity43 -- and @entity3 -- understand that there is the possibility of a military strike from a potentially isolated @entity1			1
" we would never tell @entity1 , or any country , a sovereign nation , an ally , a very close partner and friend as @entity1 is , that they ca n't do something , " he said			2
" they will do whatever they think is necessary to defend their own interest			0
" during the forum , which brought together defense experts and lawmakers , @entity116 said the @entity43 wo n't sign a bad deal			1
" this administration is not going to try to force something that does n't fit to get a deal			0
we wo n't do that , " he said			0
" the stakes are too high for our country and for the world			0
" there was plenty of skepticism at the forum about the proposed agreement with @entity3			0
much of that skepticism was led by key democrats , including @entity116 's predecessor , @entity152			0
he was concerned about what will happen with the already enriched nuclear fuel , with thousands of centrifuges , with a heavy water reactor under construction in @entity159 , @entity3			2
" and how of all of this going to be inspected and verified ? " @entity152 said to @entity12			0
@entity162 's @entity161 makes 11th hour push for @entity115 contracts is trust enough when it comes to @entity3 ? the powerful chairman of the @entity168 said no. " i love the slogan ' @entity170 but verify , ' but i 've never understood it			1
because i think the right slogan is ' do n't trust , ' " sen. @entity171 said during the panel discussion			0
" i do n't trust the @entity3 -- and by the way , they do n't trust us			2
" the proposal covers every aspect of @entity3 's nuclear program , including uranium enrichment , uranium stockpiles and all nuclear facilities including military ones , the senior @entity43 administration official told @entity12 on friday			1
the deal will be on the table during the next round of talks in @entity188 , @entity189 , that begin wednesday evening			0
@entity3 has always maintained that its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes			2
even though @entity3 has denied working toward nuclear weapons , it has said it will not submit to any plan that would totally eliminate its nuclear program			2
the @entity195 's nuclear watchdog , the @entity196 , has found some modest progress			0
@entity3 has halted the installation of new advanced centrifuges , which are quicker at generating highly enriched uranium , according to an @entity196 report			0
@entity3 has support from @entity50 , whose foreign minister said saturday on @entity50 tv that the opportunity to bring about an end to a decade - long standoff must not be passed up			0
" our common impression is that there is a very good chance now which should not be missed , " @entity209 said in remarks broadcast on state - run tvc			0
the @entity43 , along with the four other permanent members of the @entity216 and @entity217 -- known as the @entity218 -- came close to a deal during recent talks with @entity3 in @entity188 , but the discussions ended with each side blaming the other for the lack of an agreement			1
@entity3 diplomacy underscores @entity228 's search for legacy			2
