@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 did n't think that selling chicken , pork and chili cheese tamales would buy her a one - way ticket out of the country			1
@entity10 is a @entity12 , @entity1 , woman who the media is calling " the tamale lady			1
" a 46 - year - old single mother of two and illegal immigrant , @entity10 faces deportation by the @entity19 administration			1
so what 's the problem ? are n't illegal immigrants supposed to be deported ? sure			2
but there are rules to the game , and the administration keeps breaking them			1
this case undermines the claim that the immigration crackdown is targeting hardened criminals			1
@entity10 ' trouble started on june 28 when she was arrested outside a @entity34 by @entity36 's deputies and charged with trespassing and interfering with a business			2
what exactly was the interference ? @entity10 is unemployed			2
she was selling tamales so she could buy food and clothes for her two children -- 10 - year - old @entity46 and 7 - year - old @entity47 , both of whom were born in the @entity50			1
news : young immigrants prepare for new @entity50 deportation policy think about it			1
this woman was n't holding a handmade sign that read : " will work for food			0
" she was working by making food and selling it			2
@entity10 says that she was a familiar presence in the parking lot , and that her customers included @entity34 employees			0
on this day , she was asked to leave , by a security guard and a sheriff 's deputy			0
she did leave , but she returned when she saw other vendors outside the store			0
suspecting @entity10 was in the country illegally , the sheriff 's deputies handcuffed the mother and placed her children in a squad car and drove them to the sheriff 's station			0
then they called @entity74 , which put a " hold " on her that resulted in her being locked up in the county jail for nearly two weeks without a lawyer			0
when @entity74 agents finally visited the jail , they determined she was in fact in the country illegally and took her into custody and put her children in foster care while she was being detained			0
now @entity10 is awaiting deportation			2
really ? handcuffing her for trespassing ? holding a woman for nearly two weeks without a lawyer ? what were these people thinking ? news : breaking down the @entity98 decision on @entity100 's immigration law all for selling tamales			1
some will insist that @entity10 is actually being punished for coming into the @entity50 illegally			0
but this woman only came to the attention of federal authorities because local law enforcement officers arrested her for an infraction that would have normally resulted in a slap on the wrist			2
and the reason that she was arrested was because she was selling tamales			1
judging from media reports , some people in @entity12 agree that the feds are overdoing it , and say that local cops ought not be accomplices			1
but , for many others , the conversation stopped when they heard @entity10 was living in the country illegally -- perhaps for as long as 20 years			0
they think she got what she deserved			0
what kind of immigration policy does @entity50 deserve ? the presidential candidates offer a choice : hands off , or all thumbs			2
@entity129 mock @entity131 's claim that , if jobs dry up , illegal immigrants will " self deport " and take their children with them			0
the @entity19 administration likes to give the impression that it has a more humane approach			1
instead of illegal immigrants voluntarily taking their children to their home countries with them , the kids are seized by authorities and given to other people through the foster care system			0
when it comes to immigration , @entity19 is a bully			1
he 's trying to build support with conservatives and organized labor by deporting as many illegal immigrants as possible , nearly 1.5 million since taking office			1
the administration accomplished this feat by arm - twisting localities and states into participating in a dreadful program called @entity157			2
it requires that local law enforcement submit to federal authorities the fingerprints of people they arrest who they suspect are in the country illegally			0
@entity166 : ' illegal immigrant ' is the uncomfortable truth guess whom those local cops , many of whom have no training in the enforcement of immigration law , often suspect ? @entity175			1
in fact , last year , a report by @entity181 's chief justice @entity179 confirmed that @entity157 disproportionately targets @entity175			0
the law enforcement partnership was initially marketed as voluntary -- until states like @entity185 and @entity186 tried to opt out , and then suddenly it became mandatory			0
it was also supposed to concentrate only on violent criminals -- until we learned that it also ensnared scores of folks without criminal records such as gardeners , housekeepers , nannies , traffic violators -- and yes , tamale vendors			2
recently , a group of three national immigration advocacy groups claimed to have found evidence that , in @entity1 , @entity157 is n't just reserved for violent criminals			2
under the @entity204 , the groups obtained e-mails between the @entity206 and the state of @entity1 that allegedly show that the program has resulted in the deportation of people who have never been arrested			1
@entity166 : how @entity100 law hurts @entity213 citizens this being an election year , president @entity19 is trying to downplay the deportations and convince @entity218 voters that his administration has become more lenient			1
in june , @entity19 himself announced what was billed as a major policy change at the @entity223 where so - called @entity224 who met certain qualifications would be spared deportation and issued work permits			1
to qualify , candidates had to be under age 31 , have come to the @entity50 before age 16 , have lived here for at least five years , have no criminal record , and either be in school , a high school graduate , or a military veteran			0
@entity10 does n't meet all those qualifications			0
@entity19 's @entity218 defenders buy the line that this is a kinder and gentler administration			1
they 'll buy anything to keep from admitting that they made a mistake in 2008 and helped put in office the most anti-immigrant president in a half century			0
@entity166 : for immigrants and opponents , court 's ruling hits their real lives but on the ground , in immigrant communities , they know better			1
they know that it is business as usual			0
and they can point to the miscarriages of justice that prove it			0
just ask the tamale lady			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			1

@entity3 was arrested after selling tamales near a @entity263 in @entity12
@entity166 says her potential deportation is a case study of policy gone wrong
he says @entity19 *adminstration* has used mass deportations as a tool to gain support
@entity166 : administration should do as it says , focus on deporting hardened criminals
