violence in the streets of @entity1			0
reading the grim headlines out of @entity6 , it 's easy to forget how we even got to this point			1
here 's a refresher course to get you up to speed			0
overview the @entity6 regime , led by president @entity14 , launched a violent crackdown last year on activists demanding more economic prosperity , political freedom and civil liberties			1
this sparked a nationwide uprising and eventually a civil war with armed rebels , many of whom defected from the military			1
as of july , the conflict had claimed an estimated 17,000 lives , mostly civilians , according to the @entity30			0
and more than 170,000 people have fled the @entity33 nation to seek refuge in neighboring countries such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			0
throughout the uprising , the @entity6 government has referred to the opposition as terrorists trying to destabilize the country			1
opposition leaders say that 's just the regime 's way of justifying attacks			2
@entity50 president @entity49 and many other global leaders have called on @entity14 to give up the power his family has held since 1970			1
they 've also imposed economic sanctions on @entity6 as they try to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis			0
how it started in january 2011 , revolution in @entity60 marked the start of the so - called @entity62			1
@entity60 's successful uprising inspired similar unrest in countries throughout @entity66 and the @entity33 -- countries that , like @entity60 , were experiencing high unemployment , corruption and political repression under longtime autocratic leaders			1
in march 2011 , violence broke out in @entity72 , @entity6 , after a group of children and teenagers were arrested for writing political graffiti			2
dozens of people were killed when security forces cracked down on protesters			0
demonstrators soon called for @entity14 to leave office , following in the footsteps of @entity84 's @entity83 and @entity60 's @entity86 @entity85			2
@entity87 promised to make changes , and he lifted the country 's state - of - emergency law , which for 48 years gave the regime the power to detain anyone without charge and hold them indefinitely			1
but just four days after the emergency law was lifted in april 2011 , the @entity6 regime sent thousands of troops into @entity72 for a wide - scale crackdown , witnesses said			1
since then , the violence has only increased , spreading throughout the country and becoming a full - fledged civil war between the regime and an armed resistance			1
by the summer of 2012 , the clashes had reached @entity1 , @entity6 's capital , and @entity108 , its largest city			1
timeline : from uprising to civil war who is @entity14 ? @entity14 has been president since his father , @entity113 , died in 2000			1
@entity113 ruled @entity6 for nearly 30 years and was supposed to be succeeded by oldest son @entity114 , but @entity114 died in a car crash in 1994			0
when @entity14 took office at the age of 34 , @entity117 nations had hopes that he might be more moderate than his father , a hard - line @entity122 ally			2
@entity14 , young and @entity117 - educated , was at one time studying in @entity123 to become an eye doctor			2
the @entity125 is @entity126 , a @entity128 offshoot that 's one of the minorities in a country that is nearly three - quarters @entity132			2
@entity14 has filled key positions in his government with extended family members , and many of his supporters are @entity126 and other minorities who fear what might happen if the @entity132 were to gain power			0
will @entity6 's first lady take a stand or stand by her man ? who are the rebels ? the opposition has become larger , more organized and better armed since the start of the uprising			1
many of the fighters are ex-soldiers who defected from the military , but there are also civilians who have taken up the fight against the @entity14 regime			0
" i go to war for my family , for my country , " said @entity156 , a 23 - year - old volunteer in the @entity157			2
" because ( @entity14 ) has killed everyone			2
" the @entity157 , the primary opposition group , emerged in july 2011 , claiming responsibility for an attack on an air intelligence base			0
it is not the only militia opposing @entity14 , however , and there are questions about how unified the opposition truly is			0
@entity173 inside @entity6 : faces of the @entity157 overall , the rebels have showed that they can effectively attack the regime			2
but it has been unable to hold major cities for long , frequently retreating under the pressure of a powerful @entity6 military that is better equipped and has airstrike capabilities			0
outside intervention the @entity50 and many of its @entity117 allies have imposed economic sanctions against @entity6 , condemning @entity14 and demanding that he leave power			1
but they have not persuaded the @entity187 to do the same			0
@entity188 and @entity189 -- two of @entity6 's commercial partners -- have vetoed several proposed resolutions on @entity6			1
without international consensus , most countries have been hesitant to intervene militarily			0
@entity196 and @entity197 , two @entity132 - led countries in the @entity33 , are believed to be sending arms to the opposition			0
but the @entity50 is providing only non-lethal aid and humanitarian assistance			0
on the other side , @entity202 is supporting @entity14 and the @entity6 regime , as is @entity206 - based @entity205 , another @entity128 ally			1
what 's at stake for @entity6 's neighbors the @entity30 , through former secretary - general @entity211 , proposed a peace plan this year and sent a team of observers into the country to observe a cease - fire that was supposed to go into effect			1
but violence persisted , the observers were withdrawn , and @entity211 resigned his post as special envoy			0
why @entity6 matters of course , there is the humanitarian crisis , with people dying , starving and in need of aid			0
the @entity30 says the violence has made it difficult for many @entity6 to access food , water , electricity and medical supplies , forcing tens of thousands to flee the country			1
but @entity6 's key role in the heart of the @entity33 means there might also be long - term geopolitical consequences at stake			1
many analysts see the conflict as a proxy war between @entity202 and its @entity132 @entity243 rivals in the region , between @entity202 and the @entity50 , and even between the @entity50 and @entity189 -- the latter " about who is going to have more say in the future of the region and on what terms the international community will intervene in conflicts such as @entity6 , " said @entity245 , chief executive of @entity246			2
why @entity50 should care about @entity6 because the @entity6 regime is @entity126 and the majority of the country is @entity132 , there is also concern that @entity6 could devolve , like @entity36 once did , into a bloody , sectarian battle that could further destabilize the region			1
and any time you talk about instability in the @entity33 , there are worries about @entity265 and other hard - line militants filling any power vacuums or failed states			0
then there is the @entity243 - @entity271 issue to consider			0
@entity6 has been a key @entity273 ally through the years , actively supporting @entity274 and @entity205 while sharing a border with @entity271			0
what will the @entity6 outcome mean for @entity33 peace ? as @entity279 , the former @entity50 diplomat , once said , " the arabs ca n't make war without @entity84 , and they ca n't make peace without @entity6			2

@entity6 's uprising , which started in early 2011 , has turned into a full - fledged civil war
thousands of @entity6 have been killed , and many more have fled the country
global leaders are calling for president @entity14 to step down
@entity87 says the rebels are terrorists who want to destabilize the country
