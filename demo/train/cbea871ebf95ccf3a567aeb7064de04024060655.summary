-- the lack of definitive information about the fate of @entity4 has baffled and riveted expert and average person alike			1
even the promise of @entity9 satellite images capturing the location of crash debris turned out to be false , as @entity13 authorities said a search of the area found nothing			1
amid the muddle of speculation , possibilities and blind alleys , are there logical explanations in this mysterious disappearance ? the short answer is yes			2
but what , of what we know so far , makes sense exactly ? first , the focus on the airplane 's transponders , the device that transmits a discreet signal to @entity34 ( @entity34 ) radars , might be misguided			1
the 777 has two transponders			2
a failure of one would send a caution message visible to the crew			2
they would then select the alternate transponder with barely a second thought			2
a double failure ? not likely , unless there was a serious electronic systems failure ( more on that later )			2
the only other plausible explanation would have been that the crew moved the knob to the off position			2
no professional flight crew would knowingly turn off a transponder in flight			2
it is also possible the airplane flew out of @entity34 radar range by navigational error			1
or as part of its assigned route , @entity13 370 might have participated in a well - defined procedure for nonradar environments			1
opinion : conspiracy theories build around disappearance the @entity66 track system between @entity67 and @entity68 is a good example of an area where such a procedure would be used			2
airplanes entering the tracks are required to fly at assigned altitudes and air speeds , separated laterally and vertically			0
pilots verbally report set latitude and longitude positions on their cleared flight plans to a ground - based service called @entity81			0
the nonradar traffic picture is calculated by a computer , based on these position reports			0
in an airplane as sophisticated as a 777 , the on - board computer can generate these reports automatically without verbal communication from the pilots			1
it is possible that on a portion of @entity13 370 's route , this procedure may have been utilized			1
if the airplane deviated from its assigned route because of an emergency , no problem would be indicated until the next reporting point because of the lack of @entity34 radar coverage			1
the crew would have to communicate the problem to the ground - based facility			0
the 777 is one of the most advanced electronic airplanes built			0
data is constantly being processed and transmitted to regulate internal systems , from flight controls to fuel systems and hundreds more			1
much of this data is being transmitted automatically to the airline			0
this data is used for dispatch computations and maintenance , among other uses			0
only a very rare major electrical and electronic failure would prevent this information from being transmitted			1
information regarding altitude , airspeed and heading is always available			1
any irregularities in just these parameters alone would indicate a problem			0
was the airplane descending rapidly ? did the heading change indicate a course reversal ? did the airspeed increase indicate a dive ? it 's possible @entity129 experienced a malfunction in the receiving system -- doubtful , but it would help if the airline made that information available			1
for argument 's sake , let 's say a major mechanical failure occurred			0
the crew might have been preoccupied with a serious problem as they progressed through the appropriate electronic checklist			0
a mayday call might not have been first on their agenda			0
all pilots are taught to " aviate , navigate and communicate , " in that order			0
could the mechanical problem have been serious enough for the crew to have lost control of the airplane before a distress signal was sent ? opinion : how did stolen passports get through ? although remote , consider the possibility of a fuel tank explosion			1
for the flight time to @entity159 , the center tank would most likely have been empty except for residual fuel as a matter of 777 procedure			1
the main wing tanks would have sufficient fuel for the trip			2
could a short that caused a spark within a fuel boost pump have ignited the trapped vapor within the center tank ? the @entity171 attributes the explosion of @entity173 off @entity174 in 1996 to this cause			1
that accident involved a 747 and not a 777			0
@entity177 recommended both a mechanical and procedural modification for the potential , but not totally verified , problem for many @entity177 airplanes			0
airlines began the modifications within two years after the investigation was complete			0
did @entity129 comply with the modification ? now that the @entity9 satellite image led nowhere , perhaps the rather chaotic search should be conducted over land			1
a different route may have been chosen if the crew had actually made the decision to return or divert elsewhere			0
regardless , a debris field will be found			1
and if the airplane just fell out of the sky , it did n't happen as a result of only one factor			1
all accidents involve multiple factors			0
let 's keep the speculation in perspective			0
the accident investigation process can be tedious , if not arduous			0
but the process is well - organized , especially in the @entity205 ; the @entity171 's participation will be of tremendous assistance			0
airplanes do n't just disappear			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			1

@entity211 : the lack of information regarding the fate of @entity13 370 is baffling
@entity217 : although remote , consider the possibility of a fuel tank explosion
he says no debris field has been located in the ocean , time to search land
@entity217 : if the airplane just fell out of the sky , it did n't happen as a result of only one factor
