-- so much for @entity1 ? facebook on thursday launched a photo - sharing app called @entity4 , which aims to make it simpler for the social network 's users to upload and browse photos on smartphones			1
the news comes only weeks after @entity2 spent $ 1 billion on a similar photo - sharing app called @entity1			1
and only days after the company 's initial public offering got a lukewarm reception from @entity15 and raised the eyebrows of financial regulators			0
the company says the app , which will be available late thursday for @entity21 devices , makes @entity2 photos more fun and accessible			1
" when you launch the app , you 'll see a feed of just great photos from the people you care about , " the company said in a press release			0
" you can swipe to see more of any album or tap to enlarge an individual photo			0
" the app lets users crop photos and add colorful filters			1
and people who use the app also can upload multiple pictures at once			0
" just select the shots you want to share by tapping the check - mark on each photo and then hit post , " @entity2 's statement says			2
" you 'll have a chance to add a caption , say where you were and tag friends before you share			0
" the app gets generally good marks from early reviewers , who say it is much faster than the primary @entity2 app and displays photos in a large , crisp fashion			2
but the comparisons to @entity1 are confounding tech bloggers , who are trying to figure out to what degree @entity2 was influenced by the company it purchased			1
@entity58 , a writer at the blog @entity60 , calls the app " @entity62 , " since the release comes so closely on the heels of the company 's purchase of that startup			0
while there are key similarities between the apps , he writes , @entity2 " was most likely working on this product long before buying @entity1 was ever a real possibility			2
" the @entity74 blog also says the similarities between the apps could be overstated			0
" it might seem strange for @entity2 to release a camera application with built - in filters just weeks after announcing plans to buy @entity1 , the social photo app , " the @entity77 writes			1
" but @entity4 is aimed at a different audience			0
@entity1 has 40 million users , while @entity2 has 900 million			1
this leaves a large swath of people who are not on @entity1 but are actively taking photos and uploading them to @entity2			1
the filters in @entity4 were developed by @entity2 and are not borrowed from @entity1			1
" at the blog @entity90 , @entity89 writes that @entity4 was " clearly influenced by it [ @entity1 ]			0
once the @entity1 deal does close , we expect the lines to blur even more , " he says			2
@entity97 , writing for @entity96 , had a more critical take : " had the @entity1 deal never occurred , @entity4 would n't really be much of an @entity1 competitor anyway , lacking any mobile - only social circles , hashtagged sharing around specific topics , tilt - shift , and interesting filters , for that matter , " he wrote .			0

@entity2 launches a ' camera ' app on thursday
the app lets users edit , filter and share photos
it is being compared to @entity1 , which @entity2 recently purchased
bloggers say the app was developed before that $ 1 billion deal
