@entity1 's face lights up with a smile that spreads like a sunrise across her face			1
she 's just arrived at a party , organized by the small @entity9 community on @entity10			1
it 's the first time she 's seen many of her new friends since being discharged from hospital last week			1
they raise paper cups of soda in a toast and @entity1 bashfully takes the salute and laughs and jokes with her fellow @entity9			1
it 's heart - warming to see her finally enjoying herself			1
all her @entity9 friends here had been lured to @entity28 by promises of lucrative work			2
but no one we know of has suffered quite like @entity1			2
one friend @entity33 tells me that on hearing @entity1 's story he burst into tears			1
@entity1 's unbelievably awful story of torture at the hands of colonel @entity41 's daughter - in - law @entity40 has touched people around the world and resulted in some $ 40,000 being donated to a special fund for her recovery			1
we found @entity1 abandoned in a @entity41 family compound in august			1
lying alone on a mattress on the floor , she told me how @entity51 and one of her staff poured boiling water over her head and body , simply because she 'd been unable to stop one of the @entity41 children from crying			1
offers of help poured into @entity61 and resulted in her evacuation to the tiny @entity64 nation of @entity10			2
she arrived here in september and has undergone surgery and skin grafts since then			0
now though , surgeons are satisfied enough with her progress to allow her to become an outpatient			0
she 's staying at a small apartment on the island and is receiving some financial help from the @entity76 government , which has helped bankroll the @entity28 revolution and arm its fighters			1
@entity1 's life here is not ideal though			1
she yearns to see her family , but red - tape has slowed down efforts to bring her relatives to @entity10			1
@entity1 says she does n't feel ready physically or emotionally to return to @entity9 and be subjected to the scrutiny of people in her hometown			1
she remains profoundly self - conscious of her appearance			2
but the doctors and nurses treating her at the @entity93 hospital are pleased with her recovery			0
nurse @entity95 has been treating her since she arrived			0
we watched as she delicately trimmed the growing crown of hair on her scalp			0
it 's growing back fast but for now it must be kept short , in order to prevent infection			0
nurse @entity95 says : " she is making very good progress			0
it was discharging before now it 's getting drier and drier			0
but now it 's good , very good , she feels it 's good anyway			0
" the consultant in charge of her case , @entity112 , says : " ms. @entity1 had regular physiotherapy for mobilization of her limbs especially the right shoulder which showed signs of early contractures due to immobility from the burns that she had sustained			2
" she also had the support of our psychologists in helping her to get over the horrific trauma that she had sustained			0
in both aspects she did very well			0
" in general , ms. @entity1 is more confident and communicating well with the medical and nursing staff			2
" it 's encouraging that her hair is growing back in places on her head			0
but the hair follicles towards the front , where the skin graft was performed , seem to have been permanently killed off			0
the doctors hope there are enough towards the back to enable her to grow her hair out and disguise the scars			0
i ask @entity1 about @entity51 and she speaks rapidly and with conviction			2
she hopes the former dictator 's daughter - in - law will one day be caught and prosecuted			1
but like her husband @entity145 , @entity40 's whereabouts remains unknown			0
victims like @entity1 are still waiting for justice .			2

a nanny left *disfigured* by the @entity41 family has left hospital in @entity10
@entity1 still faces almost daily hospital *appointments*
she was burned with boiling water by @entity158 's daughter - in - law because she was unable to stop a child crying
@entity1 gave thanks to the people who helped *pay* for her treatment and get her out of @entity28
