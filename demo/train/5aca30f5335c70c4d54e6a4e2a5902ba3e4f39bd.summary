-- @entity1 continued his fine scoring run with two more vital goals to keep @entity4 in title contention on saturday , while @entity6 moved into the top half of the table			1
veteran @entity9 international @entity1 has enjoyed a renaissance of his club career since moving to the @entity14 capital , and made it eight @entity15 goals this season as @entity4 scraped a 3 - 2 win at bottom side @entity18			1
the victory lifted the @entity22 side into second place above @entity24 and @entity25 , who play @entity27 and @entity28 respectively on sunday			0
it left @entity4 a point adrift of unbeaten @entity31 , who visit the @entity33 on monday to take on city rivals @entity34			0
despite his exploits for @entity9 , for whom he has scored 14 goals at three @entity38 , @entity1 was a fringe figure at @entity40 before his contract expired in july			2
but the 33 - year - old will be a key senior figure at next year 's @entity45 finals after scoring nine goals in the qualifiers and taking his international tally to 63 -- five behind @entity51 's @entity50 record -- when he netted as captain in the friendly victory over the @entity54 last month			2
@entity1 leveled for @entity4 from close range in the 28th minute after @entity56 put @entity18 ahead from the penalty spot , and then set up @entity58 two minutes after halftime			1
@entity18 had picked up only eight points from 13 matches , but looked like adding to that when @entity63 equalized on the hour			0
however , @entity1 stole the victory for @entity4 with three minutes to play when he found space to glance in a header from a cross by @entity70 forward @entity69			0
@entity6 bounced back from last weekend 's home defeat by @entity25 with a 2 - 0 win against @entity73 at the @entity74 that lifted @entity76 's team into ninth place			1
striker @entity78 netted the opening goal against his former club four minutes before halftime , pouncing for his second league goal this season after a mistake by @entity85 allowed him space to hook the ball past keeper @entity88			0
@entity73 will also rue @entity90 's goal four minutes after the break , as @entity93 's attempted clearance ricocheted off the @entity95 fullback and into the net			0
@entity6 , who went through to the knockout stage of the @entity99 as group winners despite wednesday 's defeat at @entity102 , have the chance to move further up the table in tuesday 's trip to @entity106			2
sixth - placed @entity107 remained behind @entity108 on goal difference after suffering a shock 1 - 0 home defeat by second - bottom @entity112			1
@entity114 striker @entity113 put the visitors ahead in the 63rd minute , and @entity107 's young @entity117 defender @entity116 was sent off for his second booking soon after			0
@entity106 moved up to seventh with a 2 - 0 win at @entity120 , as captain @entity121 and @entity117 striker @entity122 scored in the second half .			1

@entity4 beat @entity18 3 - 2 to go second in @entity125 's @entity15 as @entity1 nets twice
veteran @entity9 striker takes his tally of league goals to eight this season
@entity6 move into ninth place with 2 - 0 win at home to @entity73
sixth - placed @entity107 suffering a shock 1 - 0 home defeat by second - bottom @entity112
