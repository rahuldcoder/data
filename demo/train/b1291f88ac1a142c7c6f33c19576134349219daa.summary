after a careful review of all relevant research worldwide , the @entity2 government 's leading analyst of weight data just confirmed what i 've long known : being fat might not be a death sentence			1
that this study reported in the @entity11 seems at all shocking is a measure of the intensity and pervasiveness of weight prejudice in our society and in our sciences			0
another recent study found people who were " metabolically healthy " and overweight or obese had no higher death risk than metabolically healthy " normal " weight people			1
i take an interest in the topic because i 'm fat and because i do n't have a death wish			2
i 'm also interested because , like so many fat people , i 've encountered weight discrimination when i seek routine medical care			1
i was 26 years old when i was denied the right to purchase health insurance			2
i had no significant history of illness or injury			0
that day , i became a fat rights activist			2
being overweight linked to lower risk of mortality in the intervening years , i 've heard from so many people who fear for their lives when they encounter weight discrimination in our health care system			1
as a fat activist , i help as much as i can , but i 'm no federal agency			2
one woman called in the middle of the night , hoping i knew of an mri she could use for an important test			0
the machine at her local hospital , which she 'd used before , was being guarded by a technician who strictly enforced the weight limits			0
the tray that slides in and out of the machine could break			0
instead , she was denied potentially life - saving information in a crisis			0
how many of the deaths blamed on weight are actually caused by medical equipment -- everything from blood pressure cuffs to surgical instruments -- that fails to accommodate fat people when we need it most ? i 'll never forget the teenage girl who was told by a nurse practitioner that her complaint would go away once she lost weight			1
luckily , she had the nerve and the parental backup to get another appointment and the prescription necessary to treat her condition			0
how many of the deaths blamed on fat actually happen when people are diagnosed as fat instead of being diagnosed and treated for an illness ? then there are the fat people who did everything their doctors recommended to lose weight ... and died from dangerous diet drugs , from starvation diets , from mutilating weight - loss surgeries			1
i also hear from many people who live with the devastating physical and psychological consequences of such weight - loss attempts			2
some of these stories are referred to as anecdata , meaning they do n't count unless they 're counted in research -- although there are plenty of studies to support these outcomes			0
even so , i believe it still makes a difference when we tell our stories of weight discrimination and its damaging impact on our health			0
living : ' @entity107 ' bloggers find beauty in all sizes people are telling their stories of weight bias in medical care on websites like @entity115 , this is @entity117 and @entity118			2
the @entity119 has been speaking out on behalf of fat people 's civil rights since its founding in 1969			1
health professionals of good conscience are joining this effort in increasing numbers			0
they 've developed an approach called @entity128 that is proving to be better for people 's health than weight - loss attempts			1
the @entity128 professional organization , @entity132 , this week launched the project resolved , a response to @entity137 's weight - loss resolutions			0
it invites people to share stories about weight discrimination in health care and opinions about what needs to change			1
weight bias has been documented among doctors , nurses , fitness instructors and other professionals on whom a fat person might need to rely for help			2
last year , researchers who themselves are part of an anti- " obesity " institution ( @entity155 's @entity154 ) surveyed medical professionals who specialize in caring for fat people and found that they had high levels of weight bias , viewing us as " lazy , stupid , and worthless			1
" these biases do n't improve medical care			0
two pioneers of the @entity128 approach , psychologist @entity165 and health promotion expert @entity166 , analyze existing data to point out that using @entity169 as a proxy for metabolic health mislabels 51 % of healthy people as unhealthy			1
meanwhile , 23.5 % of the thin people with risky indicators will not be screened or treated early because they " look " healthy			0
in the medical literature , every time fat people prove to be healthier or to live longer than thin people , researchers call that result an " obesity paradox			1
" i 'd call their refusal to view fat people positively a form of prejudice			1
here 's a finding from the recent research that did n't make the headlines : for people over 65 , being fat was n't associated with increased risk , not even for the fattest old people			2
when do most people die , in our increasingly long - lived society ? over age 65 , perhaps ? living : are we really ready to take a look at ' real women ' ? i also learned this week that a highly accurate way to predict a person 's risk of dying is to see how easily they can get up from the floor			0
i 'm trying to imagine how different our health care system would be if , instead of focusing on weight and weight loss , caregivers did the sitting - rising test instead			1
how much healthier would we be ? how much more would we actually enjoy healthy living , free from weight judgment ? how much time and money would we save ? how much discrimination and human tragedy could we avoid ? i 'm guessing it 'd be tons .			0

@entity219 : study confirms fat is not a death sentence , and overweight people live longer
@entity219 denied health *coverage* because of her size ; she became an activist afterward
@entity219 : fat people *continually* get *misdiagnosed* , receive poor health care because of bias
@entity219 : doctors finding new @entity128 approach provides better care
