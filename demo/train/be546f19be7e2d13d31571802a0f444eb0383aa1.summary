@entity0 , whose clever , anarchic comedy on such programs as " @entity3 " and " @entity4 " helped define the 1950s " @entity5 , " has died			1
a friend of the family , actor @entity6 , did not know the exact cause of death , but said @entity0 had respiratory problems and other health problems for several years			1
@entity0 became famous for " @entity3 , " which went on the air in 1950			1
it lasted four years and was followed by " @entity4 , " which combined sketches , musical revues and situation comedy			1
both shows featured writers who became famous in their own right , including @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			2
@entity27 also contributed to @entity0 's comedy as a writer for one of his specials			1
@entity23 visited @entity0 last night to say goodbye , @entity6 told @entity32			2
" @entity0 was a giant - maybe the best comedian who ever practiced the trade & i was privileged to be one of his writers & one of his friends , " @entity23 tweeted wednesday			2
share your memories of @entity0 @entity0 also appeared in a number of films , including " it 's a @entity44 , @entity44 , @entity44 , @entity45 " ( 1963 ) , " @entity46 " ( 1974 ) and " @entity47 " ( 1978 )			1
he received a @entity49 nomination for his performance in the 1962 show " @entity52 , " with a book by @entity21			2
@entity0 , born @entity0 in 1922 , was part of a pioneering group of personalities who helped establish television in its early days			1
however , while comedians such as @entity59 and @entity60 more or less transferred their radio shows to the new medium and @entity64 's " @entity63 " was essentially vaudeville on the small screen , @entity0 's " @entity71 " presented movie parodies , wordless pantomimes and brisk routines between the host and co-star @entity70			1
" @entity0 was a giant			2
if it were n't for @entity0 there might not be television as we know it			1
he and his co-stars and writers revolutionized television comedy , and really comedy in general , " said biographer @entity77 , a close friend of @entity0			1
it was comedy pitched at a high ( or , just as often , low ) level -- and it was done live , every saturday night at 9			2
the versatile @entity0 was game for whatever the writers came up with			2
" @entity0 could take on many roles , " wrote @entity87 and @entity88 in the reference " the @entity90 to @entity91 and @entity92 , " calling him a " comic genius			2
" " he was the double - talking foreigner ( he was a master of dialects ) , the henpecked husband or the greasy - haired cad			0

@entity22 and @entity103 -- later @entity104 on " the @entity105 " -- were frequent supporting players			0
" we 've lost the greatest , monologist , pantomimic , sketch comedian tv has ever known ! @entity110 is oft misused but not so here			0
@entity111 , " tweeted @entity22			0
the high - pressure hijinks of the writers ' room inspired a number of other works , including " the @entity117 , " created by @entity22 ; the 1982 film " @entity119 , " produced by @entity23 ; and the 1993 play " @entity120 , " by @entity21			0
" when we came in , we did n't have the slightest idea of what we were going to do			0
we christened the beginning of the week ' bloody monday ' because we walked into the room with no material			0
we had three days to pitch lines and ideas and create six complete sketches , " @entity0 recalled in a 2011 interview			0
the high pressure also led to a drinking and drug problem for @entity0			0
it took him years to kick the habit , until finally he went blank one day while performing on stage in 1977			2
he checked into a hospital soon after and got clean			0
" i could n't stand me , " he said in 2011			0
" that 's why i drank and took pills			2
i could n't stand to be around me			0
" " @entity3 " lasted just four years , but its impact was such that a best - of selection was turned into a 1973 movie , " @entity144			1
" @entity0 followed " @entity3 " with " @entity4 , " which included @entity22 and @entity103 but not @entity70			1

he did a number of his own stunt gags and hurt his back in the process			0
he appeared in films by his former writer @entity23 , including 1976 's " @entity165 " and 1981 's " @entity166 , " and popped up in films such as " @entity168 " and " @entity47 " ( as coach @entity169 ) and " @entity170 " he hosted " @entity178 " in 1983 and was named an honorary member of the " not ready for @entity172 " at the conclusion of the show -- the only non- " snl " cast member to earn the tribute			1
