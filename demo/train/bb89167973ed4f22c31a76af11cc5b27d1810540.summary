-- in 1991 , @entity1 changed @entity3 rock music with an album that featured a naked baby on the cover			1
@entity7 played in bands for 18 years and says @entity10 's legacy always stuck with him			1
now , that naked baby is 17 years old and a high school graduate			0
the album , " nevermind , " is a classic beloved by music aficionados across the world			0
it soared to the top of the @entity18 , swiftly ending the ' 80s era of dance pop and " hair metal " and replacing it with the " grunge " movement			1
in doing so , it irreversibly changed the tastes and even lives of millions of musicians and music lovers			0
" one song changed the way we look at rock music , " said @entity28 of " @entity29 , " the first track on the record			2
" just like the @entity37 changed pop music 30 years prior , @entity1 's breakthrough album achieved the same level of power in terms of changing pop music			1
they were n't singing anymore about happy , funny songs			0
they were taking a real dark turn to pop music , and it changed everything			0
back then it was really different to hear that on the radio			0
it opened up a floodgate of artists that might never have been heard before that			2
" what artists , exactly ? @entity28 says @entity58 comes to mind , and that the entire emo genre might never have come into existence if it was n't for grunge			2
" it would n't have the visibility it has today without the stepping - stone that grunge gave it , " he said			2
ireport.com : passing grunge onto the next generation @entity71 said grunge also was crucial to indie rock becoming mainstream			1
" what i appreciate ' nevermind ' the most for was paving the way for other indie bands that i really ended up liking to get put out into the mainstream			2
not so much for the exposure they got , but so that everyone could more readily get their product , " he said			0
" it was a world without @entity85 , @entity86 or @entity87			0
the only way you got exposure to music that was n't pop [ or ] country was living close enough to a university - run radio station or having a friend who had access to it			0
it was n't long after the grunge era started that other indie rock bands like @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and a wealth of others broke out and started becoming a bit more accessible			1
" ireport.com : ' a lot of bands owe a lot to that record ' for @entity114 , the influence of @entity1 is a little more personal			1
hearing " nevermind " and the band 's other albums inspired him to learn guitar as a teenager , and he still plays in a band called @entity121			0
" @entity1 taught me to play music , " said @entity122			1
" everybody has the first few songs they ever learn to play , and for me it was mostly this @entity1 stuff			1
when i hear this album or think of it , i recall the countless afternoons i spent playing these songs on guitar and , later , drums			0
i remember learning every song on it , and pretty much every other @entity1 song			1
" @entity122 said @entity1 front man and songwriter @entity10 was an important influence in his life , musically and otherwise			1
" @entity10 was one of my earliest and greatest musical influences , as i 'm sure countless others can attest to			1
and he 's a tremendous influence on me in a lot of different ways , " he said			0
" when @entity10 died , i felt like i 'd lost a personal friend , even though i did n't know him and i was only 14 at the time			1
it was sort of like , here you go , here 's adulthood			0
" ireport.com : ' my teenage years would have been considerably less bearable were it not for this band ' @entity10 was also a profound figure in @entity7 's life			1
@entity7 played in bands for 18 years , and he said @entity10 's success on the charts and ultimate suicide led him to heed the @entity1 front man 's advice : " be careful what you wish for			1
" " these words were the fuel for the angst i needed to ' kill it ' on stage and give everything i had to just flat out rocking , " @entity7 said			1
" that meant no record deals , no big crowds , no bitching at the sound man because i could n't hear the vocals in the monitor , no perfect intonation , no perfect pitch , and if i blew out my voice ... bonus ! these words left me not wanting , but left me satisfied that i played that bar gig to 10 or 20 people like it was my last			0
in a way i felt like i did it for @entity10			1
i did it because i knew how badly he wanted to go back to those days of being a nobody and getting booed off the stage , or duct taping gear together and saying ... we can just make noise , vent our angst and throw all regard for approval out the window			0
" ireport.com : ' @entity10 will always be an icon for indie musicians ' of course , not everybody enjoyed " @entity200 " or the grunge movement it popularized			1
take @entity202 , for example			0
he agreed that " @entity200 " was a turning point in music , but for him , the turn was for the worse			0
" thanks for ending the greatest era of music ever , " he wrote in his @entity196 submission			2
" the onslaught of grunge killed off the best music			2
the ' 80s brought such incredible talent and songs that no other decade or era could match			2
" @entity202 said he does n't think the grunge movement could compete with styles like glam rock and 1980s dance pop in terms of musicianship			1
" @entity1 was not exactly the most musically talented band			1
then again , they did n't really need to be , " he said			0
" grunge as a music form was n't about technical prowess and did n't need to sound good			2
" @entity196 : ' their music was bland and depressing ' @entity229 , who called the record " the pinnacle of my music heaven , " said that opinions of " @entity200 " and the grunge movement are probably just a reflection of the different generations			0
" i truly believe that @entity1 , its predecessors and like bands of that time will forever be thought , to me , to be the best and most influential music of my life , " she said			2
" i know that everyone who loves music can say that about the music of their prime			0
so , i guess i would agree with others who would say that @entity1 was great for many and meant nothing to others ; it 's just a matter of timing			2
" ireport.com : ' not everything has to be complicated to be good '			0
