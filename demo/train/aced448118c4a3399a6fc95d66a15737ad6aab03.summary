-- @entity1 has traditionally held its ground as a premium computer manufacturer , but it might just be getting sucked into a recession - prompted price war			1
a worker helps a customer with a @entity8 laptop at an @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			2
the company 's recent @entity8 price cuts signify its reluctant conformity to the economic downturn			1
at its @entity16 on monday , @entity1 shaved hundreds of dollars off its @entity8 models			1
the high - end , 15 - inch @entity18 dropped from $ 2,000 to $ 1,700			0
and the price of the unibody @entity8 ( now renamed the 13 - inch @entity8 ) fell from $ 1,300 to $ 1,200			1
@entity1 's most inexpensive @entity8 , the lone white model , remains $ 1,000			1
" for a while they 've been ignoring what 's been happening in the economy , " said @entity21 , an @entity22 analyst			0
" this is an indication that they 're realizing that the first quarter did n't go as well as it has for them historically			0
i think this puts them closer in mind about what 's going on in the pc world			2
" still , @entity1 has avoided making even deeper price cuts , thanks to the juicy profit margins already baked into its products , the availability of cheap components , and the fact that the company also makes money by selling apps and music to @entity50 and @entity51 owners			1
all of these factors mean that @entity1 has room to comfortably trim prices even further , if it deems it necessary			0
for instance , the company dropped the price of its now low - end smartphone , the @entity58 , to just $ 100 with a two - year contract			2
but that cut does n't cost @entity1 as much as it might appear , given that the company still gets a carrier subsidy of several hundred dollars for each @entity50			2
@entity1 's computers have historically been priced well above the average pc			1
however , @entity1 's first quarter of 2009 market - share numbers suggest the company is struggling to compete as a premium brand name in the face of the economic recession			1
in the first quarter of 2009 , @entity1 's @entity73 notebook market share shrank 0.4 percent compared to the same quarter a year earlier , according to @entity21			1
and in worldwide notebook market share , the company saw 0.3 percent growth compared to the first quarter of 2008 , @entity21 said			0
additionally , @entity1 is likely hurting from its competitors ' aggressive pricing , cast into relief by @entity86 's recent @entity85 ad campaign , a @entity80 survey indicates			2
the pseudo reality - tv commercials denounce @entity1 computers as too expensive and even implies @entity90 users are simple - minded snobs who buy gadgets as a fashion statement			2
as a result , @entity86 is detracting from @entity1 's " value " score by convincing a substantial number of consumers that they get less for their money by buying a @entity90 , according to the survey			1
by cutting its prices somewhat , @entity1 may also be seizing the opportunity to strike a blow against the netbook market			0
in 2008 , low - powered , budget netbook pcs saw rapid growth , driven by value - conscious consumers looking for a good deal			0
@entity1 has no netbook in its lineup , and has said it has no plans to create a netbook			0
fortunately for @entity1 , netbook sales are seeing a significant slowdown in 2009			0
in april , netbook manufacturers @entity115 , @entity117 and @entity118 each reported fewer netbooks were sold than expected			0
their netbook shipments for the first quarter of 2009 fell considerably below shipments during the third quarter of 2008			0
@entity117 , for example , hoped to ship 1 million @entity126 pc systems during the first quarter , but only 900,000 units sold			0
thus , @entity1 's @entity8 price cuts are a strategic move to reclaim growth while the netbook market is shrinking			1
this move allows @entity1 to continue to avoid offering a netbook , which is wise , because an @entity1 netbook would have cannibalized macbook sales , according to @entity137 analyst @entity136			2
with the reduced @entity8 price tags , @entity136 expects @entity1 to see double - digit growth in notebook marketshare -- up to 20 percent -- in the third quarter of 2009			1
regardless , @entity1 's @entity8 price tags are still well above the cost of the average notebook -- $ 860 in the @entity73 , according to @entity21			1
@entity1 's cheapest macbook is anchored at $ 1,000 , and @entity1 could afford to bring it down even lower if it so chose			1
according to @entity147 , principal analyst with @entity148 , @entity1 's new pricing for its @entity8 line and the price drop on its lightweight @entity152 will not compromise much on its profit margins			1
" they are not favoring market share over profitability in a big way , " @entity147 explained			0
" they have already taken the pricing curve down on the unibody and chipsets , so they are building on those lower costs			0
" will @entity1 deliver a mobile computer for the average @entity165 in terms of cost ? perhaps so , in the form of a touchscreen tablet that many @entity1 enthusiasts are placing their bets on			2
@entity173 analyst @entity172 predicts such a device -- a blown - up @entity174 , of sorts -- will land as soon as 2010			0
