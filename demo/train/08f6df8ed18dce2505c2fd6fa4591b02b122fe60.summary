-- @entity2 's excellent birther adventure has been a moment of absurdity , irony and comeuppance , for him and for many in his party			1
@entity2 , the freshman @entity10 senator from @entity11 and a tea party darling , has made a name for himself as an incendiary obstructionist in the usually genteel @entity16			1
he may run for president in 2016			0
which means , under the @entity19 , that he has to be a " natural - born citizen			0
" he is indeed a natural - born citizen -- of @entity21			0
born in @entity22 to an @entity24 mother , @entity2 learned that he has unwittingly held @entity21 citizenship all his life			1
what was in doubt , thanks to a few birthers from the right and some mischievous eggers - on from the other side , was whether he could also claim @entity24 citizenship by birth			1
it turns out he can , given his mother 's status			0
initially , @entity2 issued affronted denials that he was anything but @entity24			1
then , upon discovering that he was " technically " also @entity21 , he scrambled to disavow and formally renounce any tie to his native land -- even though dual citizens can technically become president			0
@entity2 's comical predicament illuminates three things about the politics of @entity24 identity in this era of demographic flux			1
first , it is a reminder that people of color , whatever their party , are still more likely than whites to be presumed foreign			1
@entity56 , born in the @entity57 , and @entity58 , born to a father born in @entity60 , never faced conspiracy theories about whether they were ersatz @entity24 or @entity24 with divided loyalties			1
@entity64 , of course , did			0
and for a moment , at least , so did @entity2			1
they 're the lucky ones			0
millions of regular @entity24 who do n't care about their qualifications for the presidency are nonetheless subjected daily to suspicion based on their non-whiteness			2
second , those who live by race - tinged insinuations can die by them , too			0
@entity2 felt that he had to act swiftly to nip rumors of his outsiderness in the bud because he realized just how viciously they could spread out of control			2
he realized this because it was members of his own party who had incubated and propagated such insinuations about whether our son - of - a - @entity87 president was insufficiently committed to the @entity24 way			2
what goes around comes around , and when @entity92 ( who declined to rule on @entity2 's status because he had n't " studied it enough " ) is an arbiter of national authenticity , nobody is safe			1
perhaps the most delicious aspect of the @entity2 citizenship flap is that his form of alleged alienness was @entity21			2
what could be worse , for an anti-government rugged individualist , than a blood association with the land of free health care and the home of brave bureaucrats ? what could be worse , for a party struggling to diversify , than to have this @entity110 - @entity11 hopeful smothered in the blandness of a @entity21 eh ? perhaps @entity2 , chastened by his brush with un-american identity , will proceed with greater empathy for those on the margins of @entity24 life			1
perhaps leaders in his party will learn to forego the short - term electoral benefits of whipping up white fear of decline and white mistrust of people who may seem foreign			2
and perhaps activists from the other party will resist the temptation to brand any nonwhite conservative as a traitor or a fraud			0
what is certain is that the rest of this century will bring only more and more visible instances of political leaders who embody the ethnic complexity and impurity of citizenship in the @entity24			2
the party that figures out best how to embrace that complexity and convert it into an asset will be not just the majority party			0
it will be the most @entity24 party			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			0

@entity142 : @entity2 's excellent birther adventure has been a moment of absurdity , irony
**liu** : it is a reminder that people of color are still more likely to be presumed foreign
he says @entity56 and @entity58 never faced conspiracy theories on their origin
**liu** : maybe @entity2 now will have greater empathy for those on the margins of @entity24 life
