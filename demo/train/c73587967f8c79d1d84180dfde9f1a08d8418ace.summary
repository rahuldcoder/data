-- @entity2 legend @entity1 believes his country will rise above the problems which are blighting its preparations for football 's global showpiece and put on a " fantastic " @entity8			1
demonstrations -- some violent -- have been taking place all over @entity11 since last summer 's @entity12 , raising concerns about security at the upcoming tournament			2
they were originally organized to protest against increases in travel fares , but have since gone on to include demonstrations against staging the @entity8 , corruption in government and a lack of social spending			2
but @entity1 , who played in three winning @entity2 @entity8 sides , is confident that once the competition -- which starts on june 12 -- begins these issues will become of secondary importance			1
" we have had political problems , " he told @entity0			0
" but the @entity8 is a big party and it will be fantastic			0
" despite his status as a national hero , the 73 - year - old @entity1 came under fire for his reported criticism of protests which flared up at last year 's @entity12 and have continued on a sporadic basis ever since			1
it also apparently put him at odds with the current idol of the @entity2 fans , @entity40 's @entity39 , who said he was " inspired " by the mass mobilization , which has focused on poor quality public services while billions of dollars are being spent on the @entity8 and the 2016 @entity43 in @entity44			1
@entity1 was at pains to clarify his position			0
" i agree with him ( @entity39 ) -- we accept of course we want the best for our country in terms of schools and hospitals -- but the players have nothing to do with this or political corruption , " he said			1
" so it 's wrong to boo the players like happened in the @entity12 , i repeat again they have nothing to do with corruption and the other problems			0
" we need to separate these things because the players always show off the best side of @entity11 , let 's support them -- because this is a good moment for us			2
" politics aside , @entity1 is hoping @entity39 , who starred for his old club @entity66 before his big money move to @entity40 last summer , will benefit from playing in @entity69 club football to help @entity11 a record sixth @entity8 triumph			1
" a lot of @entity2 were annoyed when @entity66 sold him to @entity40 , " he said			0
" but for @entity39 it was fantastic as he gets more experience at the highest level and this will help the national team			0
" @entity1 played a starring role in @entity11 's triumphs in the finals of the 1958 and 1970 @entity81 and is hoping the current team can take their own place in footballing history			1
but he is wary about tipping them as winners - " football is a box of surprises , " he said -- pointing to @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 as their most dangerous challengers			0
" but @entity2 football is still the best and most beautiful in the world , " he added .			0

@entity1 confident @entity11 will host a *successful* @entity8 later this year
@entity101 protests and worries over *infrastructure* have blighted preparations
football legend says players are *blameless* for these problems and should be supported
believes @entity39 will be better for having played with @entity40
