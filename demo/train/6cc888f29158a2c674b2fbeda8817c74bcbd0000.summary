-- if competing in the @entity2 for the first time since 2002 came as a culture shock to @entity6 champions @entity5 they did n't show it			1

there had been fears before hand that some of @entity24 's players would be targeted by a section of @entity57 's fans who posted a manifesto on their website that said an absence of black players in the club 's squad was an " important tradition			2
" but after the game @entity24 manager @entity85 told a press conference : " i want to thank the people of @entity89 for their hospitality and how we 've been received here			2
" on their defeat he said : " i thought we looked solid and a threat going forward and could have been in the lead at half - time			2
" in 6 to 12 months ' time , we wo n't be making those mistakes			0
this is part of our growing pains as a group			0
we have to be more clinical			0
but we gave away two poor goals tonight			0
we ended up losing the game when we should have won it			0
