-- @entity2 driver @entity1 has confirmed that he will not be fit in time for the start of the 2012 @entity5 season			1
the 26 - year - old pole , winner of the @entity7 , missed the whole of this season after suffering serious injuries following a rallying crash in february			1
there had been some hope that @entity1 would be fit enough to start the new campaign , but he released a statement on the team 's official website confirming this would not be the case			1
@entity1 said : " i have come to the conclusion that i am not yet certain to be ready for the 2012 season			1
this was a difficult decision to make , but it is the most reasonable one			0
" i know that @entity2 need to prepare for next year , and further extending deadlines would not have been the right thing to do			2
on a personal level , my recovery is very encouraging and my doctors keep being impressed			0
" @entity1 added : " i just need more time , as i want to be 100 % ready before i commit to anything driving related			2
" team principal @entity31 also released a statement , saying : " everybody in the team is , of course , very disappointed			0
@entity1 not driving in @entity36 at the start of next season is not what we were all hoping for			1
" however , he has taken a very mature decision , acting in the best interests of @entity2			2
as a team and as a family , we remain 100 % behind him and we 'll help as much as we can			0
" @entity1 suffered a partial amputation of his forearm and compound fractures to his right elbow , shoulder and leg in the accident in @entity52 last february			0
he subsequently had three operations and has undergone a lengthy period of rehabilitation but has so far not driven a car			0
@entity1 's decision leaves the team with a choice of three drivers to fill its two seats , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , unless they look outside their current line - up .			1

@entity1 's @entity5 return with @entity2 has been *delayed*
@entity2 had been hoping the @entity70 driver would be fit for the start of the 2012 season
