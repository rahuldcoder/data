-- want welfare ? pee here			1
that 's the message that a growing number of governors and legislators , mainly @entity7 , are sending to their citizens			1
in statehouse after statehouse , new laws are being proposed and enacted that require recipients of food stamps , welfare , unemployment and other forms of public assistance to be able to pass a drug test first			1
the idea , say these policymakers , is to ensure that precious tax dollars wo n't flow to undeserving free - riders with moral failings			0
drug tests , they say , will motivate welfare recipients to clean up their acts and make themselves more employable all around			1
there are so many things wrong with this			0
for one thing , it 's the height of hypocrisy for limited - government conservatives like @entity38 gov. @entity37 , who claim they want government out of people 's lives , to champion such intrusive , shaming forms of paternalism			1
moreover , these programs typically yield rather few cases of actual " welfare junkies			1
" more outrageous , though , is the selective morality at work			1
when politicians say they want to make public assistance conditional on clean drug tests , they do n't mean all public assistance to all people			1
they mean assistance to the poorest among us			0
and with dog - whistle signals about " inner - city " welfare use , they often mean the brownest and blackest of the poorest among us			2
that 's why i find this drug - testing agenda repugnant			1
yet it does prompt a thought experiment			0
imagine , for a moment , if we took these moralistic politicians at their word			2
imagine if we instituted a policy nationwide that required anyone receiving taxpayer assistance to have to prove to the government that he or she is not using drugs			2
then imagine if we meant every form of taxpayer assistance			2
are you the chief executive of @entity81 or another @entity83 firm that received many billions of dollars in @entity85 bailout money ? fill this cup , please			1
and if you subscribe to the belief that corporations are people because a corporation is an association of persons , then every person who works at @entity81 had better get in line , too			2
after all , we want to make sure that precious tax dollars do n't flow to undeserving free - riders with moral failings			0
but do n't worry , testing financiers should motivate them to clean up their acts			0
but it 's not just @entity83			1
do you own a farm that receives federal payments to support the price of your crops ? did your business ever get a tax break to keep it from relocating ? does your factory pay unusually low electricity rates because of a nearby public power project ? you must be a drain on the public coffers			0
urination - on - demand is now your civic obligation			0
and of course , it 's not just about the 1 % or businesses			2
our federal latticework of direct subsidies and " tax expenditures " touches most of middle - class @entity122			0
so , imagine being told you must prove you are n't a drug user before you could claim a home mortgage interest deduction			2
before your employer - provided health insurance could be considered excludable from taxes			0
before you could receive a subsidized interest rate for your college loan			0
welfare -- in the form of subsidies , tax breaks and direct payments -- is everywhere			2
sometimes submerged , sometimes visible			0
the point is n't that welfare is presumptively bad ( or , for that matter , good )			2
the point is that because it is everywhere , welfare in all its various forms should be treated alike			1
so , if we want as a nation to attach a moral fitness test to the receipt of other people 's money , let 's do it across the board			1
indeed , let 's start with the premise that moral fitness requirements should be progressive â € ” that the more welfare you receive , the more stringent and unforgiving the form of testing you should face			1
why do n't these preening " welfare reformers " ever propose that ? ah yes , because that would require actual political courage			1
picking on poor citizens who get a few dollars of cash a day to feed themselves or pay the rent -- that 's politically cost - free			1
poor citizens do n't usually vote			0
poor citizens are n't usually visible enough to make others share in their suffering			0
poor citizens are , in short , the perfect punching bags for elected officials who want to look like they 're tough			0
but here 's the thing that is unavoidable			0
poor citizens are still citizens			0
to say the words " equal citizenship " with a straight face , we had all better ask ourselves where each of us would be without public assistance			0
and then perhaps be ready to join our poorest fellow citizens for a drug test .			1

new laws are being proposed that require recipients of welfare to pass a drug test
he says such programs , supported mostly by @entity7 , are shameful forms of paternalism
**liu** : let 's ask @entity83 ceos to take drug test since they received taxpayer bailout money
**liu** : it 's outrageous that politicians use selective morality to pick on poor people
