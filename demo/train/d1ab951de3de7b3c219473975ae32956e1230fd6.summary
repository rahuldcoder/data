@entity0 -- there 's " no touching " this			1
" @entity5 " fans can hardly wait for its sweet return on @entity8 at the end of this month , so what 's a few hours in line to get a photograph with the series - inspired @entity14 's @entity13 stand , making its way around @entity0 this week			1
fresh from touring @entity17 , the " popup " stopped by @entity19 on tuesday to promote season four 's may 26 release on @entity8			1
anyone patient enough to wait in a line stretching around @entity24 and @entity25 was treated to a chocolate - covered frozen banana for the occasion			2
actor @entity28 , who joined the cast this season , greeted the throngs			1
posing with the two actors serving the bananas , he delivered a famous line from the series : " there 's always money in the banana stand			2
" like " cutoffs " and the " chicken dance , " that line stayed with fans long after it was pulled from the air in 2006			2
despite its cult following , the show lasted only three seasons on @entity47			2
and its viewers , though few , were left clamoring for more			2
produced by @entity49 , " @entity5 " follows the bizarre moments shared by @entity14 ( portrayed by @entity51 ) and his eccentric family			1
the heart of the sitcom is its over-the - top characters played by @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , to name a few			2
new co-star crews says his personal favorite is @entity61 , played by @entity62			0
" the @entity61 character is so pathetic in so many ways , " he said			0
however , he also has a special place in his heart for @entity68 's character , @entity67			0
" you really feel like they 're members of your family , " @entity28 said			1
" and that 's what makes it so funny			0
because you recognize all the dysfunction , even in yourself			0
" crews calls the reunion of that dysfunction a " miracle " and credited the " grass - roots effort by the public and by its creator , @entity81			0
" " he put his whole life into bringing this show back for the fans , and @entity8 provided the wonderful opportunity , " @entity28 said			1
" it 's an iconic thing , and it 's an amazing thing to watch this happen			0
" crews -- a fan of the show who said he was thrilled to get the call from @entity81 to join the revived series -- considers the release of an entire season at once to be a game - changer for the industry			1
" in tv , they love standalone , 30 minutes , all - encompassing stories over ( series ) , " crews explained			0
" when you try to carry a story on , it 's just so hard			0
with network television , it 's almost impossible			0
" but thanks to @entity8 , he said , " you can tell the story as much as you want , and you can follow it as much as you want			0
" the actor points to the success of @entity8 's original series " @entity117 " as proof that releasing an entire season at one time can actually fuel fans ' hunger for more			1
and with only days remaining in " @entity122 " to " @entity5 , " questions are already being raised as to what comes next			1
" i think definitely the next step after this is a movie , " @entity28 said , adding to @entity81 's hints that he has tailored the new season to lead to film			1
" if ' @entity131 ' can get kickstarted into a movie , look at what the ' @entity5 ' crew is about and what this about			1
we could make this happen			0

fans in @entity0 got a sweet way to *celebrate* new season of " @entity5 "
