@entity1 's drug war in @entity3 is failing badly , a @entity1 government watchdog says in a new report			1
@entity3 farmers are growing bumper crops of opium poppies -- an unprecedented 209,000 hectares in 2013 -- even though @entity1 agencies spent $ 7.6 billion to stop narcotics production in the nation			1
@entity3 is the source of 80 % of the world 's illegal opium , the @entity1 government says , yielding $ 3 billion in sales in 2013 , up from $ 2 billion from the previous year			1
@entity1 authorities say a big chunk of that money funds @entity3 's insurgency and terrorism			1
as @entity22 winds down its war effort in the nation , the trend would appear to bode ill. since 2002 , the chief factors that appear to have caused temporary drops in poppy production were crop disease and high prices for wheat , an alternative crop for farmers , according to the report by the @entity34			0
" the recent record - high level of poppy cultivation calls into question the long - term effectiveness and sustainability of those prior efforts , " the report says			0
" given the severity of the opium problem and its potential to undermine @entity1 objectives in @entity3 , i strongly suggest that your departments consider the trends in opium cultivation and the effectiveness of past counternarcotics efforts when planning future initiatives			2
" the report says last year 's 209,000 - hectare record surpasses the previous high of 193,000 hectares of opium poppies grown in 2007			1
the report relies on figures from the @entity60 @entity61			0
the report says that areas that were once models for successful counterinsurgency and counternarcotics efforts are now booming poppy producers			0
the report cites @entity69 in eastern @entity3 , which the @entity60 declared " poppy - free " in 2008 but saw a fourfold increase in opium poppy production between 2012 and 2013			2
the inspector general sent the report to the @entity76 departments , which fund anti-drug efforts in @entity3			0
the @entity78 called the findings " disappointing " and blamed the increase in opium poppy production on shifts in the @entity3 government 's own security efforts			2
the @entity85 asked the inspector general to remove defense secretary @entity87 from receiving the report because the military plays a secondary role to other @entity1 government agencies in thwarting drug production in @entity3			1
" in our opinion , the failure to reduce poppy cultivation and increase eradication is due to the lack of @entity3 government support for the effort , " @entity93 , assistant secretary of defense , wrote to the inspector general			0
" poverty , corruption , the terrorism nexus to the narcotics trade , and access to alternative livelihood opportunities that provide an equal or greater profit than poppy cultivation are all contributors to the @entity3 drug problem			0
