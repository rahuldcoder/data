-- when the @entity2 took the stage toward the end of the annual @entity6 benefit show at @entity7 last night , there were none of the mirror balls or laser beams that typically end a lips show -- but the band had a different surprise in store			1
after a stunning take on rarely played " @entity18 " track " feeling you disintegrate , " frontman @entity15 invited composer @entity20 to the stage 's grand piano			1
" we 've been rehearsing with him all day , " @entity15 said			1
" and he 's pretty f -- ing cool			1
" the band kicked into a slow , hushed version of their classic " do you realize ? " , @entity15 strumming his acoustic guitar , the body of which was connected to a green bubble			1
late in the song , @entity20 took over with a spiraling piano line that vaguely hinted at the @entity2 ' melody while guitarist @entity36 slowly added chilling touches of reverb			1
@entity15 looked visibly moved and stopped playing entirely , closed his eyes and raised his fist , grinning			1
@entity0 : exclusive performance : @entity2 rehearse trippy version of ' do you realize ? ' " playing with him is how playing with @entity46 must have been , " @entity15 said after the performance , " changing something just as you 're catching on			2
and that 's exactly what you want			2
" this year marked the 61st anniversary of the 1950 @entity51 , and the benefit -- which also featured @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and the roots -- is in its 21st year			1
the show kicked off with several @entity59 monks in robes chanting in front of a large painting of the region 's sprawling @entity63			2
the roots were the first performers to bring the entire audience to their feet when they were joined by @entity68 for a rousing " @entity69			1
" their peak was their take on @entity73 's " @entity76 , " a reprise from their @entity7 appearance last month at a @entity73 tribute show			2
guitarist captain @entity77 took center stage , wailing on his @entity79 and throwing in riffs of " @entity81 " under @entity73 's lyrics			2
@entity83 are n't touring off " @entity84 " ( out march 8th ) , but @entity54 looked thrilled to be onstage			2
he debuted two never - performed @entity83 songs : " @entity86 , " off 2008 's " reveal , " which he performed standing behind the piano , and gorgeous new " collapse " track " everyday is yours to win			0
" he told the crowd he had only played the song in bassist @entity96 ' living room in @entity97 two weeks earlier , but it sounded like an @entity83 classic			0
@entity0 : @entity54 discusses making " @entity84 " at rehearsal for @entity100 last year , @entity101 made a scene stage diving into the relatively stiff @entity7 crowd as @entity53 watched from the side of the stage			1
this year , she gave the most aggressive performance , beginning with the @entity108 ' " @entity107 , " which sounded like more of a plea than ever , and then kicked into an apocalyptic take on @entity113 's " @entity112			1
" her band grooved on the raucous @entity115 beat while @entity53 gave an impassioned speech that proved she 's been glued to the news lately			0
" in @entity118 and @entity119 ...			0
the people are taking to the streets , taking the power ! " she yelled			0
she also cited recent mysterious incidents -- thousands of blackbirds falling from the sky and dead fish washing up in @entity128 -- saying , " @entity129 is calling with such anguish			0
we must find a way to show love , because if you do n't show love for @entity129 , she will fucking take you down ! " @entity0 : video : watch @entity101 's final stage dive at @entity7 at the after party at @entity140 's @entity139 , @entity15 clutched he scarves he wore during his performance			0
he was still beaming from playing with @entity20			0
" there 's a vulnerability to the song , and i think he knew that , " @entity15 said			0
" that vulnerability makes all the difference			0
that makes it believable and makes it seem like anything can happen			0
