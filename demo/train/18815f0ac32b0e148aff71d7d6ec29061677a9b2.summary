@entity0 -- it 's not unusual for a visiting head of state to lay a wreath at the @entity5 in @entity0 's @entity6 -- but when it happens on tuesday , the gesture will be anything but routine			1
this is history in the making			0
the commemoration by the president of @entity13 , @entity12 , will take place during the first state visit by an @entity17 leader to the @entity18			1
it follows on from @entity21 's trip to @entity22 in may 2011 , the first by a @entity18 monarch to the republic since it gained independence from @entity0 in 1921			1
the countries are close neighbors but have a long , contentious , often violent history which has left thousands dead , among them @entity30 , a relative of the @entity21 who was killed by an @entity33 ( @entity32 ) bomb in 1979			2
the very fact that the @entity18 and the @entity17 once fought with each other under the same flag is still very difficult for many @entity17 republicans to stomach			2
but the relationship between the two countries has gradually normalized since the peace process of the 1990s			1
that will be formally acknowledged when @entity12 pays his respects at the tomb of an unknown @entity18 soldier who died during @entity46 when @entity17 was under @entity18 rule			0
diplomats from both countries are stressing the significance of the five - day trip			0
@entity52 , the @entity17 ambassador to @entity0 , has said that @entity22 is " now willing to look at the facts of history " rather than shying away from them			1
meanwhile a @entity57 spokesperson has said that the visit is about acknowledging the past but also " demonstrating that the relationship is moving on and looking to the future			0
" the spokesperson stressed that both state visits are " pivotal moments in our shared history			0
" the @entity21 's trip nearly three years ago included a visit to @entity67 , a @entity22 sports stadium where 14 people were killed by @entity18 forces in 1920 during the war of independence			1
she also spoke in @entity72 during a dinner in @entity22 to audible gasps in the room ; and visited @entity13 in june 2012 , when she shook hands with former @entity32 commander @entity77 , now the province 's deputy first minister			0
these were all highly symbolic moments that politicians could n't create to the same effect -- and @entity84 is well aware of that			0
a palace spokesperson said last month that the @entity21 herself has become a symbol of the warming relationship between the two countries			2
the significance of this week 's state visit will be further underlined by the presence of @entity77 at a reception hosted by the @entity21 on thursday afternoon at @entity94 - a move unthinkable only a decade ago			1
the palace spokesperson confirmed that the @entity21 is heavily invested in the state visit and that it is personal for her , adding that " the @entity21 is across every detail			2
" expect the @entity17 president to have everything laid on for him , with all the pomp and ceremony that the royal household can muster			1
tensions still remain in @entity13 : while the bloodshed of previous decades has largely stopped there are still occasional incidents which pose a threat to life and tensions remain between the communities			0
but @entity114 relations are improving with each symbolic moment -- and this week 's state visit is as symbolic as it gets			2
read : @entity116 : finally , @entity18 and @entity13 are reconciled			0
