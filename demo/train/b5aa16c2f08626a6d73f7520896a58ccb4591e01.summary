-- could another deep water - or even shallow water - oil drilling disaster be looming ahead ? experts warn it certainly could happen again			0
the @entity6 catastrophe , they say , highlights flaws in the drilling industry 's main defense against oil and gas explosions -- the blowout preventer , which is supposed to shut down an oil and gas well if something goes wrong			1
oil companies have treated such devices as virtually fail - safe			0
" they 're certainly not fail - safe because they did n't close this well , " said @entity18 , a petroleum engineering professor at the @entity19			0
" if they had been 100 percent fail - safe they would have sealed , they would have closed. , " there have been numerous rig blowouts , including a large gusher in the @entity30 off the coast of @entity32 last year			1
and a growing number of blowouts in the past decade have caused offshore oil drilling to become sloppier			2
seventy - two spills dumped 18,000 barrels of oil into @entity40 federal waters from 2000 - 2009 , while only 15 spills put 2,000 barrels into the water during the prior decade , according to data compiled by the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) of the @entity46 , which regulates energy exploration ( the database excludes spills of less than 50 barrels )			0
avoiding such spills depends upon the reliability of the blowout preventer , which is essentially a faucet on top of the oil well that keeps oil and gas from gushing to the surface			2
rig workers use the preventer to keep a well under control , especially when oil and gas surge , or " kick up , " from a well			2
when its valves do n't do the job , the blowout preventer can choke off the drilling pipe -- like squeezing a straw while drinking			2
and , if that fails to work , a blowout preventer has yet another line of defense -- huge shear rams , like giant scissors that are supposed to be able to cut and seal the drilling pipe			1
but , a mile underwater , where the pressure is intense , drill pipes need to be thick , especially the joints between them			0
and those joints are very hard to cut			0
" there are some parts of the pipe that the shears were never meant to cut , " said @entity80 , an expert in petroleum project management who is advising the @entity46 's oil drilling safety review			1
" no one 's equipment will shear the drill collar body			2
that 's a lot of metal			0
it 's not going to be possible to shear certain things , " added @entity92 , another advisor to @entity46 's review of the @entity6 incident and president of @entity96 , which designs and manufactures oilfield and subsea drilling equipment			1
a 2002 study for the @entity45 warned of such trouble in shearing drilling pipe deep underwater			2
initial research painted " a grim picture of the probability of success when utilizing this final tool in securing a well , " wrote consultant @entity112			2
@entity112 would not comment to @entity0 on its studies for the government			0
" the blowout preventers had a probability of failing to crush that pipe that approaches 50 percent , " said @entity115 , engineering professor and expert in ocean engineering at the @entity118 , who is familiar with the study			1
" it would be like getting on an airplane having a 50 percent chance of making it to your destination			0
" based on 55 years of engineering experience , including a stint as chief offshore engineer for @entity133 , @entity129 warned government investigators that blowout preventers are not reliable in the deep sea , and he worries they could fail in the @entity138 , where the industry is pursuing energy resources			1
" you can keep on pushing equipment to the point of where it breaks , and i think we broke it , " he said			2
" all of the drilling operations underway of this nature in the world today depend on these devices as the final line of defense			2
" in the harshest of environments , a mile underwater or in the @entity138 tundra , blowout preventers operate under great stress , increasing their potential vulnerability to wear and tear			1
" it is a mechanical piece of equipment			2
it is utilized in harsh environments			0
yes , it can wear out , " said @entity165 , chairman of the @entity166 at @entity167			0
in fact , @entity169 told congressional investigators there were several leaks in the hydraulic system that was supposed to power the shear rams of the @entity6 's blowout preventer			1
" it was a coupling that had not been tightened down adequately			0
it was several turns loose , " said a person with knowledge of the investigation			0
@entity169 officials also discovered a dead battery			0
the final safety switch for a blowout preventer that has lost communication with its oil rig is the " deadman " system that 's supposed to trigger the blowout preventer to shut the well			1
it did not activate during @entity169 's april 20 rig explosion			0
another study @entity112 prepared for the @entity195 in 2003 found flaws with the deadman system			1
" the most serious drawback to this system ... is the mind set of the rig personnel			1
many operator and contractor personnel refuse to arm the system from fear that it will either not operate when needed or activate inappropriately , causing downtime , " the report said			1
such downtime can be extremely costly			0
if the blowout preventer cuts through drilling pipe it can easily cost $ 10 million to replace that section of pipe and put the rig back into production , said @entity92			1
given the multiple problems with blowout preventers , energy experts concede the oil industry must quickly raise its safety bar			1
" we must improve the safety systems of blowout preventers			1
obviously it 's time to take it to the next level , " said @entity92			0
" there are more strenuous conditions occurring and we must have more strenuous solutions for them			0
" the @entity46 , facing the reality of energy drilling dangers , is working to toughen rules for offshore oil exploration			0
" we must ensure that offshore drilling is conducted safely and in compliance with the law , " said interior secretary @entity236			0
drilling operations not subject to the administration 's six - month deepwater drilling moratorium have until the end of the month to : -- provide independent third party verification of the safety and effectiveness of blowout preventers , -- install a secondary control system for subsea blowout preventers ( current regulations do not require such a backup ) , and -- adhere to new inspection and reporting requirements for blowout preventers			1
by september the @entity46 intends to require blowout preventers to have two sets of shear rams spaced at least four feet apart in case a drill pipe joint is in front of a shear during an emergency			1
the @entity46 says such steps will " increase the safety in offshore oil and gas development , " but concedes they " represent only the beginning of the department 's work			1

rig blowouts have been on the increase in recent decades
blowout preventers have multiple safety functions : all failed on @entity6
expert : equipment not designed to work in extreme conditions
study found many personnel would not arm final failsafe to avoid possible downtime
