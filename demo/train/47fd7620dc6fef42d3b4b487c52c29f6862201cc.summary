-- okay , that may actually just be a line from @entity3 in " @entity4 , " but in the case of " @entity7 , " @entity9 's annual summer competition that manages to be the spiritual heir to " the @entity11 , " a poignant homage to vaudeville , and a grotesque felliniesque carnival — sometimes all at the same time — it 's especially true			2
season 7 , which wrapped tonight , saw both the departure of longtime judge @entity17 and the crowning of a new talent shortly to be unleashed upon the unsuspecting tourists of @entity21			1
this year , the finalists included two performance painters -- one whose medium was sand , thus becoming the first sand painter to reach an audience beyond your local renaissance fair -- an " earth harpist , " a dog trick act , a kiddie dance troupe , and a comedian who found @entity35 's hair to be the greatest source of fodder for his act			1
but there could be only one winner			0
and that was ... [ spoiler alert for those who have n't watched tonight 's finale yet ] ' @entity45 ' : evicted houseguest is ... the @entity47 ! yes , @entity48 deemed the act of two dog trainers and their cuddly , trick - performing canines -- their act consists of the pooches bounding through hoops , jumping rope on their hind legs , and riding in toy suvs -- as the worthiest finalists			1
i suppose the result should n't be a shock since we live in the age of cute - pet @entity65 videos , but it 's hard to imagine anyone paying top dollar to see them perform in @entity21 , the career - launching prize of all " @entity7 " winners			0
runner - up @entity72 , a comedian who relies on one - liner jokes about the ethics of the prince kissing an unconscious @entity77 , seemed like a better choice for the @entity21			0
he delivered a tag - team bit with @entity81 mocking @entity35 ( the shockjock has " gay pirate hair " ! ) that cried out for extensive rim - shot accompaniment			0
@entity86 exits ' @entity87 ' @entity88 , which i assume to be former " @entity7 " winners themselves , added their @entity92 whimsy to the proceedings , as did @entity94 and reality - competition show staples @entity95 and @entity97 , showing that " @entity7 " is making an aggressive play to usurp " @entity99 " as the series with the most filler on tv			1
if you watched , are you happy with the outcome ? would you pay top dollar to watch top dogs jump rope for 90 minutes ? or do you hope that this act , like virtually every " @entity7 " winner before it , stays in @entity21 ... and is never heard from again ? also , is there any point in watching the @entity88 if one @entity113 is n't involved ? see the full article at @entity0			2
