-- @entity1 confirmed tuesday that its forces killed @entity3 , reputed boss of the ruthless @entity5 cartel , but it remains uncertain what effect , if any , the killing will have on the larger scourge of drug trafficking and violence			1
the kingpin 's death is arguably the @entity1 government 's biggest takedown since president @entity15 launched an offensive six years ago , but the record is mixed on the impact of such successes			1
@entity1 marines killed @entity3 in a shootout on sunday in a small town in northern @entity1 , 130 miles from the @entity22 border , the country 's navy said			1
@entity3 was a onetime special forces soldier who became a founding member of the @entity5 , a group accused of some of the most violent atrocities that have come to define the drug wars			1
another @entity5 leader arrested in @entity32 killing in a twist , a group of armed men stole @entity3 's body from a funeral home , though authorities had already taken fingerprints and photographs to confirm his identity			1
@entity3 's death " certainly weakens dramatically the @entity5 , " said @entity42 , professor of government at the @entity44 and author of a book on the cartel			1
the death is the latest in a string of blows against its leadership , he said			2
other analysts said it was unclear how @entity3 's death would affect the @entity5			1
" even though the head falls , there is immediately a substitute , " said @entity55 , a @entity1 journalist who has investigated the country 's cartels			0
the intelligence firm @entity61 said it expects @entity3 's death to have little impact on the @entity5 ' operations			1
@entity3 's health had been failing and he had already transferred much control of the organization to @entity67 , @entity61 said			1
the @entity68 and @entity1 combined had offered rewards of more than $ 7 million for information leading to his capture			0
praising the navy 's efforts tuesday , @entity15 described @entity3 as " one of the most important and most dangerous " people on @entity1 's list of most wanted criminals			1
the organization he led , @entity15 said , is behind " countless high - impact crimes and extreme violence that many communities in the country have suffered			1
" the @entity5 are responsible for smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs annually to the @entity68 , generating many millions of dollars			0
the name of the cartel conjures up some of the most violent images of the drug war : a casino fire that killed 52 people , the deaths of 72 migrants , and tortured bodies hanging from bridges			2
7 bodies found in western @entity1 the marines who killed @entity3 had responded sunday to reports of an armed group in the town of @entity103 , in the northern state of @entity105 , the navy said			1
they were attacked with grenades thrown from a moving vehicle and a firefight ensued , it said			0
a local newspaper reported scenes of " panic and terror " as the shootout erupted next to where families were enjoying a baseball game			0
rather than after an ambush , the shooting started after the marines tried to search a suspicious @entity124 , the @entity120 newspaper said			0
authorities at the scene recovered two assault rifles , a grenade launcher and 12 grenades , as well as a rocket launcher and two rockets			0
the @entity5 -- headquartered in @entity132 , @entity1 , directly across the border from @entity132 , @entity22 -- make up @entity1 's largest drug cartel in terms of territory			2
the group has operations in 11 @entity1 states			2
another reputed @entity5 leader , @entity140 , alias " @entity141 , " was captured last month			0
@entity3 , 37 , joined the @entity1 armed forces in 1991 and was part of its elite airborne special forces group , dedicated to battling drug cartels			1
soon after , @entity3 and several other special forces members were recruited by the @entity149 cartel to create its enforcement arm , @entity5			1
@entity152 boss arrested in ensuing years , the @entity5 split into a major drug trafficking organization and have since branched out into extortion , kidnapping and human smuggling			2
the cartel is in the midst of a bloody turf war with its former employer , the @entity149 cartel , and also with the @entity157			0
the fight for access to lucrative smuggling routes in northern and central @entity1 has left thousands of civilians dead			0
the violence is particularly acute in three northeastern states that are some of the @entity5 ' strongest - held territory : @entity105 , @entity168 and @entity169			2
in 2010 , the bodies of 72 migrants from @entity172 and @entity173 were discovered at a ranch in @entity169 state			0
the @entity5 have been blamed for the mass graves and for the deaths of the migrants			0
the cartel also is blamed for setting a fire at a casino in @entity182 that killed 52 people			0
in may , authorities found 49 decapitated and dismembered bodies along a highway in @entity168			0
the orders to commit the grisly crime allegedly came from @entity3 , who originally wanted the bodies to be left in a town 's central square			1
in banners purportedly hung by the cartel , the group denied involvement			2
@entity1 officials have said that more than 47,500 people have been killed in drug - related violence since @entity15 began his crackdown on cartels in december 2006			2
some groups say the number is much higher			0
45 days of intel work led to drug lord 's capture in @entity206 @entity0 's @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 in @entity210 , and journalist @entity211 in @entity105 state , @entity1 , contributed to this report .			0
