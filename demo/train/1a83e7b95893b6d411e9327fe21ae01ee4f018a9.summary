" there will be a tendency on the part of some to condemn what we just saw , but we should not , " @entity14 said			1
" what we saw there was a genuine expression of concern and involvement			2
and it is through that level of involvement , that level of concern and i hope a level of perseverance and commitment , that change ultimately will come			0
and so let me be clear , let me be clear , i ai n't mad atcha , all right ? " demonstrators were escorted out of the church after about 30 seconds and continued to protest outside			0

audience members applauded and cheered as he told the crowd monday night that those investigations were ongoing			0
" these twin investigations have been rigorous and they have been independent from the beginning			0
now , while federal civil rights law imposes an extremely high legal bar in these types of cases , we have resisted prejudging the evidence or forming premature conclusions , " @entity14 said			1
" and as these investigations proceed , i want to assure the @entity100 people that they will continue to be conducted thoroughly and in a timely manner , following the facts and the law wherever they may lead			0

@entity166 players speak out : several @entity166 players sent a silent but strong message before they took the field sunday against the @entity170			1
the players raised their palms in the air , repeating the " hands up , do n't shoot " gesture that protesters in @entity3 have been using for months			1
but the move infuriated the @entity166 @entity176 , which issued a statement saying it was " profoundly disappointed " with the group of @entity166 " who chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the @entity182 this week			1
" " the gesture has become synonymous with assertions that @entity6 was innocent of any wrongdoing and attempting to surrender peacefully when @entity80 , according to some now - discredited witnesses , gunned him down in cold blood , " the police association wrote			1
@entity189 , the @entity166 ' coach , told reporters monday that the players would not be disciplined			1

but the @entity166 characterized the conversation differently			1
" we did not apologize , " @entity166 spokesman @entity209 told @entity0			1
the team issued a statement saying the organization had " positive discussions " monday with @entity213 and other police officials " during which we expressed our respect for their concerns surrounding yesterday 's game			2

and now @entity80 is no longer a @entity3 police officer			2
but what 's next ? " that 's a million dollar question , " said @entity231 , one of @entity80 's attorneys			0
" he 's probably going to go back to school			0
he 's probably going to have to pursue other areas of employment , because i think it 's quite obvious a job in law enforcement is highly unlikely at this point in time , " @entity235 told @entity0 's @entity236 on monday			0
@entity80 is considering possibly studying business , finance or accounting , attorney @entity243 said			2
he made the decision to resign , his attorneys said , to put a stop to threats targeting other police officers in @entity3			2

" for obvious reasons , i wanted to wait until the grand jury made their decision before i officially made my decision to resign			0
