-- @entity2 's monthlong assault on the @entity3 has taken a heavy toll , with some 2,000 @entity3 killed and 10,000 more wounded			1
most of these victims were civilians and many of them children , representing just the latest bloody chapter in a tragic history			0
during the long decades of the @entity2 - @entity3 conflict , the international community has not fully met or addressed legitimate @entity3 aspirations			1
nowhere is that better illustrated than in @entity14			1
chronically short of food , water and electricity , and cut off from the outside world by closed borders and blockades , the @entity3 in @entity14 are desperate			1
as an individual who has fought tirelessly for human rights , i can not ignore their plight , and as a fellow @entity25 , i can not ignore this wanton denial of @entity3 rights			2
the people of @entity14 need three things			2
first , they need a peace agreement that ends the hostilities and lifts an @entity2 siege that has been in place since 2007 and has turned @entity14 into what some journalists have called " an open - air jail			1
" second , the @entity3 in @entity14 need humanitarian aid and funding for development , so they can rebuild their shattered lives , their bombed - out neighborhoods and their fractured communities			1
and finally , @entity3 everywhere need a comprehensive agreement that will end the occupation and establish two states for two peoples , allowing @entity2 and @entity3 to live @entity48 in peace and security			1
until a two state solution becomes a reality , the fighting and bloodshed will almost certainly continue			0
as @entity56 has said many times , peace must be achieved through negotiations , with all sides in the conflict represented			1
@entity56 has already provided humanitarian assistance to the people of @entity14 and we have pledged to assist with rebuilding efforts once hostilities have ended			1
but we are also working behind the scenes to facilitate the kind of dialogue that can lead to a lasting peace			0
ultimately , @entity56 wants to help the @entity3 realize their self - determination by establishing a secure @entity3 state			1
@entity56 makes no claim to being a major player on the global stage			2
but beginning in the mid- 1990s , our government embraced an open door foreign policy focused on relationship - building and conflict mediation that has benefited both @entity56 and the global community			2
this open door policy has allowed @entity56 to serve as a mediator for conversation , cooperation , and the advancement of peace			1
with our doors wide open , our capital , @entity87 , has increasingly become the center of a vibrant , new multicultural nation , with the creation of a knowledge - based economy enshrined as one of the key goals of our 2030 national vision			0
it is precisely because we are impartial that we are often approached to mediate and create platforms for dialogue between different factions			0
in 2008 , for example , we were able to broker a peace agreement between the various factions battling for supremacy in southern @entity105			2
later , we played a similar role in @entity107			0
over the years we have hosted an @entity2 @entity108 and kept our door open to @entity111 think tanks like the @entity112			0
more recently , because of our open door policy , we were able to help negotiate the exchange of an @entity116 soldier for five @entity118 prisoners			0
and today we are helping facilitate communication between the @entity116 , the @entity120 , our @entity25 neighbors , @entity2 and @entity122 as the various parties struggle to find a peaceful solution to the violence in @entity14			2
in each instance , we feel we have been on the right side of history			0
but more important , we believe that we have been on the right side of justice , human rights and human dignity			0
all these qualities and attributes are on trial in @entity14 today , and once again , history will judge our actions			2
@entity56 stands ready to help reconcile differences and advance the prospects for peace			1
we stand ready to play our part in advancing dialogue and achieving solutions to the seemingly intractable problems confronting the people of the @entity145			0
some of these problems , like @entity14 , have been years or even decades in the making			0
but that does not mean they can not be solved			0
the bleeding , the suffering and the dying must be stopped			0
in @entity56 , we will always keep an open door to peace .			1

@entity155 : *isolated* , short of food and water , @entity3 in @entity14 are desperate
he says @entity160 need peace pact , humanitarian aid and development funding
@entity155 : they need an agreement for two states for two peoples , and @entity56 can help
he says @entity56 has helped in tough negotiations before and stands ready to help here
