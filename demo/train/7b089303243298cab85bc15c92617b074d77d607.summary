-- road - tripping to a national park makes for an easy -- and spectacular -- summer getaway			2
while all the @entity4 national parks will be open this summer , forced federal spending cuts mean reduced programs and facility access			1
the @entity8 has cut 5 % from its 2013 budget			1
the parks will be open and ready for summer visitors , according to @entity8 spokesman @entity12 , but these changes are likely : fewer staff and programs the @entity8 will hire approximately 1,000 fewer seasonal employees to provide programs and staffing during the peak summer season			1
with fewer park employees , visitors may notice delayed road and park openings , reduced hours of operation , fewer program offerings and longer wait times at entrance stations			1
shorter seasons several parks , especially those that close in the winter , have delayed their reopening due to a lack of crews to clear the roads			1
@entity36 in @entity37 , for example , opened two weeks late this spring to reduce snow plowing costs , and some secondary roads will reopen only as snow melts			0
at @entity44 in @entity45 , the winter closure of park facilities was extended by an extra month			0
similar delays have happened in @entity47 in @entity48 and @entity49 in @entity50			0
selected facilities will not open portions of a number of parks will not open as a cost saving measure			1
in @entity58 , for example , @entity56 will close the @entity59 due to reduced staffing			0
at @entity63 in @entity64 , six interpretive sites in the park will remain closed , including the @entity65 , where @entity66 drafted the @entity67			0
and on the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , 14 restrooms along the 444 - mile parkway will be closed two days per week , and four will be closed for the entire 2013 season			0
closed selected days a number of national parks will close for one or more days a week			1
this includes the @entity79 in @entity80 and @entity82 's @entity81 , which will close on sundays and mondays , as well as on all federal holidays			0
other examples include the @entity85 in @entity86 , which will close on mondays , and the visitor centers at @entity88 in @entity89 , which will be closed two days a week			2
fewer campgrounds along the @entity91 in @entity86 and @entity92 , the @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity96 campgrounds will remain closed through the summer ; an additional four picnic areas and three visitor centers will not open this year			2
@entity99 in @entity73 is closing three remote campgrounds and two picnic areas this summer			0
at @entity36 , several campsites and restroom facilities will not open this year			0
fewer ranger programs many national parks are reducing the number and schedule of park ranger programs this summer			1
at @entity112 in @entity113 , all programs at the park 's @entity110 are cancelled ; the @entity114 at @entity116 's @entity115 is eliminating 60 % of its programs due to staff reductions ; and @entity119 in @entity86 is cutting its offerings by more than half			0
curtailed maintenance operations visitors may also be affected by a reduction of routine maintenance			1
@entity127 's @entity126 will delay hiring a park electrician and seven seasonal guides , resulting in the closure of the most remote sections of the cave			2
trails damaged by high water in @entity135 in @entity136 will remain closed due to lack of staff to repair boundary fences and other areas			0
and at @entity140 in @entity141 , reduced seasonal hiring at the end of the summer will result in less maintenance , mowing , rock removal , patching , striping and shoulder dressing along the @entity148 and other main park roads			1

adjusted hours , programs and the latest information on changes will be updated for each park throughout the summer .			2
