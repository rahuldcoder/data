-- one night in late july this year , the @entity2 supertanker @entity3 was making its way through the @entity5 -- the chokepoint at the southern tip of the @entity8			1
it was en route to @entity2 with 3 million barrels of crude oil			1
there was a loud thud at the front of the ship			2
its hull suffered a substantial square - shaped dent above the waterline			0
theories about the cause quickly abounded : a giant wave , a collision with a submarine or another vessel			0
and then -- six days later -- a militant @entity28 group that had been active in @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 claimed it had attacked the ship with an explosives - laden boat			1
the @entity35 said the attack on the @entity3 " sought to weaken the infidel global order which is thrust into @entity38 lands and which loots its resources			1
" for the brigades , such an attack was a significant departure from previous targets			2
to begin with , intelligence analysts were skeptical of the claim			0
but @entity48 officials now say it is credible			0
" government and industry sources can confirm that the claim by the @entity35 brigades ... is valid , " the @entity48 @entity51 's @entity50 said in an advisory last week			1
" the group remains active and can conduct further attacks on vessels in areas in the @entity5 , southern @entity8 , and western @entity62 , ' it said			1
the @entity63 are already anxious about the foothold that @entity65 has established in neighboring @entity66			0
now the brigades -- spawned in the squalor of @entity70 refugee camps in @entity29 -- may be an emerging player in the region 's terror landscape			1
the brigades are named after a @entity70 close to @entity65 leader @entity76			1
@entity35 was killed in @entity77 in 1989 by a bomb explosion			1
the group is led by one @entity80 , who fought @entity48 forces in @entity82 and got to know @entity65 's now - dead leader there -- @entity84			2
born in the @entity63 city of @entity86 , @entity80 is only 28 , but is already on the kingdom 's most wanted list			0
when that list was first published in february 2008 , he was described as " one of the key suppliers of facilities , finances , fake documents " for @entity65			0
and he has ambitious aims , telling an extremist website earlier this year : " all the jihadist battlefields now are fields of fighting			0
" the brigades have certainly shown themselves capable of audacious attacks			0
they claimed responsibility for an unsuccessful rocket attack on a @entity48 warship anchored in the @entity31 port of @entity106 in 2005 , as well as for bombings in 2004 and 2005 aimed at tourists in @entity30 's @entity110 resorts			1
well over 100 people were killed in those attacks			0
in the interview he gave to the @entity114 , @entity80 described how @entity84 had sent him on a mission beyond @entity82			0
he 'd been arrested in @entity116 and spent a brief spell in a @entity63 jail			0
describing his priorities , @entity80 said they include kidnapping @entity48 and @entity123 citizens in the @entity8 peninsula			1
" @entity48 interests are our most important aims , " he said , according to a translation by intelligence website @entity126			0
it is also clear from the interview that @entity80 is very much a @entity28 purist			1
he has little time for the @entity135 , accusing it of attacking @entity29 's @entity28			2
he also accuses @entity29 shiites of " malice " toward the country 's @entity28			2
that suggests the @entity35 would not have looked to @entity140 for help or harbor in attacking the @entity3 ( even if @entity63 officials insist @entity80 once operated from @entity140			2
) and it prompts this question : where did that small boat , laden with explosives , come from on the night of july 27 to attack the @entity3 ? if not @entity140 , did it set out under cover of darkness from the @entity151 , @entity152 or even @entity63 -- undetected by authorities ?			2

the @entity35 may be an emerging player in the @entity8 landscape
the militant @entity28 group is named for a @entity70 close to @entity76
the group claimed responsibility for an attack on a @entity2 supertanker in july
