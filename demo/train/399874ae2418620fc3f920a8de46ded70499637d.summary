-- the final , violent moments in the life of their son , @entity3 , no longer dominate the national news , as they once did			1
tens of thousands no longer attend rallies demanding justice for the slain teenager ; pundits no longer debate the case on every media platform imaginable			0
what once had been the big story has increasingly become yesterday 's news			0
but @entity15 and @entity16 have n't stopped fighting			0
one year ago tuesday , they were grieving and relatively anonymous parents , trying to come to grips with the sudden death of their 17 - year - old son			2
but in time , they became celebrities of sorts in a world of gun violence and vigilante justice			0
to their supporters , they were the faces and the voices of victims of racial profiling			0
talk back : one year later , what have we learned ? while the spotlight largely has faded since then , they say their commitment has not			0
" we ( want to ) make sure that no other parents have to go through what we have gone through in the last year , " @entity39 told @entity0 's @entity40 on monday night			0
on february 26 , 2012 , her teenage son was walking back to the @entity45 , @entity46 , home of his father 's fiancee after picking up some @entity49 and an iced tea at @entity51			1
that 's when , and where , then - 28 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer @entity53 spotted him			1
what happened the night @entity3 died what happened between then and when @entity53 fatally shot the teen is subject to dispute , one that could be settled by a jury starting june 10 , when @entity53 is set to go on trial on a second - degree murder charge			1
as the prosecution and defense lawyers battled in court in the weeks and months that followed , @entity3 's parents became less visible on the national scene			1
but they 've still been active , said @entity39 , including continuing to work on behalf of the justice for @entity69 , which they started			0
they held a benefit dinner for the nonprofit organization , as well as a peace walk in @entity76 " to let teenagers know they have a right to walk in peace , " she said monday			0
on tuesday , the anniversary of their son 's death , they 'll be in @entity85 for a candlelight vigil			0
five things to know their efforts include continuing to speak out on issues			0
among them is gun violence , a debate over which is brewing in @entity95 and nationwide after several grisly mass shootings , including one that left 20 children and 6 adults dead at a @entity102 elementary school last december			0
" it 's just too much senseless violence ; it 's overwhelming the homes right now , " @entity16 said monday , referring to the @entity104 massacre as well as murders in places like @entity107			0
" we , as parents , certainly feel the pain			0
" even as they continue to fight , @entity3 's parents acknowledge that -- after months in the spotlight , trying to ramp up pressure on authorities to go after @entity53 -- much about their son 's case is now out of their hands			1
their lawyer , @entity123 , on monday asked rhetorically if @entity53 is " not held accountable , what message does that send to the next child that 's killed , unarmed , on the ground ? " still , @entity15 said that , to a large extent , she and her ex-husband have gotten what they asked for			1
@entity53 was arrested and , unless something unforeseen happens , he will stand trial			2
opinion : what we can learn from @entity3 shooting " we just want to have that trial , and let the jury decide , " she said			1
" and whatever decision comes out of that , we 're going to accept that			2
" we may not like it , but we 're going to accept it			2
" the jury will have to decide between two starkly different versions of what happened that night			0
@entity53 told police that , after the two exchanged words , @entity3 went after him			1
according to his account , the teen , who did n't have any weapons on him , punched him , forced him to the ground , and slammed his head on the concrete			2
that 's when @entity53 shot @entity3 in self - defense , he claims			1
@entity3 's family and supporters , though , have long had a different story			1
one of the first to tell it was @entity16 , who initially addressed reporters last march 8 , trying to raise the case 's profile and hike pressure on authorities			2
he and , soon , others suggested @entity53 had targeted his son , an @entity172 youth wearing a hooded sweatshirt , because of his race			2
timeline of events in the @entity3 case the parents ' legion of supporters grew exponentially as the weeks wore on after the shooting , with no one charged			1
they created a petition on the website @entity184 calling for @entity53 's arrest			1
within a week , it was the second most - popular petition in the website 's history , with 877,110 signatures			2
protests drawing thousands of people sprung up nationwide demanding " justice for @entity3 " and blasting local authorities ' response			2
as their reason for not immediately arresting @entity53 , police cited @entity46 's " stand your ground " law , which states that people who feel threatened do n't have to retreat from danger and can use deadly force to protect themselves			1
@entity53 was charged on april 11 , with a probable cause affidavit stating he " profiled " @entity3 and disregarded a 911 dispatcher 's request that he wait for police			1
the weeks that followed produced more news			0
for example , @entity53 posted $ 150,000 bail , only to have it revoked after the judge said he 'd mislead the court about his financial situation , including tens of thousands of dollars he 'd raised online for his defense fund			1
opinion : @entity3 did not die in vain watch @entity219 weeknights 9 p.m. et. for the latest from @entity40 click here .			0
