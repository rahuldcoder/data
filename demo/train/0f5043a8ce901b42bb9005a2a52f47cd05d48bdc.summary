-- a powerful family accused in what is considered the worst politically motivated killings in recent @entity6 history has committed many other atrocities with impunity over two decades , a human rights group says			1
the @entity10 family and its forces are " one of the most powerful and abusive state - backed militias in the @entity6 , " says a new 96 - page report released by @entity15 , called " they own the @entity17			1
" the family 's " many abuses " include " more than 50 incidences of killings , torture , sexual assault , and abductions and disappearances , " according to the report			1
the executive secretary in the administration of former president @entity29 categorically denied the allegations leveled in the report , saying that the administration 's " earnestness to promote , protect and fulfill human rights has always been clear , and not even the unceasing efforts of critics , including ill - prepared reports , will diminish or discredit it			0
" @entity10 -- former mayor of @entity40 province and the son of a former provincial governor -- is now on trial , accused of being the ringleader in the political massacre in @entity40			1
@entity10 and his family have denied wrongdoing			1
dozens of people in a convoy were ambushed on november 23 , 2009 , and their bodies were buried in a mass grave			1
the wife and sister of a political rival of @entity10 's and 30 journalists were among the victims			1
there are 196 accused , about 500 witnesses and more than 11,000 murder charges involved in the massacre case , which is expected to take years			2
" in addition to the 58 killed in the @entity40 massacre , the family is implicated over the years in the killing of at least 56 people , including relatives of opposition politicians , landowners who resisted forced acquisition of their property , eyewitnesses to @entity10 crimes , including their own militia members , and even children , " the rights group 's report says			1
@entity15 said it interviewed approximately 50 victims of abuses , their family members and friends , and witnesses , in producing the report			2
" despite an initial flurry of activity after the november 23 killings , including some arrests , 126 suspects remain at large and the government 's prosecution remains woefully slow and limited , " the report says			0
" senior police and military officers who failed to act upon knowledge of @entity10 crimes have not been investigated ; investigations into the source of the family 's weapons have lacked transparency and independence ; and the national institutions responsible for accountability -- the @entity103 , the @entity104 , and the @entity105 -- have done nothing significant to address the situation			1
" " one year after the @entity40 massacre , the @entity108 remain a powerful and dangerous force with which to be reckoned			0
for more than two decades , the @entity108 operated unchecked by the national police , the military , and the @entity112 , which have not only failed to seriously investigate crimes allegedly committed by the family 's militia , but have even armed and worked alongside its members			2
" in the @entity15 report , authorities appeared stymied			0
" what can we do ? this is an influential family , " a police officer told the rights group			0
the @entity6 government did not immediately respond to @entity0 's phone and e-mail requests for comment , but a spokesman for the administration of president @entity131 sent a text message to the @entity133			2
" we 're working on it			0
the @entity10 case is being tried , the prosecution is serious			2
we 're quietly laying the groundwork for dismantling private armies , but some cases are harder to fix than others , " wrote spokesman @entity137 , according to the @entity133			0
also , general @entity142 , the former executive secretary of the @entity29 administration , disputed the report 's contention that his government was slow to prosecute the perpetrators			0
" within days , more than a hundred people were apprehended and charged , including members of the @entity10 family , not even sparing the patriarch @entity151 and his sons @entity151 and @entity153 who has since been relieved as @entity155 governor			1
and the trial goes on to this day			0
" he also challenged @entity15 to present evidence to back the allegation that the military armed the @entity108			0
" for all intents and purposes , this allegation must be addressed if only to spare the armed forces from being unnecessarily suspected of wrong - doing , better yet to come their self - defense , " he said			0
the 2009 political massacre shocked people even in a country that is familiar with election violence			1
the trial of @entity10 and his alleged accomplices has been delayed repeatedly , most recently because of a defense request for more preparation time			2
the delays have prompted outcries against the political influence of the @entity10 family			1
they have ruled @entity40 for two decades			0
@entity40 is part of an autonomous region in predominantly @entity155 , which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent @entity184 homeland in the predominantly @entity186 nation .			0
