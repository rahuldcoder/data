-- sen. @entity1 was ready for his close - up , and he got it			1
now you know what all the fuss is about			0
@entity1 , a rising star and possible 2016 @entity8 presidential hopeful , was picked to deliver the official @entity8 response to president @entity11 's @entity10			1
the selection tells you a lot about what the @entity8 has in store for @entity1 , and what this 41 - year - old son of @entity19 immigrants can do for a party that needs to become more user - friendly for @entity23			1
his remarks were also delivered in @entity25			0
@entity1 's delivery was solid , his voice strong , and his passion unmistakable			1
the senator from @entity30 is an excellent communicator whose life experience -- as the son of a bartender and hotel maid who worked hard so their children could get ahead -- is easy for many @entity39 to connect with			0
in the @entity8 , there are the multimillionaires -- and then there is @entity1			1
and the message that @entity1 sought to communicate tuesday night -- about how making @entity39 prosperous comes from growing the middle class , expanding opportunity and protecting economic freedom , and not from increasing the footprint of government -- came through loud and clear			1
@entity49 : @entity1 missed the year of the woman @entity1 knows that the @entity8 has a reputation as the party of the rich			1
that happens when you nominate as your party 's presidential candidate someone worth $ 250 million			1
so he had this message for @entity11 : " mr. president , i still live in the same working - class neighborhood i grew up in			1
my neighbors are n't millionaires			0
they 're retirees who depend on @entity64 and @entity65			0
they 're workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills			0
they 're immigrants , who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy			0
the tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle - class families			0
it will cost them their raises			0
it will cost them their benefits			0
it may even cost some of them their jobs			0
and it will hurt seniors because it does nothing to save @entity65 and @entity64			0
so mr. president , i do n't oppose your plans because i want to protect the rich			0
i oppose your plans because i want to protect my neighbors			0
" that is the sweet spot			0
@entity1 understands that the best hope of the @entity8 is for it to establish itself as the party not of the rich , but of those who aspire to one day be rich			1
and speaking of immigrants , @entity1 already has one accomplishment in that arena -- albeit an indirect one			2
@entity11 's supporters like to tout his announcement last june that his administration would offer young illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity39 as children the chance to avoid deportation by applying for deferred action and a temporary work permit			1
what they forget to mention is that the only reason that @entity11 did this was because @entity1 was working on a bill that would have offered this group of young people permanent relief by giving them legal status			1
@entity8 's @entity1 rips @entity11 now @entity1 is part of a bipartisan group of senators , the " group of eight , " that wants to tackle immigration reform by , among other things , offering the undocumented an earned pathway to citizenship			1
it 's not something that @entity1 -- who used to have the support of the tea party but no longer appears to , at least on immigration -- would have considered a few years ago			1
this is a kinder and gentler @entity1 , and also a wiser one			2
when he entered the @entity134 , he expressed support for the ghastly immigration law in @entity137 , which has served as a recipe for racial profiling of @entity23			2
he also opposed the @entity140 , which would have offered legal status to young illegal immigrants who went to college or joined the military			0
but in january 2012 , i saw @entity1 give a speech in @entity146 that gave me hope that he was coming around			2
he talked about how the @entity8 could not just be the party that opposed illegal immigration but also had to be the party that encouraged legal immigration			1
and he acknowledged something that too few republicans have the guts to admit -- that there are those in their party whose tone , on this issue , is much too mean and intolerant and divisive for their own good			2
talk back : is giving the @entity10 response a political ' kiss of death ' ? honestly , i do n't know how much of this is real and how much has been manufactured by @entity163 in advance of a possible run at the presidency			1
on immigration , there is a long list of politicians -- in both parties -- who have undergone extreme makeovers			0
@entity11 has been on multiple sides of the issue , deporting @entity140 one minute and offering them a reprieve the next			2
@entity1 would n't be the first to change his tune			2
overall , @entity1 established himself as a force to be reckoned with , in the @entity8 and beyond			1
his detractors -- most of them loyal @entity179 and @entity11 supporters -- were anxious to find fault with his remarks , but he gave them little to work with			2
there was that one awkward moment near the end where @entity1 , his voice cracking and his throat dry , quickly reached for a bottle of water			2
his critics joked that the gesture was such a terrible distraction that @entity39 should just ignore the whole speech			0
really ? the water did n't bother me			0
but @entity1 's remarks did make me thirsty for new leadership in the @entity198			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity1 presented @entity8 response to @entity11 's @entity10
@entity201 : @entity1 came across *positively* , appealing to broad range of people
he says @entity1 counters the *argument* that the @entity8 is the party of the *wealthy*
@entity201 : how much of @entity1 's switch on immigration is real ?
