-- it 's a plot twist that even a thriller writer might have struggled to come up with during @entity5 's @entity4 qualifying clash with @entity6 in @entity7			1
a drone flying a flag depicting the " @entity6 " over a major international soccer game tuesday was the subject of a ' whodunnit ' mystery after the brother of the @entity16 prime minister hit back at allegations by a @entity5 government official that he had been piloting the quadcopter			1
" i am very disgusted by the allegation of my having any involvement in the piloting of the drone , " @entity20 told @entity0 wednesday , who said he had been taking pictures of the game from a vip suite at the stadium			1
as a football match mushroomed into a diplomatic incident amid claim and counter-claim in a region of a world that is still riven by ethnic divisions , his version of events conflicted with @entity5 's version of events			1
" according to the information from the police he ( @entity20 ) was in possession of the navigator , " said a @entity5 official as the country 's football federation labeled the drone flight a " terrorist action planned in advance			1
" @entity52 has confirmed that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against both teams			0
the game was abandoned after 41 minutes with players clashing after the flag was taken down by a @entity5 player			1
@entity20 insisted the police 's actions were part of a @entity5 " plot , " after discovering he was the @entity16 prime minister 's brother			1
" there were 50 or so @entity16 guys who can say i did n't have the controller -- they searched everyone			0
" the @entity5 prime minister 's office also stated that @entity20 was arrested and sent home to @entity6 , a claim denied by the @entity16 government 's spokesman			1
" there is no proof whatsoever and @entity20 was never arrested in @entity7 , " @entity73 , communications director for the prime minister of @entity6 told @entity0			1
" he has nothing to do with the drone			2
" the contest , played at @entity81 's stadium in @entity7 , was abandoned near the end of the first half following ugly scenes involving fans and players			1
" when you have 32,000 people shouting kill , kill , kill @entity16 , it 's living in another dimension , " said @entity20			1
@entity16 players ran from the field , while a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters			0
images from photo agencies showed fans had invaded the pitch			0
" what happened last night in @entity7 is truly sad , " @entity73 told @entity0			1
" the @entity16 government firmly condemns the despicable expressions of racism and violence against the @entity16 national team players			0
" we put all of our trust in @entity52 to conduct a fair investigation which sheds light on the truth of all that happened in the @entity117 , from the start of our national anthem to the very last moment that our squad left the stadium , " added @entity73 referring to @entity4 football 's governing body			2
" @entity123 should never be mixed with politics and state politics can not be driven by what happens in a football match			0
" @entity73 believes the scenes witnessed in the @entity5 capital offer " further proof that the ghosts of the past " that still haunt the @entity131			2
" the false story that the @entity16 prime minister 's brother instigated the showdown of violence by launching a drone carrying a flag over the stadium , is a testament to the presence of harmful elements that wish to keep this region mired in the past , " said @entity73 , who explained @entity20 was one of a few dozen @entity16 who attended the game with valid tickets provided by the country 's football association			1
he says that the group were searched by police but not found to be carrying anything			0
" the @entity16 prime minister remains firmly committed to fostering this new , historical chapter of peace and cooperation , " said @entity73			1
" he will do all in his power to ensure it will not be closed by hatreds such as those which cast such a negative shadow on the football game			2
" @entity20 says that he was moved from the vip box for security reasons and informed the authorities that he held @entity166 citizenship before being given a police escort to waiting buses			2
" i tried with my broken @entity5 to understand what was happening , but they said this is orders , " he added			2
" i had no involvement in the drone			0
when the banner came up we had no idea , we thought some @entity5 set it up			2
" prime minister @entity20 is scheduled to arrive in @entity7 in the next few days -- the first such visit by an @entity16 leader in 68 years			1
in a statement on its website , @entity52 said that the match " was abandoned and the circumstances will be reported to the @entity184			0
" @entity52 spokesperson @entity186 told @entity0 an announcement on sanctions against both countries are expected to be made within a week			1
@entity6 's first visit to @entity7 since 1967 was expected to be a tense occasion , though the events of tuesday evening appeared to catch security authorities by surprise			1
the " @entity6 " insignia , which was attached to the drone , refers to the idea of an extended area in which all ethnic @entity16 reside -- one which would include @entity199			1
the two illustrated figures on the flag were @entity202 , an @entity16 nationalist who led uprisings against the @entity5 and @entity204 in 1912 and 1913 , while the other , @entity205 , is considered to be the founder of the modern @entity16 state , which became independent in 1912			1
the word " @entity212 , " which refers to an indigenous inhabitant of a place , was emblazoned at the bottom of the flag and is considered an offense to @entity5			1
when @entity5 player @entity216 ripped the flag down , it provided the catalyst for an already combustible tie to fully ignite			1
@entity16 players ran from the field , while a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters			0
images from photo agencies showed fans had invaded the pitch			0
@entity230 , the @entity231 referee , took the players off the field with the game goalless			0
" what happened is something we ca n't comprehend at the moment , " @entity5 captain @entity235 told reporters following the abandonment			1
" on behalf of my team , all i can say is that we wanted to carry on and that we shielded the @entity16 players every step of the way to the tunnel ( after the riot broke out )			0
" the @entity16 team said they were unfit physically and mentally to carry on after talking to the officials and they will now decide the fate of this match			0
" we can only regret that football took a back seat but it is difficult to draw any conclusions or make any comments now			0
" security had been tight in the lead up to the contest in @entity7 with away fans prevented from attending amidst heightening tensions over @entity199 -- a majority - @entity16 former @entity5 province which declared independence in 2008			2
in 1999 , a 78 - day air war was launched by @entity264 to stop the killing off ethnic @entity16 in @entity199 by @entity5 forces			2
@entity199 's independence is recognized by many countries including the @entity166 , the @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 -- but not @entity5			1
four of @entity6 's starting lineup were born in @entity199 , with @entity272 of @entity274 club @entity273 , goalkeeper @entity275 , midfielder @entity276 and @entity277			1
with @entity199 not recognized as a state by the @entity280 , it is unable to join @entity281 or @entity52 , meaning some of its players have adopted other countries			0
@entity284 , who plays his club football with @entity286 , represents @entity287 as does @entity288 and @entity289			0
while @entity199 is able to play friendly matches , the team can not compete in international competition			0
@entity294 - born @entity293 , one of the most exciting talents in the @entity296 with @entity297 , turned down the opportunity to play for @entity199 , where his father is from			0
he was also eligible for @entity6 through his mother 's lineage			1
" we came to @entity7 to play football , but we were physically attacked by the @entity5 supporters , " @entity272 told reporters on tuesday			2
" we just wanted to take the flag , and everything would be under control if the stadium security at the stadium had prevented the supporters from attacking our players			2
" i was defending my teammate , i have injuries to my face , as does @entity316			0
they asked us to play in front of empty stands ( instead of abandonment ) -- however , we did not feel good because of our injuries			0
" the two countries must now wait for @entity52 to make a decision on whether the game should be replayed			0
and what punishments are handed out			0
" it is a regretful situation on which we will report ; the referee , myself and the security adviser			0
the circumstances were such that we could n't continue the match , " @entity52 's match delegate , @entity329 told reporters			2
" you all saw what happened and i can not comment on who is to blame or what to blame			0
i will submit a report with my colleagues to @entity52 and @entity52 will decide what will happen further			0
