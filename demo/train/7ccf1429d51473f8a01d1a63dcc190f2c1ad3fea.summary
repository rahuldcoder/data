-- @entity3 's @entity2 images bear some similarities to 18th - century landscape paintings			1
the content is different , of course			2
what @entity3 's army of photo collectors captured at @entity10 on any given day in the 21st century will look different than what @entity12 painter @entity11 saw back in the 1700s			0
but they 're both a representation of an exact moment in time , which makes them a handy way to compare now and then if you can isolate the right locations			0
@entity21 has laid old paintings over @entity2 photographs to create a series of perspective - bending composite images of old and new @entity27			1
modern sculptures dominate a plaza that was once wide open ; neon signs reside on the same block as gas - lit streetlights ; and a bridge covers over a river that was once filled with sailboats			1
we 've seen projects similar to this before , but it works particularly well in a city like @entity27 , where history is built into infrastructure and architecture			1
buildings that existed in the 18th century are still standing today , which gives the images a ghostly feeling			1
it really is incredible how well paintings from artists like @entity11 and @entity50 reflect current - day @entity27			1

this is not product of @entity11 's paintbrush , but rather a perfectly - aligned placement of the photograph @entity3 shot more than 250 years later			2
it looks like it could be the same exact tree , though we know it 's not			0
still , it 's fun to imagine that people have been stopping for shade under those very leaves for centuries			0
this idea then , is the coolest part of mash - ups like @entity21 's : it makes you realize that despite all of the ways cities have changed over the years , maybe some things are n't really that different after all			2
sure , the little girl standing in the middle of @entity91 's 1888 painting of @entity92 in @entity93 maybe never existed , and if she did she has since been replaced with a bike lane and stop lights , but the general purpose of the space has remained essentially the same			0
