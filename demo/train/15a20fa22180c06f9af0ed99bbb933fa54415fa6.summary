the prices may look tempting , but ordering from an online pharmacy is often a bad deal , according to @entity3 and the @entity4 , announcing a crackdown thursday on thousands of websites			1
the @entity4 said it has shut down 1,677 sites for selling counterfeit or substandard medication , or for selling drugs without appropriate safeguards			1
other sites received regulatory warnings			1
officials said they also arrested 58 people and seized more than $ 41 million worth of illegal medicines			1
several sites had sleek interfaces and names that could easily be confused with legitimate pharmacy retailers			1
for example , the @entity4 shuttered @entity22 ; the well - known drugstore chain 's website is actually @entity25			1
" it impacts consumers every day , " @entity4 commissioner @entity26 told @entity28 's dr. @entity27			1
" these products can have none of the active ingredient that people need for the treatment of their disease			1
they can have too much or too little ( of the ingredient ) ; they can have toxic ingredients , and they can prevent patients form getting the actual medications that they badly need to treat their disease			0
" the most common scams advertised popular drugs such as @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			0
the recent crackdown , labeled @entity49 , involved the cooperation of more than 100 countries , according to @entity3			0
@entity52 acknowledged it 's difficult to know the scope of the online pharmacy problem but maintained , " we still do have the safest drug supply in the world			2
" at some locations , @entity4 and customs agents use handheld scanners with ultraviolet and infrared radiation to detect suspicious packaging and ingredients			1
confirmation of whether a product contains fake ingredients must be done in a laboratory			0
the scanners are in use at a handful of locations that handle a large volume of imports such as the @entity76			0
the @entity4 also works closely with private pharmaceutical companies , such as @entity78 , that run investigations and turn over evidence to law enforcement			1
@entity78 declined to say how much it spends on tracking counterfeits or how many people are working on the investigations			2
counterfeits are not isolated to online sales , and it is extremely difficult to know how many deaths and serious illnesses they cause			0
unless a patient 's adverse reaction is dramatic , the medication is usually not tested , so the vast majority of counterfeit ingredients likely go unnoticed			1
but many experts agree the problem is daunting			0
the @entity98 recently performed an analysis of more than 10,000 websites , and found that 97 % did not fully comply with state and federal regulations			2
it said 88 % did not require a valid prescription , and almost half sold medicines lacking @entity4 approval			1
" it 's probably a multibillion dollar industry , " said @entity107 , executive director of the pharmacy board group			2
@entity107 said most of these sites are based overseas , with a common scam of site operators presenting themselves as @entity114 to lure @entity116 customers seeking more affordable medication from a trusted place			1
" the fact of the matter is very few , if any , of these sites are actually based in @entity114 or ( are ) @entity114 , " @entity107 said			2
" in fact , they are located in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , around the world			0
" the @entity98 's website features a list of approved online pharmacies as well as those to avoid			0
@entity52 said consumers should also watch for a few warning signs			0
" no. 1 , the websites should ask for a valid prescription			2
if they do n't -- beware			0
" she also said website pharmacies should have a licensed pharmacist available for consultation and should be located in the @entity116 and licensed in the state where the website is registered			0
beyond that , she said , the basics still apply			0
" if the costs are really low , if it seems too good to be true , it is too good to be true , " she said .			0
