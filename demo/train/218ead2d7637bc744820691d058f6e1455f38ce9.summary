any publicity is good publicity for @entity2 - based budget airline @entity1			1
the no - frills airline recently announced plans to cut down to just one toilet per aircraft ( see below ) , and that had us wondering : are announcements like their toilet fee and " fat tax " tasteless marketing ploys , or is @entity1 ceo @entity13 just really cheap ? despite wanting to strip their passengers of basic comforts like toilets and seat pockets , @entity1 is doing good business			1
comparing september 2011 with september 2010 , @entity1 reported a 6 percent hike in passenger numbers , from 6.84 million to 7.25 million			2
through september 2011 , the airline carried 76.8 million passengers , reported the airline			2
the airline 's website also claims that in 2010 , profits rose 26 percent to more than € 401m ( us $ 551m ) despite higher fuel prices , the global recession , and volcanic ash disruptions in the spring			2
@entity1 's high booking fees and ancillary charges include : £ 30 ( us $ 41 ) to check in a bag , £ 10 ( us $ 14 ) to pay for flights with a debit or credit card ( excluding @entity36 ) and £ 60 ( us $ 83 ) to check in sports or music equipment , according to the @entity39			1
@entity40 : @entity42 's 50 best beaches so , to honor the success of the self - proclaimed " world 's favorite airline " let 's take a look at some of its most ingenious money - saving tactics			1
one toilet per aircraft in october 2011 , @entity1 expressed its intolerance for people with bladders			2
the budget airline announced that it would remove two or three toilets from its aircraft to make room for six extra seats			1
up to 200 passengers and six crew would share a bathroom during the flight , reported the @entity66			0
@entity13 said , " we very rarely use all three toilets on board our aircraft anyway			0
" but apparently he is doing us all a favor			0
the move " would fundamentally lower air fares by about 5 percent for all passengers , cutting £ 2 ( us $ 3 ) from a typical £ 40 ( us $ 63 ) ticket			0
currently , there is no legal stipulation for an airline to provide toilets on its aircraft , but @entity1 has not announced a date to implement the plan			1

charging £ 1 for toilets the toilet removal was n't a surprise to passengers and critics because @entity13 announced in 2010 that @entity1 would charge £ 1 or € 1 for passengers to use the toilet			1
@entity94 , spokesperson for the airline , told @entity96 : " by charging for the toilets we are hoping to change passenger behavior so that they use the bathroom before or after the flight , " according to the @entity66			2
but as of 2011 , @entity13 said the plans to " charge a pound to spend a penny " have now been dropped			0
standing room only looking more and more like cheap suburban public transport , @entity1 announced in july 2010 it was preparing for standing - room - only seats at the back of its 250 - strong fleet			1
a spokesman for @entity1 said that @entity114 had been consulted over refitting the fleet with " vertical seats			1
" passengers would be strapped in while standing up , and tickets for these seats would cost between £ 4 ( us $ 6 ) and £ 8 ( us $ 13 )			1
here 's a video of their design			0
however , a spokesman for the @entity124 said the plans would struggle to meet safety requirements			0
the unnamed spokesman said : " it 's aviation law that people have to have a seat belt on for take - off and landing so they would have to be in a seat			2
i do n't know how mr. @entity13 would get around that one			0
during turbulence passengers also have to have a seat belt on			0
" in response to criticism for the idea , technological determinist @entity13 suggested haters were a bunch of @entity142 who could n't groove with the changes			0
" people are always slow to accept the changes that face the aviation industry , even though it is already almost unrecognizable from 20 to 30 years ago , " said a @entity1 spokesman , as reported by the @entity146			2

charging for overweight passengers backpackers around the world put down their @entity157 gelato when they heard about @entity1 's " fat tax			1
" the airline asked passengers on its website whether or not they should charge for " very large passengers			0
" " over 100,000 passengers logged on to @entity1 to take part in our competition and almost one in three ( over 30,000 ) think that very large passengers should be asked to pay a fat tax			1
the revenues from any such ' fat tax ' will be used to lower the airfares for all @entity1 passengers yet further , " @entity1 's @entity94 said			1
this time the plan did not go ahead , not out of ethical considerations but because it would be hard to collect the money and would make boarding much slower			0
charging extra £ 40 to print boarding passes @entity1 currently charges passengers £ 40 ( us $ 63 ) to print their boarding pass at the airport			1
the charge was intended to speed up the check - in process			0
in january 2011 , a passenger took the budget airline to court over the charge in @entity187			1
in october 11 2011 , the @entity188 ruled that @entity1 's boarding card was perfectly legal in accordance with @entity187 and @entity192 law			1
the airline 's smug response to the verdict on their website was that " less than 1 percent of passengers pay this boarding card reissue penalty which applies only in those rare cases where passengers fail to comply with their agreement , given at the time of booking			2
" passengers can avoid the reissue penalty by checking in online before leaving for the airport .			0
