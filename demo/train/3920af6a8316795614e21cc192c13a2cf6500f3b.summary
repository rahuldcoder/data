-- @entity1 routed @entity2 sunday 43 - 8 in one of the most one - sided contests in @entity6 history to win the coveted @entity7 for the first time			1
@entity10 champion @entity2 was undone by a toxic combination of @entity13 's ruthless defense and its own errors , with famed quarterback @entity15 having a night to forget			1
he was intercepted twice as @entity13 took an early stranglehold on the game while his inexperienced opposite @entity19 hardly put a foot wrong in an assured display			1
@entity25 to the powerful running , epitomized by inspired wide receiver @entity23 , the result was five touchdowns to a single score by @entity2 and the contest was effectively over by halftime as the @entity30 champions took complete control			1
by then linebacker @entity32 had intercepted a wayward @entity15 pass to return 69 yards and he was to be named @entity34 although in truth there were many candidates for the honor			2
" this is an amazing team , " @entity1 coach @entity39 said			2
" these guys would never take anything but winning this game			0
" @entity19 , 25 , was answering his critics in only his second year in the @entity45			0
" it feels great to win this title , " he said			0
the franchise owner @entity48 , the @entity49 co-founder , said it was an " amazing feeling " to win the 48th edition of the @entity6			0
@entity13 had been beaten in its only previous @entity6 appearance by @entity53 in 2006			2
fears of freezing conditions which had dominated the pre-match talk proved unfounded with the kickoff temperature of 49 degrees ( @entity58 ) positively balmy			0
it was 10 degrees warmer than the coldest - ever @entity6 from 1972 in @entity60 , but @entity15 and his team were caught cold from the very start			1
@entity2 made a hash of its first offensive drive			2
@entity2 center @entity66 's snap flew over @entity15 's head and @entity69 was forced to dive on the ball in his own end zone for a safety and two points for @entity13			1
@entity15 shook his head as he returned to the bench and he proceeded to spend much of the opening quarter warming his seat as @entity13 took a stranglehold			1
but the @entity2 defense held up well to at least deny @entity13 a touchdown , the further scoring coming from a pair of field goals from @entity85 to make it 8 - 0			1
towards the end first quarter @entity15 was intercepted by @entity13 safety @entity88 at the @entity2 39			1
it eventually led to the first touchdown for @entity13 as @entity92 forced his way over from close range , showing typical strength			0
it got worse for the 37 - year - old veteran manning as @entity13 pressure forced him into another errant and off balance pass which was intercepted by @entity32			2
he ran it back 69 yards for the second td for the @entity1 and with the extras from @entity104 it was 22 - 0 at the half			2
it was scarcely believable that a team which had set an @entity45 scoring record with 606 points in regular season had failed to make a 20 - yard play during the opening half and @entity6 history was against a team coming back from such a deficit			0
@entity2 was left with 30 minutes to reflect on its disastrous start as @entity118 singer @entity117 delighted 82,000 fans in the @entity120 in the much vaunted halftime show			0
the clean cut @entity123 rounded off his solo act with his song " @entity126 " before being joined by rockers the @entity128 for their " @entity130 " -- which ironically summed up some of @entity2 's efforts on the pitch			0
the combination certainly did rock but the corporations paying up to $ 4 million for an advertising slot during the @entity6 must have been hoping for a revival by the @entity2 for fear of the team 's supporters switching off their televisions in disgust			0
it got even worse straight from the kickoff as the quicksilver @entity23 returned for fully 87 yards for the @entity1 to effectively end the game as a contest			0
@entity23 had played only two games all season after injury , but danced through a jaded @entity2 defense to score his team 's third and decisive touchdown			2
@entity13 quarterback @entity19 had played a quietly effective game and his pass found @entity158 , who eluded some more weak defense to add the fourth td towards the end of the third quarter before @entity163 finally got @entity2 on the scoreboard			1
he picked off a pass from @entity15 -- his 12th catch a @entity6 record -- but it was to prove too little too late as his team trailed 36 - 8 going into the final quarter			1
a chance to salvage further pride was snuffed out at the start of the fourth when @entity19 found @entity175 just short of the end zone and he wriggled his way through			0
it completed the scoring with the @entity13 celebrations started well in advance of the final whistle -- coach @entity39 getting the traditional dowsing from his charges			0
by contrast , it proved a miserable night for his @entity2 counterpart @entity188 , whose hopes of a reported $ 1 million winning bonus were in tatters almost from the first play , while the result will throw @entity15 's future in doubt , with talk of retirement .			1
