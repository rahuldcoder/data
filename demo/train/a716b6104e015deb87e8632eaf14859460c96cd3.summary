-- when he got a concussion playing football in junior high , @entity1 did n't even see a doctor			1
no one cautioned him about the dangers of repeated head trauma in sports			1
he stopped playing that day and suffered headaches , but came back to the field a couple of days later			2
" that would have been in the early ' 80s , and we certainly did n't know half of what we know now about the injury , " he said			2
@entity1 , 45 , dedicated his career to discovering and harnessing knowledge about head injuries			1
now , he 's a highly regarded concussion expert and the recipient of $ 500,000 from the @entity22			1
he is one of 22 distinguished individuals to receive the no - strings - attached award , informally called the " genius grant , " for 2011			2
his research on retired sports players shows that repeated head injuries in sports increase the risk of memory loss , depression and other long - term consequences			1
in fact , in july , 75 former professional football players said they were suing the @entity37 , accusing it of hiding that information			2
figuring he would n't make it big - time in football ( or his other interests , baseball and tennis ) , @entity1 got interested in sports medicine as a way to use other skills while remaining involved in athletics			1
in junior high , he took an introductory sports medicine course over the summer at @entity50 and became a student athletic trainer in high school			2
" it 's a bit scary how little i knew then , but i thought i knew everything			0
and here i am 30 years later , certainly very happy that i stayed with that passion , " he said			0
he worked as a graduate student athletic trainer with the @entity58 while earning his master 's at the @entity60 , which he completed in 1992 , and came to realize just how little was known about concussions			0
" it was pretty much a guessing game about whether someone was ready to play again			0
it 's such a subjective injury , " he said			0
he went on to get his ph.d. at the @entity66 , where he got involved with technologies for more objectively assessing concussions			0
in 1995 , he came to the @entity69 , where he is the chairman of the @entity70 and @entity71			0
@entity1 sees his work as piecing together a puzzle : preventing , diagnosing and treating concussions are all pieces that he wants to fit together			1
he and colleagues developed the @entity77 , a cost - effective tool that is being widely used in scholastic athletics for diagnosing and managing concussions			0
athletes are asked to stand in three different ways on both firm and foam surfaces , and an athletic trainer or other clinician follows the guidebook to rate their balance			2
it 's a quick way to assess damage from a head injury , because concussions often affect balance , especially in the first days after the impact			1
my concussion : be nice to your brain @entity1 's group has proposed that all student athletes get a baseline test -- that is , an evaluation when they are healthy -- so if they do suffer a head injury , medical professionals can compare their performance after impact to the scores from when they were healthy			1
part of that is the @entity77			0
memory testing and self - reporting of symptoms are also taken into account , so clinicians have a clear idea of what the athlete 's functioning is like normally vs. after a concussion			1
another tool he 's exploring is a helmet with a built - in accelerometer , called the @entity123			0
it allows clinicians to see on a computer exactly how hard a player was hit			0
analyzing the information from this helmet also helps clinicians see exactly where and in what ways players get hit , so they can make recommendations about how to avoid concussions in the future			0
athletes can be taught how not to lead with their heads inappropriately and to position their bodies better to withstand an impact , @entity1 said			1
there is no concussion - proof helmet , and there wo n't be for many years , but in the meantime @entity1 urges a focus on behavior modification			1
only about one of every 15 concussion patients get a ct scan at @entity69 , @entity1 said , and the ones who do get imaged are athletes who report worsening symptoms , such as headache and light sensitivity , which could signal a brain bleed			1
@entity1 and colleagues are also using a newer imaging technique called diffusion tensor imaging , a type of magnetic resonance imaging that lets doctors look at how water diffuses in the brain 's white matter tracts			1
it can show areas where neurons have been disrupted			0
the use of this technique for concussions is still being analyzed			0
major sports groups such as the @entity37 , the @entity172 and the @entity173 have done a better job of increasing awareness about concussions over the last few years , @entity1 said			1
" i think we 're certainly in a better position today to educate athletes and prevent these catastrophic outcomes because of some of the initiatives they put in place , " he said			0
the @entity37 , for example , has instituted a new rule that kickoffs must be moved from the 30 - yard line to the 35 - yard line			0
this distance adjustment would theoretically reduce the number of high - speed collisions at kickoff			0
although there is some skepticism about this , @entity1 is confident that there will be fewer concussions this season as a result			1
after the blow in junior high school , @entity1 suffered two concussions as an adult : one in a cycling accident and , most recently , on a roller coaster			1
just as his own research suggested , having had two concussions in the past made him more susceptible to a third			2
but because he is not additionally exposed to repeated smaller head injuries the way contact sports players are , he 's hopeful he is n't at as high a risk of memory loss and other symptoms			1
it might come as a surprise that @entity1 puts no restrictions on the contact sports playing of his four children -- 11 , 13 , and 15 - year - old boys , and a 4 - year - old girl			1
the boys have already played a lot of football , including tackle football			0
their dad wants them to learn the skills early so they 'll be able to protect themselves better later in their teens , when they 're more susceptible to more serious injuries			2
" many of my friends think i 'm crazy for allowing it , but i 'm also out there helping to educate parents about this , so i 'm hopeful that we 're making a difference , " he said			0
" if we can see it happening in a positive way in one community , it can be extended to the next community			0
" as for what he 'll do with the grant , @entity1 wants to develop rehabilitation protocols , not just for athletes with head injuries but also for soldiers , since there has been a documented similarity between blast injuries and sports concussions			1
coincidentally , he had scheduled a meeting with a military group on tuesday to discuss possibilities , unrelated to the announcement of the award			2
" i also hope that our @entity262 award will allow us to explore creative ways to expand that work for youth athletes , and helping to protect them as they move up through the ranks , " he said .			2

@entity1 has won a @entity22 award for concussion research
his research found head injuries increase risk of memory loss , depression
he also helped develop a *system* to measure balance before and after concussion
