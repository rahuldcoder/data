@entity0 -- prosecutors in @entity0 on thursday accused three @entity4 financial institutions of money laundering that benefited the militant group @entity6 , and they demanded forfeitures and penalties totaling hundreds of millions of dollars			1
a civil action alleges that hundreds of millions of dollars in drug profits and other money were laundered through the @entity12 as well as two exchange houses			1
the primary method , it alleges , was by mingling that cash with the finances of legitimate businesses -- primarily a network of about 30 @entity21 - based car exporters , who shipped more than $ 1 billion worth of cars from the @entity21 to @entity24 for sale			0
it said dealers in about 10 states were involved , but there was no evidence the @entity21 - based businesses were aware of the @entity6 connection			1
prosecutors said in their announcement , " cash from the sale of the cars in @entity24 was mixed with proceeds from narcotics trafficking , and then transferred to @entity4 through ( @entity6 ) - controlled money - laundering channels , " and " part of the proceeds was used to support ( @entity6 )			1
" the filing says the bank permitted @entity6 - related entities to move as much as $ 260,000 a day through their accounts , without disclosing the source or purpose of the money			1
in february , the @entity50 designated the @entity12 as a " financial institution of primary money laundering concern			1
" since then , the bank has been acquired by the subsidiary in @entity4 of @entity54			0
before the acquisition , the accused bank had 35 branches in @entity4 and had grown in recent years from assets of $ 2.83 billion in 2005 to $ 5.18 billion in 2009			1
prosecutors on thursday demanded the bank 's assets be forfeited due to the alleged wrongdoing			1
the chairman of @entity12 , @entity64 , told @entity1 on thursday , " we deny any relation whatsoever with @entity6			1
" he said that the before the bank 's sale , " all the accounts were scrutinized , through three international auditors			1
we did n't have any evidence backing all these allegations			0
" he added that the bank had used safeguards to prevent transactions by known money launders			2
" we never had any transaction or any connection with any name which was blacklisted			0
the moment a name appeared on the screen , we froze the account , " he said			0
@entity1 was not able to reach @entity6 officials immediately for comment			2
but the group 's chief political strategist , speaking to the @entity87 this week , said the group had no relationship to the @entity12 and dismissed the @entity21 allegations of a drug connection as politically motivated propaganda			1
on tuesday , prosecutors in @entity94 also indicted a @entity4 man they allege was at the center of the laundering network and who they say has ties to @entity6 -- although he is not a member of the group			1
they assert that @entity102 coordinated the smuggling and sale of at least 90 tons of cocaine destined for the @entity21 and laundered hundreds of millions of dollars for drug gangs in @entity107 and @entity108 such as the notorious @entity109			0
according to the indictment , @entity102 laundered as much as $ 200 million a month and made bulk cash deliveries to @entity112 in amounts as high as $ 4 million			0
" he moved the money , " said @entity114 , the @entity115 agent who coordinated the @entity117 investigation			0
" he could n't have survived without @entity6			2
and he was a source of revenue for @entity6			2
" @entity102 is not in custody , and officials would only say they believe him to be in the @entity123			0
@entity6 , which the @entity21 has designated a terrorist organization , is an influential member of the government in @entity4			2
but it also has a history of terror attacks against @entity21 interests , dating back to the bombing of the @entity131 in 1983			0
now @entity6 may be using criminal proceeds to help pay for its militant operations , according to @entity115 agent @entity134			2
" the worldwide demand for drugs is actually helping terror groups fund their activities , " @entity134 said			0
" and these groups want to destroy @entity112			0
" @entity140 , an @entity141 terror finance analyst who is with the @entity142 , said , " @entity6 can do a lot of damage , and the more money that rolls in , the more problematic that will be			2
" you have an organization right now that has been operating a massive criminal enterprise , " he said , " and using that money to further its aims in the region -- which is about creating a little mini-state inside of @entity4 , amassing weapons , threatening @entity154 , providing assistance to the insurgency in @entity157 , providing assistance to other terrorist organizations around the world			0
" @entity140 said this week 's allegations raised concerns about how many other unseen activities -- financial or military -- @entity6 may be conducting			1
but the recent moves by prosecutors against @entity6 's money supply could take a toll on the militant group 's potency , he said -- along with a reduction in funds from its main backers , @entity175 and @entity176 , in the wake of tightened international sanctions			1
" their arm gets a little bit shorter , " he said , " and their influence begins to wane just a little bit			0
" @entity1 's @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
