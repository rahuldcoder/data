@entity0 , @entity1 -- the political turmoil in @entity5 and @entity6 has @entity8 tour operators scrambling to divert package tours to more stable destinations , and several thousand tourists have already been re-routed to beaches in @entity1 , a @entity1 tourism industry official told @entity2			1
" we ca n't be happy about unfortunate circumstances elsewhere , " said @entity13 , president of the @entity14 of @entity15			0
" but the increase ( in tourists ) has arrived at an important moment " as @entity1 recovers from a deep economic slump			1
in addition to the few thousand extra @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 holidaymakers who 've already arrived in @entity1 's @entity29 , predictions are there could be tens of thousands of additional vacationers by may , @entity22 said			2
for now , the seven - island @entity29 archipelago , located in the @entity34 just west of @entity35 , is the only part of @entity1 that can compete directly with @entity5 and @entity6 for the beach vacation business in winter			0
but if the political uncertainty continues in @entity40 into the spring and summer , the package tours diverted from those destinations to @entity1 's @entity43 coast and islands could involve hundreds of thousands of additional tourists this year , @entity22 said			1
@entity6 's beaches have been a prime destination for @entity49 tourists , @entity22 said , and some of them could be diverted to @entity1 's coasts by next summer as well			2
@entity54 and @entity8 tourists who had holiday tours set for @entity5 or @entity6 may instead go in greater numbers to @entity57 , @entity22 said , based on information that he said is making the rounds among tour operators and travel agencies			0
@entity5 had nearly 12 million international tourist arrivals in 2009 , compared with nearly 7 million for @entity6 , and 52 million for @entity1 , which is among the world 's top four tourist destinations , along with @entity49 , the @entity66 and @entity67 , the @entity62 reports			1
@entity1 's @entity29 had 11 million tourists , including foreigners and @entity1 , in 2010 , a three percent increase over 2009			2
the extra tourists now diverted from @entity5 and @entity6 are helping the @entity29 to recover , said @entity22 , who is based in @entity72 on the @entity74 island			0
but diverting package tours from @entity40 to @entity1 or other locations is not always an instant maneuver			0
a package tour in the @entity29 costs about 30 percent more than a similar beach holiday in @entity5 or @entity6 , @entity22 said			0
so hard - fought negotiations over prices have ensued , in which the @entity1 hotel operators may agree to a lower price which still turns out to be more than the tour operator and individual tourist were going to pay in @entity5 or @entity6 , @entity22 said .			1

@entity1 is one of the top four tourist destinations
thousands more tourists could be *rerouted* to @entity1 this year
the numbers could boost the @entity1 economy
hotel *owners* may have to agree to less *expensive* rates
