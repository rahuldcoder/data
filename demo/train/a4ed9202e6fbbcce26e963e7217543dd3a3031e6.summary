-- a unified lawsuit on behalf of more than 2,000 @entity3 players has been filed against the league in federal court , alleging that the @entity3 failed to acknowledge and address neurological risks associated with the sport and then deliberately failed to tell players about the risks they faced , according to attorneys representing former players			1
the complaint , filed in federal court in @entity14 , unites the more than 80 pending lawsuits filed against the @entity3			1
" i firmly believe the @entity3 could have and should have done more to protect @entity17			1
that 's why i am seeking to hold the @entity3 accountable , " said @entity18 , widow of former @entity21 safety @entity19 , who committed suicide in april after years with dementia			1
" having lived through @entity17 's struggle , i desperately hope and pray others can be spared the pain and suffering we have endured -- and still endure every day			0
" @entity3 spokesman @entity30 acknowledged the filing but added that there was nothing new to the claim other than that it merges them all			1
" our legal team will review today 's filing that is intended to consolidate plaintiffs ' existing claims into one ' master ' complaint , " he said			2
" the @entity3 has long made player safety a priority and continues to do so			2
any allegation that the @entity3 sought to mislead players has no merit			2
it stands in contrast to the league 's many actions to better protect players and advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions			0
" however , many @entity3 players have claimed that they suffer from a variety of injuries because of concussions without really knowing the severity of how badly they could be hurt playing the game			0
" the @entity3 must open its eyes to the consequences of its actions , " said @entity66 , a former running back for the @entity67 and @entity68 who has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis			0
" the @entity3 has the power not only to give former players the care they deserve , but also to ensure that future generations of football players do not suffer the way that many in my generation have			0
" lawyers representing the players cited " dementia , depression , reduced cognitive ability , sleeplessness , early - onset alzheimer 's , and a debilitating and latent disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy " as some of the specific injuries caused by head trauma in the @entity3			0
" instead of protecting the health of its players , the @entity3 's response to this epidemic of brain injuries was to engage in a campaign of deceit and deception , actively concealing the risks players faced from repetitive impacts , " said @entity95 and @entity96 , co-lead counsels for the former players			1
" this case is about providing security and care to former @entity3 players who have suffered these devastating neurologic injuries , and making the game safer for generations to come			0
