-- " @entity1 " is the perfect name for @entity4 's summer tour , which kicked off with last night 's sold - out gig at @entity7 's 1st @entity6			1
beyond just the volume of the show -- which was considerable -- the theme prevailed through the set , built around a giant speaker cabinet ; the costumes ( mostly neon and shiny ) ; and the entire production itself : a gloriously over-the - top spectacle perfectly befitting the singer , who seems to produce chart - toppers by the dozen			0
the show began with a blitzkrieg of video , as four hanging , shifting circular video screens joined four giant stationary ones is projecting @entity4 's arrival			2
she wore an electric blue mini-trenchcoat and hot pink stilleto boots with neon green heels and immediately belted out her @entity32 hit , " @entity33 ) " from her 2010 album , also titled " @entity1			0
" photos : @entity4 's best looks before the audience could catch its breath , the singer had tossed the trench , revealing a day - glo bikini , picked up a gang of matching day - glo - covered back - up dancers and shifted directly into " @entity45 , " another @entity32 hit , this one from 2007 's " @entity47 " -- and then seamlessly segued into another hit , 2007 's " @entity54 , " replete with back - up dancers dressed as crash - test dummies bashing a neon - graffiti - covered car with bats			1
over nearly two hours -- a very long set for such a busy production -- @entity4 maintained a relentless pace , working her way through 24 songs , six different wardrobes and endless set changes , all without any significant energy dip			1
the deft production included several built - in musical and video interludes -- including a staggering number of guitar solos -- to keep from going dark during the changes			0
excerpts from @entity4 's @entity0 @entity69 one of the most impressive spectacles was a very erotic s&m - themed mini-set , launched with a fairly faithful cover of @entity74 's " @entity73 , " during which @entity4 , dressed in a tuxedo and toting a cane , spanked , groped and pretended to smack three nearly nude female dancers			1
by the time she had transitioned into " @entity1 's " " s&m " -- another @entity32 hit -- @entity4 's tux had been stripped off to reveal a white bondage corset and she was wearing handcuffs			1
nearly nude men and a female audience member were added to the mix before the whole thing ended ( cutely ) in a pillow fight			0
in a military - themed mini-set including 2009 hit " @entity90 , " @entity4 rode in atop a double - barreled pink tank that shot t - shirts into the crowd , flanked by sexy - soldier costumed dancers with pink rifles			1
when " @entity99 " segued into " glamorous life , " the singer barreled to the back of the arena , where she rode a platform revealing @entity104 stand - up drums and played an impressive solo			2
video : @entity4 's @entity108 cover shoot soon , she was on to outfit six -- a gold lamé mini-dress -- and her encore , which moved from her @entity32 hit with @entity112 , " @entity113 , " to her @entity32 hit with @entity115 , " @entity116			2
" it was understated compared to the rest of the show -- with only a squadron of tuxedoed back - up dancers and a blizzard of pink confetti -- but it was impressive that she was still singing and dancing at such a pace			2
it was a even more remarkable that there were still more huge hits left to play			0
she did each one proud			0
