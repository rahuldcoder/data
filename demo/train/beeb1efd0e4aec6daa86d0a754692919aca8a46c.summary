-- @entity1 , @entity2 and the @entity3 are not the @entity5 - friendly images usually associated with @entity6			1
but in a small corner of @entity8 , a surprising display of unofficial @entity11 diplomacy seems to fly in the face of official @entity14 rhetoric			1
visitors to @entity18 , in the west of the capital , are greeted with numerous images of @entity11 characters , as well as other familiar @entity5 cartoon characters such as @entity22			1
elsewhere , outside of the city , is another unexpected sight : a club dedicated to the @entity5 - invented @entity28 people transporters			0
for roller coaster obsessive and self - styled " @entity37 " @entity31 , who toured @entity8 's funfairs last month , the presence of these @entity5 icons offered more thrills than the rides on offer			1
" you see badly - copied mickeys and @entity40 all over the world , for example in copycat theme parks in rural @entity44 , but i did n't expect to see @entity22 and @entity28 in @entity6 , " @entity31 told @entity0			1
a @entity46 citizen now living in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity31 , 32 , could be forgiven for having preconceptions when visiting @entity6			1
nuclear ambitions , major protests after president @entity52 's disputed 2009 election victory and frequent reports of repression have all done little for the country 's global reputation			0
but , says @entity31 -- whose four - year quest to visit all the world 's major theme parks has so far taken him to 150 on five continents -- the @entity6 he encountered seemed a world away from the grim headlines			1
he says the @entity6 he encountered were " open - minded , unprejudiced , hospitable , warm and cultured , " sharing views that appeared to contrast with those expressed by the country 's leaders			2
" what surprised me is that i did n't even get the slightest cultural shock			0
the @entity6 i met made me feel like i was in @entity72 , " he said			2
his views reflect a 2008 @entity75 survey that claims ordinary @entity6 people are largely open to contacts with @entity78			2
nevertheless , countries such as @entity80 and the @entity5 , which has no diplomatic relations with @entity8 , caution against travel there			2
international sanctions in place against @entity6 also mean western companies can not operate easily in the country			2
whereas on the streets of @entity8 , @entity5 icons such as the @entity89 are used to create striking @entity14 graffiti , @entity31 witnessed @entity1 and his pals being pressed into far less sinister tasks			1
at @entity18 , @entity1 simply welcomes people to the funfair , while the @entity3 urge people to enjoy themselves			0
@entity22 offers tickets to ride and @entity2 helpfully points to the exit			0
as with his other experiences of places including @entity101 , @entity31 says @entity6 's theme parks offer a glimpse of the country 's citizens as they relax and forget their day - to - day concerns , even if the rides struggle to merit the low admission fees			1
" i highly recommend @entity6 as a place to visit			0
it 's a beautiful country with fantastic people			0
the local amusement parks provide great opportunity to mingle with locals			1
" sadly , with their rusting roller coasters and " drainingly dull " side shows , not even the presence of @entity1 , @entity22 and the @entity3 could save @entity6 's theme parks from rating badly on @entity31 's score card			1
he says one ride , in which visitors are squeezed into a car shaped like a soda can before being hurtled around a cramped roller coaster circuit , could be world - beatingly bad			0
" the yellow soda can - shaped roller coaster in @entity18 -- i 'm still trying to find out who the manufacturer was , even my specialist friends do n't know -- was maybe the worst i have ever experienced			0
the loop is the tightest i have ever seen and the vehicle 's headrests are too low to keep your head stable			0
you can hear the riders ' joyful screams rise when the coaster plunges into the loop and vanish within a second once they enter the murderous brain - turner itself			0
" it was genuinely unpleasant and leaves you with some neck pain to remember			0

@entity11 characters make unexpected appearances all over @entity8 's amusement parks
theme park expert @entity31 says @entity6 is home to one of the world 's worst roller coasters
@entity31 has visited 150 theme parks on five continents
