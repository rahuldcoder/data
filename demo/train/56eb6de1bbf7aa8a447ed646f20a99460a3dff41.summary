@entity0 -- elections to select @entity0 's top official , known as the chief executive , are supposed to be predictable			1
an election committee of 1,200 @entity0 people , drawn largely from pro-business , pro-establishment circles , cast their ballots and @entity10 's preferred candidate wins with a healthy majority			1
the city - state returned to @entity10 sovereignty in 1997 , though as a @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , which means it retains a high level of autonomy , only ceding control of foreign relations and defense matters to @entity21			0
the city has developed into one of the world 's great financial centers			0
@entity0 's seven million residents do not get to vote but the winning candidate is supposed to be " acceptable " to them			1
the entire process is designed to avoid unpleasant surprises			0
the two main candidates -- 59 - year - old @entity31 , son of a well connected tycoon , and 58 - year - old @entity34 , of more humble origins , but impeccable @entity37 credentials -- were supposed to conduct gentlemanly campaigns , culminating in @entity31 's eventual victory as the favorite of @entity10 's leaders and @entity0 's tycoons			1
but the mud started flying			0
@entity31 's private life became a public nightmare			2
first he was forced to own up to a string of marital infidelities			0
then a media circus descended on one of his homes , using cherry pickers and cranes to film over the high walls of the luxury property looking for evidence of illegal construction work			0
@entity31 's clumsy response , first denying , then blaming his wife for the work drew widespread condemnation			2
never a popular figure , @entity31 's opinion poll ratings tumbled and some of his backers began to question his electability			2
meanwhile @entity34 ran into his own troubles			2
he is currently under investigation for a conflict of interest case involving a construction project when he was in government office			0
there are also allegations of " black money " -- that his campaign had been in contact with organized crime figures			0
he also is reputed to be a closet communist , and to hold hardline views on public order and press freedom			0
even outgoing chief executive @entity82 has found himself embroiled in controversy amid allegations he had breached anti-bribery regulations by traveling on luxury yachts and private jets owned by wealthy friends			1
but despite his problems , @entity34 continues to show a consistent lead over @entity31 in public opinion polls			1
@entity21 is apparently now pressuring committee members to switch to @entity34			1
but it remains to be seen whether enough members of the election committee will listen			1
one of @entity97 's richest men , @entity98 , has said that he will continue to support @entity31			0
the pro-business @entity100 , controlling 28 votes , says it can not vote for @entity34 , while leaving it to individuals members whether they vote for @entity31 or not			1
@entity21 's hand has tipped the balance in favor of @entity34 , but he is not yet a shoe - in			2
the fact of the matter is that neither candidate is very popular and a number of members of the election committee are threatening to cast blank ballots			1
if no candidate can get more than 50 % of the votes the election will be annulled			0
it would need to be re-run in may , no doubt with some new faces			0
while this might be an acceptable outcome to many in @entity0 , it would be a huge loss of face for @entity21 , showing that it was unable to control the situation			2
this sunday there will be something unprecedented at a chief executive election in @entity0 -- suspense .			1

an election committee of 1,200 @entity0 people will choose new chief executive
@entity0 residents do not vote but the winning candidate is supposed to be " acceptable " to them
the two main candidates are 59 - year - old @entity31 and 58 - year - old @entity34
but both candidates have been mired in controversy , making the race *increasingly* *hostile*
