-- federal authorities are using words uttered by the co-founder of a radical @entity5 group to charge him with threats against the creators of " @entity8			1
" a criminal complaint alleging the communication of threats was filed in @entity11 late last week against @entity12 , also known as @entity13			1
a senior law enforcement source thursday told @entity0 , which interviewed @entity15 in 2009 , that the suspect is believed to be in @entity17 , where he maintains @entity18 , an english - language website propagating pro @entity21 views			1
that website is a successor to @entity12			1
@entity15 , a former resident of @entity24 , @entity25 , is the second person charged in the " @entity8 " case			1
in february , @entity27 , 21 , who admitted to posting online threats , was sentenced to 25 years in prison			1
@entity27 , a @entity12 convert , encouraged violent jihadists to attack " @entity8 " writers for an episode that depicted the @entity34 in a bear suit , court documents said			1
@entity27 posted online messages that included the writers ' home addresses and urged online readers to " pay them a visit , " the documents said			1
in an affidavit accompanying the recent complaint against @entity15 , @entity44 special agent @entity43 said @entity15 , co-founder of the group called @entity12 , worked with @entity27 on a " clarification statement " after @entity27 's postings			1
the pair made website postings that were -- despite their claims -- threats , @entity43 said			1
the agent also contends the statement contained pages of justification under @entity5 law for the death of those who insult @entity5 or defame its prophet			2
@entity12 's 2008 co-founders , @entity12 and @entity15 , were both interviewed by @entity0 's @entity64 in october 2009			2
in the interview @entity15 , a convert to @entity5 and one - time follower of the @entity65 , defended the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and argued that further attacks on @entity69 were justified			1
he told @entity64 he did not encourage violence on @entity69 soil			2
the government affidavit cites the @entity0 interview			2
" we 're commanded to terrorize the disbelievers , " @entity15 told @entity64			2
" the @entity77 says very clearly in the arabic language ... this means ' terrorize them			2
' it 's a command from @entity81			2
" @entity15 said he did not define terrorism as killing innocent civilians			2
" i define terrorism as making them fearful , so that they think twice before they go rape your mother or kill your brother or go into your land and try to steal your resources			0
" efforts by @entity0 thursday to reach @entity15 were unsuccessful			0
the senior law enforcement source told @entity0 's @entity96 if @entity15 crosses into @entity69 jurisdiction or into a country with extradition treaty with @entity69 , he will be arrested			0
@entity17 and the @entity69 do not have a bilateral extradition treaty , according to the @entity101			1
the source said the complaint was linked to the @entity27 case and that @entity15 's activities were a concern to @entity69 counterterrorism agencies			0
@entity12 was the subject of a @entity0 investigation for its radical rhetoric supporting " jihad " against the @entity111 and praising @entity21 leader @entity112			0
its organizers insisted they acted within the law and seek to protect @entity5			0
in april 2010 , @entity12 posted an entry that included a warning to " @entity8 " creators @entity119 and @entity120 that they risked violent retribution after the 200th episode of the cartoon series included a satirical discussion about whether an image of the prophet could be shown			1
in the end , he was portrayed disguised in a bear suit			0
" we have to warn @entity120 and @entity119 that what they are doing is stupid , " the posting on @entity12 says , " and they will probably wind up like @entity135 for airing this show			0
this is not a threat , but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them			0
" @entity143 filmmaker @entity135 was stabbed to death on a street in @entity146 , @entity143 , by an @entity5 extremist in 2004			0
he became the target of radical @entity5 after releasing a short film about oppression of @entity5 women in @entity152			0
@entity12 last spring said despite the provocative post , the site was calling simply for protest , not violence			0
@entity27 and @entity15 " purported to deny " that they were inciting violence , according to the @entity44 agent 's affidavit , but said " our position remains that it is likely the creators of ' @entity8 ' will indeed end up like @entity135			1
" in december 2010 , @entity12 co-founder @entity164 told @entity0 the defunct website became a " bug light for @entity12 misfits			1
" and he said he regretted that his message was taken by some as a justification to attack civilians			0
" it was an idiotic thing , looking back on things now , " @entity164 told @entity64			0
@entity15 in 2009 told @entity0 that " @entity69 will always be a target -- and a legitimate target -- until @entity69 changes its nature in the international arena			0
" @entity0 's @entity64 , @entity96 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
