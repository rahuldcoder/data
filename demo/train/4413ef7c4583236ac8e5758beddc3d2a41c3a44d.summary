@entity3 's former boyfriend @entity7 testified the day before that he had helped her break into the shed at her parents ' home on june 23 , 2008 -- one week after her little girl , @entity3 , was last seen			1
according to testimony , however , neither @entity2 's parents nor @entity7 knew that the child was missing , as @entity2 insisted that she was in the care of a nanny at the time			1

they got the gas cans , and @entity2 put the gas in her car herself , he testified			1
on june 24 , @entity2 called police to report the break - in and report the gas cans missing			1
he testified that he saw his daughter later in the day and argued with her about the missing cans , because he had a hunch she had them , as she had taken the cans before			2
@entity2 said that when he went to get them out of his daughter 's car , she bristled , brushed past him , quickly opened the trunk and retrieved the gas cans , throwing them down and telling him , " here 's your f --- ing gas cans			1
" the gas cans are significant to the case because a piece of duct tape on them appears to be the same as that found on the mouth of @entity3 's skeletal remains , which were found six months after the child went missing			1
the type of tape , prosecutor @entity50 told jurors in her opening statement this week , is relatively rare			0
" i 'm probably the one who put that on " the gas can , @entity2 said , adding that at the time , after @entity3 was reported missing , he and his wife were " running on fumes			1
... i 'm trying to do the best i can			0
" he said that when his daughter returned the gas cans to him , there was no tape on them			1
