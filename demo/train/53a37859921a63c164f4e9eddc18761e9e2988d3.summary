-- if you listen to the groupthink echo - chamber know - it - alls in @entity4 , the @entity1 has been decimated , destroyed , discombobulated and utterly distressed to the point of putting a " going out of business " sign out front and closing up shop for good			1
reality says that 's ridiculous			0
on the national level , the @entity1 controls the @entity13 @entity12 while @entity14 control the @entity15 and the @entity16			1
but the real power for the @entity1 is on the state level , and there they are dominating @entity14			1
@entity1 control the governor 's mansion in @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
folks , that 's 30 out of the 50 states in the nation			0
the @entity14 have governors in 19 states			2
( @entity59 's governor is an independent			0
) what about both chambers on the state level ? the @entity1 controls the legislature in @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity64 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity35 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
count ' em up and that 's 26			0
the @entity14 control 18 legislatures			2
five of the remaining six are split between the two chambers and one has a nonpartisan , one - chamber legislature			0
so much of the national media attention is always focused on what 's happening in @entity4 , but that is a common mistake that the political bosses keep making			0
every sunday show on broadcast and cable parades the usual suspects from the @entity15 and sometimes a few influential @entity13 @entity12 members , but it would make far more sense to be talking to governors , key state officials and mayors for a real understanding of what 's happening in @entity13			2
the @entity1 has been doing a lot of soul - searching and head - scratching since @entity93 was pummeled by president @entity94 in november			2
@entity1 leaders are being told that they must soften their stance on gay and lesbian issues , flip the script on immigration reform , stop dissing women at every turn , and become more " compassionate " -- like @entity103 when he was selling his candidacy in 2000			1
on monday , the @entity106 announced its 2012 election postmortem , which called for , among other things , an aggressive new push to reach minorities in the states			1
meanwhile , @entity14 are giddy , believing they have found a winning formula for the next generation by turning out young folks , gay and lesbian folks , black voters , @entity118 voters and lots of women			2
sure , that coalition worked well for @entity94 , but there is no guarantee it will be the key to success for the next @entity14 presidential candidate			0
so while @entity14 salivate at the prospect of winning the @entity128 in 2016 , republicans continue to lay the groundwork for taking over the state houses and gubernatorial mansions , and building a formidable team of next - generation politicians to dominate there and in the @entity128			0
in fact , many @entity1 have told me they could n't care less about @entity4 , because legislation with real impact is being proposed and passed in the states			1
that 's why you 've seen groups quietly backing initiatives on the state level and bypassing the hot lights and screaming media in @entity4			1
the real battles on same - sex marriage , abortion , education , spending , labor unions , and , yes , the @entity147 are happening state by state			0
and @entity14 are being caught flat - footed because they ignored the admonition of former @entity158 chairman @entity157 to create a 50 - state party , and instead , created a party that cared more about @entity161 and the @entity128			0
think about it : @entity94 won @entity42 , @entity26 , @entity34 , @entity44 , @entity39 and @entity37 , all states with @entity1 governors			1
so clearly voters in those states chose the @entity1 alternative in statewide elections , but when it came to the presidency , said " no thanks			1
" i 'm not buying for a second this silly notion that the @entity1 will have a @entity175 experience and drastically change			2
it 's not going to happen			0
there will be some movement on the national level , but @entity1 grass - roots organizers are very well aware that the message the @entity1 is selling statewide is a winning formula			1
trust me , @entity1 are concocting other pieces of legislation to bring change on the state level , regardless of what 's happening in @entity4			1
the political adage " all politics is local " has not changed			0
maybe more of my brothers and sisters in @entity4 need to get outside the @entity193 , hit the road and discover the far more expansive @entity13 that is happening outside @entity4 , @entity195 , @entity50 , @entity196 and @entity38			0
if they do , they 'll find out that the conventional wisdom is pretty much worthless .			0

@entity201 : political echo chamber says @entity1 *doomed* by its losses in 2012 election
do n't believe it , he says -- @entity1 has power where it counts : governors , state legislatures
he says dems claim minorities , women , but @entity1 plans *big* push for those voters
@entity201 : @entity1 pushing *inroads* at state level , not seriously changing policy ; dems , wise up
