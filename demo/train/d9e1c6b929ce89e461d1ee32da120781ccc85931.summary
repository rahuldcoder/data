-- the much - discussed @entity2 tablet may finally come to fruition as soon as next week			1
it 's been talked about for months , but @entity4 has yet to acknowledge that such a device exists			1
but today @entity6 reported that the @entity8 smartphone maker may reveal its own @entity10 - like tablet at its developer conference in @entity12 , which starts monday			2
the @entity6 's unnamed sources say the device is not ready for shipping to customers , but will by sometime during the fourth quarter of this year			0
the @entity2 tablet -- sometimes referred to as the " @entity18 " since @entity4 bought the domain blackpad.com -- is said to have a 7 - inch touchscreen and at least one camera , maybe two , according to the @entity6			1
previous reports have said the @entity18 would have a screen closer to the size of the 9.7 - inch @entity10			1
in line with previous reports , the tablet will not have its own cellular service but will be a companion device to a @entity2 smartphone , the newspaper reported			2
that means the tablet will have @entity34 access but will need to be tethered to a @entity2 for a @entity36 connection			0
perhaps most interesting is what @entity4 apparently has planned on the software front			2
it 's been reported before , but the @entity6 's story reiterates that the tablet wo n't use @entity4 's new @entity2 mobile os. instead it will use a new os from @entity43 , a company @entity4 purchased earlier this year			1
the report says the @entity43 software could eventually replace the software on all @entity4 smartphones			1
how much the device will cost is still unknown			0
since it 's not being sold with wireless service , it seems unlikely it would be sold through a carrier the way @entity55 are , and that would mean no carrier subsidy like newer tablets from @entity59 and @entity60 have			0
