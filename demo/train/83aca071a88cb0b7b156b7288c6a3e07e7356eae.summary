@entity0 -- what did you do over your summer vacation ? if you 're president @entity5 , you 've had a bit of a transformation			1
that is , from the mild - mannered @entity9 into , well , @entity10			2
when we last left this story , president @entity5 was trying to be the measured adult in the room , compromising over the debt ceiling to get a deal			1
in the end , it was n't the " grand bargain " that @entity5 wanted			1
liberals argued that it was awful , too -- chastising the president for negotiating with himself			1
and @entity25 complained that they needed more spending cuts			1
and , oh , by the way , they still wanted to repeal health care reform			2
in other words , an unsatisfactory experience for all			2
so when @entity5 came back to @entity0 this fall , the feeling inside the @entity33 was that something had to change			1
the bad news : mr. @entity36 ( aka mr. compromise ) had sunk to new lows in the ratings			2
the good news : @entity41 had sunk even lower			0
then @entity33 speaker @entity43 gave a speech outlining his demands for the deficit reduction " supercommittee			0
" top of the list : no new taxes			2
the @entity33 figured it had no partner for peace			0
the man who had almost signed on to the grand bargain -- with some tax increases and entitlement cuts -- was n't about to come back to the table anytime soon			2
the next step : play the game			0
the president outlined his demand for the debt reduction supercommittee : no spending cuts for the middle class without commensurate tax increases on the wealthy			1
no proposals for long - term entitlement reform			0
but there was a catchy bumper sticker : the @entity72			0
billionaires should not pay a lower tax rate than the rest of us			0
it 's not intellectually satisfying			0
nor does it improve the chances for a deal out of the supercommittee that can get anywhere in @entity41			1
it 's politics , plain and simple			0
in fact , the strategy does one big thing : it reunites the president with the base of the @entity90 , which finally had something to cheer			1
when @entity5 came out swinging this week , threatening to veto any deficit reduction measure without a balance of new taxes and spending cuts , there was joy among liberals			1
@entity5 had finally come home			1
for the rest of us , well , it was a dismal peek at reality			0
who can really fault the @entity33 for playing politics with @entity25 who have refused to cut the big deals ? after all , the @entity25 presidential candidates , by and large , are still complaining that @entity41 agreed to raise the debt ceiling			1
after @entity43 lay down his laws , @entity5 had to do the same			1
he could no longer negotiate with himself			0
so he joined the game			0
maybe it 's the opening salvo , and maybe something will come of this kabuki			0
but there is a final calculation here : if nothing comes out of the supercommittee , the president would be less damaged than the @entity41			2
as for the rest of us , we 're still waiting for @entity10			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity124 .			1

@entity124 : president @entity5 is taking tougher stands
she says @entity25 signaled *inflexibility* on taxes
in return , @entity5 is demanding *revenue* increases , she says
@entity124 : @entity5 gaining credit from base , but chances of a deal are slim
