many of these pre-incan " huacas , " or sacred places , are now at risk because of a lack of funding and protection , according to @entity14			0
" most huacas are officially the cultural patrimony of the nation , but the area around them that can not be touched is not delineated , " archaeologist @entity15 told @entity14			0
" this omission allows developers and squatters to invade them , or mayors to build parks and playing fields on them			0
