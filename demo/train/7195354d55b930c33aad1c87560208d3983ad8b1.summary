-- it was a five cent @entity2 yuan coin that gave @entity3 the chance to dance			1
@entity5 , character and determination led to @entity3 becoming @entity9 's first @entity2 principal dancer			1
born into a traditional family in @entity12 , the obstacles @entity3 broke through to become one of today 's most critically acclaimed ballerinas began at home			1
her mother who had wanted to be a ballerina saw that her daughter 's physique , looks and determination fitted perfectly into a ballerina 's profile and encouraged @entity3 to become one			1
" she wanted me to fulfill her dream , " @entity3 told @entity0 's @entity25			1
but her father , an engineer , had a different plan for his daughter			0
" he wanted me to become a doctor or an engineer ... because i was a good student in school , " @entity3 said			1
her father saw ballet as a western art form inappropriate for a traditional @entity2 girl and as a career that is unstable and short			1
the two settled their differences with a flip of a coin that landed in favor of her mother 's wishes and her father accepted the defeat as a matter of fate			1
the relationship between ballet and @entity3 began at the age of five when @entity3 was mesmerized by the beauty of a performance of @entity54 on tv			2
apart from the tutus and the fairy queen 's crown , the music and the ballerina 's movements impressed her			2
at age 11 , @entity3 began her rigorous training at @entity63 and graduated four years later			2
but entering @entity63 a year later than the other pupils made it difficult for @entity3 to catch up			2
" i was n't very good			0
i was always in the corner crying , " said @entity3			0
things took a turn for the better in her third year when ms. @entity70 , a new teacher took over the class and " put her full time into our ballet trainings , " @entity3 added			0
when @entity0 asked about her motivation to be an incredible performer , she explained : " it is in @entity2 blood to always try your best ... and no matter what happens today , for example , if your back gives out or your foot is in pain or your toe is bleeding , no matter what happens you always give the audience a perfect show			0
" @entity9 artistic director , @entity88 , saw this desire and determination in @entity3 at an international ballet competition in @entity92 and immediately stole her from @entity93 in @entity94 that had offered her a scholarship			2
joining the company in 1995 , two years later she became the first @entity2 principal dancer in @entity99 's 70 year history			1
along the way to becoming one of the world 's best ballerinas , she has won three international dancing awards , danced at the @entity105 for former president @entity106 , and was named one of @entity109 's " @entity108 " in 2004			0
but despite the accolades , @entity3 remains down to earth , even sewing her own point shoes with elastics and ribbons to attain the perfect shape for her feet			0
" the shoes are just part of my life ... it usually takes me more than half an hour to sew , " she said			0
she has recently accepted @entity122 's offer to be a guest principal dancer in " @entity124 " , three 20th century masterpieces which include @entity127 's rubies , @entity129 's " @entity128 " , and @entity131 's " @entity130 "			1
in the future , @entity3 hopes to be a ballet educator , choreographer or designer in both @entity2 and the @entity136			2
but in the meantime she has decided to follow her @entity139 teachings and just " go with the flow			0
" " if a good opportunity comes to me i will embrace it			0
i am very grateful that i have this opportunity ; if it 's not mine , it 's not mine , " she told @entity0 .			0

@entity3 is @entity9 's principal dancer
career path as a ballerina was decided by the flip of a coin
growing up in traditional @entity2 family , her father wanted her to be a doctor
