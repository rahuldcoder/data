-- we have no comprehension of what is going through the minds of 200 @entity6 girls abducted from their school on april 14			1
we can not know their darkest fears or the pain and anguish they have had to endure from the @entity13 terrorists who took them			0
we can not imagine for a second what their families are feeling			0
but there is one thing we do understand : a rage is gathering worldwide at extremist groups that deny young girls their right to education			1
and we must take action			0
wednesday , july 23 , marks a tragic milestone			0
it is the girls ' 100th day in captivity			2
for an adolescent with plans , dreams and ambitions , 100 days must seem an eternity			1
but they are not alone			0
the world has not forgotten these girls			2
on wednesday , vigils will be staged in @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and the @entity43			2
candlelit demonstrations will be held in @entity39 countries from @entity46 and @entity47 to @entity48 , organized by the @entity49 , which fears the girls might be trafficked into slavery			2
schoolgirls will take to the streets in @entity54 , led by @entity55 of @entity58 - e - @entity57 - o - @entity56 , or @entity59 , the girls ' rights group campaigning for what the @entity63 girls have lost -- their right to an education			1
in @entity68 , vigils will be led by @entity69 and the @entity71 group , which rescues children from bonded labor every day , and has common cause with girls who have been taken from their homes			1
opinion : 100 days on , @entity6 haunted by girls ' kidnapping @entity80 , the anti-slavery organization led by @entity82 billionaire @entity81 , who has exposed the extent of child slavery in the modern world , is throwing its weight behind the campaign			1
and across the globe , a world at @entity90 's 500 @entity89 led by the @entity92 envoy will be marking the events , handing in petitions to embassies and consulates in the world 's biggest capitals			2
an online petition by @entity88 calls for the safe return of the girls and all messages of support will be passed to families of the girls and @entity63 community leaders			0
the petition supporting the president of @entity6 in all his military and diplomatic efforts to bring back the girls will also be sent to @entity6 president @entity112 and @entity114 secretary general @entity113			1
coinciding with the july 23 vigil is the deployment , by the @entity6 government , to the @entity119 area , of helicopters and aircraft with enhanced surveillance capacity and night vision equipment , capable of identifying the captured girls			1
around the globe there is an understanding that @entity6 is simply the latest country after the @entity43 with 9/11 in 2001 and @entity128 with its 7/7 in 2005 to be hit by terrorist outrages -- and that in its hour of need , @entity6 deserves the support of the world community against a terrorist sect that thinks nothing of killing and raping schoolgirls and seeks to deny them the basic right to education			1
the petition is not just for the rescue of the girls but for the rebuilding of their @entity63 school and the creation of safer schools throughout @entity6 , particularly in those areas where girls are not going to school for fear of terrorism			1
the @entity153 , a fund set up to pilot 500 safe schools in northern @entity6 , brings the @entity6 government and @entity6 business leaders together with the international community to ensure that all children are secure when learning			2
the fund total stands at $ 23 million			0
young people are demonstrating because they see the connection between abductions in @entity6 , the rapes and murders of young girls in @entity68 , so - called " honor killings " of @entity54 girls who marry against family wishes , genital mutilation of girls in preparation for child marriages across @entity39 and the ever - present reality that 7 million school age girls are working full time , often in slave labor conditions , many of them trafficked out of their home country when they should be at school			1
there is a common denominator : seventy years on , the @entity182 has failed to take girls ' rights seriously			0
so , girls are taking action to make themselves heard			0
incensed by the realization that it could take 100 years for them to have the same right to basic education -- as guaranteed in the declaration -- as boys , girls will lead their liberation struggle			1
and the new divide across the world will no longer be between the educated and the uneducated but the educated and those demanding to be educated			0
slowly but surely , local embryonic civil rights movements are linking up with global leaders : girls not brides , @entity80 and a @entity201 are now umbrella organizations , pioneering the creation of hundreds of youth ambassadors and part of the emergency coalition to achieve zero child labor , zero child marriage , zero education exclusion and zero discrimination against girls at schools			1
the @entity213 for @entity214 , to get 57 million children in school , will be launched in september during @entity217 week			0
the coalition will call on the international community to take action			0
the message every day is loud and it is clear			0
girls should be able to study in a classroom , free of fear , and without the need , as they will do on wednesday , to demonstrate on the streets .			0

vigils around the world for @entity6 girls , who have been held captive 100 days
rage has built against extremist groups that deny girls their right to education
girls are forming grass - roots groups to *protest* child marriage , *promote* education
coalition aims for zero child labor , zero child marriage , zero education exclusion
