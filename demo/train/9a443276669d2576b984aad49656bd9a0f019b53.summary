-- living amid the garbage - strewn sewage canals , residents of @entity3 's @entity2 endure a grim battle for survival every single day			1
the shantytown in the northern reaches of capital @entity9 is one of the countries poorest areas , blighted by poor sanitation and violence			1
shacks , on average , house nine people and around half the population earn less than $ 0.50 a day			0
it 's little wonder then that life expectancy is n't much more than 50 years , according to the healthcare @entity22 , @entity24			0
but one man is hoping to challenge this statistic , planting the seeds of a healthier future for the district 's 250,000 population by transforming a garbage dump into a vibrant urban garden			1
" growing up in @entity2 we have the situation where people think it 's somewhere nothing good can happen , " says local resident @entity33			0
" but myself and some members of the community wanted to have something to turn it green and nothing could be better than a garden			1
" the results are extraordinary			0
@entity45 ( @entity46 ) covers half - an - acre and is the largest urban garden in the country			1
teeming with plants and people planting and picking them , the garden is hugely popular with locals			1
" we grow about 20 different vegetables in the garden , " explains @entity33			1
founded in 2011 , the garden has an abundance of vegetables and herbs : eggplants , peppers , chard , radishes , potatoes , parsley , basil			2
it 's a cornucopia of healthy green vegetables that rivals any community farm in the world			2
" people get in mind that it 's not possible to garden in @entity3 -- the soil is no longer good , we do n't have water			1
but you see we have accomplished something really amazing , " says @entity33			0
the bulk of the produce is used for the local soup kitchen providing much needed nutrition for the community			2
whatever is left is sold at market			0
it 's not just the plants which catch your eye , but also the recycled pots and containers			1
old tires , shoes , footballs are filled and planted			1
even toilet bowls and old suitcases have been put to use			2
" we use whatever we can find			0
the whole point is first we want the kids to feel connected with what seems like nothing much , because this is something that would just float in the canal			0
we say : ' no ! it could grow parsley , ' " @entity33 says			0
" i want them to be able to eat , to make money out of the garden and to feel more peace through the garden			2
if i can see these three things happen , i would feel as if i had fulfilled my dream			0

community garden project a *symbol* of hope for @entity3 shantytown
