a huge hole has opened up in the earth			0
thousands of people will soon be packing their belongings and moving on			0
in some cases , whole buildings will be dismantled brick by brick and carted off to a safer location			1
this dramatic scene may sound like one of the more brutal passages of the @entity13 , but the @entity14 this is not			0
instead , it 's the strange reality unfolding in the @entity17 town of @entity18 , northern @entity19			1
a nearby iron ore mine -- @entity18 's main source of income and employment for more than a century -- has begun to encroach on the city in recent years			1
small cracks have also begun to show on the streets in business and residential areas			1
a detailed analysis by @entity30 ( the state - owned company that operates the mine ) has predicted that the these fractures will only get worse as it attempts to access the most difficult to reach minerals			2
according to @entity34 of @entity30 , the remaining iron ore bodies are located directly under the city			2
this creates a problem as the law , and the company 's own policy , prohibits mining under populated areas			2
" when the mines initially opened , it made sense to build housing near the workplaces , @entity34 said			0
" however , no one could have imagined that over 120 years later we would be mining ore a kilometre below ground and that this would have a significant impact on the communities in which we operate			2
" the people of @entity18 have been aware of these developments since 2004 when @entity30 sent local residents a letter detailing the severity of the situation			1
in the period since , they have been forced to wrestle with an unenviable dilemma			0
either the mine , which employs around 4,000 local people , closes down and the city loses its primary source of income , or it continues to operate and a large part of @entity18 is sectioned off and its inhabitants are forced to move a new location			1
the problem is succinctly surmised by @entity73 , head of development at the @entity75			0
" the city is the mine and the mine is the city , " @entity73 said			2
" we have lived together for 100 years and we have a huge dependence on each other			0
without the mine the town would die			2
" after much debate and an international competition to flesh out what the new @entity18 would look like , the option to move won the day			1
over the course of the next 20 years , a new town center , municipal buildings and 3,000 homes will be constructed two miles away			1
when the project is finished , roughly 6,000 of @entity18 's 23,000 residents will have been relocated , according to data provided by @entity30			1
people forced to depart over this period will have their property purchased from them by the mining firm			2
they will then choose between investing in one of the newly built homes or , if they prefer , upping sticks for pastures new			0
on top of this , around 20 structures of cultural and architectural significance will be taken down brick by brick and rebuilt in a new , more stable location			1
understandably , such an ambitious task has drawn attention from around the globe			0
" the idea of having a city and then moving it has never happened before , " cars said			2
" among the buildings being moved is the local church , which was voted the most beautiful building in @entity19 2001			1
the bell tower from the existing town hall will also be removed and placed in the new town square			2
the incremental nature of the move has led to @entity18 being dubbed the " millipede town			1
" building work began last march and has been progressing at a gentle pace ever since			0
as things stand , the foundations have been laid for the new @entity130 while one business ( a shop ) has been shuttered in the old town , according to @entity34			2
other buildings slated for construction include a new train station , town square , hotels , offices and schools			1
" i think that we can make a lot of improvements ... ( with ) more modern houses and buildings , " @entity34 said			2
for architecture firm @entity148 , however , the opportunity to reimagine a 100 - year - old town goes way beyond the possibility of erecting some eye - catching new buildings			1
co-lead architect , @entity151 , envisions a sleek , modern development that embodies the most cutting - edge concepts of design and urban - planning			2
he describes a town that embellishes the spectacular nature of the surrounding region and a new people - friendly town - center built entirely from scratch			1
there will be more social meeting places , more cafes and more scope for cultural activities than are currently available in the existing @entity18 , @entity151 adds			1
for the residents of @entity18 , such changes are generally perceived positively , @entity167 explained			1
the current city has no town center and very few areas for gathering or for putting on events			1
it also has a long - held demographic problem of retaining female residents , many of whom prefer to move elsewhere for work			0
these are all problems the new design for the new @entity18 seeks to solve			1
yet there remain concerns about the psychological and emotional impacts moving a city will have on its residents			0
some older people even worry whether they will be able to afford home in the new @entity18 , although the local authorities are adamant that a solution will be found if anyone finds themselves in such a situation			1
the unique community feeling is something the architects hope to maintain			0
according to @entity199 , this project is as much " a question of identity and what will make people feel like they are at home			0
" social anthropologist , @entity205 , has been drafted in by @entity148 to help deal with these issues			0
she describes the importance of not completely banishing existing landmarks no matter how insignificant they are			0
people can hold strong sentimental memories over items as seemingly meaningless as a street name or a park bench , believes @entity205			0
a smartly named " @entity219 " has been set up that will allow people to identify items that they would like to see moved to the new town			1
this could be something as small as a particular brick that holds a special memory or as big as the existing bell tower			0
the @entity227 , meanwhile , an event scheduled to begin in the city in years to come , will be a nostalgic celebration about what the city was but also what it will become			0
while far from perfect , @entity205 believes these projects will help ease people 's feelings about the transition			0
it will also serve to emphasize how unique the residents of @entity18 and their city really are			1
" there 's this mutual relationship ( between the people and the mine ) which is quite interesting that i do n't see in other projects when you move cities , " @entity205 said			0
" when slums are cleared its obvious who has the power			0
i mean , the decision is made and people are moved			0
" but in @entity18 , there is this mutual ( requirement ) between the town and the mine			1
so , it has to be done in this respectful way			0

cracks have appeared in the streets of the @entity17 city of @entity18 *due* to mining activity nearby
a large part of the town will be moved to allow *economically* important mining to continue
some buildings will be taken down brick - by - brick and rebuilt at a new location
