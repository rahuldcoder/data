-- the challenges involved in bringing " @entity6 " to the screen -- the ever changing script , the production delays , the budget that reportedly soared past $ 215 million -- are not exactly a secret			1
if the thing had been a cakewalk , odds are we would n't be sitting here 10 full years after the last installment of the sci - fi - comedy series , gearing up for the new film 's may 25 release			2
but co-star @entity16 had his own personal slice of misery to contend with in the making of " @entity6 " : honing his impression of @entity21			1
the film 's storyline has @entity25 's @entity24 traveling back in time to 1969 to prevent an alien baddie named @entity27 ( played by @entity28 ) from assassinating @entity29 -- and the critical job of playing that younger incarnation of @entity32 fell to @entity16			1
" that was the toughest thing i 'll ever do , " @entity16 tells @entity0			1
" i 'm literally reliving it with you right now , and i 'm so happy to be able to laugh about it			0
" @entity16 had worked with @entity21 twice before -- in the 2007 films in the @entity38 and " @entity39 " -- and gotten a chance to study the actor 's very specific and sometimes , shall we say , prickly vibe up close			1
" the ambiance that @entity45 creates on a set is just unparalleled , " @entity16 says , laughing			1
" the tension is f * * * ing amazing			0
i just found it fascinating			0
i grew up with a lot of cowboys , so it does n't affect me as deeply as it would the urban norm			0
i just laugh at it			0
but it 's still uncomfortable			0
that 's his genius : ' how can i make this the most uncomfortable moment anybody has ever had in the world ? ' there 's no way he 's thinking it -- it 's just intrinsic			0
" from observing @entity21 , @entity16 had developed a decent impression of the actor 's deadpan , laconic , staccato way of speaking that , by chance , he shared with " @entity6 " director @entity71 one night at a dinner with the @entity73 during the " @entity75 " shoot			1
it was good enough to convince @entity71 that @entity16 was the only choice to play the young agent @entity78 still , @entity16 was n't initially convinced he quite fit the part : " it 's like , ' why me ? ' i do n't know if it 's the @entity84 people see in me and @entity45			1
or if it 's the size of our skulls			0
or if there 's a @entity90 feeling when you look at us -- sort of a silverback thing			2
" whatever their resemblance , the prospect of going from a casual impression of @entity21 to a full - fledged performance as young @entity32 was terrifying , @entity16 says			1
" i did lots and lots of practicing [ in the months leading up to production ] , " he says			0
" i was just sitting there with @entity102 [ recording myself ] going , ' hey , how ya doin ' ? hey , how ya doin ' ? ' --- over and over , for days and months , thinking , ' i 'm going to sound like an idiot in this film			0
' i was down in @entity106 at one point with a buddy of mine and i was so frustrated , i got so drunk -- the stress level was just so high			0
i never felt like i had it , and i still do n't			0
" by all accounts ( and judging from the movie 's trailer ) , @entity16 nailed the performance , much as he did with his well - received turn as @entity117 in @entity119 's " w. " " you do n't want it to be showboat - y , " @entity16 says			1
" the hope is after five minutes everyone will forget they 're watching me doing @entity45 playing @entity32 and just kind of lend themselves to the story			1
" but what was @entity21 ' own take on @entity16 's performance ? @entity16 is n't quite sure			1
" i did n't ever do @entity45 in front of @entity45 , " he says			2
" i know @entity45 just saw the movie -- and his only comment was that he really liked [ actor @entity135 's character ] @entity136			2
