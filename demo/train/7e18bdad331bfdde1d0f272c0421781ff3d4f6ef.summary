-- a week after students seized @entity5 's legislative building over a controversial trade deal with @entity9 , @entity5 's president @entity4 agreed to meet with protest leaders to help end the standoff and allow the legislature to get back on track , a spokesperson for the president 's office said			1
@entity4 is willing to invite representatives of the movement to his office " without any preconditions , " @entity14 , a spokesperson for the president 's office said tuesday in a statement			2
hundreds of protesters , many of them university students , have been camped out in the @entity24 's main assembly hall since march 18 , over a service trade pact that they say could harm @entity5 's economy and allow @entity9 to exert greater influence over the island			1
thousands more have gathered outside the building , according to organizers			0
at a press conference on tuesday night , student leader @entity31 responded to the president 's invitation , saying the protesters agreed that no preconditions should be set for the meeting			1
but , he added , the students wanted to discuss whether @entity5 needed new legislation to monitor all cross-strait agreements , and whether the service trade pact with @entity9 should be delayed until that legislation is introduced			1
on wednesday , @entity31 said the students were rejecting the president 's invitation for now as it failed to include a fixed date or time for the talks , or concrete content for discussion			1
he told @entity0 that the protesters inside the @entity24 had no plans to leave			0
" we are willing to talk , but we really hope to see the president express sincerity , " @entity31 said in a statement on his @entity53 page			0
the president 's office confirmed to @entity0 that the students had not yet accepted the invitation			2
@entity5 signed the service trade pact with @entity9 , its biggest trade partner in june last year , but it is yet to be ratified			1
the agreement will open up 80 of @entity9 's service sectors to @entity5 and 64 of @entity5 's service sectors to @entity9 , including tourism , transport , construction and telecommunications			1
a review of the deal was delayed in @entity5 's legislature until march 17 , when @entity5 's ruling party @entity73 pushed the pact forward without bipartisan deliberation			1
the main opposition said that this move broke an agreement that all legislators would consider the deal one clause at a time			0
protesters , who claimed negotiations over the deal were opaque and undemocratic , broke into the legislative building in @entity87 the next day , demanding that the pact be scrapped			1
the demonstration has been mostly peaceful , but tensions boiled over late sunday , when a group of protesters stormed the nearby executive building			0
more than 100 people were injured when riot police armed with wooden batons and shields evicted the protesters and dispersed the crowd using water cannon			0
hours before the scuffle , @entity5 's president defended the deal in his first public address to the protests			1
calling on the protesters to adhere to the rule of law , @entity4 said the pact would create jobs for young people and that without regional economic integration , @entity5 would be left behind			1
student leader @entity31 , speaking to @entity0 by phone from inside the legislature building monday , criticized the pact			0
he claimed the deal would allow @entity9 to invest in " sensitive and core industries " including those associated with press freedom , such as publishing and advertising			0
@entity5 split from mainland @entity9 in 1949 following the @entity118 , but @entity119 still considers it a breakaway province , and has warned that any formal declaration of independence could lead to military intervention			2
however , cross-strait ties have improved since @entity4 took office in 2008 , and recent high - level talks between the two sides have been hailed as a sign of thawing relations			0
on monday , a spokesperson for the @entity132 , @entity130 told reporters that the @entity134 has welcomed steps by @entity5 and @entity9 to reduce tensions and improve relations , and hopes that talks over the trade deal can be conducted " peacefully and civilly			2
" " we certainly support @entity5 's vibrant democracy , which allows for this kind of robust political dialogue , " @entity130 said			2
the protests have garnered widespread support among @entity5 living abroad			0
rallies are being held in at least 10 countries , including @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , the @entity154 and the @entity134			0
@entity0 's @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 contributed to this report .			0
