-- @entity1 , @entity2 's former finance minister , recently said his country is enjoying " its best period in 300 years			1
" @entity0 looks at how the country emerged from communism to become one of eastern @entity9 's most stable and thriving democracies			0
solidarity leader @entity10 addresses striking workers in @entity12 , @entity2 in 1989			1
@entity13 gained independence in 1918 only to be overrun by @entity15 and the @entity16 during the @entity17			1
almost six million @entity2 , including the majority of the country 's large @entity20 population , died during the devastating six - year conflict			1
the shadow of @entity24 continued to loom large over @entity2 after the war , when the communist - dominated government ensured that @entity2 would become a @entity16 satellite state for the next 40 years			1
the following decades were punctuated by revolts against the repressive authoritarian regime in @entity32 , but none had a greater impact on @entity2 's political future than events in 1980 at a shipyard in western @entity2			1
with a struggling economy and rumors of corruption and mismanagement within the state causing widespread discontent , a series of strikes by workers paralyzed the country			0
eventually the government was forced to negotiate and on august 31 , 1980 , workers at the massive @entity50 in @entity12 , led by an electrician named @entity10 , signed a deal giving workers the right to strike and form trade unions			0
this heralded the creation of the @entity58 , which would ultimately be instrumental in bringing @entity2 's communist era to an end			2
the presence in the @entity62 at the time of @entity2 - born @entity64 was also a significant influence on the movement throughout the 1980s , as the @entity67 had remained a very potent force in @entity2 life			1
the @entity64 even made a visit to the country in 1979			0
despite @entity16 - endorsed attempts to slow the erosion of the regime 's grip on power -- including the declaration of martial law by general @entity79 in 1981 which outlawed @entity58 -- @entity2 's worsening economic situation , compounded by further nationwide strikes , meant that the government had no alternative but to negotiate a date for free elections with @entity10 and the solidarity movement			1
solidarity members won a stunning victory in the election of 1989 , taking almost all the seats in the @entity91 and all of the 169 seats they were allowed to contest in the @entity94 or parliament			0
this gave them substantial influence in the new government			0
activist and journalist @entity100 was appointed prime minister , while @entity10 was elected as president the following year			0
after years of economic mismanagement under the communists , @entity2 embarked on a painful reform program under finance minister @entity1 -- especially in traditional heavy industries such as coal and steel -- which moved away from the inefficient state - controlled system of economic planning			1
despite growing unemployment and a dilapidated infrastructure , @entity2 was slowly transformed into an investment - friendly , market economy			1
banking and lending policies were reformed , while newly reshaped ownership relations , independent enterprises and strengthened domestic competition all had a massive impact			0
over a relatively short period of time , @entity2 had become one of the most dynamically developing economies in @entity9 and by the mid- 1990s , it became known as the " @entity126			2
" @entity2 also liberalized its international trade during this period			0
the national currency -- the zloty -- became convertible to other currencies and internal convertibility was also established , providing another platform for dynamic economic growth			0
new markets in countries that had been treated not so long before as ideological as well as economic enemies were opened up to @entity2 companies			2
the @entity139 and @entity140 were now the key markets for @entity2 goods			1
this realignment of policy was emphasized by its accession into the @entity139 in 2004			2
it had also joined @entity147 in 1999			0
unfortunately the continuing problem of high unemployment and the promise of better salaries encouraged many @entity2 to work in other @entity139 countries after 2004			1
however this trend started to reverse in 2008 as the @entity2 economy enjoyed a boom period			2
politically , @entity2 has also successfully transformed itself into a fully democratic country			0
since 1991 the @entity2 people have voted in parliamentary elections and four presidential elections -- all free and fair			2
incumbent governments have transferred power smoothly and constitutionally in every instance to their successors .			0

@entity2 was ruled by @entity16 - backed regime after the @entity17
solidarity movement became a key factor in the fall of communist regime
centrally - planned economic system *replaced* by free market economy
@entity2 joined the @entity139 in 2004
