-- how many young people have gotten in trouble for something they 've posted on @entity4 ? maybe a party picture or an offensive comment compromised their chances at a job			1
but a 25 - year - old @entity9 says his @entity4 activity has led to his father 's detention in a notorious prison in @entity15			1
and now he 's struggling to find a way to free him			0
" i want my family to forgive me , " @entity19 said			2
" but i believe what i believe in			0
" a year ago , while studying at a college in @entity23 , @entity19 joined a @entity4 page that made fun of a top @entity27 imam , @entity26			1
@entity28 is one of 12 imams considered successors to the @entity31			0
called " @entity32 , " the imams are protected by law in @entity9 from ridicule or even frivolous comments			2
one can be arrested for insulting them			2
the @entity4 page , dubbed the " campaign to remind @entity27 about @entity28 , " features a robed man , presumably @entity28 , with a face like @entity42 's , flanked by a camel wearing sunglasses and the donkey from " @entity46			1
" it also shows a picture of a @entity27 tomb that has been pooped on by a flock of pigeons			0
with more than 21,000 likes , the page explains , " our goal is to use satire to take out the superstition from religion			0
" " we believe that everything and everybody could be the subject of a joke , " @entity19 said			2
" nothing and nobody is too holy to be funny			0
at the beginning it was not that serious because it was a joke			0
" @entity68 tests internet freedom theory @entity19 did n't know who the manager of the site was			1
they both used nicknames , as did many people who posted , @entity19 said			2
in the early days , though , @entity19 posted links to his personal @entity4 page , which had his real name			1
" i feel like that is how the authorities knew to come after me , " @entity19 said			2
during that time , @entity19 said , he was n't thinking too much about someone in the @entity9 government seeing the page			1
it seemed unlikely : one page out of so many on @entity4			1
the thought did cross his mind a couple times that if it did become popular , it would probably upset some people back in @entity9 , where his father , mother and sister lived			1
but he kept posting on the page out of principle , he said			0
" from the beginning , i knew that it could be dangerous , but the thing is this : taboos should be broken , " he said			0
" i knew that it could be sensitive ( for ) @entity99 and @entity9 worldwide , but here in @entity102 , jokes are made -- jokes of @entity105 stories or @entity106 -- and nobody is threatened or killed			2
this is how it should be			0
" a page 's overnight fame @entity19 took comfort , he said , that the page had a small number of followers			1
@entity117 skyrocketed in mid-may , when an @entity9 rapper living in @entity119 made international headlines , @entity19 said			1
@entity9 's religious authority had placed a fatwa on the rapper 's head for making a song that mocked the same imam			1
the song had gone viral			0
all of a sudden , people around the world were googling the rapper and the imam			0
" that was a boon for the ( page ) , " @entity19 said			1
" on may 23 , @entity19 got a call from his father , @entity136 , in @entity9			1
" he said , ' some people from the intelligence service had come ( to our house ) , and they want you to cooperate , ' " @entity19 recalled			2
" my father said , ' they want your passwords to your @entity4 , web blog and e-mail			1
' " the young man was frightened and felt trapped			0
first , he did n't manage the page and therefore could n't take it down			1
he assumed that the @entity9 authorities just did n't understand that			1
" they came after me maybe because from the beginning , i was very active on the page , and you could tell that i had a close relationship -- commenting back and forth -- with the manager , " he said			0
he fired off a @entity4 message to the manager of the site , explaining the situation and asking that the page be taken down			1
the manager wrote back , refusing to deactivate the page			0
it 's unclear exactly why the manager chose to keep the site up			0
but @entity19 thinks there are two reasons , both of them legitimate			2
allowing @entity9 to succeed in taking the page down would be to defeat the very reason it was created : to challenge authority and create a greater sense of free expression			1
and it 's possible that the manager suspected that @entity19 's e-mail was a fake and that the sender was actually someone with the @entity9 authority trying to trick the manager into taking the page down , @entity19 said			1
" at first , i was angry , but i was also emotional " at the news that the page would stay up , @entity19 said			1
but " i understand that taking the page down , really , was n't going to help my father			1
" can @entity4 page help @entity187 , @entity9 toward peace ? password protection @entity19 considered whether he should give up the passwords to the accounts he did control : his personal @entity4 account and his e-mail			1
but he decided that would n't be wise			0
the @entity9 could go through those accounts and find the names of his friends and other information , he feared			2
@entity19 seemed to be in an unwinnable situation			2
so he took the only action he could and deleted his e-mail and personal @entity4 account			2
the page mocking the imam remained up			2
the day after his father called , @entity19 says , he got a call from his sister and mother in @entity9			1
they said @entity9 authorities had arrested his father and taken him to @entity212 in @entity15 , a lockup notorious for torturing inmates			1
@entity19 's sister begged him to give up his passwords			1
she pleaded for him to dismantle the @entity4 page about the imam			1
he struggled to explain to her that he did n't control the page and that he had closed all the accounts that he could			0
he told her he had no options			0
" she told me , ' as long as that @entity4 page is open , your father will be in the same situation			1
' " after a few days			0
i received another call , this time from my mother			0
she told me , ' ok , you see they want to execute your father ? why do n't you close that @entity4 page ? ' " at the same time , i can do nothing , " @entity19 said			1
weeks slipped by as @entity19 worried about what to do			0
by june , he decided to publish online an open letter , describing his father 's arrest and explaining that he did n't know who operated the @entity4 page			1
staffers with the @entity243 , a nongovernmental organization based in the @entity244 , saw that letter and called @entity19 to interview him , executive director @entity241 said			0
@entity241 said he feels confident the young man 's story is true			0
" it would be too dangerous for @entity19 's family in @entity9 for him to make up something like this , " @entity241 said			1
" the burden of proof is ( on ) the @entity9 government , and they have n't issued a statement or denied the story			1
it also fits a broader trend of @entity9 intelligence targeting @entity9 activists abroad and their family members			0
" he pointed to the @entity9 rapper as an example and reported intimidation of @entity9 - based relatives of journalists who work for @entity267 , the @entity269 - language service of @entity270			2
" employees of @entity267 believe that their journalism , which attracts over 10 million page views monthly on @entity267 's website , is the motive behind at least 20 incidents this year involving the interrogation and intimidation of their family members in @entity9 by officials of the country 's @entity280 , " according to a news release on the news outlet 's site			1
two accused of ' terrorism ' via @entity4 , @entity286 at a loss inside @entity9 , too , there 's been an uptick in arrests of bloggers and journalists			1
according to the official news site of the @entity9 government , the minister of culture ordered that " current conditions require more unity ( of views ) in the media			2
" @entity299 stated , " there will soon be a conference " with " members of the media and officials of the economy sector " to " enhance their awareness regarding the current conditions of the country , " so " they can work while considering the country 's national interests and to prevent individuals using their personal opinions which , sometimes inadvertently , leads to disturbing the ( society 's ) atmosphere			0
" the minister said he was issuing a final warning to anyone who moved against " national interests			0
" attempts to find any reporting of @entity136 's arrest in state - run media were unsuccessful , as were efforts to reach top officials with the country judiciary or foreign ministry to confirm that the arrest took place			0
in @entity23 in late june , @entity19 was getting very worried about his father			2
" i thought i should tell the public , " he said			0
@entity19 began speaking to the media			0
this week , @entity19 said , he was at a loss			0
" i do n't know what else to do , " he said			0
" i do n't know			0
" i can just hope			0
