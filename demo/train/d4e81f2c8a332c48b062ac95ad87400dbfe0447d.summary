@entity1 's @entity0 is known as the " @entity0 , " but for many of the city 's taxpayers it is really the " @entity6			2
" " it took us 30 years to pay it off and as a taxpayer i 'm not too happy about it , " said one @entity1 resident , echoing the anger that many here still feel about the way the games were funded in 1976			1
" it was not very well managed as a financial project			0
and we have a fabulous stadium , but i think it cost more than all the covered stadia in @entity28 put together , " said @entity20 , former @entity21 vice-president and a prominent resident of the @entity24 city			1
however , @entity20 said calling the @entity1 games of 1976 " the bankrupt @entity31 " is a bad rap , and pointed out that the games actually made money			1
he said they paved the way for a new financial structure and the introduction of lucrative new television rights deals			0
people still come up to him and remember how well the @entity1 games were staged and , in the end , how exciting they were , he added			2
" they were pretty magic			0
all @entity31 are magic but we had @entity44 with her first ' 10 ' and we had the @entity48 brothers and we had @entity49 , " he said			1
" i mean we had some magnificent heroes of the modern @entity31			1
" but there is weariness in @entity1 about being known for staging the @entity31 that almost bankrupted a city			1
the city 's mayor at the time , @entity54 , famously remarked that if the games end up having a deficit , men will have babies			1
and it was in large part due to the @entity0 construction that the statement seems so ridiculous now			0
the @entity31 debt was nearly us $ 1.48 billion , and the stadium itself has been an engineering nightmare -- the retractable roof has struggled to worked properly over the years and almost forced the closure of the entire arena last year amid safety concerns			1
but the city 's current government insists @entity1 has put that legacy behind it and the @entity0 is now a key attraction			2
" now it is paid , and it 's profitable for @entity1 to keep it , " said @entity76 , the councillor in charge of sports and leisure for the city			2
@entity76 pointed out that the legacy of the games has created a sporting city that nurtures hundreds of elite athletes			1
" today @entity1 has more than 1,000 elite athletics and more than 100 coaches			0
and if it 's that high , it 's not a coincidence			0
it is because we decided to keep most of our sporting facilities , " said @entity76			1
one of those facilities is the @entity95 , an impressive training facility for more than a dozen sports that nurtures athletes of all ages			2
during the 76 ' games , the center hosted handball and water polo and was a training center for athletics , swimming and field hockey			2
today , hundreds of aspiring athletes receive access to coaching and equipment , much of it subsidized by the city of @entity1			0
on most days you will find former @entity24 olympian @entity115 here on the track , either indoors or outdoors , or training in the pool or weights room			0
" if i did n't have this center , i probably would n't be at the peak i am , i would not have the career i 've been able to have , " said the sprinter , who competed at the @entity122 in 2008			0
" this center really helped me develop myself , not only as a track athlete but an athlete in general because i have so many other sports around me			0
" i can cross-train , do basketball , soccer , weight training , anything			0

the 1976 @entity135 almost left the city bankrupt with its us $ 1.48 billion - price tag
but former @entity21 vice-president @entity20 said the games were hailed as a sporting *success*
the city retained and invested in its sporting facilities long after the @entity31 finished
