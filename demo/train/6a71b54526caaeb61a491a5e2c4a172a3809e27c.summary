-- the @entity2 cab driver tolerated beatings , arrests and daily indignities during the country 's 16 months of turmoil			1
but after a rocket struck his house in the @entity13 province city of @entity14 last week , the man and his family finally had enough			0
the 29 - year - old @entity16 man , his wife , two young daughters and other relations left their homes on july 16 and embarked on a journey at night to the nearby @entity23 border			0
he was among the more than 120,000 people who 've fled to the neighboring countries -- @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity23 -- to escape the warring in @entity2			1
@entity2 military stretched amid defection , fighting the @entity32 high commissioner for refugees , @entity33 , on friday expressed his growing concern for the dramatic flight			1
" with the spread of deadly violence , i am gravely concerned for the thousands of @entity2 civilians and refugees who have been forced to flee their homes , " @entity33 said			1
the driver 's story punctuates the misery across the restive nation , engulfed in what is now regarded as a civil war between @entity2 president @entity48 's government and its foes			1
the cabbie is one of millions who have had to wrestle with whether they should brave staying or resort to leaving			0
the man , who answered questions from @entity0 via translators at the @entity57 resettlement camp in @entity23 , did n't want his name used			0
but he cited many factors that led to what was a spontaneous trip to the border			0
" it had been increasingly difficult to work as a driver due to stricter and more frequent road checkpoints and fear of random arrests and imprisonment , " he said			0
" everybody in @entity13 is being targeted by @entity2 security because the revolution started there			1
" the miseries of daily life hit home , he said			2
" shopping for milk for the children was risky			2
" he had been apprehended twice , once in june 2011 when he was arrested in his taxi at a checkpoint and beaten up while taking a man to visit his wife , in labor at a hospital			0
two months later , he was arrested while waiting in his taxi for three men in a money - exchange shop			0
security officers accused the three of arranging a demonstration			0
they arrested the men and the taxi driver			0
the driver was beaten up			0
@entity93 fleeing @entity2 swells he was scared about the psychological well - being of his daughter , growing anxious over the sounds of gunfire and war			1
he thinks that his participation in peaceful demonstrations may have put him at great risk			0
he and his family , along with two of his sisters and their children , went to an assembly where the @entity109 helps fleeing @entity2			1
women and children traveled to the border in vehicles and the men walked as the @entity23 army waited for them to arrive			2
the cab driver said he and the other refugees regularly commiserate about life			2
" the greatest difficulties are leaving houses , their country and their life			2
it is difficult to accept , but there is no choice because of the children , " the driver said			2
" seeking asylum is the worst thing in life			0
" @entity32 refugee officials , neighboring governments and non-governmental agencies have been working to help refugees , and the @entity32 recently launched a drive for $ 193 million to help refugees			1
the plan has received about a quarter of the amount needed			0
@entity2 have been trickling out of the country during the conflict but those numbers have tripled since april , the @entity32 refugee agency said			1
the latest @entity32 number is that as of wednesday , 120,000 have sought protection but the refugee agency says the local governments count many more			2
time to drop the @entity147 plan the number of @entity2 now in camps in @entity26 has surpassed 43,000 , disaster and emergency officials from that country said			1
the @entity32 refugee agency said recently it has registered well over 30,000 in both @entity28 and @entity23			2
but the flight is fluid			2
there are reports of 8,500 to 30,000 people crossing into @entity28 in a two - day period			0
more than 8,000 have crossed the border into @entity27			1
" i am extremely grateful @entity23 , @entity28 , @entity27 and @entity26 have maintained open borders , " @entity33 said			1
one irony is that @entity27 who had fled to @entity2 because of war and instability have been touched by the unrest			1
some , for example , have had to flee the @entity167 suburb of @entity168 , and an @entity27 family was found dead in @entity167			1
" i fear for the civilians caught up in the violence in @entity167 , including the large @entity27 refugee population residing there , " @entity33 said			1
@entity27 prime minister @entity173 deplored the attack against @entity27 and urged his fellow citizens to return			1
he said on friday those who do n't " have blood on their hands " will be forgiven , a reference to violence during the war			0
" we appeal to the @entity32 to intervene promptly and in cooperation with the @entity2 authorities to protect @entity27 and help them and to facilitate the process of return to @entity27 , " he said			1
@entity32 officials say they think the flight inside the country is greater than the flight across its borders			1
maybe as many as a million have fled , but it is impossible to determine an accurate figure of internally displaced people , the @entity32 refugee agency said			2
as for the refugees , @entity197 , @entity2 regional refugee coordinator for the @entity32 , said many cross through unofficial border points during the night			1
about 75 percent of those registered by the @entity32 are women and children , and most of them are @entity16 , who make up the majority of @entity2 and a bulk of the opposition to @entity48 's regime			1
@entity197 said the sprawling and restive @entity211 province has been the top place of refugee origin			1
people have fled @entity167 and its suburbs as well as @entity13 in recent days as fighting persists			2
people leave simply because they no longer feel safe			2
many are destitute or have depleted savings and arrive with only the " clothes on their back			0
" @entity197 said there 's a " direct correlation between fighting and a wave of refugees			1
" " people escaped from areas where there 's been heavy shelling , " he said			2
" ... they arrive quite traumatized and in an emotional fragile state			0
" they are relying entirely on humanitarian assistance , even though there are some employment opportunities , such as farm work in @entity23 , he said			0
the governments , the @entity32 and non-government groups are providing food , schooling , and health care , and are steering refugees to or providing them with accommodations , either in camps or apartments			2
each country where people seek refuge poses different conditions and challenges			2
the security situation in @entity28 is extremely fragile , officials and observers say			0
there has been fighting in @entity258 between @entity260 and @entity261 groups			0
@entity197 said @entity26 has well - organized refugee camps and the country has served as a passage for traveling to other nations			1
@entity266 is gearing up for third - country nationals as it did during the @entity270 - @entity269 war last decade			0
many of the refugees to @entity27 are young @entity2 @entity273 men who want to avoid military service			1
that group tends to go to @entity27 's @entity273 region			1
some refugees are living with friends are families and do n't register with the @entity32			0
some fear @entity2 government retribution if they sign up with the @entity32 , creating a paper trail			1
a 38 - year - old salesman in the town of @entity285 , in @entity13 province , left @entity2 with his wife and five children after the impact of a missile hurt her and another missile killed a neighbor			1
they immediately decided to flee @entity2 before their children were killed			1
living there had been an ordeal , as an environment once harmonious had become replete with attacks and funerals			0
" @entity2 used to live together -- kurds , @entity302 and all @entity303 without discrimination , " but @entity48 is " planting discrimination , " he said			1
the @entity307 call to prayer , he said , has been changed from " @entity309 " to " @entity310			0
" he said pro-government @entity312 militia members once violently coaxed him to pray to @entity48 instead of @entity313			0
he said " i love @entity48 " to cooperate , but would n't pray to him , even with a gun to his head			0
the salesman followed his brothers ' examples			0
one escaped to @entity28 and another to @entity322			0
but he worries that his married sisters are remaining in @entity2 and his parents refuse to leave			1
" he would go back to @entity2 today if it were safe , but the reality is dangerous , " the translator who spoke to the salesman said			1
" therefore , for now , he does not know where he will live ; the problem is financial			0
a sponsor will not provide everything			0
he does not know about the cost of rent , cooking , etc. he does not know if he can support his family			0
" why @entity2 could get even uglier			2

there 's a " direct correlation " between fighting and refugee flight
children 's safety is a top factor in deciding to leave the country
