@entity0 , @entity1 -- you 'd have to have been hiding down a , er , @entity5 hole , to miss the hubbub			1
you can fly to @entity1 , where the @entity5 premieres on wednesday , on a @entity5 - branded plane -- complete with a @entity5 - inspired safety video with @entity9 , telling you how to keep safe , if the flight approaches its own @entity11			1
when you arrive in the self - styled @entity13 ( @entity0 , my home town ) of @entity15 , a giant @entity16 , reaching for a fish , hangs from the airport terminal 's ceiling			1
on the short ride into the city you 'll see the @entity5 - themed flags fluttering in @entity0 's persistent wind before a giant @entity24 hovers into view			1
he is perched on the @entity28 's verandah , standing outside a delightfully rendered @entity5 hole , waiting to welcome the stars and thousands who will watch them parade down the red carpet			2
will the movie receive critical acclaim -- or @entity37 reception ? whatever happens , the marketing has been brilliant			0
@entity1 's taxpayers have been helping subsidize 14 % , or us $ 82m , of the films ( which cost close to nz $ 700m , or us $ 575m )			1
while the @entity43 psyche adores nothing more than being told how wonderful our little country is , we need more than that as a return on our investment			2
prime minister @entity49 , who helped woo the @entity51 executives when they threatened to film elsewhere , has said it 's good value for money because it 's far less than the nz $ 300m ( us $ 246m ) the @entity57 trilogy cost the country			1
he argues it is all money well spent on creating jobs and that the cross-promotional benefits will return a treasure to please even smaug the dragon			0
@entity9 , meanwhile , has popped out of the editing room in the past few days to remind everyone that the subsidies helped ensure that the films were made here			2
big studios do not make decisions based on " sentimentality , " he said , and there was a real danger of the films being shot in @entity75 or @entity76			1
stars , fans turn out in droves for ' @entity5 ' premiere there have been many benefits besides the jobs -- such as celebrity spotting			2
@entity86 ate across from us one night -- he was quite underwhelming , short , plain and , worse , minus @entity88			0
he really needs that blond hair - do to give him a lift			0
we also spotted @entity91 ( who plays a dwarf ) having a nice time with his family at a @entity96 joint near @entity9 's burgeoning studio complex			0
he even appeared relaxed about sitting by the loo -- quite handy because i kept swinging past to see what they were up to			0
many more @entity1 will be waiting by the red carpet , hoping for their own little bit of movie tinsel			0
they deserve to be treated to a show , as they 've certainly paid enough of their share of the admission already .			0
