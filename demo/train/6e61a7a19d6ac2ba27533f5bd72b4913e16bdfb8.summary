-- @entity1 insisted friday that it has dibs on rocket engines sitting deep on the @entity5 floor , a day after a wealthy adventurer announced the discovery of the prized pieces of space history			1
@entity11 founder and ceo @entity10 revealed thursday that , using deep - sea sonar , a team had found the @entity16 engines that powered the @entity18 rocket carrying @entity19 and the @entity21 mission to the moon " lying 14,00 feet below the surface			1
" " we 're making plans to attempt to raise one or more of them from the ocean floor , " the billionaire investor and entrepreneur wrote			0
@entity1 administrator @entity31 , in his own statement friday , applauded @entity10 and his team for their " historic find " and wished them " all the luck in the world			1
" at the same time , he stated that any @entity39 engine that 's recovered belongs to the space agency			1
" @entity1 does retain ownership of any artifacts recovered and would likely offer one of the @entity18 f - 1 engines to the @entity47 's @entity46 in @entity48 under longstanding arrangements with the institution , " @entity41 said			1
the @entity1 administrator added that he 'd directed staff " to provide a smooth and expeditious disposition of any flight hardware recovered			1
" @entity10 himself requested , in a message to @entity1 , that an f - 1 engine or another space artifact be put on display at the @entity60 in @entity61			1
this could still happen if the " @entity47 declines " to take an engine that 's raised from the ocean 's depths " or if a second engine is recovered , " according to the @entity1 administrator			1
" i sincerely hope all continues to go well for @entity10 and @entity70 , and that his team enjoys success and prosperity in every endeavor , " said @entity41 , referring to the @entity10 - led venture into space flight			1
" all of us at @entity1 have our fingers crossed for success in his upcoming expedition of exploration and discovery			2
" @entity10 said thursday that the condition of the discovered engines , which slammed into the ocean more than 42 years ago and have been in the saltwater ever since , is n't known			1
" on the other hand , they 're made of tough stuff , so we 'll see , " he said			0
each of the engines weighs nearly nine tons , and they came in a cluster of five			0
they provided 32 million horsepower by burning 6,000 pounds of fuel every second , and the five together propelled the largest rocket in history up 38 miles in under three minutes			0
after doing their work , the rockets plummeted into the ocean , where they had been undiscovered for more than four decades			0
@entity1 had some clues as to where they landed , and a piece of the debris landed on a @entity107 merchant ship , providing more clues			2
@entity109 , a space memorabilia expert who runs @entity112 , said 65 of these engines were launched			2
he said if the engines can be brought to the surface and a serial number can be found , it would be easy to authenticate the find			2
but bringing them up could be a challenge			0
" if all five are still clumped together , it will be like trying to bring up the big part of the @entity124 , " @entity109 said			0
@entity10 made his announcement days after another wealthy , high - profile adventurer -- @entity127 -- made deep - sea history himself , as the first person to explore solo the deepest spot in all the world 's oceans , in the @entity133			2
also this week , sir @entity134 used millions to fund his attempts to travel around the globe in a balloon			0
@entity109 said @entity10 ' disclosure came as a complete surprise to the space memorabilia world			2
" but that fits into the way he does business , " @entity109 said , referring to @entity141 , which aims to make human spaceflight cheaper and easier			0
" @entity10 and that @entity141 have always played their cards very close to their chest and often do n't share their milestones until after they have succeeded			0
" @entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0

@entity11 founder @entity10 says he 's found engines used to power @entity21
they are on the @entity5 floor , at 14,000 feet , in *unknown* condition , he says
@entity1 chief says the space agency has " ownership of any artifacts recovered "
