eighty percent of officers believe it is unreasonable to expect the @entity5 military to wage another major war successfully at present			1
@entity24 and the @entity25 on tuesday issued the @entity26 , a survey of 3,400 present and former @entity5 military officers			1
" we asked the officers whether they thought the @entity5 military was stronger or weaker than it was five years ago , " said @entity29 , who helped write the report			1
" sixty percent said the @entity5 military is weaker than it was five years ago , " @entity29 told reporters			1
the report found that officers " see a military apparatus severely strained by the grinding demands of war			2
" more than half of the officers responding cited the wars in @entity3 and @entity43 , and the " pace of troop deployments " needed for those conflicts , the survey said			2
the report comes a few weeks before the five - year anniversary of the @entity3 war , where a troop " surge " is winding down by summer			1
the @entity5 military is proposing a pause in troop reductions for a period of review before any more decisions on withdrawals			1
the officers have " an overwhelmingly negative view " of many of the early decisions shaping the @entity3 war , but most believe the present @entity5 counterinsurgency strategy and troop increases are good omens for success in @entity3			1
a majority of officers in the @entity3 war say some policy decisions have " hindered the prospects for success there			1
" " these include shortening the time units spend at home between deployments and accepting more recruits who do not meet the military 's standards			0

" the officers believe " that either @entity110 or @entity111 , not the @entity5 , is emerging as the strategic victor " in the @entity3 war			1
" the @entity5 has been preoccupied away from @entity117 , " said @entity114 , the head of the group that conducted the survey			0
@entity110 's rising influence worldwide predates the war but is part of a " great game under way in @entity117 for influence , for relationships , " @entity114 said			0
the @entity5 focus on @entity3 " sends a message to our friends and others that maybe we 're not as focused on the drama that 's playing out there , " he said			2
@entity111 has gained from the war because of the removal of @entity3 " as a strategic counterweight , " the report said			0
the survey portrayed @entity111 , the @entity138 ( where tensions have flared between @entity110 and @entity138 ) , @entity140 and @entity141 as four potential hot spots and sought opinions of how prepared the @entity5 is " to successfully fight a major combat operation there			2
