-- an angry @entity1 hinted at legal action for being accused of " cheating " by fellow @entity5 professional @entity4			1
the world number two carded a two - under 70 to be four shots behind third round leader @entity8 at the @entity9 , but for the second day in a row his post-round press conference centered on his use of a 20 - year - old wedge with square grooves			1
@entity4 was quoted in the @entity15 on friday , saying that @entity1 and others who had opted to play with the @entity18 wedge were exploiting a loophole in @entity5 rules			1
" it 's cheating , and i 'm appalled @entity1 has put it in play , " he said			2

" asked he was mounting a lawsuit , @entity1 said , " i 'm not going into specifics what that meant			0
" meanwhile , the @entity5 has issued a statement to explain why the controversial @entity18 wedges were approved for play , appearing to criticize @entity4 for his comments			1

@entity1 said that it was " cool if they put that out there			0
