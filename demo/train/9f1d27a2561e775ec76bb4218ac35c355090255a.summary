-- still think @entity1 is just for the kids ? you wo n't -- not when you 've seen @entity0 's gut - twisting , down - right disgusting mob of morbid maniacs			1
it 's that time of year when revelers can let loose with their desire to shock			2
getting dressed up ready to terrorize friends , family and strangers in the street has long been the goal for the holiday -- but a few partiers are taking it to another level , with masterfully executed , @entity19 - standard disguises			0
this @entity1 , @entity20 challenged you to scare us stiff			1
and ireporters from across the globe delivered -- with a ghoul 's gallery of ghastly getups , macabre makeup , and grotesque prosthetics , guaranteed to cause some sleepless nights			0
this @entity1 , there 'll be tricks ... " what is a @entity1 costume if not to be scary ? " asked 26 - year - old @entity32 , whose ripped - off flesh makeup shocked and turned stomachs			1
@entity37 , an amateur paranormal investigator from @entity38 , agrees : " i love scaring people ! " she says			0
" for my costume , i wanted something that would send grown men running to their mommas			0
" her creation " @entity45 " succeeded -- a blood - dripping horror with gouged - out eyes , which she turned on unsuspecting visitors at @entity50 's @entity49 in @entity51 , @entity38			1
there 's a perfect form of trickery and illusion required to create a properly adult scare -- although , children and ( ahem ) dogs are n't afraid to get involved -- but @entity37 says the secret behind truly terrifying outfits is all too simple : " i think the more realistic the costume is , the better			2
sure , vampires and zombies are cool , but what is really freaky are the costumes that are basically normal people , but with some type of creepy or disturbing element added			0
" ... and treats but there 's more to the night than shock and disgust			2
for @entity74 ( a photographer for 364 days a year -- @entity76 for october 31st ) it 's an outlet for his gruesome creativity : " i 'm a creative person and @entity1 allows me to let my imagination run wild and display it in a very public way that ca n't be done the rest of the year , " he says			1
" it 's a chance to change into someone else entirely and take a vacation from yourself and enjoy being a character for a night or more " for others , @entity1 holds the opportunity to get together and share in the scares : whether in a family group ( like the gloriously grizzly , undead @entity94 family ) , or in a terrifying mass with @entity99 's @entity98 mob			1
there , hundreds of undead tricksters gathered together -- ready to groan , share their common interests ( like braaaains ) , trudge menacingly through sightseeing spots , and dance to @entity106			0
and , in the true spirit of the holiday , scare strangers to death .			0

every @entity1 , horror fans take the opportunity to scare others stiff
now , *hardcore* @entity1 *aficionados* are creating horrifying new costumes
oh no ! is ... is that woman 's face coming *unzipped* ? !
i think i 'm going to be sick ...
