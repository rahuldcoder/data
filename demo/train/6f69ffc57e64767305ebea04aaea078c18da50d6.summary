@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 repeats my question back to me , chuckling			1
" what is the @entity1 media saying about the @entity8 elections ? " he pauses , thinking how best to answer			1
" man , the situation is so bad now , we only pay attention to staying alive			2
an @entity1 journalist who works for several international news organizations , @entity3 tells me that he only narrowly escaped being killed by a car bomb the previous day			2
" if i had been a few minutes late for work , you would n't be able to talk to me			2
" @entity3 chuckles again like so many people do in @entity0 , a resilient , tough , warm laugh			1
it 's been nine years since the @entity8 and its allies invaded @entity1 and toppled @entity23			1
and although the war officially ended when @entity8 combat troops withdrew at the end of 2011 , it 's far from peace time here			1
postcard : " ignore us at your peril , " @entity29 say although violence in @entity1 is down significantly since 2006 and 2007 , bombings , kidnappings , and assassinations are part of everyday life across the country			1
the @entity41 database estimates that seven people have been killed every single day by suicide and car bomb attacks this year			1
the bomb that missed @entity3 killed at least seven people			2
at 6:30 a.m. the following morning , i 'm met more with confusion than humor when i ask the same thing of a group of day laborers in the rundown neighborhood of @entity53			2
" we only watch football , " says one man			2
" we do n't care about elections			2
" in fact , only one of the workers in the group of 40 or so standing around even knows that there 's an election going on in the @entity8			1
@entity64 , a 25 - year - old from @entity65 , catches my attention			2
like everyone else on the corner , he is wearing a generic threadbare soccer tracksuit , the ubiquitous uniform of the terminally poor			2
postcard : @entity72 fear what follows @entity8 election @entity64 came to @entity0 after graduating from university with a degree in @entity77			1
he wanted to be a teacher , but could n't find a job back home so came to the capital to work			2
@entity64 makes 25,000 iqd day ( $ 20 ) if he manages to find work , which he only does about three days a week			0
he tells me he 'll take any kind of work , including the most dangerous job in @entity1 : policeman			0
when i ask him why , his answer is so universal it could have come from any one of the millions of @entity8 still suffering from the financial crisis : " all i want is a job so i can take care of my family			1
" he leans forward to tell me something else , but a middle aged man pushes his way through the crowd and tells me i 'd better leave			0
the group standing around me is drawing attention to itself and we 're now making a perfect target for a bomb attack			0
traffic squeezes its way around @entity0 's clogged streets , which are pinched every few miles by military checkpoints where bored soldiers lazily hold metal rods â € ” nicknamed " @entity109 's cane " â € ” next to passing cars , in the hope they will " sniff " out hidden bombs			1
postcard : should @entity8 raise fist to @entity116 ? the cars gridlocked in traffic make it clear that although @entity0 is still dangerous , it certainly is n't poor			1
among the old and beat up vehicles are plenty of brand new land cruisers , @entity124 , @entity126 series , and black @entity127			0
these are not the armored versions that move in convoys from fortified location to fortified location -- they are the personal cars of the city 's middle class			0
in the evenings the city 's wealthy roam the streets of @entity138 , in the center of the city , where the lights shine almost as bright as @entity142			0
here you can indulge in handmade ice cream , or splash out on the latest @entity146 fashions			0
with oil exports in @entity1 at a 30 - year high ( august 's revenues were $ 8.4 billion ) , a lot of well - positioned people are getting extremely wealthy			2
more : get latest news at @entity153 here there is a vague understanding of the two different candidates for those that watch the international @entity160 language channels such as @entity161 and @entity162			0
not surprisingly , @entity164 's party is deeply unpopular			1
@entity165 , a leader of the @entity167 ethnic minority , explains that the " republicans make trouble for the @entity8 @entity168 will create tension with the @entity160 world			1
" someone else tells me , " @entity174 is a peaceful man , but if @entity175 is elected he 'll damage @entity160			0
i do n't know his policy but when i see his face he looks like the devil			0
" the most nuanced view , however , comes from @entity180 , a highly respected @entity181 religious leader : " there 's not a big difference between @entity184 and @entity168			1
i do n't trust either candidate because they are both influenced by lobbyists			0
@entity8 policy is actually against the @entity8 people			1
in 2003 @entity8 protested against the war , but they were n't heard			1
" postcard : why @entity192 longs for @entity8 election @entity194 do n't trust @entity8 politicians , but neither do they trust their own			1
" the government is full of thieves , " 23 - year - old @entity196 tells me in his home in @entity199 , a dangerous neighborhood in northwest @entity0			1
@entity203 , in fact , is what most @entity194 talk about when they talk politics			0
@entity1 's parliament is in a constant state of dysfunction ; warring coalitions block each other at every turn and assassinations and police brutality are used as political tools			0
@entity196 does n't care for politics			0
he 's a college kid whose life is dominated by working , studying , and just surviving			0
a year ago he was injured in a bomb attack in his neighborhood and then just a few weeks ago another bomb went off near his house , killing three of his friends			2
@entity196 tells me all of this in a very matter - of - fact way , and i ask him why he seems so unaffected by it			0
i 'm so sorry about their families			0
but what can i do ? this is normal for us			0
if you see your friend today , you do n't see him tomorrow			0
" as he pauses , the electricity cuts out and the ceiling fan stops turning			0
even with the oil exports , new cars , and imported fashions , basic services in @entity0 are still terrible			1
on average @entity194 receive eight to 12 hours of national electricity a day , which makes life in the summer -- when temperatures easily reach 120 degrees -- almost unbearable			0
even in september , once the ceiling fan has stopped rotating , the room immediately begins to heat up			0
@entity196 gestures at everyone sitting in the room sweating and he finally answers my question about what he thinks of the @entity8 election			1
" i do n't think that a change of @entity8 presidents will have any effect on @entity1 , " he says and then a huge grin spreads across his face and he starts to laugh that unique , resilient @entity255 laugh .			1

@entity8 troops withdrew last year , but the violence continues in @entity0
@entity168 party still seen as the party of @entity164 by many in @entity0
many who follow the election see little difference between @entity184 , @entity168
