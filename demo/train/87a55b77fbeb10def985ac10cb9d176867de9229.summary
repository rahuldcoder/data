@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 rage over the burning of qurans by @entity7 troops continued thursday even after a president @entity8 apologized for the " error			1
" @entity1 erupted in violent demonstrations after the troops burned the @entity13 religious material at the beginning of the week			1
two @entity16 troops were killed thursday by a man wearing an @entity20 uniform , a @entity16 official said , asking not to be named discussing casualties			1
the gunman is thought to have been acting in conjunction with a protest outside the base , the official said			1
in a letter delivered to @entity1 president @entity27 , @entity8 called the act " inadvertent , " @entity27 's office and @entity31 spokesman @entity30 said thursday			1
" we will take the appropriate steps to avoid any recurrence , including holding accountable those responsible , " @entity8 said in the letter delivered by @entity33 , the @entity16 ambassador to @entity1			1
@entity27 said that he had appointed a team composed of @entity40 legal scholars from the @entity41 of @entity42 to travel to @entity43 and investigate			0
@entity8 's apology brought this rejoinder from @entity47 presidential candidate @entity46 : " the president apologized for the burning , but i have n't seen the president demand that the government of @entity1 apologize for the killing of two young @entity16			1
" the protest and shootings came as the @entity55 called on @entity40 to attack @entity7 military bases and convoys and to kill soldiers following the admission that @entity7 troops had incinerated the books at @entity62			1
@entity1 officials investigating urged @entity1 to " exercise self - restraint " and " avoid resorting to protests and demonstrations that may provide ground for the enemy to take advantage of the situation			1
" the investigators called the burning " insulting and shameful , " saying @entity7 officials had promised to bring the " perpetrators of the crime ... to justice as soon as possible			0
" " as the situation is still under investigation , it would be premature to speculate on any potential outcomes , " said @entity78 spokesman lt. col. @entity77			0
" any disciplinary action , if deemed warranted , will be taken by @entity16 authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process			1
" @entity40 believe the @entity91 is the word of @entity92 , so holy that people should wash their hands before even touching the sacred book			0
desecrating the quran is seen as an act of intolerance and bigotry			0
at least two demonstrators also were killed in the exchange of gunfire near the base where the two @entity16 died , said haji @entity104 , chief of @entity106 district in eastern @entity107			1
two @entity16 soldiers and seven demonstrators were injured in the clash , too , he said			1
" we do n't know who started the shooting first and what kind of guns were used , but we have started our investigation to find out the details of the incident , " @entity104 told @entity2			0
another demonstration occurred near a @entity124 - run @entity123 compound in @entity125 , the provincial capital of @entity127 province , a regional police spokesman said			0
@entity1 security forces prevented the 700 to 800 demonstrators from entering the compound , said police spokesman @entity128 said			2
they burned a few civilian vehicles parked near the compound , he added			0
@entity16 diplomats in @entity0 and the north and south of @entity1 were on lockdown for a second day in the face of protests , @entity16 @entity135 spokesman @entity134 said			1
at least five people were killed wednesday in demonstrations			2
the commander of @entity7 's @entity144 , gen. @entity145 , apologized tuesday			0
the materials had been gathered for disposal and were inadvertently given to troops for burning , @entity145 said			0
" it was not a decision that was made with respect to the faith of @entity13 , " he said			0
" it was a mistake			0
the moment we found out about it , we immediately stopped and we intervened			0
" the @entity55 on thursday rejected the apology			2
in an e-mail , the @entity159 militia accused " the invading infidel authorities " of trying to calm the situation with two " so - called show ( s ) of apologies , but in reality they let their inhuman soldiers insult our holy book			0
" they called on @entity1 to take revenge " until the doers of such inhumane actions are prosecuted and punished			2
" " we should attack their military bases , their military convoys , we should kill their soldiers , arrest their invading soldiers , beat them up and give a kind of lesson to them that they never dare to insult the holy quran , " the message said			0
@entity1 religious scholar @entity181 said it can be appropriate to burn a damaged quran to dispose of it , but that it should be done by a @entity40 performing the act respectfully			1
" i ca n't tell you whether @entity16 intentionally burned the copies of the @entity91 to make @entity40 angry or if they did it mistakenly , " he said , but said their " carelessness " was " a crime they have committed against the holiest book of 2 billion @entity40 around the world			1
" a military official told @entity2 on thursday that it was unclear how many qurans were involved and that some had been partially burned			2
the inability of most @entity16 troops at the base to read the texts could have contributed to the mistake , the official said , asking not to be named discussing an ongoing investigation			1
a second military official said the materials had been removed from a detainee center 's library because they contained " extremist inscriptions " and there was " an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications			0
" @entity16 apologies have not appeased @entity1 , who massed outside the @entity43 base tuesday , chanting " death to @entity16 ! death to the @entity1 government ! long live @entity13 ! " protesters burned tires and threw rocks wednesday outside @entity223 near @entity224 , the @entity16 @entity135 said in its official @entity226 feed			1
in @entity228 , hundreds chanted " @entity229			0
" authorities have questioned some troops as part of their investigation , but no one has been detained , a coalition official said			2
last year , when @entity237 pastor @entity236 presided over what he called a trial of the @entity91 and burned a copy , @entity1 took to the streets			2
in the northern @entity1 city of @entity244 , demonstrators stormed a @entity246 office and killed 12 people			1
in @entity249 , three people were killed , and nine in another when police clashed with stone - throwing demonstrators			2
