@entity0 -- in 1842 , when @entity0 became a @entity4 crown colony after the first @entity5 , it was described by a very unimpressed @entity4 foreign secretary , @entity6 , as a barren rock with nary a house on it			1
he also added , prophetically and spectacularly incorrectly , " it will never be a mart for trade			0
" of course , by 1997 , when @entity0 was handed back by the @entity4 to become a @entity14 ( @entity14 ) of @entity15 , it was a modern metropolis of well over six million souls , used to a free economy , a free press and the rule of law			1
according to the agreement hammered out between @entity4 and @entity15 , the territory would remain that way for at least 50 years			1
under @entity15 rule , @entity0 would govern itself , choose its own leaders , control its own economy and maintain its own legal system			1
but there were many skeptics			0
would @entity15 really be able to keep its hands off ? fifteen years later , almost a third of the way through those 50 years , are those promises still being kept ? how has the territory changed ? @entity34 has a unique perspective			1
she was a legislator during the last years of the @entity4 colony and again in the early years of the @entity39 feisty democrat politician , no one would ever accuse her of being in the " pro-beijing " camp			1
if you look at the people of @entity0 , she said , their daily lives really have n't changed very much			2
indeed , @entity0 has its own borders and immigration control , even with @entity15			1
it has its own currency , its own police force and system of law courts			0
it has freedom of expression and demonstration to a degree unheard of anywhere on the mainland			2
it 's the only place in @entity15 , for example , that can commemorate the june 4 , 1989 crackdown against the students in @entity61			2
the territory also has its own legislature and chief executive			0
@entity65 has always promised to be hands - off , allowing the @entity0 people to rule @entity0 , but many still feel it has undue influence in local politics and in an electoral system that favors pro-beijing candidates			1
@entity15 's huge presence is inescapable			2
" our unease in @entity0 is that the mainland is so big and we are so small			2
we are a small city of seven million people			0
it is easy for us to be physically overwhelmed			0
i think that is our fear , " @entity80 said			0
since the handover , trade ties between @entity0 and @entity15 have strengthened so much so that @entity0 is now the mainland 's biggest source of foreign investment , state news service @entity83 reported , quoting @entity15 's ministry of commerce			1
@entity0 is also the top destination for investment from the mainland			2
trade between the two surged nearly 600 % to us $ 284 billion from 1996 , the year before the handover , and last year , @entity83 said			0
and ties are only set to strengthen			0
in the days leading to the 15 year anniversary , @entity15 announced a package of policies to further bind the mainland and the island covering trade , finance , education science and technology and tourism			1
but the prospect of tighter ties with their homeland is not necessarily being welcomed by @entity109 , many of whom feel that while @entity15 money has boosted business , it has also put pressure on public services			2
earlier this year , full page advertisements appeared in the local media , bluntly calling mainlanders " locusts " and accusing them of driving up property prices and squeezing @entity109 out of their own hospitals and schools			0
" we have a love - hate relationship with @entity15 , " said @entity0 entrepreneur @entity126 , whose popular chain of stores selling furnishings and knick - knacks celebrates a unique @entity0 style			1
he is adamant that @entity0 should hold onto its differences			2
" i disagree that you have to choose between being a @entity0 person or a @entity15 person			1
like a @entity137 , a @entity137 is both a @entity137 and an @entity138 , and i am a @entity109 as well as being a @entity15 person , " @entity126 said			0
" so i think there is nothing wrong with @entity0 being a part of mainland @entity15 or being a @entity15 city			1
all i am saying is that @entity0 should maintain its differences in its regional identity			0
" @entity1 asked people on the streets of @entity0 what the difference was between @entity109 and the @entity15			1
" many of us were educated in @entity154 countries and went abroad for a university education so naturally our cultural background is different from those @entity15 nationals who were born and raised in @entity15 , " one man said			0
" i do n't know much about @entity15 , " one woman said in @entity159			0
" the problems in @entity15 right now make me think that i should not consider myself @entity15 , " she added			0
however , one woman who described herself as a @entity15 person who was born in @entity0 said , " @entity0 people and @entity15 people are basically the same			1
the only difference between the two is that they are born in different places			0

@entity0 marks 15 years since the handover from @entity4 to @entity15 rule
the island became a @entity4 colony after the first @entity5 in 1842
@entity4 and @entity15 agreed that @entity0 should remain independent for 50 years
@entity0 has its own borders , laws , currency and freedom of expression
