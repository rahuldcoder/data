@entity0 -- the word compromise is never music to the ears of passionate advocates for a cause			2
this is especially true for advocates of overturning the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " law , a law that was supposed to be a suitable compromise itself in 1993			0
but when idealism collides with political reality , risk avoidance and workable solutions become the goal			0
the deal that was reached on @entity19 this week between the @entity20 , the @entity21 , gay rights groups ( including my own ) , and pro-repeal champions on @entity25 is that workable solution and will get us where we need to go			1
more than 14,000 proudly serving men and women have been abruptly fired from the military pursuant to the @entity19 law , and many more have voluntarily left the military because of the burden of serving under this unnecessary restriction			1
the @entity19 law prevents our armed forces from being able to recruit and retain troops from the largest possible pool of talent , and it is a stain on the integrity of our nation			1
we can not afford to wait until next year to lock in full legislative repeal			0
our country needs this now			0
the risks of waiting until after the midterm elections to address @entity19 legislatively were simply too great			1
it is possible that the pro-repeal majority could lose seats in november , and could even lose control of one chamber of @entity51			0
if it passes , this deal will get the looming legislative battle over with			2
it will also free up the @entity21 to implement the recommendations of its @entity56 on @entity19 when it finally releases its road map for a smooth transition in december			1
the @entity21 and the president will not have to return to @entity51 for permission on implementing repeal -- the legislation hammered out in this week 's agreement will already have authorized the change			1
this deal is not perfect , but unlike the 1993 @entity19 law , which codified a de facto gay ban in the military , this new legislation would firmly establish the mechanisms for ending the gay ban once and for all			1
more importantly , it would do so in a way that has achieved coveted @entity21 support -- a critical requirement for any @entity19 repeal legislation			1
but there were three concessions that repeal supporters reluctantly agreed to in order to pick up @entity20 and @entity21 support			1
these concessions , however , do not compromise the goal of full legislative repeal of @entity19			1
the first is an option that the progressive community had already resigned itself to : delayed implementation			0
while my organization has long argued that including a delay provision would be the only politically viable way to secure legislative repeal soon , this model for language only recently caught on in the rest of the pro-repeal community			0
this part of the deal was a given			2
the second concession was allowing the president , the secretary of defense , and the chairman of the @entity106 to decide together the date on which the new law , once passed , would actually take effect			0
the three are already public supporters of repeal and can be trusted to act in good faith			2
they may not certify the implementation plan as quickly as some repeal advocates would like ( some have unrealistically suggested a matter of days or weeks after the working group issues its report ) , but i believe that they will within a reasonable amount of time			0
after all , even the commandant of the @entity122 , gen. @entity123 -- the staunchest opponent of this policy change -- testified before the @entity125 earlier this year that if this change became inevitable , even he would recommend making the change as swiftly as possible just to get it over with			0
the third and final concession -- and the most controversial -- was the removal of the affirmative non-discrimination provision from the legislative language			0
this provision would have legally prevented the @entity21 from ever engaging in discriminatory practices towards gay and lesbian troops again			1
although i am not convinced this was necessary to pick up any additional support for repeal , in light of concessions that were already in the works , it is important to keep in mind that statutory non-discrimination language would have been above and beyond what other minority groups have been given through military personnel policy legislation			1
an administrative or regulatory non-discrimination policy , such as that accorded women and african - americans , will be more than sufficient to ensure that lesbian , gay and bisexual service members are protected from discriminatory practices or policies			2
even if this deal makes it over its biggest hurdles this week -- a @entity159 vote and a vote on the floor of the @entity162 -- there will still be much work ahead			2
the president and secretary of defense @entity165 must be pressed to ensure that the @entity21 's working group does not get off track , as shamefully did happen with the @entity168 on @entity19 in 1993			1
and the president should strongly consider creating a civilian oversight and advisory group to help make a smooth transition to a @entity174 military , as was done for ensuring smooth policy changes on women through the creation of the @entity178 on women in the @entity180			0
president @entity181 recently revived this commission for women , and it would behoove the administration to create a similar commission for this policy change			0
if this legislation clears these two major hurdles this week , it will undoubtedly be the final nail in the coffin of the outdated and onerous @entity19 law			1
this policy change is the best thing for our country and for our military , and it should be supported			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

more than 14,000 troops fired because of " @entity19 , " says @entity202
deal on @entity19 between @entity20 , @entity21 , gay rights groups , is good , says @entity199
new legislation would firmly establish the mechanisms for ending gay ban , he says
@entity199 : most importantly , it would do so with coveted @entity21 support
