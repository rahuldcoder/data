-- an @entity3 police dive team will search the site where an underwater photograph was taken that might show human remains , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 prosecutor said saturday			1
the picture has renewed interest in the nearly 5 - year - old @entity12 case			1
officials first heard of the picture , taken in october by a vacationing @entity16 couple , on thursday , @entity17 , a spokeswoman for @entity3 prosecutor @entity19 , said " we have received the picture , and the diving team of the @entity3 police will start doing preliminary work at the spot where we believe it was taken , " @entity17 told @entity0			1
she declined to identify the location , saying authorities want to avoid attracting onlookers during the search			2
the picture has raised the notion that , if it shows human remains , they could be those of @entity35 , an 18 - year - old @entity37 high school student whose 2005 disappearance while on a graduation trip to @entity3 was widely publicized			1
@entity35 was last reported seen leaving a bar in the capital of @entity42 on may 30			2
@entity0 could not independently verify the authenticity of the photo nor confirm whether it shows human remains			1
@entity35 's mother , @entity46 , declined to comment on the photo			1
the photo was taken by a @entity50 woman using a disposable film camera during the first stop on her @entity54 cruise			1
three months after snapping what she said she thought were pictures of colorful fish , @entity55 and her husband said they realized that one picture contained what they believe appear to be human remains			1
" when i looked at that photo , i said , ' by darn , that certainly does look like a skeleton , ' " @entity68 told @entity70 's " @entity69 " on friday			2
" you can see the skull			0
you can see where the eye sockets were			0
you can see where the chin was			0
" it 's lying flat on its back			0
and its arms are cradled around			0
you can almost see fingers			0
and then on the one sleeve it looks like some kind of maybe clothing that 's deteriorating			0
" the couple , who took the photo to police and the @entity87 , said it was taken near a shipwreck			1
the @entity87 said friday that it is investigating			0
" the photo has been made available to all elements of the @entity87 that are involved in this foreign police cooperation case , " @entity90 , assistant director of the @entity87 's office of public affairs , said in a statement			1
" investigative leads are being pursued and the effort is ongoing			0
" the main suspect in the @entity35 case , @entity99 , remains free			1
@entity99 has made alleged confession - like statements in tv interviews , one of which involves dumping @entity35 's body in the ocean after she suffered a seizure on the beach			1
@entity3 judges have ruled there is n't enough evidence to arrest him			2
whether the object in the photo is human remains is still up for debate			1
in underwater burials , it is typical for arms , legs and other extremities to be dispersed and for lighter bones to be carried away from heavier bones by fish , wildlife and water , according to @entity129 , a forensic anthropologist			2
" it looks as if there 's something that may be on top of the skeleton , " @entity129 said of the image in the photograph			0
" that would certainly bode well for preserving the center of the mass of the body and keeping most of it there			0
" dr. @entity143 , a physician who serves on the faculty at @entity145 and @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity148 , said he sees mixed signs , some indicating the image may not be a skeleton			0
" what i do n't like about the photo is there 's no spinal cord or vertebral column , " he said			2
" in fact , below this roundish skull - type profile you see a curvature which does n't really represent a normal spinal column			0
" @entity0 's @entity162 and @entity163 contributed to this report .			0
