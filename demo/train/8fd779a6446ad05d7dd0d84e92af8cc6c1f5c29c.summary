-- each summer , more than 50,000 people pour into a cobblestone square in @entity3 for a gut - wrenching 90 - seconds			0
that 's all it takes for the flamboyantly dressed jockeys of @entity8 's legendary horse race -- @entity9 -- to race bareback around the medieval square			1
it 's been called the " most dangerous horse race in the world " -- about as far away as you can get from the genteel green lawns of @entity15 's @entity14 or the multimillion prize money bestowed on @entity18 's @entity17			1
now as the dust settles on this year 's colorful @entity9 , @entity0 takes a look at five weird and wonderful horse festivals from across the world			1
@entity9 , @entity8 on two days each year , the pretty town of @entity26 in northern @entity3 is transformed into an elaborate medieval race track , with 10 riders careering around the iconic city square three times			1
dating back to the 17th century , each rider represents their local neighborhood , competing not just for the coveted victory banner -- but good luck for the coming year			2
@entity35 , @entity36 fire and horses may seem like an unlikely combination , but that 's exactly the dramatic scene which takes place in a small town in central @entity36 each year			1
horse are ridden over blazing tree branches as part of the @entity46 in @entity47 , in an effort to purify and protect the animals			2
the controversial tradition , which has been criticized by animal welfare groups , dates back 500 years and is held on the eve of @entity53			0
watch : from camel racing to prized jockey @entity56 , @entity57 from fiery @entity36 to snowy @entity57 -- there 's not a bonfire in sight at the glitzy @entity56 racing carnival , held on the frozen @entity62			1
the remarkable competition includes skijoring , where horses thunder around the icy track while their riders hold on for dear life to a harness at the back , trailing behind on skis			2
in such extreme weather -- around @entity73 -- fur coats are the order of the day for the champagne - sipping spectators who are perhaps better known for their luxury lifestyles than racing tips			0
@entity80 , @entity81 the glitz and glam of snow - capped @entity62 could n't be further from the spear - wielding horsemen of @entity81 's annual @entity80			0
the fierce festival -- held on the island of @entity88 -- sees two teams go head - to - head on elaborately decorated horses , throwing blunt spears at each other as part of an ancient ritual battle			0
it is believed that every drop of blood spilled will bring a good harvest			0
@entity99 , @entity100 if you like your ancient festivals a little less violent , there 's the 1,000 - year - old @entity99 wild horse chase in central @entity100			1
the three - day festival sees samurai horsemen compete in different challenges -- from racing over a one kilometer track to battling over sacred flags			0
dressed in extravagant armor , helmets , and carrying swords , the fantastical warriors appear to have stepped straight out from the 10th century .			0

as the dust settles on @entity8 's @entity26 , @entity0 looks at wild horse festivals
includes fire *leaping* in @entity36 and samurai battles in @entity100
a world away from traditional races such as @entity14 or @entity17
