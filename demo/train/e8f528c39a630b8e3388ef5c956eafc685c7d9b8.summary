-- it was his most famous speech , and the most memorable moment of the march on @entity4			1
all eyes were on the rev. @entity6 on august 28 , 1963 , as he delivered his " @entity8 " speech to a crowd of 250,000			0
but one photographer , there to document the event , trained his camera away from the civil rights icon and toward the crowd			0
the result was a visual document showcasing the diversity of marchers who gathered that day			1
" this is the day : the march on @entity4 , " is a collection of 75 of @entity24 's photographs -- most published for the first time -- taken before , during and after the @entity26			1
@entity28 's most recognizable image is likely a photo of @entity6 glad - handing supporters in @entity31 after receiving the @entity32 in 1964			1
but in " this is the day , " there is only one photograph of @entity6 , an atmospheric shot taken from afar			2
most of the images focus on anonymous marchers : black , white ; union and nonunion ; secular , religious ; people from all over @entity42 , and from many different walks of life			1
" @entity24 's moving photography offers still images of an @entity42 at once frozen in time and marching restlessly to its multicultural and multiracial future through the lens of a visionary artist , " @entity45 writes in the foreword to the book			1
@entity24 was an @entity55 , born in @entity56 , who spent time in @entity58			0
he was living in @entity59 in 1961 when he took a photo of an unnamed @entity62 - @entity42 soldier standing guard by the @entity64			2
he was haunted by that image , according to @entity66 , a contributing author to " this is the day			2
" " ( to freed ) that encounter was a contradiction of @entity42 culture : that a soldier could guard a country 's freedom abroad , but would be denied those rights at home			0
" it compelled @entity24 to return to the @entity42 to photograph the story of race in @entity42			0
@entity24 's wife , @entity79 , recalled those images when she heard then - candidate @entity81 say : " i am here because somebody marched			2
" those words prompted her to revisit her husband 's archives from the march on @entity4			1
her husband died in 2006 , but she hoped his images of that day would live on			1
she worked with @entity66 , a visiting assistant professor of writing at @entity89 , to curate the project , and " this is the day : the @entity26 " was born			1
in this edited conversation , @entity0 spoke to @entity66 about @entity24 's photographs from the march and the importance of images in communicating the message of the civil rights movement			1
@entity0 : as a co-curator of the project , how did you and ms. @entity79 decide which images to select ? what criteria was used ? @entity66 : what we did was look ( at photographs ) that @entity24 had marked with a wax pencil , meaning this was an image he liked or would like to explore			2
we also sought images from the perspective of now , decades later , which images might stand out and be important to a contemporary viewer -- especially the ones that give us a view of the faces of the crowd			1
the goal was always that @entity24 's own vision might be brought out from the day , but also that other images might participate in a broadened cultural awareness of the sweeping diversity and impact of the march			1
@entity0 : what would you say is the most powerful image from this collection ? why ? @entity66 : one in particular that stands out is of young women in zip - up @entity133 jackets standing at the base of the @entity135 with @entity42 flags waving behind them			0
i think what you get a sense of is it took people out of their everyday circumstances and brought them together , here , against this monumental landscape of the @entity146			2
this was the people 's gathering place			2
and using their presence as a way to create a collective -- that stands out -- and states belonging			0
the photograph to me is a feeling of a belonging			0
@entity0 : @entity6 's " @entity8 " speech is perhaps the most enduring symbol of the march			0
what do the photos reveal that history often forgets ? @entity66 : one of the great historical facts about the march was the difficulty in pulling off an event that was pioneered by a number of organizations and individuals with different definitions and investments of social change at the march			0
( i see ) the rich diversity of the " we " : although there are different groups and investments , you get a sense from photographs like these that it 's not an " us " and a " them " but a " we "			0
it 's not to erase the differences , or simply streamline them , but in co-existing , you get a richer vision of what social change can be			0
@entity0 : how was this photography critical in the message of the march ? @entity66 : @entity24 captured some important private reflective movements			1
it 's a lesson for us in thinking about great moments in history : what it takes to envision progress or possibility is both about moving forward and also about considering and questioning and stopping -- and having the patience for social change			0
part of what photography gives us is ... a sense of the high points of these great moments in history , as well as the unexpected glances that really capture the subjects ( as ) they have their own thoughts and own ideas , ( and ) relate to the broader group 's perception throughout the day .			0
