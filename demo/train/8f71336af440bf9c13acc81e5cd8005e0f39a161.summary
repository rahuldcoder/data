-- they 're still massively undeveloped compared to their @entity3 neighbors , but @entity5 's islands are starting to get the attention they deserve			1
whether you 're looking for an all - night party or an underwater adventure among pristine coral reefs , @entity5 's got an island for all types and all budgets			1
here are seven of the best			0
best island for partying : @entity18 not too long ago @entity18 's only tourist amenities were a handful of bungalows besides miles of dense jungle and gorgeous white sand beaches			1
there 's still amazing hiking and trekking on the island in the parts of the jungle that loggers have n't destroyed , but in the last few years dozens of cheap accommodations have been built and the place has become a backpacker @entity32			1
though @entity18 remains surprisingly undeveloped , at least by @entity3 island standards , its business owners are notoriously party - friendly , bringing in generators to keep the music going until the wee hours and offering live djs and free - beer happy hours			1
a 24 - hour bar and a permissive attitude towards ganja have made the island a go - to spot for sun burnt travelers who want to bake on the beach by day and get toasted by night			2
getting there : high - speed ferries run from @entity51 ( @entity5 , @entity52 , @entity51 , +855 34 934 744 ) , which takes 50 minutes from shore and costs $ 15 return			1
in terms of accommodation , @entity55 ( +855 15 662 437 , kohrongvagabonds@gmail.com ) caters to the party set while @entity59 ( +855 81 830 991 ) and @entity60 ( +855 92 548 883 ) are a quieter option			2
best island for relaxing : @entity63 @entity63 has long been a favorite of expats in @entity66 , who head to the quiet island for weekends at @entity69 , once the only accommodation option here			1
more recently , a dozen new places have sprung up on the opposite side of the island , @entity75 -- a heart - shaped inlet with calm turquoise surf and beautiful beaches			1
fortunately the new businesses are determined to avoid the mistakes made on some of the neighboring islands and are promoting low - impact , sustainable tourism			2
the result is clean white sand beaches that visitors can have nearly all to themselves			2
there 's not much to do on the island , but that 's the point			1
days can be spent paddle - boarding , snorkeling or relaxing under a palm tree with a good book			0
getting there : from @entity51 , many of the @entity5 ferries to @entity18 also stop at @entity63 for $ 20 return			1
accommodation options include @entity99 ( +855 92 548 883 ) , @entity100 ( +855 16 997 047 ) and @entity69 ( +855 016 214 211 )			0
more : 12 stylish boutique hotels in @entity5 best island for luxury : @entity104 the nickname of these two small private islands means " sweethearts " in @entity108			1
fitting , as you 'd have to be pretty sweet on someone to take them there , with villa prices topping $ 3,000 per night			0
the 27 - room resort offers @entity5 's most exclusive island experience , starting with the bottle of champagne awaiting you at check - in			1
the champagne 's included in the price and so is just about everything else , from the transfers from shore and the gourmet meals made from locally - sourced foods to the well - stocked mini-bar and free international calls from your villa			2
even better , @entity104 is a model for sustainable development in @entity5			1
the resort is helping the local community develop education and waste management programs and has embarked on several conservation efforts , including a marine reserve covering 50,000 square meters around the islands			2
getting there : there are twice - daily speedboats to @entity104 ( +855 236 860 360 ) from the @entity51 port that are free for guests , or private boats can be organized for $ 660 or helicopter for $ 1,320			0
best island for nature watching : @entity149 located inside @entity150 , @entity149 is home to monkeys , civets , lizards , more than 100 different species of birds and several threatened species , including the fishing cat , a wetland feline than makes its home near streams and mangrove forests			2
the island has only one place to stay , @entity165 , and the term " resort " is used loosely : it 's little more than nine simple wooden bungalows , but it 's eco-friendly and solar powered			1
guests can hike , bird watch , snorkel or take the two - person sea kayak out for a spin			0
the resort is even raising ponies that children can ride			0
there are nearby deserted beaches to visit with occasional views of dolphins swimming along the coast			0

best island for meeting the green fairy : @entity189 the secluded beaches of @entity189 are probably the last place you 'd expect to find an absinthe bar , let alone a distillery			1
yet this is where you 'll find @entity197 , a one - man operation that makes five types of hand - crafted , small - batch absinthe			2
visitors can take a distillery tour that covers the entire process , from the wormwood that gives absinthe its reputed psychoactive properties to fermentation and bottling , plus the history of the oft - forbidden beverage			1
tours end with a tasting that 's served the traditional way , with a live flame , caramelized sugar and cold water			0
it 's possible to visit the island just for the afternoon , but the gorgeous beaches also demand a couple of days ' attention , as does the coconut bowling			1
those who want to stay overnight can lodge in one of @entity225 's tree - top bungalows next to the distillery , but it 's best to book in advance			1
getting there : @entity197 will be offering a daily boat , @entity231 , to the island specifically for tours the coming high season			0
( @entity197 , +855 97 569 7614 ) currently , there is a daily boat to @entity225 ( +855 88 5044192 ) from @entity51 for $ 6.50 each way , or private day boats can be booked at local travel agencies , including @entity240 ( +855 15 678 924 )			0
best island for diving : @entity243 located about five hours from the mainland , @entity243 was the site of a 1975 clash between @entity248 forces and the @entity249 , the last official battle of the @entity251			0
it 's now uninhabited save for a small outpost of @entity255 military personnel , resulting in clear coastal waters with excellent visibility and undisturbed marine life , making it and nearby @entity261 the perfect islands for diving			1
the island 's eight popular diving sites offer coral reefs and a wealth of underwater creatures , including fantastically colored nudibranches , poisonous pufferfish and dazzling stingrays with electric blue spots			1
getting there : overnight diving trips can be booked to @entity243 from @entity51 with @entity274 ( +855 34 933 700 ) or @entity275 ( +855 34 933 664 )			0
best island for unplugging : @entity277 @entity277 is the island of choice for those who want to totally disconnect from their regular life and do some serious beachcombing			0
the stunning island has just one place to stay , @entity286 , which has only five bungalows			0
visitors will be forced to take a much - needed break from email because there 's no internet on @entity293			0
but because the bungalows are solar powered they do n't have any noisy generators , either			0
showers use saved rainwater , produce is grown in the permaculture garden and there 's not much on the agenda other than lying in a hammock , enjoying the view and banishing all thought of life at home			0
