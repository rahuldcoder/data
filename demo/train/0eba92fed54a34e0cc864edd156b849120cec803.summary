-- @entity1 is a crazy place			1
in recent years we 've discovered some of the strangest things on the @entity1 : ice spiders , swiss cheese terrain , and perfectly spiral - shaped lava tubes			2
and the more we explore our near planetary neighbor , the weirder the things we find get			0
@entity12 's @entity11 , which has been circling @entity1 since 2006 , provides the clearest and highest - resolution images of the planet 's surface			1
looking through the image archive of its @entity18 camera , which can resolve things about a meter wide on the ground , reveals a vast supply of strange and wonderful things			0
here we share some of the orbiter 's most recent weird sightings from the last few months			0
the images provide incredible scientific insights into @entity1			1
but , perhaps just as important , they are beautiful , fascinating , and reflective of the alien world that sits not too far from our own			0
just a note on the colors in these images : @entity18 has cameras that see in slightly different wavelengths than our own eyes			0
many of the photos it produces are in " false color , " meaning the different wavelengths have been assigned colors for purposes of clarity or to highlight an important feature			1
there are no actual turquoise dunes on @entity1			2
but the false color pictures do allow scientists to differentiate various textures and materials on @entity1			1
