scientists have found what they 're describing as a " lost world " on the northern tip of @entity4 , @entity5 , hosting at least three previously undocumented species , including a frog that makes love in the rain			1
the discovered species , which also include a leaf - tail gecko and a golden skink , have been isolated in a remote mountain range on @entity14 for millions of years , according to @entity15			1
the joint expedition between the university and @entity18 in march led @entity15 's @entity19 and @entity21 researcher @entity20 , a @entity18 photographer , to the rugged range in northeast @entity5 's @entity23 , where millions of black granite boulders as big as houses and cars are piled hundreds of meters high			1
scientists have previously surveyed the base of the cape mountains , but the hot , dry , boulder - strewn rainforest on the plateau atop them is largely unexplored			1
a helicopter took @entity19 , @entity20 and a @entity18 film crew to the uplands			0
" finding three new , obviously distinct vertebrates would be surprising enough in somewhere poorly explored like @entity39 , let alone in @entity5 , a country we think we 've explored pretty well , " @entity19 said in a statement from the university			2
441 new species found in @entity42 the scientists found a " host of other interesting species " that may also be new to science , but the three vertebrates , which are described as highly distinct , will be documented in this month 's issue of @entity50 , a peer - reviewed journal for animal taxonomists			1
@entity19 said the highlight of the expedition was the @entity55 , a " primitive - looking " lizard that is considered a relic from the days when the rainforest was more widespread in @entity5			1
it can grow up to 20 centimeters ( almost 8 inches ) long			0
the gecko is a night hunter and hides in the boulders during the day			2
at night , the highly camouflaged critter sits motionless , head down , awaiting passing insects and spiders on rocks and in trees			0
its big eyes and long , slender body and limbs are likely " adaptations to life in the dimly lit boulder fields , " the release said			0
@entity19 , who said he knew it was a new species as soon as he saw it , named it @entity55 , meaning exceptional or exquisite , in reference to its distinct appearance			1
" the @entity55 is the strangest new species to come across my desk in 26 years working as a professional herpetologist			1
i doubt that another new reptile of this size and distinctiveness will be found in a hurry , if ever again , in @entity5 , " said @entity85 , curator of reptiles and frogs at @entity88			0
the @entity93 is also a lanky fellow , but unlike its gecko neighbor , it can be found hunting during the day , hopping across mossy boulders in search of insects			0
it has a golden hue and is isolated to the plateau rainforest			2
it has been dubbed @entity93			0
@entity104 means leaping , according to the university 's news release			0
also discovered was the @entity108 , which is found only in the boulder field at @entity23			1
its species name , @entity108 , means rock - loving			2
" during the dry season the frog lives deep down in the labyrinth of the boulder field where conditions are cool and moist			2
in the summer wet season the frog emerges on the surface rocks to feed and breed in the rain , " the news release says , adding that the frog only comes to the surface when it 's raining			0
there are no nearby bodies of water , so the frog reproduces by laying its eggs in the moist rock cracks			0
the tadpoles develop within the eggs , which the male frog guards until the froglets hatch			0
" these species are restricted to the upland rainforest and boulder fields of @entity23			1
they 've been isolated there for millennia , evolving into distinct species in their unique rocky environment , " @entity19 said			2
given the discoveries , there will likely be more expeditions -- and more secrets uncovered -- on @entity23 in the future			2
" the top of @entity23 is a lost world			1
finding these new species up there is the discovery of a lifetime , " @entity19 said			1
" i 'm still amazed and buzzing from it			0
" follow @entity153 on @entity154 : @ @entity155			0

scientists say the three new species have been isolated in forest for millions of years
discovered species include leaf - tail gecko , golden skink and a boulder - dwelling frog
herpetologist : @entity55 is " strangest new species to come across my desk in 26 years "
finding species in " lost world " of @entity23 is " discovery of a lifetime , " scientist says
