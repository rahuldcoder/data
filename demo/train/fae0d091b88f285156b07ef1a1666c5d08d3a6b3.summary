-- " it was the only race that frightened me , actually , " motorsport legend @entity0 says of @entity5 's historic endurance rally -- the @entity6			1
" it certainly was one of the races throughout the year where i thought , ' oh @entity10 , ' because i did n't know where i was going			0
" translated as the " @entity11 , " the race was held on public roads			2
competitors set off from @entity14 and blazed a trail south to @entity16 , before turning around and returning to the northern city			1
the rally was a true test of speed , courage and navigation			2
the @entity6 's origins date back to the early days of motorsport and the decision to move the @entity26 from @entity14 to @entity27 , near @entity28			1
the switch proved unpopular in @entity14 , and when an automobile club was formed in the city in 1927 , they sought to put on a racing spectacle of their own			1
the rest , as they say , is history			0
for 30 years between 1927 and 1957 , competitors -- including @entity0 and five - time formula one world champion @entity39 -- pushed their vehicles to the limit in an attempt to reach the finish line			1
it has since been resurrected as a serene , grand touring event , but in its racing years the prospect of driving at breakneck speeds down everyday roads was both a trial and a thrill for participants			1
@entity0 says it made for a nerve - shredding ride			1
" imagine going up a large incline towards a village and going at 185 mph without knowing which way the road goes , " the 82 - year - old told @entity1 ahead of this week 's 2012 edition			1
" if there is a turn over the brow , you need to know about			0
" in 1955 , ably assisted by co-pilot @entity68 , the @entity67 driver loosened @entity5 's stranglehold on the race , sealing one of only three @entity6 victories by a foreigner in record - breaking fashion			1
@entity0 , one of the best drivers never to win the @entity77 world title , set an average speed record for the route , clocking a time of 10 hours seven minutes and 48 seconds			1
but when asked about one of the highlights of his 14 - year racing career , @entity0 ' response was surprising			1
" i did n't know i 'd won , " he explained			0
" all i knew is that i was the leader at the stop before			0
" i did n't know i 'd won until my time had been split and i knew i could n't be passed , so it was a terrible anticlimax			0
i was very much on tenterhooks waiting			0
it was anticlimactic but nonetheless very exhilarating			0
" but when compared to all the races staged throughout motorsport history , including the 66 @entity77 grands prix @entity0 started , what set the @entity6 apart ? " the whole of @entity5 turns out , it 's absolutely staggering , " he said			1
" all across the whole country , people come out and line the roads			0
it 's amazing , more than five millions spectators			0
it 's something that could happen nowhere else but @entity5			1
" the one thing you must remember is we were genuinely doing speeds of 185 mph , on ordinary roads			0
there were no autostrasses or dual carriageways			0
and the amount of cars you have to pass , hundreds of cars , it 's pretty daunting			0
" ultimately , it was the element of danger which proved the race 's downfall			2
in addition to glorious victory , the @entity6 's legacy is also littered with fatal crashes			1
the most infamous was in 1957 in the village of @entity120 , a tragedy which proved to be the final nail in the race 's coffin			1
@entity127 driver @entity126 's @entity125 veered off the road and tore through a group of spectators , killing the driver , his co-pilot and nine bystanders , five of which were children			2
" a lot of the drivers -- you had hairdressers , you had chefs -- really were n't competent enough to drive at the speeds you had to drive at , " recalls @entity0			2
" in the modern day , one could not take the death toll			0
as the years passed , people dying in motorsport like that became unacceptable			0
" the 2012 edition began on thursday , with @entity0 in attendance to take part in the festivities			2
despite no longer being a rip - roaring , high - speed chase , the fabled tour still draws a big crowd			2
" it 's absolutely terrific , " said @entity0 after this year 's event had got underway			1
" the enthusiasm of the people here ... the @entity158 line the streets , pat you on the head , it 's just great			2
" people bring their own cars , if they 're fast cars , and go around			0
it 's something very special			0
" reflecting on the @entity6 as it was 60 years ago , @entity0 believes it had a certain spark which modern day motorsport has n't quite rekindled			1
" when the race car was just an ordinary road car , a bit faster of course , that was terribly exciting , " he said			2
" i 'm sure it is today , but i 'm not sure it would be quite as exciting as it was then			0

the @entity6 was an @entity158 road race between 1927 and 1957
@entity0 clocked the fastest average speed for the *1,000* - mile event in 1955
the race was dash from @entity14 , in @entity5 , to @entity16 and back again
a fatal crash ended the race in 1957 , but it survives today as a touring event
