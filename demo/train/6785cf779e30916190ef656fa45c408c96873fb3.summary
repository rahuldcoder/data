@entity0 -- @entity0 is set to become the latest state to open the door for medical marijuana , with gov. @entity5 to take executive action to let select hospitals dispense it to select patients , according to two advocates briefed on the plan			1
state assemblyman @entity11 , who has been a leading proponent of more comprehensive legislation for medical marijuana in @entity0 , said he learned about the executive action in a conversation saturday afternoon with members of the governor 's staff			1
it paves the way for a " limited and cumbersome program , " but nonetheless is a step forward on the issue , according to @entity11			2
" i 'm thrilled that the governor has taken this action , " the assemblyman said			2
" this is a very key interim step			0
" news of the governor 's initiative was first reported by @entity31			0
@entity5 's office did not respond saturday to @entity1 's requests for comment on the matter			2
medical marijuana is hardly unprecedented in the @entity37			1
twenty states and the @entity39 now allow it in some form -- among them @entity42 , where as of january 1 it 's legal to sell marijuana to those 21 or older -- according to info compiled by the @entity48			1
( in addition , @entity49 has a limited program for research			0
) the momentum has picked up of late , with most of these efforts taking effect over the past decade			0
the states where there is medical marijuana include @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , each of which border @entity0			1
and yet the @entity63 has not joined them			0
versions of the @entity66 pushed by @entity11 have passed the @entity67 , only to stall in the @entity68			0
@entity5 is acting without the legislature 's ok , though what he 's doing is legal , according to @entity11 , whose district includes much of @entity72			2
he explained that the governor is acting on powers granted through a law passed in 1980 in setting the stage for a highly regulated system that 's less liberal than many other medical marijuana setups nationwide			1
here 's how it would work , according to @entity11 : under @entity5 's directive , the state health department would take charge by setting up the guidelines and picking hospitals that would take part			1
these hospitals would then have panels of people who decide , on a person - by - person basis , which patients qualify for medical marijuana			1
it has yet to be determined where the medical marijuana -- or the elements of it that might be dispensed -- will come from , including who might produce it			1
@entity11 estimated that tens of thousands of people could get medical marijuana by virtue of this policy change , though he insisted it is no substitute for a more complete , far - reaching program			1
" ( @entity5 ) can take ( this step ) without the need for further legislation , " the @entity72 legislator said			2
" but to have a truly comprehensive and well - working system will take legislation			2
" @entity108 -- the @entity0 state director for the @entity109 , which describes itself as a " national advocacy leader of drug law reform " -- agrees , saying that it too will push for broader medical marijuana laws in the state			1
he learned about this latest measure in a call saturday from the governor 's office , saying the proposal originated there and describing it the same basic way as @entity11			0
even as he pushes for something bigger , @entity108 praised the governor for taking what he called an " exciting " initial step			0
" it 's tremendous , " @entity108 said			0
" we applaud him coming out on this			0
it 's going to help us build momentum to build a permanent program			0
" @entity1 's @entity133 reported from @entity0 , and @entity1 's @entity134 reported and wrote from @entity135 .			0

gov. @entity5 is set to act on medical marijuana , advocates briefed on his plan say
he *'ll* take executive action to set up a system where hospitals can distribute pot
advocates are excited about the plan , but say comprehensive legislation still needed
20 states -- including @entity61 , @entity60 , @entity59 -- allow medical marijuana
