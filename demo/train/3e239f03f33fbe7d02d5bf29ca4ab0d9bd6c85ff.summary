@entity0 -- a federal judge has blocked @entity0 from acquiring footage produced by documentary filmmaker @entity4 about a 1989 rape case concerning five wrongfully convicted men			1
@entity8 magistrate judge @entity7 ruled tuesday that the city had not shown enough reason to trump press freedoms when it requested interviews and unreleased footage from the @entity4 ' film " the @entity14			1
" the men have since been exonerated			1
the city had asked for the footage as part of an attempt to defend itself against a decade - long , multimillion - dollar federal lawsuit the men have since filed in the racially charged case			1
lawyers for @entity0 filed a subpoena demanding that @entity4 and his production company , @entity25 , give them the unpublished interviews and unreleased footage not used in the documentary , which premiered at the @entity28 in 2012			1
" while journalistic privilege under the law is very important , we firmly believe it did not apply here			0
it is our view that we should be able to view the complete interviews , not just those portions that the filmmakers chose to include , " city attorney @entity31 said			2
@entity4 , his daughter , @entity37 , her husband @entity38 , who co-wrote and produced the film , along with their production company , fought the subpoena primarily on the ground that the city 's argument was not strong enough to trump reporter 's privilege codified in the @entity0 @entity48 , which protects journalists and their sources			2
in a statement , @entity4 said , " @entity38 , @entity37 and i are grateful for this important decision ; we feel the judge made exactly the right ruling			0
we are also mindful that this ruling goes far beyond our current situation ; this adds a layer of important protection to journalists and filmmakers everywhere			0
" on april 19 , 1989 , a 28 - year - old white @entity62 investment banker was jogging through @entity63 when she was brutally assaulted , raped and left for dead			1
that same night a group of black and @entity66 boys had been in the park , throwing rocks at cars			0
in the ensuing months , the investigation lead to the arrest of five of the boys -- @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 -- who were later charged and convicted			0
in 2002 , three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms , one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when @entity72 , a serial rapist and murderer , confessed to the crime and said he had acted alone			2
dna analysis later determined that @entity88 did rape the jogger and that hair evidence used in the boys ' trials did not match .			0
