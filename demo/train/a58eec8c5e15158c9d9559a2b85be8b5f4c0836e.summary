deprived of water and food			1
shackled to a bed with a " four - point restraint for almost a month			1
" @entity5 sgt. @entity4 says that 's what life was like for him in his first weeks in a @entity10 prison			1
he ended up there after unwittingly crossing the border from @entity13 two months ago with several guns in his car -- firearms he says legally owns , but that it 's unlawful to bring into @entity10			1
@entity4 told @entity18 on friday that things have gotten better for him			2
he gets by on phone calls to his family , his faith , reading , exercise , sleep and -- perhaps above all -- hope			0
" i think that they will see that i 'm not guilty of the crime they 've ( accused ) me of doing , " he said			0
" they 'll just let me go			0
" yet there 's no guarantee that will happen			0
after a judge started and then quickly suspended a hearing wednesday after @entity4 fired his attorneys , a @entity10 judicial source said his next court hearing will be june 4			1
but his mother , @entity38 , said the next hearing is still weeks away , as it will take time for the new attorney to be briefed			0
until then , at least , @entity4 's days are going " by pretty slow			0
" but at least he 's not being -- as he puts it -- " abused " any more , something he credits in part to the attention his case has gotten in the media and among politicians			1
" since i got media coverage , and people i guess realized that i 'm not dangerous , " @entity4 said , " it 's been pretty relaxed and not so bad -- after the first month			1
" prison authorities denied the abuse allegations and said he is being treated well			2
' i got here accidentally ; please let me turn around ' it was march 31			1
@entity4 had walked across the border into @entity57 to patronize an establishment popular with @entity5 from @entity59 , his mother , @entity61 , said			1
as @entity4 explained , out of a parking lot , " i just made one wrong turn , and then that one wrong turn that i thought was going to take me north to @entity64 was actually an on - ramp that swooped around back to the south and to @entity10			1
" at one point , he got " funneled " across the border			2
" there was no way out of that except for if i had turned my truck around and drove into oncoming traffic , " @entity4 said			0
" that would have been the only way that i could have done it			0
" according to @entity38 , her son immediately disclosed to the border guards that he had weapons and requested that he be allowed to turn around , she said			2
" the first thing he said to the first person that stopped him was , ' i got here accidentally ; please let me turn around			2
i have three guns in my truck , ' " his mother said			2
a 911 tape released by @entity90 rep. @entity89 , @entity13 , appears to support his version of events			0
in it , the @entity5 is heard saying , " i crossed the border by accident , and i have three guns in my truck , and they 're trying to take my guns from me			1
" after learning he 's in @entity10 , the 911 dispatcher responds : " there 's nothing i can help you with then , sir			1
you 're not on @entity90 soil anymore			0
" @entity4 asks whether authorities have a right to take his guns			2
the dispatcher tells him he should have seen large warning signs on the freeway saying it 's illegal to enter @entity10 with guns			1
" there are warning signs that do say that as you 're driving down the freeway , before you enter @entity10 , " she says			1
" yeah , i was hoping there would be a turnaround point , " he says , " but there never was			0
" friend : @entity5 already suffers from ptsd what happened , at a state penitentiary called @entity125 , left his mother " mortified			1
" in addition to being punched in the stomach and slapped in the face , @entity4 said he was at times " naked ... overnight in the cold " and " shackled in a way that made me want to stand overnight			1
" he added : " i was not allowed to drink water for about maybe 12 hours , and i was not given food for a certain amount of time like half a day or so			0
" while @entity18 could not independently verify these claims with @entity10 authorities , if true , they would be the latest ordeal for a man who a close friend says was having trouble with post-traumatic stress disorder even before he was detained in @entity10			1
" his ptsd started from combat			0
now , he 's got a whole other load of @entity122 that he is going to get when he gets out of jail , " said @entity146 , who served with @entity4 in @entity147 in 2010			0
@entity4 has been able to speak with his friend when he calls @entity146 's house collect from the @entity10 jail			1
the two have talked about 10 times , @entity146 said			0
@entity146 said he 's astonished that a @entity5 -- or anyone -- could be treated the way his friend describes			1
" being tied to a bed in four - point restraints and joint manipulation restraints -- like ways that a pow would be treated ... it 's just ridiculous , " @entity146 said			0
" i do n't think it 's right for any @entity90 to be in a @entity10 jail treated like that			1
they are our neighboring ally , and it 's inhumane			0
" ' a different guy ' @entity146 had urged @entity4 to move from @entity172 to @entity64 so that he could help him seek treatment for ptsd			0
" as soon as he got out here , i realized that the @entity4 that i used to know has gone , " @entity146 said			0
" he became a different guy			0
" @entity146 and his wife noticed his friend was acting distant			0
" i took him to @entity178 , he got diagnosed and he started seeing people on a regular basis , " @entity146 said			2
not long afterward , he said , @entity4 made the wrong turn at an exit close to the @entity10 border			1
he had all his belongings , including his guns , with him , @entity146 said			2
" it was n't just his guns that he crossed with , " he said			1
" it was everything he had			0
