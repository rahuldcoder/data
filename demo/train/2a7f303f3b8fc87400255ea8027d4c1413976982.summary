-- @entity1 spent more than $ 2,000 recently to attend a friend 's wedding in @entity4 with her boyfriend			1
the weekend before , she was in @entity6 , @entity7 , celebrating nuptials , and the weekend after was spent feting another couple 's marriage on @entity11 , @entity12			1
and @entity1 is just getting started			1
she 's got four more weddings to go before mid-december			1
@entity1 , a business development manager for an it staffing company in @entity15 , receives only 10 days of vacation			1
weddings are lovely , one of the few occasions when people still get dressed up , tuck their gadgets away and observe longstanding traditions			1
but my , can traveling to a wedding get expensive			1
and the preceding engagement , bachelor and bachelorette parties and showers will slash into your savings too , should you choose to run that gantlet			2
the ensuing baby showers and family reunions may lump on another travel expense for our increasingly mobile society			1
these obligations are eating up vacation days and discretionary ( and not - so discretionary ) income , but it 's often nearly impossible to say no. and there are very good , fabric - of - our - society reasons for that			1
still , what is a mere mortal to do in the face of seven weddings ? " all my extra money goes to this , " said @entity1 , 30			1
" every weekend is a blast , do n't get me wrong			2
" photos : celebrity wedding sites she 's already hit a bachelorette weekend in @entity55 and plans on a beach getaway for another bride in @entity58 , but she ran out of vacation days and ca n't go on a cruise with another close friend and bride - to - be			1
next year does n't look nearly as busy for @entity63 on the event front , and she wo n't be taking her weekends for granted			2
" i think i 'm going to take a trip for me next year			2
" her situation is not unusual			2
forty - one percent of @entity69 adults use the majority of their vacation budgets on obligation trips such as weddings , holiday gatherings and reunions , according to a july @entity77 survey			1
the average cost to attend a wedding as a guest is $ 339 this year , down from $ 490 a year ago , according to the @entity81 and @entity82			2
if you 're in the wedding , the average cost this year is $ 377 , down from $ 539 in 2011			2
a far - flung destination wedding can easily set you back double that amount			2
@entity1 has politely declined invitations before , just sending a gift , but all seven of this year 's events are weddings she would n't want to miss. lasting connections : love at the airport sociologist @entity95 sees spending freely to celebrate big milestones as evidence of what people value			1
" on the one hand , doing these rituals is a way of showing that you 're not a materialistic person and that you value your close friendships , " said @entity95 , a sociology professor and founder and co-director of the @entity102 at @entity103			1
" at the same time , we do live in the economic world			2
" weighing finances is prudent , but so is weighing your relationships			1
turning someone down for a life - changing event can be damaging			2
" i think that is a kind of test , " @entity95 said			2
" if you invite somebody and they do n't come , then they 're not willing to put their money where their mouth is			2
they 're not showing that they actually care about you			2
" but caring for a friend to the tune of $ 1,000 can be a tall order			2
@entity134 , 27 , was faced with a choice : spend nearly $ 1,000 on a close friend 's bachelorette weekend in @entity138 or pay for her medical board exams			1
" for me , my career is more important than a weekend getaway , " said the medical resident who lives in @entity141			2
" the most important thing for me is to attend the main event : the wedding			0
" and attend , she will			0
she 's going to five in the next year : one in the @entity149 , one in @entity58 , one in @entity150 and two close to home in the @entity141 area			0
make or break ? travel tests your love life she estimates that she and her husband will spend $ 4,000 on the @entity149 getaway alone , which they plan to turn into a vacation since they will already have traveled more than a thousand miles from home			1
@entity134 has a few weeks left in her residency before starting a fellowship			0
her husband is also a resident , and the couple is shouldering hefty student loans			0
" it 's a definite financial burden to me and to him , " she said			0
but she feels like she ca n't say no to these events , and the stretch is worth it for their really good friends			0
" these people were there for me for my wedding , and i would feel terrible saying no , because they were there for me , " @entity134 said			0
and the budget ? " we kind of threw that out the window			0
" there are right ways to say no , says @entity183 , co-author of the 18th edition of " @entity185 " and great - great granddaughter of the grande dame of gracious behavior			0
" if you know right now , in the middle of june , that you are not going to go ... however you come to your choice , once you make it , make it early and tell people right away , " @entity189 advised			0
" it does n't count when it comes to etiquette if you did n't tell anybody			0
" you do n't have to share a reason , but if you do , be honest about it			0
it 's no good saying you ca n't afford a destination event and then heading to @entity205 two weeks later			0
in that case , say that you 've made other vacation plans or that you 've committed to something else , @entity189 says			1
do n't say yes and reverse your decision later			0
it 's better to thank someone for an invitation and wait to reply when you 're sure			0
@entity189 did say that turning someone down for a major milestone " can be very statement - making			0
" she calls weddings , christenings , funerals and other important moments " precedent - setting events			1
" " it 's much easier to carry on a relationship with someone , even if it 's a rough relationship , if you participate in the big events , " @entity183 said			0
joining friends and family has n't always been such a big production			0
the crossing of states and continents to be part of social rituals has picked up over the past 30 years as more people earn college degrees and participate in a national labor market , according to @entity95			1
more americans leave home , go to college and never look back , so friends and family are scattered			0
saying no to traveling across the country for special occasions seems to be getting harder			1
people used to accept the idea that an event might just be too far away , @entity95 says			0
" now there 's an expectation that there 's no excuse , " especially within the continental @entity69			1
cheaper and more accessible air travel , more affordable telephone service and the emergence of virtual communication have all given rise to people coming together more readily from long distances to mark milestones with their peers , @entity95 says			0
people ages 18 to 30 are especially likely to ignore the barriers of physical distance , because they 're used to the virtual closeness of daily communication with their friends on social media			1
and the most important ties are sustained through rituals			1
" it 's kind of the opposite of the uncertainty that we all have in our society			1
i mean , we 're all uncertain about our jobs , about our children , about success , about relationships -- whether we 're married or not , " @entity95 said			1
" ritual is reassuring and connecting			0
" connecting or not , there 's still nothing that says you have to attend			0
" anybody that feels they have to succumb to social pressure , whatever it is ... they need to realize the importance of listening to your inner self and developing your inner self , " said @entity286 , a sociologist and director of the @entity288 at the @entity289			1
" it 's not automatic that the community has the right of way			0
" part of what complicates matters and creates that to - go - or - not - to - go tension is the fact that the social norms that existed before the sexual revolution and the civil rights movement were upended in the late ' 60s			1
since then , everyone 's been coming up with their own rules and trying to create unique , distinctive events to celebrate their lives , says @entity286 , who edited the book " we are what we celebrate : @entity319			0
" weddings used to be " a ceremony , a reception , dinner			1
" now , some are three - day events			0
so many situations today require deliberation and negotiation and often lead to misunderstanding			0
" in the olden days , if you went on a date , there was no question , the boy paid			0
now , it 's complicated , " @entity286 said			0
" nothing is etched in stone anymore			0
