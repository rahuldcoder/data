-- despite the rise of the @entity6 and its freewheeling second - by - second ferment , government efforts at control and censorship remain rife across the @entity8 and @entity9 , a new report said thursday			1
" in the @entity8 and @entity9 , the @entity10 has offered many people access to information and the outside world that would have been unimaginable a few years ago , " according to the @entity15 's latest report : the @entity16 on the @entity8 and @entity9			1
" however , government control of the media remains tight in almost all [ @entity8 and @entity9 ] countries , and censorship and self - censorship are prevalent throughout the region			1
" the @entity10 has emerged as a challenge to officialdom and its pronouncements and reaction from activists			1
journalists say government efforts to stem the flow of information are futile			1
communication on the popular social media sites , where people are attempting to elude the strictures of their governments , is playing a cat - and - mouse game with widespread independent reporting in places like @entity40 and @entity41			1
but , said @entity42 , managing editor of the @entity43 based in @entity44 , @entity45 , " overall , things are getting worse			0
" in @entity40 , authorities cracked down on journalists after protests surfaced when president @entity50 was declared the winner in the june 12 presidential election , a victory that many in @entity40 say was fixed			2
" dozens of journalists have been detained without trial , and several sentenced to long prison sentences , " the report said			1
" as demonstrators took to the streets , a news blackout was imposed on the foreign media			1
and yet , through social media networks like @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , news of a violent government crackdown seeped out			1
" with the rise of the @entity10 , censorship efforts have emerged in @entity40 and other places across the region			1
@entity40 " also cracked down on online media following the disputed june elections , and arrested online activists in an effort to stop the spread of dissenting information and opinions , " according to the report			1
@entity41 , for example , uses a law designed to combat terror for arresting and detaining bloggers			0
but @entity86 , general manager of the tv network @entity87 , said the resistance to the flood of internet information from government and other sectors of society is like trying to stop the @entity94 from flowing			0
they ca n't halt it			0
" a lot of information is getting through to the average person , in @entity100 , in @entity101 and @entity102			0
censorship will not stop the free flow of information , in my opinion , " he said			0
@entity108 said the business needs of the telecommunications companies , the integral role the @entity10 plays in business , and the demand from citizens ca n't be thwarted			1
he said there might be remote regions where censorship can work because there is n't access to the internet in such places			0
@entity122 , @entity0 senior editor for the @entity8 who monitors social media sites , said young people are boldly circumventing the official media censorship across the @entity8 with @entity67 , @entity65 and alternatives			1
" people are taking matters into their own hands , " @entity127 said			0
" traditional media is not necessarily a driving force			2
" @entity133 , translator at the @entity134 in @entity100 , @entity41 , said governments want the @entity137 world to use the internet for fun and not interfere with government and serious issues , but people are circumventing the officials with new media			1
" we 're trying to express ourselves and expose the lies , " she said			0
people from different countries prefer different kinds of new media , she said			2
as for @entity40 , who are gearing up for a day of protests thursday against the regime on the @entity153 's anniversary , she said @entity40 prefer @entity67 because it ca n't be blocked and " is faster than blogs in conveying messages for masses			2
" @entity157 , vice president of the @entity159 - based observatory for the @entity160 and editor at @entity162 , said that theoretically , the whole world is getting its information online , but in the @entity8 , censorship remains a reality , with cyberpolice blocking sites or even , as in the case of @entity170 , the internet itself			0
there is a dynamic in the @entity8 between censorship and self - censorship			0
" when journalists sit down to write a piece , they have to keep in mind the reaction to what they 're writing			2
they 're either scared of sanctions or revenge			0
" @entity186 's foreign minister @entity185 said the @entity10 " has revolutionized the world " and " has helped foster creativity , innovation and freedom			1
" there have been complaints there about the recent blocking of web sites in @entity186			2
while @entity185 said regulating different kinds of censorship internationally is impractical , he said in the @entity8 , censorship takes forms he has mixed feelings about			0
" censorship can be taken too far to silence dissent and opposing views , but it can also be used as a tool to prevent potentially destructive and damaging ideas and behavior			2
there is increasing concern about harmful content on the internet from violence , inciting racial hatred and terrorist activity , to sexual content and pornography , which justifies censorship on moral grounds , " @entity185 said			0
as for other aspects of the @entity8 and its media , the report reveals several relative silver linings when it comes to press freedom : the environment in @entity225 , @entity226 and the @entity227			1
@entity225 has a " far and more diverse and vibrant media than any other @entity137 country , " but the institute found that " most of @entity225 's media outlets are unduly influenced in their journalism content by powerful political figures to whom they are financially and politically beholden			1
" @entity237 said the media in @entity225 can be characterized as " partly free " because there 's a lot they do n't talk about , such as criticism of military intelligence and the head of state , for example			1
according to the report , " @entity226 has one of the most open media environments in the @entity8 " for @entity226 journalists with a wide range of opinions and commentary			1
at the same time , @entity226 security policy prevents @entity226 journalists from traveling into the @entity256 territories without special permission , and @entity256 journalists are prevented from entering @entity226			0
the report said both @entity226 soldiers and @entity256 security forces interfere with the work of @entity256 journalists , and that journalists in @entity264 have to resort to self - censorship			1
freedom of speech and press in the @entity227 gets " some of the highest marks in the @entity137 world , " but it " still has a long way to go			0
" the report cited a " number of taboo topics that journalists in the @entity227 are not supposed to touch and indeed , most of the media do not , " such as criticism of the ruling family			1
across the @entity8 , criticism of royal families and words perceived as insults to @entity283 have been criminalized			0
in @entity286 , violence there has dropped and so has the number of journalists ' deaths , but " the @entity293 military continues to imprison journalists without charge " and local security forces have been responsible for beating journalists			0
there is concern about the rise of proposed legislation stifling media freedom			2
in @entity170 , which has " one of the world 's worst records on media freedom , " the media outlets are owned or controlled by the government			2
political unrest elsewhere , the report said , is accompanied by media crackdowns , such as in @entity310 , where there has been an insurgency in the north and civil unrest in the south			2
elections in @entity317 and @entity318 have also led to press freedom violations			0
governments have controlled " moral content " as well , the report said			2
" in @entity327 , several people involved in the production of a television show about sexual attitudes were sentenced to flogging and jail terms			0
in @entity330 , journalist @entity329 was sentenced to a flogging for wearing trousers			0
following international uproar , the punishment was reduced to a fine , which was then paid by a pro-government journalists ' association			0

@entity15 's latest report notes rise of web as news tool
governments seek to control news , sometimes by jailing journalists , report says
news still gets out via @entity10 , social media , despite governments ' efforts
