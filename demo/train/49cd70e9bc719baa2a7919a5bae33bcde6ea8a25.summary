-- the man once known as @entity4 's " prince of pot " is now a federal inmate in the @entity6 system after a judge in @entity8 sentenced him friday to five years in prison			1
marijuana activist @entity10 pleaded guilty in may in @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity8 , to a single count of conspiracy to manufacture marijuana after an 18 - month investigation into the seed - selling business @entity10 operated from his head shop in @entity19 , @entity20			1
by imposing the five - year sentence , which includes four years of supervised probation , @entity6 district judge @entity21 honored a plea deal that @entity10 , 52 , entered into with @entity6 authorities to avoid a lengthier sentence			1
" there is no question your actions were illegal and criminal and your actions ensured that others broke the law and suffered the consequences , " the judge told @entity10 during the hearing			0
dozens of @entity10 's supporters gathered outside @entity12 's federal courthouse to protest the sentence , which marks the end of a five - year legal battle against a man once described by @entity6 authorities as one of its most wanted international drug trafficking targets -- and the only one from @entity4			1
@entity10 is the founder of the @entity48 and the website @entity50			0
his status in @entity4 as a tireless advocate for marijuana legalization has been cemented through years of sit - ins , demonstrations and runs for political office			0
by his own account , he has been arrested at least a dozen times since 1995 related to his activism , and @entity19 police have raided his shop several times since it opened in 1994			0
in his plea agreement , @entity10 admitted to operating a marijuana seed selling business with two co-defendants , who entered pleas this year to lesser offenses and were placed on probation in @entity4			1
he also admitted to selling seeds to customers in the @entity6 through mail and telephone orders and in his @entity19 retail store			1
" @entity10 decided that @entity6 laws did not apply to him , but he was wrong , " said @entity6 attorney @entity75 in a statement friday			2
" @entity10 put his personal profits above the law			0
he made millions of dollars by shipping millions of seeds into the @entity6 he sold to anyone who would pay him -- with no regard for the age or criminal activities of his customers			2
now , @entity10 is paying the price for being part of the illegal drug trade that damages lives , homes and the environment			0
" but @entity10 and his supporters worldwide have maintained from the start that his prosecution was politically motivated , citing a 2005 @entity96 press release touting his arrest as a " significant blow " to the marijuana legalization movement			1
" hundreds of thousands of dollars of @entity10 's illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the @entity6 and @entity4			1
drug legalization lobbyists have one less pot of money to rely on , " former @entity96 administrator @entity102 said in the july 2005 statement , which can no longer be found on the @entity96 's website			0
@entity108 : @entity10 's wife speaks @entity10 's lawyer reminded the judge of the press release in his presentencing memorandum , claiming there are other seed selling businesses in @entity4 that the @entity6 government chose not to go after			1
" the only thing that makes mr. @entity10 unique or different from most of these other seed sellers is that @entity10 donated his proceeds to help fund lawful marijuana legalization efforts throughout the @entity6 and @entity4			1
on this record , no one can ( or should ) take the government seriously when it claims that this case was not politically motivated , " @entity121 wrote			2
but the @entity125 said that @entity10 's personal politics had nothing to do with his prosecution			2
" through the years , and in various contexts , @entity10 has meant different things to many people			0
but in the context of this federal criminal prosecution , @entity10 stands before the court as many others have before him -- as an admitted drug dealer who has entered a plea of guilty to a large scale marijuana trafficking conspiracy , " the @entity6 attorney 's office wrote in its presentencing memo			1
" the government 's case was investigated and prosecuted without regard for @entity10 's personal politics , his political agenda or the ways in which he chose to spend the proceeds of his drug crimes			2
" with @entity10 in prison , his wife , @entity151 , has become the face behind their cause , which has not fallen dormant in his absence			0
rallies to support @entity10 and the legalization movement will be held in more than 70 cities across the globe on september 18 , she said			0
" it 's going to be a long , difficult road ahead , but we 'll be able to make it with all the support we have , " she said			0
@entity10 also remains firm in his beliefs , though in a letter to the court , he admitted his means may have been self - defeating			2
" it was my sincere belief that the prohibitions on cannabis are hurtful to @entity6 and @entity4 citizens and are contrary to the @entity6 and @entity4 constitutions			0
i was , however , overzealous and reckless in pursuing this belief , and acted arrogantly in violation of @entity6 federal law			0
i regret not choosing other methods -- legal ones -- to achieve my goals of peaceful political reform			1
