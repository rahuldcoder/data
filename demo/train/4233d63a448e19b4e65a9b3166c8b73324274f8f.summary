-- thinking about @entity4 president @entity3 ' efforts this week to gain observer status as a nonmember state , i 'm reminded of one of my favorite " @entity9 " episodes			1
sitting in the restaurant -- the venue for so many of the best " @entity9 " bits -- @entity13 and @entity14 conspire to produce a new sitcom , a show literally about nothing			0
not surprisingly , the idea comes to nothing as well , though the ironic brilliance that the very show they want to produce already exists adds a cool philosophical edge to the comedy			0
sadly , like the " @entity9 " episode , the @entity4 effort to gain entry into the @entity28 as an observer state will come to nothing as well , even if -- as is likely -- he succeeds			1
and that 's the real tragedy			0
success will neither provide the gains @entity35 hope to achieve nor the disasters that opponents of the initiative predict			0
in the end , @entity3 and the @entity35 will be no closer to statehood and perhaps even a little further away			1
motives frustrated by the world 's seeming indifference to the @entity4 issue and weakened by his inability to deliver anything , @entity3 is desperate for an end - of - the - year success of some kind			1
blocked by @entity49 and the @entity50 last year from gaining admission as a state , he 's fallen back on the idea of observer status , an initiative that ca n't be vetoed by the @entity56 and is likely to succeed in the @entity28			1
opinion : why @entity56 , @entity58 should welcome @entity4 move at @entity28 observer status is largely a symbolic issue , but the @entity4 might then have access to other @entity28 - affiliated agencies , including the @entity64 , assuming that body would be willing to entertain @entity4 claims and charges against @entity58			1
indeed , @entity4 desperation is accompanied by a @entity4 assessment that the international arena offers a fertile field to score political points and to pressure and isolate the @entity58			2
call it a kind of global station identification for an organization -- @entity78 -- that 's run out of options			0
what matters is what happens on the ground if the history of this issue shows anything , it demonstrates that what really counts is what happens between @entity58 and @entity35 in the region			1
how sad and ironic that it was @entity92 ' rockets , not @entity3 ' diplomacy , that put the @entity4 issue on the map again			2
and that 's likely to be the story again -- whether through violence or diplomacy			0
what counts is whether @entity58 and @entity35 can offer incentives and disincentives to one another in currency that matters -- prisoners , land , cease - fires , economic assistance , etc. it matters not a whit what goes on in @entity111 at the @entity112			2
@entity3 might well be the best partner @entity58 will ever have , but if he ca n't deliver or if the government of prime minister @entity116 does n't want to deal with him , well @entity114 , we have a problem			1
and at the moment , it is @entity92 -- not @entity3 -- that counts more and the @entity123 / @entity122 arena , not the @entity28 , that 's more relevant			2
@entity49 's calculations why not support the @entity3 move ? does n't the @entity56 have a stake in bucking him up and reinforcing the two - state solution ? @entity130 's calculations in opposing the observer initiative are three			1
first , philosophically , ever since we 've had @entity58 - @entity4 negotiations , the @entity56 talking points have been pretty consistent			2
what matters is negotiations , not moves , at the @entity28 and even though there are no talks now , the @entity56 position is correct ; the only thing that can produce two states are two -- maybe three -- parties talking			0
second , there 's no doubt that @entity130 understands that observer status will only deepen the adversarial relationship between @entity3 and @entity116 , give the @entity58 another reason not to negotiate and get the president into a fight with @entity151 should he support the @entity4 bid			1
indeed , that 's the last thing he needs at a time when he 's wrangling with @entity151 about the fiscal cliff and fighting with the @entity157 about @entity158 , the @entity56 ambassador to the @entity112			0
finally , if he is going to consider an initiative on the big @entity58 - @entity4 issues during his second term , he needs to build up credibility with the @entity58 -- as he 's done on the cease - fire in @entity123 -- so he can be in a better position to push and persuade them later			2
news : palestinians again take status case to @entity28 an initiative about nothing the observer state initiative wo n't make the difference that either its advocates or detractors imagine			1
@entity151 might further restrict aid to the @entity35 at a time when the @entity4 is in the red			0
@entity3 will look feckless -- and @entity92 even stronger -- because in the end , the results in @entity111 will change nothing on the ground for the better in the region			0
indeed , @entity58 might well retaliate by withholding tax revenues it collects for the @entity4 under agreements reached in the mid- 1990s			0
and sadly , unlike a " @entity9 " episode , what happens between @entity58 and @entity35 actually matters			1
for the time being , these two peoples will remain suspended between a peace they can not have and a confrontation neither wants but might well come nonetheless			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

@entity4 president @entity3 seeking nonmember state status at @entity28
former diplomat @entity198 says the move is like a " @entity9 " episode , a show about nothing
he says it wo n't achieve a *breakthrough* and also wo n't likely do much harm
@entity194 : the real story is about what happens on the ground between @entity58 , @entity35
