-- @entity1 , june 8 , arrives this year at a time when people are especially focused on the safety of waters threatened by the @entity7 oil disaster			1
yet it is also a time when more people are committing to work to preserve the oceans than ever before			1
among them is @entity13 , who last week completed the third and final leg of her effort to row across the @entity16			1
@entity13 was one of dozens who took part in the @entity21 cruise in april , organized by the nonprofit group @entity22 to develop a strategy to save the oceans			1
in her talk on the @entity21 cruise , taped before the final leg of her @entity16 journey , @entity13 estimated that her trip across that ocean required more than 8,000 miles of rowing , spending 312 days on her own in a 23 - foot rowboat			1
@entity13 is the first woman to row solo across the @entity16 , from the @entity34 of the @entity35 to @entity36			1
( @entity37 rowed a shorter route from @entity39 to @entity40 in 2005			2
) learn more about the " @entity41 " once a management consultant based in @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity13 says she knew from day one that the career was n't right for her			1
but she did n't get serious about making a change until she was in her mid- 30s			0
" i sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary , the one that i wanted , a life of adventure , and the one that i was actually heading for which was a nice , normal , pleasant life , but it was n't where i wanted to be by the end of my life			1
" watch a revealing look at the oceans ' glory and shame she wound up competing in the @entity63 rowing race , from the @entity64 to @entity65 , a 3,000 - mile run			1
" sure , i had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone , but what i 'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is , by definition , extremely uncomfortable			0
and my timing was not great either -- 2005 , when i did the @entity63 , was the year of @entity73			1
there were more tropical storms in the @entity63 than ever before , since records began			1
and pretty early on those storms started making their presence known			0
" all four of her oars broke before she reached the halfway mark -- and @entity13 was forced to improvise using a boat hook and other equipment on the boat			1
the @entity41 was a product of undersea explorer @entity93 's 2009 @entity92 wish " to ignite public support for a global network of @entity96 , hope spots large enough ... to restore the blue heart of the planet			1
" the @entity98 cruise attracted leading scientists and celebrities such as @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , and @entity106 -- and resulted in $ 15 million in pledges to protect the seas and advocate for new policies			0
in her talk making the wish , @entity110 pointed out that in the past 50 years , 90 percent of the big fish in the oceans have been consumed and nearly half of the ocean 's coral reefs have disappeared			2
less than 1 percent of the ocean is protected from destructive fishing , and @entity110 believes the seas will go into irreversible decline unless a much larger portion -- some experts say as much as 30 percent -- is protected			0
@entity110 said the world needs to act swiftly to protect what she calls " the blue heart of the planet that basically keeps us alive			0
" a filmmaker explains how he became fascinated with sea creatures in @entity13 's view , the environmental problems the world faces do n't result from the big incidents such as the @entity136 or the @entity7 oil disaster			1
" mostly it 's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals day after day and year after year			1
and , by the same token , we can turn that tide			0
we can start making better , wiser , more sustainable decisions			2
and when we do that , we 're not just one person			0
anything that we do spreads ripples			0
" other people will see , if you 're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag			2
maybe if we all start doing this , we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the check - out line			2
that 's just one example			0
" watch other talks from @entity21 @entity13 's first effort to cross the @entity16 ended in failure in 2007 when her boat capsized three times in 24 hours and she was rescued -- against her wishes			1
the next year , she completed the first leg , to @entity167 , but only after nearly running out of water			1
she managed to meet up with the crew of the " @entity170 , " a boat made mostly of plastic water bottles that @entity13 said was built to call attention to " the @entity16 garbage patch , that area in the @entity16 about twice the size of @entity177 , with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it , circulating at the center of that @entity181			1
" earlier on that voyage , @entity13 said , the crew had caught a mahi mahi and found that its stomach was full of plastic			1
@entity13 wrote this post for @entity0 after her @entity16 journey was completed : in the couple of months since this @entity22 was recorded , i have rowed 2,000 miles from @entity192 to @entity36 in the third and final stage of my @entity16 crossing , becoming the first woman to row solo all the way across the @entity16			1
during those two months the ocean has suffered new assaults -- notably the oil spill in the @entity7 , but also smaller insults , as i have witnessed with my own eyes			0
on a beautiful calm day , with sunlight glinting off the waves , it is heartbreaking to see a plastic bottle floating on the water			2
even thousands of miles from land , the ocean wilderness is no longer pristine			0
mankind 's impact is felt everywhere			0
when i have been alone for a long time at sea -- sometimes over a hundred days without seeing another human -- this evidence of our carelessness is especially jarring			0
there are times when i feel ashamed to be a human being , and feel obliged to apologize to the small community of fish that congregate beneath my boat for the mess we have made of their home			2
and it does n't impact just the fish			0
oceans cover 71 percent of the @entity230 , and are an integral part of our weather systems , climate control , and food supply			2
how can we have a healthy planet -- or healthy bodies -- if we do n't have healthy oceans ? i row across oceans to inspire people to take action on environmental issues			1
something the ocean has taught me is that any challenge , no matter how huge , can be tackled if you break it down into little steps			0
crossing the @entity16 has taken me about 2.5 million oar strokes			1
one stroke does n't get me very far , but you take all those tiny actions and you string them all together and you get across 8,000 miles of ocean			0
you can achieve almost anything , if you just take it one stroke at a time			0
and it 's the same with saving the oceans			2
on a day like @entity1 , when we feel part of a huge global community , it 's easy to believe we can change the world			2
but there will be other days when maybe we feel alone , and that anything we do as individuals wo n't really make a difference -- that it 's just a drop in the ocean			0
we all have it in our power to make a difference			0
in fact , we 're already making a difference -- it 's just up to us to decide if it 's a good one or a bad one			2
every time we say no to a plastic bag or refuse to drink bottled water , it matters			0
if i can row 8,000 miles to make a point about the state of our oceans , then you can do your part too			2
start by going to http://ecoheroes.me / and log a single green deed that you are going to do today , @entity285 , to help save our seas			0
we have a lot of work to do , but the longest journey starts with a single step -- or oarstroke .			0
