-- in @entity2 , a life - size wax house is melting			1
in the city 's busy @entity5 shopping piazza , a building floated above the ground			1
a 20 - minute walk away , a townhouse is flipped on its head			2
no , you 're not hallucinating			2
these are the most recent irreverent installations from @entity13 , the @entity14 artist making a name for himself with site - specific works that appeal to the imagination and beg for a photo - op. for the past year , he 's been achieving this through architecture			1
" architecture is the fabric and surroundings of our daily and habitual environments , " says @entity13 , 30			1
" it provides a very good canvas for creative exploration and abstraction			0
" an architectural chapter when i meet with @entity13 at his psychiatric ward - turned - apartment in @entity33 ( seriously ) , take my lighting , but do n't steal my thunder -- the polystyrene building floating above @entity5 -- has just been taken down after its three - week run			1
" it was on the national news in 24 countries that piece , and footfall was up 18 percent in respect to trade and the piazza			0
so that 's just great , " he says			0
the floating building is part of what @entity13 calls the " architectural chapter " of his career , which has born four large - scale installations that use the materials , language and shapes associated with the craft			1
though he 'd previously used construction materials to create small sculptures , he only recently started working on a larger scale , partly inspired by @entity63 's @entity62 ( a concrete mold of a @entity66 house that won the @entity67 in 1993 ) and the installations of @entity69			1
" it just made sense to integrate those creative explorations into an architectural context and scale , back to where they belonged			2
" making the familiar strange what makes @entity13 's work distinctive -- other than its obvious mind - bending properties -- is how each one seems both at home and out of place in its surrounding neighborhood			1
a @entity86 for 50p , built in @entity87 as part of @entity89 , would look like a typical @entity91 house were it not made of wax and melting a little more each day			1
the floating building looks like a part of the 184 - year - old market has just been plucked and suspended in mid air			1
" i do n't like to disrupt a district too much , so the work is contextually sensitive			0
the material and visual decisions are informed by the district and the area and the architectural language of that region , " he explains			0
" the concepts are extremely considered despite their playfulness and simplicity			0
they 're tailored to their environment and their audience			0
" his installation in @entity5 , for example , needed to speak to the piazza 's high levels or foot traffic and tourists to please the commissioning landlords			1
" the demographic through the piazza is incredibly eclectic , but it 's very fast - paced and recreational			2
people come and go , take a photo and move on , so the artwork had to deliver an impact for the @entity129 generation			0
" this last phrase seems to sum up his installations well			2
the pieces are difficult to execute , simple to enjoy and , he insists , free of any particular meaning or concept			2
the priority is public enjoyment			0
conceptually light , sculpturally complex the response to the floating house , as well as his other works , has been overwhelmingly positive			1
along with comments on - site , @entity13 says he regularly receives emails , tweets and links to articles from people who have enjoyed his installations			1
the owner of a vintage shop near from the @entity152 of my nose to the belly of my toes , his sliding house in the seaside town of @entity159 , even gifted him a free suit because of the number of shoppers his installation attracted			2
though he tries to avoid the usual traps -- internet comment sections , namely -- @entity166 still receives his share of negative criticism too			0
he 's grown immune to accusations that his work is pointless , a waste of taxpayers ' money , or , alternately , a waste of private commissioners ' money , but he 's still occasionally frustrated by the assumption that his work is easy or banal because of its simplicity and lack of intellectual intent			0
" i do n't understand at what point the experience needed this intellectual justification to be an important and valuable one , " he says			0
" i 'm often criticized for this lack of conceptual content			0
but what we lose in conceptual content we make up for in structural and sculptural complexity			0
" ( to wit : the floating house took eight months to realize , and had over 100 people involved from design to construction , the melting house -- which was commissioned , designed and constructed concurrently -- required about 75 people to take care of wax fabrication , carpentry , steelwork , painting and brick - laying			1
) " with art , and i think really a lot of public art , you create it and then you have to abandon it a little bit , distance yourself from it , because it 's not really yours anymore , " he says			2
" there 's no safe place in the public eye			0
" creating a legacy with the melting house now a pile of hardened goo being scraped off a pebbled lot ( the installation finished sunday ) , and the floating building broken down and hauled away , @entity218 is focusing on the future			1
he 's currently investigating how to tie the @entity228 's distinctive chimney into a knot , and developing a windmill that has fallen from its base , causing the building to spin while the sails remain stuck in the ground , efforts he suspects could trump his past projects in size and ambition			2
" i 'm kind of bored by the last and excited by the next , which is a healthy attitude , " he says			0
" i think it encourages progress			0
" the greatest buildings you 'll never see : priceless monuments lost in conflict art works that mess with your sense of scale ' @entity253 gardens ' : when art , design and a whole load of plants collide the most spectacular buildings of 2014			1
