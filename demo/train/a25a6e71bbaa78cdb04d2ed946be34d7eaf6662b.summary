-- drug cartels , whether in @entity2 or @entity3 , can not function without massive assistance from compromised officials at all levels			1
corruption is the oxygen that keeps organized crime alive			0
i know something about corruption and organized crime			0
i spent more than six years in the biggest , richest syndicate in the history of crime -- the @entity18 cartel			1
and i know that @entity3 , like @entity2 , ca n't succeed against its drug gangs without choking off much of the bribery and intimidation that sustain them			1
first , some background : i used to be @entity24			1
i left my name in @entity2 when i entered the @entity27 witness protection program 16 years ago			1
i also left a home , a country , friends , family , even my past			0
but maybe my experience will help show the importance of fighting corruption as a way to fight the cartels			2
my primary job in the @entity18 cartel was security for one of four godfathers , @entity41 , the daily operations boss			1
others were more directly involved in routine bribery , but i still managed to deliver nearly a million dollars in payoffs			2
and i witnessed many , many millions more			2
the biggest bribe i ever handled personally was a half - million - dollar payoff to a @entity49 air force colonel			0
i was buying four @entity27 - made bombs -- 500 - pounders -- that the bosses wanted to drop on @entity53			0
it was a very bad idea , but they sent me anyway			0
the cash was disguised as a birthday present , about the size of a large shoebox , wrapped in red paper with gold trim			0
i 'd never seen so much money			2
i remember that it was surprisingly heavy			0
then there were the two checks signed by @entity66 about $ 50,000			2
as instructed , i took those to a bank near the @entity18 airport and deposited one into the account of a sister and the other to the mother of a captain in the @entity2 anti-narcotics task force			1
it was a bonus for the captain 's help getting the boss away from a police raid			2
in those days , hundreds of high - ranking and lower level police were on the cartel 's secret payroll -- tens of thousands of dollars paid every month for inside tips or for looking the other way			1
the youngest boss , @entity87 , sometimes liked to use local police as sentries at his home			0
the cartel had important friends in the military , too -- from helicopter pilots to generals			1
one well - placed insider was the sergeant and chief of staff to the military commander of the anti-narcotics task force			0
he cost $ 20,000 a month			1
between sources like the army sergeant , the police captain and others , my bosses and i were kept informed about dates , times and places for raids and such things as which cartel cars were being followed and what phone numbers were being tapped			1
on one occasion , we knew that @entity41 had time for lunch and a shower before the raiding party was scheduled to arrive			0
both the sergeant and the captain were among hundreds of police and military officers fired for corruption			2
besides law enforcement , the cartel bought a piece of @entity2 's justice system with payoffs to prosecutors who lost evidence , misplaced paperwork , blocked search warrants or released prisoners before they could be questioned			1
some judges became overnight millionaires			0
i see police and judicial corruption as the biggest price of organized crime			0
politicians were considered a long - term investment			0
it seemed sometimes that they all had their hands out			0
the bosses handed out $ 20,000 checks like hospitality gifts			1
i was there when campaign officials for a presidential candidate came for help			0
eventually , a total of $ 6 million in secret donations made @entity154 our president			0
after top campaign aides acknowledged receiving cartel funds , @entity154 insisted that if such contributions were made , it was without his knowledge			0
and i was there when @entity18 cartel lawyers were allowed to rewrite our national constitution to outlaw extraditions of @entity2 traffickers to the @entity27			1
you may be skeptical when i tell you , but no true @entity2 could have watched that spectacle of democracy for sale without suffering some heartache			2
when i agreed to assist @entity27 drug enforcement agents 16 years ago , the @entity18 cartel was making $ 7 billion a year			1
cartel documents turned over to @entity2 authorities exposed a vast network of corruption			1
widespread arrests and firings followed , and the grip of corruption was broken			0
that 's what brought down the @entity18 cartel , and it can make a difference in other countries where a culture of acceptance makes corruption especially stubborn			1
the @entity3 public needs to express its outrage			2
and , then , @entity3 leaders need to sweep out officials at all levels who have sold their souls to organized crime			2
how @entity2 is busting drug cartels join @entity201 on @entity202 and follow updates on @entity204 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity24			1

@entity24 worked for @entity18 drug cartel in @entity2 as security for a godfather
@entity24 paid off police , military , politicians , justices , prosecutors with millions in drug money
one military official got $ 20,000 a month for info , he says
@entity24 : @entity3 must stop the bribery and intimidation that keep cartels in business
