in 2010 alone , there were roughly 1,100 attacks on @entity3 fuel convoys			1
this has cost the men and women of our armed forces dearly			0
military officials recently reported that more than 3,000 uniformed soldiers and contractors died while protecting such missions in @entity13 from 2003 to 2007			1
but new @entity15 initiatives could dramatically reduce our battlefield fuel demand through the use of new clean energy technologies , helping save lives and stretch ever - scarce defense dollars			1
the @entity3 @entity15 is one of the world 's largest institutional energy consumers			1
using more than 300,000 barrels of oil daily , the @entity3 military consumes more petroleum products than three - quarters of the countries in the world			1
in fiscal year 2008 , energy cost the department about $ 17.9 billion			2
leaders in the @entity15 , though , are up to the challenge			2
the @entity15 played a key role in the development of the @entity36 , semiconductors and modern satellite - based navigation , used by virtually anyone with a smartphone			1
now , as detailed in a recent report by the @entity45 , its efforts to improve vehicle efficiency and use advanced biofuels could similarly lead the way for countless @entity3 businesses seeking a foothold in the burgeoning global clean energy economy			1
building on the work of an expert panel convened by the @entity52 , the @entity15 has called for a new technology development strategy aimed at reducing risk to soldiers and enhancing our nation 's overall long - term energy security			1
the department considers this one of its top strategic imperatives			0
in keeping with this plan , the military has set a target of obtaining 25 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2025 , with 450 renewable energy projects already functioning			1
for example , the @entity68 will soon test a hybrid electric drive system for the @entity71 , a guided missile destroyer , which will save 8,500 barrels of fuel annually			2
the @entity77 made history last year with the first flight of a biomass - powered aircraft , the @entity75 and the @entity76 has insulated roughly 9 million square feet of bases in @entity13 and @entity82 , reducing energy consumption by 77,000 gallons per day			1
with more than 500,000 buildings and structures at major installations around the world , the @entity15 manages three times the square footage operated by @entity89			1
since 1985 , it has reduced its facility energy consumption by more than 30 %			0
the @entity76 's " @entity92 " program offers another case in point			0
the project aims to have select installations each produce as much as they consume in energy , water or waste by 2020			0
@entity100 and @entity101 , to name just two , will become @entity92 in all three areas			0
combined , these efforts could have a huge impact on @entity3 operational security			2
on average , each deployed soldier requires 22 gallons of fuel per day			0
in fact , in @entity82 alone , tens of millions of gallons of fuel must be delivered each month			0
yet , according to the @entity76 , there is roughly one casualty for every 46 ground resupply convoys in @entity82			0
so reducing our reliance on oil could keep countless troops out of harm 's way			0
this @entity15 initiative could also act as a catalyst for our nation 's growing clean energy economy			1
according to @entity45 's report , the military 's sizable purchasing power could provide a crucial difference in helping technologies make the transition from the labs to the marketplace			0
in the process , badly needed jobs and manufacturing opportunities in the private sector also could be created across the nation			0
the past decade has presented great challenges to our armed forces			0
they have responded with creativity , tenacity and courage			0
the @entity15 has been charged with managing two wars , helping establish more robust homeland security measures and responding to worldwide humanitarian emergencies			2
throughout these trying times , however , the military also has looked inside its own operations and developed a sound strategy to enhance @entity3 's security and lessen our dependence on foreign fuels			1
@entity154 and the @entity155 should match that effort and aid this endeavor to save @entity3 lives , money and energy .			2

@entity162 : thousands of soldiers in @entity13 were *killed* protecting fuel convoys
@entity15 is one of biggest energy consumers in world , she writes
now , she says , military is playing key role in developing renewable energy sources
@entity176 : @entity15 biofuel initiatives could also help @entity3 businesses
