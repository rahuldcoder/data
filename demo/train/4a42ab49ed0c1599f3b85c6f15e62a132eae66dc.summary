the president of @entity1 moved wednesday to dismiss the school 's longtime band director in the wake of last weekend 's hazing - linked death of a drum major in the school 's famed marching band			1
" the reason for this intended employment action is based upon your alleged misconduct and / or incompetence involving confirmed reports and allegations of hazing with the @entity16 and the ' @entity20 , ' " president @entity17 said in a letter to @entity19			0
the letter , which was marked " confidential , " notified @entity19 that he was being dismissed effective december 22 and placed on administrative leave with pay effective immediately			1
the letter , which gave @entity19 10 days to respond to @entity17 , was provided to @entity23 by the university			1
@entity19 , who had led the 420 - member band since 1998 , did not return a call from @entity23			1
" wow , " said @entity28 , the mother of another band member who , she said , had also been hazed			1
she said she had mixed emotions about the dismissal			0
" i believe that he did the best that he could , " she told @entity23 in a telephone interview , adding that @entity19 had appeared sincere about trying to stop the hazing			0
" i think that it goes further than just him			0
he had people working under him that need to be held just as responsible			0
" but @entity40 , whose 18 - year - old son is a band member whom she did not want to identify by name for fear of retribution , praised @entity19			1
" any time i alerted him to an issue , dr. @entity19 was always responsive , " she told @entity23			0
she blamed section directors for setting the tone that allowed hazing to occur , despite @entity19 's efforts to halt it			1
" i do not think he had the support that he needed , " she said			0
@entity40 accused a section leader of having hit her son in the back when practices first began last summer , and said that was just the beginning			1
" i reported maybe four to five incidents , " she told @entity23			0
" they need to interview each member of the band , no matter how long it takes			1
this is not a witch hunt , this is about getting things under control			0
" her son loves band , she said			1
" but this year , freshman year , was not a fun year for him , " she said			0
wednesday 's dismissal comes four days after band members returned to their @entity75 hotel following saturday 's game			1
there , @entity81 , 26 , " reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe , " the sheriff 's office said in a release			1
champion was taken to a hospital , where he was pronounced dead			0
" the investigation indicates that hazing was involved in the events that occurred prior to the 911 call for assistance , " @entity85 sheriff @entity84 said tuesday			0
his death was not the first incident linked to hazing within the marching band , and school officials were well aware of the abuse , @entity28 said			1
" @entity99 , i warned them , " she said , adding that she had met with band officials at the @entity98 school after her son told her he too had been hazed			1
" i went to them and told them , ' @entity99 has blessed you with so much prestige and so much honor , and if you do n't do anything , it will take just one incident to bring your world down			1
' " @entity28 's 20 - year - old son , @entity111 , plays alto saxophone in the band and was among a number of musicians who were being maltreated , she said			1
" my son told me he was mentally and verbally hazed ; he was not physically beat , but that 's because he does n't allow that kind of thing			1
" my son always stood up for himself -- he would say , last year when he was a freshman , they were picking on another freshman 's sister and he had to stick up for her			1
these students are very disrespectful towards one another			0
" for some , the abuse went beyond verbal and psychological to include paddling , she said			1
@entity28 said she met with and e-mailed band staffers about her concerns over what she saw as pervasive hazing			2
" i addressed them to the leadership and they act like they do n't know -- they say if students do n't address it , then there 's nothing they can do			1
if students are n't willing to stand up and say there 's something going on , there 's no one they can prosecute			1
" @entity147 declined to speak to @entity23 , his mother said			2
" he 's just not ready to talk , " she said			2
" he 's just not ready to go to that next level yet			2
" she forwarded to @entity23 a copy of an e-mail she sent in august to @entity152 , dean of the @entity154 , and band director @entity19 , in which she described an incident one of her son 's classmates said he had seen			1
" he ... witnessed the same section leader ... choke the same student and held his neck up in this choking manner			0
this was done in a remote corner where he thought that he could not be seen by others			0
i could go on with horror stories , but i wo n't			2
students do not report these acts because they are in fear of being ostracized			0
" " i have spoken to dr. @entity19 on many occasions -- he listened and said it would be addressed , " @entity28 wrote			0
though band members must sign an anti-hazing agreement , the practice continues , @entity28 said			2
" it 's not the band staff that does it , it 's the section leaders , upperclassmen , the students that they 've chosen to be in leadership , " she said			1
calls to the school 's spokeswoman , @entity184 and to @entity152 were not immediately returned			1
on wednesday , gov. @entity186 sent a letter to @entity189 commissioner @entity188 asking the department to join the investigation " to assure that the circumstances leading to mr. @entity81 's death become fully known , and that if there are individuals directly or indirectly responsible for this death , they are appropriately brought to justice and held accountable			2
" authorities have not said what happened to @entity200			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity85 medical examiner 's office said wednesday that the autopsy had not been completed and that no cause of death was available			2
under @entity211 law , any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third - degree felony			0
after the incident , president @entity17 suspended band performances and said he will convoke a task force " to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the @entity20			2
" " the purpose of this review is not to establish culpability of individual band members in this particular case , but rather to determine whether there are patterns of behavior by the band -- or members of it -- that should be addressed at the institutional level , " he said			2
@entity17 acknowledged that at least 30 band members were let go this semester because of possible involvement in hazing			2
but that was n't enough , according to @entity28			2
" my prayer is there will be no cover - up , " she said			0
" they need to get the mess out of their band and start new			0
" she likened the hazing incidents to gang initiations and said they were carried out in secret			0
" not like street thugs , but here , if you want to be accepted , then you got to go through it			0
" @entity28 said the incidents were " like a generational curse that needs to be broken " and held out hope that @entity200 's death would result in the end of hazing			0
" someone has got to break the cycle , " she said			0
the @entity20 's motto lays out " qualities to live by , " including " highest quality of character " and " dedication to service			0
" in 2009 , the band represented @entity211 in the parade for president @entity267 's inauguration .			1

" @entity99 , i warned them , " mother of band member says
but band officials " act like they do n't know , " she adds
she says that son 's *harassment* was mental and verbal , that others were paddled
school officials did not immediately respond to calls
