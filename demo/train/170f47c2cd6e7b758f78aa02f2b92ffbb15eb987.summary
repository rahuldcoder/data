the 30 clubs were asked to vote on admitting the most successful club in their country to the @entity2 and in which division they should be placed			1

they were subsequently expelled from the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) and had to turn to the lesser @entity2 for next season			1
why @entity3 ' financial meltdown should worry @entity7 football at a news conference at @entity25 's @entity24 , it was announced that 25 of the 30 clubs had voted for @entity3 to start the 2012 - 13 season in the @entity27			1
" it has been a very , very important day for @entity31 football , " @entity2 chief executive @entity28 told a press conference			1
" we have voted to willingly accept @entity3 as an associate member of the @entity2 ( 29 out of 30 clubs in favor ) " the only acceptable position will be to place @entity3 into the @entity27 from that start of this season , 2012/13			1
this decision followed a tried and tested process " today 's decision has been one of the most difficult for all concerned but it has been taken in the best interest of sporting fairness , which is the fundamental principle of the @entity2			2
" but that decision is likely to have severe financial implications for @entity31 football , which has struggled to attract the cash lavished on the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) south of the border			2
as one of its two great clubs , part of the famous " @entity54 " with @entity25 rivals @entity55 , was facing up to years in the wilderness , the @entity48 sealed a sponsorship deal with @entity58 worth £ 40 million ( $ 62.18 million )			1
the three year deal is a near 50 per cent increase on the previous sums paid by @entity58 and follows a month after the @entity48 improved a 70 per cent increase in the value of its domestic television rights to more than £ 3 billion ( $ 4.67b ) over three years to 2016			0
by contrast , the sponsorship and television deals for @entity31 football are comparatively modest			0
a new five year television deal for the @entity18 , starting from the 2012 - 13 season , will bring in £ 80 million ( $ 124.5m )			2
@entity70 matches between @entity3 and @entity55 , who traditionally battle for the honors in the @entity18 , are the main attraction for @entity31 football fans and armchair viewers			1
reports have suggested that the new tv deal may even founder if a certain number of @entity54 matches can not be guaranteed			0
rangers have also been regulars in the @entity83 since its inception			0
they won the @entity86 in 1972 and as recently as 2008 were runners - up in the @entity88 ( now @entity88 )			0
@entity18 chief executive @entity89 and his @entity91 counterpart @entity90 both lobbied for @entity3 to be placed in the @entity2 @entity92 so they could secure a quick return to the top flight , but their pleas were ignored			1
@entity3 went into administration on february 14 this year following court action from @entity99 tax officials			0
businessman @entity100 purchased the assets of the club for £ 5.5 million ( $ 8.55m ) and they were transferred into a new company in june			0
several leading players have since left the 54 - time @entity31 champions , claiming their contracts were effectively annulled when the new company was founded			2
reacting to the @entity2 decision , @entity100 said : " we are grateful to be accepted as members of the @entity2 and accept their decision to vote us into @entity110			0
" this decision maintains the sporting integrity that clubs and fans across @entity31 have been calling for but it also impacts massively on @entity31 football as a whole and only time will tell what the consequences will be			2
