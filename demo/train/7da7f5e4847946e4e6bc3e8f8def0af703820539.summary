new light has been shed on one of the most famous serial killer cases in history			0
a lab test confirms dna evidence taken from the body of a murder victim matches @entity10 , who at one point confessed to being the @entity12 , @entity5 authorities said friday			1
the evidence was taken after @entity14 , 19 , was sexually assaulted and strangled to death on january 4 , 1964 , in her @entity17 apartment in @entity18			1
@entity10 had confessed to that crime and about a dozen other murders police attributed to the @entity12			1
however , he recanted his admissions and was never convicted of any of them before his death			2
although many continued to believe @entity10 was the @entity12 despite his retraction , others expressed doubts			1
now , however , there is an " unprecedented level of certainty " that @entity10 raped and killed @entity14 , @entity33 district attorney @entity32 said in a news release friday			1
officials announced the results after notifying @entity14 's family of the findings , the release said			2
see more : city of fear , photos from the @entity12 era " questions that @entity14 's family asked for almost 50 years have finally been answered			1
they , and the families of all homicide victims , should know that we will never stop working to find justice , accountability , and closure on their behalf , " @entity32 said			0
@entity18 police commissioner @entity54 credited " a relentless cold case squad " who " refused to give up , waiting until science met good police work to solve this case			0
" @entity10 was stabbed to death in 1973 while serving a life prison term for unrelated rapes			1
solving a murder with dna @entity32 said earlier this month that scientists had tried several times in the late 1990s and early 2000s to isolate dna evidence from semen found in @entity14 's body and on a blanket			1
they resumed their efforts last year , after scientific advances had led to a laboratory successfully salvaging dna from decades - old material			0
@entity78 technicians were able to extract dna profiles from both sets of samples , and those dna profiles matched one another , the news release says			0
the dna profile was uploaded to the @entity86 's @entity85			2
known as @entity85 , it stores the dna profiles of millions of known offenders , the release says			0
but there was no match			0
that ruled out at least one man who earlier been an unofficial suspect in @entity14 's slaying , it says			0
investigators then went on a search for any other evidence that might contain @entity10 's dna			1
but each place that might have had suitable samples -- like the @entity101 , the @entity102 and others -- did not			0
knowing y chromosomes are passed down " almost unchanged " from father to son , @entity78 retrieved a water bottle that one of @entity10 's nephews drank from and threw away			2
police revealed this action earlier in july			0
although the @entity64 recovered from the bottle was a " familial match " with the genetic material preserved from @entity14 's murder , @entity32 said at that time that it was n't enough to close the case with certainty			2
it did , however , lead to a judge approving @entity121 's exhumation so a dna sample could be taken directly from him			1
on july 12 , @entity10 's grave was excavated and his remains were transported to the @entity125			2
comparisons were made , officials said , and the match was confirmed .			0

officials : @entity131 's @entity64 matches evidence from a @entity12 killing
the victim was 19 when she was raped and murdered in her apartment in 1964
@entity10 had confessed , then recanted ; he died in 1973
his body was exhumed this month so a dna sample could be extracted
