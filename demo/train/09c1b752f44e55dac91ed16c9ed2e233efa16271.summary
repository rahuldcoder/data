-- as @entity4 president @entity3 stood in @entity5 on wednesday to propose deep cuts in @entity4 and @entity8 nuclear weapons arsenals , @entity2 war planners were working to make these weapons more accurate and deadly			1
the @entity10 told @entity11 this year it plans to put nuclear cruise missiles on board stealthy @entity15 bombers for the first time			2
currently , only the half - century - old @entity18 bombers carry these weapons			2
the @entity10 also plans to add a new and improved cruise missile to the mix. nuclear " gravity bombs " -- the ones that are designed to be dropped out of planes -- will be getting some help too			2
the @entity2 is moving ahead with plans to install sophisticated new tails that will improve their accuracy			2
can the @entity4 maintain its current level of nuclear security with fewer nuclear weapons -- if the weapons are more accurate ? related : @entity3 says let 's cut some nukes for nuclear weapons analyst @entity38 of the conservative @entity40 think tank , the answer is no. it 's all about targeting , she says			1
having fewer weapons allows fewer possible targets			2
according to @entity45 , having fewer weapons to reach the same or increased number of targets is bad			2
with lower numbers of nukes , the @entity4 wo n't have enough weapons to cover military targets in @entity8 , @entity51 and elsewhere , she says			1
as an alternative , war planners will be forced to consider shifting targets toward civilian populations			2
" that is just not a good idea , " she says , adding that it brings new ethical and moral choices into play			0
nuclear weapons : who has what ? @entity45 says the @entity4 needs to remain at current nuclear weapons levels to keep the playing field even			1
other nuclear powers , including @entity8 , have been increasing their arsenals , @entity45 says			1
as for @entity51 , @entity45 says the @entity2 does n't know exactly how many nuclear weapons @entity68 has , because " @entity51 has a very extensive tunnel network where they can build and store nuclear weapons			1
... we 're talking about thousands of miles of tunnels			0
" from a moral standpoint , improving nuclear platforms while proposing weapons cuts appears disingenous to some , including nuclear weapons analyst @entity79 of the @entity81			1
the @entity3 administration is using delivery systems to improve the military capability of the nation 's nuclear arsenal			1
he says that 's undercutting the spirit of the president 's promise to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in national strategy			1
as for wednesday 's proposed cuts , @entity79 welcomes @entity3 's proposal , but he says , " offloading 500 warheads from missiles will not destroy a single warhead , nor does it reduce the total arsenals of the @entity4 and @entity8 , who have 4,650 and 4,500 warheads , respectively , in their military stockpiles			1
" this ai n't your @entity106 strategizing , say experts			0
preventing the use of nuclear weapons nowadays is much more complicated than it was in the days when @entity112 and @entity113 kept things peaceful thanks to the idea of " mutually assured destruction			1
" the landscape is different			0
for example , the prickly relationship between @entity120 and @entity121 has a nuclear component			2
@entity124 now poses a huge nuclear question mark			0
one of the biggest fears for many world leaders involves terrorists getting their hands on a nuclear weapon			0
what has n't changed much is the horrifying damage these things leave behind after the mushroom cloud blows away			0
" only nuclear weapons produce radioactive fallout that can cause cancers , birth defects , and genetic damage for decades after they are used , " according to the @entity140			1
with the @entity106 in our rearview mirror , " it 's very unlikely we would get into a shooting war with @entity8 , " @entity79 says			1
" politically we 're moving away from that situation			0
but militarily the two countries are still holding on to these arsenals because they can see what the other country has			0
predominantly the @entity4 and the @entity8 have high numbers of weapons because we have high numbers of weapons			1
so there 's a sort of self - fulfilling prophesy in that			0
" so , why put nuclear cruise missiles on the @entity15 bomber ? experts say the @entity15 's radar - evading stealth design would more effectively penetrate hostile airspace than the larger , slower , less agile @entity18			2
the @entity18 has been toting nukes since the dawn of the @entity106			0
by the time it 's scheduled to retire in 2040 , its career will have stretched an incredible 80 years			0
experts fear that b - 52s can more easily be brought down by surface - to - air missiles			0
" you do n't want to fly @entity176 over anything but tribal militias these days , " @entity172 of the @entity173 told @entity174			0
" that 's a good way to lose b - 52s			0
" whatever the case , @entity4 is moving forward with a new generation of nuclear weapons			1
the current mainstay of @entity4 's nuclear cruise missiles -- the @entity186 -- is getting old			1
it was deployed in the 1980s			0
the @entity4 says it has about 1,100 of these atomic hammers			2
they measure about 20 feet long , weigh 3,100 pounds and boast a range of more than 1,500 miles			0
and they can blow through the sky at a speed of 550 mph			0
in 2007 , the @entity4 retired a stealthy @entity194 , as part of a @entity4 - @entity8 weapons reduction agreement , according to the @entity81			1
now , the @entity10 is developing another stealthy nuke cruiser , which it recently described in its 2014 proposed budget as " capable of surviving and penetrating advanced " air defense			0
by the mid- 2020s , if all goes according to the @entity10 plan , new generation nuclear cruise missiles will be deployed aboard a new @entity4 aircraft that -- for now -- is generically referred to as the @entity203			1
big changes are in the works on many levels across the nuclear weapons landscape			1
regardless of your point of view , it 's in everyone 's interest to pay attention .			0

@entity3 proposes *negotiated* nuclear weapons cuts with @entity8
the @entity4 is moving nuclear weapons to better platforms , increasing their accuracy
critic : better platforms undercut the spirit of @entity3 's promise to move away from nukes
cutting nukes will force targeting of civilians instead of military targets , says nuclear analyst
