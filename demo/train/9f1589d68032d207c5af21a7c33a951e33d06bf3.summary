@entity0 , @entity1 -- his compound in @entity0 has been overrun , rebels control the closest international airport and world leaders including president @entity8 are declaring his 42 - year rule over			1
one major question that remains unanswered is : where is @entity12 ? rebel fighters who searched the sprawling @entity14 in the @entity1 capital on tuesday found boxes of weapons and ammunition , but no @entity12			1
with the fighters of the @entity22 also in control of @entity0 's international airport , the options for an escape narrowed			1
@entity25 , who led the rebels in the takeover of the airport , said there had been fierce clashes there wednesday , and speculated that @entity12 loyalists were trying to " to secure a route for @entity12 to escape from @entity0			1
" he said he saw an official convoy after sunset tuesday , and said it was " possible " @entity12 was inside			2
" he does n't seem to have much control of anything , " @entity38 spokeswoman @entity37 told reporters tuesday			2
" it 's interesting that he still has n't been seen			2
" so where could @entity12 be ? professor @entity44 , a former @entity12 aide , on tuesday described to @entity2 a system of bunkers under the @entity12 compound in @entity0 that could serve as a hideout			1
however , @entity44 noted that @entity49 and the @entity50 have fired anti-bunker bombs at the compound , so he doubted @entity12 would hide out there			1
" you have to remember that he is a military man , " @entity44 said			2
" he knows they have weapons that could penetrate those bunkers			1
that 's why i 'm dismissing the idea that he 's still in there			0
" there has been speculation that tunnels might lead from @entity12 's now - overrun bunker to the @entity66 , where about 35 journalists are being held against their will by low - ranking @entity12 loyalists			0
but @entity2 's @entity70 , who is among the reporters trapped there , said journalists had scoured the hotel from top to bottom and seen no evidence of secret passages			0
@entity44 also noted that @entity12 's recent public communications , such as a statement broadcast on radio and a reported telephone call to @entity83 , were audio messages to avoid detection of his whereabouts			0
" the quality of the audio has deteriorated , and that 's an indication that he is speaking from a distance , " @entity44 said			0
" that 's why i am not really convinced that he is in the compound right now			1
" @entity50 officials called for @entity12 to make clear that , regardless of where he may be , he knows he 's out as the nation 's leader			1
the @entity50 wants @entity12 to issue " a reliable , affirmative statement " to the international community and his loyalists still fighting in @entity0 " that he understands ... his leadership is over , so everyone can move on , " @entity37 said			0
while no sightings of @entity12 have been reported , at least one source outside @entity1 -- the head of the @entity106 -- told @entity83 's @entity109 news agency that he spoke by telephone with him on tuesday			0
according to @entity111 , as reported by @entity109 , @entity12 said in the phone call to him at around 10 a.m. et that he is " alive and well in @entity0 and not going to leave @entity1			0
" a @entity50 official , speaking on condition of not being identified , said @entity12 is most likely still in @entity0			0
there has been nothing to confirm some reports or speculation that the longtime leader has gone to his hometown of @entity121 , the official said			1
observers cite three likely scenarios for @entity12 's immediate future -- his death at the hands of rebel forces , his capture , or his escape or exile to another country			1
@entity12 and his second - eldest son , @entity132 , are under indictment for alleged crimes against humanity by the @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138			0
officials at the @entity136 have made clear they want the @entity140 to stand trial in @entity137 , if possible			2
countries considered possible exile homes for @entity12 include @entity144 , a rumored destination for months			1
@entity12 and @entity144 president @entity146 have a close relationship forged in part by shared opposition to @entity50 influence around the globe			1
in 2009 , @entity146 was one of three world leaders to attend a lavish celebration of @entity12 's 40 years of rule in @entity0 , along with @entity155 of @entity156 and @entity157 of @entity158			0
that same year a new football stadium in the now rebel - held town of @entity162 was named after the @entity144 leader			1
on tuesday , @entity146 said his country would only recognize a @entity1 government led by @entity12 , state media reported			0
" from here we confirm our solidarity with the @entity1 people , our brother that is being assaulted and bombed ... as part of the imperial insanity , " @entity146 said during a meeting of government ministers in @entity172 , the state - run @entity168 news agency reported			0
@entity156 also is considered a possible exile destination , due to common interests between @entity12 and president @entity155 -- an interest in pan-african solidarity , a disdain for colonial influence and the ignominy of being largely shunned by the international community			1
@entity186 is considered a desert nation that might be more to @entity12 's @entity190 liking			2
the @entity186 accepted the deposed leader of @entity192 , @entity193 @entity191 , after the uprising there that helped touch off protests across the @entity197 and @entity198 , including @entity1 , this year			2
however , @entity12 's relationship with @entity186 has cooled since the @entity186 accused @entity1 of trying to kill their king several years ago , and it would be unlikely for the desert kingdom to accept an exiled @entity12 now , according to @entity203 , a @entity186 expert at the @entity204			0
other nations mentioned as possible destinations for @entity12 include @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209			0
@entity2 's @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
