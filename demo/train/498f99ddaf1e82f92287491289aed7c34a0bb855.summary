let 's get this out of the way straight off : the @entity3 is probably not going to top anyone 's list of @entity6			2
and the stories of its failures spread faster than a speeding jetliner : @entity3 officers stealing money from luggage , taking bribes from drug dealers , sleeping on the job			1
so it should n't come as any surprise that a new @entity20 report , citing a 26 % increase in misconduct among @entity3 employees between 2010 and 2012 , is striking a nerve with some travelers who 've had to endure the shoeless , beltless shuffle on the trip through security			1
" whenever you get an organization that has to be there , sometimes it just starts to take on a weight of its own , " traveler @entity29 said wednesday at @entity30			0
" so maybe it 's just not being managed			0
" " this makes me never want to check my bag , " @entity40 user @entity38 posted wednesday in response to the news			0
" that 's disgusting , " tweeted user @entity45			0
@entity20 report reveals increase in @entity3 employee misconduct among the report 's findings : -- misconduct cases involving @entity3 employees -- everything from being late to skipping crucial security protocols -- rose from 2,691 a year in 2010 to 3,408 in 2012			1
-- about a third of the cases involved being late or not reporting for work , the largest single category of offenses			2
-- 10 % of offenses involved inappropriate comments or abusive behavior			2
-- about a quarter involved screening and security failures -- including sleeping on the job -- or neglect of duty offenses that resulted in losses or careless inspections			0
photos : 20 odd items confiscated by the @entity3 examples of violations the report details one case of a @entity3 agent suspended for seven days after trying to carry a relative 's bag past security without screening			1
a supervisor interceded and the bag was found to contain " numerous prohibited items , " according to the @entity20 report			1
it did n't say what the items were			0
in another case , a @entity3 agent was suspended for 30 days after a closed - circuit camera caught the officer failing to individually examine x-ray images of passenger items , as required by agency policy			2
among the 9,622 offenses cataloged in the report , the @entity20 also found 384 ethics and integrity violations , 155 " appearance and hygiene " complaints and 56 cases of theft			1
while not specifically mentioned in the report , notable cases of theft by @entity3 agents include a 2012 case in which two former employees pleaded guilty to stealing $ 40,000 from a checked bag at @entity113 's @entity112 , and a 2011 guilty plea from an officer who admitted stealing between $ 10,000 and $ 30,000 from travelers at @entity117 in @entity118			1
the officer in the 2011 case , @entity119 , admitted he would " kick up " some of that money to a supervisor , who in turn allowed him to keep stealing			0
the supervisor , @entity124 , also pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks and bribes			0
airport officer claims he was fired for exposing sleeping guards taking it seriously overall , 47 % of the offenses detailed in the report resulted in a letter of reprimand , at least 17 % cost the employees their jobs and 31 % ended with a suspension			2
" if they 're stealing , they 're doing drugs or breaching the security system intentionally and i can prove it , they 're out , " @entity3 deputy administrator @entity137 told a joint hearing of two @entity139 subcommittees on wednesday			1
but he said , even the letters of reprimand handed out in nearly half of the cases are serious punishment			0
such letters can block employees from receiving a bonus or promotion , and stay with them their entire career , he told rep. @entity156 , @entity157 , chair of the @entity3 subcommittee			1
" it 's a serious thing , sir , " @entity159 said			0
he also defended his agency 's 56,000 employee workforce as overwhelmingly upright			2
but rep. @entity163 , a @entity165 @entity164 and longtime critic of the @entity3 who requested the audit , is skeptical			1
he told @entity169 that the report shows the @entity3 is not doing enough to respond to and prevent misconduct			1
" there 's not even a way to properly report some of the offenses , so this may be just the tip of the iceberg of some of the offenses , " he said			0
@entity3 agents at @entity117 spared from firings after violations some other lawmakers stood by the agency wednesday , saying the offenses represent a small percentage of @entity3 's 56,000 employees			1
" transportation security officers have an undeniably hard job and the overwhelming majority of them conduct themselves honorably and in accordance with @entity3 protocols , " rep. @entity186 , @entity187 , said during wednesday 's hearing			1
analyst : turn the tables on @entity3 @entity197 airport security analyst @entity196 said the report is n't particularly surprising			2
the @entity3 has been plagued by uneven training for years , he said , resulting in a work force that is n't always properly educated about how to do their jobs			2
" i think @entity203 should not so much be concerned , but take an active role in security , " he said			0
" as they are willing to point out things we do wrong , we should be ready to report on the failure in their security operations , as well			0
" the government report calls on the @entity3 to improve how the agency monitors and follows up on allegations of misconduct			1
the agency has accepted the recommendations , @entity159 said			0

@entity3 deputy chief says agency has a good workforce , moves *quickly* to fire *bad* apples
