-- a timeline of events leading to the april 20 explosion on the @entity5 oil rig in the @entity6 , according to documents from congressional investigators and testimony from witnesses to the disaster : ^ 12:35 a.m. oilfield services contractor @entity12 completes cementing on @entity14 's @entity13 252 well			1
in the hours leading up to midafternoon , crews conduct three positive pressure tests , in which fluid weight is placed on the seal			1
^ 11 a.m. @entity14 and @entity21 executives argue over changes in the drill plan for the well at a meeting aboard the rig			1
^ 5:05 p.m. an unexpected loss of fluid is observed in the riser pipe , suggesting there are leaks in the blowout preventer , a critical piece of equipment designed to shut down the well in the event of an emergency			1
^ 5 - 7 p.m. negative pressure tests , in which crews reduce fluid pressure to test for leaks through the cement or well casing , show unexpected results			1
one draws 15 barrels of liquid out of the well instead of the expected five , raising more concerns about leaks			1
in a second , pressure on the rig 's " kill line " -- a high - pressure pipe used to cut off the flow of oil -- falls to zero , while rising to 1,400 pounds per square inch in the drill line , indicating a buildup of natural gas			2
^ 8 p.m. @entity14 ends testing and proceeds to replace remaining drill fluids with seawater			1
a @entity14 investigator later suggests this is a " fundamental mistake			1
" ^ 9:00 p.m. more fluid is reported flowing out of the well than is being pumped in			2
^ 9:10 p.m. well pump is shut down for a " sheen " test , but the well continues to flow			0
drill pipe pressure unexpectedly increases			2
^ 9:30 p.m. abnormal pressures and more fluid returns are observed			2
the well pump is abruptly shut down			0
^ 9:50 p.m. gas surges from the well and up the riser			0
the supply ship @entity79 , which is tied up alongside @entity5 , reports drilling fluid spilling onto its deck and is told to move back 500 meters from the rig			0
seconds later , the first explosion occurs			0
^ 9:52 p.m. @entity5 issues distress call			0
the order is given to abandon the rig			0
eleven of the 126 on board are lost at sea when the platform sinks two days later .			0
