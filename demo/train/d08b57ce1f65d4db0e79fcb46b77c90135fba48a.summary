-- once upon a time , the @entity1 was a thriving hub of technological innovation			1
before the 1890 census , for example , the bureau commissioned the first punch - card machine for data entry , enabling the bureau to tabulate its surveys of the national population in three years instead of seven			1
then , in the 1940s and ' 50s , the @entity12 funded what 's been called the world 's first commercial computer -- the @entity17 , or @entity17 -- which counted electrical impulses using vacuum tubes			2
today , however , critics see the census -- done every 10 years -- as a technological dinosaur			2
it 's time the @entity1 got away from the 1920 technology , " said @entity24 , a former deputy director of the agency who says he left over its failure to adopt new technologies in recent years			1
while countries like @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 use smartphones , the internet and smartly connected government databases to get relatively fast and cheap counts of their populations , the @entity32 ' census is a pen - and - paper enterprise , with some census workers even walking door to door to collect results			1
" @entity46 is moving that direction			2
not just because they love technology but because they can do so many more things , and they can save a lot of money , " @entity24 said			0
meanwhile , the census ' costs have been rising sharply , often doubling by the decade			0
the 2010 census cost an estimated $ 14 billion , or about $ 100 per household , which still was under its initial budget			0
in 2010 dollars , the 2000 census cost $ 8.2 billion , which was twice as expensive as the census taken before that , in 1990 , when the cost was $ 4.1 billion			0
in 1970 , the census cost $ 1 billion , according to the @entity68			0
the @entity12 could knock up to 25 percent off of its budget if it adopted current technologies , including internet questionnaires , @entity24 said			2
but what would those technological advances look like , exactly ? and would technology be able to solve the @entity12 ' cost problems while maintaining the accuracy of a survey that is supposed to reach every household in this 312 million - person nation ? here 's a look at technologies that critics say the @entity1 should consider			1
internet instead of paper perhaps the most obvious way the @entity1 lags technologically is that it collects data about the country by mailing surveys to peoples ' homes			1
shortcut : send the forms over the internet			1
" a lot of people now are much more accustomed to working with their computer and communicating online and via the internet , " said @entity95 , director of strategic issues at the @entity97 , which has written reports on the @entity12 ' use of technology			1
" and so people might be more willing to respond via the internet as opposed to filling out the form that they 're mailed			2
" @entity34 tried a version of this for its last national census , in 2006 , and it was considered a success			1
nearly 19 percent of people responded online rather than on paper forms			1
to mitigate security concerns , the @entity34 sent out paper notices with individual codes to people 's homes			1
when respondents logged on to complete the survey , they entered that code to identify themselves as the person or people living in that household			0
even proponents have concerns about security risks , however			0
" it seems like anyone with half a brain would answer the census on the internet			2
it seems like low - hanging fruit , " @entity24 said			0
" but i ... was never able to be convinced that we could ensure the security and the integrity of the internet answers			2
when we take your census , we promise you that we will not let anybody but the census see your information			0
" the @entity1 ran tests with internet surveys in 2003 and 2005 , and neither showed significant cost savings , possibly because people then were less familiar with the internet than they are now , said @entity151 , chief of the @entity152 and an architect of the 2010 census			1
the bureau plans to use online forms in 2020 , he said			1
" maybe we look old - fashioned in not having an internet response option , but i think if you look around the world at censuses that have used internet response options , a lot of times , they 've done it not to look old - fashioned rather than for methodological reasons or cost reductions , " he said			1
@entity168 , former director of the @entity1 and now a professor at @entity171 's @entity170 , said internet technology is n't a cure - all , however			1
" it 's irrational to think the internet would somehow solve " all of the @entity12 ' cost problems , since people would still forget to respond , he said			2
smartphones instead of pencils the @entity1 spends a large percentage of its budget following up with people who do n't answer the questions on the first questionnaire it sends out to homes			1
the reason for this : the @entity12 aims to be 100 percent accurate			0
its figures even have political ramifications , as census data determine how many representatives states send to @entity192			2
consequently , @entity12 workers are required to contact a person six times if he or she do n't respond			2
this is called " non-response follow - up " in census - speak , and it 's a fairly low - tech process , with workers going door to door searching for delinquents , interviewing them and scratching down the answers on paper			0
those papers are then sorted by local @entity12 workers , mailed to a processing center , scanned by a text - reading computer and entered into the system			0
the @entity12 tried to speed up this process by sending workers to peoples ' doors with portable computers -- kind of like tablets or smartphones , except the @entity12 paid to have these gadgets developed because they did n't exist early in the 2000s , when the bureau was planning for 2010			1
those " handhelds , " as the @entity12 calls them , were built for the government by the @entity221 in pre-census tests , they did n't fare well , and the bureau decided to scrap them			1
@entity35 , meanwhile , has pushed ahead of the @entity32 with a smartphone census			1
and it did so after consulting with the @entity1 in 2006 about its plans to use handheld devices , @entity151 said			1
@entity231 , a consultant who works with businesses and other stakeholders on census issues , said the fact that the @entity1 has to plan a decade in advance makes it difficult for it to get the latest technology			1
" what is considered cutting - edge or emerging technology now could be obsolete or a lot better nine years from now , " she said			0
still , she said , the @entity1 has been slow to adopt new technology and needs to work more closely with the tech industry to stay on top of trends			1
she recalls meetings in the early 2000s where @entity12 workers talked about these failed portable computers			0
at the time , the internet had just become a major force in society , and the idea sounded " space - age , " she said			2
" they 're biting off more they can chew without really considering the steps it will take to get there , " she said			0
using available data it 's not as sexy as the internet and smartphones , but several critics of the census said the bureau should do more with data that already exist , rather than collecting all of the information on its own			1
the @entity271 , the @entity272 , @entity273 and local school registries all collect data on the @entity32 public			1
with a little work , the critics said , that data could be standardized and used to supplement the census			2
this could mean better coordination among government agencies , which sometimes are forbidden by law to share data with each other			2
or it could mean a national registry system , which would be updated with addresses and unemployment info continuously , instead of every 10 years			0
that 's essentially the setup in @entity36			0
" if we had a national registration system in which everyone 's mobile phone number and e-mail was part of that @entity300 , boy , that would simplify things enormously , " said @entity168 , the @entity171 professor			0
" you could save a ton of money			0
" getting something like that approved , however , would be a political nightmare because of concerns about privacy and government tracking , he said			0
" people say ' oh , my gosh , the government 's going to come in the middle of the night and rush me off to prison , ' " he said			0
" i think a rational conversation -- if one can have one in the @entity192 -- about a national registration system would be a very good thing			0
" the @entity1 plans to research ways government databases could be used as a backup source of information , allowing workers to follow up with people who do n't respond to the first census mailing two or three times instead of six , said the bureau 's @entity151			1
it 's unlikely that a government registration number will be on the table for the 2020 census , he said			0
" we think there are some opportunities there for cost savings , " he said			0
overall , @entity151 said , the census continues to work with new technologies and will push tech boundaries in the future			0
" the research we do very often does lead to major innovation technologically , and i think it 's very possible moving forward , " he said .			0

critics say the @entity1 should adapt to the internet age
@entity34 gives *residents* the option of submitting forms online ; the @entity32 does n't
others urge the bureau to use smartphones in data collection
