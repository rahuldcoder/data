-- never during its 92 year history has the @entity1 experienced anything like this : battles everywhere , but not inside stadiums			1
they 're occurring in federal courtrooms , where more than 100 former players are suing the league over various health issues they claim were caused by negligence on the part of everybody from the commissioner to trainers to coaches			2
the more @entity19 spoke on the other end of the phone from his home in @entity23 , @entity24 , the more he delivered a blindsided sack to conventional wisdom			1
this was after i asked the former cornerback great for the @entity32 / @entity31 @entity30 whether coaches , team executives or even leagues are responsible for the epidemic of long - term injuries to current and former players			1
does brain injury link @entity1 players , wounded warriors ? @entity19 responded with the speed of a blitz			1
despite his lifelong battle with stuttering , he said clearly , " it 's all on the players , not anybody else , because the players have the same gladiator genes that existed in @entity51 over 2,000 years ago			1
they have a love of football to the 10th power			2
so the players make the final call			2
no matter what they are told by doctors or anybody else , they will fight to play			2
" let that sink in for a moment			0
now consider that a slew of @entity19 ' former @entity1 peers disagree			1
in fact , @entity70 runner @entity69 just joined all those other retired players in filing lawsuits in federal courts alleging that the league has n't done enough to protect players from concussions and other football - related injuries			1
@entity81 linebacker choosing career over concussions there also have been at least 12 suicides involving former @entity1 players during the last 25 years , including perennial @entity88 defenders @entity86 and @entity89 within the last 14 months			1
according to the suing players , such tragedies are related to the league 's negligence in fully explaining the health risk of concussions to players			1
not only that , the suing players claim the league is n't allocating enough of its estimated $ 9 billion in total revenue each season toward the proper care of its current and former players suffering from head trauma and other football - related injuries			1
all @entity19 knows is that , at 57 and in the midst of his decades - long run as a football youth coach in @entity23 , his health is just fine after his 10 years with the @entity30 through 1986			1
no knee or back troubles			0
remember , too , that @entity19 played during that generation of @entity30 teams noted for mixing it up so much that he said the collisions " sounded like a 12 - gauge shotgun blast			1
" he contributed to more than a few of those blasts with noted enforcers for the @entity30 such as @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			2
along @entity19 ' way to five @entity88 , two @entity125 rings and 1980 @entity1 @entity127 honors , he was known as everything from @entity19 the molester to @entity19 to the only @entity130			1
now just call him @entity18			0
" lord , have mercy			0
it 's so much safer to play in the @entity1 these days than during my time , " @entity19 said , referring to the @entity133 joining former players in urging the league to make things even safer			1
you 've had @entity1 commissioner @entity141 doing everything from moving kickoffs up five yards ( to reduce the number of injuries on kickoff returns ) to delivering heavy fines to defenders who slam into quarterbacks too harshly			1
there also are strict guidelines for teams to follow when a player has just the hint of a concussion			0
@entity19 chuckled , saying , " we did n't have any guidelines			1
you could actually lead with your face mask ( as a defender ) -- putting your face mask on an opposing player 's face mask , without a $ 15,000 fine			2
you could throw a forearm shiver to the throat			0
people played with broken bones			0
guys would carry smelling salt in their socks , so if you got a little woozy on the field , you 'd reach into your sock for help			0
" then there was the " secret room			0
" according to @entity19 , it was a staple for the @entity30			1
" i do n't know what other teams had , but i 'm sure they had something that was similar , " he said , referring to the place at stadiums that players visited on game days to receive a series of painkilling shots			1
that said , @entity19 said @entity30 team doctor @entity187 spent more time trying to talk him and other players out of taking the shots than otherwise			1
" it was 1985 , and i had never missed a game , and me and dr. @entity187 were going at it -- back and forth , and i 'm begging him , just pleading and screaming at him , ' @entity190 , i 've got to play			0
give me the shot , ' " said @entity19 , recalling what was a lengthy shouting match at the time on how to handle his strained calf muscle			2
" the @entity190 is telling me , ' @entity19 , take a few days off			2
i do n't like shooting muscle			0
' but it 's going back and forth , with me yelling			0
and @entity200 rest his soul , he would n't back down , not until i just forced him to do it			0
he always showed a lot of love and compassion			0
" i encountered @entity187 , who died in 1994 , as a @entity30 beat writer for the @entity207 during the early 1980s , so i know @entity19 speaks the truth -- for some @entity30			1
as for others , not so much			0
while offensive lineman @entity211 blamed the amputation of his right foot on a misdiagnosis by @entity187 , defensive end @entity210 once told @entity215 that the typical response of @entity187 to most injuries was , " you 're ok			2
it 's just a bruise			0
" @entity19 said in response , " listen , i 'm waiting there outside of the secret room , observing , listening to @entity190 tell players , ' sit out			1
' they would n't do it , because they were gladiators , and mr. @entity227 had instilled such a will of winning into each of us that we had to get out there			0
" that is mr. @entity227 , as in the @entity227 , the notoriously hard - driving owner of the @entity30 from 1963 until his death in october			1
his motto was " just win , baby , " which makes you wonder			0
" no , no , no. mr. @entity227 never pressured us to play , " @entity19 said			2
" he never , never did			0
it was always the player 's call			0
you ca n't blame mr. @entity227 , and you ca n't blame the doctors , because a lot of guys see stars ( as in being physically dazed ) on the field , but that gladiator gene takes over			2
i never saw dr. @entity187 apply pressure in the secret room , except to try to put us in street clothes on game days			0
" the dissenter laughed , adding , " in the 21st century , i do n't know if secret rooms still exist			0
" if we knew , they would n't be secret .			0

@entity259 says there 's an " epidemic of long - term injuries " to past and present @entity1 players
former players ' lawsuits allege @entity1 did n't help protect them from concussions and other injuries
former @entity30 cornerback @entity19 *argues* injuries are players ' faults
@entity19 told @entity259 players will essentially ignore doctors ' orders for love of the game
