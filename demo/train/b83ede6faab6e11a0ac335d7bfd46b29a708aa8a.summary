-- ask any teen whether he or she suffers from social media anxiety , and the answer will probably be no. that 's what happened when six teens and adolescents -- five from @entity9 and one from @entity11 -- got together recently for a unique weeklong workshop at the offices of @entity14 , a leading women 's lifestyle media platform			1
the teens did n't think that @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , their go - to social networks , added much extra anxiety to their lives			1
but then the conversation turned to the importance of likes and the fear of missing out , also known by the acronym @entity28			1
@entity30 , a 10th - grader in @entity31 , @entity9 , said she 'd never heard the acronym before but is definitely familiar with the feeling			0
" you see on , i guess you could say , @entity19 or even snapchat ... you see your friends hanging out with other people , and you 're like ' oh , i 'm alone right now , ' " she said			1
" and even if there 's no way you could get to them even if you wanted to , it still just makes you feel bad or lonely or sad			0
" the upside of selfies : social media not all bad for kids @entity47 , 12 , said she sometimes feels that way , too			1
" if there 's an event that maybe i 'm not at or my friends are hanging out with each other ... sometimes i kind of feel , i guess , kind of left out			0
" the quest for the ' @entity54 ' the teens and tweens also agreed there is a constant -- and at times anxiety - inducing -- fixation with likes			1
" people will be like , ' oh , are you in the 100 club ? ' " @entity30 said of getting 100 or more likes for a post			1
the 15 - year - old told the story of a friend who changed her profile picture and did n't get the 200 likes she normally gets on the first night whenever she makes such a change			2
" she was freaking out , " she said			0
the more likes , the greater the social standing you appear to have , the girls said			1
" people feel that when they get a lot of likes			2
it means that they 're pretty and popular , and that makes them feel better , " @entity30 said			0
schools step up social media monitoring of students said @entity47 : " i really do notice that a lot of people who get tons of likes and have tons of followers on @entity20 and @entity19 do tend to think that they are really popular and that everyone knows who they are , when ... all their followers have n't even met them before			1
" likes translate into validation and attention , said @entity100 , co-founder of @entity101 , a digital literacy site for parents , educators , and tweens and teens			2
@entity100 also teaches " cybercivics " to middle schoolers in @entity108 , @entity109			0
when she overhears conversations of students , she says , she very often hears things like , " check this out ; i have this many likes			2
" " it 's almost like a little competition for the number of likes , " @entity100 said			2
" i think that 's anxiety - ridden , because you get likes based on how many friends you have , and you have to keep posting things to get more friends and it 's like a vicious circle			2
" @entity100 says this phenomenon was illustrated by a recent assignment in her classroom			0
she asked her students to try to go 24 hours without social media during one of three weekends			1
middle school transition tough for teens and parents of the 28 students , only one was able to do it			0
the teens could n't stand not knowing what their friends were doing , @entity100 said			0
" it was very hard			0
i kept getting tempted by my phone and my friends , " wrote one student , who said he could last only five hours in his social - media - free zone			2
research : social media can make you feel sad studies show that social media can actually make you feel bad about yourself			1
according to a study last year by the @entity157 , the more people checked @entity19 , the worse they felt about their lives			1
another study , this one by @entity160 researchers , found that a third of people felt worse after spending time on @entity19 , especially if they spent time viewing vacation photographs			1
helping students realize the impact of social media on them was a big goal of the summer workshop held by @entity14			1
that workshop also served as a pilot for a program called @entity173 , which was just launched by the company			0
as part of the new effort , kids ages 9 to 16 create videos for adults , said @entity180 , @entity14 's chief revenue officer			0
the informal tag line for the program is " content for grown - ups made by kids on a mission , " she said			0
what counts as a real name on @entity19 " it 's content by kids , but it 's really meant to address topics of interest to their parents in many cases , " she said			1
" the mission component is focused on teaching them digital literacy and citizenship while also allowing them to play with digital storytelling			0
" @entity202 , an 11th - grader in @entity11 who participated in the @entity173 pilot program , said she did n't really give much thought to the notion that digital media can impact people emotionally until there was a discussion about its psychological effect			1
" and i found out that i am kind of neurotic about some things , " she said			0
" for example , when i text someone and i think that i might have made them upset because they did n't reply right away , i automatically assume that they got mad at me			0
" to prevent that from happening , she admits closing nearly all texts with a smiley , exclamation point or @entity221			0
@entity30 , who also participated in the @entity173 pilot , says she now looks at @entity21 and @entity19 a bit differently			2
" i know ( they ) can also have a negative psychological effect that i feel like did n't occur to me as much , " she said			0
starting conversations early the takeaway from the workshop , said @entity180 , was that there is a " huge opportunity " to talk with teens about social media			1
" a lot of them say that educators are not talking to them about media and social media unless they 're telling them not to do something			1
" talking about social media early and often is key , says @entity100 , who did a demonstration this month for principals and other educators from across the state of @entity109 on how she teaches digital literacy and citizenship to teens			1
how to cut your child 's cell phone addiction " i always say to parents : it 's not one conversation			0
it 's a thousand small conversations , and it is really starting young , " she said			2
take an interest in what your children are doing online and have them show you why they like it , she said			0
" and then you are in the circle , " she added			0
" it 's pretty easy to get there but you have to start when they are young			2
" @entity100 , who starts teaching students in the sixth grade , said it often takes her students until the eighth grade to figure out all the social media angst " ai n't worth it			1
" " it 's a huge trajectory to get there ... when they start saying , ' gosh that 's a waste of my time			0
' " do you get anxious if you do n't get a certain number of likes on social media posts ? tell @entity281 on @entity282 or @entity283 on @entity19 .			1
