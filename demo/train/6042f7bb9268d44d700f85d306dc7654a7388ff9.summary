as a tenuous peace holds in the @entity2 city of @entity3 , many of its residents are returning home for the first time in years to see what war spared them			1
the neighborhood known as @entity11 on monday looked entirely dusty and gray			0
many of its buildings , many thousands of years old , are heaps of rubble after non-stop of shelling			0
@entity20 sweated in the midday sun , cleaning up his trashed shoe store			0
he came back to @entity3 to take inventory , he told @entity25 's @entity24 , who met him there			1
@entity20 escaped @entity3 two years ago and has been living in @entity27 , where he managed to open another shoe store			1
remembering the time he was forced from his home , he simply said , " it was awful			0
" less than a mile from where @entity33 picked up rebar and threw it into a pile , some parts of @entity3 look untouched by war			1
sports stores are open , selling @entity39 and @entity40			2
lines are moving briskly in clean and stocked grocery stores			2
people pass time at busy cafes			2
but that 's the reality of the place -- some parts were hit , others were not			0
@entity3 was , though , the center of the first large demonstrations against president @entity51 in 2011			1
now it is one of the areas of the country where stability may hold			0
rebels withdrew from @entity3 last week			1
a truce was declared after rebels agreed to a prisoner release involving 70 @entity63 @entity62 fighters , 20 @entity64 officers captured by the @entity65 in @entity66 and a female @entity64 agent who was captured at the end of march			1
@entity62 and @entity64 have backed @entity51 's government in the war			1
in @entity11 , it would be understandable if @entity2 felt bitter , angry or pessimistic			1
there is no water or electricity in many areas			0
attempts at peace coordinated by international diplomats have fallen through in the past			0
nearly everyone has a story of loss			0
at least 2,500 people were trapped in @entity3 , and it was incredibly difficult to deliver humanitarian aid to the city			1
the war has taken , by most estimates , at least 100,000 lives and has displaced millions			2
as if the situation could get any more brutal , looters showed up in @entity11 to swipe whatever was left in the ruins , @entity2 told @entity93			1
and yet many @entity2 seemed optimistic			1
most were friendly , though some politely told the correspondent they did n't want to talk on camera			0
they explained that they just wanted to focus on seeing what possessions they could reclaim			0
some heaved mattresses and refrigerators and shoved them onto truck beds			0
they thought the truce would stick			2
travel was once a life - risking endeavor in @entity3			1
but on monday drivers rolled through checkpoints staffed by @entity2 government soldiers			1
even they were unusually friendly , telling @entity24 they thought that @entity113 media has misrepresented them as the bad guys in the civil war			2
one soldier told @entity24 that he supports the truce between the rebels and the government			1
" i think this was the best thing , " said the soldier who did not give his name			0
" it gives the people the chance to come back and start rebuilding their lives			0
" @entity2 war fast facts - revisit the history of the conflict the roots of the war in @entity2 began in march 2011 after a group of teenagers and children were arrested for writing political graffiti that disparaged @entity51 , who has controlled the country since july 2000			1
his father , @entity138 , ruled @entity2 from 1970 to 2000			2
when protests stirred over the arrests , the @entity2 government violently cracked down , and violence followed , metastasizing throughout the country			1
over time the civil war grew more complicated and involved various fighters , some of whom were @entity2 , some of whom were from other countries			1
by march 2012 , after one year of fighting , the @entity152 reported that more than 8,000 people had died			2

by february 2013 , the @entity161 estimated that the number of civilians killed in the two - year civil war was approaching 70,000			0
in a january 2014 report , @entity165 slammed international powers for failing to stop " the unchecked slaughter of civilians in @entity2			2
" the bloodshed , @entity165 said , " elicited global horror and outrage but not enough to convince world leaders to exert the pressure needed to stop it			0

a truce was declared between rebels and the @entity2 government
@entity3 residents who escaped the fighting returned to their homes
