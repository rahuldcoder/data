this year is the centennial of the @entity1			0
one - hundred years ago this month , in april 1914 , no one thought there would be a war			1
but war began , triggered by events in @entity7 , by the end of july			1
it came as an enormous shock , in retrospect almost like the @entity12 hitting an iceberg			0
in the end , it shattered @entity7 , cost tens of millions of lives , bankrupted countries and changed forever those who survived the horrors			2
a century later , our focus is again on @entity7 , the site of a regional conflict that threatens to entangle the world 's leading powers			1
the situation in @entity26 is a perilous one , much more so than our current debate acknowledges			2
in @entity28 , we are dealing with the largest country in the world geographically , a country that possesses thousands of nuclear weapons , plenty of ballistic missiles and a ruthlessly determined leader motivated by nationalism and an imperial drive : a leader who also has an entrenched machine capable of keeping him in power for a long time			2
in @entity26 , we are dealing with an ally that fought alongside us in @entity44 and @entity45 , and a nation now threatened with conquest by a much stronger neighbor against which it can not defend itself			2
in @entity7 , we are dealing with a continent that for more than half a century has relied on the @entity52 to guarantee peace , security and freedom			1
we have kept that promise through @entity57 , the alliance that war in @entity7 threatens seriously to undermine			1
and in the @entity52 , we are dealing with a nation weary of war after more than a decade spent in @entity44 and @entity45 , and a public wary of more armed intervention abroad			1
we need a national debate on what our policy is going to be			0
and then we need to engage our friends in @entity7 on what our policy is going to be			1
as retired former @entity57 commander gen. @entity68 and his colleague dr. @entity69 , a former @entity66 official , detail in their recent report from @entity26 , the @entity67 @entity66 has adopted a position of not helping that country with any offensive weapons			2
offensive weapons including , for example , @entity78 vests , night vision equipment and aviation fuel			0
so while the @entity52 has sent thousands of meals ready to eat ( @entity84 rations ) to a country that is an agricultural exporter , the administration has refused to send even nonlethal equipment that would help @entity26 defend itself and possibly avert war			1
instead of sending military supplies to @entity26 , we hear talk of more sanctions			1
and yet , as i discuss in my podcast this week , i suspect it will be apparent very quickly that sanctions against @entity28 president @entity96 are going to be irrelevant			1
he is a very tough man			0
he heads a very big country with immense natural resources			0
he can cause pain fully as much as his neighbors can cause him pain			0
he can block @entity52 shipments to @entity45 from coming through @entity28 by the northern route			1
he can cut off natural gas flow to @entity106			0
he has a veto at the @entity108 , and can obstruct further sanctions against @entity110			0
this is a very difficult situation , and we are now in two enormous dangers			0
first , of the @entity67 administration doing too little , in which case the world will become less safe as we show weakness to our allies and the @entity28 seek to reconstitute the @entity120 empire			0
and second , of doing things too clumsily , in which case , as one - hundred years ago , a bad combination of miscalculations , delusions , laws and alliances could land us in a war no one intends .			0

@entity131 : a century ago , no one *expected* events in @entity7 to trigger war
he says the @entity26 *crisis* requires *careful* thinking about *correct* @entity52 policy
@entity141 says too timid policy could *invite* @entity28 *expansionism*
he says sanctions are unlikely to work , and clumsy *tactics* could *backfire*
