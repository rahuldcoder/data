-- if you had caught me straight out of college at age 22 in the halls of the @entity6 where i was a lobbyist - in - training and asked me what i was gon na do with my life , i would have told you that i had just passed the @entity10 , otherwise known as the @entity12 equivalency exam , and was planning to study law at @entity14 with the intention to improve @entity18 - @entity17 relations through top - down policy changes and judicial system reforms			1
i had it all figured out			0
little did i know how much my life would change when one night i heard @entity22 singing " @entity27 " from a record player in the corner of a room at a party : " @entity27 my little love , @entity27 my darlin ' , @entity27 my little love , i 'm - a - goin ' back to @entity31			1
" the rippling trance of an old - time banjo groove , and @entity22 's soulful voice layered on top , the sound of merging immigrant cultures of old @entity35 and @entity36 in @entity37 -- it was all so beautiful			1
and , after having been obsessed with the mammoth history and richness of @entity12 culture for years , i was relieved to find something so truly beautiful that is so truly @entity18			1
i knew i had to get a banjo and bring it with me to @entity17			2
@entity48 : @entity49 sings " @entity50 " before leaving for law school in @entity17 i jumped in my little red truck , threw my newly bought old - time banjo in the back , and went on a road trip through @entity37 to learn some old - time @entity18 music			1
i ended up in @entity57 , @entity58 , at the @entity60 convention			0
and here 's where the story gets nutty : i met two girls in a hallway , i nervously played a couple of old - time songs with them and a record executive walked up and invited me to come to @entity69 to make a record ! fast - forward a year , i delayed going to law school in @entity73 , and instead lived in @entity69 and learned to write songs			2
my first song came out in @entity76 , titled " @entity77 , " and my second song in @entity12 , " @entity79 " : @entity80 （ men wai you ge shijie ） @entity84 （ @entity85 zhong you ge shengyin ） @entity86 ） @entity87 （ you nu you nu ） translation : " outside your door the world is waiting " inside your heart a voice is calling " the four corners of the world are watching " so travel daughter , travel ... go get it girl " it 's been eight years since that miraculous night in @entity58			2
i have performed in thousands of shows , including tours in @entity17 and collaborations with all kinds of inspirational musicians and artists			0
@entity48 : @entity105 on nurturing creativity music is a powerful way to connect cultures			2
i see it when i 'm on a stage at a bluegrass festival in @entity113			0
when i look out at the sea of people in lawn chairs and bust into a song in @entity12 , everybody 's eyes pop wide open and they nudge their neighbor : " is that girl singing in @entity12 ? " after a show , people would come up to me ; everyone seems to have a story about their connection to @entity17			1
and i see the power of music when i 'm on stage in @entity17 : i start a @entity12 song and the audience roars with delight that the blond , curly - haired girl with the banjo can sing their music			1
more importantly , i see how music directly connects people 's hearts			0
like the time a little @entity12 girl came up to me after i performed at a relocation school in @entity143 's earthquake disaster zone and asked : " @entity144 , can i sing you a song that my mom sang before she was swallowed in the earthquake ... ? " she sat on my lap and i could feel the warmth of her body			0
she sang me the song , and tears started rolling down her cheeks and tears started rolling down mine			0
the light shining from her eyes felt like a place i could stay forever			0
@entity48 : @entity160 : the generation that 's remaking @entity17 in that moment , we were n't our @entity12 or our @entity18 selves			1
we were mortal souls sitting together in that light that keeps us here			0
i long to dwell in that light ... with you and everybody ... and i know @entity18 - @entity17 relations does n't need another lawyer			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0

@entity171 : i wanted to be study law and help improve @entity18 - @entity17 relations
@entity171 : one night i heard @entity22 sing and my life changed
she says that she got a banjo and started learning music and singing @entity12 songs
@entity171 : music is a powerful way to connect people and cultures
