-- i spoke at @entity3 in 2006 , the year they started to put the talks online			1
i 'm told that since then , the talk has been downloaded more than 3.5 million times in more than 200 countries			1
the number of people who 've seen it may be 20 times that or more			1
i have a stream of e-mails , tweets and blog posts round the world from young people , parents , students , teachers , cultural activists and business leaders of all sorts			1
they tell me how deeply they relate to the talk and often that they 've seen or shown it many times at meetings , conferences , workshops and retreats			2
parents tell me they 've shown it to their children ; young people tell me they 've shown it to their parents			2
they say they 've laughed and sometimes cried together and had a different sort of conversation as a result			2
changing the conversation is one of the primary purposes of @entity3			2
why has this talk had such an impact ? i think there are several reasons			2
to begin with , the talk is short			2
the 18 - minute talk is part of the genius of @entity3			2
in a world of instant messaging , rampant data and overspecialization , brevity is a virtue			2
( even so , i 've seen blogs that strongly recommend the talk but warn that it 's almost 20 minutes long			2
) a second factor is that , based on the audience 's reaction , the talk is entertaining and funny at times , which always helps			2
and i 'd just had my hair cut			2
we may never know how much that simple act contributed to the global appeal of the talk			0
but the real reason for its impact is that what i 'm saying clearly resonates deeply with people of all ages and across many different cultures			0
i believe that the argument is becoming more urgent by the day			0
what is the argument ? in a nutshell , it 's that we 're all born with immense natural talents but our institutions , especially education , tend to stifle many of them and as a result we are fomenting a human and an economic disaster			1
in education , this vast waste of talent involves a combination of factors			0
they include a narrow emphasis on certain sorts of academic work ; the exile of arts , humanities and physical education programs from schools ; arid approaches to teaching math and sciences ; an obsessive culture of standardized testing and tight financial pressures to teach to the tests			1
the result is a disastrous waste of talent among students and their teachers			1
to sense the scale of this disaster , you only have to look at the alarming rates of turnover among faculty and the levels of drop out , disaffection , stress and prescription drug use among students			1
even for students who stay the course and do well in education , the rules of success have changed irrevocably			1
just look at the plummeting value of college degrees			0
the waste of talent in education is not deliberate			0
teachers are as anxious about this as everyone else , but many of them feel trapped in the awkward groping of national reform policies , many of which misunderstand the problems as well as the solutions			0
the waste of talent is n't deliberate , but it is systematic			1
it happens in part because the dominant systems of education are rooted in the values and demands of industrialism : they are linear , mechanistic and focused on conformity and standardization			1
nowadays , they 're buttressed by major commercial interests in mass testing and by the indiscriminate use of prescription drugs that keep students ' minds from wandering to things they naturally find more interesting			1
the tragedy is that meeting the many social , economic , spiritual and environmental challenges we now face depends absolutely on the very capacities of insight , creativity and innovation that these systems are systematically suppressing in yet another generation of young people			1
reforming these systems is not enough			1
the truth is that we are caught up in a cultural and economic revolution			0
this revolution is global in scale and unpredictable in nature			0
to meet it , we need a revolution in the culture of education			0
this new culture has to emerge from a richer sense of human ability			0
to shape it , i believe we have to leave behind the manufacturing principles of industrialism and embrace the organic principles of ecology			0
education is about developing human beings , and human development is not mechanical or linear			0
it is organic and dynamic			0
like all living forms , we flourish in certain conditions and shrivel in others			1
great teachers , great parents and great leaders understand those conditions intuitively ; poor ones do n't			1
the answer is not to standardize education , but to personalize and customize it to the needs of each child and community			0
the good news is that all around the world there are wonderful examples of people and organizations that are making determined efforts to do things differently in education -- and in business , health care , architecture , communities and cultural programs			0
there are examples of these all over the @entity3 web site and in the expanding ripples of the @entity3 prizes			0
@entity3 itself is a great example of the spirit of collaboration and inter-disciplinarily that is the essential to a genuine culture of creativity			1
what are the principles of this culture ? towards the end of my talk , i mention a book i was working on called " @entity255			0
" it was published this year under a much better title , " the element : how @entity260 " ( @entity261 ) and is now in 11 languages			0
it draws on conversations with people in science , business , education , the arts , sports and more on how they found in themselves the talents and passions that have shaped their lives			1
but the book is not about them : it 's about you and your children , if you have any ; and your friends too , if you have any of those			0
there 's a wealth of talent that lies in all of us			0
all of us , including those who work in schools , must nurture creativity systematically and not kill it unwittingly			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sir @entity290 .			1

sir @entity290 : we 're born with great natural talents
he says schools systematically suppress many of those innate talents
schools use testing and other systems to narrowly assess students , he says
he says they *devalue* forms of creativity that do n't fit in academic *contexts*
