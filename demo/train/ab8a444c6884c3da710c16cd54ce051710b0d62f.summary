-- could one of aviation 's most enduring mysteries be solved ? an aircraft recovery group says it may already have a part of @entity6 's plane , and it thinks it knows where to find the rest of it			1
the @entity10 says new testing of a piece of metal found in the vast waters of the @entity15 in 1991 gives the group " increasing confidence " that it 's a part of the @entity19			1
in a press release the group argues that the aluminum debris is likely a patch that @entity6 had put on her plane in place of a window			1
the group says the patch had a distinctive shape , size and " pattern of rivets			2
" " the patch was as unique to her particular aircraft as a fingerprint is to an individual , " the group wrote			1
now the groups says research on the aluminum " matches that fingerprint in many respects			0
" @entity45 's @entity19 never made it back from an attempt to circle the globe in 1937			0
deserted island theory over the years many theories have emerged			1
for example : @entity6 's plane was forced down by the @entity53 around the @entity54			1
or even , @entity6 secretly returned to the @entity55 and the government gave her a new identity			2
but @entity10 has developed its own theory			1
the @entity60 - based group believes @entity6 actually landed safely			1
the groups says she and her navigator @entity62 set the plane down on a reef on a deserted island in the @entity15 called @entity66			1
the group lays out what it thinks happened next in its press release : @entity6 " sent radio distress calls for at least five nights before the @entity19 was washed into the ocean by rising tides and surf leaving @entity6 and @entity74 cast away on the uninhabited atoll			1
" the group , which operates as a nonprofit , is n't deterred by the fact that its previous searches of the area in 2010 and 2012 turned up no debris			0
that 's because the group thinks the plane may be resting in mostly one piece			1
@entity10 came up empty two years ago , but it thinks during that search it may have uncovered the plane itself			2
" several months after the 2012 expedition a member of @entity92 's online @entity91 spotted an unusual feature in the sonar imagery , " the group says			2
six hundred feet below the waves , at the base of a cliff , the group detected an " anomaly in the underwater topography			0
" an anomaly further analysis shows , the group says , an object the " right size and shape " of @entity19 's fuselage			2
it 's not the first time this group has made a splash with its findings			2
when it first discovered sonar imagery of the " anomaly " the group got tepid reaction from @entity118 , caretaker and historian of the @entity120			0
" we do n't want to shrug off the hard work anyone is doing			0
we do like the idea that people are still interested , " she said at the time			0
" but we 're skeptical			0
" and the group itself is n't ready to say for sure it has cracked this cold case			0
" is the anomaly the aircraft ? " the group asks			0
" the only way to know is to go look			0
" and in june of 2015 the groups says it will spend 24 days doing just that .			0

aircraft recovery group says metal piece may be from @entity6 's plane
group : metal patch is " as unique to her particular aircraft as a fingerprint is to an individual "
@entity10 's theory is that @entity6 's plane landed on @entity66 , a deserted island in the @entity15
in june 2015 , group will go to island to try and find the plane
