@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 makes no apologies for her support			1
sure , she is upset her friends who work for the federal government have been furloughed			2
and yes , she dislikes that her family 's favorite hiking spot at one of @entity1 's premier national parks has been closed by the budget battle			1
but she stands by @entity14 rep. @entity13 , one of the approximately 40 tea party and conservative @entity15 in the @entity14 @entity17 considered the architects of the government shutdown aimed at dismantling or defunding the @entity21 , also referred to as @entity21			1
for many , @entity13 and these other lawmakers are responsible for furloughing hundreds of thousands of federal workers , closing national parks and monuments and shuttering federal research			1
but for many of those in their districts -- people like @entity31 and her family -- these representatives are soldiers in a battle of principle , standing up to an out - of - control government			1
" he 's standing up for what he believes , and somebody has to do that , " said @entity31 , 37			1
with the government shutdown that began october 1 in its second week , there was little question the country was beginning to feel the financial squeeze			1
a @entity2 / @entity47 survey released this week found that although slightly more people were angry at @entity15 than @entity50 or president @entity51 for the shutdown , both sides were taking a hit			1
according to the poll conducted over the weekend , 63 % of respondents said they were angry at the republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown , while 57 % expressed anger at @entity50 and 53 % at @entity51			1
" it looks like there is more than enough blame to go around , and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown , " @entity2 polling director @entity60 said			1
@entity67 strikes deal with charity to pay military death benefits ' what my district wants ' but the national anger is unlikely to change the position of these conservative republicans			2
just ask rep. @entity76 of @entity77 , who was elected to @entity78 in 2012			0
he told reporters that his support for the shutdown was simple : " all that really matters is what my district wants			1
and my district is overwhelmingly in favor of my position			2
" or ask rep. @entity86 , who represents the western part of @entity88			2
" my job first is to make sure i represent the people back home , " @entity86 told @entity2 recently			0
" i do n't believe that when i get here that people expect me to look at the political implications			0
that 's for somebody else to focus on			2
" @entity13 has been a frontrunner among those in @entity78 working to overturn @entity51 's signature health care law that passed in 2010 when @entity50 controlled both houses of @entity78			1
" a majority of @entity14 think @entity21 will make health care in our country worse , and they 're right , " the 71 - year - old @entity13 said recently			1
his stance against the @entity21 has earned him an enormous amount of support among his constituents in @entity1 's 11th @entity108 , which covers the northwest suburbs of @entity110			1
nowhere is the government shutdown more on display in @entity13 's district than in @entity0 , a city of about 30,000 that is home to federal employees and military personnel from nearby @entity116 in @entity117			1
it 's also apparent at the popular @entity119 , where black metal gates have been chained			2
a sign posted on the gates announces the park 's closure , citing the government shutdown			1
5 crazy side effects from the shutdown closing ' the mountain ' among locals , it 's simply known as " the mountain , " a place where outdoor enthusiasts come by the thousands to use the dog - friendly park 's miles and miles of hiking and walking trails			1
standing outside the gate , @entity138 , 36 , looked toward the nearly empty park where a handful of people entered using pedestrian walkways			2
" i applaud him for what he 's doing , " she said of @entity13 's stance			1
the 36 - year - old homemaker from @entity0 said she knows the spending bill stalled in @entity78 has nothing to do with @entity21			0
but there needs to be a conversation about it , @entity138 said			0
" it ca n't be one - sided			0
right now , it 's ( @entity51 's ) way or no way , " she said			2
@entity138 pointed to the park , saying its closure was a scare tactic			0
" why would you close a park ? " she said			0
" ... it 's a big thing that says the government shut down			2
" of the 32 families in @entity31 's neighborhood , she knows of a number -- all federal workers -- hit by the government shutdown			1
turning to her 10 - year - old son , @entity171 , @entity31 asks : " how many of your friends ' dads are home right now ? " @entity171 counts on his fingers : one			0
@entity31 knows another five or six people , mostly friends , who have been classified as " non-essential " federal employees			0
they have been furloughed , she said			0
" i 'm not happy about it			0
my friends are out of work , and i hate that this is happening to them , " she said			0
the @entity185 expect their small telecommunications business will take a hit as a result of the government shutdown			2
" when people do n't get paid , they ca n't pay their long - distance bill			0
so , yeah , we are going to feel it if this goes on , " @entity31 said			0
but the @entity195 also expect to feel a financial pinch with the new requirements of the @entity21			0
today , she said , she pays $ 16,000 a year to cover her family , including her husband and three children			0
the family does n't expect to get a financial break with the new insurance requirements			0
in fact , @entity31 said , her family expects to pay more			0
@entity13 , @entity31 said , is fighting on behalf of her family			1
" yes , i 'll vote for him again , " she said			0
