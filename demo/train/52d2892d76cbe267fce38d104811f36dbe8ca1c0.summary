@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 remain top of the world rankings for the ninth straight month , according to newly released standings by @entity6 , the world game 's governing body			1
@entity9 champions @entity3 are ranked @entity10 by @entity6 in their world rankings			1
the @entity9 champions have not lost a game since going down 1 - 0 in a friendly to @entity15 in @entity16 in november 2006			2
they top their 2010 @entity19 qualifying group , with four wins from four games , and have only conceded one goal in their last 10 internationals			2
no team can compete with that record and @entity3 are placed at @entity10 for that reason			1
their rankings are based on team performances over the last four years , with more recent results and more significant matches being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team			2
yet fans all over the world have long questioned how much can be read into the rankings			1
after the @entity39 , @entity38 - based football columnist @entity37 wrote : " do n't try making any sense of these rankings			1
after all , @entity42 , which just won the @entity39 for a second straight time , is ranked 29th , fourth best among @entity45 teams			0
" do you think @entity6 's rankings count for much ? let us know in the @entity50 box below			1
for example , @entity51 , who reached the @entity19 final in 2006 are down in 12th , while @entity0 , who failed to even qualify for @entity56 , are ninth			1
furthermore , @entity57 were at their lowest - ever standing in the rankings in april 1998 , when they were down in 25th			0
three months later , they lifted the @entity19			0
from 2001 - 06 , @entity59 were anchored in the top 10 , at one point as high as fourth , which left many @entity9 fans wondering how that was possible			2
they were ahead of many a supposed @entity9 powerhouse , such as @entity66			0
not only did the @entity69 country reach the final of @entity71 , they also made the semi-finals of the @entity19 in @entity73 two years later			0
@entity59 were even in the same group as @entity66 at the @entity19 and finished five points behind them in second place			0
in the round of 16 @entity59 fell to skilful but flawed @entity80 side			0
surely the yardstick is the planet 's biggest tournament ? there is luck involved , of course , as it 's knockout football , but the best teams overall tend to go through			2
@entity6 's suggestion that @entity59 were once the fourth - best team in the world does not seem to add up			1
and to suggest that throughout this period they were better than @entity66 does not ring true -- not when performances on the pitch indicate otherwise			0
other ranking systems , compiled by football statisticians , have been founded as an alternative to @entity6 's , which began in 1993			1
criticism that calculating rankings over an eight - year period was unrepresentative of a team 's recent performances led to @entity6 revamping their system after the last @entity19			1
" the increasingly high profile of the world ranking has also brought a certain amount of criticism that its calculation formula is too complicated			2
it was therefore decided in 2005 to revise the ranking in order to simplify the way in which it is calculated , " according to @entity6			1
before that there were even more glaring anomalies than today : @entity117 were twice ranked second in the table in the 1990s and the @entity38 were fourth two months before the @entity19 in 2006			0
at the tournament , the @entity38 went home early after picking up one point and two goals in their three group games , which made a mockery of such a high placing			0
as of march 2009 , @entity126 and @entity80 are the only @entity128 teams in the top 10 , @entity127 ( 16 ) are the highest @entity45 nation , the @entity38 are 17th , while @entity131 are the top @entity132 nation at 32			0
but regardless of your opinions of the rankings , they are here to stay			0
and @entity3 deserve respect for becoming only the sixth team after @entity73 , @entity126 , @entity139 , @entity51 and @entity80 to top them .			1

@entity3 remain top of @entity6 's world rankings for the ninth month in a row
@entity6 revamped their ranking system to make it more representative in 2006
football fans are still *unsure* about how accurate the rankings are
