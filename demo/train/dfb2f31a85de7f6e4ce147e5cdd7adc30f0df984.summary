@entity0 -- prominent @entity3 reformist @entity2 called the military 's ouster of president @entity6 the right thing for the country , even as he said all parties -- including @entity6 's @entity10 -- should be part of @entity3 's future			1
" we can not afford @entity3 to fail , " @entity2 told @entity1 on thursday			1
" nobody can afford @entity3 to fail			1
" six years after winning the @entity15 for his work as head of the @entity18 , @entity2 was among those who pushed successfully for the overthrow of president @entity21 in january 2011			1
@entity2 : fast facts @entity6 won that race , but since taking office he has n't won over liberals , reformists and others such as @entity2 who criticized him for not governing for all @entity3 , failing to bolster a faltering economy and promoting a constitution and social policies that some call too restrictive			1
that sentiment boiled over recently in a massive nationwide rally , followed by the military 's demand that @entity6 accede to some of the opposition 's demands			2
he did not , and troops subsequently placed him under house arrest and appointed an interim successor			0
@entity2 , considered to the be leader of the opposition , insists the military 's move is not a coup			2
" either we risk a civil war or ... take extra constitutional measures to ensure that we keep the country together , " he said , explaining the military 's conundrum			1
" this is a recall , and it is nothing novel			0
" the fact that @entity3 is in this situation , the former diplomat said , is difficult , especially given the high hopes many in the @entity58 nation had following @entity21 's exit			2
@entity3 : the most populous country in the @entity62 world the election that @entity6 won was " fairly free , " @entity2 acknowledged			1
" then , unfortunately , the president messed up , " he told @entity1			0
" when you end up with 20 million people in the street , of the state of mind that he needs to go and he needs to go now , it 's a sad state			0
" the diplomat said @entity6 's departure will serve as a " reset , " so @entity3 can start over in forming a constitution and putting together an inclusive government			1
that government should include members of the @entity10 , the @entity76 organization that was banned under @entity21 but has become @entity3 's most powerful political force , according to @entity2			1
he said he assumes @entity6 could even run again for president , " though i do n't think he would			2
" what is the @entity10 ? " i would hope qualified people from the @entity10 , from the @entity82 should be part of this government , " @entity2 said			2
" we need everybody need to be part of the political process			0
we need a cohesive society that is tolerant , that respects each others ' differences			0
" the @entity10 propelled @entity6 into office , although he resigned as leader of its political arm , the @entity95 , after becoming president			2
while @entity2 stated flatly that he personally is n't interested in becoming president , he said he is " deeply concerned " about @entity3 and willing to do what he can to help steer it to a brighter future opinion : will the @entity10 survive ? @entity3 have limited patience after years of political and economic turmoil , he said			1
" my fears are that we do not deliver , " @entity2 said			0
" my fear is that the @entity10 will fear that they are excluded			0
we need a quick delivery			0
and ... we need to show the people that we are really focusing on their basic needs			0
