-- it just had to be him			0
@entity3 scored the winning goal for @entity5 against his old team @entity6 in a 3 - 0 result that some will say already puts an end to the title race in @entity11			1
@entity3 netted in the 66th minute after coming on as a substitute 10 minutes earlier , his low , right - footed shot to the far post beating @entity15 in @entity6			1
@entity16 and @entity17 ended any hopes of a @entity6 comeback by getting the second and third goals in the 85th and 87th minutes , respectively			0
@entity3 did n't dare celebrate in front of the fans clad in yellow and black who once adored him			1
when the @entity11 international 's move to @entity6 's fierce rival was all but confirmed in april -- @entity3 then joined his new teammates in the off - season -- the mood of @entity6 supporters significantly changed and the 21 - year - old became highly unpopular			1
having completed the treble last season -- @entity5 downed @entity6 in the @entity36 final -- @entity38 's men are seemingly on their way to another successful campaign			1
@entity38 's side increased its lead over @entity6 , thought to be @entity5 's only serious challenger in the @entity44 , to seven points			1
@entity6 lost its third straight game in all competitions and would do well to arrest the slump given three of its regular back four are out injured			2
this week for cover @entity6 boss @entity51 was forced to turn to free agent @entity52 , and the 34 - year - old @entity11 international started saturday			2
@entity6 's best chance early fell to @entity55 but the @entity58 striker 's left - footed shot ballooned over the bar			2
@entity55 could incur the wrath of the @entity6 faithful , too , if he shifts to @entity5 -- as expected -- in the near future			1
@entity3 replaced @entity63 amid boos and the displeasure of the locals intensified when the opening goal arrived			1
@entity6 was left wide open as it chased a leveler and @entity16 and @entity17 took advantage			0
no @entity70 , no problem @entity38 's former club @entity72 , deprived of the services of injured forward @entity70 for the rest of 2013 , had little difficulty in dispatching @entity76 4 - 0 at the @entity77 , using a more direct approach			1
@entity79 and the returning @entity80 sent @entity72 on its way with first - half goals from the penalty spot , with @entity84 and @entity85 adding strikes in the second 45 minutes after @entity76 midfielder @entity87 hacked down the latter for a second yellow card			1
" we controlled the pace of the game , knowing when we had to play more directly and when we had to slow the match down , " @entity72 manager @entity93 was quoted as saying by the club website			0
" this side know how to play in different ways when they need to			0
" we have a commitment to play attractive football and i think the fans enjoyed themselves today			0
" @entity72 also played without keeper @entity103 , midfielder @entity104 and fullbacks @entity105 and @entity107			0
@entity72 led @entity108 by three points over @entity110 and was six better than @entity111 going into the weekend and nothing changed by the time saturday ended			1
both @entity111 teams had an even easier time than @entity72			1
@entity110 routed @entity116 7 - 0 and @entity111 won 5 - 0 at @entity117			1
the sizzling @entity119 @entity118 -- who single - handedly accounted for @entity120 in the @entity122 playoffs -- opened the scoring in the third minute for @entity111 but limped off in the 54th			2
" he had a problem with his thigh but i do n't think it will be anything as there was no pain , " @entity111 manager @entity125 told reporters			0
" he will be back soon			0
" @entity133 , in the @entity36 this season , rallied from 3 - 1 down to defeat @entity134 4 - 3			2
@entity136 , like @entity70 a diminutive left - footer , scored all four goals for @entity133			0
@entity140 woe in @entity143 , @entity140 's drought in the league continued as it could only draw 10 - man @entity144 1 - 1 at home			0
@entity146 was given a straight red card shortly before halftime for hauling down @entity149 in the box but the striker missed the resulting spot kick and @entity144 hung on at the @entity153			0
@entity140 , without a @entity155 victory since the middle of october , sits 18 points behind leader @entity158			0
@entity161 's title bid suffered a blow , defeated by @entity163 1 - 0 at home			2
on sunday , @entity165 can leapfrog @entity158 atop the standings by defeating @entity167			0
@entity158 , slowed by successive draws following a record 10 - 0 - 0 start in @entity155 , hosts @entity170 on monday .			2

@entity3 scores the winning goal for @entity5 against old team @entity6
@entity3 did n't celebrate his second - half strike amid a yellow and black wave in @entity6
@entity72 , without the injured @entity70 , *cruises* past @entity76 4 - 0 in @entity178
@entity110 and @entity111 do n't lose *ground* after *convincing* victories
