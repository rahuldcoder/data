-- @entity1 needs to be reformed			2
with polls consistently showing that @entity8 distrust their government and an abundance of evidence that our political system is not working well ( some polls have shown that legislators are less trusted than car salesmen ) , the urgency of improving the rules and procedures through which our politicians govern is essential			1
it is a good time to look back at the @entity18 , most of whom have left town			1
over the past month , two of the giants from this class , @entity25			2
@entity26 and @entity27 have announced that they will retire			2
almost the entire class is gone , other than sen. @entity29 of @entity30 and @entity32 democrat @entity31			2
the class of @entity34 elected in 1974 in the aftermath of president @entity37 's resignation amidst the @entity38 believed that to achieve better policies , legislators needed to clean up the political process			1
@entity37 had been brought down from power as a result of evidence that he had covered up the investigation into whether @entity48 officials had been involved in a burglary at the @entity51 campaign headquarters in the @entity18 complex			1
the new @entity34 were younger than their predecessors , many had been elected in @entity56 districts where voters were furious with @entity37 and many wanted to move beyond the traditional policy orthodoxies that had defined @entity34 since the @entity60			1
unlike so many politicians who keep their eyes focused almost exclusively on what bills they want to pass and accept the political system for what it is , the 75 @entity18 insisted government reform needed to be at the top of the agenda			1
they did n't just complain about government , they took steps to make it work better			1
this was the only way to correct what had gone wrong in the early 1970s			2
" there is a mood of reform in the air on @entity82 , " noted @entity76 when the freshmen arrived			0
when the freshman class arrived to @entity1 , they refused to go along with the status quo			0
one of their biggest steps was to demand that several senior committee chairmen , who were used to having everyone defer to them , answer questions about whether they would be responsive to the interests of the @entity92			0
when a few of them refused , the freshmen led the caucus in stripping them of their power			0
@entity97 , the crusty old chairman of the @entity98 , insulted the freshmen by calling them " boys and girls " in front of reporters			0
in doing so , he sealed his fate			0
one legislator said that the chairman had " underestimated the intelligence of the people he was talking to			0
we may be @entity111 , but we 're not stupid			0
" the @entity112 concluded , " a revolution has occurred			0
the seniority system as the rigid , inviolable operating framework of the @entity48 has been destroyed			0
" the @entity18 also led the way in instituting changes in rules and regulations			1
working in an alliance with @entity34 who had been in office since the late 1950s , their sunshine laws opened up much more of the legislative process to public and media scrutiny			0
they instituted ethics reforms that created new standards of accountability for politicians in the executive and legislative branches			0
they ensured that the new campaign finance laws required disclosure of information about who gave money to whom , and that the @entity140 was capable of monitoring the laws			1
they reformed the filibuster rules to lower the number of senators required to end a filibuster , from two - thirds to three - fifths of the @entity149 , while providing party leaders more tools so that they could keep members in line ( back then reformers wanted more partisanship , not less )			1
over time , the @entity18 lost much of their zeal for government reform			1
this class of @entity34 eventually focused their attention on policy issues , becoming less interested in cleaning up the political process			1
@entity27 was a pioneer on issues such as the environment and health care , while @entity26 was a legislative giant who fought for programs like the minimum wage while others like @entity172 's @entity171 emphasized public investment in high tech industries and new approaches to defense			0
some of the reforms also did n't work out as they intended			0
but the original focus of the @entity18 is an important legacy and one that we should not forget			1
their central argument that major policy innovations are impossible unless we make the political system better is one that would be worth remembering			1
although president @entity186 made political reform part of his 2008 campaign promises , the issues faded quickly from his agenda			1
nor have the tea party @entity56 , who love to rail against the way that @entity1 works , really devoted much time to questions such as campaign finance			1
rather , their emphasis has been about cutting the government down in size			1
today , reform is urgent			0
we badly need campaign finance rules that impose limits on what independent organizations can spend and lobbying reforms that seriously close the revolving door between @entity82 and the @entity207 lobbying complex			2
without procedural reforms to weaken the power of party leaders , heightened partisanship in the @entity48 and @entity149 wo n't subside			0
without rules to change the budgeting process , the ability of our @entity216 to make decisions about spending and taxation in a more rational process -- one that does not constantly risk default -- will be extraordinarily difficult as well			2
without reforms that make sure continued bastions of secrecy , such as conference committees , open up their doors , there will be ongoing frustration with a lack of accountability in politics			2
as @entity27 and @entity26 step down , it is time to celebrate what they represented in their heyday during the 1970s			0
politicians need to devote some of their capital to strengthening the processes of decision - making and governing			0
that 's vital to restoring trust in government			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			1

@entity246 : the last few reformers elected after @entity18 are retiring
their key *message* : cleaning up government should precede policy changes
@entity246 says @entity186 promised change in 2008 but *largely* *abandoned* the effort
he says @entity8 needs to rein in lobbyists , regulate campaign *donations* , remove secrecy
