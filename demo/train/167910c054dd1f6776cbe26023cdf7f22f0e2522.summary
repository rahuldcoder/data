@entity0 -- a notebook full of work - in - progress versions of some of @entity6 's key poems has been rediscovered more than 70 years after the poet 's mother - in - law ordered it to be burnt			1
the book , in @entity6 's cramped , neat handwriting , includes 19 poems in varying states of completion , some with large sections scratched out and revised , and offers a valuable insight into his creative process			1
hailed as a " terrific discovery " by one leading @entity6 expert , the workbook is set to sell at auction for upwards of Â £ 100,000 ( $ 156,430 ) , capping off the writer 's centenary year and tantalizing poetry scholars around the world			1
@entity6 , one of the leading poets of the @entity27 , is thought to have discarded the notebook during a stay at the home of his mother - in - law , @entity31 , at some point in the late 1930s			1
@entity6 and @entity31 did not get on , and he wrote to a friend of his dislike for both her and the place -- @entity36 in @entity37 -- in southern @entity38			2
" this flat @entity43 country levels the intelligence , planes down the imagination , narrows the a 's , my ears belch up old wax and misremembered passages of misunderstood music , i sit and hate my mother - in - law , glowering at her from corners and grumbling about her in the sad , sticky , quiet of the lavatory			0
" @entity31 gave the workbook to her maid , @entity54 , and told her to dispose of it , but @entity54 opted to save it from the flames , and instead stashed it away for decades			0
a handwritten note from @entity54 on the cover explains : " @entity60 by @entity6 was with a lot of papers given to me to burn in the kitchen boiler			0
i saved it and forgot all about it until i read of his death ... " @entity54 died in 1984 , and the book has remained among her family 's possessions , hidden away in a drawer ever since , and unknown to @entity6 scholars who pore over every other scrap of his work			1
@entity77 , the editor of @entity6 's " @entity78 , " said the discovery was " probably the most significant find since @entity6 's death in 1953 when various papers were bought up , and perhaps even since 1941 , when he sold some of his notebooks to the @entity86			1
" for some of the poems included , we 've never had manuscript versions before , and they show significant changes were made ; most of them are fair copies of finished poems , but some are more like worksheets -- they allow us to see how he arrived at a certain phrase , to see what he 's up to			1
" all the works included eventually made it into print , some in his first collection , " 18 poems , " in 1934 , and the rest in his second anthology , " 25 poems , " in 1936 , which suggests the manuscript dates to a critical point in his life			2
" at this particular period in his career , his works are like abstract paintings or music : everything is about the words , the language -- they 're not anecdotes or narratives , " he explained , adding that @entity6 had likely discarded the notebook because all the poems in it had been published : " he 'd used it up			1
he was always leaving things behind			0
" as literature fans in @entity6 's native @entity129 and around the world celebrate the centenary of his birth , the notebook is being put up for sale at @entity135 's auction house in @entity0 in december , where it is expected to go under the hammer for between Â £ 100,000 and Â £ 150,000 ( $ 156,430 to $ 234,640 )			1
@entity137 , of @entity135 's , said that as a " way of understanding @entity6 's writing process " it was likely to appeal to anyone with a love of his work			2
" it will be very exciting to see where it ends up , " she told @entity1			0
@entity77 , professor of @entity43 language and literature at the @entity148 ( @entity6 's hometown ) said major libraries and university collections around the world would love to own the book			1
" personally , i 'd like to see the @entity154 or the @entity155 put in a bid , to stop it from leaving the country , if possible , " he said			0
the @entity86 , @entity159 , and the @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity162 -- both already home to large @entity6 collections -- may also take an interest , @entity77 added			0
" from my point of view the worst thing would be for it to end up in the hands of a private collector who locks it up in a bank vault for 50 years , " he said , admitting he was desperate to get a closer look at the book after being given a sneak peek ahead of the sale			0
" it was hard to keep my hands off it -- i just want to pore through it , to be able to read every word in his crabbed , backwards - sloping hand -- it is such a covetable object			0
" @entity6 was born in @entity185 , south @entity129 , in 1914 ; he found fame with his " play for voices , " " @entity188 , " and poems including " @entity190 " and " @entity191			2
" @entity6 was also known for his hard - drinking lifestyle			2
he collapsed at @entity159 's @entity193 in 1953 , shortly after reportedly announcing : " i 've had 18 straight whiskies			0
i think that 's the record ! " and died in hospital several days later .			0
