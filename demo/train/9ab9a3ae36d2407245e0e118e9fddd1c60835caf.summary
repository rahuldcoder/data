-- @entity1 was driving along @entity2 on tuesday with his wife when they noticed the minivan driving through shallow water as it headed south			1
but then they heard the screams			2
it was two children crying and waving for help out one of the rear windows			1
@entity1 threw the car in park and raced over to see whether he could get the children out of the minivan			1
one child was screaming , @entity1 recalled wednesday to @entity0 's @entity20			2
" please help us , our mom is trying to kill us			0
" the other child he could see was wrestling a woman for the steering wheel			1
but the woman just kept saying , " we 're ok			1
we 're ok , " as another man joined @entity1 trying to get the driver to stop			0
then she mashed the accelerator , turned left and shot into the cold , heavy surf of the @entity32 touching the shore of the @entity35 city			1
it was now a battle against the pull of the water , and the second man , @entity40 , opened a door and pulled out the two panicked children			1
there was a good chance if he and @entity1 had n't been there , the children , ages 10 and 9 , would have drowned inside the van as it pitched in the water , officials said			1
" i have siblings their age , so it was like the big brother came out in me , " @entity51 said			0
but there was one more child , a 3 - year - old girl strapped in a car seat			0
a lifeguard dove in through a front window and unbuckled the child and handed her to another lifeguard			0
the vehicle was bobbing in water about 3 feet deep			0
the mother just walked away , @entity1 said , silent with a strange , almost " possessed " look on her face			0
a day later she was at a hospital in @entity2 awaiting a mental evaluation , @entity69 sheriff @entity68 said			1
her children , including her unborn baby , were fine			1
no charges had been filed , @entity68 said , as the investigation into why she drove into the ocean was just beginning			0
@entity0 is not identifying the children or the woman , who was stopped earlier in the day after her sister called police to let them know how concerned she was for her sibling 's mental state			1
according to a @entity2 @entity85 report , the woman was stopped by an officer , who questioned her			1
in the back seat the kids sat calmly with smiles			0
the woman told an officer that she feared for her safety and was worried her former husband would harm them			2
but the officer was concerned that she might have a mental illness			2
he asked a detective who was there to talk to her while other officers called the sister back			0
in the report , the officer writes of discussing the woman 's behavior with the detective			2
they came to the same conclusion ; she could n't be held under a @entity35 law that allows for detention of people believed to be impaired by mental illness and who possibly pose a risk of harm			1
they told her she could go ; one officer followed her for a short time			0
almost two hours later , she was driving on the beach , outside the traffic lane , drawing the attention of beach patrol and bystanders like @entity51 and @entity1 , on vacation from @entity121			0
sheriff @entity68 said the children are now in the state 's care			1
they had been interviewed by detectives from his agency , which was taking the lead because it has more investigators than other departments			0
the woman had yet to speak with detectives			2
@entity68 said his team will try to determine whether this was a criminal act or one that resulted from a medical issue			0
no one in his department knows how long the woman had been in town or why she was visiting from @entity139			2
she did have family in the area , the sheriff said			0
police : @entity35 parents charged with abandoning kids had syringes in truck			2
