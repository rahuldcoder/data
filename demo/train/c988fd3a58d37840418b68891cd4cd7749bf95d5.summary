-- pizza joints , sushi bars , " @entity4 " pubs , curry houses and @entity7 restaurants rule in @entity9 's sprawling resort areas , far outnumbering humble @entity9 places			1
but you can find true indigenous dining in urban parts such as @entity14 , @entity15 or @entity16 if you follow groups of determined - looking @entity9 around lunch or dinnertime			1
the search is easier if you head for the hills , to smaller villages with fewer visitors			1
either way , you 'll find menus that blend flavors inherited from @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity31			1
spices such as cumin , cinnamon and coriander enrich many dishes			1
@entity9 cooks also use lots of wild and foraged ingredients , including greens such as kapari ( wild capers ) , the tiny snails called karaoli and game including rabbit , hare and partridge			1
meze time a meze meal is a great way to sample the best of @entity9 food at one sitting			1
meze is n't unique to @entity9 -- the tradition of serving a generous array of small savory dishes is common all over the eastern @entity59 and the @entity31			1
but many of the individual meze dishes you 'll find in @entity9 are peculiar to the island			1
a typical meze table begins with dips such as tahini , pickles , stuffed vine leaves and cold bean salads			2
grilled halloumi cheese will likely follow , along with spicy sausages such as loukanika , often simmered in red wine			0
then comes more meat -- grilled on the spit , skewered or barbecued over charcoal			2
pork gets top billing , but lamb and chicken play supporting roles			0
a meze that mixes fish and meat is heresy , so if you have a yen for something maritime , you must seek out a taverna that specializes in seafood			2
here , the platters will be piled with fried or grilled red mullet , whitebait , shrimp , fried baby squid and octopus or cuttlefish simmered in red wine and spices			0
tip : pacing is essential			0
it 's all too easy to eat your fill from the first round , leaving no room for dishes to follow			2
a great meze comprises at least 20 dishes -- it should take all evening to polish them off			1
top places to spend a meze evening include 7 @entity113 's @entity112 ( @entity114 , @entity115 ; +357 2696 3176 ; reservations essential ) in @entity117 , just a few kilometers from downtown @entity115			2
in @entity16 , many residents say the lountza and haloumi at @entity121 ( @entity122 31 ; +357 2266 2727 ) are the best in town			0
@entity125 yahni the tiny wild snails called karaoli emerge in vast numbers with the autumn rains			0
they 're especially common in the @entity136 peninsula , the island 's wild western tip , where they 're gathered by the bucket - load and served simmered in tomato sauce			0
a good place to try them is at @entity140 ( @entity141 , @entity136 ; +357 2632 2526 ) in the old fashioned stone village of @entity141 , five kilometers south of the fishing harbor at @entity144			0
@entity145 tender young vine leaves are at their best in spring , when they 're used to wrap minced lamb or pork and rice to make this typical snack , served hot or cold			0
in winter , cabbage leaves are used instead of vine leaves			0
@entity154 a glass of @entity9 wine or zivania ( grape spirit ) should rarely be served alone			1
it usually comes accompanied by an assortment of savory dishes -- poikilia			1
among the best are cold cuts such as @entity162 ( sun - cured goat thigh ) , hiromeri ( pork thigh marinated in wine , then pressed and wood - smoked ) or pastourma , @entity9 's take on salt beef			1
@entity168 @entity9 food is n't all about small plates -- hearty eaters will be more than satisfied			1
pork plays a leading role in traditional cuisine , and afelia can claim to be the country 's signature dish			0
lean chunks of pork are marinated in red wine , flavored with cumin , cinnamon and coriander , then simmered in a clay casserole until meltingly tender			0
@entity186 sheftalia are herb - flavored sausages of minced pork or lamb , which often anchor a meze platter but are also served as a meaty main course			2
esteemed for its sausages is @entity195 ( @entity197 village , 12 kilometers north of @entity14 ; +357 2581 3777 ) , the gourmet restaurant at @entity199 , a boutique hotel in a hill village above @entity14			2
@entity202 a dish unique to @entity9 , kolokasi ( taro ) has been grown here since @entity206			1
chunks of taro root are simmered with chicken or pork in a sauce of caramelized tomatoes , onions and celery , spiked with lemon juice and served with olives and radishes			0
it 's also often made without meat for the @entity220 fast			2
oktapodi krasato you 're never far from the sea in @entity9 and seafood restaurants abound			1
many are mediocre , serving farmed and frozen fish to unwary tourists			0
for something distinctively @entity9 , there are places offering dishes such as oktapodi krasato -- chunks of tenderized octopus spiced with coriander and cumin and simmered in red wine			1
@entity237 ( @entity236 37 , @entity15 ; +357 2465 7198 ) , where the seafood comes straight from the little harbor right next door , is a good choice			0
vegetarian dishes the @entity9 menu is meat - heavy , but -- because devout @entity247 @entity246 eschew meat during @entity220 -- there are plenty of veggie options , including anthous ( courgette flowers stuffed with rice and feta cheese ) and louvi me lahana ( black eyed beans served cold with wild greens , oil and lemon juice ) and dips , such as tahini			1
@entity262 ( @entity261 , @entity16 ; +357 2234 9803 ; lunch only ) has a good array of dips , pulses , salads and other vegetarian dishes			2
@entity269 ravioles are part of the culinary legacy left by the @entity273 , who ruled @entity9 from 1489 to 1571			1
similar to @entity277 ravioli , these pasta parcels are stuffed with haloumi cheese , then simmered in chicken broth			0
@entity281 , and filling , they 're especially good at @entity282 ( archbishop @entity283 , @entity16 , +357 224 22860 )			0
@entity284 and so to sweet things			0
@entity286 is the place to find sticky toffee called pasteli that 's still made the old way from the juice pressed from the carob bean			2
it 's known as mavros chrysos ( " black gold " )			0
the @entity295 ( daily , 8 a.m. -5 p.m. ; +357 2522 2357 ) tells the story of carob growing in @entity9 , and you can sample and buy pasteli and other carob items in the nearby @entity300 ( +357 2522 1500 )			1
@entity0 @entity302 series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			0
however , @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity9 cooking blends flavors from @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity31
but fast food joints far outnumber indigenous eateries in the resorts
you can find the real deal in the hill villages -- a meze meal provides up to 20 little dishes to try
