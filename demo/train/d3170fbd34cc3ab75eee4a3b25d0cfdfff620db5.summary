-- @entity2 's 2007 album with pop - bluegrass songbird @entity3 , @entity5 , did something 25 years of solo records never quite managed			1
it fully transformed him from former @entity10 golden god into a roots singer			1
@entity2 had never sung so tenderly or collaboratively , commanding a crack modern string band that defined power in terms other than " @entity15 "			1
" @entity17 " -- named after @entity2 's first band with late pal @entity19 -- smartly takes some cues from " @entity5			1
" plant uses an a list of country voices and players ( @entity24 , @entity25 ) and an inspired mix of vintage and modern songs			0
if it 's not quite as seamless and sublime a record , well , it 's pretty damn good , and what it lacks in coherence it makes up for in magnified rock & roll mojo			1
@entity25 helps with the latter			0
the journeyman guitarist - songwriter ( and former @entity38 collaborator ) co-produced the record with @entity2 , and he contributes muscular playing and singing			1
his guitar is low and nasty on the lead cut , a coiled , mandolin - dusted cover of @entity46 ' " @entity45			0
" and he opens up on " @entity47 , " a cover of @entity50 's scalding 1978 folk rocker , bright leads carving the air while @entity2 and @entity54 's harmonies recall @entity10 's " @entity55			1
" but what 's most striking is @entity2 's vocal versatility			1
as a solo act , his songwriting has been spotty , if impressively versatile			0
but he 's proved himself to be an excellent interpreter , from his 1984 " @entity62 " ep of old - school r&b and pop through @entity5			1
he does the same here , and the songs give him plenty to work with			0
he returns to the late , great @entity65 ( whose " @entity66 ' " was a highlight on @entity68 ) for the bleak " @entity69 , " working a metaphor that turns the idea of time into a woman beyond a man 's control			2
plant does n't oversing a whit , delivering poetic meditations on mortality with @entity54 's harmonies clinging to him like a spangled death shroud			2
the two most striking songs are the most left - field , both penned by the brooding husband - wife indie - rock band @entity82			2
" @entity94 " is a glittering dirge , another showcase for @entity54 , who 's such a good songwriter that 's it 's easy to forget what a great singer she is			2
plant sings " monkey " almost as a whisper			0
" it 's a suicide / shut up and drive , " he snarls , in what sounds like the opening scene of a @entity102 film			2
it 's as menacingly restrained as anything he 's ever uttered			2
this is a record primarily about loss and time 's march , and @entity2 sings with gravity , working his middle range			1
it does n't all click			0
" @entity117 " tries too hard for profundity			0
and the old spiritual " @entity122 " mostly makes you want to hear @entity2 back cruising @entity120 's daughter on " @entity121			1
" but @entity2 is n't singing like the old days			1
the closest he comes is " @entity126 , " first recorded in 1965 by @entity125 singer @entity124			0
plant knocks it out playfully , like a lost demo from @entity130 , with a few hollers and sexy woo - oh - ohs			0
and in 3:10 , it 's over			2
you ca n't buy his love , and you ca n't turn back time			0
it 's a notion other rock vets could do well to ponder			0
