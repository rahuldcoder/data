-- elected with the largest margin of victory in the history of @entity6 's presidential elections , president @entity1 is aiming to bring the good times back to @entity6 while looking to a friendlier future with @entity9			1
smiling through it : president @entity1 has some tough challenges ahead			0
winning 58 percent of the vote , @entity1 was swept to victory on the promise of economic growth but through the more controversial method of building closer ties with @entity9			1
with the backdrop of economic depression @entity1 's calls to reinvigorate the economy by freer trade and improved relations with @entity9 proved stronger than the fears that those ties could lead to a loss in independence			1
nevertheless , with a message of rapprochement , the charismatic former mayor of @entity29 has a tough job on his hands in his first presidency			0
born in @entity35 in 1950 , @entity1 studied at @entity36 and worked as a lawyer in @entity38 in 1981 before returning @entity6			2
he held a number of posts in government ministries from 1988 , including minister for justice for three years from 1993			0
however , it was not until he was elected mayor of @entity29 in 1998 that he emerged as a potential future president , and he was elected as chairman of the @entity47 , @entity6 's @entity47 party , in july 2005			1
yet having built up a solid reputation in @entity6 's notoriously volatile political culture , his image was tarnished by allegations of corruption while mayor of @entity29 in 2006			1
it was alleged that he had misappropriated around $ 340,000 , and after resigning his position as head of the @entity47 to fight the charges , he was finally cleared of all allegations in 2007			0
with a clear mandate and popular support he occupies a unique position in @entity63 politics ; @entity64 has said he is in the rare position of being a politician who has the " opportunity to shape the destiny not only of their own nation but also of an entire region			0
" moving swiftly to build stronger links , the first regular direct flights for nearly 60 years between @entity9 and @entity29 resumed on july 4			0
@entity1 's administration hopes that @entity9 tourists from the mainland will boost the sluggish tourism industry and talks are already underway to increase the number of weekly flights			2
in a further signal of d√©tente , @entity82 province in @entity9 has offered the @entity6 port city of @entity87 two white tigers as a symbol of improved relations			2
allaying fears , breaking down generations of mistrust and making @entity6 's economy roar again will be the considerable challenges of @entity1 's administration ; the former barrister will have to use all his negotiating skills to try and fulfill his ambitions .			1

@entity6 's *premier* , @entity1 , elected by biggest margin in history
has promised to bring economic *prosperity* back to @entity6 and engage @entity9
*hugely* *difficult* task ahead of *strengthening* ties with @entity9 and allaying *public* fears
