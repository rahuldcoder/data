-- keeping up with the changes in coaching personnel on the men 's tennis tour can be difficult these days			1
" when i came into the locker room , i see the guys , " explains the 2001 @entity7 champion			0
" i thought i might be mistaken			0
are we on the @entity11 ? ! " the @entity13 's tongue - in - cheek remark made at the start of the @entity15 serves to illustrate a novel situation where former grand slam winners are suddenly all the rage with today 's top players			1
@entity5 -- coach to compatriot @entity21 since 2010 -- and @entity22 ( who has been with @entity23 since 2011 ) are old hands compared to the likes of @entity26 and @entity27 , who surprised everyone at the end of last year when they accepted roles with @entity32 and @entity33 respectively			1
the @entity34 and the @entity35 met 35 times in the 1980s and 1990s , famously contesting three consecutive @entity7 finals			2
@entity27 won that particular battle 2 - 1 with both men finishing their careers with six grand slam titles			1
but how will they fair as coaches ? @entity44 , a former rival of both and host of @entity0 's @entity48 , admitted to " surprise and disbelief " when he got wind of @entity26 's appointment			1
he was n't the only one			0
" when @entity32 announced that @entity26 was going to be working with him i was honestly very surprised for a couple of reasons , " two - time @entity55 champion @entity54 told @entity0			1
" @entity32 had such a strong fall -- he was undefeated since the final of the @entity55 where he lost to @entity60			1
he was 24 - 0 in the fall , so he was playing so well , " she added			0
" the other thing that came to mind was that i was surprised @entity26 wanted to do it			2
he seems to have such a full life with family and commentary			0
it 's a big commitment to travel on tour with a player full - time			2
but it seems like @entity26 is really , really excited about doing it			2
" excited and confident , judging by his comments prior to the @entity15			0
" i 've been in 10 grand slam finals , i know exactly what a player feels like when he 's in the later stages of a tournament , " @entity26 told reporters			1
" when you 're 25 -- in my case -- i was better with a tennis racket and now i 'm better with my mouth			0
" net gains @entity32 has retained the services of long - time coach @entity87 , but will be hoping to learn from @entity26 's much feted skills at the net , @entity54 thinks			1
it was here , after all , that the @entity34 made a name for himself during a 15 - year career , winning thousands of points and millions of fans with his unique brand of athleticism and never - say - die attitude			2
" ( @entity32 ) already has that from the baseline -- great defense , great offense -- but maybe he wants to round out his game a little bit more and be more forceful at the net , maybe have some better technique at the net , " she says			2
retired doubles ace @entity109 is more familiar than most with @entity32 's game			1
the @entity112 , who won 11 grand slam doubles titles with his partner @entity116 , coached the world no. 2 for a time in 2007			0
" he likes to evolve his game and take advice from great tennis players and obviously he 's gone for one of the all - time greats in @entity26 , " @entity109 said			1
" i just wonder whether in the back of @entity32 's mind is the way @entity26 played -- trying to finish points a little more cleanly than what he 's been doing in the past			1
" maybe he 's trying to pick up on the style that @entity26 brought to the court himself -- the knowledge , the hustle bustle			1
you 've got to think that the elongated points that he has to play these days , it 's got to mount up			2
" long points inevitably lead to long games , as @entity32 's fans in @entity140 are all too aware			1
in 2012 he clinched his third title beating @entity60 in a match lasting five hours 53 minutes -- the longest grand slam final ever -- and last year he took just over five hours to get past @entity144 in the fourth round			0
however , the @entity147 's three - year @entity15 reign came to an end against @entity144 on tuesday as the @entity149 upset the odds to win a grueling four - hour clash and reach the semifinals			0
while @entity32 tries to transition from baseline to net , @entity26 is plotting an entirely new path away from the commentary box			1
the 46 - year - old has reigned in his tv duties since accepting the coaching role , but his former @entity161 coach @entity160 has urged @entity26 , whose private life since retiring in 1999 has been colorful and , at times , scandalous , to go a step further			1
" there is no doubt he needs to change his lifestyle completely , " @entity160 said , @entity165 reported			0
" he needs strict discipline and a certain modesty			0
it wo n't be easy for him but he has no choice			0
" he should not give too many interviews , must be restrained and do his work quietly			0
above all , he must understand that he is not more important than the player			0
it will be an interesting experiment			0
" can @entity177 help @entity178 ? whereas @entity26 and @entity32 's partnership has caused a degree of head - scratching , the news that @entity33 had sought out the services of @entity27 was much easier to understand			1
" that one did n't surprise me , " says @entity54			0
" he looks up to @entity27			2
he was one of his idols			0
@entity33 , when he first came on tour , to me , would serve and volley and infrequently chip and charge , and now he does n't do that as much			1
of course , that was @entity27 's style of play , so maybe he 's looking for that little extra element to elevate his game			1
" @entity27 , now 48 , has agreed to a part - time coaching role , spending 10 weeks with @entity33 this season , but is confident he can help the 32 - year - old @entity149 to an 18th grand slam title			1
" he 's such a great player , but there 's always minor things you can work on , " @entity27 said recently			1
" that 's why i do it , because i really think i can make a little difference			0
and if i can make a little difference , maybe that will take him back to where he was			0
" @entity109 is relishing the prospect of watching the partnership evolve			2
" we all liked to watch @entity27 play			2
it 's almost when we watch @entity33 play now , everyone covets to see him			1
they always want him to win , " @entity109 said			2
" i 'm looking forward to seeing how @entity33 profits from that			2
i think it 's going to be so beneficial for him because that is probably that style is probably what @entity33 needs to move towards if he is going to have an elongated career			1
" fine margins with the business end of the year 's first grand slam approaching , @entity33 will hope he can execute the strategies discussed with @entity27 as he takes on @entity23 -- his successor as @entity7 champion last year -- in wednesday 's quarterfinals			1
" the key thing for me is that this really shows how important these tiny little things can make , " says @entity54			0
" these are all champions that we are talking about , they 're already top players , but they are looking for any different margin to set themselves apart			0
" in a match when they are playing against each other , it could be two or three points			0
it could be something that a former champion says -- the light bulb goes and maybe makes them feel more comfortable , more confident			0
if that makes the difference then it 's all worth it			0
