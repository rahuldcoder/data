" my work is based on the idea of country , " he said			0
" all countries around the world should be sacred			0
i hate the situation in @entity5 because @entity5 should be sacred as well			2
i do n't want the country to be ruined			0
" because i live without a country , it makes me feel closer to people who are suffering here			0

it makes me closer to understanding their pain			0
" @entity1 's said he feels his identity split between his @entity8 heritage and his parents ' adopted country			1
