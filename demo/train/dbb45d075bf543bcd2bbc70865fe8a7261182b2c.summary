@entity1 secretary of state @entity0 said sunday after four hours of talks with @entity4 foreign minister @entity3 that @entity4 had reaffirmed its commitment to finding a diplomatic solution in @entity7 but had not agreed to move @entity4 troops from the @entity7 border			1
" we both made suggestions as to how that will be achieved ... and i will return to @entity16 to consult with president @entity17 on his choices , " @entity0 said at a news conference in @entity11			1
" we are trying to find a way to defuse this			0
" in a later press briefing , @entity3 said , " we expressed differing views about the cause of this crisis but nevertheless we agreed on the need to search for points of common ground to find a diplomatic settlement			1
" @entity0 said @entity3 indicated @entity4 " wants to support " @entity7 in its move toward independence but said the massing of @entity4 troops has created " a climate of fear and intimidation			1
" " is it smart at this moment in time to have that number of troops amassed on a border when you are sending a message that you want to de-escalate and move in the other direction ? " @entity0 said			1
@entity0 said @entity4 and the @entity1 agreed to work with @entity7 on several issues : the rights of national minorities ; language rights ; the demobilization and disarmament of provocateurs ; a constitutional reform process ; and free and fair elections monitored by the international community			1
@entity3 said he hopes " all political forces in @entity7 will have an equal voice and can agree on which kind of concrete political , economic , financial , social , religious traditions will be respected in different parts of the country			0
" @entity0 stressed that no real progress can be made until the troops are pulled back			2
he added that @entity7 must be part of any discussions going forward , saying , " no decisions about @entity7 without @entity7			0
" other nations support this stance , he said			0
hours before the meeting , @entity3 called on @entity69 powers to back a proposal for a " federal " structure in @entity7			0
" if our @entity69 partners are prepared , @entity4 , the @entity1 and the @entity74 will be able to set up a group of support to @entity7 and to formulate general appeals to those who rule in @entity7 now , " @entity3 told @entity4 state television , according to state news agency @entity73			1
this would lead to talks between " all political forces without exception , naturally not armed radicals " and would result in a new constitution allowing for a " federal system of government , " he said			0
" if our partners are prepared for this , we are open for broadest cooperation , " @entity3 added			0
@entity0 said that subject was not discussed with @entity3 because it 's a decision @entity7 's leaders must make			2
with millions of @entity4 speakers concentrated in @entity7 's eastern regions , @entity4 backs the idea of greater regional autonomy			2
this would " protect the rights of those who live in @entity7 , primarily the @entity4 - speaking population , which is important to us , " @entity3 said			2
@entity3 and @entity0 met for four hours in @entity11 on sunday , as both sides tried to ease tensions in the worst @entity106 standoff since the @entity107			1
the meeting ended about 5 p.m. et. ' the hordes are coming ' : @entity7 fear @entity4 invasion in northeast @entity4 forces on border the meeting follows a phone call between @entity4 president @entity116 and @entity1 president @entity17 on friday			1
" what gives me a sense we may be able to solve the situation is that @entity116 did call our president and suggestions were made , and there will be a meeting ( between @entity0 and @entity3 ) , " sen. @entity118 , chairwoman of the @entity119 , told @entity129 's " @entity128 " on sunday			1
" and there may well be the ability to solve this			0
" on saturday , @entity3 said @entity4 had no intention of sending troops into @entity7 -- responding to @entity69 warnings over a military buildup on the border following @entity139 's annexation of the @entity141 peninsula			1
@entity142 voted march 16 to break away from @entity7 and join @entity4			2
the @entity1 and other @entity69 governments called the referendum illegal , saying it violated @entity7 's constitution and amounted to an attempt by @entity4 to expand its borders to the @entity149 peninsula			1
@entity4 may have 40,000 troops near its border with eastern @entity7 and another 25,000 at locations inland who are on alert and prepared to go in , two @entity1 officials have told @entity129			1
the officials said that this estimate was largely based on satellite imagery and that a firm number is difficult to assess			0
@entity4 has said its troops are carrying out snap military exercises in the region			0
the @entity1 and the @entity74 have targeted members of @entity116 's inner circle with two rounds of sanctions that include visa bans and asset freezes			0
the @entity168 has warned more sanctions are possible if @entity4 sends more forces into @entity7			2
@entity4 responded with its own sanctions on the @entity1 , banning several @entity1 officials from entering the country			2
opinion : does @entity17 really understand @entity116 ? @entity1 defense secretary @entity174 ordered the top @entity1 commander in @entity176 back to the continent because of the " growing uncertainty in @entity7 , " @entity180 press secretary @entity179			1
gen. @entity182 was in @entity16 , where he was supposed to give annual testimony before @entity184 later this week			0
" more broadly , he felt it was important for @entity190 to continue our efforts to consult with @entity194 allies , and to discuss specific ways to provide additional reassurance for our @entity194 allies in @entity176 , " @entity181 said of @entity186 's decision to cut short @entity182 's stay in @entity16			0
" while it does not foreshadow imminent military action in @entity7 , the general 's return will allow him more time to confer closely with his staff and our allies and partners , and to better advise senior leaders , " @entity181 said			0
