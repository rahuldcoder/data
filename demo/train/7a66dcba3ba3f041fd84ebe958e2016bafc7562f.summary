-- " even if you know the way , " an ancient @entity2 proverb advises , " ask one more time			1
" if @entity2 's latest cycle of misdeeds , followed by international censure , followed by menacing words out of @entity10 has a familiar ring to it , it is because this behavior has become a fixture of the accordion - like rhythm of @entity17 security			1
but a familiar path is not the same thing as a prudent one			2
it would be a mistake to let @entity2 's young leader think he has inherited the family license to provoke with immunity			1
let 's briefly retrace the recent cycle of provocation , sanction and threat			0
on december 12 , @entity2 successfully launched a three - stage @entity32 rocket			1
although an @entity34 ( @entity35 - 3 ) was placed into orbit , the ostensibly peaceful launch simultaneously advanced the @entity2 's long - range missile program that would put @entity39 territory into target range			1
the triumphant launch came eight months after a similar rocket shattered over the @entity43			0
@entity32 can reach at least @entity44 now and most likely will be able to reach @entity45 and @entity46 and the @entity47 of the continental @entity39 within the coming year or two			0
adding a workable nuclear warhead will take a bit longer , perhaps three or more years , based on available information			2
the launch also delivered a success on the first anniversary of @entity55 's death , conferring precious credibility on @entity58 's fledgling regime			0
on january 22 , the @entity60 @entity59 unanimously passed @entity61			0
the resolution strengthens existing sanctions , curbing the travel and potentially the finances of the agencies and senior officials responsible for the rocket launch			2
resolution 2087 marks a proportionate response to a specific infraction , as the april and december rocket launches violated previous @entity59 resolutions enacted after the @entity75 's 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests			1
the latest resolution leaves open a diplomatic path			0
it encourages @entity2 to rejoin @entity79 with @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and the @entity39 , aimed at realizing @entity10 's official pledge of september 19 , 2005 , to move toward total denuclearization			1
but the @entity60 measure also signals a " significant determination " to impose harsher measures in the event of a third nuclear test			2
@entity10 's verbal reaction to sanctions has been swift and purposeful			0
declaring sanctions to be tantamount to " a declaration of war , " @entity2 is threatening further missile and nuclear tests			1
@entity97 is conveniently aimed at the @entity2 's " sworn enemy " the @entity39 , as the @entity100 administration transitions its national security team for a second term			1
just as @entity82 president - elect @entity104 seeks to instigate a more peaceful @entity106 relationship , the @entity2 regime appears to quash that initiative before it gets off the ground			1
@entity58 himself may be threatened by the mere prospect of a summit with @entity82 's @entity112			0
@entity114 's economic prosperity and strong democratic institutions stand in stark contrast to those of @entity2 , which appears incapable of abandoning its stereotypical ways , including the economic dead - end of a military - first policy			1
despite a well - trodden history of provocation , sanction and threat , the @entity2 's latest threats should not be sloughed off as insignificant			1
@entity2 's next nuclear test may well pave the way for a sizeable expansion of its nuclear arsenal			1
if its clandestine uranium - enrichment program has made strides , @entity10 could demonstrate that it will gain access to a far larger pool of fissile material than simply its limited supply of weapons - grade plutonium			0
a larger pool of fissile material is a dual threat : as a vital part of an expanded nuclear weapon program and as a commodity to be sold on the black market			0
beyond the obvious goal of regime survival , burgeoning nuclear and missile programs may be changing @entity2 's tolerance for risk			1
in the space of a year , @entity58 has struck a nuclear and missile moratorium with the @entity39 ( the so - called " @entity154 " deal ) , quickly abandoned that agreement , launched two long - range rockets in contravention of international law , and now is prepared for a third nuclear test at the @entity161 nuclear test facility in the northeast			1
nuclear test number three could be conducted any time , from the next few days to the coming weeks or months			0
with a successful test , @entity10 could in effect proclaim itself invulnerable , above the law , a nuclear - weapon state immune from international action			0
to allow such a misconception to become deeply engrained in the psyche of a leader not thought to be yet 30 years of age would be a grave mistake			0
at some point , a leaky defensive containment policy reaches a tipping point when the penalties of continuing it outweigh the gains of preserving it			0
thus , the familiar path eventually becomes the wrong one			0
the world should be close to reaching that conclusion , and @entity2 should begin to wonder when its luck will run out and it conducts one provocation too many			1
above all else , the @entity39 and its allies and partners need to fashion more offensive policy tools that exact steeper penalties for @entity2 transgressions			1
shifting from defensive to offensive containment requires the @entity39 , @entity82 and @entity83 to augment their defensive posture , through improved and more integrated intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance			0
@entity83 and @entity82 space launches may indicate such steps are under way			0
in the event of a nuclear test , these steps should include the procurement and deployment of the latest ballistic missile defenses			1
additional steps can be taken to reinforce the @entity209 maritime border west of the peninsula , the @entity211 that was the site of both armed clashes in 2010 , and the general state of readiness for a range of provocations			0
beyond military steps , however , there needs to be corresponding legal , economic , political and social consequences for the @entity2 's leadership			2
while stopping far short of seeking regime change in @entity2 , the @entity39 , @entity82 and others could help flood @entity2 with radio and electronic information			2
for instance , it could begin by letting @entity2 know about the costs of its military - first extravagances			2
it could also let more @entity2 know about some of the extensive foreign financial holdings of the @entity2 leadership			2
last week , @entity2 's official news agency opined that , " a nuclear test is what the people demand			1
" if it 's popular sentiment that the @entity2 wants to satisfy ( given the supposed indigenous demand for a nuclear test ) , then the world ought to oblige @entity2 by providing information censored by the regime that could prompt different types of popular demands			1
because escalatory steps must eventually either climb back down or lead to war , there should be a continuing willingness to talk with @entity2 and , should it ever shift tack and commit responsible acts , the @entity39 and its allies should be prepared to reward those acts with more fruitful exchanges and assistance			2
one aim of offensive containment is to move @entity80 from talking about pressure on @entity2 to taking effective action to rein in its ally			2
admittedly , these steps are probably bolder than what is currently in fashion in @entity263 or @entity114			0
some officials may feel paralyzed			0
perhaps they believe that even a deteriorating status quo is preferable to a heightened risk of sudden change			0
but sudden change is not foreordained by getting tougher , whereas certain changeâ € ” more fissile material , more potential nuclear and missile know - how that can be sold under our noses to the bidders in the tumultuous @entity273 and even to @entity275 terrorist cellsâ € ” becomes more likely every day @entity2 moves forward with its mass - destruction technologies			1
in sum , although @entity2 is taking the world down a familiar path , key officials need to ask anew whether the familiar path is still the best one			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity287 .			0

@entity2 has threatened more missile and nuclear tests
@entity292 says the threats came in response to *reasonable* sanctions imposed on @entity2
he says it may be prudent to show @entity2 that such provocations wo *n't* succeed
