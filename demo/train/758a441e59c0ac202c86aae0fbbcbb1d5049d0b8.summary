several @entity4 customers are reporting on online forums that they were able to get up to $ 10 per month knocked off their bills because they threatened to leave the satellite tv company over the fact that @entity10 programming is no longer available for @entity4 customers			1
" wow they must like me , i got $ 10 off per month for 12 months , @entity13 for free for 6 months , and @entity14 for $ 99			1
so i come out $ 20 ahead after a year , " one commenter wrote on a forum on the site @entity18			0
" all i did was say i 'd like to cancel due to the @entity10 dispute			1
i was not expecting to get all that thrown at me			0
" a dispute between satellite provider @entity4 and the media company @entity10 led late tuesday to nearly 20 million customers losing access to 26 @entity10 channels , including @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity30 has more information on the dispute : " @entity10 is seeking a 30 % increase , or $ 1 billion more than its previous deal , @entity4 said in a statement			1
@entity10 countered that its proposed increase totals ' a couple of pennies per day per subscriber			2
' disputes between media companies and cable or satellite tv providers have become increasingly common , but this one is hitting an especially wide audience			0
" @entity4 announced that it would give its subscribers free access to premium @entity48 channels this month to show appreciation for their loyalty			1
" to thank you for your patience until @entity10 channels are returned , all eight @entity54 ( including @entity55 ) will be made available to all customers thru july 31st , " the company wrote wednesday on its @entity53 page			1

in response to a question about whether the company is offering deals to customers who threaten to leave , a spokesman said only that @entity4 is " always willing to work with our customers to keep them happy			1

" they appreciate that we are fighting on their behalf to keep their bills at an acceptable level			0
" several forums reported relatively long wait times for people who placed calls to @entity4			2

@entity30 tech reporter @entity104 said he called the company to complain about his service and was offered a deal similar to those being discussed in the online forums			2
" i figured with the @entity10 thing , @entity4 might be extra amenable to giving me a deal , " he wrote in an e-mail			1
