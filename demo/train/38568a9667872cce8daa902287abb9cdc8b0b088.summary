-- @entity1 was by his wife 's side when she gave birth to their son @entity5 seven years ago , and he was right there holding @entity9 's hand when their younger sons @entity12 and @entity13 were born , too			1
@entity1 was there when @entity9 gave birth to ( from left ) @entity5 , @entity12 and @entity13 , but will probably miss no. 4			2
@entity9 is now eight months pregnant , but when this baby is born , her husband will most likely be more than 300 miles away			2
the reason : their local hospital in @entity21 , @entity22 , wo n't deliver the @entity24 ' baby vaginally as the @entity24 wish , so a week or so before her november 21 due date , @entity9 will drive 350 miles to be near a hospital in @entity27 that will			1
their local hospital says they 'll only deliver the @entity24 ' baby , another boy , via caesarean section			1
@entity9 had her second son , @entity12 , by c - section			1
@entity33 says it wo n't do a vaginal birth after a woman has had a c - section -- known as a @entity37 -- because it has a higher than usual risk for complications			1
so @entity9 plans to move to @entity27 in november , while @entity1 stays in @entity21 , in far northern @entity22 , to take care of their three children and run the family computer business			2
" i 'm so upset about this , " @entity1 says			0
" i 've been there in the delivery room for all the other boys and i wo n't be there for this baby , and i wo n't be there for @entity9			2
" the @entity51 and a growing number of other families are facing the choice of @entity55 having a surgery she does n't want or attempting a vaginal birth at a hospital that , in most cases , would be far away			1
a mother 's choice the @entity24 ' story began in 2004 when she was in labor with @entity12			1
complications arose and doctors at @entity66 feared the baby was n't getting enough oxygen , and so they performed an emergency caesarean section			1
" i 'm grateful for that c - section , " @entity9 says			1
" it saved @entity12 's life			2
" two years later , @entity73 had a successful , uncomplicated vaginal delivery with son @entity13 at the same hospital			0
she assumed she could have a vaginal birth this time too , but , she says , a month ago her doctor told her @entity33 had changed its policy and she 'd have to have a c - section			1
studies have shown vbacs carry with them an increased risk of a uterine rupture compared with births in women who 've never had a c - section , but the risk is less than 1 percent , according to the @entity88			1
the results of a uterine rupture can be devastating : the baby could die or have permanent brain damage			0
" i know there 's a risk with a @entity37 , but we think the risks of surgery are worse , " @entity73 says			0
c - section risks include breathing problems for the baby and infections and bleeding for the mother , according to the @entity103			1
" and i do n't want to have to recover from surgery when i 'll have four children at home , at least not voluntarily , " says @entity9			0
after their discussion with their doctor , the @entity24 made an appointment to speak with @entity33 's ceo , @entity110			2
when the couple told her about their desire for a vaginal birth , they say @entity110 would not budge , even telling them she would get a court order if necessary to ensure @entity9 delivered via c - section			1
" i was a bit flabbergasted , because that seemed rather extreme , " @entity9 says			0
" i 'd already had a vbac at page and it went fine			0
and if something happened , i know they can do an emergency c - section , because they did one for @entity12			1
" conflict over guidelines @entity124 , a spokeswoman for the hospital , said @entity126 could not comment on her discussion with the @entity24 because of patient confidentiality laws			2
@entity129 , which owns @entity33 , says it decided to stop performing vbacs at @entity21 when @entity88 , the obstetricians ' group , established guidelines for hospitals that @entity33 was not adequately staffed to satisfy			1
the @entity88 guidelines recommend " 24/7 coverage of both physician and anesthesiologist , " and that " two physicians be immediately available during the entire period of labor , " @entity129 said in a statement			0
but @entity88 spokesman @entity142 says that 's not what the guidelines say			2
" these appear to be @entity148 's interpretations of the stated recommendation , " says @entity142			0
the @entity88 guidelines recommend that doctors consider several factors when determining if a vbac is possible			0
for example , two criteria that can be considered are whether there 's physician availability throughout active labor , and whether anesthesia and staff can be available for an emergency c - section			1
since the @entity88 guidelines came out in 2004 , more and more hospitals have refused to do @entity161			1
today , nearly half of hospitals wo n't do @entity164 , either because the hospital has banned them or because doctors wo n't do them , according to a survey of nearly 3,000 hospitals by the @entity169 , a grassroots group that has fought against vbac bans			1
missing his son 's birth to get around the ban , @entity73 plans on moving to an apartment in @entity27 in the middle of november			1
they have no friends or family there , but a doula , or childbirth assistant , will drive her to the hospital when she goes into labor			0
the @entity24 have no option but to separate to get the birth they want , but in other situations , women do n't have to go to such extremes			2
for example , some women do n't want to be induced into labor , or do n't want an episiotomy			0
the key is to look around for a doctor or midwife who shares your philosophy by asking questions about their induction rate , or whether they perform episiotomies routinely , according to @entity203 , director of programs for the @entity204 , a nonprofit advocacy and education group			1
also , choosing the right hospital or birthing center makes a big difference			0
" the institution you walk into profoundly affects you , " @entity210 says			0
" a really good thing is to ask doulas for their recommendations , because they 've worked at multiple hospitals and have a good feel for what happens in each of them			0
" for more information on getting the birth you want , see these recommendations from @entity224			0
the @entity24 know there 's little chance @entity1 will make it in time for the birth			2
" with our other sons , her labor only lasted three hours			0
it 'll take me five hours to get to @entity27 , " @entity1 says , noting that with three little kids along for the ride , it will take even longer			0
" of course i 'm scared that i wo n't be there , " he adds			0
" it 's my job as the dad to make sure the baby 's ok after the birth , to follow him around and make sure he has 10 fingers and 10 toes			2
now the chances of that happening are slim to none			0
" @entity0 's @entity244 contributed to this report .			0
