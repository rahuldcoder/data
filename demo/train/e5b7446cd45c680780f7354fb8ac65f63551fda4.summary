it is the home base of the @entity48 , an organization that has sought to force its conservative version of @entity192 in @entity5			2
the group has battled @entity5 troops and , on a number of occasions , attacked civilians as well			2
@entity4 , an ancient city of more than 3 million people tucked right up against the @entity199 , has often found itself in the center of it all			0
