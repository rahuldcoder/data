-- @entity2 's perfect start to the @entity4 season came to a halt on saturday when the defending champions were held to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity8			1
@entity2 had won five matches in a row , and took the lead through a superb individual goal from midfielder @entity13 in the 27th minute as the @entity15 international waltzed into the box and drilled in a low shot			2
however , the industrious home side never gave up and claimed a point against the 19 - time @entity21 champions for the first time in the @entity4 thanks to a 52nd - minute header from big - money august signing @entity24			2
the lanky former @entity28 striker got between central defenders @entity29 and @entity31 to nod home from a corner as @entity2 goalkeeper @entity34 was left helpless on his line			2
@entity2 went into the match without @entity38 striker @entity37 , who wrote on @entity39 that he expects to return from injury for tuesday 's @entity42 visit by @entity44 side @entity43			0
his regular forward partner @entity45 is a doubt for that match after coming off in the first half against @entity8 having fallen hard on his head when he tumbled following a tussle with @entity51 as the @entity52 sought to score			2
that left @entity2 with last season 's top scorer @entity54 up front alongside @entity56 , who scored twice in midweek in the @entity57 but failed to make the same impression			2
@entity54 was similarly ineffectual and was later replaced by @entity59 as @entity2 battled in vain to win the match			0
the result left @entity2 on 16 points , above local rivals @entity63 only on goal difference			1
city earlier briefly topped the table as second - half goals from substitutes @entity69 and @entity70 ended @entity72 's run of victories in their last four visits to @entity75			1
@entity69 broke the deadlock in the 68th minute after replacing @entity77 , with his shot taking a deflection off @entity72 defender @entity80			0
the @entity81 then set up @entity82 , whose effort was ruled out for offside -- and the @entity85 playmaker also earlier hit the woodwork			0
@entity82 provided @entity8 's second with a minute to play as he sent @entity38 midfielder @entity70 clear after an error by @entity72 's former @entity90 winger @entity89 , who came on as a substitute			1
@entity69 's return to form will give manager @entity94 a selection dilemma ahead of tuesday 's @entity42 trip to @entity97			0
meanwhile , @entity98 was both hero and villain as third - placed @entity100 beat promoted @entity101 4 - 1			1
the @entity103 striker scored his second goal in two games after a long drought to put the @entity108 side ahead on the half hour , but was sent off before halftime for a bad tackle on @entity110 -- his first red card in the @entity4			0
it was another mixed weekend for the $ 80 million former @entity114 player , who also netted in the 3 - 1 defeat at @entity2 before an extraordinary miss that saw him widely lampooned			1
@entity118 had already made it 2 - 0 before @entity98 departed , and the @entity121 midfielder doubled his tally in the 76th minute before @entity101 defender @entity123 headed in @entity110 's freekick			1
substitute @entity125 sealed victory deep into stoppage time to boost his hopes of starting in wednesday 's @entity42 trip to @entity130			0
@entity131 retained fourth place with a 3 - 1 victory over @entity134 , who remained in the relegation zone			1
@entity138 striker @entity137 scored his first hat - trick in @entity21 football before being replaced by @entity142 midfielder @entity141 , who made his league comeback after almost a year out with a broken leg			1
fifth - placed @entity114 bounced back from the 4 - 0 trouncing at @entity28 by beating mid-table @entity146 2 - 1 at home			1
@entity148 was sent off last weekend but this time his 11th - minute shot produced an own - goal by defender @entity151 , and striker @entity152 made it 2 - 0 before halftime			0
substitute striker @entity154 gave @entity155 hope four minutes after the break , but @entity158 's team held on as @entity38 midfielder @entity159 continued his comeback from long - term injury when he was introduced late in the match			0
@entity28 closed to within a point of @entity114 , having played one fewer match , after a 2 - 1 win at @entity166			1
new signing @entity167 set up @entity170 midfielder @entity169 in just the third minute , then @entity171 headed home @entity173 's 23rd - minute corner to make it 2 - 0			0
striker @entity176 reduced the deficit five minutes after halftime but @entity166 defender @entity179 was sent off for a second booking for a foul on winger @entity171 as @entity28 held on for a third successive victory			0
@entity183 moved out of the relegation zone and up to 12th place with a 3 - 0 win over 10 - man @entity187 that left the visitors rock bottom after five successive defeats			0
@entity193 's second - half double gave the @entity170 forward 100 goals for the @entity108 club , while @entity196 curled home late on			0
@entity187 had defender @entity198 sent off with the score at 1 - 0 after tugging back @entity38 forward @entity200 , who later limped off			1
@entity201 and @entity202 remained in the bottom four after a 0 - 0 draw at the @entity204 which left the visiting @entity108 side still seeking a first victory this season .			2

@entity2 drop first points of @entity21 season with 1 - 1 draw at @entity8
@entity2 head table on goal difference from rivals @entity63 , who beat @entity72
third - placed @entity100 beat @entity101 as @entity98 scores and is sent off
*newcastle* retain fourth place as @entity137 scores hat - trick against @entity134
