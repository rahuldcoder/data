@entity0 -- sen. @entity3 's newest campaign videos are hammering home the key issues that he 's hoping will energize female voters to come out in november : domestic violence and equal pay			1
the @entity10 @entity9 released a pair of videos on his @entity14 page wednesday attacking his @entity16 rival rep. @entity15 for voting against equal pay legislation and against reauthorizing the @entity18			1
the crucial @entity20 race is locked in a statistical dead heat , and @entity3 is playing up his advantage among women			1
" we 've got to do something to break this cycle of domestic violence and @entity15 is not doing anything to help , " @entity24 , the director of a 24 - hour emergency domestic violence shelter , says in one video called " @entity27 "			0
" @entity33 got against women ? " @entity35 , from @entity36 , @entity10 , says in another			0
" @entity35 " is a regular in @entity3 's ads , appearing in at least four videos this year and focusing specifically issues relevant to female voters			1
the videos also come one day after @entity3 , the only remaining @entity10 @entity9 in @entity42 , launched a " @entity50 " tour to rally the demographic group that favors him over his @entity16 rival 48 to 39 % , according to a @entity45 / @entity44 poll released last week			1
that same poll showed the pair locked in a statistical dead heat , with @entity3 holding a two - point advantage			1
a @entity1 poll released in early september showed @entity15 leading by the same margin			0
@entity3 's latest videos on domestic violence strikes a sharply critical tone as the ad 's subject , @entity24 , says @entity15 " voted against protecting women and children from domestic abuse			1
" @entity15 campaign spokesman @entity65 pushed back against the ad claiming @entity3 is " making ridiculous election - year accusations			2
" " while senator @entity3 is busy perpetrating a fictitious ' @entity70 , ' it is the @entity72 economic policies that have harmed so many @entity10 women by increasing the cost of everything from health insurance to gasoline to groceries , " @entity65 said in an email			0
and the campaign 's response echoed the theme of the @entity33 's latest minute - long ad posted on his campaign website the same day @entity3 launched his " @entity50 " tour			2
the minute - long ad features a woman , @entity87 , who says @entity3 's vote for @entity89 has hurt her small business			2
the ad also opens with @entity15 walking alongside another woman			0
but @entity3 's ad focuses on the context of @entity15 's vote regarding the re-authorization of @entity18 , and notes that one in four women are victims of domestic abuse -- a statistic backed by the @entity100			1
this wo n't be the first time @entity15 has had to defend his vote on the domestic violence legislation , which he has said was too broad			0
@entity15 's website reads , " violence against women is unacceptable , period			2
" the @entity3 - approved ad also states that @entity15 was the only congressman from @entity10 to " vote this way " on reauthorizing the @entity18			0
@entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 were also part of the 138 republicans who voted against the final act last year			0
those congressmen had voted in favor of a @entity16 alternative though , but @entity15 said no to both			0
the state 's other senator , @entity122 , also voted against the bill that passed the @entity20 , but voted for the @entity16 alternative			0
but the @entity3 ad is trying to paint a stark contrast with @entity24 closing the ad by saying : " there 's a big difference between @entity3 and @entity15 , one wants to protect women and children , the other does n't			1

@entity3 's campaign released a pair of videos wednesday , both *highlighting* women 's issues .
recent polling shows @entity15 and @entity3 are in a statistical dead heat .
both campaigns are reaching out to women voters this week .
