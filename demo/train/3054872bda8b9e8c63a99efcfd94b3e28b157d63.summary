@entity0 -- it was a long summer for president @entity3 , who for months has defended his decision not to send @entity6 troops to fight @entity7 on the ground in the @entity9			1
but lawmakers contend that in the wake of a rapidly - spreading @entity16 crisis and the upcoming midterm elections , the president 's commitment towards fighting the extremist terrorist organization has fallen short			1
comparing the spread of @entity16 to the @entity7 threat against the @entity6 , sen. @entity20 , @entity22 - @entity21 , said sunday that he does n't believe that the president is handling each issue with equal rigor			1
" the stronger @entity16 gets in @entity28 , the more it spreads and the more entrenched it is -- the more endangered we are , " @entity20 told @entity26 on @entity1 's " @entity27 " sunday			1
" the same ( goes ) for radical @entity30 in the @entity9			0
it seems to be that the president is all in when it comes to @entity16			2
i want to compliment him for sending troops to help get ahead of this in @entity28 , but we have a series of half - measures with ( @entity7 )			2
" his @entity42 colleague , sen. @entity41 of @entity43 , went a step further sunday , saying that the president 's foreign policy " is being trapped by his campaign rhetoric			1
" @entity16 becomes an election issue " i 'm very fearful as we look at the current military strategy that it is surrounding the november elections and that he wo n't have the resolve to follow through with what needs to be done in a sustained effort to destroy @entity7 , and we 're about to repeat the same thing with @entity60 , " @entity41 said on @entity50			1
asked if she thought the president would pull back some of his commitment towards the issue after the midterm elections , @entity41 responded , " i 'm very concerned about that ... and his resolve in this regard			1
" both @entity41 and @entity20 have said that they do not believe that @entity7 can be defeated without @entity6 ground forces in @entity71 , a move the president has vehemently opposed			1
but should @entity3 decide to increase the @entity6 military presence in the @entity9 to fight @entity7 , he 'll have to first face @entity75 and a @entity42 - controlled @entity76 , whose leader says the president needs to outline a more robust foreign policy strategy for @entity75 to take up the debate			1
" the president has to lay out a strategy			0
i do n't see that for the @entity6 public , " majority leader @entity82 , @entity83 , said on @entity85 ' " @entity84			1
" " what is the goal ? what is our foreign doctrine ? what is our foreign policy ? " " i see the threat before us			0
looking at the chambers , we will see what people debate , " he said			0
" i can pick and choose what goes forward but would never second - guess the @entity76			1
" @entity100 explains how @entity16 is like @entity7 even if a bill were to pass allowing the president to expand @entity6 's military presence in the @entity9 , the looming threat of defense cuts under sequestration could limit the administration 's response			2
that issue , lawmakers say , is a concern in which they are willing to reach across the aisle and compromise for			0
" i want to sit down with sens. ( @entity115 ) @entity114 , @entity116 , ( and ) @entity117 to replace these cuts , " @entity20 told @entity26			2
" republicans have to give on revenue , close deductions in the tax code and put the money back in the sequestration and entitlement reform			0
" @entity126 sen. @entity116 of @entity127 shared that sentiment			0
" sequestration has to be either eliminated or somehow postponed and that goes not just for some of the issues like the @entity133			0
that goes for every agency of the federal government , " @entity116 said on " @entity27			0
" " and people like @entity20 who want to work on the issue , i want to work with him on it			2
those types of issues are going to have to be dealt with no matter who is in charge			0
" despite the looming threat of sequestration , the public anxiety over of the @entity16 crisis and the recent @entity149 failures that have come to light this past month , the administration says the @entity6 people should n't be worried about its ability to handle the @entity7 threat and other matters of national security			1
" i do understand that people have had a growing skepticism of institutions for a long time , including government , " senior @entity3 advisor @entity157 said on @entity159 's " @entity158			2
" " but people should know that ... where a problem arises , we deal with it			0
we deal with it quickly , we deal with it forcefully to make sure it does n't happen			0

sen. @entity20 says @entity3 " is all in when it comes to @entity16 , " but not @entity7
sen. @entity41 says she is concerned @entity3 will reduce his commitment to fighting @entity7 after midterms
@entity76 majority leader @entity82 says he would n't " second - guess " the @entity76 on an @entity7 vote
@entity181 says that despite skepticism , it is *capable* of dealing with any matter of problem quickly
