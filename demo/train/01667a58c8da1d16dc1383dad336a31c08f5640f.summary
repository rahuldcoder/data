-- the youngest of @entity3 's main islands -- and it 's still growing , with over 500 acres of new land added over the last 30 years -- the @entity6 of @entity8 overflows with outdoor adventures			1
here you can hike to the edge of the world 's longest - running volcanic eruption , then climb @entity3 's two tallest peaks			1
dropping back down to earth , trek into forested valleys harboring ancient heiau ( @entity19 temples ) and wild beaches where you can camp by the surf in the silvery moonlight			2
@entity3 : the state that does n't vote @entity25 start by going straight to the heart of the @entity6 's live lava action : @entity25			1
here @entity28 has been spewing lava since 1983			1
during just the last few years , @entity30 has once again become a roiling lake of fire			0
traditionally believed to be the home of @entity33 , the @entity19 goddess of fire and volcanoes , @entity30 looks especially hellish after dark			0
@entity3 : dos and don'ts wait , is n't all this volcanic activity dangerous ? not exactly			1
@entity19 shield volcanoes rarely erupt with fountains of fire , but instead send out lava flows that ooze above ground or in underground tubes with glowing skylights			2
when those flows reach the ocean , they send up huge plumes of steam that billow like clouds during the day and glow ghoulishly at night			0
@entity0 : hiking @entity52 : a walk through @entity3 's history and culture depending on current volcanic activity , you may be able to hike to within view of the lava flow , either inside the park or at county - run @entity63 viewing area ; call +1 ( 808 ) 961 - 8093 for up - to - date information			1
to luau or not to luau ? your @entity3 tips if you want to set foot on older , more stable but still steaming lava flows , as seen in the alien landscapes of the 2001 @entity71 remake of " @entity72 , " follow the park 's 4 - mile @entity73 , which descends from the volcanic crater rim and traipses over jet - back lava flows , which are slowly being recolonized by native plants , and through birdsong - filled @entity78 ( oases ) spared @entity33 's wrath			1
@entity81 in a far - flung corner of @entity25 , @entity81 ( " @entity83 " in @entity19 ) , the most massive volcano in @entity3 , stands watch			1
if you 're a peak - bagger , the 19 - mile trek to its summit is a worthy challenge			2
intense sun exposure , white - out fog and the risks of hypothermia and altitude sickness do n't deter ambitious , physically fit climbers from this multi-day ascent over a moonscape of volcanic lava flows to @entity100 's otherworldly summit caldera			1
travel snapshots : natural beauty shines in @entity8 day hikers who want to take the shortcut use the @entity105 , another strenuous and breathtakingly high trail ( 13 miles round - trip ) that starts off @entity108 outside the park			2
it 's a steep , unearthly beautiful climb through rainbow - colored volcanic cinders to @entity81 's windy , exposed summit			1
get an early start ( before 8 a.m. ) and check the weather forecast before setting out			0
the observatory access road is rough and mostly unpaved ; a 4wd vehicle is helpful			0
note most rental - car companies prohibit driving on unpaved roads , even in @entity119			2
@entity0 : @entity121 's coast and mountains : a hiker 's dream @entity125 @entity125 is the world 's tallest mountain -- taller even than @entity128			1
@entity129 -- when measured from its base deep on the ocean floor all the way to its summit at 13,796 feet above sea level			0
startlingly clear skies have made the summit an ideal place for building high - tech astronomical observatories ; some are open to the public for visits and tours			2
for ancient @entity143 , @entity125 was a pilgrimage spot for sacred ceremonies including burials , as well as collecting materials to make tools			0
the snow goddess @entity150 lives here , among the prehistoric lava flows and tiny @entity152			0
start partway up the mountain at the @entity154 , which offers free star - gazing programs nightly			0
acclimatize to the heady 9000 - foot elevation while you sip hot chocolate indoors			0
most rental cars are not allowed to drive up to the summit , but you can still get there the hard way -- on foot			0
it 's an eerie 6 - mile climb each way , snaking around cinder cones at eye - level with the clouds and within distant view of the ocean , over two dizzying miles down below			1
not up for such a workout ? catch sunset at the summit on a guided @entity175 instead			0
@entity176 & @entity177 as thrilling as the @entity6 's volcanoes are , just as impressive are its emerald amphitheater valleys			1
curving along the coast in the shadow of the @entity184 , most of these enormous valleys are completely inaccessible			2
but you can still capture panoramas of wildly bucking surf , patchwork fields of green taro plants and lacy waterfalls dropping off the cliffsides from the @entity192			0
it 's at the end of a paved highway from @entity196 on the northern @entity197			0
from the lookout , it 's a knee - knockingly steep 1 - mile walk down a @entity175 road to black - sand @entity201 where spinner dolphins cavort offshore			1
hire a guide if you want to venture further back into @entity192 , because locals are fiercely protective of private property and you 'll need someone who knows the landscape			0
alternatively , get a permit in advance for a @entity213 backpacking trip to utterly remote @entity214 , abandoned after a tsunami wiped out its village in 1946			0
the 9 - mile @entity217 from @entity192 into @entity214 is rough , hazardous and extremely steep in spots , so only experienced backcountry hikers should attempt it			0
@entity0 : @entity3 's @entity6 : how to make the most of a short trip @entity223 a much easier day hike awaits in the @entity226 district , at the end of a paved highway winding past @entity229			1
@entity230 to ancient @entity143 , the fertile @entity223 thrived with taro fields into the 20th century until the @entity232 diverted water			0
today you can hike down into this amphitheatre valley on a rocky hiking trail that 's less than a mile long			2
finish at a black - sand beach where you can sit , contemplate the breaking waves and feel the mana ( spiritual power ) of the @entity6 's valleys and volcanoes			1
