published the results of a survey asking over 4,000 @entity13 footballers about their experiences of racist abuse			1
just 200 chose to respond			2
of those to reply in the anonymous consultation , 24 % said they have been subjected to racist abuse in football stadiums , while 57 % claim they have witnessed racist abuse			1
" it 's enough of a sample -- it 's never been done before , " @entity9 trustee @entity21 told @entity0			1
" we simply do n't have the resources to conduct a wide enough survey and to get the numbers that might make the likes of @entity0 jump up and down , " said @entity21 , who was the first black chairman of the @entity24 -- the players ' union			1
he 's also a former player			0
while @entity9 struggles with resources , @entity21 also laid bare the tensions that exist within the professional game , criticizing the @entity35 , the @entity36 and the clubs themselves for not doing enough to address the problem of racism			1
in october @entity1 manager @entity40 had to defend himself against a racism slur after using the " feed the monkey " punchline from an old @entity45 joke when telling defender @entity46 to pass the ball to winger @entity48 during a @entity50 qualifier			0
@entity46 and @entity48 are both black			0
" i would like to apologize if any offense has been caused by what i said at halftime , " the 66 - year - old @entity40 told @entity8 media at the time			2
" there was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate			0
however @entity21 says that 's just not good enough and called on the @entity36 , the body which represents @entity13 coaches , to show more leadership			1
" so @entity40 is n't making stupid , inappropriate comments at halftime in the dressing room during a @entity50 qualifying match			0
" @entity0 contacted the @entity36 for comment and is awaiting a response			0
" these football clubs are employers , " added @entity21			1
" they have a duty to their staff , and their staff to their employers			0
" why is this happening ? why should football get some kind of special concession because they 're footballers and football clubs ? " he wondered			1
almost all of the footballers surveyed by @entity9 -- 91 % -- agreed that " social media has led to an increase in them receiving discriminatory abuse , " the organization said in a statement			1
former @entity1 and @entity92 striker @entity91 has -- more than once -- said he has been racially abused on @entity93 , and two years ago a 21 - year - old student was sent to jail for racist comments he made on @entity93 after @entity98 midfielder @entity97 collapsed on the pitch against @entity100 in a game and almost died			1
the 21 - year - old had pleaded guilty to the @entity103			0
the @entity105 survey of players also found that 92 % of players thought fan - on - player discrimination was common or extremely common , and 69 % of players felt that , due to their profession , they are more exposed to abuse			1
all of this was enhanced by the rise of social media			1
" what the social media platforms need to do is acknowledge the level of the problem and introduce some specific procedures , " said @entity9 spokesman @entity114			1
" there has to be a more proactive stance			0
" @entity93 was not immediately available for comment and @entity123 declined to provide an official response			0
but @entity21 is more concerned that the clubs are n't taking enough of a proactive approach			1
" i 'd like to see them conducting mentoring sessions with football players right across the board in order that players understand the impact making silly statements on @entity93 can have on themselves and their clubs , " he said			1
" it is an employer 's duty to ensure that its staff behave in an appropriate manner			0
a lot of players on social networking sites are making some remarkable pronouncements and it 's bringing the game into disrepute , and also bringing the club and its brand into question			1
" the @entity35 admitted more could be done to educate players			2
" relaying key messages around equality and inclusion into the often ' closed off ' domain of the dressing room is something the game as a whole needs to keep working on , " said the @entity35 in a statement			2
" we hope our new @entity162 films , which show players exactly what to do when they hear or see discrimination , is one such tool			2
" the @entity167 said in a statement : " all @entity167 clubs have social media policies for their players and the @entity167 itself produced social media guidelines , at the request of our member clubs , in 2012			1
" additionally , the @entity167 education department runs social media training sessions for @entity179 players , and has done so for the last three seasons			1
" @entity9 was established in 1993 to try to confront racist attitudes within the game			1
the group says it works with the leagues , clubs , fans and players in combating racism			2
the @entity9 survey was carried out between august 2013 and december 2013 and followed footballer @entity191 ' refusal in 2012 to wear a t - shirt in support of the anti-racism campaign group due to what he saw was the football authorities ' failure to come down hard on those who are found guilty of racism			1
" this is not an attack on @entity6 , " @entity191 told the @entity200 in october 2012			0
" i am passionate about what the @entity24 represents and @entity6 but they ( the league ) have to do better , we have to do better			0
" @entity21 has mixed views on @entity191 ' stance			1
" he was right , football was n't doing enough			2
i 've less sympathy with the way he went about it			0
we want the same things			0
that is , we want football to not appear apologetic to racist behavior , " the former @entity100 striker said			1
" we have bans now , we have automatic bans -- a minimum five matches for the football league , 10 matches for @entity221 , and that 's fine			2
but the process can take forever			0
" @entity21 is referring to the time it took the @entity35 to handle high - profile cases involving a handful of players including @entity229			1
however , @entity1 's governing body insisted it was important not to rush these cases in order to reach a fair verdict			0
" many of the cases the @entity35 presides over require detailed expert consideration of a range of issues , where assistance from outside the organization is often enlisted ... , " it said in a statement			0
" to that end , and to get a fair and satisfactory outcome , the process is n't always a swift one			0
" nearly two months had passed before @entity229 was punished for the controversial " quenelle " gesture he made in late december , arguably creating a vacuum for plenty of heated debate			2
last month @entity229 was banned for five matches and fined Â £ 80,000 ( $ 130,000 ) by the @entity35 for performing the gesture after scoring for @entity252 in a @entity167 match against @entity254			0
the " quenelle , " which the former @entity259 international said was dedicated to his comedian friend @entity255 -- who uses it as part of his act -- is believed by some to be a @entity262 salute in reverse and has been linked with anti-semitism in @entity229 's homeland			0
@entity21 , the former union chairman , despairs at the way @entity229 's case was handled			1
" it 's taken the best part of two months to make a decision that should 've been done in two weeks , " @entity21 said			2
" if @entity229 had apologized , which he should have done , and @entity252 had imposed a two - week fine immediately , it would 've been done and dusted			0
" here the first thing that the employer does is to protect the player because he 's a famous footballer			2
" there is a lot that is fundamentally wrong with the way football deals with racism and @entity252 is a very clear example of that			2
" @entity252 declined to respond directly to @entity21 ' criticism , but pointed to the statement it released on march 14 after @entity229 quit the club			2
" the club considers the conduct of @entity229 on december 28 , coupled with his purported termination on @entity289 this evening , to be gross misconduct			0
as a result the club has tonight written to @entity229 giving him 14 days ' notice of termination as required under his contract , " it said at the time			0
when the row broke out , @entity229 defended his actions on social media , arguing his gesture was " anti-system " rather than anti-semitic			1
" this is a dedication to @entity255			0
with regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations of my quenelle , they are the ones that create confusion and controversy without knowing what it really means , this gesture , " the @entity259 wrote on @entity93			0
" and of course , i am neither racist nor anti-semitic and i fully assume ( stand by ) my gesture			0
" so while the talk and the rants on social media sites grows ever more vitriolic , and controversial , it sounds as if @entity1 's football authorities have plenty of work to do - not least in coming up with a co-ordinated strategy in dealing with the issue of race and discrimination .			1
