video , whether it 's a natural sound package , an interview , " b - roll , " or a simple sound bite , is the hallmark of multimedia production			1
two veterans of @entity3 photojournalism , @entity8 and @entity9 , share their tips below			1
after reading these , @entity13 would like you to participate in this week 's boot camp project , by profiling a person who works with his or her hands			1
shoot in series give a variety of shots to the viewer : a wide shot to establish the scene , medium shot to bring the viewer closer , and a close - up to reveal the action			1
you can mix this up too , starting a sequence with the close - up instead			2
hold your shots always hold your shots for at least five seconds at the beginning and five seconds at the end			1
this technique will give our viewers a " less jarring experience " and make it easier to edit later			1
use a tripod or mono - pod nothing distracts viewers more than shaky or lopsided video			2
you can purchase an inexpensive tripod to correct these problems			2
the more expensive a tripod is , the more control you have over your camera shots			1
a tripod with a fluid head will allow you to accomplish the smoothest zooms , tilts , and pans			2
limit your zooms and pans all of us have been guilty of overusing zooms and pans , but you must resist this temptation			2
these moves should only be used on tripods			2
if you have time , practice the zoom or pan before you start rolling			1
try to focus more on getting wide , medium , and ( my favorite ) close - up shots			1
try to physically move closer to your subject instead of zooming if possible			2
if you do zoom , try to stick to your optical zoom , not your digital zoom			2
digital zoom looks bad and should only be used if your subject is out of your normal camera range			2
have a foreground subject it is always interesting to have an object or subject in the foreground			2
for example , when shooting the exterior of a house , use the mailbox in the foreground for a more dramatic look , or pan from the mailbox to the house			2
use manual controls , if possible if you have a " prosumer camera , " use the manual controls instead of the automatic if you have the time			0
automatic focus and auto iris can distract from the quality of your video if the subject or light is constantly changing location and intensity			0
to do a proper manual focus , zoom all the way in to your subject ( before recording ) get your focus , and zoom out			0
if you are interviewing someone , zoom in to their eyes and set your focus			0
if you do n't do this , your subject with be " soft " which is out of focus			0
get a variety of angles and shots only showing wide or medium shots will get boring quickly			1
try to vary your shots			1
always get a wide or establishing shot , then try to get in close to the action and get close - ups without interfering with the story			0
do n't talk while shooting " b - roll " do not --- i repeat --- do not talk while you are shooting awesome footage ( or " b - roll , " a.k.a. supplemental or alternate footage )			0
we need to hear the natural sound of the event and not your commentary			0
if you talk during the event , the viewers will lose that sound , and we would generally lower or edit out your commentary if it distracts from the video			0
use a microphone when interviewing someone even though camera mics will do in a breaking news situation , wireless lavaliere or stick mics are the tools of choice for good storytelling ( if you have a @entity144 cam , it is wise to invest in a wireless system , for use with interviews or following a subject around without having to hold a mic )			0
if possible , use a windscreen to keep out wind noise and audio pops from your subject			0
have the interview subject restate the question for example : if you ask how does this machine work ? " have the subject answer , " well , the machine works in this way ...			1
" @entity13 : put your video skills to work get to know the subject before rolling tape furthermore , when conducting any interview , always start with the person 's full name , spelling and if appropriate , where are they from and what they do for a living			1
the name is very important to @entity13 producers and for air			1
also , never ask a question that can be answered with a simple " yes " or " no. " ask a question like , " can you describe to me what you saw ? " have them describe the details and their personal feelings			0
use a camera light for indoor interviews if you are shooting indoors and the light is low , use a camera ( bat light )			0
you should ideally have one with a dimmer but these can get pretty pricey			0
when you are shooting outdoors , always have the sun to your back and your subject facing the sun if possible			0
making sure people 's faces are lit will help them stand out from their background			0
bring extra batteries and media for every shoot as they say in the @entity207 , " be prepared			0
" make sure your batteries are fully charged and you have plenty of extra videotapes or media before you head out there and get your extraordinary video			0
purchase a decent camera case to protect your camera that also has room for your extra batteries and media			0
be creative you do n't have to reinvent video production , but be observant and try to find shots that you do n't normally see on the air			1
