@entity0 -- grimacing with emotion , entertainment legend @entity2 implored a @entity5 committee on wednesday to stop what experts call chronic emotional , physical , sexual and financial abuse of elderly @entity10 by family members and other caregivers			1
the 90 - year - old @entity13 told the @entity14 that he was abused by a family member who took control of his life , and described feeling " scared , disappointed , yes , and angry			1
" " you ca n't believe that it 's happening to you , " @entity13 said			1
" @entity13 has filed a restraining order against his stepson and stepdaughter , claiming both emotional and financial abuse			1
the committee 's hearing brought attention to what experts call chronic elder abuse in @entity10			1
@entity13 said @entity31 should pass a law to make it a specific crime			1
" i 'm asking you to stop this elderly abuse			2
i mean to stop it			2
not tomorrow , not next month , but now , " he shouted from the witness table			2
pass legislation and send it to be signed into law by president @entity41 , he urged , so that the nation can say " it 's a crime and we will not allow it in the @entity10			0
" following the hearing , committee chairman sen. @entity45 , @entity47 , introduced legislation that would create an @entity50 within the @entity51 to help coordinate law enforcement response to elder abuse			1
according to a report by the @entity56 , more than 14 % of noninstitutionalized older adults experienced some form of elder abuse in 2009			1
the report cautions that number may be lower than the reality because many instances of elder abuse are underreported			1
" for years i suffered silently			1
i did n't want to tell anybody			0
i could n't muster the courage and you have to have courage , " @entity13 said wednesday			2
" i needed help and i knew i needed it			0
even when i tried to speak up , i was told to shut up and be quiet			0
" the @entity56 report found that many @entity71 programs at the state level have growing case loads and dwindling resources			0
the elder population of the @entity10 is expected to grow by 60 % over the next 25 years			2
other witnesses detailed the depth of the problem			2
" i tell the physicians i train that if they 've seen 15 or 20 older people in their practices ... then they have probably met an elder abuse victim , whether they realize it or not , " said dr. @entity79 , director of geriatrics at the @entity81			1
based on a new study of elder abuse in @entity90 , " it would appear that for every elder abuse victim that makes it into an official service or reporting system , another 23 to 24 go undetected , " @entity79 said			1
@entity96 , director of the group @entity97 , told of a man charged by prosecutors in @entity100 with murdering his mother			0
" his crime ? letting her rot to death with eight huge pressure sores , several to the bone , while he played internet poker and lived off her pension , " @entity96 said			0
" his excuse ? she did n't want to go to a nursing home or a doctor ; he was just respecting her wishes			0
" according to @entity96 , the woman was " imprisoned in her bed by immobility , dementia and isolation			0
" " she moaned and cried out for help continuously in the weeks before her death , " @entity96 said			0
" neighbors closed their windows and her son put in earplugs to muffle her cries			0
no one called @entity128 or 911			0
it 's hard to believe the response would have been the same had the cries come from a child , a younger woman or a dog			0
" the witnesses noted that victims of elder abuse put a greater strain on support services by requiring more medical care , housing assistance and other help			1
@entity13 summed up the challenge when he spoke of the personal difficulty that victims of elder abuse face			1
" you 're afraid , but you 're also thinking about your other family members , " he said , noting concern about potential criticism from " your family , your friends , people who know them			0
" " they might not want to accept the dysfunction , " @entity13 said , adding that " one should love their families as i do			2
" the diminutive @entity13 has been a film star for decades , starting with his role in @entity163 films in the 1930s			2
