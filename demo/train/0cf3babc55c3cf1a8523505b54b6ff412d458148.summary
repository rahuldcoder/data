@entity1 , @entity0 -- in @entity5 in august , @entity4 runner @entity3 will once again find himself staring down the 10,000 meters of rubberized track that curls between him and a third gold medal in the @entity10 event			1
@entity3 goes on a training run with companions at home in @entity14			2
he won gold in 1996 and 2000 , but finished a disappointing fifth in 2004 when a problem with his @entity19 tendon hampered training in the lead up to @entity22			2
this time it 's different			2
he 's pounding a well - worn path on often twice - daily runs through the streets of his hometown of @entity14			0
he 's older and injury - free			0
in 2004 , he was under pressure to become the first man in history to win gold over 10,000 meters in three consecutive @entity10			1
now it 's not even his first choice of race to run			0
" i 'm not interested in the 10,000 meters , " he says ; a somewhat surprising statement from a man just weeks away from competing in the world 's greatest ever sporting event , the pinnacle of any athlete 's career			1
the problem is he 's been there , done that and recognizes that he 's unlikely to match his younger opponents in speed over the distance			0
in @entity5 , he 'll be toeing the starting line with the current world champion @entity49 and @entity50 , both @entity4 who finished first and second in @entity22 in 2004			0
" they 're in good shape			0
they 're already superior athletes , " @entity3 says			1
" for me to be there , it 's not for @entity49 or @entity50 , just to be in the group , to stay together , to share their experience			0
most of them they know how to compete , they know how to win			2
" in march , @entity3 made the highly - publicized decision not to contest the @entity10 marathon in @entity5			1
he insists it 's not a slight against @entity66 and the @entity10 organizers but , as an asthmatic , he says the risks to his health are too great			0
running the 10,000 meters was a compromise , says @entity72 of @entity73 , @entity3 's manager			1
@entity3 did n't want to disappoint his fans and fellow countrymen who had been expecting him to race			1
" of course he 's running for himself also , " @entity72 says , " but for him , it 's a team effort to run for his country			0
he 'll be very happy if the other two guys are doing well			0
i think @entity3 would be very happy with a bronze medal			1
" would he ? " yeah , absolutely , " @entity3 insists			2
" the 10,000 meters is not my event any more			1
if i won bronze , fine			1
even if i do n't compete , i do n't mind			1
" while the @entity87 might merit a small note on @entity3 's calendar , there is a big red circle marked around september 28th , the date of the @entity92 , just five weeks later			1
" one of my targets this year is the @entity92 , to run a good time and if possible surpass the world record , " he says			1
it 's a record he set in spectacular style last november , covering the 42 kilometers in just two hours , four minutes and 26 seconds			1
it was his 25th world record			2
he attempted to better the time at the @entity101 in january , but missed out by a mere 27 seconds , a failure @entity3 blames on over-enthusiasm at the start ; he just ran too fast			2
" i paid the price at the end because i could not push anymore , especially the last seven or eight kilometers , " he says			0
in @entity107 , he 's hoping to strike the right balance of restraint and speed to take him over the line first and fastest			1
it wo n't be an easy feat. training for the 10,000 meters is all about speed			1
after the @entity10 he 'll literally have to switch gears to work on his strength and stamina			0
" it 's not a normal preparation for a marathon , " @entity3 's manager , @entity72 says			1
" normally you have a few months of preparation			0
it 's kind of new territory he will be in			0
" " i think it will be ok because @entity3 's 35 and his body is a running machine , " @entity72 says			1
" he 's done so much endurance , but you do n't know how the body will react			2
for him and for us it 's something to see because it 's never been done before at this level			0
" @entity3 is not fazed			2
he 's simply merged training for the two disciplines into one unconventional schedule			0
" i 'm trying to work on endurance and a bit of speed			0
if i move completely to speed work i lose the benefits of the endurance training			0
i 'm trying to handle both , " he says			0
it seems a lot of work for someone who 's conceded that his days as the fastest man over 10,000 meters are over			1
he 's already passed the baton to @entity49 , who bettered his world record over the distance in 2004 , and again in 2005 , at a blistering 26:17.53			2
@entity3 may not be putting money on himself to win in @entity5 , but he 's in no doubt that one of his @entity4 team mates will be first across the line			1
" for sure , " he says , " no question about it			0

marathon runner @entity3 is one of @entity162 's most *celebrated* athletes
he 's aiming to break the world marathon record he set in @entity107 in 2007 this year
he 's contesting the 10,000 meters in @entity87 but does n't expect to win
@entity3 : " if i won bronze , fine . even if i do n't compete , i do n't mind "
