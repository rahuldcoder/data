@entity0 -- @entity0 prosecutors say they may seek the death penalty against abortion doctor @entity4 , who is charged with murder after allegedly performing illegal late - term abortions at a dirty facility			1
authorities allege that some of the infants were born viable and alive during the sixth , seventh and eighth months of pregnancy and then were killed with scissors , which were used to cut their spinal cords			1
prosecutors " did preserve the right to seek the death penalty at a later date by giving a notice of aggravating circumstances in court today , " said @entity14 , spokeswoman for the district attorney 's office , in a statement released wednesday			1
the circumstances in this case are the deaths of people under age 12 and multiple murder charges @entity4 , 70 , faces eight counts of murder in the deaths of seven babies and a 41 - year - old woman			1
@entity34 died november 19 , 2009 , after overdosing on anesthetics prescribed by the doctor , according to @entity0 district attorney @entity37			2
@entity4 's defense attorney , @entity38 , appeared in court wednesday for the formal arraignments			1
@entity4 's presence was not required , and he was not in court			1
@entity38 promised to " vigorously defend " @entity4 against the charges			1
last month , @entity45 gov. @entity44 fired a half - dozen employees and announced changes in two departments , calling state oversight of an abortion clinic where the deaths occurred " despicable			2
" the @entity52 and the @entity53 have primary oversight over such clinics			0
" this does n't even rise to the level of government run amok			0
it was government not running at all			0
to call this unacceptable does n't say enough			0
it 's despicable , '' @entity44 said			0
seven employees from the @entity52 , as well as the @entity64 , a branch of the @entity53 -- are no longer employed by the state , having either resigned or been terminated since the situation came to light , @entity44 said in statement			0
in addition , four other former employees named in the grand jury investigation had previously resigned			0
district attorney @entity37 earlier called the facility " a house of horrors " that performed " botched and illegal abortions " and was full of containers of fetuses ' body parts			0
six other defendants face charges			2
all had some role at the @entity84 clinic , which was run by @entity4 and served mostly low - income minority women , @entity37 said			1
a grand jury investigation determined that health and licensing officials had received repeated reports about @entity4 's practices for two decades , but had taken no action , even after learning that women died during routine abortions , @entity37 has said .			2
