-- the @entity2 was successfully berthed at the @entity3 on wednesday as the station 's crew caught and secured the unmanned cargo capsule high above @entity7 , @entity1 announced			1
@entity11 astronaut @entity10 latched onto @entity2 with a robotic arm at 6:56 a.m. et. by 9:03 , the craft was attached to the station 's docking module , the space agency said			1
" looks like we 've tamed the @entity2 , " @entity1 's @entity15 , commander of the current @entity3 mission , said in a statement released by @entity2			1
@entity19 mission lifted off sunday carrying about a half ton of supplies for the station 's crew			0
it caught up with the @entity3 wednesday morning , 273 miles over the @entity24 , @entity1 said			1
" this is a big moment in the course of this mission and for commercial spaceflight , " @entity2 founder @entity25 said in a statement released by the company			1
" we are pleased that @entity2 is now ready to deliver its cargo to the @entity3			1
" it 's one of a dozen missions ordered by @entity1 under a contract with the company			0
a dragon capsule successfully delivered 1,000 pounds of cargo to the station in may			1
@entity1 says the @entity3 crew will start unloading the craft on thursday			1
@entity2 will be attached to the station for two and a half weeks			1
after the supplies are pulled off , astronauts will reload the craft with scientific experiments and failed equipment that can be repaired and sent back			1
it 's scheduled to return to @entity7 on october 28			0
@entity19 remained on course despite engine trouble on its booster after liftoff sunday night			0
a minute and 19 seconds after the @entity56 rocket lifted off from @entity57 , @entity58 , one of its nine @entity61 engines " lost pressure suddenly , " the company disclosed monday			2
the rocket " did exactly what it was designed to do , " as its flight computer made adjustments to keep the @entity2 headed into the proper orbit , the company said			2
however , a communications satellite the @entity56 9 carried as a secondary payload did not end up in its designated orbit			0
in a statement issued wednesday afternoon , @entity2 said it had to use more fuel and liquid oxygen to put the @entity2 into orbit because of the failed engine			2
" for the protection of the space station mission , @entity1 had required that a restart of the upper stage only occur if there was a very high probability ( over 99 % ) of fully completing the second burn , " @entity76 said			0
" while there was sufficient fuel on board to do so , the liquid oxygen on board was only enough to achieve a roughly 95 % likelihood of completing the second burn , so @entity56 did not attempt a restart			0
" the satellite , built by @entity93 - based satellite firm @entity92 , was supposed to have been carried into a higher orbit by the @entity56 's second stage			0
@entity92 said monday that its satellite was circling in a lower - than - intended orbit , and it was trying to determine whether the satellite 's own propulsion systems could carry it the rest of the way up			2
@entity2 said it was studying flight data with @entity1 to figure out what happened , " and we will apply those lessons to future flights			2
" initial readings indicated that an engine fairing broke apart under stress , it said monday			0
despite that problem , @entity1 administrator @entity112 called sunday 's launch and the mission " a critical event in space flight			2
" and @entity2 , which @entity25 founded in 2002 , is looking beyond cargo flights to develop a version of the dragon that would carry astronauts to the iss. it 's one of three companies , along with @entity124 and aerospace giant @entity125 , that @entity1 has chosen to work on the project			1
within the next few months , @entity127 is expected to fly its own demonstration flight to the space station			0
instead of using @entity57 as its launch site , the company 's rocket will take off from @entity133 , off the coast of @entity135			2
@entity127 has a nearly $ 2 billion contract with @entity1 for station resupply missions			0
in 2008 , @entity1 chose @entity2 's @entity56 launch vehicle and the @entity2 spacecraft to resupply the space station after the space shuttle program was retired			1
the space agency plans to turn much of its focus toward exploring deep into the solar system			0
" the $ 1.6 billion contract represents a minimum of 12 flights , with an option to order additional missions for a cumulative total contract value of up to $ 3.1 billion , " @entity2 says on its website .			0

the @entity2 was successfully " tamed , " the @entity3 commander says
the capsule will spend about *18* days at the iss and bring back scientific experiments
one of the capsule 's 9 engines died during launch monday
