@entity0 , @entity1 -- when people say the message of @entity7 ' " @entity6 " is as relevant today as it was in 1843 , they usually have in mind @entity9 's conversion			1
overnight , he 's transformed from a mean old skinflint who believes that those unable to support themselves had better die " and decrease the surplus population " to an almost riotously generous giver to charitable causes			0
they remember especially , perhaps , @entity9 's change of heart toward his poor , underpaid clerk @entity20 and how he promises to ensure that @entity20 will be able to afford the medical treatment that his beloved little son , the crippled @entity22 , will need if he is to survive -- a plot detail that resonates with particular strength in @entity25 today , where citizens struggle with health care costs			1
less often remembered , though , is an eerie interlude that can easily be taken as a mirror of our own times : @entity9 's appalled encounter with the two fearful children , a boy and a girl , " yellow , meagre , ragged , scowling , wolfish , " who emerge from the robes of the @entity39			0
the boy 's name is @entity42 and the girl 's is want , and the ghost warns @entity9 to beware of them both -- but especially of the boy on whose brow is written " that which is @entity48 , unless the writing be erased			2
" these fearful apparitions were products of @entity53 's " @entity52 , " when there was widespread economic distress and great fear of social breakdown , but it is part of @entity7 ' genius that he was recognizing here a theme that plays out everywhere , in every time and in every culture			1
it certainly does in today 's @entity25 with unemployment running at 10 percent ( or even higher in some areas ) and fears that this could lead to increased crime , and arguably has led to a growing sense of intolerance -- for example , towards immigrant communities -- and political extremism			1
it may seem odd to include such grim reminders in a tale about @entity77			0
but @entity7 knew about poverty : his own comfortable childhood was transformed when his father 's overspending landed him and most of his family in a debtors ' prison			1
as a boy , @entity7 worked long hours for about a year in a small - scale factory and later drew on this experience , to him deeply degrading , in the early chapters of " @entity88			2
" when not working he wandered about the streets of @entity0 , which he was later so richly to describe in " @entity90 " and his other great novels			0
for @entity7 , building a system of national education ( something frustrated in his day by bitter disputes between the different religious denominations ) and reforming sanitary ( or public health ) laws were the two things needing urgent attention from the nation 's lawmakers			1
he continued to fear the danger represented by the boy @entity106 , who re-appears in the last of his @entity77 books , " @entity110 " ( 1848 ) , as the savage street - child whom @entity109 , the protagonist , tries vainly to help			0
of course , things gradually improved for @entity53 , as they eventually do in most big countries struggling to survive economic lows			0
in the 1850s and 1860s , as the country became more prosperous , the fear of chaos and revolution receded			0
@entity7 dropped @entity42 and want from his hugely popular public reading version of the " @entity120 " ( performed from 1858 onward ) , though he never stopped calling attention to the national scandal of the scavenging hordes of starving , uncared - for street children in @entity0 and @entity53 's other great cities ( the first @entity127 , which brought in compulsory state education at the elementary level for all working - class children , was passed in the year of his death )			1
today , however , cities still confront gang activity and , as we witness a surge of political and religious extremism , we might wonder what @entity7 would make of the situation			2
as someone who sought in his own journals to fight against the depraving effect of cheap sensational literature produced by those he called " @entity146 to the basest passions of the lowest natures , " he would certainly have been alarmed and horrified by the level of pop culture violence and quasi-pornography -- on tv , in magazines and video games			2
he would have seen this primarily as a failure of public education , i believe			0
again , as someone who in his last novel , " @entity160 , " depicted a drug addict who turns to murder , he would have been equally appalled by the drug culture now so widespread among the young			0
the powerful presentation of @entity42 and want in the latest cinematic version of his immortal " @entity6 " would surely have struck him appropriate for our day			1
in the new @entity168 film a ferociously scowling @entity42 wields a lethal - looking knife , and want is a teenage prostitute driven crazy , presumably by drug abuse			2
@entity168 brilliantly demonstrates that the urgent social warning @entity7 sought to convey in the " @entity174 " in 1843 is quite as relevant to us today as is the story 's more personal message about the need for us to open our " shut - up hearts " to our fellow men and give generously to those less well off than ourselves			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184			0

@entity184 : " @entity6 " used @entity42 and want to warn of poverty 's effect
he says @entity7 thought education , health reform could stem social *decline*
@entity184 sees grim *parallels* to " @entity120 " in today 's culture , economy
@entity184 : heed book 's social warning as much as its *goodwill* message
