@entity1 there are some foods that people would eat only if they were stranded on a deserted island			1
no , that 's not a typo			2
although it would be equally disgusting , we 're talking about flower , not flour			0
introduced in the late 1960 's , flower - flavored @entity12 was designed to appeal to the hippie generation -- complete with a groovy , psychedelic dispenser			1
but even in the decade of free love , no love could be found for the flavor power of flower			0
floral scents make for great perfume , but nobody eats perfume , and apparently , there 's a reason why			0
the flower version flopped , and became the next addition to @entity1 's long and disturbing list of flavor failures			0
since its introduction in 1927 , the company has also sold ( however briefly ) coffee , licorice , eucalyptus , menthol , and cinnamon flavors			1
' i hate peas ! ' for as long as children have been shoving @entity40 sprouts under mashed potatoes and slipping green beans to the dog , parents have been hunting desperately for a way to end the vegetable discrimination			0
finally , in the 1970 's , @entity46 came to the rescue ( or at least tried ) with the release of " i hate peas ! " since kids love @entity53 fries so much , the company decided that disguising peas in a fry - shaped form was a sure - fire way to trick tots into getting their vitamins			1
children all over @entity61 saw through the ruse			1
after all , a pea is a pea is a pea , and the name of the product was more than apropos , no matter what it looked like			0
there were other thinly disguised vegetables in the company 's " i hate " line , but kids hated those , too			0
@entity78 - @entity77 any company smart enough to bless mankind with sprayable whipped cream -- the sort that promotes direct - to - mouth feeding -- has got to know a thing or two about immediate gratification			2
but sadly , the makers of @entity87 were unable to meld their keen understanding of human laziness with one of processed meat			0
they figured , if you 're cooking breakfast in the morning and you 've got a hankering for bacon , why dirty up a pan you 'll only have to clean later ? the solution : foil - wrapped @entity77 you could pop into your toaster for piping - hot pork in minutes			2
it seemed perfect for the busy 1970 's household , and what 's more , the stuff actually tasted pretty good			0
too bad the absorbent pad intended to soak up the dripping grease tended to leak , creating not only a fire hazard , but also a messy ( if not totally ruined ) toaster			0
ultimately , the product lasted about as long as it took to cook ; the company scrapped it before it went to market nationwide			0
coffee - flavored @entity114 in 1918 , the makers of @entity114 introduced a new flavor : coffee			1
its release was ostensibly based on the logic that , since lots of people like to drink coffee with dessert , they 'd be game for combining the two after - dinner treats			1
the company soon realized if anyone wants dessert coffee , they 're going to have a cup of it			2
in fact , if anyone wants coffee at all , they 're going to have a cup of it			2
not surprisingly , this realization came about the time they yanked the product off the shelves			0
all in all , it has n't harmed the company too much			2
at least they learned their lesson , right ? wrong			0
cola - flavored @entity114 was sold for about a year starting in 1942 , and for a brief while , the clear , wiggly dessert was sold in celery and chocolate flavors , too			1
@entity152 's @entity151 in the mid- 1970 's , @entity152 introduced @entity151 , an upscale , easy - to - make dinner that included a small bottle of vino			2
consumers knew @entity152 for their liquor and wines , so how were they supposed to know the wine included in @entity151 was an ingredient for the pasta sauce ? @entity164 consumers who did n't read the directions closely ended up pouring the contents of the bottle into a nice glass and getting a less - than - pleasant mouthful of salted wine			1
funky @entity171 while @entity61 are n't always fond of the @entity53 , they do love their @entity53 fries			1
in 2002 , hoping to follow the success of @entity176 's new " kiddie " ketchup versions ( in green and purple ) , @entity177 introduced @entity171 : chocolate - flavored , cinnamon - flavored , and blue - colored @entity53 fries			1
an awful lot of money was sunk into the product , but after a year of marketing , consumers still found the idea funky -- in the bad way			0
@entity190 were pulled off the shelves in 2003 , and images of blue fries with green ketchup were once again relegated to the world of @entity197 pop art. 7			2
@entity198 creating a super-caffeinated soda worked well for the makers of @entity201 , but not for the folks at @entity198			0
with 25 percent more caffeine than a cup of @entity206 , @entity203 introduced the cola - flavored product in 1989 , only to discover that most people just could n't bring themselves to drink soda with their cornflakes			1
for those who wanted a @entity198 in the morning , regular @entity198 did just fine , thankyouverymuch			0
@entity198 , like the coffee - flavored @entity211 before it , was scrapped after just a few months			1
@entity213 at some point in time , almost every adult has tasted baby food and discovered that the stuff is n't half bad			1
but that does n't mean people want to make a meal out of it			1
for some reason , @entity213 had to learn that lesson the hard way			0
in 1974 , the company released @entity213 , small servings of food meant for single adults , packaged in jars that were almost identical to those used for baby food			1
it did n't take long for @entity213 execs to figure out that most consumers , unless they were less than a year old , could n't get used to eating a pureed meal out of a jar -- particularly one depressingly labeled " @entity237			2
" baby food for grown - ups was pulled from the marketplace shortly after its birth			1
