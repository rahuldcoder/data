@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 sat in the courtroom monday and stared at the man accused of a shooting spree that left her with a bullet in her jaw , killed a dozen people , and traumatized a community			1
" i saw him and he 's just this freak lookin ' dude with some orange hair , " the 17 - year - old high school student said , calling suspect @entity17 " pathetic looking			1
" " you could feel in the room all the anger that everyone had for him , " she said			1
" everyone in @entity25 hates this guy			2
" she wants him to get the death penalty			0
" he tried to kill people , " @entity3 said			1
" so i think he needs to be killed			0
" @entity3 was in the theater next door to the one in which a gunman opened fire at a midnight showing of the new @entity39 movie on friday in @entity40			1
why did suspect avoid social media ? one of the bullets -- she thinks it was early in the shooting spree -- pierced the wall and entered the theater she was in , slashing through her mouth and becoming lodged in her jaw			1
it will stay there forever , in the lower left part of her jaw			1
doctors tell her that removing it would cause too much nerve damage			2
" i like the idea			0
i think it 's cool that i have a bullet in my chin , " she said with a smile , calling it " a souvenir			2
" she considers herself lucky to be alive , and not injured worse			0
@entity67 helped save her that night , and was in court with her monday			0
" it made it hit home , " she said			0
" it was n't just a picture on the tv anymore			0
" " i just want him to be where he 's never going to be able to hurt someone again			0
" opinion : mass murder and powerful guns @entity3 said that when she was shot , she did n't know what had happened			1
she started bleeding , but " thought someone had thrown something at me			0
and when i got up to leave the theater everyone else was still sitting down			2
so i was really upset , like , ' who 's personally doing this to me ? ' " " then we saw the victims from @entity88 -- and i realized it was n't just me			2
" @entity67 , who will begin college in the fall , helped her out of the building , pulled a fire alarm , called 911 , and helped get @entity3 seated outside on a curb			1
it was only then that she touched her face and realized there was a bullet in her			2
" it changed me as a person , " she said , adding , " i just do n't take people for granted -- especially the ones that save your life			1
" " being in a real life - or - death situation , " she said , helped her realize that " the little things do n't matter			0
it shows you what really does matter			0
