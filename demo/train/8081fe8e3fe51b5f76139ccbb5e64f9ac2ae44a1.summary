-- if you 've ever been hit with one , you know how an unexpected " resort fee " can take your breath away			0
at up to $ 30 a night , the dollars quickly add up when you spend a few nights in a hotel that charges a mandatory fee for amenities that might include the use of the property 's gym or pool			2
the element of surprise that accompanies some of these mandatory fees has caught the attention of the @entity17 , which recently sent a letter to 22 hotel operators warning that their online rate quotes may be deceptive and in violation of @entity17 regulations			1
the commission found that some of the hotel operators it addressed list only the room rate and taxes in online rate quotes , while listing mandatory fees separately either nearby or on another page , while other hotels list the fees in fine print or do n't list additional fees at all , indicating only that other fees may apply			1
hotels ready for the @entity39 " these practices may violate the law by misrepresenting the price consumers can expect to pay for their hotel rooms , " the commission 's letter to hoteliers said			2
" we believe that online hotel reservation sites should include in the quoted total price any unavoidable or mandatory fees , such as resort fees , that consumers will be charged to stay at the hotel			1
" the @entity17 declined to name the hotel operators that received the letter			1
" this is the first time the @entity17 has publicly stated its position that it is deceptive for the hotels not to include mandatory fees as part of the total price they quote			1
we want to give the hotel operators an opportunity to come into compliance voluntarily before naming them publicly , " said commission spokeswoman @entity63 via e-mail			2
a hotel for every taste : @entity71 's top 100 charging mandatory fees for amenities that are included at many hotels is a balancing act for hoteliers , according to @entity76 , a professor of hotel management at @entity78			2
hotels make money on resort fees , but they can lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of business , he said via e-mail			0
" guest satisfaction is a very costly issue for hotels to deal with since ( consumers ) have so many choices and brand loyalty is fleeting at best , " @entity76 said			0
guests who are surprised by fees when the bill arrives can be especially troubled by them			0
the trade commission encouraged the hotel operators to review their online price quoting procedures warning that the @entity17 " may take action to enforce and seek redress for any violations of the @entity103 as the public interest may require			1
" so guests will still have to pay the fees , but chances are , you 'll know about them before the bill is slipped under the door			0
