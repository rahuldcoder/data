-- @entity2 opposition leaders have dubbed friday 's planned demonstrations " friday of @entity4 , " a prominent @entity5 who commanded one of the first rebellions against the @entity9 mandate of @entity2 in the early part of the 20th century			1
some opposition activists said they hope the name prompts the powerful minority ruling class , which is composed primarily of @entity5 , to join the demonstrations demanding the fall of the regime			2
they also say the name sends the message that their demands are not directed against @entity5 , but against the regime			2
government opponents accuse the regime of identifying them as an @entity24 movement , which they deny			0
the plans came as @entity2 refugees continued thursday to flee across the @entity28 border to escape violence , as world powers amplified their outrage over the @entity34 regime 's tough crackdown on peaceful demonstrators			1
the number of @entity2 refugees now in @entity28 stands at 8,904 , @entity28 emergency officials said			1
their report comes a day after @entity28 government officials , including @entity28 prime minister @entity41 and foreign minister @entity42 , met with a special @entity2 envoy to help stem the growing tide of refugees			1
violence in the country and an offensive in and around the town of @entity50 spurred thousands of people to make their way to the border region , and @entity28 officials are worried that the crisis could deteriorate and destabilize the area			2
@entity42 met thursday with @entity2 envoy @entity57 , who also sat down on wednesday with @entity41			0
the foreign minister briefed the news media in @entity60 about the border crisis , the @entity28 meeting with the @entity2 envoy , and his visit with @entity2 refugees on wednesday in the @entity28 city of @entity67			1
" it was a meeting that was very comprehensive in which everything was openly discussed , based on mutual confidence and a joint understanding of sharing matters , " @entity42 said of the meeting with @entity57 and his delegation			0
calling for a " strong , stable and prosperous @entity2 , " @entity42 urged the timely development of a " comprehensive reform process " there and an end to the discord in @entity2			0
" i hope the positive scenario of introducing reforms and eliminating violence will take place , " he said			0
" i do n't even want to think about the other scenario			0
" he said @entity28 will provide humanitarian help to @entity2 massed on the @entity2 side of the border			2
many @entity2 who have fled their homes have n't crossed into @entity28 and have instead lived near the border in grim conditions			2
" @entity28 will never refrain from any help for @entity2 , " @entity42 said			2
on wednesday , the @entity93 human rights office called for " a thorough probe into the allegations of widespread abuses committed by @entity2 authorities during their violent crackdown			1
" " the most egregious reports concern the use of live ammunition against unarmed civilians , including from snipers positioned on rooftops of public buildings , and the deployment of tanks in areas densely populated by civilians , " according to a preliminary report prepared by the @entity111			0
" as of mid-june , the number of those killed during such incidents is believed to have exceeded 1,100 persons , many of them unarmed civilians ; among them were women and children , " it said , according to a @entity93 statement			0
the human rights office said reports indicate that up to 10,000 people have been detained over three months , and security forces " have perpetrated acts of torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment against detainees , resulting in death in custody in some cases			1
" the report , which covers the period from march 15 to wednesday , is based on data from @entity93 agencies , human rights activists , a small number of victims and witnesses , and various other groups			1
the human rights office said it had to rely on these sources because it has n't been able to get its own staffers into @entity2			1
there also have been reports that the rights of people to freedom " of assembly , expression , and movement " and to get food and health care have been violated			0
" the material currently before the high commissioner is a matter of grave concern and reflects a dire human rights situation in the @entity2 , " the report said			1
" the alleged breaches of the most fundamental rights on such a broad scale require thorough investigation and , with respect to the perpetrators , full accountability			0
" @entity166 , the high commissioner for human rights , urged @entity2 " to grant access to the country for the fact - finding mission established by the @entity170			1
" more than 50 nations issued a tough statement on human rights abuses in @entity2 at the @entity170 on wednesday , and the @entity174 underscored the thrust of the message thursday			1
" the international community has been shocked by the horrific reports of torture and arbitrary arrests , and widespread use of violence against peaceful protesters , " said @entity174 spokeswoman @entity177			0
" this outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end now			0
" the @entity174 called on @entity2 to allow the high commissioner 's office to pursue its mission			2
@entity0 's @entity192 and @entity193 contributed to this report			0
