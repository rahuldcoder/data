@entity0 -- @entity3 government employees received improper gifts from energy industry representatives , and engaged with them in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations , according to a report issued wednesday			1
a report says government officials accepted gifts from oil and gas company employees			1
the report was issued by the @entity15 's inspector general after a $ 5.3 million investigation " uncovered recreational marijuana and cocaine use " by " a handful " of @entity15 staff , and found two federal employees " engaged in brief sexual relationships with representatives from companies doing business " with the department			1
two @entity15 employees " received combined gifts and gratuities on at least 135 occasions from four major oil and gas companies with whom they were doing business -- a textbook example of improperly receiving gifts from prohibited sources , " inspector general @entity27 says in a letter to interior secretary @entity29 accompanying the report			1
@entity43 , head of the @entity44 at the @entity15 , said the public had not suffered financial losses as a result of the employees ' behavior			1
some of the government employees tried to hide their close association with the industry they were supposed to be regulating , the report says			1
the investigation turned up e-mails in which @entity44 employees " preparing to attend industry events used such language as ' this trip is to be kept quiet , ' or were asked to @entity60 ' in private ' by their supervisor , " the report says			2
" when we asked one of these employees why they needed to avoid discussing their social activities with industry , he responded with a slight chuckle , ' they might have , you know , contacted the [ inspector general ] , ' " the report says			1
the investigation appears to have been prompted by an internal whistle - blower 's report in 2006 , and concerns activity from 2002 to 2006 by the department responsible for selling the oil and gas the government collects as rent from companies drilling on federal lands			1
the report alleges inappropriate behavior by 19 members of the royalty in @entity85 -- about one - third of the department			0
some have since left the department , making it unclear what kind of disciplinary action they could be subject to			0
the @entity90 declined to prosecute two former employees named in the report , the inspector general said , without saying why			1
another pleaded guilty to a criminal charge			0
@entity90 spokeswoman @entity95 said the department did receive " one or more referrals related to matters referenced in the @entity15 inspector general reports , " but she declined to comment further			1
@entity44 head @entity43 said only " six or seven " employees named in the report still work for the department			2
he vowed appropriate action by the time he leaves office in january			0
democrats used the report to accuse president @entity107 's administration of being too close to the oil industry			1
" the @entity107 administration put an ' @entity117 ' sign on the @entity119 lawn from day one and has been courting @entity121 ever since , " rep. @entity109 , @entity111 - @entity110 and chairwoman of the @entity113 , said in a written statement			1
" democrats have been saying it for some time , but this proves it			0
this administration is literally in bed with @entity121			0
little did we know they were such a cheap date			0
" sen. @entity130 , a @entity132 @entity131 , said the report should make @entity134 reconsider plans to expand offshore drilling			0
" the rest of the @entity3 government does n't need to jump in bed with " the oil industry , he said			2
" offshore drilling will not solve our energy crisis nor will it bring down prices at the pump , " @entity130 said			0
" instead , it will enrich the oil companies and reward the culture of corruption that has been fostered , funded and now exposed by the inspector general			1
" house speaker @entity150 , @entity151 , said in a statement : " this report documents the ' pervasive culture of exclusivity ' that has cheated the @entity3 taxpayer out of the billions of dollars owed them by the oil companies , " @entity150 said			2
sen. @entity158 , @entity159 , called the allegations in the report " unacceptable			0
" @entity119 minority leader @entity161 , a @entity162 from @entity163 and an advocate of easing drilling rules , said that in 2006 , " our members on the @entity167 were investigating this problem in the department			0
" " our members of the last two years ... have been pushing [ current ] chairman [ rep. @entity172 to continue this investigation and to have hearings and he 's refused to do it , " @entity161 said			0
@entity172 is a @entity131 from @entity159			0
two oil companies mentioned in the report , @entity176 and @entity177 , declined to comment , saying they still needed to review it			2
a third , @entity182 , said in a statement : " we do not believe we are the focus of the investigation and we will cooperate with any further requests from the inspector general 's office that may arise			2
" @entity1 's @entity189 and @entity190 contributed to this report .			0
