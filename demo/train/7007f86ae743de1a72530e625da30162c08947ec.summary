in the @entity1 , a person dies every 19 minutes from a prescription drug overdose			1
many of those deaths are attributed to a family of painkillers known as opioids			2
in an effort to reduce abuse , the @entity8 announced on tuesday that it " is invoking its authority to require safety labeling changes and post-market studies to combat the crisis of misuse , abuse , addiction , overdose and death from these potent drugs that have harmed too many patients and devastated too many families and communities , " according to a press release			1
the label changes are meant for extended - release or long - acting opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone , among others			1
@entity8 commissioner dr. @entity31 told reporters : " these drugs are at the heart of the abuse epidemic			2
but we must recognize the medical use they have			0
" currently , the labels on the drugs say they are for " the relief of moderate to severe pain in patients requiring continuous , around - the - clock opioid treatment for an extended period of time			0
" to discourage over-use and misuse of the drugs , the new labels will say the drugs should be used only when " alternative treatment options are inadequate			1
" while the label changes are something physicians should be aware of , the @entity8 said it hopes this will result in a larger conversation about pain management between patients and doctors			0
the @entity8 expects to finalize the new labeling requirements by the end of this year .			0

prescription drugs are common cause of drug overdose deaths
opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone are often the cause
@entity8 *proposes* labels to discourage over-use and misuse of the drugs
