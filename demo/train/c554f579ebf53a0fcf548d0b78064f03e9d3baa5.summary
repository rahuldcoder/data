-- a former high school cheerleader who sued over injuries caused when a teammate failed to catch her during a routine , lost her appeal before the @entity6 on tuesday			1
the @entity6 ruled tuesday a cheerleader could n't sue her teammate			0
the seven state justices unanimously concluded cheerleading is a " contact " sport , and therefore neither the male student cited nor the school district was liable for damages			1
the opinion also said the stunt in question did not create a " compelling danger " to students			1
it is the first legal decision of its kind , according to the @entity24 , a group founded by parents			1
the case was closely watched by school districts and parents around the country concerned about whether they would have immunity from lawsuits involving unintentional injuries from certain extracurricular activities			0
@entity35 was a varsity cheerleader at @entity36 , about 14 miles from @entity37 , in western @entity38			1
her team was practicing a " post to hands " stunt before a basketball game in 2004 , and after being lifted up to stand on the shoulders of a fellow student , @entity35 fell backward , striking her head on the floor			1
the 16 - year - old male cheerleader who lifted her , and then was supposed to be a spotter , failed to catch her			0
the girl 's family sued the boy and the school district , claiming the coach was negligent by not having a second spotter and not providing safety mats			1
state law does not specifically spell out which high school activities involve " contact , " but they typically involve sports such as football or lacrosse in which opposing teams compete against each other			2
but the @entity38 high court concluded that " cheerleading involves a significant amount of physical contact between cheerleaders that at times results in a forceful interaction between the participants			2
" justice @entity77 cited the " spirit rules " of the @entity79 of @entity81 's handbook , which contained pictures illustrating various cheerleading stunts			0
she said all but one photo showed at least two cheerleaders in contact with one another			0
because the male cheerleader just made a mistake by being out of place when @entity35 fell , the court found he did not act " recklessly , " the only legal standard that would have permitted a lawsuit to proceed			1
although it is not considered a sport at many high schools and colleges , cheerleading has grown increasingly popular over the years , and the stunts have become more complex and dangerous , sports injury experts say			2
a @entity101 study found cheerleading accounted for about two - thirds of some 93 " catastrophic " sports injuries -- including head and neck damage -- among high school girls in the past 26 years			2
but the study noted that other sports such as football produce far more devastating injuries , though fewer in number			0
cheerleading advocates say the activity has become much safer in the past 15 years , following greater awareness of the risks and better coordination among state and national groups			0
the @entity118 estimates about 4 million people are involved in the activity .			0

justices rule cheerleading is " contact " sport , therefore teammates , school not liable
@entity35 sued claiming negligence after she fell during a stunt
opinion said stunt in question did not create a " compelling danger "
