@entity0 , @entity1 -- for @entity5 , shaking @entity4 's hand is the biggest single step yet on his road from feared paramilitary commander to politician			1
it 's a transformation that has taken place over decades : from the shaggy - haired , scrawny commander of @entity14 ( @entity14 ) gunmen in the early 1970s , to the deputy first minister of @entity1 's power - sharing government , where he represents @entity18 , the province 's most popular , mainly @entity19 , @entity22 party opposed to @entity24 rule			1
in his home city of @entity27 i saw that fear firsthand while shooting a documentary about him a little over a decade ago			0
@entity5 had long been rumored to have had a direct hand in the killing of an @entity14 man turned informer			1
i visited the man 's mother , who lived just a few streets away from @entity5 's modest terraced house in the city 's notorious @entity40 neighborhood			1
the killing had allegedly taken place decades earlier but the man 's mother was still too afraid to talk			2
@entity4 arrives in @entity1 on jubilee visit @entity27 , as he would call his city , or @entity27 , as the province 's mainly @entity49 , pro-british loyalists refer to it , was where @entity5 first tried his hand at politics			1
while shooting the documentary i met with one of his former political colleagues who also was a secret agent for the @entity24 government			0
he had been pulled out and relocated to mainland @entity24 when his cover was blown a long time ago , but he told me he warned his @entity24 government handlers that @entity5 's early ballot box victories were a fraud : countless ballots cast in clear infringement of the law			1
royal boost for peace process he says his handlers turned a blind eye , and he concluded even at that early stage , 10 years after violence broke out , that @entity24 government officials had calculated @entity5 was someone they wanted in a suit and tie at the table talking to them , and not on the streets waging war			2
as i concluded that documentary , i struggled to balance all i had seen with the question , is this transition reversible ? @entity82 committed to peace ? back then , the @entity14 had still not decommissioned its weapons , and the door seemed open to a return to violence			2
later @entity5 's @entity18 colleagues told me i 'd set him up for assassination as a leader who 'd used back channels to secretly negotiate peace with the @entity24 government			1
i was told " we expected something more like @entity97 , " but that was a leap of faith i did n't have the evidence to take			0
dislike for @entity5 is not limited to those on the opposite side of the sectarian divide			1
his readiness to make peace with the @entity24 -- never mind shake the queen 's hand -- has made him some powerful enemies in his own mainly @entity19 community			2
when @entity5 and the @entity14 gave up their guns , even more extreme republicans picked up where they left off			1
the @entity14 has continued , its hard core of supporters making bombs and killing policemen			2
in the @entity27 streets where @entity5 still lives , violent vigilante gangs mete out their own informal justice on the community , shooting drug pushers			0
they boast more arms than the @entity14 ever had , and have filled the void left as @entity5 and the social order the @entity14 enforced fade into the past			1
meeting the queen means @entity5 loses the legitimacy of hardcore @entity22 -- he can no longer sway them as he once did			1
so while he 'll still call for the @entity24 government to investigate its own actions of brutality , collusion with @entity49 paramilitaries and the alleged shoot - to - kill policy of @entity14 volunteers , his calls will ring hollow for some			0
but all along , @entity5 's every move , from @entity14 commander , to deputy first minister , seems to have been an ever - more calculated step			1
the vast majority of nationalists -- and everyone else in @entity1 , for that matter -- only ever wanted a fair deal , peace , jobs and a good education for their children			0
@entity5 seems to have read that well			0
an @entity14 military victory over " @entity151 " was never really an option			0
it was a dream whose time came and went riding on the back of bigotry , sectarian violence , social injustice and the civil rights movement of the late 1960s			0
the @entity161 - backed governments in @entity0 had long run roughshod over nationalist , mainly @entity19 aspirations			0
in a handshake , @entity5 will banish that to the history books for ever			2
an acknowledgment sealed in a formality that the violent divided past should be laid to rest			0
for a man of peace -- which is how @entity5 wants to be remembered -- he has come a long way , and so have the nationalists of @entity175			0
when a handshake is not just a handshake			0

@entity1 's deputy first minister @entity5 meets the queen
@entity5 is a former commander of the @entity14 , or @entity14
handshake between the pair marks *symbolic* *end* to decades of sectarian conflict
