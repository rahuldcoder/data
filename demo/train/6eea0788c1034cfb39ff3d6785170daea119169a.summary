-- first it was the airlines , now it 's the turn of hotels to take the budget concept into the mainstream			2
demand is surging for cheaper hotel rooms , not just from thrifty tourists but also from business travelers in search of value			1
and budget brands are responding to the demand with ambitious expansion plans			1
not just for backpackers : @entity15 opened its first budget hotel in 2005 targeting short - stay tourists			2
other brands are improving the service to woo business travelers			1
according to recent research from market analyst @entity23 , the @entity25 budget hotel market increased by 38 percent between 2002 and 2006 , to reach Â£ 1 billion			1
this growth was three times that of the overall @entity25 hotel market			1
and while top - end establishments prepare for a decline as consumer spending falls , budget hotels are determined they are recession resilient			1
research from @entity37 for @entity38 last year predicted the budget sector will grow by a further 10 percent in the next five years			2
by 2027 it will account for over a quarter of the total supply of hotels in the @entity25 with almost 850,000 rooms			2
in the @entity45 , budget hotels already account for 33 percent of the supply and 24 percent in @entity47 , says the report			1
@entity49 , the 500 - strong @entity25 budget chain ( that added 2,500 rooms to its portfolio last year and plans to add another 3,500 this year ) is now taking the budget model further afield			2
in march the chain , owned by @entity55 , will unveil a hotel in @entity57 and it is currently scouring @entity58 for sites			0
the boom in budget hotels has been greatest in @entity62			1
here both businessmen and tourists , foreign and domestic , are relishing the arrival of rooms that cost less than $ 50 a night			0
there are nearly 100 economic hotel chain brands in @entity62 , over 1,000 budget hotels with over 100,000 rooms			1
brands are both local and from overseas including @entity73 's @entity72 and @entity75 's @entity74			0
more budget rooms are likely to emerge this year in the build - up to the @entity78 in @entity79 in august			0
@entity80 , the largest budget hotel chain in mainland @entity62 , has built 400 hotels in just five years			1
they plan to grow this to more than 1,000 hotels in three to four years in cities across @entity62 as well as further afield in @entity87			2
in @entity89 , @entity88 , senior travel analyst at @entity23 said the arrival of boutique and lifestyle brands such as @entity93 , the @entity94 and base2stay raised the game of the sector by providing an affordable but luxurious alternative			1
new capsule hotels such as @entity100 and nitenite also helped boost the market , he added			2
the increased interest from business travelers in value from hotels has been a further boost			1
according to a recent study by @entity111 / @entity110 business travelers spent 1.5 million nights in budget hotels in the @entity25 in 2006 , up from 0.93 million in 2000 and only 0.38 million in 1994			1
in the @entity45 , 74 percent of travel managers that responded to a @entity116 survey last year said their business travelers now frequently use economy - type hotels			1
and although first - class properties continue to be used most often , economy - type hotel use is up 31 percent from the previous four years			0
electronics firm , @entity123 spends about $ 134 million globally on hotels every year			0
currently three per cent of this is with budget chains , including @entity73 's @entity72 and @entity127			0
this may sound small , says @entity129 , @entity123 ' senior sourcing specialist for hotels , but it adds up to an impressive $ 3.7 million every year			0
and that figure is rising , he adds			0
travelers choosing the budget option , says @entity129 , are not just from lower down the organizational ranks			2
managers and even executives conscious of cost are also making the switch			0
as @entity129 says , it all comes down to a perception of value			0
" travelers come back from a trip to @entity145 having paid more than $ 300 for a lousy room that has n't been renovated in ages and they do n't see the worth			0
but they come back from a @entity127 , which is brand new , and they are more than happy			0
" @entity123 is also making increased use of serviced guest apartments -- particularly in countries such as @entity58 -- that offer the same level of quality as a four or five star property for a budget price			0
@entity158 , travel sourcing manager , @entity159 at @entity160 says while budget may not be an option in @entity159 , where they pay a premium for security at top end hotels , the communications firm is considering budget options in @entity89 and the @entity45 where quality is better			1
" of course business travelers would prefer to stay in a five or four star hotel given the choice , " she acknowledges			1
" but if the reasons given are good enough , and we choose somewhere where the standard is acceptable and it is in a good location , then they accept it			0
" @entity177 , marketing director at @entity49 believes budget hotels offer a genuine alternative to mid-market hotels with the same convenience and quality but at better value			1
" every guest bedroom gets refurbished every 24 months which is extremely frequent compared to the wider hotel industry , " says @entity184			0
@entity49 is also refurbishing rooms to a higher quality than some mid-market chains , he says			0
following the acquisition of a chain of mid-market hotels last year , they invested a further $ 10 million to meet their " budget " standards			2
all desks and chairs in rooms are ergonomically designed , desks are cleared of clutter and @entity203 is available in every hotel			0
some @entity49 also feature meeting space for business travelers as well as branches of @entity208 also owned by parent company @entity55			2
" business customers are responding well to these and using them as meeting places , " says @entity184			0
so with recession looming could this be the end of @entity216 sheets and luxury saunas for business travelers ? perhaps not , but in cities where rates continue to increase even for poorest quality rooms , the budget option may not be as bad as all that			1

growth of budget hotels has been three times that of overall hotel market
demand is strong among tourists and business travelers in @entity89 @entity45 and @entity62
boutique budget brands have helped raise the *profile* of the economical option
