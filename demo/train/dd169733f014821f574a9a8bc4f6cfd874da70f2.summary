the @entity0 has seen its star dim somewhat since its launch in november 2012			1
worldwide sales numbers for the console have been disappointing and some gamers have complained that the number of desirable games for the system has n't grown quickly enough			2
however , the man who brought to life @entity12 legends like @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 is preaching patience with the console , saying the @entity0 , with its touchscreen controller that augments big - screen play , is so different that it will take time for people to understand its real value			1
@entity24 is @entity12 's most successful video game designer , creating some of the world 's most popular franchises with " @entity15 , " " @entity28 , " " @entity29 " and " @entity30 " before eventually turning his attention to the @entity0 and @entity32			1
through a translator , @entity24 told @entity34 that having a second screen for gaming in the living room is a new experience for gamers			2
he said the touchscreen interface with the @entity41 controller , combined with the main - screen action on a television , opens up options that have never been possible			0
" the challenge that we had was if someone wanted to view television , then you could n't play games			0
we wanted to have a second screen for @entity0 that would make it possible for people to essentially play games even if something else was on the tv , " @entity24 said			1
skepticism about the @entity0 sounds familiar , @entity24 said			1
when @entity12 released its now - popular handheld @entity61 portable gaming system in 2004 , lots of early reviews predicted it would fail			1
" there was a period when we first released the @entity65 that people would say there 's no way people can look at two screens at once , " he said			0
" i almost feel like , as people get more familiar with @entity0 and these touchscreen interfaces , that there is going to come a point where they feel like ' i ca n't do everything i want to do if i do n't have a second screen '			2
" review : @entity0 -- a tale of two screens with the inclusion of nongaming apps for the @entity0 , the gaming console appears to be positioning itself as a hub for more than just games			1
@entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 apps all point to offering more variety in entertainment without having to change devices			0
@entity24 said that while the @entity0 does offer more choices for families , it does n't necessarily need to be the center of entertainment			1
" i feel a device like @entity0 , with its ability to continue to offer new features and that network connection and the connection to the tv and the interface , really makes it feel that it 's more than just a game machine , but something that offers a lot of practical use and practical purpose in the living room , " he said			2
" i look at it as being a very useful device that can do many different things and therefore really seems to be the device that 's ideal to have in the living room			0
" problems with updates and console crashes plagued the @entity0 early on			1
@entity24 agrees there is room for improvement in some facets of the @entity0 , but points out that @entity12 is working on solutions sooner rather than later			1
" our immediate objective over the next few months is to improve the @entity0 system and make it a little more stable , a little bit more convenient to use from a system standpoint , " @entity24 said			1
" @entity128 ( a sort of social network that lets players interact ) is an example of an ongoing project			0
we really wanted to be able to leverage @entity134 in something like ' @entity136 ' we 're obviously still early on in it and just trying things out , but so far , it does feel like the community itself is doing a very good job of being a warm and welcoming place for people			0
" " the other thing i think about is how do we begin getting people to understand that and convey the usefulness of @entity0 to them			2
for me as a game developer , obviously i look at @entity0 from the perspective of what games i can bring to @entity0 " in the short term , @entity24 said " @entity153 " and " @entity29 : the @entity158 " will be released for the @entity0 and other games that bring a @entity156 style of play will also be released later this year			1
@entity12 announced 2013 as the @entity159 and plans to release several games featuring @entity13 's little brother prominently			1
it also happens to be the 30th year since @entity159 first appeared in the original " @entity163 " arcade game			2
" @entity164 : @entity168 " for the @entity32 is the first of these titles to highlight the timid plumber			0
@entity24 said he wanted to display how different @entity159 is from @entity13 while at the same time upgrading the first @entity170 game with a second screen			1
" the original @entity170 game was sort of a mix -- these ghost events and exploration of the mansion , " @entity24 said			2
" but with the map there now ( on the second screen ) and to always see the map as you are exploring , the exploration feature and really exploring the mansion itself takes on a much bigger role in this game			0
" he also let slip that another historic character will be making an appearance in the game			0
" @entity189 ( a recurring @entity191 character ) does make some appearances			0
maybe i 'm not supposed to say that			0
( laughs ) it 's going to be very fun when @entity189 appears			0
" when looking to the future of the video games industry , @entity24 sees the promise of continued success			1
he points out that video games are now something everyone expects to exist instead of just a phase or fad of entertainment			0
" the fact that we 've reached an age where video games are being received the way they are just makes me very grateful , " @entity24 said			2
" there was a time when people always asked , when is the video game boom going to end ? we 've reached a stage where there 's no longer a question of when the boom 's going to end			0
" it is simply : there are video games			0
