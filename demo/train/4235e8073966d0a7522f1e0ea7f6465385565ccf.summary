@entity0 , @entity1 -- that morning in march 1968 played out like a @entity4 movie : a secret @entity6 radar station on the top of a mountain in @entity9 , manned by a small group of @entity12 airmen , is overrun by @entity14 soldiers			1
one by one , @entity15 are killed until only four remain			0
as the sun peeks above the jungle , an @entity15 helicopter drops a rescue sling while hovering over the remaining airmen			2
chief master sgt. @entity22 loads the wounded @entity15 one by one into the chopper before climbing in himself			1
as the helicopter roars off , a stray bullet pierces it and hits @entity22			2
the men he saved would make it home , but @entity22 would n't			2
he died on the floor of the chopper as it headed off to safety			0
except that is where this story really begins for @entity36			2
in his last memory of that day , @entity22 is alive and hoisting @entity36 , who was shot in both legs , into the helicopter			1
@entity36 passed out , and it was n't until he woke up at @entity41 in @entity42 that he learned that his friend @entity43 had died saving his life			1
today , @entity22 posthumously received the @entity45 , the military 's highest award for bravery			1
his family accepted the award from president @entity51 at a @entity53 ceremony			0
@entity36 has struggled to make sense of the randomness of that day			1
" it 's a matter of inches			2
it could have been anybody , or nobody , " he said			0
" when a round comes through the bottom of a helicopter , it does n't know who it 's going to hit			2
" but it was @entity66 and not @entity36 who died that day , and ever since , @entity36 has wondered why fate spared him			1
" it was a burden , " he explained			0
" you say , ' why me ? why am i still alive ? the rest of them are dead , how did i manage to make it out alive ? ' " you never know who is going or who is not going , but i know i would have gone if it had n't of been for @entity43 getting me onto that chopper			0
" now 71 , @entity36 has lived a good life			1
he stayed in the @entity12 until 1979 , then spent a few years in the electronics business before opening a bar and doing some accounting			0
now he is mostly retired			0
he was present at the @entity53 on tuesday when @entity51 gave the @entity45 to @entity22 's family			1
he lives in a tidy home in small - town @entity1 with his wife			2
he has three grown kids , 13 grandchildren and one great - grandchild			1
" i have one grandchild to carry on my status			2
he 's in the @entity12 , active duty , " he said			0
a framed photo of that grandson , airman 1st @entity94 , sits on a shelf in the living room alongside a painting depicting his grandfather being hoisted into the helicopter as @entity22 looks on : an artist 's rendering of his last memory of @entity22			1
@entity36 knows that if not for the bravery of @entity22 42 years ago , it could easily be someone else sitting in this living room , living this life			1
" i do n't know why me , but it is , " he said			0
" and @entity43 's presence is in my life every day			1
" he said he thinks back often to his last moments with @entity66			0
" i said ' @entity43 , @entity43 , we 're not going to get out of here ! ' and he says , ' i know , say your last prayers , that 's all you can do			0
' " @entity36 's prayers were answered that day in @entity9			1
today , he prays for the wisdom to make good on a debt he can never repay			0
" it has to be that @entity120 is not done with me on the face of the earth yet			0
thanks to @entity66 , i 'm still alive to do something , " he said .			0
