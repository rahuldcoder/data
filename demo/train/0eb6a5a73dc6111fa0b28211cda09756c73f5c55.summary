" the @entity4 responded with more requests to amendments to the protocol ; they did not reject or accept , " he said			2
the finance and economic ministers of the @entity2 will meet saturday to draft economic sanctions that will be discussed sunday by the @entity2 's foreign ministers , said the diplomat , who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the negotiations			1
these could include halting dealings with @entity4 's central bank and airlines , the official said			1

" in @entity52 , a representative of @entity51 said the @entity62 secretary - general " welcomes the efforts of the @entity2 to end the bloodshed and promote a political solution " and urged @entity4 authorities to agree to the league 's proposal to send an observer mission to protect civilians in @entity4			1

reliable sources indicate the abuses " are allegedly conducted under direct orders from public authorities , at their instigation or with their consent or acquiescence , " @entity102 said			0

human rights issues should not be used as a justification for action by the @entity143 , he said			0
" under no circumstances must human rights issues be used as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a state , in this particular instance , @entity4 , " @entity136 said , quoted by the @entity138 news agency @entity144			2
" a scenario involving military intervention in @entity4 affairs is absolutely unacceptable for us			2
