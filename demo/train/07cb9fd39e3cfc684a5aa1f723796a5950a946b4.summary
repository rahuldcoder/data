-- leadership is one of those nebulous terms -- you hear it all the time but it has various definitions			1
the traits that make up a good leader can vary depending on the organization , team , manager and work environment			1
leadership can also vary in style -- are you someone who dictates the group and does n't listen to anyone else 's opinion ? or do you lead with a more bureaucratic or democratic style ? " every leader has a particular style of leadership that is innate			1
however , the behaviors , attitudes or methods of delivery that are effective for one staff member may in fact be counterproductive for another , " says @entity21 , account supervisor , @entity22 , a public relations firm			2
" great leaders are aware of their own style and make the effort to learn how their style actually comes across to their team			1
they learn to flex their leadership style to individual team members so that they communicate and behave in ways that motivate and inspire			1
" here is what five leadership professionals consider to be traits that make up a good leader : @entity44 , vice president of media relations , @entity46 , a public relations agency 1			1
always do the honest thing			2
it makes employees feel like they know where they stand with you at all times			0
know where you 're going and have a strong stated mission to lead people on			0
if you 're not sure , how can your people be sure ? you have to have strong focus and stay the course			0
whatever it is , you must have passion for what you 're doing			0
live , breathe , eat and sleep your mission			0
not playing favorites with people and treating all people -- no matter what station in life , what class or what rank in the org chart -- the same			0
people have to believe in you and your credibility			0
image is everything and the belief people have in you , your product , your mission , your facts or your reputation are key to being a great leader			1
you have to persuade people of this -- it does n't just happen			1
@entity90 , a leadership and workplace coach , @entity93 1			1
if you do n't believe in yourself , no one will			1
i hear leaders worrying that if they show too much confidence , others will think them arrogant			1
the reality is people want to know what you know for sure -- and what you do n't			1
having the confidence to say " i do n't know " is a powerful skill			1
the only way you can get confidence is by becoming really , really clear about who you are and what is most important to you			1
new leaders fail when they try to become all things to all people , or try to do too much out of their area of excellence			1
clarity helps you say " yes " to the right things -- and " no " to others			0
the strongest , most effective leaders i 've met care not just about the business , but about the people in it and the people impacted by it			1
plus , they show they care through their words and actions , even proving how they care for themselves and their family by taking unplugged vacations and continuing their own professional development			0
care should n't be a four - letter word in our workplace today -- and the best leaders know it			1
@entity142 , co-founder , @entity143 , a recruitment firm 1			0
they are people who are respected and worth listening to			0
i find in general due to all of the economic difficulties , employees prioritize and seek leaders and organizations that are honest and meet their commitments			1
too many leaders these days manage with the balance sheet , often times at the expense of their employees and long - term customer relationships			1
talented people want to work for leaders and organizations that truly care about their employees and the communities in which they operate			1
people produce real business gains and smart people need to understand what is needed and be part of the solution			0
great business leaders are able to get all members of their teams engaged			2
they do this by offering them challenge , seeking their ideas and contributions and providing them with recognition for their contributions			0
in today 's work environment , people are working very long hours and they need to take some time to celebrate their successes in order to recharge their batteries			0
those leaders who fail to do this create burnout environment overtime			2
@entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , and author of " @entity198 " 1			1
true leaders have confidence but realize the point at which it becomes hubris			1
true leaders make their associates feel emboldened and powerful , not diminished and powerless			1
true leaders solicit input and feedback from those around them so that everyone feels part of the process			1
true leaders share their vision or strategy often with those around them			1
true leaders are not afraid to take risks or make mistakes			1
true leaders make mistakes born from risk			1
@entity220 , author of " 18 @entity221 " 1			2
you need to be clear on what your values are and must be consistent in applying them			0
as part of that , you need to have the courage to hold true to them			2
you must not lose sight of reality			0
lost values may be one of the biggest causes of downfalls			0

many unsophisticated leaders think everyone should be like them ; that too can cause their downfall			2

part of awareness is do n't expect people to change			2
if you think you can change someone , think again			0

but do n't expect to change anyone ( even yourself ) behaviorally			2
we are who we are			0
your job as a leader is to understand each person 's strengths and place them in positions where they can flourish and grow			2
if you are good at that , you have a huge part of the equation for success			2
going from individual contributor to supervisor is only the first of many transitions along the leadership pipeline			2
you need to understand the business model , how it applies to your current position , what you need to do to provide the greatest value , and how to leverage your strengths at this level			0
this requires building competencies and focusing on the right things			0
no one ever tells you that there are many levels and many adjustments you need to make along the way			2
you need to foster a positive environment that allows your team to flourish			0
