the talented , charismatic and handsome @entity0 brilliantly ushered this year 's @entity2 through the potential landmines of political commentary and irreverent humor			1
indeed , from hosting many of the entertainment world 's most prestigious award shows , to posing on the recent cover of @entity11 with his husband @entity12 , it 's nearly impossible not to see @entity0 front and center somewhere			1
all of which makes it hard to remember this former child star was a closeted actor afraid of being found out , not too long ago			2
in so many ways , @entity0 ' career — as well as the resurrected career of last year 's @entity2 host , @entity21 -- are reminders of how we 're learning to treat each other better			1
of how we 're learning to allow space for those who are different from us			0
with a @entity29 decision on same - sex marriage looming , @entity0 not only served as an @entity2 host , but an unspoken reminder of the work that still must be done in the name of equality			1
@entity2 night was full of such reminders			1
such as in @entity38 's sobering acceptance speech , which touched on the recent , systematic attack on @entity42 voter 's rights and the disproportionate incarceration rate for black men			2
" @entity51 said it 's an artist 's duty to reflect the times we 're in , " he said as he clutched the @entity2 he shared with @entity46 for best original song , " glory " , from the film " @entity50 "			1
" ' @entity50 ' is now because the struggle for justice is right now ... there are more black men under correctional control today than there were in slavery in 1850			0
" and during her best supporting actress ( " boyhood " ) acceptance speech , @entity67 brought @entity68 and others to their feet as she took time to criticize the gender pay gap			2
" to every woman who gave birth , to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation , we have fought for everybody else 's equal rights ... it is our time to have wage equality once and for all and equal rights for women in the @entity42 ! " she said			2
and then there was best - adapted screenplay winner @entity86 ( " @entity93 " ) , and his words of encouragement for those who feel they are on the outside looking in			0
" i would like for this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she 's weird or she 's different or she does n't fit in anywhere — yes you do , " he said			0
" i promise you do , you do			0
and when it 's your turn and you are standing on the stage please pass the same message to the next person who comes along			0
" politically inflected acceptance speeches are hardly new at the @entity2			1
but these felt different : they were not some self - important actor 's hijacking the program for a personal agenda , but rather an acknowledgement of the very real conversations we are all having right now			0
even a handful of immigration references found their way on stage as " birdman " director / screenwriter @entity118 acknowledged he followed up fellow @entity121 director @entity120 as best director			0
later , while accepting the @entity123 , @entity118 was more direct : " the ones that live in this country , who are part of the latest generation of immigrants , i just pray that they can be treated with the same dignity and respect of the ones who came before and built this incredible immigrant nation			0
fans of " @entity50 " may still be upset about the awards snubs that preceded @entity2 night for the film , which traced @entity139 's campaign for equal voting rights for black people ( the movie 's sole statue was for the song ) , but the ceremony in many ways took up the themes beautifully portrayed in the film — both spoken and unspoken .			1

@entity151 : @entity0 hosting the @entity2 was an apt *backdrop* for theme of fighting *inequality* that ran through the night
he says in acceptance speeches actors ' *advocacy* for equality -- for blacks , women , @entity163 people -- was timely , moving
