@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the man who killed 77 people in a bomb attack and gun rampage just over a year ago , was judged to be sane by a @entity1 court friday , as he was sentenced to 21 years in prison			1
@entity3 was charged with voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the attacks in @entity0 and on @entity13 on july 22 , 2011			2
the issue of @entity3 's sanity , on which mental health experts have given conflicting opinions , was central to the court 's ruling			1
@entity3 , who boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in @entity1 , wanted to be ruled sane so that his actions would n't be dismissed as those of a lunatic			1
he says he acted out of " necessity " to prevent the " islamization " of his country			0
but prosecutors had asked that @entity3 , 33 , be acquitted on the grounds of insanity , in which case he would have been held in a secure mental health unit			1
suspected @entity3 sympathizer arrested , arms seized the unanimous verdict was delivered at @entity0 district court by a panel of five judges			1
@entity3 , dressed in a dark suit and tie , had a slight smile on his face as the decision was given			2
he was sentenced to the maximum possible term of 21 years and was ordered to serve a minimum of 10 years in prison			1
the sentence could be extended , potentially indefinitely , in the future if he is considered still to pose a threat to society			0
@entity1 does not have the death penalty			0
@entity3 has said he wo n't appeal the verdict			1
the chief prosecutor also confirmed friday that the prosecution does not intend to lodge an appeal			1
@entity57 , a survivor of the @entity13 attack , told @entity2 he was glad the trial had concluded and that justice had been done			1
" it 's been an amazingly difficult process			0
it 's been a constant , constant reminder of why we have to fight extremism in every way possible , " he said of the trial			0
" we have to make sure nothing like this ever happens again			0
" the court 's judgment that @entity3 is sane means that the far - right views he espouses can be confronted in @entity1 without being dismissed as those of a madman , @entity57 said			1
" there are extremist people around , they are not insane , and we have to be able to take a proper debate with them , " he said			0
asked whether the verdict meant closure for him , @entity57 said : " this case is going to live strongly with me for the rest of my life probably			1
" send us your reaction to the verdict reading out the court 's ruling , judge @entity86 spoke of @entity3 's " manifesto , " a document published online in which he set out his ultranationalist political views			1
@entity3 claimed to belong to a far - right group called the @entity95 but the court found no evidence of its existence , the judge said			1
he described his actions as a pre-emptive attack in defense of ethnic @entity1 people and culture , the court heard			0
@entity3 trained for his attack by working out in the gym , running with a backpack filled with rocks and practicing at a shooting club , the court heard			2
he was under the influence of ephedrine , a stimulant , at the time of the attacks , and the possibility that this contributed to his behavior can not be ruled out , judge @entity109 said			0
he used meditation techniques to cut off his emotions , @entity109 said			0
in the course of the 10 - week trial , which wrapped up in june , the court heard chilling evidence from some of those who survived @entity3 's shooting spree on @entity13 , in which 69 people died -- most of them teenagers attending a @entity129 summer youth camp			1
opinion : does the internet breed killers ? in his own testimony , given without emotion , @entity3 recounted firing more bullets into teenagers who were injured and could n't escape , killing those who tried to " play dead " and driving others into the sea to drown			1
his fertilizer bomb attack against government buildings in @entity0 also killed eight people and injured many more			0
it was only luck that more people were not killed and hurt in the blast , the court heard			0
@entity3 blames politicians , and the @entity129 in particular , for promoting multiculturalism in @entity1			2
he has been held in a " particularly high security " wing of @entity150 since his detention immediately after the killings			2
the prison 's governor , @entity153 , said wednesday that the institution was ready to hold @entity3 securely whether the court ruled him sane or not			1
" our job is to protect the community , " @entity153 said			0
over the past year , @entity3 has had three cells for his use , one for physical exercise and another for reading and writing , as well as a separate outdoor exercise space , he said			2
@entity3 can not mix with prisoners from other wings , but does have contact with prison staff			1
@entity1 attacks and multiculturalism " as of now , we think there is a need to subject mr. @entity3 to a particularly high security regime , " @entity153 said			2
the high security regime " puts a heavy strain on an inmate , especially if it lasts for a longer period , " he added , so @entity3 's continued detention under these conditions will be kept under constant review			2
defense lawyer @entity183 has previously said it is important to @entity3 that people see him as sane so they do n't dismiss his views			1
the court had to consider conflicting opinions from medical experts in reaching its verdict			2
an initial team of psychiatrists found @entity3 to be paranoid and schizophrenic , following 36 hours of interviews			2
however , a second pair of experts found he was not psychotic at the time of the attacks , does not suffer from a psychiatric condition and is not mentally challenged			0
their report said there is a " high risk for repeated violent actions			0
" @entity204 , a partner at law firm @entity205 , told @entity2 friday : " the general public will think only a madman can commit these offenses , but in law madness is defined very narrowly			0
basically it requires a doctor to come to court and say this person has a definable medical illness -- in this case the prosecution said he was a paranoid schizophrenic , and that can be treated with drugs and behavioral therapy			2
" if , however , he had a personality disorder or was just ... motivated , as in this case , by a misguided political belief that this was the only way to stop the @entity222 , as he would have it , of his nation , then in those circumstances he has be found guilty because he understood what he was doing was wrong			0
" disturbing look into mind of @entity1 shooter @entity3 's rampage , the worst atrocity on @entity1 soil since @entity234 , prompted much soul - searching			1
@entity1 reasserted their commitment to multiculturalism and tolerance at a series of mass public tributes held in the immediate aftermath of the massacre			0
and earlier this month , @entity1 's chief of police stepped down after an independent commission detailed a catalog of police and intelligence failures			0
it concluded that those errors cost police 30 minutes in getting to @entity13 , and that dozens of lives might have been saved			0
speaking last month on the anniversary of the killings , prime minister @entity253 urged @entity1 to " honor the dead by celebrating life , " and said @entity3 had failed in his attempt to change @entity1 's values			1
@entity2 's @entity260 and @entity261 reported from @entity0 and @entity262 from @entity263 .			0

new : @entity3 does not intend to appeal the verdict ; prosecution also wo n't appeal
the ruling that @entity3 is sane means his right - wing views can be tackled , a survivor says
" this case is going to live strongly with me for the rest of my life , " @entity57 says
@entity3 smiles as is judged to be sane and is sentenced to 21 years in prison
