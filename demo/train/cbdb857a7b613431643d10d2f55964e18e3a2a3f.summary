-- " @entity3 , " the best - reviewed new drama of the fall , premiered to solid ratings wednesday night , while the @entity6 's new action - drama " arrow " set a record for the network			1
@entity11 's country music drama delivered 9 million viewers and a 2.8 rating among adults 18 - 49			1
that 's enough to win the hour in the adult demo , topping @entity18 ' " csi " ( 10.6 million , 2.6 ) and the premiere of @entity21 's new series " @entity22 " ( 6.4 million , 1.9 )			2
but " @entity3 " was down 15 percent from the launch of " @entity24 " in this slot last year			2
@entity21 's fire - fighting drama was largely panned by critics and had a disappointing launch , down 21 percent from the debut of " @entity30 : @entity31 " in this slot last fall			1
( " @entity3 " averaged a score of 84 on @entity34 while " @entity22 " had a 49 )			2
yet here 's something interesting : of the three dramas in the hour , the @entity38 series had the weakest audience retention from its first half to its second			0
" @entity22 " did n't shed any of its demo rating between its half hours â € ” which is pretty rare for a show premiering this late at night			0
@entity3 may have a bigger rating , but " @entity22 " did a better job of keeping viewers in their seat			1
another key debut last night : the @entity6 's " arrow ' ( 4 million , 1.3 rating ) got off to a fine start			1
this may not be a huge demo rating for the network , but " arrow " marks the @entity6 's most - watched series debut in total viewers since " @entity61 " in 2009			1
the @entity6 's mission this season is to attract a broader audience than just the " @entity67 " / " 90210 " female 18 - 34 crowd , and hitting 4 million viewers certainly helps			1
the performance is also impressive considering the network 's numbers have been soft the past couple weeks			2
it 's always tougher to jump start a cold engine			0
" arrow " also gave " supernatural " ( 2.6 million , 1.0 ) a boost at 9 p.m. , spiking the veteran drama to its biggest audience in two years			1
' arrow ' debut : its aim is true @entity81 topped the night in the adult demo thanks to a steady " the x-factor " ( 9.4 million , 3.4 )			2
@entity18 was second with " @entity84 " ( 9.6 million , 2.6 ) and " @entity85 " ( 11.4 million , 3.0 )			0
@entity11 had " @entity86 " ( 7.8 million , 2.4 ) , up 9 percent , and " @entity87 " ( 6.3 million , 1.9 ) , steady			1
they were followed by a double tap of @entity89 ( 12 million , 4.7 and 12.2 million , 4.9 ) , down between 11 and 15 percent			0
' @entity90 ' : @entity91 in as ... the neighbors has clearly emerged as the weak link in the network 's wednesday comedy chain , but last night also suggested the show might be stabilizing since it did not drop this week			1
this puts @entity11 in a tough position			0
the aliens - next - door sitcom does n't have a terrible number by this fall 's standards , but you do n't want to have anything potentially dragging down your top - rated comedy , " @entity89			0
" @entity21 also had " @entity108 " ( 3.9 million , 1.1 ) , @entity109 ( 4.2 million , 1.4 ) and " svu " ( 6.2 million , 1.8 )			0
