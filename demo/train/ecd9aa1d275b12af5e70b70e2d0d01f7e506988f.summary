-- seven seasons into judging " @entity3 , " @entity1 likes to " go into it fresh every week			1
" it 's easier said than done with dozens of dance crews floating around in the former @entity9 member 's head at any given time			1
tonight 's performances of @entity13 songs will likely go a long way toward a little mental spring cleaning , though			1
after routines to @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity20 tracks , " @entity13 is a great change - up , " said @entity1			1
" the @entity20 music is very high - paced and energetic , and you 're dealing with two female icons who do dance music			2
@entity13 's tempo is totally different musically			1
that 's what i 'm looking forward to			2
it 's going to be really , really interesting to see how these crews adjust			2
" below , @entity1 talks about the latest crop of " @entity3 " competitors , teases upcoming superstars , names some of his favorite routines in the show 's history , dishes on " @entity40 " and the current boy band resurgence , and addresses rumors of an @entity9 reunion			1
" it 's a really tight race [ on ' @entity3 ' ] this year , " @entity1 admitted			1
he 's been most surprised by the @entity45			2
" on my first viewing ... i thought they were really good , but i did n't know if they possessed what it took to go all the way , " he said , " but last week 's performance really opened up my eyes			2
" he also named @entity55 and 8 @entity56 as two early standouts this season but says any of the crews " could all go all the way if they keep improving			0
" for sure , the competitors will need to keep upping the ante with the line - up of superstars to come , including @entity65 , @entity66 , and @entity67 , to name a few			2
@entity1 is especially excited for the @entity67 set because " djs are so prominent now in music			1
" he added , " it might be fun if there 's another season in front of us to do an entire week about djs			0
their music has really jumped into the forefront , and dancers react to that stuff really well			0
" outside of " @entity3 , " @entity1 admitted that he 's keeping an eye on another reality show : " @entity40			1
" he 's rooting for former fellow mousketeer and long - time friend @entity86			1
" there 's no denying that i would love to see him win , " said @entity1			1
" his voice has life in it			0
there are certain performers who sound great , but do n't have that			0
he 's been through so much that you can hear those things in his tone and with his delivery , and that 's what makes him special			0
" @entity1 is also keeping up with the current boy band revival			1
as someone who lived through the height of " @entity103 , " he is " really proud " of these guys ' success			0
" i love that @entity106 is giving young people something to get excited about , " he said			0
" look , a 10 - year - old 's not going to relate to @entity110 , so there needs to be somebody out there that can speak to somebody young to show them a good time			1
" and he definitely digs the @entity55 's " @entity118			0
" " i do n't think anybody first heard that song and said , ' that 's got to be a boy band , ' " he noted			0
" there 's room for everybody as long as it 's quality			1
" unfortunately , there 's no room for an @entity9 reunion right now			1
despite the returns of @entity129 and @entity130 in the last year , @entity1 said emphatically , " the answer 's still no. if you 're going to do something , it has to be for all the right reasons -- and that 's not money or the fact that everybody else is doing it			1
we 're happy with what it was and the way we finished things			0
we did what we set out to do and we 're comfortable with that			0
" of course , @entity1 had to pay respect the crew that took the title in season 1 : " the @entity148 were amazing			1
their imagery still stands out through 7 seasons			0
" he also gave credit to season 2â € ²s @entity155 , " really elevated the b - boy thing and brought that to the forefront in the @entity158			0
" a few more standouts : quest crew : " @entity161 " " @entity162 combined all the elements of season 1 and 2 , " said @entity1			2
" the piano routine that propelled them into the finale was very memorable			0
" @entity167 : " @entity168 " this season 5 piece stood out , too , but @entity1 admitted it was a tough call			2
" i could literally talk about at least one or two performances from each season that i liked , " he said			0
