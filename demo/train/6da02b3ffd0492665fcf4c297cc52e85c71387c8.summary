-- " @entity3 " was @entity2 's real zombie show			1
@entity4 has struck a deal with @entity6 to resurrect the rainy crime drama for a fourth season			0
that 's right : " @entity3 , " a show that 's been canceled twice , is coming back to life for a second time			1
@entity2 axed " @entity3 " after its second season last year , only to pick it up again after talks between the studio and @entity4 sparked interest in another round			1
the third season aired this summer on @entity2 to fairly modest ratings ( ending with 1.5 million viewers )			0
in september , @entity2 cancelled the increasingly ironically titled " @entity3 " â € ” again			2
but apparently those cable executives did n't execute a proper double - tap to the head			0
because @entity4 is bringing " @entity3 " back with a six - episode fourth and final season			1
stars @entity26 and @entity27 are on board , and so is showrunner @entity29			0
" the rich , serialized storytelling in ' @entity3 ' thrives on @entity4 , and we believe that it is only fitting to give @entity34 ( @entity35 ) and @entity36 ( @entity27 ) a proper send off , " said @entity30 , vice president of original content for @entity4			2
" we are looking forward to offering fans â € ” both existing and new â € ” a series that we know is perfectly suited for on - demand viewing			0
" @entity4 previously revived @entity48 's cult favorite " @entity47 " for a 4th season , and is often a company that studios call when their shows are axed to see if there 's any interest			1
the move could be a smart play for @entity4 since it gives the company an exclusive lock on the conclusion of the show without a big episode commitment ( @entity2 is not part of the deal )			1
whenever viewers stream " @entity3 " for years to come , if they want to see how the series concludes , they 'll have to watch it on @entity4 ( or a company that makes a distribution deal with @entity4 )			2
unless ... of course ... this is not really the end of " @entity3			0
" a @entity4 rep assures this order will conclude of the show , but unless the final shot of season 4 is @entity70 and @entity36 skewered on top of the @entity72 , there 's always going to be a few fans wondering if the killing could rise again , rainier and more murderous than ever			2
