@entity0 -- even as president @entity3 is expected to raise the issues of democratic rights and press freedoms during a trip to @entity8 this week , there is a question whether he will hold his own news conference with reporters covering his three - day stop in @entity0			1
@entity15 officials accompanying @entity3 cautioned leaders in @entity0 are still balking at the @entity18 proposal for a joint news conference with @entity8 president @entity20 but consultations with @entity8 officials continue on the issue , aides said			1
" no final word , " one senior administration official said			0
a separate official stressed the president may go forward with his own news conference , without @entity20 , a move that may add pressure to already tense @entity18 - @entity8 relations			1
@entity3 administration officials prepared reporters for the possibility of limited access to @entity3 during a background briefing with reporters last week			2
reservations among @entity8 officials were cited as the sole reason for potential press restrictions			2
" if you go back to when @entity8 leaders have agreed to joint press availabilities , you 'll have a very hard time finding one where they have been willing to take questions from the press , " said @entity41 analyst @entity40 at a briefing on the president 's trip last week			1
" so we want it ; they do n't			0
that 's where we end up , " @entity40 added			2
joint news conferences are a norm for @entity18 presidents as they travel much of the world			1
generally , @entity3 and foreign leaders will engage in a news conference described as " 2 +2 " with journalists , meaning two questions each from @entity18 and foreign reporters			1
but there are rare exceptions , such as @entity3 's visit to @entity72 earlier this year			1
national security advisor @entity73 raised the issue of press access with her @entity0 counterparts in the weeks leading to the president 's visit , which will include a formal bilateral meeting with @entity8 president @entity20 at a summit of @entity82 leaders			1
the president is scheduled to deliver a speech to the @entity85 gathered at the @entity82 summit monday			0
@entity3 and @entity20 will have " candid and in - depth conversations " on a range of issues , @entity87 told reporters last week			2
in addition to their meeting , both leaders will deliver statements to the media			0
but the possibility of taking questions remains the sticking point			0
press freedom and human rights in @entity8 remain a major concern for the @entity18 , @entity15 officials said			1
recent democracy protests in @entity106 have only served to elevate the issue for @entity3 , aides said			0
" we 've been very clear about our views and concerns about @entity106 and other aspects of human rights and civil liberties in @entity8 , as we have been elsewhere , " @entity87 said			0
unlike other recent trips abroad for @entity3 , he is not scheduled to meet with human rights activists or engage in other " person to person " events while in @entity8			1
he is on a tight time line , administration officials explained			0
aides said the president will hold a town hall with young @entity123 in @entity123 , during the second stop of @entity3 's three - nation tour which ends at the @entity127 summit in @entity128 later this week			1
the threat posed by @entity8 hackers to @entity18 businesses will also figure prominently in talks between the two leaders			2
" with respect to @entity8 , clearly the issues of cybersecurity will be prominent on our bilateral agenda			0
this is a source of grave concern to the @entity18 , " @entity87 said friday			0
" we have reiterated on every occasion the fact that we oppose any efforts -- official or unofficial -- to engage in cyberespionage for commercial gain or other purposes , " she added			0
@entity3 and @entity20 have fielded questions from reporters in the past , but on @entity18 soil			2
at a joint news conference in @entity152 last year , @entity20 was pressed by an @entity18 reporter on the issue of cybersecurity			1
@entity20 responded @entity8 has its own concerns with hackers			0
" @entity8 is a victim of cyber attacks , and we hope that earnest measures can be taken to resolve this matter , " @entity20 said last year .			0

@entity0 balks at proposal for joint news conference with @entity18 , @entity8 presidents
" so we want it ; they do n't . they are the host . that 's where we end up , " analyst says
@entity3 will also visit @entity123 and @entity128 during his @entity177 trip this week
