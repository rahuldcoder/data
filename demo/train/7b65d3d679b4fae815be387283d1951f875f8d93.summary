-- disgraced @entity2 owner @entity1 dug himself in even deeper during an interview with @entity0 's @entity4 on monday night			1
@entity1 purportedly went on @entity0 to apologize for his appallingly racist rant that @entity6 , an attractive young woman whom @entity1 calls a " friend , " had audiotaped and released almost two weeks earlier			1
after the team publicly protested his actions and the @entity10 fined him and banned him from basketball for life , @entity1 had a lot to apologize for , and in the interview with @entity4 , he apparently gave it his best shot			2
unfortunately for @entity1 , though , he only succeeded in confirming the worst that everyone already thought of him			1
@entity1 's " apology " was about as bad as it gets			1
although he claimed to be " so apologetic , " his expressions of regret morphed immediately into pleas for forgiveness and self - justification			1
he cited his 35 years in basketball to argue that he was entitled to " one mistake , " a blatant bid to retain ownership of the @entity2 that was apparently based on the erroneous assumption that experience trumps bigotry			1
he effectively denied responsibility for his offensive behavior by accusing @entity6 of " baiting him , " as if any provocation could justify his racist diatribe			0
for some inexplicable reason , he leveled another blistering attack at @entity38 , a beloved sports hero whose foundation has raised millions to promote hiv / aids awareness and provide mentoring and scholarships for minority students , arguing that @entity38 had n't done enough for the black community			2
astonishingly , @entity1 then blamed @entity38 's advice for his failure to come forward soon after the recordings became public			1
@entity1 is an adult , with access to clocks and calendars			2
he did n't need @entity38 to tell him that his opportunity to apologize credibly was quickly slipping away			2
although @entity1 's performance monday night was so utterly abysmal as to call his mental competence into question , the failure of his apology lies not in his delivery but in his intent			1
apologies are n't about public relations , they 're about human relations , and they 're an essential part of maintaining the mutual respect and consideration that people owe to each other no matter how much wealth or power they might have			0
an apology can succeed only if it is sincere			0
to apologize effectively , @entity1 would have to be sincerely sorry for the pain he inflicted			2
sadly , it was pretty apparent monday night that he 's not			0
no amount of self - serving blather could cover up his fundamental indifference to the feelings of those he hurt			1
for all his pratfalls monday night , @entity1 got three things right			1
opinion : the 5 apology rules that @entity1 broke first , although he did his best to backpedal , he admitted that he had said the ugly things that @entity6 caught on tape			1
that has serious implications for the @entity2 and the @entity10			2
basketball players , like other employees , are entitled to protection from illegal employment discrimination			0
@entity1 may deny being racist , but his words say otherwise , and his continued association with the team would call the intent behind every management action into question			2
the @entity2 and their fans do n't deserve to see the team mired in allegations of discrimination and threats of litigation			0
@entity1 has become a serious legal risk , and for the good of the game , he really needs to step down			0
second , @entity1 was right that a protracted lawsuit over his continued ownership of the team would benefit no one			1
litigation is rarely the best way to solve problems , and this would be an expensive , ugly fight that no one would win			0
it was heartening to hear @entity1 say that he 'll abide by whatever decision his fellow owners reach			0
one can only hope that he wo n't change his mind			0
third , and most important , @entity1 was right when he admitted that he 'd hurt a lot of people : his ex-wife , the team , the fans , the @entity10 and everyone else who believes that racism has no place in a decent society			1
what he does n't seem to understand is that the feelings of other people matter , and to deliberately injure other people by pretending that their skin color makes them " inferior " is downright shameful			0
the words hurt , and the attitude behind them hurts still more			0
@entity1 has every reason to be sorry for what he said and still sorrier for the unexamined arrogance that led him to say it			0
he owes a lot of people an apology , but until he gets his mind right , anything he says will simply do more damage			0
it 's time for @entity1 to step away from the @entity2 and spend some time examining his prejudices			1
until he 's humbled enough to apologize sincerely , though , it would be better for everyone , himself included , if he 'd just keep mum .			0

@entity151 : @entity1 's self - serving apology confirmed the worst everyone thinks of him
@entity151 : his pleas for forgiveness and self - justification were a blatant bid to keep @entity2
his excuse ? he was " baited . " she says attacking @entity38 is big mistake
@entity151 : what he got right : admitted he said ugly things , hurt people , lawsuit too *costly*
