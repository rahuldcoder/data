looking to turn a few degrees in his long - awaited " pivot to @entity3 , " president @entity0 embarks on tuesday on a four - country tour of the region in the hopes of convincing @entity9 allies the @entity10 remains focused on them			1
but like @entity0 's last attempts to renew diplomatic and economic attention on @entity3 , this trip comes amid distractions : unrest in @entity26 , recent transportation disasters at two of his stops , and wary lawmakers back home who are n't on board with @entity0 's plan to expand trade			1
the trip itself -- with stops in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33 -- is a rain - check from last october , when the @entity35 nixed a visit to @entity3 at the last minute amid the government shutdown			1
the cancellation only prompted more questions about the administration 's capacity for a foreign policy realignment that sought to counterbalance @entity44 's growing influence in @entity3			0
that repositioning first came about during @entity0 's first term , when the president and then - secretary of state @entity48 made a point of referencing a " pivot " toward relations in the @entity9 -- and implicitly , away from traditional foreign policy hotspots in the @entity53 and @entity54			1
but in the intervening years , heightened diplomacy with @entity56 , and more recently unrest in @entity26 , have grabbed far more headlines than the @entity10 ' increased efforts in @entity3			2
and a vow to allocate more military resources in the region coincided with a plan to reduce @entity64 spending substantially			0
" the region does , i think , feel like there 's a bit of distraction here in the @entity10 , " said @entity65 , a former director of @entity3 affairs in the @entity67 @entity35 who is now a senior adviser at the @entity68			2
" in polite company , people wo n't say it , but behind closed doors , i think they 'll openly ask where the pivot is -- they do n't know where it is -- or the rebalance in the second term , " @entity65 said at a briefing with reporters last week			0
" strong messaging on the @entity10 commitment to the region i think is an important way to try to compensate or try to fill that gap			0
" administration officials say @entity10 alliances in @entity3 have remained strong despite several years of flashpoints in other parts of the world			0
and they bristle at the notion the @entity35 and its diplomats can focus only on one region at a time			0
" there are often questions raised about whether or not we get distracted with @entity26 or the @entity53 , and this trip is yet one more example that we can walk and chew gum at the same time , " said @entity100 , @entity0 's senior director for @entity3 affairs			2
" there are huge parts of the government -- i 'm part of them -- that are devoted to advancing @entity10 interests in the @entity9			0
" while there are n't any major announcements expected on this week 's trip , @entity0 officials hope the visits will yield progress toward showing @entity10 's commitment to each country , and the region as a whole			1
in @entity30 , the president will look to further progress on a trade deal , though @entity127 on @entity128 have proven wary of the @entity129 , at least until november 's midterm elections			2
and in the @entity33 , a new military cooperation agreement is being negotiated that could boost @entity10 troop presence in a region where @entity44 has pushed for greater control			1
elsewhere , @entity0 's schedule is dotted with social and cultural events to highlight the region 's dynamic growth -- including an innovation center in @entity141 and a science exhibit in @entity143			0
" i think we go to the region at a time when our allies in the region are very much appreciative of and committed to our alliance relationships , " said national security adviser @entity144 during a briefing friday			0
" these alliances are only strengthening in the context of a more uncertain security environment			0
" fueling that uncertainty is the situation in @entity26 , where pro-russian forces effectively annexed the @entity159 peninsula and have moved into the eastern part of the country			0
the @entity35 has announced several rounds of sanctions against @entity165 officials and businesses , but @entity0 has been explicit that any military intervention is out of the question for the @entity10			1
that 's a cause for concern among some @entity3 allies -- including @entity30 -- who have their own territorial disputes with @entity44 , though some experts say that worry is overblown since security pacts in place would compel more robust @entity10 response in a conflict between @entity3 nations			1
" the notion that @entity30 or @entity187 or @entity10 allies in the region are nervous about the @entity10 reaction to the @entity26 and that means something for them i think is fundamentally false , " said @entity181 , who until 2011 served as senior director for @entity183 on the @entity184			1
" the @entity10 has a mutual security treaty with @entity30 for over 50 years which is @entity196 - like in its firmness , " said @entity181 , who is now a senior fellow at the @entity194			1
@entity0 's trip also comes as two of his stops contend with major transportation disasters			1
both the sinking of a ferry full of high schoolers in @entity31 and the disappearance of @entity206 have occupied those countries ' leaders in recent weeks			2
@entity209 , the deputy national security adviser , said monday it was likely @entity0 would express his support for the ferry victims ' families during his visit to @entity215			1
last week , @entity0 said the tragedy was " heartbreaking			0
" in the case of @entity32 , officials ' response to the crash has drawn wide criticism , though not from the @entity35 -- and that 's expected to remain the case through next week			2
" this trip has a very positive , affirmative agenda and that 's how we are looking at it -- as an opportunity to solidify and modernize our alliances and partnerships , " @entity144 said friday .			0
