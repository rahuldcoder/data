-- the @entity1 warned saturday that @entity3 's military claim to airspace over a disputed island chain creates the risk of " misunderstanding and miscalculation			1
" the creation of an " @entity10 " by @entity3 , which its top defense official described as an early - warning system , comes amid rising tensions between @entity3 and @entity14 over claims to the islands that are believed to have large oil reserves			1
" this unilateral action constitutes an attempt to change the status quo in the @entity21			1
@entity24 action will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident , " @entity1 secretary of state @entity22 said			2
" ... we have urged @entity3 to exercise caution and restraint , and we are consulting with @entity14 and other affected parties throughout the region			1
" the dispute over the islands -- known as the @entity36 by @entity14 and the @entity36 by @entity3 -- has strained relations between the two countries			1
the islands are close to strategically important shipping lanes and their legal owners would also have the right to the rich marine life in surrounding waters			0
even as @entity3 's @entity46 said the new air defense zone was not directed toward a specific country , it released a map and coordinates that shows the zone covers most of @entity21 , as well as the islands			1
" this is a necessary measure taken by @entity3 in exercising its self - defense right , " col. @entity53 said in remarks posted on the ministry website			2
" it is not directed against any specific country or target			0
it does not affect the freedom of over-flight in the related airspace			0
" the @entity3 defense ministry also said it began patrols of the zone on saturday			1
@entity14 's defense ministry said two @entity3 planes came within miles of its airspace , prompting authorities to scramble @entity14 fighter jets			1
it 's the second time this month that @entity14 has launched fighter jets , alleging @entity3 planes appeared to be closing in on its air space			1
@entity1 secretary of defense @entity77 called the move by @entity3 an attempt to destabilize the status quo in the region , and it " increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations			1
" " this announcement by the @entity3 will not in any way change how the @entity1 conducts military operations in the region , " @entity86 said			2
the disagreement over who owns the islands flared between the two countries in the latter half of 2012			0
protests erupted in @entity3 after @entity14 announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private @entity14 owners			1
the deal was struck in part to prevent the islands from being bought by @entity103 governor @entity102 , who had called for donations for a public fund to buy them			0
@entity3 was outraged , as were protesters who marched through several @entity3 cities calling for boycotts of @entity14 products and urging the government to give the islands back			1
in december 2012 , the dispute escalated when @entity14 scrambled fighter jets after a @entity3 plane was seen near the islands			2
a number of @entity3 ships also have entered contested waters despite warnings from the @entity121			0
@entity3 says its claim extends back hundreds of years			0
@entity14 says it saw no trace of @entity3 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity14 sovereign territory in 1895			2
@entity14 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers			2
the @entity14 surrender at the end of @entity134 in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further			0
the islands were administered by the @entity1 occupation force after the war			0
but in 1972 , @entity139 returned them to @entity14 as part of its withdrawal from @entity143			0
@entity144 , which @entity145 regards as a breakaway province , also lays claim to the islands			0
@entity0 's @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
