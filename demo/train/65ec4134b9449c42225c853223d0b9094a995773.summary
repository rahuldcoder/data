@entity1 , @entity0 -- an $ 80 million research project aimed at giving people 50 active years after the age of 50 was launched by scientists at the @entity7 in northern @entity0 tuesday			1
the challenge is to ensure old people stay as fit as @entity11 centenarian @entity10 , seen competing at shot put during @entity13 in @entity14 this month			2
about half of the babies born in @entity18 countries today will live until they are 100 years old , according to recent research published in the medical journal @entity21 , so the challenge is to ensure they remain active throughout their old age			1
while most of us will live longer than our parents and grandparents , the aging population means that in coming decades more people will suffer from age - related conditions such as osteoarthritis , heart disease and chronic back pain			1
obesity and increased physical activity also put more pressure on our joints , causing them to wear out faster			2
scientists at @entity7 envisage that many of the body parts that flounder with age could be upgraded using own - grown tissues and more durable implants			1
this will mean artificial hips , knees and heart valves , for example , lasting far longer than the current 20 - year typical lifespan			0
" our work is driven by the concept of 50 more years after 50 -- that is , making our second 50 years of life as healthy , comfortable and active as our first , so we can enjoy a higher quality of life , " explains professor @entity51 , who is an expert in artificial joints and tissue regeneration			1
" we now have the technology available to do astonishing things , such as repairing the body by growing healthy new tissue through biological scaffolds and stem cell therapy			2
and a new generation of prosthetic hip and knee joints that last longer will avoid the need for further replacements			0
" @entity51 says the center also hopes to gain a better understanding of degenerative diseases to allow for early diagnosis , rather than having to treat someone when they are already in crippling pain			0
" for example , we 're developing biosensor tools that can detect the presence of antibodies and proteins in the blood			0
all of these technologies will ultimately reduce suffering in patients through more timely interventions , shorter hospital stays and quicker recovery times			0
" so how do you feel about this			0
are you looking forward to your old age ? do you believe you will remain active ? click here to send us your comments and we will try to use as many as possible in tonight 's show .			1
