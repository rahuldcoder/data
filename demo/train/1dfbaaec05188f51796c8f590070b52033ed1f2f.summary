-- we are now able to project a winner in the 2012 presidential race : @entity4			1
if that was n't clear enough already , it became abundantly so at the end of @entity9 's victory speech in @entity10 last weekend			2
as @entity12 left the stage , his campaign staff played a song through the speaker system			1
the song was " only in @entity19 , " by the country duo @entity4			1
that song has become a bipartisan standard in recent presidential campaigns			1
@entity23 and @entity24 used it at their rallies ; @entity28 used it at his rallies ; @entity31 used it at his rallies ; and now @entity12 is using it			1
politicians have long utilized campaign songs , but it is unusual for @entity38 and @entity39 to share the same song			1
after @entity41 used @entity47 's " @entity45 ) " in his 1992 campaign , it would have been inconceivable for a @entity38 opponent to use it at @entity38 rallies that year , or for @entity38 four years later to use it			1
it would have reminded potential voters of the other guy			0
but " @entity59 " has managed to transcend party lines ; its lyrics , about the @entity19 ideal of opportunity for all , seem to speak to a deeply held national belief , even a yearning , and the insistent opening guitar chords rivet an audience			1
" only in @entity19 , " @entity61 's voice sings , " dreaming in red , white and blue ; only in @entity19 , where we dream as big as we want to			0
... " when @entity28 , late in the summer of 2008 , finished his speech accepting his party 's nomination for president in that packed @entity71 football stadium in @entity72 , there was the @entity4 song booming out of the speakers , becoming the soundtrack of the historic moment			1
that four years earlier the song had been playing at @entity23 / @entity24 events did n't seem to matter			1
" we all get a chance , everybody gets to dance			0
... " @entity4 , after a 20 - year career of platinum albums and no. 1 hits , have broken up and no longer perform together			1
but last week i was able to get in touch with both @entity86 and @entity61 , and in separate conversations we talked about what having their song become the go - to anthem for presidential candidates means			2
" the song was never intended to be partisan , and it is n't , " said @entity61			2
he was in rehearsals for a solo tour in support of his new single , " @entity101 , " and even though the @entity4 duo is no more , he said he often thinks about the political life that song of theirs has taken on			1
" it 's about the opportunity , in @entity19 , to try to attain anything you want , " he said			0
when , in 2008 , the song began to be heard at rallies for both sides ( neither candidate had asked for their permission ) , he and @entity86 made the decision not to say anything publicly about their private political preferences : " we kind of laid low			2
we did that on purpose			0
" which made all kinds of sense			0
some singers and bands , when their songs are played by candidates they do n't favor , loudly demand that the candidate stop immediately			0
@entity61 and his partner instinctively realized that if both parties had adopted " only in @entity19 , " they should just sit back and let their work be constantly heard by citizens of every political persuasion			0
when good fortune unexpectedly comes raining down on you , the last thing you want to do is reach for an umbrella			0
" i 'm moved by the whole thing , " @entity61 said			0
" of all the voices in @entity19 , to have my voice be the one that sings those words			0
. " @entity86 , who is completing his own solo album and also hosts the syndicated radio show " @entity143 , " told me , " the song was never @entity38 or @entity146			1
i think that politicians of both parties get that			0
" @entity86 wrote the song , in collaboration with @entity153 songwriters @entity152 and @entity154 , as simply " an appreciation of our freedoms in @entity19			2
" when @entity4 were filling arenas and stadiums night after night , there would come a moment , midway through " only in @entity19 , " when local members of the military invited by the band -- usually four or five of them , from the different branches , always in uniform -- would march in crisp formation onto the stage , and would face the audience , then salute			2
the audiences would stand and cheer , some people with tears flowing			0
it might be the one and only time in the lives of the young men and women from the @entity176 , the @entity177 , the @entity178 and the @entity179 when they would have a moment like this : when they would be onstage in front of tens of thousand of people , and be applauded with gratitude for the sacrifice they were making			0
" after the song , " @entity86 said , " the soldiers would leave the stage , and i would look at them , and they would just be glowing			2
" campaign songs have always been a tradition with presidential candidates -- " marching with @entity194 " for @entity194 , " he 's @entity195 " for @entity196 , " @entity197 with @entity198 " for @entity198 , " @entity199 and keep @entity200 " for @entity200 -- but only in recent years have songs that are already big hits , and that were not written for a candidate , been made a regular part of campaign playlists			1
with the @entity4 song , neither political party seems to want to be the one not to play it			1
it has , without any push from the men who sang it , managed to become a part of the presidential process			1
" if the candidates want our song to come out of their speakers , it 's fine with me , " said @entity86 , who was born in @entity215 , @entity216 , during @entity218 's first term			2
" i just feel lucky			0
i never got tired of singing it " said @entity61 , who was born in @entity224 , @entity225 , also while @entity218 was in the @entity226			0
