-- a suicide bomber walks into a bar			1
he shouts at the bartender , " gim me the money , or i blow this place to bits ! " the worried bartender hands him a wad of cash , and the bomber departs			2
the next day , the suicide bomber returns to the same bar			1
he shouts at the bartender , " gim me the money , or i blow this place to bits ! " " are you nuts ? " answers the bartender			0
" if i give you money every day , i 'll go out of business			0
plus , you 're scaring away the customers			0
" " i tell you what , " replies the bomber , " gim me the money , and i wo n't come back until the day after tomorrow			2
" welcome to the art of negotiation , @entity29 style			2
since the election of 2010 , the @entity30 has narrowly averted three @entity29 - built suicide bombs : one government shutdown , one debt default and one fiscal cliff			1
we have two more scheduled for february : across - the - board spending cuts and another debt ceiling expiration			0
the @entity40 ' suicide strategy is a relatively new addition to @entity30 politics			2
@entity43 pioneered the first government shutdown in 1995			2
it was so disastrous that no one tried it again for 16 years			0
in the meantime , @entity29 pursued a more traditional method known as the democratic process			2
they campaigned for election and took control of the @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
from 2001 to 2006 , the dominant @entity29 passed plenty of conservative legislation			2
( they did not , however , reduce spending or balance the budget			0
) @entity60 : fiscal cliff was bound to collapse when their golden era came to an end , many @entity29 refused to accept that the popular will had turned against them and resorted to obstructionist tactics			1
in the @entity54 , they have filibustered 391 @entity67 bills in the past six years , culminating last month in minority leader @entity69 's historic filibuster of his own bill			1
the democrats are no strangers to the filibuster , of course , but they managed only 201 in their six years of minority status			0
yet the @entity54 is a model of effective government compared with the @entity55 , now the only @entity29 - dominated branch of the federal government			1
frustrated by their inability to get conservative legislation past the @entity67 - controlled @entity54 and @entity53 , congressional @entity29 have revived the " suicide bomb			1
" the key to the suicide bomb strategy is to convince people that members of the conservative wing of the @entity29 are crazy enough to wreck the economy if they do n't get their way			1
@entity67 leaders seem to believe them			2
like the hapless bartender , they keep tossing the @entity29 wads of cash -- spending cuts and tax breaks -- in order to spare the country from a debt default , shutdown or recession			1
opinion : @entity29 civil war over @entity105 disaster relief but this bomber will not be satisfied by a few payoffs			1
the @entity40 continue to use every opportunity to extract concessions by threatening to wreck the economy ... again			0
when treasury secretary @entity112 proposed a permanent debt ceiling extension during the last round of negotiations , @entity111 reportedly laughed in his face			1
the suicide bomb has become the @entity40 ' most effective weapon			0
why would they give that up ? president @entity121 was slow to see the pattern , but after three nail - biting suicide negotiations in two years , he seems to have finally realized that he can not continue to encourage the bomb threats with concessions			1
as attention turned to the next debt ceiling battle , he declared , " while i will negotiate over many things , i will not have another debate with this @entity127 over whether or not they should pay the bills that they 've already racked up through the laws that they passed			0
" hopefully , he will maintain this resolve			0
the endless threats not only enable republicans to subvert the democratic process , they hurt the country			0
even if the @entity40 never actually fulfill their ultimatums , the anxiety provoked by such threats damages the economy by creating uncertain business conditions			0
to extend the metaphor : the suicide bomber is scaring away the customers			1
so what will happen when @entity121 finally says enough is enough ? is the country destined to go @entity153 ? @entity154 : @entity155 drops bomb on @entity29 leaders fortunately not			1
the joke has a hidden punchline			0
it turns out that the suicide bomber is a part - owner of the bar			1
the folks who will lose the most if the bomb goes off are the investors , bankers and businesspeople who still retain large stakes in the @entity29			0
when the @entity29 threatened to let the government default in 2011 , the @entity30 @entity168 and other industry advocates objected with growing concern			1
if the @entity67 refuse to negotiate this time around , industry advocates will not sit idly while the party they finance deliberately ruins their businesses			0
but what if the conservative @entity29 are really that crazy ? what if they are so committed to their agenda and dismissive of their constituents that they will allow unemployment to rise , interest rates to skyrocket , government services to disappear , seniors to lose their @entity185 checks and other catastrophic consequences of debt defaults and government shutdowns ? if that is the case , however unlikely , than we will only have to survive until the next election , at which point the @entity40 will discover that suicide bombings produce only one guaranteed casualty : the bomber himself			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity199 : @entity29 " negotiations " on cliff , debt are like a suicide bomber 's
he says threat to shut down government , hurt economy pioneered by @entity210
he says strategy back again ; @entity67 cave in the face of it . @entity121 may be *wising* up
@entity199 : for threat to work , suicide bombers must blow themselves up . @entity29 *beware*
