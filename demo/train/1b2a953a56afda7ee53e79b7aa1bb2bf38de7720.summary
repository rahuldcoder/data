-- " there is a sense that he is ' one of us , ' a true fan of comics			1
" that 's how @entity8 , co-host of the @entity10 podcast , describes @entity11 , the chief creative officer at @entity12 and one of the most influential figures in comics today			1
all those trailers you 've been seeing for the upcoming " @entity19 " movie ? a good chunk of the credit should go to @entity11			1
he 's a co-producer on the film , but he 's also responsible for giving the character top billing recently in comics and , ultimately , in pop culture			2
@entity11 brought @entity27 back to life in the " @entity19 : rebirth " series and went on to cast the emerald warrior 's world as the focal point of the @entity33 in the popular " @entity35 " comic event			1
now , he 's taking on @entity12 's newest large - scale series : " flashpoint , " a world in which everything you know will change in a flash			2
the first issue hits shelves wednesday			2
" i did n't want to take the @entity33 , put it in a box , shake the box and pour it out , " @entity11 said			1
" i wanted to take the major characters and show what they could be like if they were put on a different path			2
" the one constant is another fan favorite that owes his recent reincarnation to @entity58 , @entity59			0
some flash facts about the scarlet speedster : @entity59 is a police scientist who , thanks to an accident , was imbued with the @entity65 , an energy that turned him into the fastest man alive			0
he sacrificed his life during one of @entity12 's first mega events , " @entity72 , " back in the 1980s , but returned in recent years as a regular fixture in the @entity12 world			0
taking decades of mythology in new directions might seem like a daunting task			0
but @entity76 , @entity8 's co-host on the @entity10 podcast , said it 's a balancing act that @entity11 performs well			1
" he can retool a character or his / her history to make it more relevant to current readers without throwing away or disrespecting the work of previous creators			2
" if you 're not familiar with @entity59 's back story , @entity11 said , you do n't need to worry about playing catch - up before diving into the new series			1
" you get all you need to know about @entity90 in ' @entity91 , ' and then you 're exploring a whole new universe together			0
so you 're seeing it through @entity58 's eyes for the very first time			2
" a fan 's writer based on his track record , there 's a good chance fans will be happy with the journey @entity11 is taking them on			1
" @entity11 seems to be widely respected in the fan community , both as a writer and as a person , " @entity8 said			1
" i think the fact that he delivers great stories on a routine basis has earned him a lot of goodwill			0
" @entity11 has a lot in common with those fans , since his early experiences with comics mirrored many of their own			1
he started reading in the 1980s , gravitating toward the big , colorful characters of the @entity33			0
but in a world often dominated by @entity120 -- @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 -- it was the flash that grabbed @entity11 ' attention			1
" i thought his costume was amazing			0
i thought superspeed was really fascinating			0
i thought he had the greatest rogues ' gallery , " @entity11 said			1
" @entity90 felt like a doorway to all these wonderful things			0
" an epic tale the doorway he 's taking readers through with " flashpoint " is one that opens on more than one character			0
" @entity90 is about speed and time and altering perceptions			1
i wanted to explore that on a dc - wide scale , " @entity11 said			1
doing things on a wide scale can present challenges for readers			0
@entity145 , manager at @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity148 , said some customers grow frustrated about having to spend too much money on large crossover titles			0
" flashpoint " has a five - issue main story , with more than a dozen planned miniseries and a handful of one - shot stories			1
podcast hosts @entity76 and @entity8 think the sheer volume may overwhelm some fans			0
" that 's a lot to digest and lot of money to commit , " @entity76 said			0
@entity11 acknowledged the concerns but said the side miniseries are meant to be complementary , not obligatory			1
" if you 're interested , you can check out the other miniseries , but they 're not vital to the main story			0
they expand and flesh out the world behind ' flashpoint , ' but you really only need to invest in the five main issues			0
" can @entity90 follow @entity19 and jump to the forefront of pop culture ? a big - screen adaptation is being developed , and @entity8 and @entity76 both feel that the character is popular enough for the " flashpoint " series to do well			2
@entity11 said his ultimate goal is to increase that popularity			2
" i wanted to create a book that would intrigue people enough to give @entity90 a shot , " @entity11 said			1
" my hope is that anyone who 's not a @entity90 fan , by the end of issue five , will be a @entity90 fan , whether they 're a current reader , lapsed reader or new reader			0

@entity11 is one of the most influential figures in comics today
fans feel a *connection* to his work : " there is a sense that he is ' one of us ' "
@entity11 is writing " flashpoint , " a new miniseries that *launches* wednesday
@entity11 : i wanted to explore " speed and time and altering perceptions "
