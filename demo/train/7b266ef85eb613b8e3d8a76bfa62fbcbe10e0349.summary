-- a @entity3 @entity2 ruling on friday will enable a religious - affiliated non-profit and other groups like it to remain temporarily exempt from @entity7 requirements for covering birth control and other reproductive health they oppose on moral grounds			1
the justices extended an injunction first granted on an emergency basis just before the @entity15 for a @entity17 charity for the elderly run by nuns , the @entity20			1
the high court order , which also covers the charity 's insurance administrator , will remain in effect while lower courts continue to wrangle with the merits of the primary challenge to the federal health law mandates on contraception			1
although temporary , it is an important victory for those objecting to the socially charged requirements under the @entity7 that were a negotiated compromise aimed at allowing coverage but also allowing a workaround for those opposing it			2
in a once - sentence order without any noted dissent , the @entity2 said the @entity41 administration could not enforce the mandates if those involved tell the @entity44 in writing that they are a non-profit and hold themselves " out as religious and have religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services			1
" although the high court order applies specifically to the @entity20 and its administrator , @entity51 , it will likely have the practical effect of keeping the government from forcing other religious non-profits that raised similar objections to comply with the mandates			1
for instance , @entity51 , an @entity57 - based non-profit , handles insurance policies for a number of religious - affiliated organizations			0
a sticking point the contraception issue has been a major sticking point in the health law , president @entity41 's signature diplomatic achievement that overall has been the subject of enormous legal and political controversy			1
the requirements in question that took effect january 1 were designed by the administration to give women employed at nonprofit , religious - based organizations -- such as certain hospitals and private faith - based universities -- the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies with no co-pay			1
the central dispute revolves around a negotiated requirement for those religious - affiliated groups not wanting to comply to sign a form explaining their objections			0
so - called self - certification would permit third - party administrators to provide the coverage			0
churches and houses of worships are exempt from the requirement outright			0
religious - based groups sought delays , saying that signing the form would force them " to choose between onerous penalties or becoming complicit in a grave moral wrong			2
" but the justices in their unsigned order concluded that to " meet the condition for injunction pending appeal , applicants need not use the form prescribed by the government and need not send copies to third - party administrators			2
" varied reaction a @entity110 spokesman said in a statement that the ruling was narrowly applied to the plaintiffs and " is not a ruling on the merits " of the charity 's larger legal appeal			1
the statement also said the @entity20 and @entity51 have " always been eligible for an accommodation from the contraceptive coverage requirement			0
" the @entity121 had said previously the birth control requirement was lawful and " essential to a woman 's health " and that its rules struck the right balance			2
others talked past each other in reacting to the decision			2
" we are delighted that the @entity2 has issued this order protecting the @entity135 , " said @entity130 , senior counsel for the @entity131 , the group representing the nuns in court			1
" the government has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people			0
it does n't need to force nuns to participate			0
" but @entity143 , president , @entity144 , agreed with the @entity110 in that the decision was " narrow and specific " and centered around an administrative mechanism for claiming exemption			1
" this is a case about paperwork , not religious liberty , " @entity143 said in a statement			0
back to the appeals court the issue now goes back to the 10th @entity154 in @entity155 , which will hold oral arguments in coming weeks			0
a ruling by mid-year could then prompt a final , eventual high court review			0
recognizing that , the @entity2 made clear it has not decided the larger legal and constitutional issues at stake , merely acted on the enforcement question			1
" the court issues this order based on all of the circumstances of the case , and this order should not be construed as an expression of the court 's views on the merits , " the justices said			2
in march , they will take up a related challenge to the birth control mandate when the court hears arguments over whether some for - profit corporations should be exempt , again on religious liberty grounds			0
key requirements of the @entity7 are just now kicking into gear following years of fierce political and other turmoil that included a @entity2 ruling that found it constitutional , and a flawed rollout of its online enrollment process this past fall			1
the case is @entity20 v. @entity188 ( 13a691 )			0
@entity0 's @entity189 and @entity190 contributed to this report .			0

charity run by nuns sought exemption from health law contraception mandates
@entity2 preserves exemption while issue is handled by lower courts
the decision will have a *broader* impact on enforcement of requirements
new : *lawyers* for charity praise @entity2 decision ; @entity144 says it 's a narrow order
