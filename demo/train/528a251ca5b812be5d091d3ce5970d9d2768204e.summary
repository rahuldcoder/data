@entity0 -- thousands of photos taken during @entity3 's 1,036 days as president remain unseen since @entity6 photographer @entity5 printed and logged them in his darkroom five decades ago			1
when @entity5 's family auctioned them last month , collector and filmmaker @entity9 purchased about 15,000 of the images , including many showing private @entity3 family moments			1
" he was there all the time , and he trusted him with his life , " @entity9 said of @entity5			1
most captured public events , but usually just a few shots from an event would have been released , @entity9 said			0
the boxes likely hold surprises , but it could take years for him to examine each image , he said			0
" i would say 95 % of these photos have never been published or seen by anyone , and that is because there are just way too many , " @entity9 said			2
@entity9 gave @entity1 the first peek inside the boxes after the photographs were delivered to him in @entity0 this week			1
reaching into a box and pulling out a stack of photos is like traveling through time , he said			0
he pulled out a stack of 5 - by - 5 black - and - white photos , some stuck together by the years			0
they appeared to be in the same sequence in which @entity5 developed them in his @entity6 darkroom			1
this first stack showed @entity45 's fifth birthday party , her last with her father			0
president @entity3 was assassinated five days before her sixth			0
another batch revealed a 2 - year - old @entity49 -- known then as @entity50 -- reaching into his parakeet 's cage while his mother held him			0
it was the younger @entity49 who first stirred @entity9 's interest in @entity57 's photo archives in 1997			2
@entity3 was his friend and a client of his @entity60 gallery , he said			0
" he called me one night and said ' i need this photo , you know , the photo of me under the desk , but not the famous one , ' " @entity9 said			0
the " famous one " of a young @entity3 under the @entity68 desk while his father worked above him was taken by photographer @entity65 for @entity66 in october 1963			2
but @entity3 wanted a photo taken a year earlier by @entity5 , he said			1
@entity9 found a surprise this weekend preparing for an interview with @entity1 's @entity73			1
it was an unknown photo of @entity45 playing with another girl in the same spot under her father 's desk			0
@entity9 did not immediately know if the other girl was a @entity3 cousin or a friend			2
@entity3 cousins may recognize themselves in photos they had long forgotten or have never seen			2
" it 's impossible for anyone to have seen these because @entity5 was so secretive , " @entity9 said			1
" he was so protective and he had all these items locked up			0
" @entity9 bought several hundred photos from @entity57 in the last years of his life , including the one that is apparently the only existing photo of @entity3 with @entity90			1
" @entity5 was with president @entity3 basically all the time and even in some fairly intimate moments , " @entity9 said			1
" it is shocking at the incredible volume of photos that he took , including some that are highly sensitive and private			0
" since @entity9 is busy writing a book and producing a documentary about @entity90 's mysterious death , combing through his newly - acquired @entity3 collection will be slow , he said			1
he will start posting the first of the @entity3 images on his website @entity105 for licensing , he said			2
@entity9 also claims the largest collection of @entity109 photos , but the numbers are minuscule compared to @entity3 's			1
only 129 unique images of @entity109 are known to exist , he said .			0

most of the 15,000 images of @entity3 and family are *unpublished*
@entity6 photographer @entity5 kept most of his prints private
@entity5 's family sold the *massive* collection to @entity9 in a *december* auction
@entity9 gave @entity1 the first peek inside the boxes of @entity3 photos
