the shootings at the nation 's largest army post , in central @entity1 between @entity110 and @entity111 , shocked the nation and raised questions about whether a so - called homegrown terrorist had operated within the military system without detection			0
the @entity118 hearing is not expected to provide answers to why @entity5 , who had communicated with a known @entity121 extremist and made anti- @entity90 comments , was promoted nonetheless			1
