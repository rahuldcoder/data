-- two decades ago , the @entity1 was signed into law , becoming a hallmark of @entity5 civil rights legislation			1
the act forbids discrimination against individuals with disabilities in a range of areas like employment , access to public facilities , transportation and telecommunications			2
over the last 20 years , sidewalk ramps have been installed and accessibility to most public places has been improved			0
yet , vehicles largely have been ignored			0
but that 's about to change			0
@entity21 , a @entity22 , @entity23 - based company plans to start production of the @entity21 , which stands for first mobility vehicle , at a plant in @entity27 , @entity28 , late this year			1
" this is the first vehicle that 's been built from the ground up for wheelchair accessibility and the only vehicle that 's factory - produced that meets the requirements of the @entity5 with @entity1 , " according to @entity36 , the ceo for @entity21			1
@entity36 said there are 54 million @entity5 who have some kind of of disability , with 4 million of them being wheelchair dependent			2
those needing wheelchair accessibility typically have to convert a new or used vehicle , including the addition of a ramp , which @entity36 says compromises vehicle 's structural integrity			2
that , he said , negates the safety ratings of the vehicle and negates the factory warranty as it pertains to those modifications			2
" our vehicle , you drive up the ramp , and you turn right and immediately you 're sitting in the prime seat of the vehicle which is shotgun next to the driver , " @entity36 said			0
during a test drive , @entity36 said he took a friend of his , who is a member of the @entity63 wheelchair basketball team , out to lunch			0
" he 's sitting there having a sandwich and his coke and he says ' i 'm sitting in the front seat using a cup holder looking out the front window of this car			0
and i ca n't even remember the last time i did that , ' " @entity36 said			0
smaller than your typical passenger van converted to handle wheelchairs , the @entity21 will be rated as a car , standing about five - feet tall			1
the 36 - inch door opening and access ramp complies with the @entity1 , while fitting nearly every size wheelchair			1
@entity36 said he expects the @entity21 - 1 to start below $ 40,000 , noting the company has received 4,000 reservations .			1

the new vehicle is made for wheelchair - bound passengers
the @entity21 is made " from the ground up " for *people* with disabilities
the @entity1 was passed in 1990
