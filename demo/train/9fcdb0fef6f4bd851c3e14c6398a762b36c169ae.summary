an 11 - year - old boy 's rendition of the national anthem at @entity3 of the @entity5 finals brought the usual appreciative applause tuesday , but outside @entity8 in @entity9 , his performance brought a darker reaction from some posters on social media -- and eventually an online backlash against their racist comments			1
see the performance by @entity17 here 's a sampling of some of the unkind tweets that went flying around the internet about @entity22 : -- " why they got a @entity25 kid singing the national anthem - _ _ _ - " from @entity27			1
-- " how you singing the national anthem looking like an illegal immigrant " from @entity31 , proud father and firefighter from @entity33 , @entity34			1
-- " @entity35 is a foreigner singing the national anthem			1
i realize that 's @entity9 but that still ai n't @entity40 " from @entity41			2
-- " who let this illegal alien sing our national anthem ? " from @entity46			1
and the list went on and on			0
as for @entity22 , he said the racist comments have not fazed him			1
" for those that said something bad about me , i understand it 's your opinion , " said @entity22 to @entity50			2
" i 'm a proud @entity56 and live in a free country			1
it 's not hurting me			2
it 's just your opinion			0
" @entity22 has been singing since he was 5 but gained fame in 2012 after being on @entity62 's " @entity61 " for singing his mariachi ballads with hopes of winning to help his younger brother get surgery for his hearing problem			2
@entity68 , @entity22 's father , has n't taken the negative comments personally at all			1
" when he was on ' @entity61 , ' he faced racism there , too			0
you ca n't satisfy everyone , " said @entity72 to @entity50			1
" i think people reacted the way they did because @entity22 was wearing his mariachi outfit , " said @entity72 , " but , it does n't make sense to listen to those people when most of the feedback we have gotten is positive			2
" a collection of the negative tweets was posted on @entity87 , a @entity89 blog dedicated to outing and shaming racists ' social media posts			0
other media outlets used that post as the foundation for the story , and the story took off from there			0
the blog highlighted 28 tweets from @entity5 fans who came off as offended and ashamed that the @entity102 would allow the boy , who happened to have been born and raised in @entity9 , to sing the nation 's anthem			1
however , @entity87 must have suspected what would happen once the racist tweets were posted because most of the @entity109 handles have been deactivated or the tweet has been removed			2
the blog posted screen shots of the tweets so it could continue to display the public microbloggers ' rants			0
after the harsh reaction spread across the @entity118 , tweets supporting and defending @entity22 and vociferously denouncing his critics started to take over : -- " that little 10 year old mariachi @entity120 singer has more talent and grace than the combined racist pig idiots on @entity109 , " from @entity25 - @entity56 cartoonist @entity125 -- " racist scumbag says chicano kid singing nat'l anthem just " snuck into the country			1
" this idiot 's apparently of color too			0
@ @entity132 , " from @entity133 , a @entity134 board member and middle school teacher			0
-- " why are ppl so upset over a @entity137 singing the national anthem			1
he 's probably got more roots in here than most ' @entity56 ' , " said @entity139 on @entity109			1
-- and , from the @entity147 , " we 're proud of the 11 - year old @entity145 - native @entity22 for his amazing performance last night ! " @entity9 is a multicultural city with more than 55 % of the population being @entity137 and 90 % of those people identifying themselves as @entity25 according to the @entity150			1
for some @entity25 , the incident was just the latest sign of a persistent problem they face : being treated as outsiders in their own country			2
" to see people acting this way does n't make sense anymore			0
it 's a demographic fact that the country is changing and @entity164 are going to be behind that economic push that moves everyone forward , " said @entity160 , director of the @entity161 , to @entity50			0
" cities like @entity9 are defining a trend of a nation			0
" that the word " @entity25 " is being used as a derogatory term is part of the problem , said @entity160 , " it 's become the n - word of @entity25 descent			1
yet it 's also the name of a group of people in a neighboring country			0
" it will take a lot more than some racist tweets to bring @entity22 down			0
the " boy with the golden voice " tweeted earlier today : " please do not pay attention to the negative people			0
i am an @entity56 living the @entity188			0
this is part of the @entity56 life			0
" @entity22 said today was like any other day , but he 's always grateful to wake up to yet another day able to sing			2
he said he owes his positive outlook to his parents , family and everyone in @entity9			0
see how @entity22 is handling the reaction follow @entity196 on @entity109			1
