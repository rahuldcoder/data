president @entity0 , who will act on immigration reform by the end of the year , and his administration have not finalized plans on the issue , but he 's aware of the general details in the expected plan , according to sources in the government and elsewhere who have been briefed on the @entity11 plans			1
at the end of the day it will all come down to what the legal team thinks can be defended in court , in addition to some political considerations , sources say			2
" it 's not like this is the @entity26 , " one official told @entity21 recently , meaning that the contents of the envelope are not a surprise			2
citing his legal authority as chief executive of the @entity29 , @entity0 said in a press conference in @entity31 friday that he would act on immigration reform by the end of the year			1
" i believe that @entity29 is a nation of immigrants , " the president said			2
everybody agrees that the system is broken ; there has been ample opportunity for @entity39 to pass a bipartisan immigration bill that would strengthen our borders , improve the legal immigration system and lift millions of people out of the shadows so that they are paying taxes and getting right by the law			2
" the senior @entity11 official who spoke to @entity21 said that any executive action could come as soon as this week			1
the @entity11 is also not going to yield to threats of a shutdown			1
asked tuesday about a potential scenario in which @entity54 would try to defund @entity0 's immigration action in an upcoming spending bill			1
@entity11 spokesman @entity57 said wednesday that the president 's actions would be within the law			1
" we would consider it to be unwarranted for @entity68 in @entity39 to try to undo that executive action using the budget process , " @entity57 told reporters , casting doubt that such an a move would " determine the outcome at all " of @entity0 's actions			1
warnings from @entity68 are not affecting @entity11 plans , according to the official , who said the @entity11 is not going to command less in the executive action order just to appease furious lawmakers			1
@entity0 friday encouraged @entity39 to act on immigration and said he told @entity68 congressional leaders that he was interested in working on a legislative solution , but without that he would act			1
" i indicated to ( @entity11 ) speaker ( @entity80 ) @entity79 several months ago that if in fact @entity39 failed to act i would use all the lawful authority that i possess to try and make the system work better			1
and that 's gon na happen , that 's gon na happen before the end of the year , " said @entity0			1
the senior @entity11 official said that before issuing any order the president will review his administration 's proposals for extending deportation relief to undocumented immigrants with @entity29 - born children and those who entered the @entity29 as children themselves			1
another senior administration official told @entity21 that the main contours of the executive action are three-fold : direct immigration agents to allow parents of children who are @entity29 citizens to obtain documents that allows them to stay in the @entity29 legally , protect illegal immigrants who came to the @entity29 as children and make clear deportation should still be the policy for convicted criminals			1
the plans appear to exclude any parents of " dreamers , " those who were brought in illegally as children who already have deferred action themselves from @entity0 's earlier action , according to sources			1
though the general details of the plan are known , it is still in flux , and may change by the time it is announced , according to two other sources briefed on the subject who shared more in - depth details under consideration with @entity21			1
those sources said that the plan includes a focus on deporting criminal illegal immigrants			2
the final number of immigrants shielded will be affected by restrictions such as whether people with police infractions such as a @entity133 can qualify , they said			2
the plan would include an expansion of visas in certain categories of workers such as those in the technology industry , which is popular with the business community , and more resources to protect the border , according to the sources			1
the move has been the subject of months of anticipation			0
but with lame duck legislative wrangling underway on @entity152 , the president 's advisers could also wait until next month to make a final decision on how to repair a system both @entity68 and @entity155 admit needs fixing			1
and while officials say the specifics of what he will announce have n't been finalized , the broad outlines of a potential plan that eases deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants have been floated by immigration groups for months			1
for the multitude of groups who are watching the process unfold , the moment is charged			0
" without hesitation i can say the level of anticipation is intense			0
we were hoping this would happen in september , " said @entity175 , deputy vice president of the @entity176			2
" it 's long overdue			0
" millions affected an expansion of @entity0 's " deferred action " program ( @entity182 ) that went into place in the summer of 2012 is considered to be a likely component of @entity0 's immigration action , according to two sources close to the plan who spoke to @entity21			1
@entity182 delayed deportation proceedings for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the @entity29 by their parents as children			2
in the @entity182 plan there were caveats on who was eligible			0
in order to apply , immigrants needed to be younger than 31 at the time the rule was enacted , and younger than 16 when they were brought to the @entity29			0
and applicants are required to either be in school , have earned a high school degree or be honorably discharged veterans			0
the @entity205 , a nonpartisan think tank , says 1.2 million people were eligible under those rules and nearly 700,000 applied for deferred deportation , with hundreds of thousands more aging into the requirements over the next decade			0
but many more would become eligible if @entity0 expands , or eliminates altogether , those requirements , which were meant to encompass the same sector that would have qualified for permanent resident status under the @entity213 , which has languished in @entity39			1
the sources said that some parents of @entity29 citizens and legal permanent residents , or so - called " green - card holders , " would be granted legal status that allows them to work and avoid deportation			0
the president 's plan would affect those parents who have been in the @entity29 five years			1
that move would bring another 3.4 million people into the eligibility ranks , according to a @entity205 analysis			0
according to the two sources who spoke to @entity21 , any executive action is not expected to include broader use of so - called " parole " status			2
while some pro-immigration advocates support this idea , it is seen as a red line by many conservatives who view it as a potential way to provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who are parents of @entity29 citizens			0
currently such parole status is provided to spouses and family members of people serving in the @entity29 military			0
if the parents of children who are eligible under the current @entity182 rules were included , the number would rise to 3.7 million			0
changing those rules could also expand the eligible population : eliminating the education requirement , for example , would allow 430,000 more undocumented immigrants to be eligible for deferred deportation , the @entity205 estimates			0
and allowing people over 30 who were brought to the @entity29 by undocumented parents would allow another 200,000 immigrants to apply , the think - tank 's report says			0
immigration activists , frustrated with the rate of deportations under @entity0 and further exasperated with the delay in @entity0 's immigration action , have been urging the @entity11 to go big and expand the deferred deportation order in a way that allows the maximum number of people to stay			1
but many who have been watching the process closely believe the eventual announcement will fall short of those appeals			0
political football whatever @entity0 finally decides -- and at this point , the options seem clear -- he 'll be met with fierce blowback from @entity68 on @entity152 , who have spent months preparing for the announcement by warning of executive overreach and political well - poisoning			2
the @entity11 yielded to politics once already , delaying the immigration announcement from its promised debut this summer to a new date before the end of this year			1
the move was meant to shield vulnerable @entity155 from political attacks on the topic ; many of them lost their races anyway			0
the postponement was n't met kindly from immigration groups , who said there was n't time to spare on providing deportation relief for the millions of people who could be affected by new rules			0
there could still be election year ramifications , since @entity155 sen. @entity307 remains locked in a runoff contest with a @entity68 rival			0
but with the @entity311 firmly in @entity68 hands , any further delay would seem to offer little political advantage while only eroding support further among immigration reform activists			0
" for us , every day that there 's a delay , and every day that people have to wait , means more people unjustly deported , " said @entity316			0
some democrats want @entity0 to wait to announce the executive action after essential business clears the @entity11 and @entity311			1
sen. @entity325 , the outgoing @entity326 , told @entity21 the president should hold off any immigration action until a new bill funding the federal government is approved			2
he said enacting the immigration plan ahead of the spending measure could anger @entity68 and risk a government shutdown			2
" i 'd like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it			0
but it 's up to him , " @entity325 said			0
but no matter when the action comes , it seems destined to ignite @entity68 furor			0
the near certainty of an executive action by year 's end has n't slowed @entity68 efforts to stop it : this week a @entity68 congressman from @entity349 , rep. @entity350 , said if @entity0 goes forward with the plan , impeachment proceedings could be a possibility			1
those threats are n't exactly a new thing			0
@entity155 have raised millions of dollars by warning their party 's base about impeachment threats from conservative @entity11 members			2
more real is the threat that taking executive action on immigration forestalls any legislative effort on the matter			0
@entity68 leaders on @entity152 say a new plan delaying deportations would enrage @entity68 , leaving little political will to push through a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system			2
@entity0 seems little concerned by @entity68 threats against making the immigration move , however , pointing out they had an opportunity to pass a bipartisan reform measure in the @entity11 but balked			1
" i feel obliged to do everything i can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we do n't keep on making the system worse , " he said during last week 's news conference .			0
