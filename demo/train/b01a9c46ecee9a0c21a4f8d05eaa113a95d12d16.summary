@entity0 , @entity1 -- nearly 3,900 people , including about 540 children , are believed to have died from the @entity7 flu in the first six months of the epidemic , the @entity3 said thursday			1
the figure is a sharp increase from previous counts of laboratory - confirmed cases			0
but dr. @entity13 , the director of the @entity14 , said the estimate gives a " more accurate picture " of the scale of the pandemic			2
the figure was based on a detailed analysis of data from several dozen districts around the country , she said			0
the method used to calculate the mortality figures is similar to that used to produce estimates of ordinary seasonal flu deaths , which are believed to number about 36,000 a year			1
an estimated 22 million people in the @entity30 have contracted the virus , commonly known as swine flu , resulting in about 98,000 hospitalizations through october 17 , @entity13 said			1
among children under 18 , about 8 million are believed to have been sickened , 36,000 have been hospitalized and 540 have died , a much higher number than the 129 laboratory - confirmed child deaths the @entity3 reported november 6			1
about 12 million adults up to age 64 had been reported ill , with 53,000 hospitalizations in that age group and 2,900 deaths			2
people over age 65 accounted for 2 million illnesses , 9,000 hospitalizations and 440 deaths , @entity13 said			2
the prevalence of flu cases is higher than at any time since the @entity48 , she said , but the death rate is " nowhere near the severity of the 1918 pandemic			1
" @entity13 said 41.6 million doses of @entity7 vaccine are now available , up from 38 million last week , but " not as much as we 'd hoped to have by today			0
" she told reporters last week that about 8 million new doses were expected this week			0
the @entity56 has ordered 75 million doses of swine flu vaccine for delivery by year 's end , and the @entity3 had predicted that 40 million doses would be available by the end of october			1
production delays have hampered agency plans , and the lag has led to criticism of the program			0
a @entity69 survey released tuesday found @entity30 are starting to lose confidence in the government 's ability to prevent a nationwide epidemic , though a narrow majority continue to say that the government and private industry will eventually produce enough of the vaccine to inoculate everyone who wants it .			0
