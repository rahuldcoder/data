@entity0 plans a three - day nationwide lockdown in an effort to halt an @entity4 outbreak that has killed hundreds , a move that a leading medical charity said saturday will not help			1
people will not be allowed to leave their homes for three days under the plan , set to start september 19			1
the lockdown is being billed as a predominantly social campaign rather than a medical one , in which volunteers will go door - to - door to talk to people			1
" we believe this the best way for now to identify those who are sick and remove them from those who are well , " said @entity17 , @entity0 's minister of information and communication			1
but @entity24 , also known as @entity24 , said such a lockdown is unlikely to stop the spread of the disease			2
" large scale coercive measures like forced quarantines and lockdowns are driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers			1
this is leading to the concealment of cases and is pushing the sick away from health systems , " the charity group said in a statement			2
" this is leading to the concealment of potential cases and is pushing the sick away from health systems			0
" it 's not the first time a quarantine or lockdown has been tried			1
in august , the @entity52 government locked down one of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital of @entity56 in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus			0
the move resulted in riots			0
21,000 volunteers to go door - to - door @entity0 set the lockdown date for september 19 - 21 to give the country time to train volunteers and get needed equipment , such as ambulances , @entity17 said			1
during the lockdown , 21,000 volunteers will fan out across the nation to talk with people about how to protect themselves from the disease , as well as identify @entity4 cases , @entity17 said			1
it was unclear how many of these volunteers would be health workers			2
the information minister described the volunteers as young people from the very communities where they will be working			1
" resistance will be less			0
they will be talking to people they know , " @entity17 said			2
he did not say what punishment , if any , people would face for violating the lockdown			1
@entity4 typically kills 90 % of those infected with the virus , but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped because of early treatment			0
even so , @entity24 questioned such a plan			2
" it will be extremely difficult for health workers to accurately identify cases through door - to - door screenings as this requires a certain level of expertise , " the group said			1
" and when cases are identified , there will not be enough @entity4 management centers to care for them			0
" number of cases on the rise also , there is a question of what a three - day lockdown will do to slow the spread of the virus , given that the @entity4 incubation period can range between two and 21 days			1
the virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids , and early symptoms include sudden onset of fever , weakness , muscle pain , headaches and a sore throat			0
more than 3,600 people have been diagnosed with @entity4 since the first documented case in december , the @entity121 has said			2
of those cases , there have been 1,800 fatalities , the agency has said			0
more than 40 % of the cases have been diagnosed in the past three weeks , the agency said			0
the outbreak has been centered in @entity131 , @entity0 and @entity52 , with a handful of cases in @entity134			1
the overall fatality rate is 50 % , @entity121 said , ranging from 39 % in @entity0 to 64 % in @entity131 , according to the latest figures			2
who says it believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the ebola virus in @entity142 , passing on the virus to other animals			0
humans contract @entity4 through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans			0
the virus is named after the @entity152 in the @entity153 ( formerly @entity153 ) , where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976			0
the same year there was another outbreak in @entity158			0
while there is no known cure or vaccine available , the first human trial of an experimental @entity4 vaccine began this last week .			0
