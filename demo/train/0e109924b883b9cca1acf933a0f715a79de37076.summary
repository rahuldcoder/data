-- @entity3 , @entity2 , resident @entity1 is worried about the spike in the number of pistol permits sought in his small town after a gunman massacred children and adults at an elementary school there last december			1
" i am concerned that it can get out of hand , " he said			0
" you only have two hands			0
how many guns can you fire at once ? " his concern prompted him to create the @entity20 in the wake of the shooting at @entity23 that claimed the lives of 20 children , all aged 6 or 7 , and six adults			1
its mission : to reduce gun violence			1
" @entity30 is n't in the lexicon			0
what we 're about is gun safety and anti-gun violence , " @entity1 , who does n't own a gun and does n't intend to , told @entity0 in a recent interview in @entity3			1
in the months since @entity41 shot through the doors of the elementary school and targeted children in classrooms , the demand for guns in this western @entity2 city has jumped			2
as recently reported by the @entity46 , the @entity47 issued 171 pistol permits in 2012			2
as of august 8 this year , it has issued 209 permits , already a 22 % increase over last year 's total			2
if applications continue at this rate , @entity3 is on track to double the amount of pistol permits it issued last year			1
five things to know about guns and while government data show the number of @entity64 who own guns has been declining for several decades , experts say we are now seeing more guns in the hands of fewer @entity64			2
" i think it 's a little bit of a reaction to what 's going on both here and across @entity64 where i think the gun owners are seeing there is this huge outcry in the @entity64 to reduce gun violence and there 's a perception that the government is going to come and grab all their guns , or is not going to allow them to purchase certain guns , " said @entity69 , another @entity3 resident who 's also a member of the @entity20			1
that 's one reason why @entity84 -- a widow , grandmother and former @entity3 resident who 's never owned a gun -- applied for a permit to buy one in january			1
she lived in @entity3 for 28 years before recently moving to the nearby town of @entity93			1
" @entity96 did not prompt me , " she said of applying for the permit , which she finally got in may			0
" when i started to hear all the gun control talk , that 's what prompted me , " @entity84 said , adding that she 's looking to buy her first firearm now because she wants to be able to protect herself in her home , if needed			2
it was also a reaction to the tougher gun laws the state of @entity2 passed in april , she explained			1
" our rights are being slowly infringed upon and that this whole idea of controlling guns has come to my backdoor			2
in other words , there may be a time when i may never be able to get a firearm , " said @entity109			0
the new gun legislation in @entity2 is among the toughest in the nation			2
it adds more than 100 guns to its list of banned assault weapons and limits the capacity of magazines to 10 rounds			2
it also mandates the creation of the nation 's first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of a dangerous weapon , among other things			2
@entity3 - based firearm trade group sues for repeal of @entity2 gun law the new laws in @entity2 prompted @entity137 to buy another gun this year			1
" i thought it was 100 % certain they were going to pass more strict gun laws , " said @entity137 , a @entity3 resident who owns multiple guns but did n't want to discuss what types of firearms he has			1
for him , it 's a matter of protecting his wife and two children			0
" i do n't criticize police departments , they simply ca n't be everywhere			0
just like @entity150 , they could n't be everywhere , " he said			0
" so i think at the end of the day , an individual has to take responsibility for themselves			0
" @entity137 believes @entity2 's new gun laws put residents in danger			1
" the restriction on magazines is a real threat to people who are law abiding citizens that just want to protect themselves and their family			2
" @entity166 , whose daughter , @entity167 , was among the victims at @entity150 , said the increase in pistol permits in @entity3 is " sad , it 's really sad			1
" " it makes me sad to think that people , they think they 're protecting themselves , but they 're just adding to the problem			2
" @entity150 was a substitute teacher at the elementary school			0
her family says her lifelong dream was to be a teacher			0
" it does n't compute in my brain that you buy more guns because somebody got shot at the school , " her father said , adding that he had his first dream about his daughter just last week -- the first since she died			0
" that does n't change anything			0
it 's going to make things worse			0
" gun demand surges nationwide the @entity196 says there have been 38 straight months of increased gun sales in the @entity64			1
in @entity2 , the number of background checks for potential gun purchases rose nearly 53 % from the six months before the @entity3 mass shooting to the six months after			1
@entity204 statistics show the number of background checks it conducts nationwide has also steadily increased over the last three years			1
in 2012 , the @entity204 conducted 19,592,303 background checks on potential gun buyers , compared with 14,409,616 in 2010			0
but , the @entity204 notes , " a one - to - one correlation can not be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale " because of differing state laws			0
according to the most recent data from the @entity214 , roughly 6.5 million guns were manufactured in the @entity64 in 2011 , nearly a million more than in 2010			0
has the moment passed ? why gun control push fizzled tragedy spurs gun sales in the year following the january 2011 mass shooting in @entity221 , @entity222 -- in which 20 people , including congresswoman @entity224 , were shot and six people were killed -- the number of background checks for potential gun purchases conducted by the @entity204 in @entity222 increased by nearly 50,000 from 2010			1
there was a similar spike in @entity231 following the mass shooting at an @entity234 movie theater in july 2012 in which 12 people were killed and 58 were injured			0
the number of @entity204 background checks for those attempting to buy a gun in @entity231 increased 44 % from the year before the @entity234 shooting to the year following it			1
back in @entity3 , @entity69 says he wants to educate people about gun violence			1
he does n't want his city to be remembered only for the senseless shooting that happened there			0
" we have a real desire here to be remembered as the place that made a difference in the world			0
i think we make a difference in the world by transforming our culture and trying to change the gun culture in a positive way so we can reduce the risk of another @entity150 occurring , " @entity69 explained			0
" my heart breaks for them			0
it truly does , " says @entity109 , referring to the victims of the @entity3 shooting and their families			1
but , she says , " did the guns cause the tragedy ? no. it is the person behind the gun that caused the tragedy			1
