my friend was just murdered under the guise of revolution			1
two unhinged people walked into a restaurant in sunny @entity8 and attacked my friend @entity9 and his partner , @entity10 , shooting them dead as they ate their lunch			1
they then turned and yelled something about it being the " start of the revolution , " witnesses said			1
they left behind a " @entity17 " flag and a swastika			0
they killed another person at a @entity20 and then themselves			0
these two did n't start a revolution			1
they just took the lives of two heroes			2
they tore fathers from children and turned wives into widows			0
they brought darkness into the lives of all who loved these two men and another bystander			2
they traumatized people who witnessed the tragedy			2
they left a scene of carnage for dozens of fellow police workers -- the fallen cops ' friends , colleagues -- to process emotionally and mentally			2
all for some perverse , horrific act masquerading as revolution			2
authorities say that the shooters viewed law enforcement as oppressive and that they had participated in anti-government protests			0
but you do n't start a revolution by ambushing two innocent men in a fast food restaurant			1
they were n't " big government henchmen			1
" they were two good cops			1
we may all have problems with cops sometimes			2
who has n't felt angry after getting pulled over ? and yeah , i know some cops are just plain bad			1
some are just out to push people around			2
some are drunk on their authority and try to dominate everyone they encounter			2
but anyone who knows any cops personally knows that those are the exceptions			2
because for the most part , cops are good folks simply doing our dirty work			1
they are the society 's janitors , taking out the trash and cleaning up the messes none of us want to deal with ourselves			0
like you and me , they work for a paycheck , only their office is a squad car , their market is something like the @entity92 and their briefcase is generally a 9 millimeter			0
unless you are in fact " a bad guy , " most of these men and women in uniform are n't making your life more difficult , they 're making it easier			1
they are not a target of your revolution ! whatever your desired revolution , it should n't take its power from cowardly acts of violence inflicted on the innocent			1
@entity9 's killers should be shunned in the public memory -- there is no cause that can redeem them			1
their brave victims are the ones to be honored and celebrated			0
my friend , @entity9 , was a dynamite guy			1
he was a riot to be around : kind and funny , capable of ridiculously juvenile behavior but also profound intellectual depth			0
@entity9 helped me build the shed in my backyard			1
he was a tireless worker , and once he was done with a job , he 'd be the one bringing you a lemonade			0
@entity9 was a family man , a devoted husband and dad , and with the birth of a daughter , he was relishing the joy of being a new father again after over a decade of raising his first two wonderful kids			1
he liked to swim with his kids in the backyard			0
he loved going dancing in clubs with his wife			0
he was remarkably patient in training and tolerating the family 's lovable but absolutely insane dog , @entity139			0
as a cop , @entity9 was top notch			1
when it came time for business , he was the first guy through the door , the one you would want showing up if you were in any kind of danger , because he was fearless and capable			0
and now @entity9 is dead , because two jerks decided they could n't patiently let the system work like the rest of us			1
they could n't control their impulses			2
they could n't act like adults			0
these were not heroes or revolutionaries			0
they were cowardly psychopaths who chose to throw a terrifying tantrum			0
if you 're frustrated with government , if you 're worried about the republic , if you 're convinced black helicopters are watching you in the night or there is something else under your skin , there 's something you can do : start a blog , write a book , go to a protest , join a cause , call a senator , call a talk show , run for office			1
do what people in a free society do , not what out - of - control adolescents in " @entity183 " would do			0
and if you just ca n't restrain yourself from going on a murderous rampage followed by your own cowardly suicide , do the rest of us a favor and do it in reverse order			0
shooting a cop does n't make you a revolutionary			1
it just makes things worse for everyone			0
thanks for making my life better than it would have been otherwise .			0
