-- on wednesday , gov. @entity1 signed @entity3 's @entity2 into law			1
many gun proponents love @entity6 , but it will create unintended problems for law enforcement , local governments and the citizens they serve			2
although changes in the state 's gun laws were meant to strike a balance between the rights of gun owners and the government 's interest in protecting its citizens , unintended consequences may follow that do n't make anybody safe			1
picture this : it 's a pleasant summer day			0
the kids are out of school , and you 've decided to take them to the local park			0
you 're sitting on a park bench in the shade , watching them play , when you suddenly notice a man dressed in a heavy winter coat approaching the playground			0
as he scurries past you , you notice a handgun strapped around his waistband			0
alarmed ? you should be			0
who is this man , and why is he armed at your children 's playground ? concerned enough to call the local police ? not a bad idea , but here is the problem			2
starting july 1 , law enforcement in @entity3 will not be able do much for you			1
as a matter of fact , they could get sued if they detain the man you called about and ask him whether he has a valid weapons carry license			0
that 's because , under @entity3 's revised @entity2 , it is prohibited for police to detain someone for the purpose of checking for a license			1
but wait , it gets better			0
worried about convicted felons toting guns ? rest assured , convicted felons are still prohibited from possessing firearms in @entity3 -- except in the act of self - defense			1
but , you might ask , do n't you have to possess a firearm first in order to be able to use it in self - defense ? correct			1
so , what kind of sense does that make ? it does n't			2
it encourages gun ownership and use by convicted felons			1
all they have to do now is claim " self - defense			1
" feeling safer already ? finally , @entity3 's revised @entity2 may also cost you more money			1
before this law , cities could simply prohibit firearms or any other weapons in government buildings by posting a sign ; now , they can do so only by screening entrances into the government building with security personnel			2
and guess who ends up paying for that ? that 's right , the taxpayer			0
and if the police officer is sued for asking to see a gun carry permit , who will pay for his or her defense ? it will be up to the municipality , using taxpayer funds			1
but not only does it cost us more , it also has a chilling effect on open government			0
many citizens might feel discouraged from visiting their local government offices , knowing that they are now subject to being screened			0
while these revisions certainly favor the rights of gun owners , they create dilemmas for local law enforcement and government			2
as a police chief , my main concern is the safety our residents			0
as police , we have taken an oath to protect and serve , and this new law does n't help us .			2
