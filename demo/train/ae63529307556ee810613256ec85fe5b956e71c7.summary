@entity0 , @entity1 -- through choking traffic and crude streets , pastoral scenes and fields of wheat , there is a journey to be made in the heart of the @entity11 that will take you to the very soul of the beautiful game			1
for a country some have come to see as the world 's leading exporter of terror , it is a glimpse into all that is possible when you consider that for decades now @entity1 has also been a leading exporter of hand - stitched soccer balls			1
this is no cottage industry , in a typical year @entity1 produces almost half of the world 's hand - stitched gems			1
in a @entity30 year like this one , as demand explodes , that portion edges up to almost 70 percent			1
the craft here has been handed down for generations and now hundreds of stitching halls dot the agricultural landscape of this region			2
" a good player will play with this ball , it makes me feel good , it brightens our country 's reputation and that makes me feel proud , " says one young man as he continues stitching about six to eight balls a day			1
that will earn most of these workers anywhere from six to 10 dollars a day , as much as double @entity1 's minimum wage			1
@entity50 is the owner of the aptly named @entity51			0
for almost two decades he has won big - brand contracts against the odds and is currently a prime supplier for @entity55			1
" the ball stitched in @entity1 will definitely be of a higher quality , " said @entity50			1
he adds that he has great admiration for the stitchers that craft his perfectly rounded balls			1
" it 's hard work -- you need very strong upper body strength to do that , and this is not easy			0
they are doing the job by hand but it looks like some machine , " adds @entity50			2
for years now , @entity51 has been binding the tradition of craftsmanship with the demands of research and development			0
their goal here is to not just meet , but surpass @entity79 standards			1
balls are poked repeatedly and pressed for hours to test water resistance			2
then they are heat - tested to simulate how they will be after two years			2
and then there is the shooter machine , where a ball is kicked repeatedly by a shooting machine more than 3,500 times			2
the stitching string is stressed , there is even a machine that simulates headers , all of it part of the struggle in keeping @entity97 manufacturers from dominating the game			0
" without competing with @entity97 no one can stay nowadays in the industry			0
things are very simple you have to exactly do what your customer needs , " said @entity50			0
@entity50 chuckles when this reporter points out the official @entity30 ball will come from @entity97 this year			1
he admits , it does bother him a bit			0
in fact , @entity97 with its massive production scale and low currency is the threat here , not the @entity113			0
and yet the stigma of terror is one more thing to overcome			0
" it hurts in a big way , because it stops a lot of people from abroad ... because especially from the @entity122 people do n't want to travel here			0
many big brands have a travel ban , " says @entity50			0
but @entity1 is still in the game			1
forward @entity51 says it has worked hard to keep up with tougher quality standards and lower prices , and it says it has eradicated child labor from the production pipeline			0
" we are not those kind of people , we are honest , we do good work here , the world knows our product			0
we make products not war , " said one long - time employee			2
this industry defies @entity1 stereotypes but there is no pretending the game sparks passion here			1
that is reserved for cricket ; it 's the business of the game that takes all the glory here .			0

@entity1 is leading exporter of hand - stitched soccer balls
this year , @entity1 could produce 70 percent of the global supply
one @entity1 company is the prime supplier to @entity55
each ball must comply with tough @entity79 regulations
