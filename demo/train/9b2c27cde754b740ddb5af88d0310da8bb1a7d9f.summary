-- one of the most powerful experiences in life is to have deep , meaningful connection			1
without it we are empty			2
each message i received about my struggle with psoriasis was a new connection that brought with it a tapestry of fulfillment , gratitude and inspiration for me			1
many of you have asked me about diet			1
for me , it was , the most long - term solution to heal my severe psoriasis then , requiring the toughest self - discipline and a team of cheerleaders			1
here 's what i did , with what i learned at the clinic in @entity28 , and my mother , @entity31 's help			1
@entity32 and i also used the book " @entity34 : the @entity35 " by dr. @entity36 to help explain diet in more detail and the science of natural healing			1
stuff i did not eat : @entity42 , coffee , tea , soda , red meat ( except for lamb ) , shellfish , oranges ( i had very little citrus at all ) , " hot " spices , pumpkin , onions , garlic , tomato , mushrooms , eggplant , peppers , chili , paprika , cheese , white rice , white flour , bread , eggs , butter , cookies , chocolate , alcohol , tobacco , cranberries , blueberries , plums , strawberries , cream , lentils , peas , white potatoes , yeast			2
stuff i could eat : brown rice or wild rice , plain chicken or lamb , honey , apple , melon , banana , leafy green salads ( no dressing ) , plain low - fat yogurt , celery , spinach , broccoli , corn , sweet potato pear , papaya , apricot , grilled fish , turkey , wholegrain muffin or bagel , bran , almonds , low - fat milk , wholegrain pasta			2
@entity32 and i devised some menus like this : breakfast : @entity118 in hot water , high fiber cereals / bran and milk , papaya , low fat yogurt , chamomile tea , occasional eggs			2
lunch and dinner : stir - fry vegetables ( celery , carrots , @entity126 beans , corn , cabbage , broccoli ) in one desert spoon of olive oil along with fresh herbs , like basil , rosemary , oregano and fresh coriander , salt and pepper to taste			2
apricots , honey ; grilled lamb with salt , pepper and honey -- white sauce over it , ( made with wholewheat flour , milk and seasoning )			1
@entity150 grilled chicken with olive oil , salt and pepper plus honey ; fresh chicken soup ; grilled turkey breast ; roasted duck ( white meat only ) ; wholegrain pasta in white sauce ; grilled fish ( trout or sole or mackerel ) ; vegetable lasagna			2
all foods served with leafy green salads and with vegetable sides such as asparagus with low fat margarine , steamed cauliflower with beans , broccoli and carrots , corn or sweet potato			0
sweet tooth : baked bananas , stewed apple or pear , plain low fat yogurt with fruit , pomegranate , dates , cantaloupe , fruit salad , whole grain , apricots and prunes			0
drinks : diluted apple juice , melon juice , low fat milk , and water			0
munchies : carrots , salad , pear , apple , avocado , sunflower seeds , @entity202 biscuits , snack bars that are oatmeal ( no preservatives or coloring or flavoring )			0
vitamins : @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 exercise : i worked out for at least 1 - 2 hours a day			0
steam : i drank two liters of cooled @entity218 yellow saffron tea while sweating in the steam room for at least 30 - 60 minutes a day			0
i would go in and out repeatedly so - as not to overheat			0
i would rest and eat bananas afterwards ( which contain potassium )			0
meditation : at the clinic in @entity28 , i learned how to do deep relaxation and creative visualization			1
three times a day i lay on the floor of my bedroom for at least 30 minutes and meditated			0
i imagined myself windsurfing in a bikini with the naked sun on my clear skin			1
i imagined making a deal with my psoriasis , i would maintain the diet , and it , in turn would go away			1
i visualized that all the time			0
i used naturally based topical creams from the @entity238 clinic to help sooth my skin			1
the clinic is now closed			1
remission this worked for me back then and put me in remission for about 10 years , where i could eat anything i wanted and live completely normally			1
i have suffered recently from significant flare - ups that are stress induced ( need to handle stress better ... )			0
i needed a " quick fix " and first was on @entity249 injections , then @entity250 and now @entity251 , a biologic drug , which is currently helping			0
there is clearly a place for medication like this in healing , but my experience with diet forces me to believe that is a longer term , side effect - free solution			2
there is much debate in the value of food : which are immune boosters , what is more or less acidic , what is toxic for certain illnesses , is gluten - free the way to go ; can food only provide cures ? there is no one size fits all			0
the only universal truth in all this , for me , is maintaining a positive attitude no matter how hard it is , with the love and support of friends and family			0
once again , thank you			0
for more information on psoriasis , @entity288 suggests visiting the @entity291 ( @entity218 ) , @entity292 ( @entity293 ) or @entity294 ( @entity295 )			1
medical advice is that sufferers work with their doctors to establish a treatment plan			0
