-- we all know the slogans meant to express empathy and solidarity : " we are @entity5			1
" " we are all @entity6			0
" " i am @entity8			0
" the " we are @entity10 " messages have already begun , and we will likely see more			1
the well - intended connections seldom work			0
most of us are not columbine because most of us did not lose children in our community in a high school mass shooting			0
we are not all @entity6 because only some of us experienced the aftermath of 9/11 at @entity18			0
i am not @entity8 because i am not a black male			2
are we @entity10 ? that 's a harder question			1
@entity10 has a median household income of $ 36,645 and an unemployment rate topping 13 %			1
and as the world now knows , @entity10 's overwhelmingly white police force arrests blacks at a pace nearly four times higher than whites			1
on the other hand , although you would n't know it from most of the news coverage , @entity10 is also one of the most racially integrated municipalities in @entity34			1
it includes not only working - class blacks and white professionals , but also black professionals and working - class whites			1
and many of @entity10 's residents bridge racial and socioeconomic lines in their neighborhoods			1
with all of its complexities , @entity10 does not sound like my world			1
i teach at @entity48 , where most of my colleagues and students are white			0
i shop at mostly white places that feel safe and convenient			0
most of the contentious issues in my mostly white neighborhood are about bike paths and trees			0
many of you live in my world			2
it would be easy for those in my world to say we are not @entity10			1
but highlighting our differences misses something important : we are part of the reason for the circumstances that it confronts today			2
we may not be @entity10 , but we helped make @entity10			1
that we made @entity10 is reflected in politics and geography			1
@entity10 is one of dozens of municipalities nestled around @entity71			1
like many large urban areas in this country , each @entity71 municipality is separately incorporated with its own police force , schools and tax base			2
i pass through three of them to get to my local grocery store -- and @entity10 's burned down @entity81 is just seven miles from my workplace and house			1
in the best cases , these divisions create the possibility for good local government and communities where friendship and civic involvement can flourish			2
in the worst cases , they provide opportunities for self - interest and exploitation			0
@entity71 has some of the best ; it also has some of the worst			0
the worst cases are often tied to the issues of race and class			2
we made @entity10 because our choices reinforce racial and class divisions that manifest not only in cultures and attitudes , but also in schools , neighborhoods , churches and businesses			1
many of us do not live in large urban areas			2
but we , too , made @entity10 because we 're complicit in a system of criminal justice that disproportionately harms black men , and therefore , the black community			1
we made @entity10 because we do not address the vast and growing injustices for @entity115 's poor -- black and white			1
we made @entity10 because too many of us would rather tweet than get involved in the messiness of local politics and community building			1
the hard work of solving problems does n't happen from hashtag campaigns or writing blog posts and articles -- like this one			2
we made @entity10 because we have more tolerance for riots after sporting events than for citizens protesting injustice			1
we stand by and watch the government 's most egregious violations of our first amendment rights when the protests are about the things that matter most			0
and that 's true not only of the initial police response to @entity10 , but also of the restrictions placed on many of the occupy demonstrations , on some labor protests and in many other instances of political and religious dissent in recent years			1
@entity10 does not have any easy solutions			1
but we need to begin by talking about the problems in a more honest and self - reflective way			0
we need to start having the tough conversations that many of us too often avoid out of fear , ignorance or inconvenience			0
some of us have been engaged in these conversations for a long time			0
but many of us , especially many people whose lives and neighborhoods and workplaces look a lot like mine , have not yet begun			0
whether we 've already been talking or are just about to start , we need to risk awkwardness and misunderstanding as we stumble toward dialogue			0
and we need to extend grace to one another as we take those risks			0
but we ca n't just talk			0
we need to be willing to share time and experiences that lead to friendships , not just conversation partners			0
we might look to @entity10 to see what else must come next : learning about the issues , better supporting local businesses and nonprofits , expanding voter registration and voter education , monitoring local courtrooms and bureaucrats and holding accountable those officials who have used their power for harm rather than for good			2
we can do these things after the cameras go away and where the cameras have never been			0
we may not all put bodies on the line for the largely peaceful demonstrations			0
but we can put them on the line in the months and years to come -- by choosing to engage in the slow and difficult work of restoring communities			0
we owe at least that much to @entity10 and to all the @entity188 across our country .			2

@entity191 : slogans like " we are all @entity5 " are n't true , nor is " we are @entity10 "
@entity191 : not all of us live in those circumstances , but we all made @entity10 come into being
he says we reinforce racial and class divisions that affect neighborhoods , schools
@entity191 : we allow a system that disproportionately harms black men and neglects *inequality*
