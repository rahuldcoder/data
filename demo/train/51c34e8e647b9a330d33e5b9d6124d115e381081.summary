from the first time you step into eastern @entity2 , you find yourself surrounded by the exotic and extraordinary , be it flora and fauna or the just plain incongruous -- the severed wing of a @entity9 aircraft stored on the side of the road , or a boy with a gun			1
the place is pulsating with the heat and energy of a population of people fighting to survive just one more day			2
but the violence here is as intense as this intoxicating , heady mix of @entity22 at its best and worst			2
@entity2 has been called the " rape capital of the world " by @entity24 special representative @entity23			1
reports record that 48 women are raped every hour			1
i have been working in the region for 10 years and have seen a tragic development in this unpunished crime against the heart of society			2
i first went to a town called @entity35 , deep in the forest			1
it was october 2001 and circumstances brought me to @entity2 rather than @entity39			1
a small twin - engined plane was the only way in			2
it was the height of the war and i was with a returning team from the medical ngo @entity45 ( @entity45 )			2
they had pulled out because of the regular attacks on the town , but had decided it was safe to bring their team of three back : there was such a need for medical help here			0
as the plane taxied its way precariously down the grass airstrip , we knew we were waving goodbye to the only escape route we had			0
i was there for a week			0
a week hearing terrifying stories of torture and rape			1
rape with sticks and guns , even bayonets			1
women told me of their daily choice -- to stay at home and face starvation			1
or , go out to the fields for food and be raped			0
most women chose the latter			1
it had become the norm			0
the war continued until 2003 , when a peace treaty was signed			0
officially , the fighting came to an end , but it did n't stop			0
i returned to @entity35 in 2005 to find the women i had interviewed and photograph four years earlier			1
it was an unsettling search , for most of those women had died or disappeared in the forest after an attack , never to be seen again			1
the new women i met had similar tales of horror			1
but there was a twist			0
the people i spoke to this time related organized rape camps , with daily roll - calls			1
there was a new efficiency in the rape , it had become an integrated part of the rebel forces lives			1
as these women told me , it was now systematic			1
some years later , in 2009 , i returned to make a film about rape and found a disturbing new trend			1
women told me how they expected to be raped			1
not once but many times			0
the women i met , spoke of gang rapes , three or four times			1
sometimes it was " only " two soldiers , more often gangs of men , 10 , 20 , over and over again			0
many had conceived children and the girl children , some just babies only a few months old , were being raped as well			0
rape has now become generational			1
in @entity127 , @entity125 , dr. @entity126 , a general surgeon continues to work tirelessly to repair these damaged women			1
i met one of his patients			0
she was a cheerful little girl , it was impossible not to be drawn to her smile			0
the nurse saw me playing with her said : " you know she 's @entity136 - positive			0
" she was just three years old			0
her twin sister had been killed when she and her mother had been raped			0
this little girl had been conceived from rape			1
it makes difficult reading , but not nearly as difficult as it is for the women survivors , who are living with the consequences and stigma of rape			1
not least one particular woman , @entity147			0
she 's tiny , barely five foot tall but is a giant of a personality			0
her story has inspired many of us , it is so bleak but also hopeful because she 's providing an answer to these women			1
the @entity22 beauty empowering women like so many women survivors , she too was rejected when she and her two teenage daughters were raped by militia men			2
her husband was murdered in front of her , chopped up and she was forced to eat his private parts			0
her two daughters @entity166 and @entity167 were 15 and 13 years old , and both of them conceived children			0
@entity147 's husband 's family rejected them and she brought her daughters and their babies to a market town hugging the shore of @entity176 to try and rebuild their lives			0
this year i made a film about her and her work			0
she 's taking care of 170 women at the moment , they call her @entity147			2
over the past 10 years she 's helped more than 6,000 victims of rape , providing them with a wide range of care -- practical , medical and psychological			2
she has created a community in an area that is not regularly attacked , providing support to anyone who wants it , and she uses a farm to bring them together			0
that field is their hope , their therapy and their source of food and income			0
they come to this refuge as victims , punished by the violation of rape , blamed and rejected by their families and the local community			2
@entity147 has become a mother figure to the women and their children -- the results of rape -- and as they plant , tend , harvest and finally sell their crops they begin to heal together			1
@entity147 tries to dream of a better future , but she 's also realistic			0
she wants her women to be able to stop doing manual labor in the fields and learn skills like sewing			2
but for that to happen , she believes , the fighting and the rape must stop			2
she looks me in the eye , and with a sigh , says : " but i do n't see either the rape or the fighting ending today			2
