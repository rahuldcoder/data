-- @entity1 , the @entity2 - nominated indie band that shot to the top of the billboard charts with its latest album , " @entity6 , " has come a long way since its basement - recording beginnings in @entity10 , @entity11			1
@entity12 , left , and @entity13 of indie band @entity1 discuss their newly released ep			1
together for more than 10 years and formed while its members attended @entity20 , the band has six studio albums behind them , their songs have graced popular tv and film soundtracks , and their sell - out tours have brought the musicians all over the globe			1
but the success is not something the group takes for granted			0
" we never got into this for world domination			0
there were never designs to be ' rock stars , ' " said @entity12 , guitarist and producer			1
" the fact that i get to make a living doing something that i just passionately love to do is something that i wake up every day and am thankful for , " added @entity13 , bass player			1
" it 's not lost on me ; it really is n't			2
" @entity1 , which is named after a song performed by the @entity44 in the 1967 @entity46 film " @entity45 , " released " @entity47 " last month			1
it 's a compilation of tracks that did n't find a home on " @entity6 " but that the band did n't want to lose forever			1
days before their most recent tour cycle ended and before the summer tour begins , @entity12 and @entity13 -- two of the band 's four members -- sat down with @entity0 to discuss the latest ep , the current bands that move them and the darkness that may or may not drive their music			1
@entity0 : talk to me about the band 's name , which was selected by @entity65 , @entity1 's founder			1
if you could turn back the clock , would you go with something different ? @entity12 : [ @entity65 ] was in a " @entity45 " all - the - time kind of phase			1
he made a grand proclamation from the couch at one point that if he ever had another band , he was going to call it @entity1			1
@entity13 : knowing what we know now , @entity65 has said that he would love to have shortened it somehow to a snappier name			1
we joke about changing it			0
@entity0 : to what ? @entity12 : exactly ! all the band names are taken			1
@entity0 : why release an @entity47 ( extended play ; more than a single but less than a full - on album ) right now ? is it a taste of things to come ? @entity13 : we 've always treated the @entity89 as kind of a side dish to the main course during an album cycle			1
these are songs that were recorded at the same time as the songs that made the album " @entity6			2
" they 're sort of part of this chapter of the band			2
for us , it 's a nice way to have some new songs to play on tour , kind of get some new material in the world and keep things interesting			2
it would be kind of weird to leave them on a reel someplace			0
@entity0 : how has the state of the economy , if at all , affected your tour and plans ? walla : this tour has done really , really well for us			0
if anything , i think that we 're more mindful of just the fact that in a world of so many entertainment choices how amazing it really is to be on a really successful , solid , good tour			0
@entity13 : we really have n't seen an impact			1
i expected there to be one , to be honest , but all the numbers are pretty consistent with all the touring numbers we 've ever done			0
@entity0 : let 's talk a bit about the persona of indie rock musicians : the depression , the melancholy , the darkness			0
what do your parents make of this ? are there any issues you 'd like to discuss ? walla : our parents are all terrible people			2
we all came from broken homes			0
( laugh ) @entity13 : we cry a whole lot ... ( laugh ) walla : it 's not by design			1
it 's sort of hard to explain , i guess			0
... we do this because music totally moves us in a complete and absolute sort of way			2
it ends up just coming out in heart - on - your - sleeve , heavy , sort of really personal ways			0
@entity13 : i 've always felt like it 's more about the bittersweet qualities of life than it is about the dark brooding			1
... it 's more about just being honest about the different stations that you find yourself in in life			2
@entity0 : what bands are you listening to these days ? who do you really like ? @entity13 : that 's the thing about being on the road with so many people that are music fans			1
there 's always a new record that someone 's found that we 're listening to			0
@entity65 is really kind of always combing through old records			0
i think [ @entity12 ] and i probably do more on the what 's new and what 's out in the world			2
the @entity192 , i hear them all the time now			0
walla : yeah , the @entity192 record 's great			0
there 's a band from @entity198 called the @entity199 whose record i just picked up			0
they 're a new band , it came out few weeks ago , and that 's totally doing it for me right now			0
... telekinesis from @entity198 , the new @entity207 record i think is great			0
those are the big ones right now			0
@entity0 : tell me about your political involvement and your backing of causes			0
( @entity12 , for example , got involved in the @entity215 campaign and has done some work for @entity217			2
) walla : it 's little things here and there , which is sort of how i feel activism should work			2
you ca n't do everything all the time , but you can do what you can when you can			1
i wish i could do more , but ... not everybody can be @entity228 .			1
