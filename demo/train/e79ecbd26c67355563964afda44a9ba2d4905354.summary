@entity1 's government made what may be its first official reaction to a campaign calling on @entity1 women to defy the country 's de facto driving ban on saturday , saying the kingdom 's " laws will be fully enforced " that day			1

addressing what it called " rumors exchanged over social networks and some media outlets calling for congregations and marches , " the @entity23 said that " the laws of the @entity34 prohibit activities disturbing the public peace and opening venues to sedition			1
" @entity1 blogger and opinion writer @entity39 , a supporter of the campaign who recently posted a video showing her driving in the city of @entity46 , noted that a @entity54 account supporting @entity1 political prisoners recently " tweeted a message saying you have to take advantage of this day , that it 's an opportunity to go out there and demonstrate and ask for the rights of the political prisoners			1
" " as soon as i read the @entity23 statement , i was sure the message was meant for them , not for those who will go out to drive , " she said , adding that women drivers will not be demonstrating that day			2
no traffic law specifically prohibits women from driving in @entity1 , but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle			2
