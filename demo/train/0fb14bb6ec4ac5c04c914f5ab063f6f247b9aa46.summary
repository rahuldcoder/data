-- you 've heard of @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , but how about @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 ? these ski resorts may lack the buzz of their more glamorous neighbors , but they make up for it in snowfall , value and fewer crowds			1
so hop on a lift before winter winds down			0
@entity18 - @entity17 opened in 2007 , @entity7 has remained largely off the radar thanks to its relative inaccessibility in @entity17 's @entity21			1
it 's a five - hour drive from @entity23 and two hours from the nearest international airport , but it 's unlikely to stay that way for long			1
with some 60 feet of annual snowfall at the highest elevations , 5,620 feet of vertical -- the longest descent of any resort in @entity31 -- and lift , cat - skiing and heli - skiing from one village base			1
@entity5 - @entity36 sandwiched between @entity37 and @entity38 , @entity5 has long been a local favorite , but a new high - speed quad - lift and ski - in , ski - out lodging put it on par with its big - name neighbors			1
naturally divided terrain separates skiers and snowboarders by ability , which gives the entire resort more elbow room			1
bonus : guests get free snow cat access on @entity54			0
the " @entity58 " deal this season packs in four days of skiing or riding for $ 234			0
@entity6 - @entity59 perched on the western slope of the @entity61 , @entity6 is perfectly positioned to reap the lion 's share of powder from eastern - moving storms			1
" there can be times when @entity3 can receive zero snow and the @entity6 can get a foot , " says @entity65 , spokesman for @entity66			1
plus , he adds , " the terrain is fantastic			1
" this year , the resort is offering free skiing and snowboarding to lodge guests with a 2012 season pass to any ski resort in the @entity77 or @entity78 to make up for the lack of snow elsewhere			0
lodging typically starts at $ 99 ; adult lift tickets run $ 69			0
@entity84 - @entity83 @entity85 or @entity86 may be @entity83 's most recognizable resorts , but @entity84 best reflects the @entity83 's independent streak			1
the cooperative - owned ski area does n't groom its trails , forbids snowboarding and keeps snowmaking to a minimum			1
" we prefer it from the heavens not the hoses , " says resort spokesman @entity94			0
ski magazine has ranked its terrain as the most challenging on the @entity101			1
the resort 's biggest claim to fame is its single - chair lift , the only one in @entity31			1
the mountain does n't own lodging , but there are plenty of classic ski lodges and cozy bed and breakfasts nearby , with rates from $ 85			0
adult lift tickets start at $ 45			0
@entity116 - @entity115 high up in @entity115 's panhandle nine miles outside of @entity119 , @entity117 is n't as accessible as other @entity121 resorts			1
as a result , it 's unlikely you 'll wait more than five minutes in the lift line			2
then there 's the 2,900 skiable acres -- more than neighbor @entity128			2
while the mountain is known for its off - trail skiing among the trees , the terrain varies from the bunny hill to steep , double - black pitches			1
the 6,400 - foot summit affords skiers panoramic views of @entity115 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity78 , as well as @entity140			2
slopeside digs start at $ 164 ; adult lift tickets at $ 67			0
@entity143 , @entity144 with its postcard - perfect @entity147 scenery , breathtaking verticals and charming chalets , @entity150 ¨ re is one of the most beloved ski resorts in @entity153			2
but @entity143 , its neighbor in the @entity155 -- a ski area in @entity144 's @entity157 named for famed alpine ski racer and native son @entity159 -- offers a similar experience and then some			2
a slew of off - beat activities like ice - karting , bungee - trampoline and ice - diving under a frozen lake appeal to families			2
together , the resorts , which are linked by cable cars , tunneled funitels and gondolas , offer nearly 200 miles of runs serviced by 102 lifts			0
@entity174 , @entity175 serious skiers know the season does n't end come summertime			0
it just shifts south of the equator			0
come august , @entity181 , 35 miles northeast of @entity182 , is blanketed in deep powder			2
newer than the storied @entity175 resort of @entity185 , @entity174 has all the bells and whistles of most modern mountains , including the only high - speed quad lift in @entity190 , a brand new gondola and an onsite heli - pad			2
backcountry skiing : beauty and fear at roughly $ 200 a shot and up to 4,500 feet of vertical in one run , heli - skiing is a relative bargain here			0
( ca n't wait for that first run ? hitch a chopper ride straight from @entity182			0
the resort will send your bags ahead )			0
lodging ranges from the budget @entity208 to the luxe @entity210			0
@entity208 runs $ 2,266 for seven nights ( friday to friday ) for two people , including lift tickets			0
seven - night packages include two interconnect tickets to neighboring resorts @entity217 and @entity36 , opening up 7,400 acres of skiable terrain .			1

new *features* put @entity36 's @entity5 on par with its big - name neighbors
@entity59 's @entity6 is well - positioned to *accumulate* powder
@entity84 's @entity83 terrain has been rated the most challenging on the @entity101
