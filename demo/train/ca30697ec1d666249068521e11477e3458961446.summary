-- @entity2 's election campaign was heavily infused with the rhetoric of change			1
voter turnout was the highest since the 1970s			0
a large number of new youth voters also entered the fray			0
yet the evolution of democratic culture in @entity2 produced a rather conventional outcome -- victory for a two - time former prime minister known for corruption and the military coup that ousted him in 1999			1
@entity17 and his party , the @entity18 -- @entity19 ( @entity18 ) will still be on the hook to produce change for over 180 million @entity2 -- and there is a lot to change			1
the good thing is that there is not a lot of confusion over what @entity2 's problems are			2
@entity17 's wide margin of victory also affords him a broad mandate to make bold policy decisions without the same political instability that plagued the outgoing @entity36 government			2
will he take advantage of this opportunity ? yes and no. @entity17 has rightly prioritized the economic situation , but he will still have to pick and choose his battles on reform			1
the economic challenges demand both short - term fixes and long - term reforms			1
most governments in @entity2 have opted for short - term fixes because the path to reform simply takes too long or lacks political support			1
@entity17 might have support in the @entity50 for some of the more difficult reforms , such as taxation and cutting energy subsidies , but the backing of special interest groups , trade unions and provincial governments among others will not always be guaranteed			2
real reform will require the buy - in of these stakeholders too			0
@entity17 could be the man to do it			2
he is a free - market oriented businessman who in his previous tenures as prime minister focused on privatization , infrastructure development and deregulation			1
but his views alone wo n't carry the country towards the free market			0
@entity17 will also need to strengthen his party 's links to economic and political stakeholders outside of @entity76 , where the @entity18 has a smaller presence than the other regional parties			1
a prime example of where @entity17 's outreach will be needed is in @entity82			1
the megacity contributes to over 20 % of the country 's gdp and is also home to a multi-billion dollar informal economy			0
these economic gains have been threatened by unprecedented violence between the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) , the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , and the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) -- all of whom are looking to benefit from the financial spoils			2
@entity82 's economic environment has no doubt learned to adjust to the fluctuating security situation , but the national government can not afford to let it get worse			2
fixing @entity82 will require @entity17 to garner the support of @entity90 , @entity36 , and @entity91 -- none of whom at this point look poised to join his government			1
security is the other area where @entity17 faces high expectations , but will be forced to be flexible and accommodating to competing interests			1
more than ever before , the @entity2 public , politicians and the military agree on the existential threat posed by the @entity2 @entity111			1
the military 's on again - off again campaign against these militants in the country 's @entity115 has failed to end violent attacks on ordinary citizens and government targets			2
the spike in attacks during the election campaign is evidence enough of that			0
@entity17 will have to find his public voice on militancy , an issue he has been resoundingly silent on			0
this is n't surprising considering his own @entity76 province is a hotbed of militant activity in the south			0
part of the problem is that the @entity18 - led government in @entity76 has not taken aggressive legal or police action against militant groups like @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity140 , some of whom in recent months have been implicated for their involvement in major attacks outside of @entity76			2
the lack of action against these groups seems to have protected the @entity18 against attacks during the campaign			0
there have also been fewer attacks within @entity76			0
@entity17 can not pursue this informal arrangement at a national level			0
he will also have to get behind the military 's campaign against the @entity2 @entity111 but has to be cautious in how forward he leans			1
@entity17 could continue to protect @entity76 at the expense of the country , or he could be bold and help the military wipe out the @entity2 @entity111 -- either way , he still loses a little			1
@entity2 deserve enormous credit for showing up in large numbers to vote in the face of such violence			0
@entity17 and the @entity18 should be congratulated on winning big , especially with so much hype in @entity76 over @entity165 , the famed politician and cricket star			1
but the high voter turnout and election victory just put @entity17 back on the map			0
based on the options he faces , there are plenty of reasons to be less sanguine on the prospects for quick and easy policy - making			0
it is now up to @entity17 to figure out how to navigate the long road ahead			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			0

@entity2 elects two - time former prime minister known for corruption and military coup
big expectations for @entity17 and his party , @entity18 -- @entity19
@entity17 must tackle economic challenges as well as security issues from @entity111
