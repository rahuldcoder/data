-- an old meatpacking plant on @entity3 's @entity2 is being transformed into an eco farm , which its founders says will produce food sustainably , while creating zero waste			1
@entity9 entrepreneur @entity8 is the founder of " @entity10 , " a vertical - farm initiative that he hopes will show people the ease of adapting to green food production in urban living environments			1
a vertical farm is an urban agriculture concept whereby food is grown in and on top of buildings in city areas			0
in order for this process to work , urban farmers use a variety of techniques , including hydroponics -- cultivating plants in water -- and aquaponics , which uses by - products from fish farming to assist hydroponic growth			0
with the world 's population surpassing seven billion people and the rapid pace of urbanization , finding space to grow food is becoming an increasing challenge -- one that @entity8 and his team of volunteers at @entity10 are rising to			1
watch : a farm on every roof top in 2010 @entity8 began repurposing the meatpacking plant and two years on it has opened its doors to both the public , and business opportunities			1
@entity8 says of the plant 's ethos : " it started out minimal ( waste ) because that 's how i 've always operated ... using as little resource as possible to do things			1
at a certain point i realized if we built an anaerobic digester , we could get our waste down to zero			0
" the plant 's anaerobic digester uses bacteria to break down organic waste into biogas -- comprised of methane and carbon dioxide -- and material that can be used as fertilizer			2
a " combined heat and power system " will convert the methane into energy , which @entity8 says will take the plant completely off grid and allow it to produce large quantities of food with zero waste output			1
despite still being under construction @entity10 currently has five tenants , including aquaponic farms , a hydroponic farm , bakers , tilapia fish breeders , a mushroom garden and a kombucha tea brewer ( a type of tea said to have health benefits )			1
their products are sold to local restaurants , cafes and markets , as well as used to produce more food within the farm itself			0

for example , the tilapia fish produce ammonia - based waste , which is sent through a biofilter before the nitrates are fed to plants growing in hydroponic beds			2
the plants absorb the nitrates , cleaning the water , which is then returned to the fish in an example of a " completed loop cycle			0
" @entity8 says : " the key to this farm is the closing of loops : energy loops ; resource loops ; money loops -- by keeping jobs local			2
if you can close the loops , you can make things more sustainable			0
" supported by $ 1.5 million in grant money from the @entity133 , the plant operates under a social - enterprise model , with a non-profit side and a for - profit side			0
it provides tours of the facility for interested members of the public and conduct lectures , outreach programs and demonstrations for the local community to show them how to grow food in various urban environments			0
@entity8 hopes to have the farm fully operational by 2014 and says that the facility will create 125 new local jobs .			1

@entity8 is building a zero waste *veritcal* farm on @entity3 's @entity2
it has bakers , fish farmer , tea brewer and other farms working with each other to use waste
@entity8 hopes this will show other businesses the ease of adapting to green initiatives
