" i would borrow my mom 's red @entity6 lipstick and smear it on like a clown ! " she says			1
" for sexy eyes , there is nothing better than this drugstore black liner			1
" nowadays , the 29 - year - old @entity13 , a single mom , tries to pass along subtler application tips to her 7 - year - old daughter			1
" i taught her ' a dab 'll do ya , ' " says the actress , who stars in the @entity21 comedy " @entity22			1
" " she 's going to wear it anyway , so she might as well have some experience			1
" did you pick up any makeup tricks working as a model ? one of my favorites is putting white pencil on the inside of the bottom eyelid for that very awake look			1
at night if i 'm in a hurry , i 'll just put on a lot of mascara and black pencil all the way around the inner rim			1
it 's a totally sexy eye in a minute and a half			1
what 's the one makeup item you ca n't live without ? i 'm in love with @entity47 foundation			2
i can do anything in that makeup and it stays			2
plus , it has sunscreen in it and gives me a really natural glow			2
you alternate between being a blonde and a brunette			1
which do you prefer ? my natural color is dark blond , but right now i like being a brunette			1
i did a movie last summer and they dyed my hair platinum -- i hated it			2
i have a big personality , and i think big personality plus blond hair makes me come across as glib			2
with dark hair , people look at your face more			2
before , it was all about the hair			2
how do you keep color - treated hair healthy ? i 've never found a conditioner that makes my hair feel as amazing as @entity80 's @entity79 shampoo by @entity81			2
my hairdresser used it on me one time , and now i 'm obsessed			0
i also use a new color from @entity85 -- it 's called @entity86 -- that 's incredible			0

i was a big user of the hot rollers and teasing			0
and i had mall bangs			0
i also wore my hair in a bun a lot because of all the dancing i did			0
i was n't really popular in high school			1
no one will believe you if you say you were n't popular			0
" @entity104 " was my nickname			1
i was totally gangly and a foot taller than all the boys			0
clearly you 've come a long way			0
what 's your secret ? i think it 's very important to take care of your skin			0
obviously the no. 1 thing is sunscreen			0
all my life i have used @entity116 as my daytime moisturizer because my mom did			1
i also use their foaming face wash			0
it 's the best makeup remover ever			0
and in the morning i use @entity123 cleanser because it has these tiny microbeads that are great for exfoliating			0
