@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's an awkward reality of royal reporting that we 're also in the fashion business			2
to be perfectly frank i 've no expertise nor credibility in this area but i do what i can by forwarding on any details i get from the palace			0
i also lean heavily on those who know what they 're talking about			0
i 'm certainly not dismissive			0
the " @entity19 " is a widely accepted phenomenon in the fashion business			1
@entity20 of @entity21 is n't known for high fashion ; in fact she often wears high - street outfits that might even be -- gasp ! -- out of season			1
but , when they 're available , they 'll sell out within hours of her wearing them , guaranteed			1
on tours like this one in @entity1 , there are new outfits appearing every day			2
when they 're in the vaguely affordable bracket -- such as the $ 325 @entity37 wrap dress worn last week -- then it 's spending spree time for her fans			0
fashion detectives @entity42 to this phenomenon is an intrepid troupe of digital fashion scouts who identify and source @entity45 's outfits within minutes of them appearing in public			1
chief scout would be @entity50 , best known by her @entity52 handle : @ @entity53			0
@entity50 was also the first to spot a potential challenger to @entity45 's royal fashion crown			1
" " having one 's child wearing the identical sweater a real - life @entity60 is wearing ? that has a lot of cachet			1
especially when it 's something you can find at your local @entity67 , " says @entity50			0
during @entity71 's main public engagement at @entity72 in @entity73 , he was dressed in a pair of " sailboat smocked dungarees " by the @entity78 designer @entity77			0
they were an instant sell - out in the smaller sizes			1
@entity50 says : " there is also the allure that comes with scarcity			0
if there is such a thing as the @entity89 baby then @entity85 is it			1
he is not paraded out and about , his parents are not making deals to sell rights to photographs of him , he is very much protected behind the proverbial @entity97 walls			2
nor is he seen wearing something new every time he is in public			2
" @entity20 has done the same thing with his wardrobe she does with her own : repeating and recycling outfits			2
while the @entity60 has worn some more upscale items , designer duds for the sandbox set if you will , he has also worn those pieces more than once			0
his little cardigan with the soldiers on the front ? seen at least twice on the tour			0
his blue dungarees with the sailboat ? worn twice			0
i do n't believe the @entity20 has any intention of turning him into a clotheshorse			0
" practical fashion ? @entity45 certainly has a more relaxed sartorial approach than her regal predecessors			1
" this has n't been a vintage tour as far as royal fashion goes , " says @entity121 , royal correspondent for the @entity78 's @entity123 newspaper			2
" but then , given the more casual nature of the trip , it has n't leant itself to it either			0
" so far in @entity1 , the talk has been more about @entity45 's shoes than her outfits , says @entity121 : " particularly the fact that the @entity20 has been wedded to her favorite wedge heels in even the most inappropriate situations			1
" she wore five inch @entity139 and @entity140 ' @entity138 ' wedges to walk around a mountain ledge with a stomach - churning 300 - foot sheer drop in the @entity143 , and on the world famous surf beach at @entity146 she doggedly kept on her four inch @entity148 ' heels as she walked across the sand - even though her most senior aide had kicked hers off			1
" who knew the subtle sacrifices a duchess makes in the name of fashion ? or , indeed , that i would be reporting on it ? princess @entity159 's favorite fairytale dress could be yours ... for a price sexy , skintight , sophisticated : how @entity164 's iconic dress has survived a century impossible fashion : mind - bending , @entity166 printed masterpieces			1

the " @entity19 " sees everything that the @entity45 wears sell out
the *website* what @entity45 wore identifies her outfits within minutes of her appearances
she is known for *championing* high - street labels , and wearing garments more than once
now @entity85 seems to have the same fashion pull
