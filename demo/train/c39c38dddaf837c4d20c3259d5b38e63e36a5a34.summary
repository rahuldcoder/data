-- @entity1 made several things very evident last sunday night : he 's confident			1
a " dogged mentality " helps , too , when it comes to lining up against the other guy			2
that other guy in the @entity8 was @entity9 , the object of the cornerback 's rant after the @entity13 earned their way to the @entity15 by beating the @entity16			2
" do n't you open your mouth about the best , " @entity1 barked on national tv , " or i 'm going to shut it for you real quick			1
" in the days since the outburst stirred controversy , @entity1 has become something akin to the upcoming @entity15 's unofficial provocateur - in - chief			1
but in an in - depth interview with @entity0 's @entity26 -- which aired friday night -- @entity1 expressed some regret about the rant while showing a far more gentler side when he 's off the field			1
" i 've always been a square , a nerd			1
kind of odd , kind of awkward , " he said			2
" i still am to this day			2
people just think i 'm a lot cooler ' cause i play football			0
" @entity1 said he likes the @entity38 and " @entity39 " on tv			1
the @entity42 grad lauded his parents , saying they set an example of going to work every day and not complaining			2
with his can - do attitude and philosophy " you got ta be who you are , " it 's fitting that one of his heroes is one of sport 's most outspoken athletes -- @entity54			0
like @entity54 in his day , @entity1 may now be the biggest newsmaker in sports following the @entity13 ' playoff victory			1
when he was about 7 or 8 years old , @entity1 saw @entity54 for the first time on the screen			1
@entity54 struck him as " so much different than everybody else in the world , " @entity1 said			1
" it was one of his interviews , " @entity1 said			1
" and he was just so clever , so well - spoken , so articulate -- so off - the - cuff			0
" he kind of went against the grain			0
... and that takes a lot of courage to go against the grain , to say what you really want to say			0
" cornerback stunned by rant reaction as the @entity13 and @entity72 prepare for the @entity15 on february 2 , @entity1 took a break from practice to speak with @entity26			1
he spoke of defying all odds by growing up in a @entity77 neighborhood -- @entity78 -- where violence is documented in rap songs , and working in school so hard and successfully that he later attended and played football at @entity42			1
5 things you should know about @entity1 " how almost oxymoronic does it sound that a kid from @entity78 is going to @entity42 ? " @entity1 said			1
" i was just trying to show ' em anything 's possible			0
" @entity1 has been publicly excoriated , particularly on social media , for his postgame comments			1
he told @entity26 he probably should not have attacked @entity9			0
" and that was immature and i probably should n't have done that			0
" still , he was shocked by some of the racists responses he received			0
" it was really mind - boggling the way the world reacted , " @entity1 told @entity26			2
the @entity100 all - pro defensive back told @entity26 he still feels the sting of not going in the 2011 @entity100 draft until the fifth round -- the 24th cornerback chosen			2
" you do n't know what to expect			0
you do n't know if your phone 's supposed to ring or if somebody 's supposed to text ... " he said			0
" when your phone just does n't ring , does n't have any activity , it 's really disheartening			0
" in the days since his rant , the phone is ringing for @entity1			2
his agent said the incident has ended up being more positive than negative for @entity1 's image			1
" i think that he 's more likeable , " said @entity118			0
@entity118 told @entity120 that interest in his client for endorsements has boomed since the remarks			0
" we have some new ( corporate ) players who have come to the table who are starting the conversation , " @entity118 said			0
@entity1 told @entity0 he is concentrating on moving forward , preparing for @entity72 superstar quarterback @entity130			1
for now , he has one objective			0
" on the football field , you 're still going out to there to win			0
and if you 're not going out there to win , what are you going out there for ? " @entity0 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			2

@entity1 talks with @entity0 about his @entity100 *career* , growing up
" i 've always been a square , a nerd , " athlete says
he pays tribute to his parents , talks of his neighborhood
agent says his image is now more positive than negative
