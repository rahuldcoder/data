when the planes struck the @entity3 on september 11 , 2001 , @entity1 detective @entity0 raced from @entity4 to the site to help look for survivors , along with his fellow police officers			1
" it was like a surreal scene			2
there was a lot of confusion , a lot of smoke , " he said			2
" you could n't see when you were trying to walk through the smoke to search for survivors			0
you know , you could barely see your hand in front of you			0
" @entity0 spent the next six months at the site			1
three years later , he was diagnosed with @entity23 's lymphoma , a cancer of the lymphoid tissue			1
he underwent extensive treatment , including stem cell transplants , radiation and chemotherapy			0
he is currently in remission			0
he had to drain his retirement savings to pay for medical bills not covered by insurance			1
firefighters responding to 9/11 at increased cancer risk " most city workers do have health insurance , but unfortunately a catastrophic illness such as cancer or anything like that , you know , not everything is covered , " he explained			1
" there is a lot of expenses that fly under the radar , you do n't realize it until you are getting them and like most police officers i know , you are only maybe like three or four paychecks away from the homeless shelter			0
" @entity0 is one of thousands of first responders , volunteers and residents who say they became ill as a result of working or living near the attack site			1
" people are terribly sick			0
people ca n't support their families			0
people are having trouble getting by , " said @entity62 , an attorney who represents @entity63 and 3,800 other first responders			0
" i have clients who have been evicted from homes			0
i have clients who ca n't pay their rent , their phones have been shut off , and these people are in desperate need of some assistance so that they can live their lives , " he said			0
" these are people that dropped everything and ran down to ground zero to try and help			1
i have clients who volunteered for the @entity78 , worked in @entity79			0
i have a client from @entity81 who was watching tv , got in his pickup truck , drove to @entity85 , and then spent four months on the pile , and he is so terribly disabled that he can barely walk up the stairs and is on oxygen 24 hours a day			0
" while 9/11 victims and their families received compensation from the federal government in the years immediately following the attacks , those who came in afterward to help with rescue , recovery and cleanup efforts and then became sick have yet to receive such assistance			0
for years they were caught up in disputes over whether the air at ground zero was really toxic -- the @entity100 long claimed it was safe -- and whether the illnesses could be linked to the attack site			1
in january 2011 , president @entity103 signed the @entity104 , named after @entity85 police detective @entity105 , who died of a respiratory illness after working at the @entity107			1
the law sets aside money for medical care and $ 2.775 billion dollars to compensate claimants for lost wages and other damages related to the illnesses			0
the money has yet to be dispersed , although lawyers and government officials involved in handling the claims expect payments to some who developed respiratory , digestive and other conditions to begin in the next couple of months			0
triple - amputee veteran gets ' smart ' home on september 11 cancer was initially rejected for coverage under the @entity104 , but that decision was reversed earlier this year			1
on monday , federal health authorities outlined the 58 types of cancer that will be included			1
" i think it is way far overdue as far as being added on , " @entity0 said			1
" common sense alone tells you that cancer was all along linked			2
" he went on to list several other police officers he worked with who had gotten cancer			2
" what are the odds with all of these people coming down with the same type of , the same exact type of cancer or a linked cancer ? " he asked			2
he said early in his career at the @entity1 , he would hear about one case of cancer a year			2
" now it 's like ... too numerous to even count			2
" the decision to include cancer has added another layer of complexity to the law 's implementation , @entity62 said			1
for one thing , it 's possible that some people will not be diagnosed with cancer until years down the road , creating challenges for determining whether the cancer originated because of work at ground zero			1
more immediately , adding cancer will undoubtedly mean the $ 2.775 billion dollars set aside for compensation will be exhausted before everyone is taken care of , meaning that @entity168 will have to step in to provide additional funds			1
@entity62 is confident that will happen			0
" i would be shocked if the federal government decided somebody was sick from being down there , has been damaged in a certain amount , and then decided that they 're only going to pay a fraction of it , " he said			0
" i mean , it 's pretty obvious that at some point the government 's going to have no choice but to fully fund this for all covered illnesses			1
" @entity0 , now retired from the @entity1 , is grateful his cancer is in remission and a little unsure about whether any money will ever come through			1
" you know , it 's really an unknown , " he said			2
" i 'm not sure what it holds			0
it 's been something they 've been talking about for 10 years now , and it 's always this little carrot dangling			2
" and if the money does come through , @entity0 has no idea how much he could get			1
" i 'm not even thinking about that , " he said			0
" if i can recoup what i lost alone in terms of co-payments and parking garage bills , i will be a happy man			1
" 58 cancers receive 9/11 fund coverage			0

@entity104 set aside funds for those *exposed* to toxins while working at ground zero
a decision on which types of cancer will be covered is expected soon
retired officer @entity0 was diagnosed with @entity23 's lymphoma
he says he *'ll* " be a happy man " if he can recoup co-payments , parking costs
