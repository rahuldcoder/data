-- here 's the next thing the @entity2 needs to rethink			1
what does it say if and when the @entity5 returns to prosperity ? for five years , @entity5 politics have been shaped by economic hardship			2
in 2008 and 2010 , voters rejected the party in power , booting republicans out of the @entity12 , and then sweeping @entity13 out of @entity14			2
@entity15 campaigned in 2012 on the slogan , " @entity17 is n't working			1
" president @entity17 responded by attacking @entity15 as out of touch , assuming ( probably correctly ) that he could not win by running on his record			1
but the indicators are suggesting that by 2013 and 2014 , the @entity17 record will begin to look a lot better , assuming , that is , that the two parties in @entity24 do n't recklessly push the country off the fiscal cliff at the end of the year			1
opinion : how @entity2 can bounce back the nation 's economy added 171,000 jobs in october 2012 , for a total of almost 700,000 in the four months before @entity33			1
more than half the jobs lost in the crash of 2008 - 2009 have now been recovered , even as public - sector employment has shrunk by a net 500,000			2
the economy is recovering because consumers are less burdened by debt			2
they are paying down their credit cards , building home equity and strengthening their personal balance sheets			0
as household debt burdens become lighter , consumers express more confidence			1
they are allowing themselves to spend a little more			0
they are even buying new homes again			0
housing starts in october 2012 rose to a level 41.9 % over a year before			2
accelerating economic activity is rapidly reducing the budget deficit			0
the deficit has contracted since 2009 at the fastest rate since the end of @entity57 , faster even than during the late 1990s boom			0
wages remain flat , and will likely stay flat until unemployment contracts more , but @entity5 can begin to see better times ahead for the first time in a long time			0
news : @entity2 resistance to anti-tax pledge grows as they do glimpse that better future , two things will happen in politics : 1 ) president @entity17 will begin to claim more credit			1
in 2012 , the word " stimulus " went unmentioned by @entity13			0
it was republicans who tried to make political use of the $ 800 billion spent on job creation in 2009 - 2011			0
in 2013 - 2014 , however , the shoe may suddenly rematerialize on the other foot			0
2 ) @entity2 will discover that their old " @entity17 is n't working " theme has become obsolete			1
by 2014 , again assuming that @entity14 does not leap off the fiscal cliff , it will likely look as if @entity17 is working			1
what then ? if negative messaging failed in 2012 , it will fail bigger in 2014			0
for too long , the @entity2 have predicted apocalypse , debt crisis , the loss of freedom , the overthrow of the constitution			1
as the economy improves , that doom - saying will seem even more out of touch than ever			0
@entity2 political chances will depend on the @entity2 ability to devise a positive program to address the country 's fiscal problems in ways that improve people 's lives			1
it 's a new day , guys , and it demands a new game			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity108 .			2

@entity108 says signs pointing to the economy gaining steam in next two years
he says household debt is down , consumer confidence is up , jobs are returning
@entity2 message in 2010 , 2012 was that @entity17 's plan was n't working , he says
@entity122 : @entity2 needs a new message if the @entity17 economy produces real gains
