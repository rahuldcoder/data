-- a @entity2 official ridiculed as " another blatant lie " a @entity5 government report thursday asserting that terrorists -- not security forces -- massacred civilians in @entity9			1
last weekend 's massacre , which left more than 100 people dead , sparked outrage across the globe and prompted calls for action against the regime of @entity17			1
but @entity5 attributed the latest violence to " armed terrorist groups , " the vague entities that the regime has blamed all along for widespread violence against civilians during the nearly 15 months of unrest			1
" the goal of the armed operation was to completely terminate the presence of the state in the area and to make it one that is out of the control of the state , " @entity25 , head of the investigative panel , said in televised remarks			0
" all of the martyrs are from peaceful families who refused to stand against the state and have never demonstrated or carried weapons against the state			0
they were in disagreement with the armed terrorist groups , which confirms that there was a goal and an interest to kill them			0
" the @entity2 ambassador to the @entity49 , @entity50 , called the @entity5 account " another blatant lie " and said there 's no " factual evidence " to " substantiate that rendition of events			1
" she said the @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , could soon embark on an effort to establish facts in the case and hold people accountable			2
@entity2 defense secretary @entity63 said the international community needs to ensure @entity17 steps down			0
" there is no question that we are very concerned about the atrocities that are taking place in @entity5 , " he said			1
" @entity70 makes clear how important it is to remove @entity17 from power and to try to implement the necessary political reforms that are necessary in that country			0
" the @entity5 government investigation said 600 to 800 armed people gathered after friday prayers at two primary locations and committed the crimes			1
@entity25 said firearms shot from a close distance and sharp objects were used , but there was no shelling			2
" the place where the massacre was committed is an area where armed terrorist groups are present , " @entity25 said			2
" the security forces did not enter the area before or after the massacre and the area is far from the checkpoints where the security forces are positioned			0
" but he said security forces " defended themselves against the armed terrorist groups			0
" some of the attackers hailed from the @entity9 area , investigators said			1
" also , some of the bodies that were shown as part of the massacre are bodies of armed individuals who were killed during their attack on the security forces and they are not from the town			0
" politicians across the world , opposition leaders and @entity5 citizens blame the regime , citing witness accounts that pro-government forces were responsible for the @entity9 bloodshed			1
they say government forces have been responsible for violence in @entity5 since march 2011			1
the massacre spurred diplomatic action this week			0
the @entity2 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 announced that they are expelling @entity5 diplomats			1
@entity132 has said the massacre was carried out by @entity135 militias or local gangs acting on behalf of the regime			2
survivors told @entity139 that the army shelled the area and " armed men , dressed in military clothes , attacked homes on the outskirts of town and executed entire families			0
" a network of @entity5 opposition activists , the @entity148 , blamed " armed militias " of the @entity5 government			1
" this barbaric act was preceded by the regime 's mortar shelling in the town , " the @entity148 said in a statement			2
" the campaign ended when the armed militias slaughtered entire families in cold blood			0
" sectarian tensions have been high in @entity9 , which is overwhelmingly @entity162 and is surrounded by @entity164 and @entity165 villages			2
the regime is dominated by @entity164			0
the government report came as @entity2 secretary of state @entity168 ramped up pressure thursday on @entity170 , saying the @entity171 has been an obstacle to peace in @entity5			1
" i think they are , in effect , propping up the regime at a time when we should be working for transition , " @entity174 told reporters in @entity176			0
the @entity2 and @entity170 have been looking for solutions to the 15 months of persistent violence			0
estimates of the number of dead range from 9,000 to more than 14,000			0
the @entity2 is focused on supporting @entity49 and @entity190 envoy @entity189 's six - point peace plan			2
the administration is hoping @entity170 can persuade @entity5 president @entity17 to adhere to the plan and keep the country from deteriorating into more warfare			2
the @entity5 regime said it supported the @entity189 plan , which includes a cease - fire			1
but so far , according to the secretary of state , the @entity5 regime has failed to abide by the initiative			1
" the @entity170 keep telling us they want to do everything they can to avoid a civil war because they believe the violence will be catastrophic " and they have likened the situation to the " equivalent of a very large @entity210 civil war , " @entity174 said			0
" they 're just vociferous in their claim that they are providing a stabilizing influence , " she said			0
" @entity174 urged leaders in @entity5 society and the military to use their influence to avoid a full - blown civil war			2
she said countries like the @entity2 and @entity176 are " appalled " by the violence and want " to win over those who still support the regime inside and outside of @entity5 to see what options are available to us			1
" " we 're also aware that there is still a fear among many elements of the @entity5 society and the @entity5 government , that as bad as the @entity17 regime is , it could get worse , " she said			1
" and we therefore continue to call upon the business leadership , the religious leadership , the military leadership , those voices within the government that know what is going on is leading to the very outcome they fear most -- which is a sectarian civil war -- to stand up now and call a halt to further support for this regime			0
" merchants in @entity252 shut their stores to register their disgust with @entity9 on thursday , echoing the same angry gestures that were made last monday in the historic @entity256 in downtown @entity257			1
" we carry the responsibility for continuing to work while people are dying , " said an @entity252 store - owner who asked to only be named @entity259 , in a phone interview with @entity0			1
" that is our shame , " he said			0
@entity49 @entity266 ban ki - moon referenced the @entity9 incident on thursday in @entity268 , @entity128 , saying " the massacre of civilians of the sort seen last weekend could plunge @entity5 into a catastrophic civil war -- a civil war from which the country would never recover			1
" " i demand that the government of @entity5 act on its commitments under the @entity189 peace plan , " he said			2
" a united international community demands that the @entity5 government act on its responsibilities to its people			1
" @entity121 's @entity49 ambassador , @entity282 , said thursday that he was not prepared to pull the plug on the peace plan			1
" clearly it is on life support but it is n't dead , yet , " he told @entity286 's @entity285			0
" we are directing all our efforts into trying to make it work , " he said			0
" but i think to make it work we 're going to need to increase the international pressure on the @entity5 regime			1
" @entity282 praised the role @entity49 observers played in bringing that incident to light : " to be honest , we would not know exactly what had happened in @entity9 had it not been for the observers able to go there , to demonstrate that there had been tank tracks , that there had been use of heavy artillery , that there had been a massacre by the @entity5 regime , " he said			1
" otherwise , people would give some credence to this report that the @entity5 government has come out with today claiming that it was nothing to do with them			1
we know that 's a tissue of lies partly because the @entity49 observers are able to say so			2
" @entity170 and @entity318 have been more receptive to the @entity5 government during the crisis , and have blocked tough action against the @entity17 regime in the @entity322			1
@entity170 foreign minister @entity324 said this week that " certain countries " were attempting to use the @entity9 massacre as a " pretext " for a military operation against @entity17 's forces , which have been partly armed by @entity170 , @entity170 's @entity323 reported			2
@entity324 also accused the head of the opposition @entity331 of attempting to " incite a civil war			0
" the government also said proposals by @entity337 powers to arm rebels would " prolong the conflict			0
" since the conflict began , the government has blamed the violence against civilians on armed terrorist groups			0
but opposition groups and citizens have blamed the government			0
violence continued in @entity5 thursday , with at least 61 people killed in the country , the @entity148 said			1
@entity5 forces shelled @entity9 again early in the day , and 29 people were killed in @entity352 alone , it said			1
@entity0 can not confirm death tolls or reports of violence from @entity5 because the government limits access to the country by foreign journalists			2
@entity5 opposition fighters issued the government a friday afternoon deadline to cease fire , pull out troops from residential areas and allow humanitarian aid			1
the @entity366 , mainly comprised of military defectors , said it would stop adhering to the @entity189 plan if the government does n't begin to adhere to it by then			0
" our national , moral and humanitarian duty make it necessary for us to defend and protect our civilians and their cities , towns , blood and dignity , " the group said in a statement			0
the ultimatum lists a series of demands in a peace plan implemented last month and brokered by @entity189			0
" immediately halting gunfire and all violence , pulling out all the troops , tanks and machinery from residential areas , allowing humanitarian aid to reach all stricken areas , releasing all prisoners and allowing media access , " said col. @entity384 , the group 's spokesman			0
@entity384 also called for the freedom to demonstrate , an end to attacks on @entity49 monitors and a dialogue on power handover			2
meanwhile , @entity5 authorities freed 500 prisoners arrested for their alleged involvement in the uprising , state tv reported thursday			1
@entity0 's @entity407 , @entity408 , @entity409 , @entity410 , @entity411 , and @entity412 contributed to this report .			0
