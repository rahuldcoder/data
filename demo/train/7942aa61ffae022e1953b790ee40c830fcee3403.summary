it is the highest price paid for a piece of @entity5 memorabilia , with the sale at @entity15 's over in a matter of minutes with the bids leaping £ 50,000 ( $ 80,000 ) at a time			1
the previous record was for an @entity5 torch from the @entity21 in @entity22 which fetched $ 400,000 last year			1
@entity23 became a national hero when he won the only gold medal for @entity3 in the track and field events 116 years ago so it became a matter of national pride that the cup should return to the birthplace of the @entity5			1
@entity0 understands that the mayor of the @entity32 in @entity6 , where @entity33 was born , raised 350,000 euros ( $ 458,000 ) to bid			2
the new owner is the @entity3 philanthropic organization , the @entity35 , named after the late @entity3 shipping tycoon			2
the cup will go on display in @entity6 and will eventually be given a permanent home in the @entity35 's new cultural center due to open in 2015			1
symbolic value the cup which fetched such a vast sum is just 15 centimeters high but beautifully decorated in the art nouveau style			0
its intrinsic value -- as silver -- is n't very high			0
but this cup is all about symbolism , an object from the beginning of the modern @entity5			1
the story of the cup involved three men			0
@entity23 , his grandson and a @entity52 , @entity53			2
@entity33 had helped salvage @entity3 pride in the most emblematic of races for the host country			2
the odds were certainly stacked in their favor			0
of the 17 runners , 13 were @entity3			2
but going into the last few miles of the race , an @entity61 and a @entity52 athlete were leading and an expectant crowd waiting in the stadium were subdued			0
then suddenly word reached the stadium that the foreigners had both dropped out and a @entity3 was leading			2
@entity23 was n't considered a favorite and had only finished fifth in a special trial race before the @entity71 , but he proved to have stamina			1
by trade , he moved water by mule into the center of @entity6 and it stood him in good stead			2
@entity3 hero by winning the marathon ( then 25 miles ) he instantly became a @entity3 sporting immortal			1
even now in @entity3 , over 70 years after his death , his name remains a synonym for moving at speed			2
the 2004 @entity85 is named after him			0
@entity86 of @entity3 presided over the award ceremony on the last day of the @entity71			1
@entity23 received a silver medal , a crown of olive leaves , a diploma and , of course , the special silver cup			1
and this is where @entity53 enters the story			0
he was a distinguished linguist ( usually credited as the founder of modern semantics ) and passionate about all things @entity3			1
he was crucial in persuading his fellow @entity52 , @entity100 to include the marathon in the first games			0
as an incentive , @entity53 provided the special cup for the winner , @entity107 's @entity106 as it became known			1
it is unclear who designed it , but the relief decoration shows bird and plant life from the ancient battleground of @entity116			0
so the legend has it , in 490 b.c. , the messenger , @entity119 ran from @entity116 to @entity6 to bring news of the @entity3 victory over the @entity123 , then collapsed and died			1
until now , the cup has always been in the @entity33 family			0
during the @entity127 , it was apparently hidden in a tomato patch in a garden , but more recently it has had pride of place on the mantelpiece in the house of the great athlete 's grandson , also called @entity23 , a retired civil servant in his early 70s			1
reluctant sale he agonized for some time , but in these tough economic times in @entity3 , he reluctantly decided to sell it , to provide for his two children			1
two years ago , he did the rounds of various government ministries , offering to sell the cup for a mere 100,000 euros ( $ 130,000 ) but without response			0
the @entity145 did n't seem to have any reservations about granting it an export license and this has ultimately proved to the financial benefit of the @entity33 family			0
@entity53 's great grand daughter , @entity151 , aged 88 , attended the @entity15 's sale			1
and just before it started , wearing white gloves , she was able to briefly hold the legendary @entity106 her great grandfather commissioned			0
it was a touching moment ; she had never even seen the cup before			0
@entity151 has a mission ; the @entity106 may be going back to @entity3 for museum display , but @entity53 's tombstone in @entity161 in @entity162 badly needs restoration			1
apparently the authorities are threatening to demolish it			0
there 's evidently a big crack down the middle and $ 6000 is needed			0
mrs @entity151 is hoping that the newly - enriched @entity23 may able to help .			0
