@entity1 , @entity2 a federal judge gave a four - year prison sentence friday to a 19 - year - old @entity2 woman who admitted guilt in wanting to become an @entity8 bride and participate in its jihad in the @entity11			1
@entity12 is one of the first @entity13 to be sentenced for conspiracy to support @entity8 and received a sentence that was also recommended by prosecutors seeking to send a message of deterrence			1
though the judge initially cited how @entity12 needs psychiatric care , he sided with prosecutors in the end			1
" what is it that will cause others to stop " in the future , judge @entity23 said during sentencing			1
before sentencing , @entity12 wept as she read a statement saying , " it was after arrest that i learned the truth about the @entity8 that i was taught to respect			1
" she talked about her ongoing journey into @entity35			2
" since my incarceration i have had a chance to read the entire @entity38 , " she said			2
she concluded that " the scholars " she had been following in her online research about @entity35 had distorted the @entity38 , she said			0
" even though i was committed to the idea of jihad , i did n't want to hurt anyone			2
it was all about defending @entity45 , " she said			0

later her parents released a statement online criticizing the @entity13 legal system for making an example of their daughter in trying to discourage others from turning to extremism			0
if " the government is willing to sacrifice the future of a 19 - year - old @entity13 citizen to drive the point home ... then we feel the terrorists have won this particular battle in the war on terrorism			2
" outside the courthouse after the proceeding , @entity12 's lawyer , assistant federal defender @entity75 , told reporters he was disappointed with the sentence and noted that the plea agreement imposed limitations on any appeal , which the defense is considering			1
" i think the judge gave a sentence he thought was appropriate			1
that 's all i really have to say about the sentence , " @entity75 said			2
he said he wanted @entity13 to know that his client is a wonderful person			0
" her future will be bright			0
she will get past this , " he said			0
but @entity23 said @entity12 's plea agreement gave him limited options on sentencing			1
under the plea agreement , @entity12 faced " up to five years in federal prison and a fine up to $ 250,000 for conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization , " federal prosecutors said			1
she received credit for cooperating with federal authorities , according to the prosecutor and the judge			2
her prison sentence will be followed by three years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service , in which she has to interact with " ordinary people , " @entity23 said			1
he also prohibited her possession of any black powder or explosive materials			0
" i 'm not taking any chances , " @entity23 said			0
@entity12 's plea was made last year in exchange for a reduced charge with a lighter sentence			1
during friday 's sentencing hearing , @entity13 attorney @entity121 said @entity12 has been cooperative and willingly provided information to investigators			1
he argued that a four - year sentence would send a message that the @entity13 government uses restraint , but consequences are serious in terror cases			2
@entity23 interrupted the prosecutor at one point saying , " that woman is in need of psychiatric help			0
" " i 'm not saying that her decisions were all a product of mental illness			0
... but she 's a bit of a mess , " @entity23 said			0
the judge referenced @entity12 's psychiatric report that stated " she is not a terrorist			1
" the judge also alluded to a series of events from 2011 to her arrest in 2014			2
" there is a history of events that would make for a bad movie , " @entity23 said			0
@entity12 almost agreed to marry three different people in a matter of months , according to @entity23			1
the prosecutor said @entity12 was " pathologically naive			1
" added the judge : " she has no history in the criminal justice system			2
... teenagers make dumb decisions a lot			0
" @entity12 looked relaxed in court			1
she smiled at times while talking with lawyers before the hearing			0
she wore a blue and white jail uniform , a head scarf and glasses			0
@entity75 said while @entity12 has been in jail , she has been studying @entity169 and macroeconomics , writing letters to her mother , sisters , friends , even " @entity175 , " talking about religion and her desire " to understand			1
" her lawyer said she has gone through a complete transformation in the past nine months			0
@entity75 argued that " the things that she believed at the time she was arrested she does not believe now			0
" he noted that @entity12 , a convert to @entity35 , changed her adopted @entity45 name from @entity182 to @entity183 , because she is a different person now			1
@entity184 means female " servant of @entity175			0
" @entity12 initially took the name @entity187 after converting to @entity35			1
opinion : when @entity13 leave for jihad but @entity23 adamantly responded , " she had another name before @entity187			2
" " do n't tell me that changing her name means she gets it			0
she changes her name like i change my socks , " the judge told the defense			2
the judge said a belief , even if she was misled by ill - intentioned extremists asserting religion justifies violent jihad , does not excuse her actions			1
" there is a string of defiance that rolls through her life that i have not seen change yet , " @entity23 said			0
" @entity210 has been a part of the fabric for a long time and that is concerning			0
" the judge talked about how she showed up to a meeting with the @entity217 wearing a t - shirt that said , " sniper do n't run , you 'll die trying			2
" the judge also mentioned how investigators tried to stop @entity12 with multiple warnings that following through on her plans could lead to her arrest			1
she responded with , " i 'd rather go to prison than do nothing , " according to @entity23			2
the judge also expressed alarm about @entity12 's other preoccupations			1
" what am i to do about this obsession with the military ? " @entity23 said			0
opinion : rise of the female jihadists he said @entity12 planned to be a police officer and join the military and then went to training with @entity239 to learn military skills			1
what if one reason she desired to go to @entity243 to marry an @entity8 fighter was n't just because she shared a belief in jihad , but " because he was attractive to her because he was a soldier ? " the judge asked			1
the judge noted that @entity12 still signs letters " behind enemy lines			1
" a female imam went to mentor @entity12 in jail and reported that @entity12 wanted to talk about violent jihad			1
the judge said it 's surprising that @entity12 suddenly is disavowing jihad and that she has seemed to do a 180 - degree turn in a very short period			1
the judge also brought up a letter @entity12 wrote to a friend that seemed to mock the @entity13 people 's concern about terrorism			1
@entity23 also referenced comments that @entity12 made to @entity3 when it visited her a day before friday 's sentencing			1
@entity12 told @entity3 of her new adopted @entity45 name , a new hairstyle for the sentencing date , and how " i 'm in a vulnerable place right now , and it would be stupid of me to talk to you when i 'm vulnerable			1
