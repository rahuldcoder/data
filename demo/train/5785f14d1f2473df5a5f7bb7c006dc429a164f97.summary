@entity0 -- in a series of floor speeches thursday , a group of mostly @entity4 women senators made a high - profile and at times emotional appeal to @entity9 to support an expanded @entity10 ( @entity10 )			1
in doing so , they suggested @entity9 were blocking the bill because it would extend its protections to illegal immigrants as well as gays and lesbians			0
many @entity9 were furious at that suggestion and accused @entity4 of election - year politics by trying to paint @entity9 as anti-women			1
" let me put this on the table , " said sen. @entity19 , @entity20			2
" this bill includes lesbians and gay men			0
the bill includes undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse			0
the bill gives native american tribes authority to prosecute crimes			0
in my view these are improvements			0
domestic violence is domestic violence			0
" sen. @entity36 of @entity37 , the lone @entity9 to join in the floor speeches , said domestic violence victims in her state are often isolated in rural communities " where there is no law enforcement and there is no shelter and there is nowhere to go , " she said			0
" the @entity10 is , i think , a ray of hope for those who service victims of domestic violence and sexual assault within our villages			2
" " nobody opposes the reauthorization of this legislation , " @entity57 of @entity58 , the second - ranking @entity59 @entity9 , told @entity1			1
" if you follow the @entity66 work on it , the questions had to do with the additions that have been made to this bill related to illegal immigrant visas , related to the additional sums of money and grants that would be available and the like			0
" so what @entity9 are focusing on is how to make a bill that should be reauthorized functional in this day and age of significant budget constraints so we can still accomplish the goals of the legislation , " @entity57 continued			1
" i really resent the implication by some of my @entity4 friends that if you 're trying to improve the bill that somehow you are for violence against women			2
" asked whether the provisions about undocumented immigrants and gays and lesbians needed to be pulled from the bill , @entity57 said : " i do n't know			1
reasonable people ought to be able to sit down and work these things out			0
" sen. @entity95 , @entity96 , accused reporters of " carrying @entity99 's water , " when they asked him whether he opposed the bill because it would include illegal immigrants and gays and lesbians			1
sen. @entity99 of @entity104 is the @entity4 ' top message strategist in the @entity59			1
@entity9 think it was his idea to suddenly put @entity10 on the floor , just after high - profile battles over other women 's issues -- like abortion and contraception -- were in the news			1
" i 'm always for the @entity117 bill , " said sessions who voted for a @entity9 alternative bill that was defeated in the @entity4 - majority @entity66			1
but he said every time @entity10 is up for reauthorization , " if you do n't agree with everything that 's in it , they just attack you as being anti-women			1
" sessions added that he was not aware until thursday the @entity4 bill extended to lesbian , gays and illegal immigrants but he acknowledged voters could misread @entity9 ' views on the bill			2
" i think we should be sensitive to the impressions we cast by our votes and so forth but fundamentally you ca n't vote a piece of legislation you do n't think is sound , " @entity95 said			1
one bit of evidence that @entity4 were , in fact , trying to use the issue for their political advantage was a fundraising appeal e-mailed to supporters by the @entity145			2
" today we 're seeing another stunning @entity9 attack on women 's rights , " exclaimed the appeal which asked for donations of $ 5 or more for the committee 's " @entity148			0
" in an interview with @entity1 's @entity153 wednesday about the recent fight over contraceptives , @entity36 warned her party is in danger of angering women voters			0
" i think my party is in an unfortunate place right now , as viewed by many , many women in this country who are feeling anxious about what they believe to be attacks on women 's health , " she said .			0
