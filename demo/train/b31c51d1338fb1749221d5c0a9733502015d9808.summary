@entity1 finally , something went right for the @entity3 in the @entity4			2
relief is palpable in @entity1 over the well - planned and seamlessly executed transfer of @entity8 's throne to @entity9 , 79 , following the death of his 90 - year - old half brother @entity11			1
the kingdom , despite signaling rare public dissent with the @entity14 administration over @entity15 and the @entity16 , is a fulcrum of @entity3 diplomacy in a region where @entity1 is struggling to adapt to dissolving national borders , chaotic change and sectarian carnage			1
never mind that the @entity3 is the world 's foremost democracy and the transfer of power in @entity8 was from one autocrat to the next			1
@entity8 is crucial to @entity3 goals on counter-terrorism , the campaign against @entity32 and @entity33 , the free flow of energy that sustains the global economy , as a counter-balance to @entity15 and as a sponsor of the long frustrated quest for peace between @entity41 and the @entity42			1
in a sign of the kingdom 's importance to the @entity3 , president @entity14 made hurried plans to call in @entity8 on tuesday after his trip to @entity48 to pay his respects to @entity11 and his family and to meet with @entity9			1
originally , vice president @entity51 was to have made the trip			0
the message from @entity1 is clearly : long live the new king			0
the regal choreography in @entity56 is especially welcome to the @entity57 as it contrasts with events just across the border in @entity60 , another key ally where a @entity3 - backed government crucial to its anti-terror campaign has just been toppled to rebels supported by @entity15			1
@entity64 , who served as @entity3 ambassador to @entity8 between 2009 and 2013 , said there should be no concern in the administration that @entity9 's ascension will jeopardize @entity3 relations with the deeply conservative kingdom			1
lines of succession " we know @entity9 well , he was governor of @entity56 for the better part of 50 years , he is well known to the @entity3 government			1
i see no break in the @entity3 - @entity8 relationship , " @entity64 said			1
@entity9 vowed just hours after the death of @entity11 , that the kingdom " would continue adhering to the correct policies which @entity8 has followed since its establishment			1
" @entity87 spokeswoman @entity86 said that the allies had a " long history of cooperation			0
we do n't have any indication that that cooperation will change			0
" @entity8 watchers in @entity1 were impressed and reassured by the line of succession outlined by @entity9 in an apparent effort to solve a dynastic riddle and send a signal of continuity to the outside world			2
he named prince @entity103 , one of scores of posssible candidates , as deputy crown prince , a move which puts him second in line to the throne and establishes a future transfer of power from the sons of the founder of @entity8 , @entity113 , who have ruled the country since the 1950s , to a new generation			0
" i think for the near term , continuity is going to be the centerpiece here , " said @entity116 , a former coordinator for counter-terrorism at the @entity87 , now at @entity118 , told @entity2			0
" there is now a member of the generation of the grandchildren who is second in line , he is a very close friend of the @entity3 ... so i think there is a lot of hope the relationship will stay on an even keel			0
" prince @entity103 , now behind the @entity11 's brother @entity134 , 69 , in the line of succession , is a frequent visitor to the @entity3 and has presided over @entity8 's anti-terrorism program			1
he narrowly escaped an assassination bid by @entity33 in 2009			0
the succession plan was viewed as particularly important following unconfirmed reports that @entity9 has been in ill health himself , apparently having suffered a stroke			1
@entity143 , pointman for @entity3 relations with @entity8 when he was @entity14 's national security advisor , praised @entity11 as a " solid " ally who had ensured two decades of stability in the kingdom			1
he also said that the late @entity11 's survivors had done a " pretty effective job of indicating stability with a quick annoncement with repect to succession , continuity of policy			1
" he told " @entity164 " with @entity2 's @entity156 that @entity157 , known as @entity158 in the @entity3 was " a very , very competent person who is essential in terms of our joint efforts to combat terrorists			2
" periods of tension though there is relief at the apparent stability in @entity56 , relations between the @entity3 and @entity8 in recent years have have often been troubled			1
there was a tense period a decade ago , after it emerged that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the september 11 attacks originated from @entity8			0
critics , including some in the @entity3 government , faulted @entity8 for backing jihadists movements throughout the region for geopolitical reasons			1
the @entity8 government has also balked at @entity3 criticisms of its human rights record and political system			2
questions about @entity15 more recently , @entity8 , the key @entity185 power in the @entity4 , has not hesitated to make clear its concern about @entity14 's quest to improve relations with its mighty @entity190 foe @entity15 , with which it is fighting various proxy struggles			1
@entity8 leaders were dismayed to learn about a secret backchannel of talks between the administration and @entity15 which built on the election of " moderate " @entity15 president @entity197 in 2013 to launch an effort at rapprochment between @entity199 and @entity1			2
' " i think that the concern remains among the @entity8 leadership about an agreement that is going to be at their expense , " said @entity200 , an author on @entity8 and senior scholar at the @entity202			0
some analysts believe that the @entity8 government could react to what it would see as a bad nuclear deal between world powers and @entity15 -- which left the @entity212 with some capacity to enrich uranium or produce plutonium -- by looking to find its own nuclear capability -- perhaps with assistance from @entity218			2
@entity8 princes took to the op - ed pages of @entity3 newspapers in 2013 in a highly unusual move to complain that a nuclear deal was a " dangerous gamble			1
" the @entity8 government also made clear its deep anger with @entity14 's last - minute decision not to launch planned air strikes on @entity228 to punish the @entity231 regime 's use of chemical weapons the same year			2
@entity8 has also been frustrated at how long it has taken the @entity3 to begin training opposition fighters in @entity228			2
anger at @entity14 comments on the @entity16 the @entity8 government also registered anger at the @entity14 administration 's embrace of @entity16 uprisings , which led to the ouster of allies like @entity242 president @entity241			2
@entity14 appeared to make an oblique reference to those differences in a statement honoring @entity11 on thursday as a " steadfast and passionate " believer in @entity3 - @entity8 relations as a force for stability			1
" as a leader , he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions , " @entity14 wrote			0
in recent years , the @entity14 administration has attempted to assuage @entity8 fears			0
the @entity3 president made a visit to @entity56 last year , on a trip that was widely seen as an attempt to mend fences			2
@entity8 pilots , reportedly including one of @entity9 's sons , prince @entity264 , helped carry out the first air attacks on @entity32 in @entity228 last year			0
@entity8 also approved of secretary of state @entity267 's exhaustive but ultimately futile efforts to keep @entity41 and the @entity42 talking			0
and @entity57 spokesman @entity268 said that an underpinning of those efforts , an @entity269 framed by @entity11 would stand as his lasting memorial			0
@entity64 said that the relationship between @entity56 and @entity1 was now better than it had been earlier in the administration			0
" a key element of our relationship with the @entity8 over the years has been transparency , not always in public but we have done a good job in talking to each other , " he said			0
" when you leave your allies out of the conversation and they do n't understand your negotiating position or do n't understand how you are going to enforce an agreement			0
they are left to their own conclusions			0
" i think we are doing a lot better at that			0
