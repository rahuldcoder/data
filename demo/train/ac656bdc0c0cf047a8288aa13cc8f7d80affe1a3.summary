-- @entity1 and @entity2 were still mourning the death of their 17 - year - old son , @entity4 , when two months after his funeral , they received shocking news from students of the same @entity10 , @entity11 , high school @entity4 had attended			1
members of a forensic science club on a field trip to the morgue could n't believe what they noticed on a cabinet in the medical examiner 's lab. " they saw this jar with a brain in it labeled @entity26 , " recalls @entity2 , whose daughter @entity21 came home in tears that day delivering the news			1
" they knew @entity4 and he knew them			0
they were looking at his brain , and his brain was looking right back at them , " the father adds			1
@entity26 died in a car accident in january 2005 , and the family members say that even though they agreed to an autopsy , they thought they were burying their son with all of his organs			1
to them , the cause of death was obvious - blunt trauma resulting from a car accident - so there was no reason for authorities to have kept the brain for further review			1
the couple are now suing the city for the emotional distress caused by the handling of their son 's remains			1
" as far as we understand , during an autopsy you cut open the body , you look for the cause of death , you check out the organs and you put them back in			1
in this case , it was a little more than that , " @entity61 says			0
in a statement to @entity0 , the attorney representing the city wrote that although officials sympathize with the family , " it was within the @entity70 's discretion to perform an autopsy , and in appropriate cases , to remove and retain bodily organs for further testing			1
" dr. @entity77 , a forensic pathologist and a spokesperson for the @entity79 , says determining cause of death is not as simple as people think			0
he says it is common practice for medical examiners in the @entity86 to save the brain and certain other organs when they think it 's important			1
" to say someone died of a motor vehicle accident , does n't really tell us anything , " @entity77 explains			0
" for example , if a passenger in the backseat was epileptic , their fit could have distracted the driver and led to the death			0
so , from the outside it may not be so obvious why the person actually died			0
" @entity77 says the brain is preserved for at least two weeks in a formula that firms the matter enough for the coroner to examine it , a process necessary to rule out suspicion and to maintain evidence for cases when the death is determined to be the result of criminal activity			1
he says the deceased is often buried within that time period			1
" we have a certain authority to investigate death for public health and public safety reasons			0
that is a right pitted against the individual right , and sometimes that does upset families , " he explains			0
others , such as @entity127 medical ethicist @entity126 , disagree			0
he says most people recognize the duty of medical examiners to rule out crime , but that does not justify keeping organs			2
" the state says we 're going to take this body and examine it to see what might have happened , but we promise you , we 'll give everything back , " @entity126 says			0
" when you do n't do that , you 're breaking a basic covenant with society and with families			0
" the @entity143 provides a sample autopsy consent form on its website			0
according to the form , the consenter authorizes " the removal , examination , and retention of organs ...			1
as the pathologists deem proper for diagnostic , education , quality improvement and research purposes			1
" however , the form also states that " organs and tissues not needed for diagnostic , education , quality improvement , or research purposes will be sent to the funeral home or disposed of appropriately			2
" according to @entity126 , the laws are clear about what a medical examiner should do , but there is little oversight in the industry			0
he says in situations where an autopsy has been performed and a bereaved family is concerned whether all the remains have been returned , it is usually up to the family to ask			2
court documents from the @entity2 case indicate that medical examiners have extensive , but not unlimited , discretionary authority			1
the trial court " found that questions of fact existed with regard to whether @entity4 's brain had been lawfully retained for scientific purposes , and whether the defendants unlawfully interfered ... by failing to advise [ the family ] at the time the body was released for burial that the brain had been removed and retained			1
" but , @entity77 says approaching the family with this information is an area where even some medical examiners disagree			2
" some forensic pathologists would say going to the family and asking , ' can i keep this ? ' would further upset them at a time of grieving , " he explains			1
" but , there are others who say we really should be asking the family every time			2
" still , @entity77 says , in some circumstances it is not beneficial to ask family , because the person of you ask permission could potentially be connected to the cause of death			2
" it 's all about trust , " says @entity208 , author of the book , " @entity212 , " which explores the history of tissue research in the @entity86			2
in her opinion , cases such as the @entity216 ' contribute to a growing mistrust in the medical system			0
" people worry things are being done to them without their knowledge , and so they do n't trust doctors , " @entity208 explains			0
" it does n't matter if you take it out and put on your shelf or send it off to do research , it 's still taking something without people 's knowledge			2
" perhaps what 's most extraordinary in the @entity26 case is that the family did find out through the serendipitous field trip students from @entity4 's high school took the morgue			1
dr. @entity239 , a forensic pathologist and attorney who reviews cases like these but is not involved in the @entity2 case , says the medical examiner was right to take out the brain for investigation but was wrong to openly display @entity2 's name on it			1
" you 're talking about a matter of sensitivity and common sense , " @entity239 says			0
" certainly if you 're going to have student visitors , then you should not have names and numbers available to see			0
" the @entity216 ' attorney , @entity255 , says not only the brain , but parts of the liver and testes were later returned and buried in a small casket with their son 's body			1
he says handling the remains was the most traumatizing aspect for the family			2
" for them , whenever they remember their child , part of their memory is holding a jar of organs in their hands that they never should have known existed , " he explains			2
he is hoping for a settlement during their october 27 court date			0
" i feel bad for those people who found out in the past and even worse for those who never will , " @entity61 says			0
" we buried our son , and then two months after we had chunks of him coming back to us			1
this is not the way it 's supposed to be			0
" @entity0 's @entity291 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 and @entity2 found out that their son 's brain was not buried along with him
a class from @entity26 's high school saw his labeled organ at the morgue
the family is suing the city for emotional distress
legally , the removal of organs is allowed as pathologists deem proper for diagnosis
