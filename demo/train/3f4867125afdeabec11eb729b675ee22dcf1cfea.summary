-- with the sweltering summer bidding adieu and pleasant autumn temperatures setting in , now 's the time to explore @entity4			1
travelers to the @entity7 capital may hesitate to try the city 's famed street foods , fearing the notorious " @entity10			1
" but skip the street food scene and you miss an essential part of the @entity4 experience			1
here are seven street delicacies among @entity4 's endless choices , including a mix of vegetarian , non-veg and dessert			1
@entity22 laddoo desperate for an energy boost after a tiring shopping session ? a plate of ram laddoo is your fix			0
@entity22 laddoo ( " laddoo " is a name for sweet flour balls ) are savory , deep - fried moong balls served with chili - coriander sauce and garnished with grated radish			0
served in silver - colored , throwaway plastic bowls , one serving of six - to - seven balls is a great power snack or even lunch			0
best to try it at the make - shift ram laddoo stalls , sometimes on a bicycle , that are strewn across town			0
if you are n't lucky enough to see one , try it at @entity50 main market			2
@entity51 sitting under a tiny tin - roofed shop in and downing deep - fried potato patties floating in a blend of yogurt , spicy green and red sauces served in leaf bowls is a definitive @entity4 experience that even hardcore locals ca n't get enough of			1
@entity51 is a collective term used to describe savory street dishes in @entity62 , especially these three : aloo tikki ( described in the gallery above ) , dahi bhalla ( cutlets of skinless black lentil - like gram submerged in yogurt ) and papri chaat ( a hybrid of aloo tikki and dahi bhalla with salty , plain biscuits thrown in )			1
many @entity4 chaat addicts flock to a narrow alley behind the @entity76 's office near @entity77 ( @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity4 , @entity62 )			1
@entity82 's ( @entity81 , @entity83 , @entity77 , @entity4 ; open daily 11 a.m. -9 p.m. ) range of chaat options do the trick for a satisfying dinner			1
@entity88 located in a remote corner in old @entity4 's @entity93 area , @entity89 ( @entity90 ) is home to some of @entity4 's best - known parantha joints			1
the chapati 's stouter , fancier cousin , parantha is a pan-fried flatbread generally stuffed with vegetables , such as mashed potato , grated cauliflower and radish			0
it 's a popular breakfast item in @entity4 's @entity108 households			1
@entity89 offers innovative parantha options			0
as you plonk down in one of the @entity89 's tiny , crammed restaurants , you 'll find a number of delicious offerings : @entity7 rabri ( sweet yogurt ) parantha , mirch ( red pepper ) parantha , and lemon parantha ( prepared from lemon zest , and probably the best this street has to offer )			2
samosa samosa is chaat 's close competitor for the title of " @entity130 street food " title			1
( if there was such a thing			0
) it is to @entity62 , perhaps , what momo dumplings are to @entity135 and bagels are to certain parts of the @entity138			0
as most people know , samosas are deep - fried , triangular pastry pockets , packed with potato , peas , lentils and sometimes meat			0
although they 're often served as an appetizer at @entity7 restaurants around the world , they can be paired with chaat for a full meal			2

kebabs traveling to @entity4 and not trying the kebabs ? not done			2
a legacy left behind by the @entity163 , who invaded @entity62 in the 16th century , the grilled meats served on skewers make the best on - the - go protein meals			0
you can typically choose among mutton or chicken kebabs			0
the @entity93 and @entity170 areas house some of the best kebab outlets in @entity4			2
if you are n't up for the large crowds in these bustling locations , you can take refuge in the more accessible @entity177 's corner in @entity178 ( 8 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity4 ; +91 11 2602 0563 ; open daily 7 - 11 p.m. )			1
@entity181 no snack this , chola bhatura is for people with huge appetites			0
@entity189 , plain , flour bread combined with a chickpea curry , garnished with chopped onion and served with a tangy mango pickle , chola bhatura is a @entity4 meal staple			2
it works both as a lunch and dinner item			0
@entity196 in @entity50 is arguably the best chola bhatura area in @entity4			2
but if you find yourself in @entity199 or @entity200 , you could hop into any of the numerous chola bhatura shops			0
@entity203 kulfi after consuming mouth - burning delicacies it 's kulfi time			0
@entity207 is @entity62 's local ice cream , made with milk and a smattering of dried fruits			1
there are 57 varieties in all			0
the queen of them all is faluda kulfi ( faluda is a popular rose milk flavor dessert drink with vermicelli noodles )			1
the trusted @entity207 in @entity220 serves kulfi with the heavenly faluda , a beverage consisting of rose milk and vermicelli .			1
