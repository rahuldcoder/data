-- the ideal of childhood , and the protection of its innocence , is a central pillar of both our morality and our legal code			1
there is , therefore , little that shocks and outrages us more than crimes by adults against children			2
unfortunately , we have much to be shocked and outraged about			0
there have , for example , been a number of recent pedophile criminal cases inside the @entity20 and at universities like @entity22			1
and in the @entity26 , the crimes against children by the warlord @entity25 triggered kony 2012 -- an online crusade made up of mostly children against @entity25 's abuse of children			0
what is @entity33 ? the last couple of weeks have brought us two more disturbingly high - profile criminal cases against children			1
first there was the failed attempt by the medieval @entity40 @entity39 to kill the 14 - year - old education activist and @entity43 blogger @entity42			1
and now there are the lurid accusations against the @entity43 celebrity @entity46 , who is alleged to have sexually abused children			0
these grotesque crimes may have been separated by several decades and by thousands of miles , but they have one thing in common			0
both the @entity40 @entity39 and @entity46 sought to destroy the innocence of youth			1
@entity46 is accused of treating children as if they had adult bodies and sexual appetites , while the @entity39 attempt to murder @entity42 was driven by their rejection of the idea of education for girls and thus , in a sense , of the very idea of childhood itself			1
but @entity42 , who is now recovering from the assassination attempt at an @entity68 hospital , shares our modern conception of childhood			1
" i have the right of education , " she told @entity0			0
" i have the right to play			0
i have the right to sing			0
i have the right to talk			0
i have the right to go to market			0
i have the right to speak up			0
" what @entity42 is claiming is the right to an autonomous childhood , the right to transform herself from an innocent child to a knowing adult -- and to be let alone by the adult world in this journey			1
this right is mirrored by the experience of @entity46 's alleged victims , whose innocent childhoods were ruined by their exposure to his criminal adult appetites			0
a @entity39 spokesman said of the attack on @entity42 : " she has become a symbol of western culture in the area			1
she was openly propagating it			0
let this be a lesson			0
" the @entity39 , with their rejection of the very idea of childhood , are of course wrong			1
but the @entity42 case does indeed offer us a " lesson			2
" yes , we should all be horrified by this appalling crime against a 14 - year - old @entity40 girl from the @entity113 , but i fear that , in our idealization of childhood and in our acute sensitivity to the innocence of brave young girls like @entity42 , we are ourselves vulnerable to transforming children into celebrity martyrs -- modern day versions of @entity123			1
this happened with @entity33 , a movement akin , as i wrote earlier this year , to a children 's crusade			0
and @entity42 , who was nominated for the 2011 @entity126 , is herself in danger of becoming a symbol of injustice exploited by everyone from @entity131 to @entity132 and @entity0 itself			2
so how did this happen ? unfortunately , @entity42 was allowed , by her family , by many @entity40 and by the media to become a spokesman against the @entity39			1
the well - meaning @entity43 is partially to blame here , for giving her a highly visible blog that would inevitably attract @entity39 ire			1
@entity42 's equally well - meaning father holds some responsibility too , for allowing his daughter to become so vulnerable -- as does the world 's media for transforming the teenager into a global celebrity			1
our ideal of childhood is rooted in allowing children to being let alone by the adult world to develop themselves			1
we need adults to fight their political battles -- to have prosecuted @entity46 , to hunt down @entity25 , to fight the @entity40 @entity39			2
let 's remember that children are , in every sense , innocent and thus should n't be encouraged to become the foot soldiers in the battle against their own exploitation			0
the story of @entity42 should be seen as both an inspiration and a warning			2
@entity0 is currently encouraging its readers to send messages to @entity42			2
my message to her is twofold			0
firstly , i dearly hope that you recover quickly from your wounds			0
and secondly , once you recover , i hope you 'll be able to go back to the privacy of your childhood , to simply being @entity42 rather than a global celebrity whose image is owned by other people			1
( the @entity43 addressed its connection with @entity42 on its blog called the editors , and you can read it by following the link here )			2
