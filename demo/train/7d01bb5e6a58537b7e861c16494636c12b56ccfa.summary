was it the ultimate adventure or an audacious act of disrespect that should be punished by law ? an internet sensation was touched off this week by @entity7 photographer @entity6 and a group of his friends -- the group ignored regulations prohibiting the public from climbing on the @entity13 at @entity14 , @entity15 , and came away with spectacular photos			1
the images from @entity6 and another photographer , @entity18 , were taken on top of the @entity13 from positions that avoided detection by guards			1
the photos have incited reactions ranging from envy and awe to indignation and concern for the preservation of the ancient wonders			2
in an email to @entity31 , @entity6 now explains his reasons for flouting the regulations , and issues an apology to @entity15 and the world			1
@entity6 's email to @entity31 " i 've always been drawn to @entity15			1
for as long as i can remember my dream was to get to the top of the @entity39 of @entity14			1
" when my friends and i arrived in @entity42 the first thing we decided to do was to go and see the pyramids			2
we got there in the evening , just in time to witness the laser show			2
" no words can express the fascination i felt when seeing my childhood dream come alive			2
probably this very feeling made us climb onto the top of the @entity13 and see the the panorama of the whole complex , the desert and @entity42 itself			1
" it was already pitch black and nobody paid us any attention			2
we started climbing as fast and as soundless as we could			2
you have to be quite strong and agile to climb onto a meter - high block covered with dust			0
" it was exhausting , but the thought that we were going to witness something spectacular pushed us forward			0
" it took us around 20 minutes to get to the top			1
we were taken breathless by the view			0
" what we saw from up there was the seventh wonder of the world			0
we tried to capture the beauty of the scenery in the photos , so that the others could also see this magnificent panorama			0
" we , of course , were not the first who dared to climb the pyramid			1
" the pyramid 's peak was filled with different inscriptions in many languages , some of them being hundreds years old			1
" after enjoying the view for some time we started the descent			0
it turned out to be harder then climbing up			0
we were very lucky not to get [ caught ]			0
we would have been in serious trouble if we did			0
" that 's why i would like to apologize for this ascension			1
we did n't want to insult anyone			0
we were just following the dream			0
