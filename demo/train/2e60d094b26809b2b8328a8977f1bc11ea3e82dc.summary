-- why was it that , while others in your class were happy to study law or go into finance , you wanted to be a popstar ? or maybe you were the rebel : an unruly and disruptive influence the teachers disliked			2
that said , you could have been the procrastinator -- somehow never getting started -- or the dreamy idler living in an invented parallel universe			2
their commonality ? all are signs you are a high - @entity18 : someone with a high fear of failure as i call them in " what 's stopping you ? " my book on understanding , accepting and navigating the insecurities that drive career failure			1
fear of failure was first uncovered in the 1960s by psychologists such as @entity33			1
working at @entity34 , @entity33 conducted a series of experiments on children -- setting them reward - based tasks in order to test their motivation			2
he noticed they divided into two camps : those focused on winning the reward , who approached the task with what he called a " need for achievement , " and those focused on their seemingly inevitable failure , who had what @entity33 termed a " fear of failure " based on their desire to avoid the public humiliation of failure			1
see also : is happiness the secret of success ? in one experiment the children played a game of hoop - the - peg , with greater rewards offered for greater distances			2
the " need for achievement " kids stood a challenging but realistic distance from the peg -- adding concentration if they failed			2
those with fear of failure , meanwhile , stood either right on top of the peg or so far back that failure was almost certain			1
of course , those choosing the impossible distance effectively disguised their fear of failure , not least because everyone failed at such a distance			1
yet that was the better response			2
many of the fear of failure kids became disruptive -- intonating that they did n't care for the game with some even trying to halt the entire process			1
@entity96 ( an @entity97 psychologist ) undertook similar experiments and came to similar conclusions , although also found he could manipulate the response by telling the children the task was " very difficult			2
" this encouraged the @entity18 kids to continue -- the humiliation of failure having been lowered			1
and 1970s experiments by @entity107 and @entity108 concluded that children were either " mastery oriented , " meaning they were focused on acquiring new skills ( and were unconcerned by temporary setbacks ) , or " ego oriented , " which meant their main concern was to not lose face			2
the impact of fear of failure from here , it 's easy to see how such a divide can impact our career progression : indeed , our entire lives			1
high - ffs keep their ambitions either low or -- as a mask for their insecurities -- extraordinarily high ( knowing that failing to become a tv star will be kindly judged )			1
it 's the challenging but achievable career choices ( such as joining the professions ) that are avoided by @entity124			2
see also : ambition could make you rich , but not happy so is there a way out ? not from our fears			1
mainstream psychologists deride those -- such as hypnotists and acupuncturists -- that claim they can instantly cure our fears and phobias , stating they simply inject alien personality traits into us			1
these will eventually be revealed as such , producing an inevitable reckoning			2
yet we can learn to accept our fears as part of us , and then navigate their destructive consequences			1
to do this , however , we need a plan			2
so here are my seven steps to overcoming ( but not curing ) fear of failure			1
if those popstar goals are a mask you 'll need to go back to square one and calculate what really motivates you			1
this requires you to establish the values and principles that underline your existence			0
it 's these that should drive your goal setting , not your insecurities			1
with your values written down , visualise yourself 10 - years ' hence			0
every detail should be imagined : house , car , partner , office , dog ( or cat )			0
importantly , also focus on the details of your career			0
what will you do day - to - day , where and with whom ? then ensure it dovetails with your values -- otherwise it will almost certainly fail			0
the 10 - year horizon is long - enough to make anything possible : including professional exams			1
yet you have to ensure the path you take is the right one			0
so visualize yourself in five years ' time			0
what has to be in place to ensure the 10 - year goals are achievable ? then do the same for two years -- thinking about the needs for the five - year horizon			0
then three months , one month and one week			0
and what can you do tomorrow to make sure the one - week goal is conquered ? 4			1
develop a strategy and tactics			0
of course , goals fail without strong execution , while " busyness " can lead us in the wrong direction			0
we need a strategy -- a plan that ensures our actions lead us towards our objectives			0
so undertake a @entity215 analysis : looking at your strengths , weaknesses , opportunities , threats			0
this should help a strategy emerge because we can execute tactics on our strengths while developing skills to overcome our weaknesses			0
meanwhile , we can pursue the opportunities ( if goal - focused ) and plan to navigate the threats			0
according to @entity230 , all activities fall into four boxes : urgent and important , urgent and unimportant , not urgent and important , and not urgent and unimportant			0
we spend our time on urgent - box activities neglecting the not - urgent - and - important box that is vital for achieving our long - term goals			0
yet if we start here , our activities become driven by our goals allowing us to control urgent - and - unimportant activities ( otherwise called interruptions ) and potentially reframing our not - urgent - and - unimportant activities as refreshing moments where we can enjoy our progress			0
for high - ffs , other people are a problem			1
too often , we become reactive and defensive , or potentially manipulated by people leveraging off our insecurities			1
yet dealing with difficult people is possible once we have " developed our compassion " -- i.e. we 've stopped seeing the world from our own perspective and , instead , seen it from theirs			1
if done genuinely , we can then forge win - win strategies that turn potential enemies and barriers to our progress into allies that can help us achieve our goals			0
still struggling ? just maybe you have n't found your unique gift			0
everyone has a special talent or insight that they should first discover and then offer to others			0
mine was a curiosity regarding my condition ( as a @entity18 ) and a background in writing			0
i combined the two to write " what 's stopping you ? " what 's yours ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity280 .			1
