@entity0 -- @entity4 's smaller religious groups have been facing " ongoing severe abuses , " and the situation requires a response from the @entity7 , a religious freedom watchdog said tuesday			1
in late november , members of a @entity11 @entity4 family sit in a home in @entity13 after fleeing violence in @entity15			2
the @entity16 issued a report citing " threats and intimidation " against @entity20 and other @entity21 , @entity23 - @entity22 and @entity24			0
the commission wants the @entity26 to designate @entity4 as a " country of particular concern " -- a status that would allow policy responses , including public condemnations , the denial of state visits , and even sanctions			2
spokeswoman @entity35 said such a designation would draw attention to the abuses and " encourage a robust policy response			0
" there has been " reconciliation " between @entity4 's dominant @entity46 and @entity47 religious groups , but tensions continue to reverberate and that 's a concern , the commission said			1
but the smaller groups do n't have " militia or tribal structures to protect them " and they " do not receive adequate official protection			1
" " @entity4 's @entity54 religious minorities -- particularly @entity21 , mandaeans and @entity24 -- have suffered religiously - based attacks and other abuses , and have fled the country , at rates far disproportionate to their numbers , seriously threatening these communities ' continued existence in @entity4 , " the report said			1
" lacking militias , and in the case of the @entity22 unable to defend themselves for religious reasons , they are easy prey for extremists and criminals , and they do not receive adequate protection from the authorities			1
as in earlier years , they also are caught in the middle of a @entity76 - @entity75 struggle for control of disputed northern areas where the minorities are concentrated and have been targeted because of this			0
" examples include @entity11 protest over provincial election legislation and anti-christian violence in @entity15 this autumn and election intimidation of non-muslims in @entity86 in 2005			0
the @entity92 also " gives @entity87 a preferred status , providing a potential justification for abuses and discrimination against @entity54			0
" the commission is recommending that the incoming @entity95 administration ensure " safe and fair provincial elections " and " security and safety for all @entity4			1
" it calls for making prevention of religious abuse a " high priority " and urging the @entity76 region to support " minority rights			2
" it also urges addressing the displaced persons ' and refugee problem			0
