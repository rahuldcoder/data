@entity1 lawmakers launched a furious , multipronged barrage of questions wednesday at @entity4 , who resigned as the head of @entity6 a day earlier , but @entity4 steadfastly defended himself and the bank			1
@entity4 refused to be drawn into whether he would give up millions of dollars ' worth of bonuses , and he insisted the scandal that forced him to quit was due to a small number of " reprehensible " traders at @entity6			1

it 's been dealt with , " he insisted			2

@entity6 chairman resigns amid rate - fixing scandal he insisted wednesday at a parliamentary hearing that history would judge the bank as " an incredible institution			1
" but lawmaker @entity28 , herself a former @entity6 banker , accused diamond of living in a parallel universe , saying the culture of @entity6 was the problem , not the solution			2
and @entity35 , another member of the @entity36 , attacked his line of defense			0
" you just keep saying , ' i did n't know , i did n't know , ' " about wrongdoing at his bank , she said			2

@entity1 and @entity63 regulators fined @entity6 more than $ 450 million last week for rate - fixing during the height of the global financial crisis			1
the scandal centers on the rates at which banks lend each other money			1
the rate is hammered out based on input from big banks in @entity73 each morning and is known as the @entity73 interbank offered rate , or @entity76			2
it affects how much interest ordinary people pay on everything from credit card debt to home mortgages and student loans			0
the fine came after @entity6 admitted some of its trading desks purposely underreported its interest rates			1
former investment banker @entity88 said the scandal has caused such fury because of its impact on the public			0

" this was wrong and i 'm not happy about it , but we put all the resources we could to make sure it was dealt with			0
... this does n't represent the @entity6 that i know and i love			2
" he blamed the wrongdoing on 14 traders out of " a couple thousand			0
" @entity4 was pressed hard about communications between his bank , politicians and the @entity112 regarding his bank 's views on what the rate should be			1
@entity6 published internal e-mails ahead of wednesday 's hearing suggesting that politicians were asking the @entity112 to put pressure on banks to keep interest rates low			1
lawmakers demanded to know who @entity4 meant when he said " @entity127 " was concerned about @entity6 ' views on @entity76 , which is set each day by a group of banks			1
@entity127 is a catch - all term for the @entity1 government			0
he refused to name names and gave inconsistent answers about whether he thought the pressure was coming from elected politicians or career civil servants			0
the answer , if it ever emerges , could have political implications for the @entity139 , which was in power at the time			0
before the hearing , one of the lawmakers on the @entity36 said @entity4 was making a serious accusation			2
" he has made allegations about the behavior of a very highly respected and trustworthy deputy governor of the @entity112 , @entity149 , and many of us will want to get to the truth of that , " @entity148 said			0
the allegation " goes to the very heart of the integrity and probity of regulators in the @entity158			0
one of those is the @entity112 , " he said			0

" his own pay package remains " under discussion , " @entity6 told @entity174 on wednesday			2
@entity4 's total compensation package for 2011 was worth £ 6.3 million ( $ 9.8 million ) , including salary , bonuses and share options , the bank said			1
the annual bonus consisted of £ 2.7 million ( $ 4.2 million ) in shares and was deferred over three years , the bank said			1
the chairman of the @entity189 , @entity1 's banking regulator , last month blasted the " cynical greed of traders asking their colleagues to falsify their @entity76 submissions so that they could make bigger profits			0
" chairman @entity195 said the scandal " has caused a huge blow to the reputation of the banking industry " and " has justifiably shocked and angered people			0
" at least seven other banks are under investigation on suspicion of rate - fixing , leading to speculation that @entity4 could be the first of many executives to resign			1
libor e-mails : ' for you ... anything ' financial regulators in @entity73 have not named the banks , but @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 have acknowledged that they are under investigation			0
