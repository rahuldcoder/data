-- after days of insisting no formal complaints had been made about a teen gang calling themselves the " @entity6 , " @entity2 police now admit a 13 - year - old girl made a rape allegation two years ago			1
the girl , now 15 , told @entity10 on wednesday that police officers asked her to re-enact the alleged rape using dolls during a videotaped interview in 2011			1
" it was traumatizing , " she said			0
the teenager repeated claims she said she 'd made to police that she 'd been raped by three boys from the " @entity6 , " a gang of teenagers whose online boasts about raping drunk underage girls caused outrage when they were exposed by local media this week			1
for days , police said they were powerless to arrest the boys because none of their alleged victims had filed a formal statement			1
however , on wednesday , they admitted the girl had made a formal complaint just weeks after the alleged attack			1
" an investigation was launched and the complaint was thoroughly investigated , " police said			0
" whilst this was a distressing situation for the girl and her family , police determined that there was not sufficient evidence to bring a prosecution			1
" @entity44 commander superintendent @entity43 told @entity10 on thursday the decision not to prosecute the girl 's alleged attackers would be reviewed in coming days			2
he also said he 'd be investigating why he was n't told a formal complaint existed , adding there was a " little bit of disagreement " over what constituted a complaint			2
" i was briefed there was no formal complaint			0
as far as i 'm concerned what the lady said was a formal complaint			0
i 'd like to apologize to her for any stress that this would have caused , " he told 3 news			2
opinion : do n't blame women 's drinking for rape he said he 'd also be investigating the girl 's claims she was asked a " lot of questions " about what she was wearing at the time of the attack			1
she said officers asked " why did you go out in this skirt ? " " it 's not part of our policy , it 's not part of our general practice to ask these sorts of questions , " @entity43 said			0
the country 's police minister @entity87 has asked the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) to investigate the matter , particularly officers ' questioning of the then 13 - year - old alleged rape victim			1
" parents of young girls need to have confidence that complaints to police about sexual assault are investigated thoroughly and appropriately , " she said in a statement			1
referring to the apparent confusion over whether a formal complaint had ever been filed , she said she was " disappointed " the full facts had not been divulged to her or the country 's police commissioner			2
" i do n't expect to be told finer details of police operations			0
police must remain independent of politicians			0
but i do expect police to be talking to each other , " she said			0
in a statement on thursday , police commissioner @entity112 welcomed the independent review and said @entity116 police remained " absolutely committed " to pursuing the matter			2
" prosecuting these matters before the court requires a very high threshold , and we only get one opportunity to get it right			0
this means it absolutely critical for victims that we have the strongest case possible , backed by the appropriate evidence before we can proceed			0
" earlier this week , @entity43 told @entity0 they had been actively monitoring the group since the first alleged offense was committed in 2011			2
he said police interviewed two boys identified as the group 's ringleaders again on monday , but they had n't admitted to anything that constitutes a criminal offense			1
" the online claims themselves are not enough to warrant a prosecution , " @entity43 said			0
" they might be morally inappropriate and unacceptable to us but we have to deal with evidence that would be admissible in a court of law and we have n't got to that stage yet			0
" @entity43 declined to confirm how many boys were involved in " @entity6 , " but said the two ringleaders led a " core group , " as well as " an associated group			1
" the boys were attending at least two different schools at the time the alleged offenses were committed but all have since graduated , he said			1
it 's believed they 're now around 17 to 18 years old			0
in a video posted to @entity157 , two boys made no attempt to hide their faces as they told the camera : " we do n't choose the roast , the roast chooses us ... they know what we 're like ; they know what they 're in for			1
" they boasted of their exploits on a number of social media sites , including @entity172 and @entity173 , as well as a @entity175 page which has since been shut down			0
@entity43 said on tuesday the boys had recently received death threats but had not requested police protection .			2
