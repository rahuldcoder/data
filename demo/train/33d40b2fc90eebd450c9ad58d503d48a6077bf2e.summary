-- a same - sex ceremony between an enlisted woman and a civilian woman on a @entity5 post last month drew protests from lawmakers thursday			1
the " private religious ceremony " took place at @entity9 in @entity10 in may , post spokesman @entity11 said , but he would confirm few other details			0
rep. @entity14 , a @entity10 @entity15 whose congressional district includes the @entity5 post , said the military confirmed to him that the same - sex ceremony was performed by an @entity5 chaplain in the chapel			1

" the liberal social experiment with our military continues , " @entity14 said			1
" a same - sex marriage - like ceremony should not have occurred at @entity9 , especially since the people of @entity10 have made it abundantly clear that our state does not recognize same - sex marriages or civil unions			2
" rep. @entity37 , a @entity39 @entity15 whose office said has been working " to protect traditional marriage on military bases , " said the ceremony was " clearly in contravention of state law and also violates the @entity45 policies issued last fall			0
" " it is very concerning that a same - sex ceremony would occur on a military base in a state where the definition of marriage has been clearly defined as between one man and one woman , " @entity37 said			1
military personnel can reserve post facilities for private events such as weddings or other ceremonies , @entity54 spokesman @entity53 said			2
