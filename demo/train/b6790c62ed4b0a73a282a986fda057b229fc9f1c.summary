-- a bill that requires cruise ships to tighten security measures and report alleged crimes is awaiting president @entity6 's approval			1
the @entity7 on wednesday passed the @entity8 and @entity9 , after it received broad bipartisan support in the @entity11 with a vote of 416 - 4 last year			1
@entity13 on cabin doors , rails no lower than 42 inches and information packets on how to report crimes are some of the changes commercial cruise passengers can expect to see after the legislation takes effect			1
ships built after the legislation 's passage also must be equipped with security latched and time - sensitive key technology			2
the bill , authored by rep. @entity27 , @entity28 , and sen. @entity29 , @entity30 , applies to all ships that dock in @entity34 ports			1
those ships will also be required to immediately report incidents to the @entity37 or the @entity38 , whether the incident occurs on the high seas or at port			1
" current law does n't pass the test of providing common - sense security measures to the traveling public or to help protect them from crimes committed aboard ships , " @entity27 said in a statement wednesday			0
" moreover , current law does not provide the support victims and their families need in the event of a disaster			0
this legislation is critical to providing the security and safety measures that all @entity34 need and deserve			1
" the legislation originated with a letter from one of @entity27 's constituents , who said she was raped during a @entity62 cruise by a crew member in february 2006			2
@entity64 , who has gone public with her story before @entity66 , claims representatives of the cruise line made her collect sheets and clothing from her room and put them in a plastic bag			0
they did nothing more to help her , she said , and the @entity37 later told her that it would not investigate further because without proper evidence , it was simply a " he said / she said " case , according to her testimonial on the @entity79			2
since then , a number of high - profile alleged assaults , disappearances and homicides have helped earn support for the legislation , @entity27 spokeswoman @entity80 said			0
last year , a @entity88 - area man was charged in july with murder in the death of his wife while on a cruise along the @entity94 coast , and an @entity96 woman celebrating her 50th birthday disappeared from a @entity99 cruise ship			2
among the provisions in the bill related to sexual assaults : ships are required to carry rape kits and a supply of medications to prevent @entity107 , along with medical staff trained to deal with assaults			1
the legislation also requires cruise ships to provide passengers with free , confidential access to 24 - hour sexual assault hot lines			1
vessels also must keep a log of incidents and contact the nearest @entity37 field office " as soon as possible " after a homicide , kidnapping , assault or disappearance of a @entity34 national is reported			1
" safety protections in this bill will significantly reduce passengers ' risk of sexual assault and expand the rights of those sexually assaulted on board , " said @entity125 , president and founder of the @entity127			0
" by connecting cruise passengers with the support services available through the @entity127 and @entity138 , this legislation provides a vital lifeline for victims on cruise ships			1
" @entity27 's office worked with the cruise ship industry in crafting the legislation , spokeswoman @entity142 said			1
" having a law that 's not going to be carried through would n't make sense , so we 've worked with them to make very common - sense requirements that they can put in place , " she said			0
many of the requirements have already been implemented by the cruise ship industry , which has been working for years to improve passenger safety , said @entity157 , editor and co-publisher of the trade publication @entity160			2
" this basically means that procedures that they have been implementing for the last several years have been formalized , " he said			0
" the industry supports it because it 's in its best interest that procedures are set down , so in case something happens , everybody knows what to do and there are no gray areas			0
" @entity157 said negative backlash against the industry generated by the disappearances of newlyweds and young revelers is undeserved at times , considering that anywhere from 12 million to 15 million people board commercial cruises each year			0
" if you look at the total numbers , relatively few people are lost at sea			0
in the big picture , the numbers are small			0
but we understand that when you lose a loved one , there 's not enough the industry can do to prevent it from happening again			0
