president @entity1 's historic move to loosen the @entity3 embargo on @entity4 set off an immediate clash with @entity6 keen to use the dramatic foreign policy shift to further their own @entity9 aspirations			1
the announcement immediately threw two @entity12 politicians -- sen. @entity13 and former governor @entity14 -- into the spotlight and served as another reminder of the state 's enduring importance in presidential politics			1
@entity13 , the son of @entity4 immigrants , quickly took a hardline position , vowing to block any nominee the administration might put forward to be an ambassador to @entity4			1
he called @entity1 's announcement " truly outrageous and counterproductive " because there has been no " democratic opening " in @entity4			1
" it is a lifeline for the @entity31 regime that will allow them to become more profitable ... and allow them to become a more permanent fixture , " he said on @entity28			0
" the embargo is leverage , these sanctions are leverage			0
" @entity13 continued : " we have just lost a significant part of our leverage ... not a single democratic concession			2
" in a subsequent press conference , @entity13 expanded his critique into a direct attack on @entity1 's foreign policy , previewing the assault @entity6 hawks could adopt in the presidential race			1
" this president has proven today that his foreign policy is more than just naive , " @entity13 said			2
" it is willfully ignorant of the way the world truly works			0
" @entity13 called @entity1 " the single worst negotiator we have had in the @entity9 in my lifetime			1
" @entity14 , who shocked the political world on tuesday by announcing he would explore a @entity9 bid , welcomed the release of @entity3 contractor @entity61 but said it was too early to transform @entity4 policy			1
" he should n't have been in prison to start with			0
he did n't do anything to deserve it			0
but the fact that he 's coming home is spectacular news for himself and his family â€” on the first day of @entity74 , " @entity14 said when asked about the @entity4 news at a holiday event with @entity12 governor @entity73			1
in his first major foreign policy comments of the nascent 2016 campaign , @entity14 then warned in a statement that only @entity78 and @entity31 , who between them have ruled @entity4 for over half a century , would benefit from @entity1 's " ill - advised move			1
" " @entity4 is a dictatorship with a disastrous human rights record , and now president @entity1 has rewarded those dictators			1
we should instead be fostering efforts that will truly lead to the fair , legitimate democracy that will ultimately prevail in @entity4 , " @entity14 said in a statement posted on his @entity87 page			1
@entity14 's consistent hard line towards @entity92 could be appealing to thousands of @entity93 in @entity12			2
but there 's also the question of whether the issue will be as potent in 2016 as it has been in previous election cycles , as the younger generation of @entity93 , many of them born in the @entity3 , are not as steeped in the @entity102 - era struggle as their parents			0
@entity14 has been a strong supporter of the trade embargo and believes it should only be lifted once political prisoners are freed , @entity4 fully embraces democracy and a market economy is established			1
" instead of lifting the embargo , we should consider strengthening it again to put pressure on the @entity4 regime , " @entity14 said at a meeting of the @entity110 earlier this month			1
meanwhile , @entity118 @entity117 sen. @entity116 , whose father fled @entity4 , expressed " rejoice " that @entity61 is back in the @entity3 but he slammed @entity1 for easing restrictions on @entity4			1
" make no mistake , although we are glad @entity61 is now free , the agreement the @entity125 has entered into with the @entity31 regime has done nothing to resolve the underlying problem , " he said in a statement			0
" indeed , it has made it worse			0
" @entity6 sen. @entity131 , who is also considering a presidential run , tweeted " this is an incredibly bad idea			0
" the @entity117 positions set up a clear contrast with a possible 2016 @entity137 election rival @entity136 , who expressed support for @entity1 's moves in a statement released wednesday night			2
" i support president @entity1 's decision to change course on @entity4 policy , while keeping the focus on our principal objective -- supporting the aspirations of the @entity4 people for freedom , " she said			2
" it is great news that @entity61 is finally home with his family , where he belongs			0
" the former secretary of state ran for the @entity9 in 2008 opposing calls to lift the embargo , but she has since shifted her stance			0
in an interview with @entity163 television network earlier this year , @entity160 argued that the embargo had " propped up " the @entity31 regime			2
" i would like to see us move toward normalizing relations eventually and therefore more @entity3 ( allowed to move ) back and forth , " she said			0
" that 's something president @entity1 did and i supported in the first term			2
" @entity160 wrote in her book " @entity172 " that towards the end of her time in the @entity1 administration , she " recommended to president @entity1 that he take another look at our embargo			1
" " it was n't achieving its goals and it was holding back our broader agenda across @entity182 , " she wrote meanwhile , @entity1 's announcement surprised many on @entity185			0
outgoing @entity187 chairman @entity186 , who has often crossed swords with @entity1 on @entity189 and @entity4 policy , issued a statement that hinted at the tough fight to come over the embargo in @entity194			1
watch : @entity31 thanks @entity1 , pope while hailing a " moment of profound relief " for @entity61 , @entity186 blasted @entity1 , who he said had " vindicated the brutal behavior of the @entity4 government			2
" " trading mr @entity61 for three convicted criminals sets and extremely dangerous precedent , " said @entity186			0
" it invites dictatorial and rogue regimes to use @entity3 serving overseas as bargaining chips , " he said and argued that the " asymmetrical trade " will invite further belligerence from the government towards the @entity4 opposition			0
house speaker @entity208 also hammered @entity1 's foreign policy , rebuking the president for " another in a long line of mindless concessions to a dictatorship that brutalizes its people and schemes with our enemies			0
" @entity117 sen. @entity219 , who will take control of the foreign relations panel next year , said lawmakers " will be closely examining the implications of these major policy changes in the next @entity194			0

@entity1 move opens 2016 row over @entity4
