-- if you 've been mesmerized by the drama , like millions of other viewers watching coverage of the @entity5 , you have heard the most heroic , inspirational stories of athletes reaching the pinnacle of international competition			1
or , at least you think you have			0
the truth is @entity12 viewers are missing out on the best of the @entity5			1
coverage of the @entity5 in the @entity12 understandably focuses on @entity12 athletes			1
that is as it should be , but not to this degree			0
by concentrating mainly on @entity12 ' stories , the @entity20 network is depriving @entity12 viewers of some of the most fascinating , moving and exciting aspects of the @entity5			1
how much have you heard , for example , about @entity27 , who marched in the opening ceremony under the banner of " @entity30 " ? @entity27 became a marathoner after running for his life since he was a young boy in @entity33 , growing up in the middle of one of the deadliest wars of the 20th century			2
he learned to run as he fought to escape from those who killed his siblings and relatives and later kidnapped and enslaved him			0
imagine such a story of tragedy and redemption , from slavery to triumph			0
his life is a most unbelievable odyssey , culminating at the @entity5			2
his parents live in a village with no electricity or running water			0
he has n't spoken to them in years and hopes someone will get word to them to try to get to a television to watch their son			0
it 's fine to cheer for the @entity12 , but how about a cheer for @entity59 ? there 's one who deserves to become a star -- and one who should have @entity20 's cameras following him			1
his is not the only fascinating story at these games			0
@entity12 viewers are interested in the performances of @entity12 competitors			2
there 's nothing wrong with that , and there 's nothing wrong with @entity20 producers offering profiles , even fawning ones , of the hometown athletes			1
but the @entity12 public is missing out on what truly makes the @entity5 special			1
the only time network viewers hear about other athletes , it seems , is when there are suspicions of doping or other violations , which could potentially help @entity12			1
it would seem the rest of the world is there only to serve as the rivals @entity12 require to conquer the podium			1
no question , the @entity12 has brilliant , talented , exciting competitors ; everyone wants to see them			2
but in hundreds of hours of coverage , there should be room in the spotlight , time in the schedule , for the rest of the world			1
in @entity20 's telling , it 's all about @entity104 and @entity105 , about @entity12 gymnasts and swimmers , and soon enough about @entity12 track stars and , ultimately , about crowning the few who will grace the @entity111 box , who will sell us subway sandwiches and @entity115 , @entity117 sneakers and @entity119 chocolate bars			1
it 's about manufacturing heroes because , in a truth we all know , too much of it is about making money			0
behind the cynicism and the commercialism , however , the games really do have the power to inspire			0
there truly is a history of toil and drama behind every athlete			0
that 's because the @entity5 are full of heroes , but they 're hardly all @entity12			1
( although a remarkable number of them do make their home in the @entity12			1
) every athlete has a story , and there are almost 15,000 athletes at @entity144			2
in addition to the rivalries at the pool and the very touching images of @entity12 athletes ' parents suffering and celebrating in the stands , we would all gain from hearing more about , say , @entity154 , the lone woman in the @entity156 delegation , who endured threats and taunts to keep her out of the @entity5			1
because some people in some countries , including hers , are convinced that sports are no place for women			0
in @entity156 , people have been killed for helping girls learn to read and write			2
@entity154 deserves a gold medal just for making it to the @entity5			2
criticism of @entity20 's @entity12 - centric coverage of the @entity5 is nothing new			1
overly nationalistic narratives and neglect of non-americans are chronic problems , which attract attention every time the @entity5 roll around			1
from the veteran sports writer @entity178 to everyday viewers , many complain			0
as one blogger says , " watching the @entity5 in the @entity12 is no fun because the only thing you can watch is @entity12 winning			1
" @entity12 viewers , i have no doubt , would cherish the opportunity to learn more about the first women to compete for @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 , who represent a country where women are not only banned from participating in sports , they 're even banned from watching sports events in major stadiums			2
the @entity5 would have given @entity20 an unparalleled chance to receive permission for a glimpse into the secretive @entity201			1
we could have learned about the mysteries of training in the @entity205 for the two @entity201 medal - winning weightlifters , @entity208 and @entity209			0
learning about how many hundreds of hours @entity105 spent at the pool , or how many pairs of shoes he has in his collection is fine			2
but just think what more we could be discovering			0
does it have to be this way ? is @entity20 just doing what viewers want ? i do n't think so			2
i believe @entity12 would relish the opportunity to find out about many other fascinating individuals competing at the @entity5			1
during my days at @entity0 , politics caused the @entity12 and the @entity223 to boycott each others ' olympics			0
@entity0 founder @entity226 , my former boss , decided to create his own @entity5 , staging the @entity227 over a span of 16 years			0
@entity0 producers and camera crews traveled the world to produce profiles of the men and women who would participate in @entity226 's most excellent sports adventure			0
@entity12 may be missing out on some of the best of the @entity5			1
fortunately , the rest of the world is not			0
as @entity156 's @entity154 said , " there are a lot of @entity156 girls and women [ who are ] watching me and they hope that one day they shall be [ in my place ]			0
and i am going to open a new way for the women of @entity156			0
" one day , perhaps , @entity12 , too , will have the opportunity to gain inspiration from athletes like her , whose journey deserves more attention , even if she does not compete for the @entity12			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			0

@entity257 : @entity5 coverage in the @entity12 understandably focuses on @entity12 athletes
@entity261 : but fascinating stories , like the @entity33 runner who had been a slave , are missed
she says @entity12 wo n't see the @entity156 athlete who endured threats to keep her home
@entity261 : in hundreds of hours of coverage , @entity20 should find time for the rest of the world .
