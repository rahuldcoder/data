-- valuable insight into our health is lurking beneath our city streets			1
" we can reveal the invisible in a city			1
the underworld we do n't see every day , " says architect @entity7			1
the underworld @entity7 is referring to is our sewers -- home to the most personalized waste a city has to offer			1
as director of the @entity17 at @entity18 , his " @entity15 " project is using this waste to open up a new world of information on human health and behavior through a platform he calls " @entity25			1
" " new techniques in biology allow us to characterize bacteria and viruses leaving our bodies			2
[ this is ] the microbiome of us , " explains @entity7			2
his team is currently designing prototype smart platforms that collect sewage , filter it and use computational techniques to analyze any genetic material present to identify any viruses and bacteria , as well as spotting specific chemicals using a technique known as mass spectrometry			1
@entity7 aims to characterize a city 's microbiome ( the vast community of microbes that lives in the human body ) and ultimately " see epidemics before they happen			1
" detecting infections the main benefits lie in the real - time aspect of the technology , providing insight into the diseases circulating in a community before the people affected know for themselves			1
" the steps involved in disease diagnosis are slow , " @entity7 explains			0
first , people need to notice symptoms of illness , and then they have to begin the process of doctors ' appointments and tests to get a diagnosis			0
testing sewage could be a faster way to predict the presence of infections among the population			1
to begin with , the project will primarily look for influenza and gastroenteritis - related outbreaks , such as salmonella and rotavirus infections , but the potential public health benefits go beyond outbreak prediction and surveillance			1
" most of what 's going in and out of a city is the water going in and sewage coming out , " says @entity80 , professor of @entity81 and @entity82 at @entity18 , who runs the @entity15 project alongside @entity7			1
" the change in water in and out reflects a broad array of human activity going on in a city , " he adds			1
but @entity80 admits there are many challenges ahead and that it 's not as straightforward as getting dna from the sewage and sequencing it			1
" it 's only useful if we can figure out what kind of sewage water it is , " he says			1
the water in our sewers is a mix of water from showers , toilets and rain , and the resulting chemicals and microorganisms will vary depending on the source			2
" the second challenge is , who has contributed to that water ? " explains @entity115 but he believes his team can build a robust platform to not only monitor changes in health , but also see what chemicals are being released into the water by industries , as well as monitor chemical security threats and even assess the impact of health policies by looking at other biological factors			0
" there 's a whole host of applications we can use , " says @entity115 live trials the first city to trial their prototype will be the one local to @entity18 -- @entity138			2
this will be piloted in 2016 , ready for a bigger prototype set to be implemented in @entity141 the following year , where the team has formed a partnership with @entity146 stakeholders including its @entity147			0
trials are essential to understand the true sensitivity of such a technology and the extent to which microorganisms such as viruses can be detected			0
" it 's a clever idea in principle , " says @entity154 , professor of @entity155 at the @entity156			0
but he remains unsure whether the bacteria and viruses being targeted can be easily found			0
" some organisms are more fragile than others and will die in the sewers , some are difficult to detect in small numbers and some are more numerous than others , " he says			0
@entity154 recalls a cholera study that took swabs of sewage from manholes in @entity171 , @entity172 , but failed to find a single one these bacteria			2
" it has potential but will take a lot of trial and error to find which results are reliable or meaningful , " he adds			0
the concerns are shared by the team at @entity18			0
" we need to figure out how far down from somebody 's home or business you can still see organisms , " explains @entity80 , who also suggests they may need to time sampling to " peak poop hours " during the day , such as the morning			2
but they have had some success			0
" we did some early studies last year and detected some flu viruses , which we were very excited about			0
" their sewage success was indeed exciting as the types of organisms expected to be found are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract , such as salmonella , whereas flu viruses are respiratory			2
" i 'm optimistic , " says @entity115 smart toilet whilst the short - term plan is to use this technology platform to collect information about entire populations , in the future it could become more personalized , via a smart toilet			2
" we will be able to monitor the microbiome individually , and tell you about your body , " says @entity7 about the overall vision for the technology , " to monitor and detect this before you fall sick			0
" @entity80 monitored his own microbiome for a year back in 2009 , which involved noting every food item consumed and analyzing his every bowel movement			0
but the arduous task provided detailed insight into the microbial communities living inside his body and the impact any changes in travel , diet or health had on their composition			0
the smart toilets are likely to begin simple , with a device to drop into a toilet rather than a toilet you buy outright with technology installed			1
but the information provided could add to the growing field of personalized medicine and healthcare			0
the immediate future , however , remains the glamorous task of mining sewage to visualize urban health patterns			2
" sewage is the most logical start point , " concludes @entity80 about his goals to find the bugs infecting a city			1
" you never know until you go out and find it			0

" @entity15 " project will analyze sewage to spot diseases
monitoring city sewage could reveal infections circulating in the population
the project could one day be applied to *create* individual " smart toilets "
