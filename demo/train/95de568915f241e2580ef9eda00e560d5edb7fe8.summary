-- presidential historian @entity1 says that even though a lot of modern debates are programmed , there are still moments that no one expected			1
" and it 's sort of like championship boxing , " she says , " you do get revelations of character , of temperament , of humor , of anger , and you get a feeling of this person during these one - on - one debates that really nothing else can provide			1
" @entity20 describes 10 key presidential and vice presidential debates that made a difference : 1960 -- @entity24 vs. @entity25 : first tv debate just having @entity24 on the same stage as an experienced vice president made a difference for @entity24 because he could hold his own with @entity25			1
but then , of course , when it was listened to on the radio , it made it seem like it was pretty equal , and even some people giving an edge to @entity25			1
but he looked so terrible			0
he was n't feeling well			0
he looked sallow , he looked scornful			2
and people just reacted to that image of a vigorous , young @entity24 , and an almost sick - looking @entity25			1
and from then on , somehow @entity24 became a figure			2
@entity41 : 10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate 1976 -- @entity45 vs. @entity46 : no @entity48 domination of @entity49 ? @entity46 had done well in the first debate , but in the second debate he was asked a question about @entity48 domination of @entity49			1
and he answered it incomprehensibly			0
there was already a perception , a vulnerability , that he was n't intelligent			0
and then this thing just got parodied , just got talked about , and became a huge event			0
when ordinary people watched that debate , they did n't feel the @entity46 had screwed up			2
but when it was pointed out , that he did n't understand what was happening in the @entity67 in @entity49 , then suddenly they had shifted their minds , and he seemed much worse than it had seemed at that moment			0
1980 -- @entity72 : ' there you go again ' in 1980 , @entity45 was primed to go after @entity72 about his record , especially on @entity76			1
he was going on the offensive : ' you did this ! you voted this way ! you said that ! ' and @entity72 , just with humor and subtlety , said , ' there you go again			1
' and it somehow relaxed @entity72 and it took the offensive away from @entity45			1
it was a brilliant answer to a really serious critique of @entity72 's past that might have been troubling for him			1
1980 -- @entity72 : ' are you better off now than you were four years ago ? ' there was no more brilliant closing than @entity72 's ' are you better off now than you were four years ago ? ' what it did was to make people think , ' yes			1
that 's what 's happened to me			2
my economic life , my family life , my working life , has been hurt by the economy over these last four years			0
' and once they realized that , it almost gave a poster to the entire campaign			0
it was n't just a great moment in the debate , it became a theme encapsulated in just a few sentences			2
and in the end saying , ' if you are better off , then you vote for mr. @entity45			2
if you 're not , you do have another choice			0
me , ' and at the same time , @entity45 gave a very weak closing statement			2
opinion : when candidates said ' no ' to debates 1984 -- @entity117 vs. @entity72 : ' i will not exploit ... my opponent 's youth and inexperience ' in the first debate between @entity72 and @entity117 , @entity72 had appeared old			1
he was the oldest candidate in history at that time			0
he seemed confused by some of the questions , his answers had wandered , and the issue of age really became a large question among the press			0
so when he comes back in the second debate , and they ask him , ' do you think age is a problem ? ' he had that answer prepared , and boy did he nail it			0
it was subtle , it was humorous , and @entity117 knew , he said right then , that he had not only lost the debate , but probably the election			0
1988 -- @entity143 vs. @entity142 : ' if your wife , @entity143 , were raped and murdered ? ' the question asked to @entity147 in 1988 was a difficult one			2
i mean , ' what would you do , given your feelings about the death penalty , if your wife , @entity143 , were raped and murdered ? ' and what you would 've expected might have been a home run , where @entity143 would 've said , ' i would 've wanted to kill that person who murdered my wife			0
but we have a country of laws and that would be wrong			0
' but instead , he answered in a policy - wonkish way about the death penalty that underscored a vulnerability that he already seemed to be without emotion and without passion			0
1988 -- @entity169 vs. @entity170 : ' you 're no @entity24 ' during the campaign , @entity170 had already been saying many times that he had as much experience as @entity24 did , so @entity169 was primed for that and when he mentioned it again in the debate , i 'm sure @entity169 was saying ' yay ! here comes my line ! ' and again , @entity170 handled it ok and said it probably was n't called for but it was such a zinger of a line that people loved it and told one another about it and it became the line of that debate			1
opinion : the mistakes candidates make in debates 1992 -- @entity142 looks at his watch it looked like he was bored , that he did n't care about the debate and that underscored the feeling that he was n't connected to the problems of the people and the country			1
he later said when he was looking he was looking at his watch he was thinking , ' i hate these debates , i 'm so glad it 's almost over			1
' in that debate @entity202 showed his empathy -- he was wandering around the stage			1
he talked to the people , almost wrapped their arms around them			0
the debate format in that year was perfect for @entity202 because they could wander away from the microphones			1
when @entity142 is seen stiffly to be looking at his watch and seemed not engaged , and not connected , it underscored @entity202 's enormous capacity to emotionally connect			1
1992 -- @entity213 vs. @entity214 : ' who am i ? why am i here ? ' when [ @entity218 ] @entity217 had chosen [ @entity213 as his [ running mate ] , @entity213 appeared to in that debate to be stunned ; he almost did n't seem to belong there			0
he looked like an observer of the other two candidates and that was underlined when he said , ' who am i , what am i doing here ? ' what it underscored was a problem of judgment on @entity217 's part -- how could he have chosen somebody who himself was wondering , ' why am i here ? ' it made no sense to the audience and it hurt @entity217 's credibility as a presidential candidate			2
2000 -- @entity238 sighs focus groups right after @entity238 and @entity239 debated seemed to give a slight edge to @entity238 because he was more articulate , he had better answers , but once the television cameras caught that sighing , that constant look on his face where he seemed annoyed by the whole idea of having to be there with @entity142 , it seemed to underscore , as somebody said , as a teacher 's pet who knew all the answers but was annoying and irritating			1
and they kept playing it over and over again and it became parodies on the comedy shows and late night tv			0
then people began to project onto @entity238 a personality trait of just annoyance and irritation of people in general and it became devastating for him to live that down .			0

historian @entity1 says debates reveal character *strengths* and weaknesses
1960 debate *contrasted* " vigorous " @entity24 with " sallow " @entity25
@entity72 's humor *defused* @entity45 's *indignation* in 1980 debate
with a glance at his watch , @entity142 underscored @entity202 's ability to connect
