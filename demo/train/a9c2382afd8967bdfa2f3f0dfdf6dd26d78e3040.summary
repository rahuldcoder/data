-- the unbearable stench of rotting flesh			2
the search for relatives under heaps of rubble			2
the desperate pleas for food and water			1
this is the scene playing out across much of the eastern @entity11 after @entity12 tore through			1
just a few days ago , @entity13 was a bustling city ; now , it 's a devastated wasteland			1
how did this happen ? here 's a moment - by - moment account of how the typhoon plowed through the @entity11 and changed the lives of millions forever			1
@entity20 : @entity12 's impact anxiety before the storm even before @entity12 struck friday morning , forecasters warned it might be the strongest storm in recorded history			1
it was 3.5 times more ferocious than @entity28 -- and big enough to stretch from @entity29 to @entity30			2
more than 700,000 @entity11 heeded warnings and evacuated to @entity32 shelters , @entity11 @entity32 chairman @entity31 said			1
but even emergency shelters proved no match for the storm			1
" people died there as well , " @entity31 said			1
the first hit the deafening winds started howling around 5 a.m. friday			2
that 's when the super typhoon made landfall in the eastern @entity11			1
but it was n't the abysmal 380 - kph ( 235 - mph ) wind gusts that pulverized @entity48 province			2
it was the epic 5 - meter - tall ( 16 - foot - high ) wall of ocean water that crushed the city of @entity13 , smashing houses and floating them away			1
within seconds , the storm surge ripped children out of their parents ' arms and washed them out to sea			1
three of @entity61 's daughters -- ages 8 , 13 and 15 -- were among those torn away			2
@entity61 and his wife later found the bodies of the two younger girls			0
" only the eldest one is missing , " @entity61 said through tears			0
" i hope she 's alive			0
" interactive : ' the one building that survived the storm ' deadly debris in the water moments after the storm surge came the next danger -- countless hazards in the rushing water , now up to two stories high			1
@entity81 's daughter was impaled by wooden splinters from smashed houses			0
the mother tried to help , but her daughter insisted she leave her behind , @entity81 said			0
" @entity86 , just let go			0
save yourself , " @entity81 quoted her daughter 's last words to the @entity89			0
@entity0 's @entity91 and @entity92 and a team of storm chasers chronicled @entity12 's wrath from a hotel in @entity13			1
but they quickly realized they would have to jump into the water and double as rescue workers to save those on the ground floor			1
" the water came up with such alarming speed that it caught these people off guard , " storm chaser @entity103 said			1
he ca n't shake " the chilling sound of a woman screaming desperately as she was smashing a window with her hands			0
" armed with mattresses , they ferried an elderly woman and a disabled woman across waist - high stormwater			2
but one of @entity103 ' colleagues , @entity116 , suffered a massive leg injury when a rusty , jagged piece of sheet metal sliced his shin to the bone from under the water			2
apocalyptic scene as the mammoth flooding began to subside , it left behind a catastrophic scene -- heaps atop of heaps of rubble where people were still trapped			0
by saturday , officials found more than 100 bodies scattered on the streets of @entity13			1
and that 's just one city			0
the @entity11 has thousands of islands			1
and calculating the damage across all of them -- not to mention getting crucial aid to survivors -- has been greatly hindered by power outages , damaged airports and debris - covered roads			2
the @entity11 @entity32 chairman said saturday it may be another day or two before aid can arrive in @entity13			1
" it really is an awful , awful situation , " @entity31 said			0
desperate for food and water , some residents broke into grocery stores to keep their families alive			1
others found themselves suddenly without families			0
" our house got demolished , " one woman told @entity0 affiliate @entity157			0
" my father died after being hit by falling wooden debris			1
we are calling for your help			0
if possible , please bring us food			2
we do n't have anything to eat			0
" one man said he was still trying to find six family members			0
" my child has been buried in that island , " he said			0
pleas for aid for days , residents decried what they called incredibly slow aid responses -- including by local authorities			1
but there 's a reason for that , @entity13 mayor @entity174 said tuesday			1
" we were paralyzed here in the city government , " the mayor said			2
" out of 300 policemen , only less than 30 were able to make it and showed up			0
and many are still missing			0
" some residents have gone days without food or water			1
in an act of desperation , many walked hours to the @entity13 airport searching for sustenance and a chance to escape			1
" get international help to come here now -- not tomorrow , now , " @entity194 said			0
" this is really , really , like , bad			0
" the countless dead no one knows how many people @entity12 killed			0
by tuesday , officials had counted 1,774 of the bodies , but say that number may just be scratching the surface			0
some say a death toll of 10,000 is entirely possible			0
" we have bodies in the water , bodies on the bridges , bodies on the side of the road , " the @entity208 chairman said			2
the @entity13 mayor added that untold numbers of bodies are also hidden under rubble			1
more concerns ahead the thick stench of decomposing bodies forced many survivors to cover their faces with towels or shirts			0
but between grieving the dead and fighting for their own survival , it may be among the least of their worries			0
but the next concern is sanitation -- and whether those bodies could lead to a wave of disease			0
surrounded by rubble , children swarmed around a public well in @entity13			1
they doused themselves with water and fill plastic cups and jugs			2
" even though we 're not sure that it is clean and safe , " @entity244 said , " we still drink it , because we need to survive			0
" @entity0 's @entity91 , @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 in the @entity11 and @entity251 in @entity252 contributed to this report .			1
