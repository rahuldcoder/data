-- as @entity2 emerged onto the 18th fairway and saw his ball just yards from the spot where @entity6 fired his famous one iron to the green in 1950 , he knew it was his moment to seize the @entity11 crown			1
the 32 - year - old knew if he could repeat @entity6 's par on the notoriously tricky 18th hole at @entity15 in @entity16 he could end @entity18 's 43 - year wait for a champion in @entity21 's national championship			1
with thoughts of his late father @entity24 swirling round his mind , @entity22 struck a near - perfect approach shot and duly completed par. when @entity29 failed to birdie the same hole moments later , @entity22 had sealed his first major triumph			1
it meant success at the 37th time of asking for @entity22 , who became the first @entity18 to win a major since @entity38 's @entity37 success in 1996			1
" i just had to stand up there and be counted , " he told @entity40			0
" it was a major , it was my moment , it was stand up and deliver			2
" it was a special moment when i walked over the hill and saw my ball sitting right there on the up slope in the middle of the fairway			0
" @entity6 definitely popped into my mind because i know he hit the green and two - putted to get into a playoff			0
" someone had chirped from the crowd ' @entity22 , a good iron shot , two putts and its yours			1
' and in a sense that was all i was trying to do at that point			0
" @entity22 held his nerve at the end of a day that fluctuated wildly , as crowd favorite @entity29 desperately tried to nail down victory in a tournament he had finished runner up in five times			1
an audacious chip in for eagle from @entity73 at the tenth hole swung the momentum his way but @entity22 responded immediately , with birdies at the 12th and 13th			1
and as he negotiated the fiendishly difficult closing stretch of holes in just one - over - par , it left @entity29 needing a birdie on the last to force a playoff			1
he could n't , which left an emotional @entity22 with his own special moment on @entity85 , as he remembered his dad @entity24 , who lost his battle with cancer in 2002			1
" i 've thought about my dad quite a bit this week , " @entity22 explained to @entity90 anchor @entity89			1
" saturday i was driving to the course and i looked in the rear view mirror and saw my eyes and that was one thing my dad always knew -- he could tell by the look in my eyes if i was going to play well or not			2
" i thought ' i wonder how my dad thinks i 'm going to play today			2
' i always knew the @entity11 finishes on @entity85 and i 'd been in contention most of the week and i really wanted that moment i could share with him and honor him			1
" he sacrificed so much for me and taught me the game			0
i 've seen @entity104 ( @entity105 ) celebrate with his dad , @entity107 ( @entity108 ) celebrate with his dad			0
" i 've always thought that moment must just be so special and for me , today , it was special in my own way			0
" the new world @entity113 burst onto the scene as an amateur at the 1998 @entity117 when he finished fourth			0
but that early promise stalled as he missed 21 cuts in a row after turning professional			0
he has steadily been working his way towards the summit of the game with notable victories on the @entity126 and a stellar showing for @entity128 in the @entity129 at @entity130 last year			0
but he revealed it is only recently he has felt his game was equipped to capture one of golf 's major prizes			2
" i 've been a pro a long time now -- 14 or 15 years -- but not until recently have i felt truly ready , " he said			0
" you try and kid yourself you are ready but this is one of the first majors i 've ever played where i came in knowing if i go about my business i 'm going to be hard to beat			0
" it 's just a really nice feeling to have that cleared off the plate now fairly early and it 's a lot of boyhood dreams paying off			2

@entity2 tells @entity0 his @entity11 victory is a boyhood dream come true
@entity22 's victory *poignant* on @entity85 as he remembered his late dad @entity24
@entity18 beat @entity155 and @entity29 into second place at @entity15
@entity22 becomes first @entity18 to win a major championship in 17 years
