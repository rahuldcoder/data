@entity0 -- @entity4 offered to stop attacking coalition troops in @entity6 nearly four years ago in an attempt to get the @entity8 to accept @entity10 's nuclear program , a @entity3 diplomat told the @entity11 in an interview aired saturday			1
@entity13 , @entity3 ambassador to the @entity14 , told @entity11 of @entity4 approaching @entity16 nations with offer			1
" the @entity4 wanted to be able to strike a deal whereby they stopped killing our forces in @entity6 in return for them being allowed to carry on with their nuclear program -- ' we stop killing you in @entity6 , stop undermining the political process there , you allow us to carry on with our nuclear program without let or hindrance , " said @entity13 , now the @entity3 ambassador to the @entity14 , in the documentary , " @entity4 and the @entity8 : @entity33			1
" the @entity34 and other @entity16 nations believe @entity4 is pursuing a nuclear weapons program , but @entity4 says it is developing nuclear capability to produce energy			2
@entity4 also has been accused of sponsoring terrorists and supplying weapons to @entity6 insurgents			1
the latter prompted a warning from the @entity34 that such behavior by @entity10 " would be regarded by us as enemy action , " @entity42 , a @entity43 counselor , told the @entity11			2
then , @entity4 began shopping its offer around @entity50 , @entity13 said			2
@entity53 , @entity3 's political director at the time , reveals the behind - the - scene talks from 2005 -- when roadside bombing against @entity3 and @entity34 soldiers in @entity6 peaked -- were held with @entity3 , @entity58 and @entity59 diplomats at hotels in @entity0 , @entity61 and @entity62			2
" and then we 'd compare notes among the three of us , " @entity13 told the @entity11			2
the @entity3 government dismissed the offer and @entity4 's nuclear enrichment program restarted once again , the @entity11 reports @entity4 has denied offering any such deal and reiterated its position saturday			1
" @entity4 's high officials have repeatedly stated that @entity4 has not had any part in attacks against @entity34 and @entity3 forces , and there is no evidence to support these baseless accusations , " @entity71 spokesman @entity70 said , according to the semi-official @entity72			0
interviews with top brass from former president @entity84 's administration and @entity3 envoys indicate that @entity4 and the @entity8 had neared agreements several times in the past few years , but never reached success			1
@entity88 , who was in charge of the @entity84 administration 's @entity43 policy with @entity4 , said taking a tough approach with @entity4 did n't seem effective			0
" we had advocated regime change , " @entity88 told the @entity11			0
" we had a very threatening posture towards @entity4 for a number of years			0
it did n't produce any movement whatsoever			0
" the documentary aired a day after the @entity100 - based @entity99 released a report stating that @entity4 scientists have reached " nuclear weapons breakout capability			0
" the report analyzed the finding of the @entity14 's nuclear watchdog agency , the @entity108 ( @entity108 )			0
however , an @entity108 official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data , saying @entity4 's stock of low - enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium ( @entity115 ) in order to be weapons - grade material			0
that has n't been done , the official said			0
meanwhile , @entity4 's relationship with the @entity8 continues to be strained , though both sides have indicated interest in holding direct talks			1
president @entity125 , in his first prime - time news conference held earlier this month , said the @entity34 is looking for opportunities for " face - to - face " talks with @entity4 after an absence of diplomatic ties for nearly three decades			1
" there 's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years , so it 's not going to happen overnight , " he said			0
and @entity4 's powerful parliament speaker and former nuclear negotiator , @entity137 , has called the @entity125 administration " an exceptional opportunity for @entity34			1

@entity4 approached diplomats with offer nearly four years ago , @entity11 told
diplomat : @entity4 offered to stand down in @entity6 if @entity8 would accept its nuke program
@entity4 denies involvement in *fighting* in @entity6 , says *allegations* are " baseless "
despite strained relations , @entity125 administration has hinted at direct talks
