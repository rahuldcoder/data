@entity0 , @entity1 -- the tabloid - friendly tale of the so - called @entity6 " @entity5 " continues to stir debate -- this time 2,000 miles away in the @entity8 , where lawmakers say they 're trying to prevent a repeat			1
proposed legislation regulating in - vitro practices came after @entity5 gave birth to octuplets			1
a @entity1 state senator introduced legislation to limit the number of embryos that can be implanted in a woman 's uterus during in - vitro fertilization procedures			1
sen. @entity22 , a @entity23 from near @entity24 , @entity1 , said his legislation was inspired by @entity5 , the woman who said she gave birth to octuplets after being fertilized with six embryos -- an unusually high number			1
" she is not married , " said @entity22			0
" she is unemployed , she is on government assistance and now she is going to put those 14 children on the back of the taxpayers in the state of @entity6			2
" @entity5 , 33 , had six children before the procedure			1
@entity22 ' plan , which was co-sponsored by several other senators , would limit the number of embryos a doctor could implant to two for women under 40 years old and three for women 40 or older			1
those numbers are slightly less than what 's considered the norm in medical circles			0
the @entity48 recommends no more than two embryos for women under 35 years old and no more than five for women over 40			1
the reason for allowing more embryos in women over 40 is that it is more difficult for them to get pregnant			1
state lawmakers in @entity58 are considering a similar bill			2
and @entity60 and @entity61 have had similar limits on the books for years			0
at least some fertility doctors say the limits in @entity22 ' bill would hurt chances for women to get pregnant			2
they say that while three embryos are usually enough , there are special cases when they need more			0
" what this bill will effectively do is shut us down , " said dr. @entity72 , a fertility doctor in @entity0			0
" patients seeking reproductive care in @entity1 will go to @entity78 or @entity79 or @entity80			2
" breaking the law would carry a fine of up to $ 1,000 under the legislation			0
some critics of the plan also see another problem , calling it a backdoor effort to outlaw abortions in the state			1
the bill , which @entity22 titled the " @entity91 , " contains language that says " a living in vitro human embryo is a biological human being who is not the property of any person or entity			0
" the anti-abortion group @entity100 issued a news release in support of the bill on the day it was introduced			0
" @entity100 supports sen. @entity22 in this legislation and wants to see strong protections in place to stop the dangerous practice of implanting more embryos than is medically recommended , " the group said , saying the plan would help avoid premature births and low birth weight in in - vitro fertilization cases			0
realistically , the bill faces long odds of passing -- at least in the near future			1
tuesday was day 25 of the @entity1 legislature 's 40 - day session			1
legislators will meet 10 more days , then take a break until june , when lawmakers will consider how money flowing to the state from the federal economic - stimulus plan may help their ongoing budget woes			0
according the the @entity1 legislature 's web site on tuesday , @entity22 ' bill had been read and assigned to a committee , but no other action had taken place			1
some @entity133 from the lawmaker 's part of the state say they hope he has to keep waiting for a long time			2
" unless the senator is a physician , ethicist or other informed professional , he should step aside and let the medical professionals determine what is best in individual cases , " @entity136 wrote in a letter to the editor of the @entity139 , @entity22 ' hometown paper			0
" there are other issues more important to the citizens of @entity1 that should be addressed			2
" @entity2 's @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 state senator says bill was inspired by " @entity5 " @entity5
@entity157 would limit women under 40 to two embryos , women 40 or older to three
critics call it a backdoor effort to outlaw abortions in the state
@entity157 faces long odds of passing because of timing in @entity1 legislature
