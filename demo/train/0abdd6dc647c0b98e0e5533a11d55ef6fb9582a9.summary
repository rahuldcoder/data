every year , more than 200,000 @entity1 children are born with sickle - cell anemia -- around 150,000 of those in @entity3			1
at the @entity6 ( @entity7 ) , rows of young women line up inside the antenatal clinic			2
many of them suffer from sickle - cell anemia , the world 's most common hereditary blood disorder			1
they are here to see dr @entity15 , a specialist practitioner who has dedicated much of her working life to studying the disease and how it affects pregnant women and their babies			1
" we have the highest number of people suffering from sickle - cell disease in the world , " explains @entity21 , an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology who consults twice a week at @entity7			1
her mission is to use her knowledge to cut maternal mortality in @entity3			2
around one in four people in the @entity1 country carries the sickle cell gene -- around 40 million people -- and virtually everyone has lost a relative or a close friend to the disease			1

normally , red blood cells are flexible and round , moving easily through blood vessels			0
in sickle - cell anemia , however , the red blood cells become rigid and sticky and are shaped like sickles or crescent moons			1
these irregularly shaped cells can get stuck in small blood vessels , which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to parts of the body			0
poor blood oxygen levels and blood vessel blockages can result in chronic acute pain syndromes , severe bacterial infections and tissue death , according to the @entity68			0
the sickle - cell trait has a partial protective effect against malaria , and this could explain its high prevalence levels in tropical parts of @entity75			1
for a child to be born with the condition , both parents must carry a sickle - cell gene , which is passed from one generation to the next			1
" if somebody with a trait marries another person with a trait , there 's an one in four chance that the offspring will have @entity90 , " explains @entity21			0

" very few people are doing research in pregnancy in @entity90 women , " says @entity21			2
" what i 'm doing is adding to the body of knowledge that exists and putting on some more , especially since physiological research in pregnancy is not very common			0
" it 's strange because even ... in the @entity111 you do have quite a number of african - americans that get pregnant with sickle - cell , but the research even from there is not that much at all in pregnancies			1
" @entity21 says that life expectancy for people with sickle - cell disease is still fairly low -- around late 40s or early 50s			1
but she is quick to point out that many advances have been made in recent decades			0
" things have changed since the 1940s , " she says			0
" about 40 , 50 years ago it was n't even getting close [ to their 50s ] , so a lot of people were n't even getting pregnant ... because they could n't live long enough to get pregnant -- a lot of them died in childhood			2
" @entity21 studied at the @entity132 in @entity133 before moving to the @entity134 to further her knowledge and gain work experience			0
she could have stayed in @entity139 to carve out a successful career but @entity141 decided to go back to @entity3 and help improve things in her home country			2
" i just had to come back because i felt that this is where i 'm needed , this is where i can make a difference , " she says			0
" i really love what i do			0
it can be frustrating because sometimes we have electricity problems ... but the fact that we save so many lives ... because of the work we do , i think that 's the most fulfilling thing for a doctor			0

" we know now that one of the ways we can reduce maternal mortality effectively is by having women deliver in healthcare institutions or at least with skilled healthcare , " she says			0
@entity21 adds that she 's driven by her passion to make pregnancy safer and reduce the stress that women go through while pregnant			2
" i would really love the incidents of maternal mortality in my country to be so much more reduced than it is now , " she says			0
" because of my work with women with sickle - cell and pregnancy , i would like to get to a stage where , not only would it be that the mortality in pregnancy is zero ... i 'd also like to try to find out how to improve the perinatal health as well , the health of their babies so that they would have larger babies and not have so much of mortality , " she adds			1
" that is a tough call ... to change that around is a feat but i plan to continue to work on it for as long as i can			0
