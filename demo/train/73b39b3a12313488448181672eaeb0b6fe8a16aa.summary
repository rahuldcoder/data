-- ever since the early 1960s when we were glued to the animated sitcom " @entity4 " , whimsical visions of a futuristic space utopia filled our imaginations leaving people asking themselves : " where 's my flying car ? " point taken , but perhaps now , as our childhood dreams move slowly closer to reality , we should also start pondering this : if a flying car was here today , in the real world and not in the realm of science fiction , would we feel comfortable controlling it safely while cruising thousands of feet up in the air ? would we possess the technical skills required to even get it off the ground , let alone land it without a scratch ? before you dash to the door and sprint to your nearest pilot school to sign up for flight lessons , take a moment to meet @entity32 , the chief executive and co-founder of aerospace company @entity34			1
@entity32 and his team are working to bring consumers closer to the prospect of a practical flying car , envisioning a vehicle that does not require its operator to be a trained pilot			1
thus , @entity42 - based @entity34 announced last may it had started working on the concept of @entity44 , a four - seat , plug - in hybrid electric car that can do vertical take - offs and landings			1
who makes the calls ? although not driverless , @entity32 says the @entity44 could increase the level of so - called " human directed local autonomy , " a term he describes as a " big fancy phrase " that essentially means that the vehicle 's operator wo n't need to have the knowledge or skills of a pilot			1
" they do n't need to know those things because the computer is plugged in to a data network that automatically helps them plan the flight path , avoid other air traffic and air space restrictions , things of that nature , " says @entity32			0
he explains that operators would still have to make high - level , critical decisions , like determining whether it 's safe to take off and land or approve the landing zone in advance			1
" anything that happens on the ground , the person is going to make a call , " says @entity32			0
" once you 're flying , the actual operation of all the flight control surfaces is going to be computer controlled because , frankly , the computer can do it better than a pilot			0
" yet , if you have the vision that the semi-autonomous vehicle would help you escape annoying traffic jams by simply taking off the ground , you 'd better think again			0
" that 's science fiction and that will always be science fiction , " says @entity32 , explaining that vertical liftoffs require a lot of air to be blown down which is not practical and can cause damages to neighboring vehicles			2
instead , @entity44 would be able to take off in airports and helipads , as well as specially designed spaces -- the size of a tennis court -- that would be devoid of street lights , road signs and power lines			2
from dreams to reality yet , the @entity44 concept is not @entity34 's first attempt to take to the skies			1
founded in 2006 , the company made headlines in recent years with @entity114 , a street legal airplane that can be flown in and out of general aviation airports			2
more like a driveable plane than a flying car , the two - seat vehicle can fold up its wings -- just like putting the top down into a convertible car -- and fly with a cruise speed of 100 miles per hour ; it can also be parked inside a single car garage , driven on the road on a highway speed and run on automotive gasoline			1
@entity34 has been flying prototypes of @entity114 since 2009 and is now very close to getting it to the market			2
" we have over 100 orders for @entity114 , " says @entity32 , adding that @entity114 costs $ 279,000			0
" we are expecting to ship the first products to customers in the second quarter of 2016			0
" but in order for users to be able to fly the transition , they would need to have at least a sport pilot 's license , which requires 20 hours of flight time -- most sport pilots take 30 - 35 hours to get their sport pilot certificates			2
with its new prototype , however , @entity34 believes that just five hours would be enough for users to learn how to operate the @entity44 vehicle , appealing to a broader segment of the population			1
@entity32 says all operators will need to know is how to interface with the vehicle , how to determine if it 's to safe to take off and land and what to do on the event of an emergency -- in those cases , operators would be able to pull a handle which would be able to activate a parachute system for the entire vehicle by pulling a handle			0
future is now ? so , how far away are we from our first ever @entity44 air cruise ? " it 's hard to say exactly , but we estimate eight to12 years , " says @entity32 , who admits that even if @entity34 had all the capital required to develop @entity168 -- which it does n't -- the realization of the project depends on technological developments as well as regulators changing the way aircraft are currently certified			1
@entity32 says @entity34 is " heavily involved " with international committees to write new certification standards that account for some of the new technologies that are increasingly coming to the market for manned and unmanned aircraft , and which also apply to @entity44 --- things like electric motors and batteries for general aviation aircraft			1
" those sort of things have never been certified before so we do n't know how long it will take for regulatory bodies to adapt to the new technology , " he says			0
" the rules are all very old , the rules need to be updated , " adds @entity32			0
" if the rules are successfully updated then we see the possibility for somebody to get what we call a @entity44 operator 's permit in as little as five hours			2
" ultimately , @entity32 says , the goal of the whole @entity204 " is to make the idea of the flying car a reality			1
" " in order to do that , we have to lower the barrier entry to aviation , " he adds			0
" we have to make it easier , we have to make it safer , we have to make it faster than driving your car , and we have to make it significantly more convenient than operating an airplane today , " continues @entity32			0
" it 's going to take a while to get there , but that 's the goal			0

aerospace company @entity34 is working on the concept of a flying electric car
called @entity44 , the vehicle is designed to be capable of vertical take - offs and landings
the goal is to make personal aviation *accessible* to a broader segment of the population
the company estimates a period of 8 - 12 years before it 's able to develop @entity44 - @entity44
