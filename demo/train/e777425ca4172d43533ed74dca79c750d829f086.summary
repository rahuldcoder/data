@entity0 , @entity1 -- by spending a few days here in @entity5 's fifth - largest city -- which also happens to be at the heart of the nation 's immigration debate -- i had the chance to see this volatile issue from many different vantage points			1
but as far i know , i did n't see any terror babies			1
regular viewers of @entity2 's " @entity15 " will recognize that term as referring to children born on @entity5 soil to illegal immigrants			1
the children are automatically granted @entity5 citizenship under the 14th amendment and then are smuggled back to their home countries to be raised as pint - sized , @entity5 - hating terrorists			1
then decades later , when the children have grown into adults , they could easily -- because of their @entity5 citizenship -- re-enter the @entity5 to attack it from within			1
so terror babies are sort of like a sleeper cell , one that has to be put down for a nap every few hours or it gets fussy			1
is this a scary scenario ? you bet			0
is it anything close to reality ? it does n't look like it			0
in fact , what 's really scary are opportunistic lawmakers out there who will sink to new depths to scare the @entity42 out of people in order to drum up support for the radical idea of changing the 14th amendment or scrapping it altogether			1
that 's what this story is really about			2
it 's an elaborate pitch to that constituency who believes that illegal immigrants are unfairly taking advantage of a constitutional provision that makes anyone born on @entity5 soil an @entity5 citizen			1
the two @entity61 republicans who are actively spinning this yarn -- state representative @entity64 and @entity5 congressman @entity65 -- both appeared on @entity15 's show this week , and neither could provide any evidence of the existence of these mythical terror babies			1
in fact , in the face of questioning by @entity15 , both got extremely defensive			0
you might say these @entity77 fear mongers were acting in a way that could be accurately described as infantile			1
@entity64 and @entity65 claimed they got the information from conversations with " former @entity83 officials			0
" so @entity15 interviewed @entity2 contributor @entity84 , who served as the @entity83 's assistant director in the office of international operations from 2004 to 2008			2
" the @entity83 has 75 offices overseas , including offices in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , " @entity84 said			0
" there was never a credible report -- or any report , for that matter -- coming across through all the various mechanisms of communication to indicate that there was such a plan for these terror babies to be born			1
" the @entity83 has also done everything it can to knock down the story as simply not credible			0
of course , this tall tale is n't credible ; it 's probably nothing more than a figment of politicians ' imaginations			2
but it is valuable since it helps illustrate a disturbing phenomenon here in @entity1 , where supporters of the state 's new immigration law seem to feel as if they have to justify the measure not only by scaring people , but also by doing extreme makeovers			1
they take things that are familiar and try to make them sinister			0
those are n't @entity5 citizen babies , they say ; they 're future terrorists			1
those are n't run - of - the - mill illegal immigrants who come to @entity1 to work and feed their families ; they 're drug mules for the @entity132 cartels , says @entity1 gov. @entity134			0
and those are n't coyotes , immigrant smugglers bringing people in the @entity5 as they have for generations ; they 're drug cartels , which -- according to @entity134 -- now control all the immigrant smuggling operations into the @entity5			1
the @entity141 was just as quick to knockdown those stories as untrue as the @entity83 was in refuting the story about terror babies using the 14th amendment to do us harm			1
i was glad to see that			0
there is already enough dishonesty in the immigration debate ; we certainly do n't need any more coming from the state of @entity1			2
yet , there is a steady trickle of deceptions and half - truths			0
the three big fibs -- repeated by top @entity77 officials -- are that the federal government is n't doing its job to protect the borders , that the law is an attempt to crack down on drug cartels , and that race is n't part of the discussion			2
none of that is true			0
so why repeat it ? those who believe in the state 's immigration law and consider it a good idea to empower local police and sheriff 's deputies to enforce federal immigration law should stand by the legislation as it is written			2
they should n't have to try to create an alternate reality to win over more supporters			0
a prominent @entity132 - @entity5 attorney , who has long been a visible and vocal member of @entity0 's @entity189 community , warned me against trying to make sense of the opposition			1
for instance , i asked him , how could people continue to argue that the @entity196 administration is n't doing enough to secure the border when all the evidence suggests otherwise ? " you 'll never be able to convince people of that , " he said			0
" because their motivation is political			0
it 's not based in reality			2
" i 'm afraid that 's not good enough			0
if the supporters of @entity209 really believe in the merits of their cause , they should be able to win the argument on the natural , without relying on hocus - pocus or scare tactics or radical makeovers			2
and if they ca n't do that , if they have to portray babies as terrorists and immigrants as drug mules in order to win support for their side , then this should tell them loud and clear that they 're on the wrong side of this issue -- not to mention , on the wrong side of history			0
no amount of spin can change that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238			2

two @entity61 @entity77 claim the 14th amendment could aid terrorist goals to attack @entity5
@entity238 says the " terror babies " fear is *groundless*
he says it 's the latest scare tactic being used to whip up a *frenzy* over immigration
@entity238 : let 's have a debate about immigration on the merits , not on fantasy
