-- when i was a little girl , i watched a lot of tv			2
i loved sitcoms and had a special love for talk and variety shows			2
i loved it @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 came on , but there was no one who affected me like @entity15			1
like every other misfit @entity17 girl growing up in the suburbs of @entity19 , i may have adored @entity20 , but i could relate to @entity15			1
she was a perfect stand - up comic			1
self - deprecating without being self - deprecating			2
and she was always the smartest person in the room			2
every time she came on tv , my mother would say , " you know she graduated @entity27 from @entity28 ... @entity29			2
" ( my mother was obsessed with @entity17 celebrities , and @entity29 graduates )			2
but the best part of @entity15 was how she made me laugh			1
and i mean belly laugh			2
and if you know a comic , you know that we do n't laugh easily			1
@entity15 was a role model to comics everywhere , but especially to women			1
she got the first laugh and the last laugh			2
when the kids in school taunted me because of the way i looked ( 6 - foot - 2 at 13 ) , my mother advised me to act like i could n't hear them			2
i would come up with insults and retorts and play them out in my head , but those insults never came out of my mouth			2
i censored myself , something @entity15 had the courage to never do			1
humor is the best way to get your point across and nobody got their point across better than @entity15			1
this tiny little loud - mouthed @entity17 woman was my hero			2
when @entity15 walked through the curtain on " @entity62 , " nobody in my house was allowed to utter a sound			1
her gait was full of pep and purpose and her voice unmatched			0
her first appearance was in 1965 , when i was 3			0
@entity70 called her over to the couch and whispered , " you 're going to be a star			0
" she looked behind her to see if he was talking to someone else			0
she kept working in clubs , opening for other celebrities , writing jokes and books , recording albums , and being a mother -- and eventually a single mother			0
she never revealed her pain and struggles , she just kept on working -- making other people laugh			0
we all know showbiz is n't easy , but being a comic -- especially being a female comic -- can be quite punishing			1
whenever it got rough enough for me to wonder , " is this really worth it ? " i immediately thought about @entity15			1
it was she who made me never , ever give up			0
she was sometimes vilified for saying exactly what she thought ( something no one in our business had ever done before or has done since )			0
everything and everyone was fair game			0
she found humor in the most tragic , forlorn and traumatic circumstances			0
yes , she offended lots of people , but she laughed at herself first			0
she knew what you were thinking and trumped you with a joke every time			0
it 's one thing to be able to say the thing everyone else wishes they could think of saying , but it 's another thing to say it with aplomb , even as you know you 're opening yourself up to recrimination			0
whether it was her plastic surgery , her age or her weight , she beat you to it			0
when i first met @entity15 , on this silly shopping show she was doing , i was so nervous			1
but she put me right at ease with her warmth and humility			0
whenever i saw her after that , she would bestow loving , motherly , sage advice upon me			1
after my first son was born , i told her i was worried that i was screwing up his sleep because he would always wake up in the middle of the night when i got home from a gig and we would end up hanging out until he fell back asleep			1
said @entity15 : " who cares ! the most important thing is not what time it is when you spend time with your child - it 's that you spend time with your child			1
" i told her once : " i hope you know all you have done for female comics			1
we would n't be here without you			0
" " oh baloney ! ! i did nothing , " she replied			0
that 's all that matters -- and that you do n't let anyone take your hard - earned money ! ! do everything yourself ! " she would never listen to how great she was , but she would always make you feel like a million bucks			1
@entity15 broke down barriers , advocated for free speech , and never apologized for who she was			1
everyone knew how much she loved her daughter and her grandson			0
she loved the people she worked with			1
but just like every other @entity17 mother , she was uncomfortable hearing about how much she was loved			0
a few weeks ago , i emailed her and asked if her ears were burning because fellow stand - up @entity170 and i were up at the @entity171 talking with some other comics about how much we loved her and how good she was to us			1
she emailed back , " adore you both			0
@entity175 " she was so much more than a simple girl with a dream			0
she gave so many funny little misfit girls permission to dream			1
thank you does n't seem nearly enough			0
this is a really hard one .			1
