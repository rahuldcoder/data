@entity0 , @entity1 -- extra-time goals from @entity3 and @entity4 gave @entity5 a 3 - 2 victory over @entity7 to send the @entity0 side into a @entity10 final showdown against @entity12 rivals @entity11 , 4 - 3 on aggregate			1
@entity4 ( right ) and @entity3 both found the net as @entity5 secured their final place in @entity16			1
@entity3 , playing his first game since the death of his mother last week , coolly slotted home a 98th - minute penalty and @entity4 , who had opened the scoring in the first - half , sent @entity5 to the final in @entity16 on may 21 with a timely second goal			1
@entity26 had given @entity7 hope with a second - half equaliser but they failed to finish the job and @entity5 made them pay in a pulsating extra period which also saw @entity32 grab a late consolation goal for the visitors			1
@entity4 , who @entity7 manager @entity35 had accused of being a ' diver ' prior to the match , looked like a man on a mission to ram the @entity41 words down his throat			1
the @entity44 striker forced @entity45 to turn his skidding 15 - meter effort around the post in the fifth minute			0
four minutes later , @entity7 put together their only meaningful move of the opening half when a quick @entity51 pass put @entity26 in behind the @entity5 defense			1
however , the @entity41 striker 's first touch was not deft enough and although he bore down on @entity56 , the @entity5 goalkeeper did well to close down his space and options			2
the wet conditions hampered both sides but it was @entity5 who mastered them quicker			2
in the 18th minute , @entity3 despatched a delightful pass into the path of @entity4 but the striker was a meter wide with his shot			1
@entity5 were in the ascendancy and their supremacy was underlined by @entity71 's 20 - meter effort which had to be collected by @entity45 at the foot of his right - hand post			1
@entity7 were struggling to keep pace with the home side and their worries increased when central defender @entity77 was forced off with a knee injury in the 21st minute to be replaced by @entity79			2
@entity45 was forced to punch clear a long - range effort from @entity81 but the goal @entity5 had threatened for most of the half arrived in style in the 33rd minute			1
the architect was @entity1 midfielder @entity3			2
he cleverly split the @entity7 defense to give @entity87 the chance to run on and fire a shot that @entity45 could only palm into the path of the onrushing @entity4			1
the @entity44 does not miss such gifts and he sent a low drive fizzing into the net at the near post to give @entity0 side a 2 - 1 aggregate lead			1
@entity4 , clearly hurt by @entity35 's criticism of his ' diving ' , then ran the length of the half to celebrate his goal in front of the @entity7 manager			1
@entity5 's domination almost brought them a second four minutes before the interval but @entity81 's measured free - kick veered just the wrong side of the post			1
@entity111 almost hauled @entity7 back into the tie three minutes after the restart but his shot met the outstretched leg of @entity56 before @entity116 cleared			2
after @entity3 's 53rd - minute volley was well held by @entity45 , @entity7 finally broke their goalscoring hoodoo when @entity119 carved out a chance for @entity26			1
the @entity121 collected the ball in his stride just inside the penalty area before sliding it beyond the exposed @entity56 to make it 2 - 2 on aggregate -- the 64th - minute effort was @entity7 's first at @entity126 in nine games under @entity35			1
both sides sought a winner -- but the 90 minutes ended all - square and the contest went into extra-time			0
@entity7 almost snatched the lead within minutes of the restart but @entity79 's header fell wide of the post with @entity56 beaten			2
@entity5 then thought they had done enough when @entity71 sent a 15 - meter effort into the net -- but it was rightly disallowed for offside			2
however , in the 98th minute , @entity81 was brought down by @entity79 inside the box and referee @entity143 pointed to the spot			0
@entity3 kept his composure to send @entity45 the wrong way and was in tears as he celebrated with his teammates near the corner flag			0
worse was to come for @entity7 when substitute @entity150 got free on the right and pulled the ball back for @entity4 to fire under @entity45			1
an error from @entity56 gifted @entity32 a late goal from longe range but @entity5 held on to reach their first ever @entity10 final			1
" this is something amazing			0
i am really pleased for the club because we have been looking for this final for too long , " said @entity4 , who admitted that he was " disappointed " by @entity35 's pre-match comments			2
" @entity35 is a fantastic coach and i was a bit disappointed but i think he felt his team was not strong enough and @entity5 were going to beat them			2
" i am just happy for my team and i do n't want to think about others			0
it 's not good for my image			0
i 'm giving my best to put my team at the top and i think it 's not fair but it 's finished now			0
" @entity35 believed his side were in control when they handed @entity5 the initiative in extra-time			0
the @entity121 said : " i thought we were very close			0
we played well in the second half but the third goal killed it			0
we had control of the game but missd two chances in extra-time			0
" @entity35 insisted he did not regret his criticism of @entity4 , saying : " i do n't think so , when you play a semifinal in the @entity10 i do n't think you think about anything other than that			1
" @entity5 manager @entity187 admitted he was proud to have succeeded in beating @entity35 's @entity7 in the @entity10 last four -- something his predecessor @entity189 failed to manage			1
" there is only one special one , " he joked			0
" but this was special against @entity7			0
they are a fantastic team and @entity35 played it tactically well			0
" you need to be clever against him but we did it			0
we have created history and i am very proud we did it my way -- but i do n't like to say ' i ' because owner @entity200 created this club			0
@entity187 , who has guided his team to a strong end - of - season charge on two fronts , also praised @entity3 's efforts in trying times			2
" @entity3 played very well and in my opinion was one of our key players today			0
it is not an easy thing			0
he gave everything to the team , " added @entity187			0

@entity5 beat @entity7 3 - 2 to reach @entity10 final 4 - 3 on aggregate
@entity4 scores twice and an *emotional* @entity3 is also on target
@entity5 to face title rivals @entity11 in an all - @entity223 final in @entity16
