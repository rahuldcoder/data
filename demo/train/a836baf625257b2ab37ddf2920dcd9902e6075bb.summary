@entity0 -- something strange is going on in @entity3			1
some of the biggest tv stars of the 20th century are donning luscious wigs and scaring the wits out of children			2
and @entity8 is n't in a position to stop them either -- she 's guilty of joining in herself			2
overweight men are squeezing themselves into dresses , young women are prancing about on stage incessantly slapping their own thighs , and everywhere families are wildly screaming " he 's behind you ! " it does n't make any sense			2
but then , that 's pantomime -- or " panto " as the @entity3 fondly refer to it -- a musical comedy unleashed across theaters every @entity28 season and like nothing you 've ever seen before			1
imagine your favorite childhood fairy tale -- " @entity33 , " " @entity34 , " or " @entity35			0
" now subvert it with cross-dressing , topical references , audience participation , big song and dance routines , and you 've pretty much got the idea			1
small stage , big names but wait			0
what 's this ? recently panto has been getting a celebrity makeover			1
once the realm of local actors , now international stars are getting involved			1
@entity53 , better known as " @entity54 , " from tv show " @entity57 , " and @entity56 , better known as , er , " @entity56 , " are wearing @entity59 wigs , badly drawn mustaches , and 45 kilograms of embroidered velvet as they bring to life one of the most infamous panto characters of all -- hook			1
" for me , there 's no other part , " said 68 - year - old @entity53 , who has been playing the @entity33 villain since 2006 , resurrecting him again at @entity0 's @entity66 this year			1
" all of a sudden you just hear the tiniest voice on the planet either yelling ' @entity72 ' or ' @entity33 ! he 's behind yoooouuu			0
' then when @entity33 is banishing me from @entity75 you hear this voice go ' yay ! ' and i turn to where it 's coming from and say ' well , i did n't like you much either			0
' it 's just great			0
" read this : step inside master clown 's fairy tale home and it 's true , one of the great joys of panto is seeing the audience erupt with lines that have been passed down through generations ; youngsters standing on their seats to yell " oh yes he is ! " while parents laugh at the sexual innuendo flying just above their heads			1
" it 's not the kind of theater - going experience where you have to sit still and shut up and feel that you have to be very educated to understand , " said professor @entity97 , chair in theater history at the @entity99			0
" i think one of the joys of seeing it with children is that you 've got an excuse to be a child again			0
" @entity113 eccentricity not even @entity8 is immune to the magic of panto , with a treasure trove of old photos recently revealing she wore her own curly wig when she played the male lead of prince @entity120 in a palace production of " @entity34 " in 1941			1
swimming in lace ruffles and silk knickerbockers , the then - 15 - year - old @entity8 starred opposite her 11 - year - old sister @entity124 -- who took the title role			0
" it 's the one opportunity for us to let our hair down , " said @entity97			0
" it seems like this weird , eccentrically @entity3 thing -- so of course we keep doing it because part of our national self - image is taking delight in being a bit odd and eccentric			1
" yes , the pantomime dame is a man dressed as a woman			0
yes , the princip boy , the hero , that 's a woman dressed up in tights and knee - high boots , slapping her thigh			1
" happy days and then there 's the larger - than - life villain			1
" everyone who is 35 - and - up recognizes me from ' @entity57 , ' said @entity53 , today a grandfather - of - three			2
" and they can call me the @entity54 all they want because they have also gone with me on my journey -- i 've never been restricted in my career by it , " adds the man who tells me that over his career he 's produced 19 years of tv series if you watched them back - to - back , and in 2011 received an @entity161 for his work with dyslexic children after also suffering from the condition			2
read this : 342 takes for one movie scene the @entity170 admits he never heard of panto before getting involved			2
but now he 's , ahem , hooked			0
" it 's the story of @entity33 with @entity174 in the middle -- it 's like chocolate candy with this delicious melted syrup in the center , " said @entity53			1
" as @entity180 , i 'm wearing about 100 pounds of velvet , i 'm wearing a @entity183 wig with curls down to my shoulders , i 'm wearing a hat			0
if you do n't make that animated , you will get swallowed up and then i would just be lost			0
so the movement is very calculated			0
it 's a very important part of bringing the character to life			2
" @entity194 tradition today , panto is seen as a uniquely @entity28 tradition , but it was n't always the case			1
" pantomime as we know it now really emerges in the second half of the 19th century , " said @entity97			0
" the original pantomimes had an opening scene , generally a fairy tale , with characters which wore these big masks and were often quite satirical of contemporary politics or events			0
" when @entity211 writer @entity210 began writing about @entity28 and pantomime , the two became cemented in the national psyche , with panto even spreading to other @entity216 nations			1
and with many @entity3 having @entity217 -- december 26 -- off work , it became an ideal time of year to enjoy the show			2
with the @entity54 and @entity56 now tackling panto , does that finally make it cool ? " i never knew it was n't , " says @entity53 .			1
