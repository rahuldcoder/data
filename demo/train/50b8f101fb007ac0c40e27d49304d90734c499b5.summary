@entity1 's " bachelor " @entity2 says he did not intend to slur homosexuals by saying they are " more pervert			1
" the @entity5 former soccer star blames his lack of @entity8 vocabulary for the misunderstanding when he was trying to explain why a gay or bisexual man should not be cast as a bachelor on the reality competition			1
@entity2 , in an apology posted on his @entity16 page saturday , said he meant to say that gay and bisexuals are too " affectionate and intense " for television			2
@entity21 network called his comments " careless , thoughtless and insensitive , " saying the opinions " in no way reflect the views of the network , the show 's producers or studio			1
" @entity2 made the comments in response to @entity34 writer @entity33 's question at a network party : " do you think it would be good at some point to have a gay or bisexual bachelor ? " he began by saying " i respect them , but honestly i do n't think it 's a good example for kids to watch that on tv			1
" " i respect that 100 % , " he said , before launching into a rambling response about how " now there 's fathers having kids and all that , and it is hard for me to understand that , too , in the sense of a household having peoples			0
two parents sleeping in the same bed and the kid going into bed , and you know it 's confusing in a sense			0
but i respect them because they want to have kids			0
they want to be parents			0
so it is a scale			0
where do you put it on the scale ? where 's the thin line to cross or not ? you have to respect everybody 's desires , opinions and way of living			0

" but the comment that caused the most uproar was : " there 's this thing about gay people			2
it seems to me , you know , and i do n't know if i 'm mistaken or not			0
i have a lot of friends like that , but they 're more pervert in a sense and to me the show will be too strong , too hard to watch on tv			2

" in fact , he said , " one of my closest friends " who is gay is " like a brother			2
" " the word pervert was not what i meant to say and i am very sorry about it , " he said			1
" everyone knows @entity8 is my second language and my vocabulary is not as broad as it is in @entity111 and , because of this , sometimes i use the wrong words to express myself			1
what i meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense and for a segment of the tv audience this would be too racy to accept			2
