former @entity1 dictator @entity0 was found guilty of the genocide of more than 1,700 indigenous @entity3 during his 1982 - 83 rule			1
a three - judge panel issued the verdict friday , one day after the conclusion of the trial			0
the court sentenced @entity0 , 86 , to 80 years in prison			1
the trial marked the first time a head of state has been tried for genocide by his country 's own judicial system			2
@entity17 , the tribunal 's president , read a lengthy review of how the judges reached their verdict before announcing it			0
the dozens of @entity25 witnesses proved that the military killed , tortured and raped the indigenous population			0
as de facto president , @entity0 knew atrocities were being committed and did nothing to stop it , @entity17 said			1
@entity0 's co-defendant and intelligence chief , @entity32 , was absolved			1
@entity1 confronts a dark chapter the court ordered the former leader go straight to prison , revoking his house arrest			1
a conclusion of the trial seemed in doubt in the past weeks , as the defense filed multiple challenges in several courts			0
at one point , one judge annulled the testimony in the trial before it got back on track			0
" it 's historic for this country , " @entity1 political analyst @entity49 told @entity50 en @entity51			2
" surprising , because many of us remain incredulous that @entity1 's judicial system could handle a trial of this magnitude			1
" the landmark criminal trial could open the doors for future charges against military officials accused of atrocities during @entity1 's 36 - year civil war			2
the war did not end until 1996 , leaving more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million as refugees			0
there will almost certainly be an appeal to friday 's verdict , @entity49 said			0
@entity1 president @entity71 , who has said that there was no genocide during the civil war , reiterated his position following the verdict			1
" today 's ruling is not set in stone , " @entity71 told @entity50 en @entity51 , referring to the expected appeals			0
his view on genocide is personal , and his government will respect the outcome of the legal system , he said			2
@entity71 's view has an added importance because during the @entity0 trial , one former soldier implicated him as having ordered attacks on villages during his time as a military commander			1
" when i say that here in @entity1 there is no genocide , i say it from my experiences " as commander , he said , denying that there was a conflict of interest in his publicizing his opinion			1
the important thing to recognize in the verdict , @entity71 said , is that the judicial system is working in ways it never has before			0
a trial and conviction of genocide for a former head of state " was unthinkable just 10 years ago , " he said			2
while @entity0 was in power , the military used the threat of leftist rebels as a guise to exterminate @entity25 villages accused of harboring insurgents , prosecutors argued			2
prosecutors said the campaign led to the genocide of more than 1,700 @entity3			0
@entity0 did not speak in his defense until the last day of the trial , arguing that it was not he , but local commanders , who had control over their territories			2
" i never authorized , i never signed , i never proposed , i never ordered these attacks against a people , ethnicity or religion , " @entity0 said thursday			0
the former dictator was not without his supporters , who claim there was no genocide , but a high cost during a bloody civil war			0
human rights groups hailed the verdict			0
" with this conviction , @entity1 leads by example in a region where entrenched impunity for past crimes sadly remains the norm , " @entity143 , @entity1 researcher at @entity144 , said			1
" @entity1 must now follow up on this historic moment by ensuring that all those who took part in the murder , torture , rape and disappearance of tens of thousands of people are brought to justice			2
" the verdict also has implications for the @entity163 ' role in @entity1 during @entity0 's rule			1
when @entity0 became president , human rights violations had already prompted the @entity163 to cut off aid to the @entity1 government			1
but a political scandal in the @entity163 in the 1990s revealed that in fact the @entity170 continued to provide money to @entity1 military intelligence sources for years during the civil war			1
now - declassified secret @entity170 cables indicate the @entity163 had knowledge of the atrocities being committed against the @entity3 but did little about them			0
then - @entity163 president @entity178 went as far as to say that @entity0 was being given a " bum rap " by critics			1
at the same time , the @entity163 was backing other strongmen in @entity182 against leftists			0
responding to friday 's verdict , the @entity184 noted the importance of a " strong and transparent justice system as an essential component of democracy , " according to a statement from spokesman @entity191			1
" we see an opportunity for progress toward a true reconciliation in @entity1 , an essential step for the @entity1 people to continue moving forward as everyone hopes , " @entity191 said .			0
