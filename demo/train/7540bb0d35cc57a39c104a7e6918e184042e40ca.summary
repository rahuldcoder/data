@entity1 's run of four successive victories ended on sunday , but the @entity4 's remarkable drive in @entity5 kept him in pole position to become @entity8 's youngest triple world champion			1
after being disqualified from saturday 's qualifying due to a technical infringement , the @entity10 star was allowed to start from the pit lane -- but still managed to finish third after one of the most chaotic races this season			1
his heroic showing overshadowed @entity19 's first victory since 2009 , and ended the @entity21 's slim hopes of a second world title ahead of the final two races			1
@entity1 's lead was cut by three points to 10 as main rival @entity26 finished second for @entity27 , and the @entity28 said he was happy after improving from sixth on the starting grid			1
latest @entity8 standings " we were not super competitive this weekend			0
we had to fight through the laps , then we had a good strategy that gave us a chance for the victory , but second was the maximum , " @entity26 said			2
the top three benefited by the withdrawal of @entity38 , who seemed set for his first victory since @entity41 in september as he raced clear			0
however , the 2008 world champion suffered yet another mechanical problem as his @entity44 developed fuel pressure problems -- it was the second time in five races the @entity48 has retired while leading			0
i feel certain we could have won , " said @entity38 , who will switch to the @entity50 team next year			2
" i was just entering a corner and the car just died on me			0
i was cruising and still pulling away when i had my problem			0
" @entity1 's hopes seemed bleak early in the race after he twice made contact with other cars and suffered minor damage -- but that was nothing compared to the scrapes in which his @entity10 teammate @entity63 was involved			1
the safety car was called out twice , which worked in @entity1 's favor , and @entity63 failed to finish after tangles with @entity68 ' @entity67 and @entity27 's @entity69 and then a terminal shunt from @entity72 's @entity71 which also took out @entity74 ' @entity73			1
" the second safety car helped , then i had a nice fight with @entity77 ( @entity78 )			0
it was a thrilling grand prix , up and down all the time , " said @entity1 , who won in @entity5 in 2009 - 10 but retired last year with his second world title already in the bag			1
" there are still two races to go			0
we saw how things can change yesterday			0
there was a chance we could screw it up , but we did n't do that			0
" @entity63 's @entity89 meant that @entity10 will have to wait another race before clinching a third successive manufacturers ' title -- holding a lead of 82 points over @entity27 with 86 still on offer			1
@entity96 helped @entity44 stay third as he finished fourth ahead of @entity67 , while @entity98 driver @entity97 improved his hopes of another season at @entity72 by placing sixth			0
@entity69 , who has had his @entity27 contract extended by another year , was seventh ahead of @entity103 -- who gave @entity68 a second driver in the top 10 despite an early collision with @entity72 - bound @entity107			2
@entity109 's @entity108 was ninth after his teammate @entity107 's early exit while @entity112 's @entity111 -- who earned @entity1 's anger after causing him front - wing damage -- was 10th			1
@entity19 , the 2007 world champion , delivered @entity74 ' first victory this season as he continued a consistent return to @entity8 that has put him third in the overall standings -- but now 57 points behind @entity1 with only 50 points available			1
" it 's been a hard season , not an easy time , but hopefully this gives us more belief , " said @entity19 , who will stay at @entity74 for the second year of his contract			2
" i hope this can turn the tables and give us many more wins , if not this year then for next year			2

@entity19 wins @entity131 but @entity1 retains overall lead
@entity1 finishes third despite starting the race from pit lane due to qualifying infringement
his main title rival @entity26 cuts the gap to 10 points by finishing second
@entity1 's @entity10 team must wait to clinch manufacturers ' title after @entity63 does not finish
