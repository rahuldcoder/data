-- @entity2 entrepreneur @entity1 is a great believer in the adage " you 've got to speculate to accumulate			1
" which goes some way to explaining why he 's prepared to enter the dollar - draining world of @entity9 -- and expects to make money			1
tthe 61 - year - old @entity12 team owner has been motoring on with his plans to build his brand new @entity15 from scratch to join the grid in 2016			1
as the founder of @entity19 , he sees @entity9 's global world championship as the perfect shop window for his billion dollar machine tool manufacturing business			1
" if i can achieve an extra billion in sales , we will pay for whatever @entity9 costs , " the @entity23 told @entity0 's @entity24			2
" some teams spend half a billion , some spend 50 million dollars a year , " as @entity1 did the maths			0
" we should be somewhere in the middle of that			0
" @entity1 has taken note of @entity34 's success in @entity9 , a team that has won four straight world titles in the 10 years since @entity38 tycoon @entity37 , the co-founder of the energy drink company , bought and revamped the @entity41 race team			1
" just the association of being with @entity9 basically takes a brand from nobody to the stratosphere , " said @entity1 , whose team will be based in @entity43 , @entity44 , though it will have an overseas office close to @entity46 , @entity47			1
however , a concern for @entity1 must be that @entity9 's most recent start - ups have enduring mixed fortunes			1
of the three teams who joined @entity9 when the grid was expanded to 12 teams in 2010 , only @entity55 and @entity56 remain in business			2
the @entity63 hrt team quit the sport because of lack of funding at the end of 2012 , while @entity55 and @entity56 are still battling to survive from the back of the grid , with the future of both teams far from certain			0
" i think their biggest problem was trying to get to the grid so fast , " argued @entity1			2
" for us we want to make sure that before the cars come for practice in january 2016 , we will have that chassis hopefully completely assembled by november			0
" we will spend a fair amount of time making sure we have the right spares , the right pit equipment , the right logistics , the right containers -- all the right things that takes us to get to the race			0
" having started his own @entity12 team in 2003 , @entity1 joined forces with three - time @entity90 champion @entity89 to form the successful @entity92 team in 2009			1
if @entity12 taught @entity1 anything it is that the right connections are essential to motorsport success			1
hence his @entity9 team has already signed a technical partnership with @entity99 , the most successful team in the history of the sport			1
the agreement means the @entity104 marque will supply the @entity1 team with hybrid engines and gearboxes as well as general technical support			2
" it 's the people that you partner with , " responds @entity1 , when asked what he learned from setting up his @entity12 team from the bottom up			1
" @entity99 wanted to go beyond being just an engine supplier and they were going to help us with the basic structures of the car			0
" it 's an honor to have @entity99 help us in this way and we take all the help they can give us because you ca n't really get better than @entity99			0
" @entity1 was at the @entity104 @entity125 , where rumors also swirled about the concept of @entity9 's major marques -- the likes of @entity99 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity34 -- running three - car teams , an idea that would potentially see minnows like the @entity135 knocked off the grid			1
" i 'm ready for a @entity9 with eight teams with three cars each , " @entity9 supremo @entity137 told @entity104 newspaper @entity138 in an interview : but the implacable @entity1 says he is not worried that his eponymous @entity9 team wo n't have a place on the grid if @entity137 's idea comes to fruition			1
" we have a license , we will be there , " @entity1 insisted			0
" unless something changes that would be a shock to me			0
" i think @entity137 's objective is to have teams who are well - structured , well - funded and that race at a level that the world championship requires			1
" so @entity1 continues to focus on overseeing the first @entity2 - based @entity9 team to compete at the elite level of global motorsport since 1986			1
a bid by the @entity163 team to join the grid in 2010 ended ignominiously because of a lack of funding			0
@entity2 dream @entity9 still lags behind the domestic @entity12 and @entity169 series when it comes to audience share			1
however the reintroduction of the @entity2 @entity125 in 2012 on a new circuit in @entity174 in 2012 has helped grow the sport 's popularity			2
" i tell ya , an @entity2 team with an @entity2 driver would be simply hitting it out of the ball park as far as the media would be concerned , " enthused @entity1			1
" we would love to do that but it 's a bit too early to try and predict that			0
it would be great to have fellow @entity2 behind us and supporting us , that would be a tremendous push for us			0
" if winning over homegrown motorsport fans is a long - term aim -- not to forget the plans to double the turnover of the @entity1 business -- then the short - term goal for the @entity23 car enthusiast is much more prosaic			2
" the first five years is about just surviving , " @entity1 says			2
" i do n't have any grander expectations that we are going to go there and win championships			0
" if we can even win one race in five years that would be a tremendous success			0
" given @entity56 have only won two points -- thanks to stricken driver @entity206 's ninth - place finish in @entity207 this season -- and @entity55 are yet to score a point , a grand prix victory for the @entity135 would be success indeed			1
hammer time do n't bet against it happening though with @entity1 at the helm			2
" i 've been tinkering with cars most of my life , since i was 10 years old , " adds @entity1			2
" i always had this flavor , this attitude ' yeah i think i can do that a little bit better			0
' " i just never give up and keep trying , trying and trying			0
i just keep hammering away			0
" if you keep doing something long enough , you learn how to do it and i do n't think @entity9 is any different			0
" it 's just a challenge			0
certainly the biggest challenge of my career but i do n't have any doubts we can do it			1
you just do n't give up			0

@entity1 wants to *bolster* business brand by founding a @entity9 team
the @entity2 's @entity135 is *due* to join the world championship in 2016
@entity1 , who owns a @entity12 team , wants to win a grand prix within the first five years
" @entity9 is the biggest challenge of my career but i do n't have any doubts we can do it , " he says
