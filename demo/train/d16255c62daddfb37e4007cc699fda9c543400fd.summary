-- the number of @entity3 's so - called " baby hatches " -- places where mothers can leave newborn babies anonymously -- is set to increase as the government tries to protect more of the country 's abandoned infants			1
the hatches , which were first introduced in @entity11 , the capital of @entity3 's northeastern @entity13 province in 2011 , consist of a temperature - controlled room equipped with a baby 's cradle and an incubator			1
once dropped off anonymously , an alarm is sounded and a welfare worker attends to the child minutes later			2
there are currently 25 baby hatches in 10 provinces across @entity3 , and the @entity24 ( @entity25 ) told state media agency @entity26 that more will be set up , in a further 18 regions			1
a mr. @entity28 from the @entity29 told @entity0 that they plan to open a baby hatch within the year and the project is one of the department 's top priorities			2
children are often given up due to disability or severe illness -- largely to parents without the necessary means to provide for their offspring -- and historically , due to the sex of the child in a country where boys are traditionally favored and strict one - child policies have put pressure on families to produce male heirs			2
while statistics point to a largely even split between boys and girls , almost all the infants given up at baby hatches suffer from disabilities or severe illness			1
proponents of the system say that the " baby safety islands " , as they are officially known in @entity3 , significantly reduce the mortality rates of abandoned babies , providing a safe , warm environment with immediate care and improving on the wretched conditions that infants are often left in			1
according to the code of conduct released by @entity67 , the facilities should issue an announcement to look for the baby 's parents			2
the baby will be adopted into a child welfare institution -- a state orphanage -- if it is not claimed by parents or legal guardians after the announcement has expired			2
the baby hatch system is not without its detractors , however			0
some in the country criticize the policy , saying that it could encourage parents to give up unwanted infants			0
the practice is also used in various countries around the world , including in @entity88			0
in countries like @entity90 " babyklappe " are also considered controversial -- and inhabiting a legal gray area thanks to new laws that protect children 's rights to know their mother 's identity -- but have been used relatively infrequently			0
since opening in late january , a baby hatch in the southern city of @entity99 has received almost 80 infants , according to a @entity26 report cited in the party - funded english - language @entity102			1
a @entity106 report said a baby hatch in @entity108 was " crowded with visitors			0
" the owner of a nearby convenience store told @entity106 that she saw parents drop babies off at the facility every day			0
@entity115 , head of the @entity25 , says that there is no evidence to show that baby hatches lead to an increase in child abandonment , and that the service should be viewed as a practical move			1
" laws emphasize prevention , while baby hatches focus on rescue after the laws are broken , " he said			1
the original baby hatch in @entity11 reported a comparable number of infants abandoned in 2009 - 10 to that recorded since the service was established in june 2011			1
" i do n't think the baby hatches would encourage people to abandon their babies , " population expert at the @entity139 @entity138 said			1
" @entity108 is an individual case			0
the story has been exaggerated			0
its impact is waiting to be seen , it 's too soon to judge			0
" the efficacy of the baby hatches aside , the number of abandoned infants in @entity3 does , for some critics , point to deficiencies in @entity3 's welfare system , especially for children born with illnesses or disabilities			1
a comprehensive system that goes far beyond the immediate care offered by baby hatches should be a priority , according to @entity160 , who runs a @entity163 legal aid and study center for adolescents			1
" we need a comprehensive system to better protect them , " he is quoted as saying			0
@entity25 's @entity115 says a medical insurance system , reinforcing other support mechanisms , should be implemented			0
recent moves to relax @entity3 's strict one - child policy may also positively affect abandonment numbers in the country			1
the program is attracting debate on @entity3 social media as well			2
" it 's good for the babies , but the most important issue now is where would they go when they grow up , " said one @entity178 user			0
" is it a sign to legal [ ize ] abandoning babies ? " asked another			0
@entity0 's @entity188 contributed to this report			0

@entity3 's " baby hatches " provide a safe environment for people to anonymously abandon infants
supporters say the program significantly improves mortality rates of abandoned infants
some critics see hatches as band - aid to overall *problems* with @entity3 's welfare laws
