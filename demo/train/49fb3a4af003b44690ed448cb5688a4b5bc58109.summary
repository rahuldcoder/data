@entity0 -- the actress ' appearances on the silver screen transformed men with hearts of stone into quivering masses during @entity10 's @entity9			2
on tuesday night , the simple fact that they were once worn by @entity13 transformed the silver , the stones and the gold themselves -- into fortunes			1
if the prices commanded by @entity25 's auction house are any indication , the @entity22 - @entity21 actress ' luster appears to have rubbed off on the jewels she once wore			2
the items in her collection rocketed far beyond their original estimates			0
for example , the 50 - carat pearl known as @entity32 , given to her in 1969 by actor @entity34 and once part of the crown jewels of @entity37 , went for $ 11.8 million , which @entity25 said was the highest recorded price ever of pearl jewelry sold at auction			1
its value had been estimated at $ 2 million to $ 3 million			1
the pearl was mounted onto a specially commissioned diamond - and - ruby @entity47 necklace			1
a diamond tiara given to @entity13 by her husband , @entity50 , estimated at $ 80,000 pre-auction brought in a surprising $ 4.2 million			1
the @entity52 , an @entity54 diamond and jade pendant sold for $ 8.8 million			1
its initial estimate was a range of $ 300,000 - $ 500,000			1
an emerald and diamond necklace went for $ 6.1 million			1
and the sale of the @entity62 fetched $ 8.8 million more , capping a spectacular night of bidding that included other jewelry			1
the auction continues through friday with sales of clothing and film memorabilia			0
more than 400 people filled the bidder seats and more than a dozen @entity25 staffers were on the phone with buyers			0
before the bidding started , the auction house played a two - minute video showing clips from some of @entity13 's movies , including " @entity81 , " " @entity82 " and " who 's afraid of @entity84			1
" also included was an undated clip showing the actress clad in a white swimsuit at poolside , her head wrapped in a towel , bidding for jewelry by phone			0
" it 's now $ 120,000 , " says an unidentified male voice from the other end of the line			2
" do you want me to bid ? " " yes ! " says @entity13 , holding a cigarette , then leaning into the speakerphone			1
" @entity100 , it sounds like things that are really desirable are going to go for 10 times what expected , right ? " " that 's the way it works , " a male voice responds from the other end of the line			0
" holy cow ! " she says			0
at that , the @entity25 's audience breaks into laughter and applause			0
her dazzling collection of jewels , many of which were given to her as presents by husbands , were referred to in september -- as the auction was being planned -- by @entity121 , deputy chairman of @entity122 , as " the crown jewels of @entity10			0
" @entity124 , head of the jewelry department at @entity25 , said then that @entity13 's taste in jewels was " extraordinarily refined			1
she really understood her gemstones ( and ) she had a passion for design and workmanship , quite a rare combination			0
" according to @entity133 , co-author of the book " @entity135 : @entity13 , @entity34 , @entity139 , " @entity13 developed her taste for jewels from a young age			2
" her father was an art and antiques dealer , " @entity133 said			0
but it was n't until @entity13 's marriage to @entity50 that her passion for collecting serious jewels took hold , @entity133 said in september			2
@entity50 , @entity13 's third husband , bought her a 29.4 - carat diamond ring as well as a diamond tiara , which she wore to the 1957 @entity151			1
@entity133 believes that when @entity34 bought @entity13 the 33.19 - carat @entity152 in 1968 -- possibly the star piece in the exhibition at @entity25 , estimated to fetch between $ 2.5 million and $ 3.5 million -- he was trying to out - do @entity50 , who had died unexpectedly just over a year into his marriage with @entity13			1
" i think that was a big deal for @entity34 , to buy her a diamond as big as @entity50 's			2
and he liked showing that the son of a @entity163 coal - miner could buy his lady love these extravagant jewels , " she said			2
the actress , who died this year at age 79 , eulogized her love of gems in her 2002 memoir , " @entity171			0
" in it , she wrote : " i never , never thought of my jewelry as trophies			0
i 'm here to take care of them and to love them			0
when i die and they go off to auction i hope whoever buys them gives them a really good home			0
" in memory of the actress 's life - long devotion to humanitarian causes , a portion of profits generated by admissions , events and select publications related to the sales will be donated to the @entity194 ( @entity195 ) , which she set up in 1991			2
@entity1 's @entity196 contributed to this report			0
