-- this might be the start of a new chapter in the browser wars			1
over the weekend , @entity5 routed more internet traffic than @entity8 's @entity7 , which long has held its spot as the most - used web browser in the world , according to data from @entity13 , an internet monitor			1
do n't rush to over-interpret this bit of news , though			0
other internet trackers still show internet explorer -- which comes pre-installed on many @entity20 computers and has long been a default -- in the lead			0
and some groups have criticized @entity13 's data collection methods , saying the group does not account for the different ways countries collect @entity7 traffic data			2
still , the numbers are a sign of the times			0
bonjour @entity32 ! @entity33 adds auto - translation @entity5 , which is regarded as the hipper , faster and more developer - friendly browser , is gaining ground on the competition			1
" whether @entity5 can take the lead in the browser wars in the long term remains to be seen , however the trend towards @entity5 usage at weekends is undeniable , " @entity13 's ceo @entity39 said in a written news release in march , when @entity5 bested @entity7 for a day			1
" at weekends , when people are free to choose what browser to use , many of them are selecting @entity5 in preference to @entity7			1
" according to @entity13 's latest report , which was spotted by the blog @entity51 , @entity5 fielded 32.8 % of web page requests on sunday			1
that compares to 31.9 % for @entity7 and 25.5 % for @entity55 , which once was seen as the most viable alternative to the long - dominant @entity7 tech blog @entity57 says the numbers are n't exact but they are significant			2
" measuring the @entity60 is an imprecise science , very often based on scaling up small scale measurement surveys , " the blog writes , " but the gist of @entity13 's data over the last year indicates that @entity5 use is rising ... at the expense of @entity7 and @entity55 , regardless of the exact precision of the data			1
" @entity70 , another company that tracks internet traffic , does not release comparable numbers			0
but spokesman @entity73 said in an e-mail that @entity13 's numbers are " consistent with what i 've seen			0
" " @entity5 has definitely been increasing its share over the past couple years , " he wrote			0
several factors appear to contribute to @entity5 's rise			2
one is frustration with @entity8 's @entity7 , which , fairly or not , is seen by some web users as not very innovative			1
another is the increasing role @entity5 plays in all aspects of computing , especially for people who use @entity32 's other online services , like @entity33 and @entity88			1
some of the browser 's features enhance other @entity32 products , and the @entity92 is home to an increasingly robust catalog of add - ons that improve the browser 's functionality			2
@entity0 's partner site @entity99 has published a list of some of the best			0
@entity32 also has tried to position the browser as the basis for the operating system of the future			0
