on @entity19 on tuesday , medicaid chief @entity20 , whose job it was to oversee the october 1 rollout of the website , said she did not foresee its problems			1
" no , we had tested the website and we were comfortable with its performance , " she said			2
" now , like i said , we knew all along there would be as with any new website , some individual glitches we would have to work out			2

and did not show up in testing			0
" @entity20 : sorry for problems , but system working 5 things we learned from tuesday 's hearing but the @entity9 document , which describes " top risks currently open " and " outstanding issues currently being mitigated " says the testing timeframes are " not adequate to complete full functional , system , and integration testing activities " and lists the impact of the problems as " significant			1

@entity15 : what works and what does n't ? @entity9 had no comment other than to confirm authenticity of the report that also gave " the highest priority " and warns " we do n't have access to monitoring tools " and " hub services are intermittently unavailable " -- short for the " site 's not working sometimes			1
" one concern , listed as " severe , " warned , " @entity9 does not have access to necessary tools to manage envs in test , imp , and prod			2

" what 's been done , what needs to be done , what needs to be resolved			0
it is misleading to cherry pick a few lines , " he said , adding that the report identified issues and " we worked to address those issues and all issues identified			1
" it is not clear if a later report detailed that the issues were resolved			1
