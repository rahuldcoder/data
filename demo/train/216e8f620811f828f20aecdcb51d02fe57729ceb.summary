@entity0 -- the @entity2 , aka @entity2 , might not be the @entity4 's key to electoral victory as once thought			1
patterns are emerging that @entity4 and like - minded groups are broadening their scope and not homing in on a singular @entity10 message			1
in march , @entity11 , head of the @entity12 , told @entity1 's @entity13 that @entity2 is " complete poison " and advised @entity12 candidates they " have to hit your main target which is @entity2 " in order to win			1
but in the political world , things change fast , and @entity20 is the equivalent to a millennium ago			0
@entity23 leader @entity23 , who is in a reelection bid against surprisingly strong @entity26 @entity25 , recently said that while he wants to repeal the law , @entity29 's version , @entity30 , is " unconnected " to the fate of @entity2			1
@entity30 is relatively popular in @entity29 , providing insurance coverage to more than 413,000 people , but was created under the @entity2 and is funded mostly through federal funds			1
@entity36 's shift is subtle but meaningful			0
during his primary campaign against a candidate who billed himself as more conservative than @entity36 , the @entity38 leader took a hard - line stance on getting rid of -- or repealing -- @entity2 , which has been the @entity12 mantra until recently			1
he 's not the only one			0
@entity44 , which is expected to spend north of $ 100 million this election cycle backing issues that @entity4 favor , has also shifted its strategy			0
in the lead up to the launch of @entity2 last fall , during its disastrous rollout and in the months after , @entity47 had a laser - like focus on the issue , spending tens of millions of dollars in states and districts where @entity56 are vulnerable			1
2014 primaries : what 's at stake " we do want to make sure that @entity2 is the @entity62 issue in the country , " @entity47 president @entity60 said in february			1
at that time , the law had been in effect for less than two months , it was lagging behind its target enrollment pace and the effects of a bad roll out still permeated			2
@entity60 said @entity2 is going to be the top issue because the " tidal wave affects are going to continue with @entity2			1
" furthermore , a march 15 statement on the organization 's website described itself as the " nation 's foremost advocate for health care freedom			0
" but now , two months later , @entity47 has broadened its scope			0
its website now features a campaign against the @entity81 , which is not related to @entity2			1
also , an ad airing in @entity83 , where @entity56 sen. @entity84 is locked in a tight reelection race , attacks her for " wasteful government spending			0
" missing from the ad -- the word " @entity2			2
" in addition , its partner group , @entity88 , launched an $ 850,000 ad buy in @entity91 earlier this week that focuses on taxes and also does n't mention the o - word			0
@entity47 does n't deny it			0
" we 're responding to the changing environment , " @entity47 spokesman @entity94 said			0
" that initial shock ( of @entity2 ) has changed a little bit , but it has n't gone away			2
" @entity4 are now retooling their message , after having emerged from primary battles of who 's farther to the right they must now try to appeal to a more diverse audience that has become more accepting of the federal health care program approved in 2010 without @entity12 support			2
polling suggests that public attitudes are shifting			1
the latest @entity1 poll from early may found that 38 % of people wanted to either replace the law or get rid of it			2
the results are similar to a @entity116 poll which found 35 % of respondents said the law needs to be repealed , which is a far better billing than the 43 % who felt the same way in november			0
@entity120 with the @entity121 , a nonpartisan polling group , wrote that @entity4 are starting to use the word " fix " in their campaigning , instead of " repeal			2
" " republicans have been gearing up for months ... to run against @entity2 , then it started to work , " @entity128 , spokesman for the @entity129 said , noting that 8 million people have signed up			1
since @entity4 gained control of the @entity132 in 2011 , they voted more than 50 times on a full or partial repeal of the health care law , that 's more than one vote per month , but the pace has fallen off dramatically in recent months			1
2014 key races to watch that matters because in an election year , congressional business is connected to electoral politics as lawmakers want to either promote their agenda or tarnish the other party			0
but @entity94 predicts the issue will not go away , especially as the elections approach and new premium rates are announced this fall			0
" our role is going to be to remind folks how we got here in the first place , " he said .			0
