-- when it comes to negotiating a salary for a new job it can pay to ask for a precise figure			1
new research has suggested that asking for an amount that is less " round " -- like $ 105,000 instead of $ 100,000 -- increases the final outcome			2
the idea is that precise numbers give recruiters the impression a candidate has thoroughly researched the job			1
" it matters because round numbers seem less informed			1
people who use them seem like they have n't really done their homework , or they 're just sort of being arbitrary , " said @entity17 , an associate professor at @entity18 , who led the study			0
she says the perception that a number came out of nowhere leads negotiation counterparts to be more aggressive in their counteroffers , which translates into worse outcomes for people who make round offers , compared with people who make precise offers			1
" @entity34 numbers are just one way to communicate to people ' do n't mess with me ' or ' i 'm informed , i 'm not just throwing some number out there , ' " @entity33 said			1

@entity33 says actually doing the calculations of how much to ask for , to back up the offer amount , is " far more important " than simply using the precise numbers recommended by the study			1
candidates may figure out the going rates for the jobs from websites or by asking someone within the company who would be open to telling you			2
@entity60 , author of " i will teach you to be @entity70 , " offers courses on negotiation using techniques based on his own experience , real - world data from his students and tests that he runs			0
he says that doing relevant research , and then giving the perception that you have reasons for the dollar figure sought , is the most important part of negotiation			1
" when you walk into a room , you should already know not only the pay range of your job , but you should have it documented and printed out and ready to present , " @entity60 said			2
good negotiators should be able to justify why they should be paid the higher end of that range , @entity60 said			1
it involves explaining one 's experience , knowing the company 's challenges and letting the recruiters know how you can solve their problems			2

" it shows what they would do in 30 , 60 , 90 days			0
and when you do this people 's jaws drop			0
and when that happens , five or ten thousand dollars ' raise in negotiation is almost trivial			0
it 's almost beside the point , because you 're showing how much value you can add to the company , " he said			0
@entity33 points out that there are broad benefits to providing reasons in a salary negotiation			2
not only does it help convince the recruiter of the candidate 's worth , but it gives the recruiter material to back up the decision			0
" people do n't like being told ' it 's my way or the highway			0
' people like to have reasons , " she says			0
" what you want to do in a negotiation is have your counterpart understand why that number that you 're suggesting makes sense , so that he or she can explain to herself why it makes sense , so she can go explain to the rest of her company or the rest of her team why it makes sense			0

in negotiations , there is an *advantage* to offering a figure that is not a round number
@entity34 numbers give recruiters the impression that the candidate has thoroughly researched the job
but actually researching the job is more important , experts say
good negotiators should be able to justify a high salary
