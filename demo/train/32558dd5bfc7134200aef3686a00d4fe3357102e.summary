-- one is the loneliest number			0
two can be as bad as one			0
and three , well ... um ... what was three again ? three is hard			2
i 'll start by quoting the silence heard around the political world during wednesday night 's @entity9 @entity8 presidential debate			1
here were @entity12 gov. @entity11 's words in the middle of one of his answers : " i will tell you : it 's three agencies of government , when i get there , that are gone : @entity20 , @entity21 and the -- what 's the third one there ? let 's see			1
@entity26 and the -- ... the third agency of government i would -- i would do away with the education , the ... commerce and -- let 's see -- i ca n't			2
the third one , i ca n't			0
" oops ? oops ? did he just say oops on camera ? watch @entity11 try to name the three agencies that was his comeback			1
@entity11 completed this painful journey not by telling the audience that remembering the third point was n't as important as remembering his overall message			1
he did n't tell the audience that forgetting his third point in a debate was not as bad as forgetting how to run the country or fix the economy			2
he simply said , " oops			0
" and then the microphone went to one of his seven @entity8 rivals			1
you might say that blunders happen in debates			0
after all , @entity11 is not the first , nor will he be the last , to have a mental lapse in a debate			1
remember @entity59 's @entity58 gubernatorial debate last year ? when she appeared to have lost her train of thought in her opening statement and for about 15 seconds could only smile and laugh nervously as cameras rolled ? that was one of the worst moments ever in a debate , and she still won the election			1
so the question is : how much damage will @entity11 's gaffe do ? it will do major damage			1
first , i 've been evaluating debates for 20 years , and can tell you -- if you doubted it for a second -- that @entity11 's mental block was very , very bad			1
one reason is that the question he was asked at the time was n't even about cutting agencies			0
it was about how he could work with @entity85 across the aisle			0
but @entity11 wanted to add some flair , so he looked at @entity88 in order to brag about how he would cut three different agencies ( although still not as many as @entity88 's five ) and then gave himself the self - induced wound			1
what then made it worse was that @entity11 was asked twice if he could remember the third agency and he continued to draw a blank			1
whatever credibility he had disappeared like his memory			0
it was a perfect example of a gotcha question , which everyone from @entity101 to @entity102 complains about -- except that nobody even asked it			0
@entity11 did the gotcha on himself			2
the more damning reason his mistake will hurt in the long run is because it gives the audience a consistent ( and unfavorable ) impression of @entity11			1
one of the things i tell my communications classes is that people cling to first impressions			0
it 's why first impressions are so difficult to overcome , especially if they are negative			0
unfortunately , if you have been watching these @entity8 presidential debates , your first impression , along with that of many other viewers , is that @entity11 does not have the best grasp of the issues and he has a difficult time answering questions			1
fair or not , this may turn people away from voting for him			0
lately the entire focus of @entity11 's team has been trying to change the public 's first impression of their candidate			1
they believed these upcoming debates would help			0
after all , @entity11 could n't get any worse , right ? oops			2
it turns out he could			0
and since many in the public have an unfavorable first impression , @entity11 's performance fed right into that			1
because of his poor first impression , @entity11 was the candidate who could least afford a slip - up of this magnitude			2
instead of overcoming that negative first impression , he did the opposite			0
and @entity11 is anchored to them as he is falling into a deep @entity12 waterhole			2
up to now , @entity11 's cumulative debating performance has been pretty weak			1
i cringe every time i watch @entity11 give any answer , since my expectations are that he might forget what he is talking about or begin an undisciplined , meandering ramble and end up mumbling some nonsense under his breath			1
while he may never give another poor answer in a debate , i still expect it			2
and therein lies the problem			0
it has now become a lasting impression			0
some blunders can not be overcome			0
while @entity59 won her election , she was debating against a @entity170 when her poor debating performance occurred			0
republicans had no other choice but to vote for her or the @entity170			0
that 's not the case with @entity11			1
there are other @entity8 that voters will now begin to gravitate toward			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			2

@entity180 : @entity11 forgot what he was going to say in the middle of a debate answer
he says as debate gaffes go , this one was a *whopper* that will be hard for voters to forget
he says for many , it *confirmed* low expectations about @entity11 's grasp of issues
@entity180 : since voters have other @entity8 choices besides @entity11 , this mistake may be fatal
