@entity0 -- the @entity3 is collecting bulk records on international money transfers , using the same @entity7 legal authority that has become the center of controversy in @entity11 surveillance programs , a source told @entity1			1
a person familiar with the program said the agency 's efforts are an outgrowth of terror finance - tracking programs that were established in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks and revealed that @entity20 funded the hijackers using methods such as smuggled cash , money transfers , and credit and debit cards			1
the @entity27 and the @entity28 have other programs that similarly focus on financial transaction data			0
the @entity3 program provides some redundancies intended to catch transactions that may not draw attention in other programs			1
the @entity36 and the @entity37 first reported the existence of the @entity3 program thursday night , saying it has sparked concerns from lawmakers			2
the revelation comes amid debate in the @entity11 over whether to pare back some surveillance in light of privacy concerns raised after former @entity28 contractor @entity47 leaked documents describing secret spy programs			2
the @entity3 program focuses on transfers that the agency believes could be the source of terrorism financing and that use services such as @entity56 and @entity57			1
the vast majority are purely non- @entity11 transactions , but it includes some transactions to or from the @entity11			1
such @entity11 - related transactions could raise concerns about data of @entity11 people , which the @entity3 is generally prohibited from collecting			1
the court that oversees @entity69 has established legal rules governing the @entity3 program , as it has with @entity28 surveillance programs , and requires evidence of a connection to potential terrorism before data belonging to @entity11 people can be accessed , the person familiar with the program said			1
the agency works with the @entity77 to target potential financing of terrorism			0
a @entity11 intelligence official said any activity in such programs includes what the government calls " minimization procedures to protect @entity11 person information " and court - approved restrictions on specially trained analysts who can query the data , and on the length of time such data is allowed to be retained			1
the @entity3 said it does n't comment on " alleged intelligence sources or methods			1
" @entity95 , a @entity3 spokesman , said that " the @entity3 protects the nation and upholds the privacy rights of @entity11 by ensuring that its intelligence collection activities are focused on acquiring foreign intelligence and counterintelligence in accordance with @entity11 laws			1

" while the details of the @entity3 program provide new information on the scope of @entity7 bulk records collection , @entity11 government monitoring of financial transaction data has become well known since 9/11			1
the 9/11 attacks cost @entity20 between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 to carry out , according to the @entity152 , and the plotters transferred much of the money through readily detectable means via banks , money - transfers , travelers checks , and credit and debit cards			2
at the time , the financial transactions did n't raise any flags			0
among the transactions uncovered after the attacks were @entity56 and @entity57 money transfers , the commission said			0
