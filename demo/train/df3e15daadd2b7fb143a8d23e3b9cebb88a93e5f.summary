-- the economy and global affairs will undoubtedly play key roles in the 2012 election , but many voters may also be watching for candidates ' stances on more personal issues			1
@entity0 posed questions about several hot - button topics related to social issues , and @entity13 users responded enthusiastically ; some even got into feisty commenting debates			1
health care , immigration and same - sex marriage were three of the most popular topics			1
the readers shared their thoughts via the i 'm voting app , which asks potential voters how the president should handle key issues			1
this project , in partnership with @entity13 , aims to increase voter engagement ahead of the 2012 presidential election			1
click through the gallery for a look at respondents ' views , broken down by demographics gleaned from @entity13 profiles			1
party and age divisions showed more variation than in last week 's look at foreign policy views			1
but when looking at gender groups , as in frame 2 , the pie slices stayed remarkably consistent			1
health care question : should @entity46 be required to have health insurance ? @entity48 : " a heath care system that 's for profit is bs			1
they are not there for you			1
it 's about the board of directors and rather it 's making money			2
to me , that 's a dangerous system			2
if it were n't for the fact that federal law says that they must take you , only the rich would live long full lives			2
and it 's that way now			2
just not to the extreme it would be without that law			2
health care should not be for money			2
it should be for the people			2
" @entity76 : " doctors would n't go to college if it were n't to earn a good living			2
if @entity81 is such a great thing , why are @entity82 and the president not covered by it ? " 2			2
immigration question : should states be able to enact tougher immigration laws than the federal government ? @entity90 : " if the federal government wo n't enforce the existing laws , why not let the states control their own borders ? after all , it is costing the states way too much to continue supporting undocumented immigrants and their families			0
" @entity99 : " we seem to forget our history and keep making the same mistake over and over again			0
during @entity103 , we sent hundreds of @entity104 - @entity46 to concentration camps ! now we are doing the same to the undocumented immigrants , mainly the @entity107			0
i do n't hear as much about the @entity109			0
these undocumented aliens are the ones that make it possible for you and me to eat our vegetables			0
they do the jobs that we @entity46 deem beneath us			0
so please , instead of focusing on illegal immigrants , why do n't we focus on repairing our economy ? let 's put our priorities in order and remember that the immigrants were the ones that made this country great ! " 3			0
same - sex marriage question : should same - sex couples be able to marry ? @entity133 : " same - sex ( couples ) should be able to marry and get the same rights as everyone else , regardless of what state you live in , period			0
it does not matter what goes on in anyone 's bedroom but your own			0
" @entity143 : " sorry , i do n't care for the term same - sex marriage			0
as a @entity144 , i believe marriage is between a man and a woman			0
that is the definition of marriage to me			0
i do believe that those so inclined should have a right to a civil union or partnership , whatever , but that is not a marriage			0
i have gay friends and family members that i love very much , but i just ca n't go there			0
let them sign a contract or whatever and have the rights to health care and insurance , or to a divorce like the rest of us , @entity167			0
just leave marriage alone ! " other questions posed on the app were about gun control , gun laws and abortion			1
each of these questions received numerous comments			1
it 's important to note that -- unlike in scientific polls -- anyone from the online audience could respond			0
a relatively large percentage of respondents in the @entity13 surveys identified themselves as @entity185			1
the breakdown ( as of wednesday ) was 54 % @entity185 , 21 % @entity187 and 25 % independent			0
compare those numbers with a 2008 national exit poll showing 39 % @entity185 , 32 % @entity187 and 29 % independent			0
in 2010 , the breakdown was 35 % @entity185 , 35 % @entity187 and 29 % independent			0
there are still plenty of questions waiting to be asked , so readers are encouraged to participate			1
here 's how it works : users first declare their intention to vote and then answer a series of multiple - choice questions			1
they then can share their answers or compare responses with other @entity13 users			1
be sure to visit the app , where we 'll be posting new questions through @entity205			1
