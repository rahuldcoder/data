goodbye , free plastic toys inside @entity3 -- at least in one major @entity1 city			1
a new @entity5 law goes into effect on thursday that prevents fast - food restaurants from giving away trinkets , action figures and other toys in their kid 's meals unless their food meets nutritional requirements			1
parents who order happy meals at the 19 @entity18 's locations in @entity5 will have to request the toy and pay 10 cents			1
that amount will be donated to the @entity21 of @entity5			1
@entity22 , which has 13 restaurants in @entity5 , announced that it will also offer kids meals ' toys for 10 cents			1
@entity18 's kid 's meals do not meet the law 's nutritional standards			1
the meals have to be less than 600 calories and contain fruits ( a half - cup ) and vegetables ( 3/4 of a cup )			2
they must have less than 35 % of the total calories coming from fat , less than 640 milligrams of sodium and less than 0.5 milligrams of trans fat			0
the current @entity3 consisting of a hamburger , kid 's - size fries and a cola would meet the calorie , calories from fat , sodium and trans fat requirements under the @entity5 law			1
it would contain 500 calories , 125 calories from fat and 600 milligrams of sodium			0
but it would not meet the fruit and vegetable quota			0
the pickle and onion on the hamburger does not come near the required Â¾ cup of vegetables			0
the @entity65 fries do not count as a vegetable , according to the @entity67			0
the new law will affect about 50 fast - food restaurants in @entity5 such as @entity22 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
" our efforts are geared towards addressing childhood obesity epidemic , " said @entity72 and @entity74 @entity73 , who proposed the ordinance			1
about one - third of children in the @entity81 are either overweight or obese , according to data compiled by the @entity83			0
health advocates have long accused fast - food restaurants of enticing children to eat fast - food meals high in fat and sodium by using toys tied to characters in new movies			2
@entity18 's said in a statement : " while we will fully comply with this law , we also have a responsibility to give our customers what they want			1
" parents have told us they 'd still like the option of purchasing a toy separately for their child when they buy them a @entity104			2
" the announcement that the money from toys would go to charity was met by skepticism by @entity110 , a corporate watchdog group			0
" as @entity18 's long has , it is again using a charity that helps children get well to defend a practice that contributes to a range of diet - related conditions like diabetes			1
currently @entity18 's uses its contributions to the charity to defend the hundreds of millions it spends marketing its junk food brand to kids each year , " according to the group 's statement			1
the new ordinance has had a greater impact beyond @entity5 , @entity73 said			2
" we inspired other local cities , parent activists and health organizers to take up the issue too , " he said			0
" we started a national dialogue in @entity5			2
it has become a national issue			0
" similar initiatives have been proposed in @entity137 in an effort to curb childhood obesity			1
and @entity140 initially passed the ban early last year			0
@entity73 said he met with several franchise owners in the city regarding the ordinance			0
despite initial opposition to the law last year , he said that there 's growing awareness that having healthy options is good business practice			2
earlier this year , hamburger chain @entity151 announced it would discontinue kids ' toys in their meals for children			2
also this summer , @entity18 's announced that it would revamp its iconic @entity3 to contain healthier options			1
the meals will carry apple slices , reduced portion of @entity65 fries and a choice of beverage , including new fat - free chocolate milk and 1 % low - fat white milk , instead of defaulting to soda			2
the changes started in september and will spread nationwide by the end of march 2012			0
however , the new version of the @entity3 still does not meet the requirements of the @entity5 law			1
although the @entity5 law has been criticized as legislating health and nutrition , @entity73 said the responsibility ultimately falls on the parents			1
but , fast - food restaurants play a role and " benefit from the pester power of the kids of young ages , " he said			0
" it 's our job as a local legislator to protect public health , " he said			0
" nothing is more important than children 's health			0
" he said the momentum for this law came from pediatricians and mainly parents who live in the lowest income neighborhoods			0
" they were the main voices of our campaign , " he said			0
the long - term goal is to move children 's meals toward lower fat , sodium and calories , @entity73 said .			2
