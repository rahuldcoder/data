@entity0 , @entity1 -- senior police officers failed to pursue extensive intelligence that indicated a catholic priest was involved in one of @entity1 's worst terrorist attacks , an independent report concluded tuesday			1
nine people died and 30 were wounded july 31 , 1972 , when three bombs went off in the town of @entity12 , in @entity13			1
the first was a car bomb that had been parked outside a local pub. minutes later , bombs exploded outside a post office and a hotel , according to @entity22 state broadcaster @entity20			2
no one was ever charged in the case , but there have long been suspicions that a catholic priest was involved			1
tuesday 's report was issued by the @entity29 , an independent body that investigates complaints against the police			2
the report found that , rather than acting on the information about the priest 's possible involvement , the police sought the government 's help in dealing with the @entity39			1
the police then accepted the government 's " understanding " that was reported back to them , the report found			2
" the consequence of their acquiescence was that the investigation was further compromised , " wrote @entity44 , the police ombudsman			2
" the decision failed those who were murdered , injured , and bereaved in the bombing			1
the police officers who were working on the investigation were also undermined			0
" the priest at the center of the controversy was identified by the report as father @entity58 , who died in 1980			1
according to the ombudsman 's investigation , police had " extensive intelligence " after the bombing from which they concluded @entity65 worked for the @entity66 as its regional director of operations			1
police also knew of allegations he had been directly involved in both the @entity12 bombings and other terrorist incidents , the report found			1
that should have led the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) -- the police force in @entity1 at the time -- to pursue further investigation that could have either implicated or cleared the priest , the report said			1
a detective wanted to arrest @entity65 in the months after the bombing , but an assistant chief constable turned down that request , the report found			1
that senior officer then suggested to the government that it hold a meeting with @entity39 officials about the issue			0
a government official wrote to the @entity77 in december 1972 to say the secretary of state for @entity1 met with cardinal @entity94 to express " disgust " at the priest 's behavior , and that the cardinal said he knew the priest was a " very bad man			1
" the cardinal promised to see " what could be done " about the priest , including a possible transfer to another parish			1
then - chief constable @entity104 wrote back to say only that he had seen the letter about the meeting and preferred a transfer			0
@entity65 was moved to a parish in the @entity22 in late 1973			0
church records indicate that when questioned by his superiors , @entity65 denied involvement in terrorist activity , the report said			0
as a result of the way police handled the case , the report said , the priest 's denials were never tested			1
@entity44 , the ombudsman , said the decisions made by those in charge at the time have to be considered in the context of the time			0
he said 1972 was one of the worst years of violence in @entity1 and the arrest of a priest could have aggravated the security situation			1
without more information about why the police failed to follow up the leads , however , @entity44 said their actions look like a collusive act			0
" the key police decision - makers referred to in this statement are deceased , " he said			0
" had they been alive today , their actions would have demanded explanation , which would have been the subject of further investigation			0
" the report found no evidence of criminal intent on the part of any government or @entity39 official			0
it also found no evidence that the police had information that could have prevented the bombings			0
in a joint statement , cardinal @entity155 , archbishop of @entity157 , and bishop @entity158 said they accepted the report 's findings and conclusions			0
they said the church had made all known material available to investigators			0
" throughout the @entity170 ( the 30 - year period of violence in @entity1 ) , the @entity39 , along with other churches in @entity1 , was constant in its condemnation of the evil of violence , " they said			2
" it is therefore shocking that a priest should be suspected of involvement in such violence			2
" this case should have been properly investigated and resolved during @entity65 's lifetime			2
if there was sufficient evidence to link him to criminal activity , he should have been arrested and questioned at the earliest opportunity , like anyone else			0
we agree with the police ombudsman that the fact this did not happen failed those who were murdered , injured and bereaved in the bombings			0
" they appealed for any information about other suspects in the case			2
" @entity65 is dead and , as a suspect in the @entity12 bombing , he is beyond the justice of earthly courts , " they said			1
" clearly a number of people were involved in the planning and carrying out of this terrible atrocity , some of whom may still be alive			1
those bereaved and injured deserve to know the truth			0
we appeal to anyone who has information in relation to this horrific crime to provide it to the @entity214			0
" the @entity77 became the @entity214 ( @entity214 ) in 2001			0
the ombudsman began its investigation in late 2002 after the @entity214 said the @entity77 had information that a priest was an active @entity66 member and had been involved in the @entity12 bombings			1

the bombing in @entity12 killed nine people and wounded 30
no one was ever charged in the case
there have long been suspicions that a priest was involved
