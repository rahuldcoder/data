-- like many visitors in @entity3 , @entity1 found himself in the city trying to avoid the rain			2
after wandering around , he eventually made his way to the @entity7 to escape the dreary weather			2
little did he know that stepping into @entity3 's @entity9 would spark his curiosity			2
the library 's geometric glass and steel interior with its sprawling " books spiral " grabbed ahold of him			2
" it 's just an incredible building , " he said , still remembering his awe during that 2013 trip			0
" i spent an hour and a half just taking pictures , and while doing that , i was getting the idea that i should visit other libraries			1
" this past year , @entity1 has traveled to 12 libraries across the @entity25 , photographing their shelves and hallways like an explorer			1
he 's one of many people discovering a renewed fascination with libraries			1
he and other ireporters shared photos of libraries they visited with @entity36 for @entity37 , observed april 13 - 19 this year			1
despite the expansive digitalization of information , the use of public libraries remains popular , according to @entity42 , vice president for the @entity43 and global vice president of marketing at @entity45 , a nonprofit computer library service organization			1
" it surprises people , " she said , explaining there 's a presumption amongst the public that libraries are becoming increasingly irrelevant			1
but despite enduring budget cutbacks and being forced to reinvent their services in the face of the ubiquitous @entity58 , public libraries remain staple institutions in various communities			1
there 's been an increase in the use of public libraries in the @entity25 over the past decade			1
services such as public computers doubled in usage in the past 10 years , and libraries saw a circulation increase of 2.46 billion materials in 2010 , the highest ever reported , according to a report by the @entity72			1
some libraries bring in more than just patrons			1
they are also popular amongst tourists , drawing visitors by the tens of thousands , if not millions			1
the @entity7 system , for example , attracts more than 7 million people through its doors each year			0
" the @entity9 is one of the most beautiful modern buildings in @entity3 , and it really celebrates the people , " said @entity83 , a spokesperson for the library			0
smaller libraries matter , too @entity25 strongly value the role of public libraries in their community , according to findings by the @entity93			1
in fact , 94 % of people polled in 2013 said that having a public library improves the quality of life in a community			1
@entity100 , a writing teacher , agrees			0
she spent many summer days with her daughters , @entity102 and @entity103 , visiting their local library in @entity105 , @entity106			0
but in 2007 , all the libraries in @entity108 closed down for a number of reasons			1
it devastated her daughters who were then 7 and 5			0
" @entity102 told me she was really sad she would n't get to ' visit the books , ' " @entity100 said , remembering her daughter sobbing at the news			1
@entity100 was determined to find a way to help reopen the libraries in her area			1
the community banded together to raise $ 300,000 in 18 months			0
they even got a matching grant from @entity108 , which helped the libraries reopen			1
the experience helped @entity100 rediscover the value of her local library			0
" i actually did n't grow up visiting many libraries , " she said			1
" i did n't discover that wonder until i was much older			0
perhaps that 's why they seem so magical to me now			0
" ' libraries reflect who we are ' @entity133 wanted to capture the value of public libraries through his lens			1
he spent the past 18 years photographing libraries and interviewing people who work and use them			1
in his recently published book , " the @entity7 : a @entity145 , " which includes hundreds of photographs of libraries in 48 states , @entity133 says he was drawn to libraries because they are vital part of a community 's ecosystem			1
" often times , a library reveals things about a community			0
it was really sad to see a closed library when i was passing through the @entity158 , " he said , explaining how that was one of the poorer regions he visited			0
" i am not a librarian , but 18 years of doing this , you peel away things , " he said			0
" it 's interesting how libraries reflect who we are , and what we share			1
@entity166 , president of the @entity167 , says libraries are also incredibly transformative			2
these spaces offer not only information but also provide resources and opportunities to socialize			2
some libraries are " becoming more of a community sharing , learning , conversation space , " she explained			2
programs such as the @entity180 's @entity179 , one @entity181 , an initiative adopted from the @entity7 , aims to rally virtual community engagement around monthly book selections			0
take a tour of the world 's most exquisite libraries others are rebranding themselves as places where people can explore their passions			1
programs such as @entity195 , which is part of @entity45 , partners with libraries to promote the idea that everyone " geeks out " about something , and a local library can help you recognize your special passion			2
through his 18 years of documenting libraries , @entity133 says he 's seen many of them adapt and transform for their communities			2
some took on new daily roles , such as teaching people to write resumes or providing social services			0
" in @entity213 , they have a dedicated social worker , especially for the homeless , " he said			0
" when i was in @entity220 , it one of the hottest days on record , i walked into a library			0
there was this huge guard at the front , the air conditioning was blasting , it was packed , and everyone was reading			0
and i sort of got it -- it was a place of shelter			0
" @entity230 , librarian and senior head of user services and adviser for planning and construction at @entity236 and @entity237 in @entity238 , says there are three main reasons why libraries continue to be popular today : they are information hotspots ; they are places communities can gather ; and they provide learning collaboration			1
they even provide an element of comfort			0
" libraries tend to become more cozy , relaxing and communicative places			2
other than public spaces like museums , they have a certain private character , which makes them a living room for their community , " @entity230 said			1
@entity133 thinks a part of people 's fascination with libraries is sort of irrational , too , but in a good way			2
he attributes our love for libraries to our childhood memories			2
" i think a lot of it goes back to being a kid			0
there 's an emotional connection that is somewhat unique			0
a lot of kids discover libraries with their parents when they are younger , " he explained			2
that affinity can be partially psychological , according to @entity278 of @entity45			0
" i would find it difficult to find 10 people in a crowd who did n't have a positive experience in a library			0
that 's a personal thing , " she said			0
" it 's why libraries continue to be relevant			1
" @entity83 , from the @entity7 , says the most alluring factor of a public library is simple -- it 's free			2
" where else can you go that offers all this for free ? whether you 're in a three - piece suit or a three - day beard , you can go into a library and be welcomed			0
" @entity0 's @entity297 and @entity298 , special to @entity0 , contributed to this story .			0
