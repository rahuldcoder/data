sometimes a 3 - d printer part is just a 3 - d printer part			1
police thought they had seized the @entity2 first @entity3 - printed gun on thursday when they raided a local model - making shop , arrested its 38 - year - old owner , and confiscated a @entity3 printer and a number of parts they believed were for a @entity3 printed gun			1
however , it now appears the parts are likely just replacement components for the @entity3 printer itself			1
officers suspected one piece was a @entity3 - printed plastic magazine and the other a @entity3 - printed trigger			2
the seizure was part of a larger raid targeting organized crime by the @entity24			0
" if what we have seized today can , as we suspect , be used to make a genuine firearm then today will be an important milestone in the fight against this next generation of homemade weapons , " said detective inspector @entity25 in a statement announcing the raid			0
photos of the parts were quickly picked apart online by the @entity36 , including @entity37 , and identified as pieces for a @entity3 printer			2
the store owner told the @entity41 the " magazine " part was actually a " spool holder " for the printer , and that the parts were designed by the printer manufacturer			2
in a follow - up statement , the department acknowledged that they could not confirm the parts were from a @entity3 printed gun , saying they needed further forensic testing by ballistics experts			1
they also plan on searching through the shop - owner 's computer for any incriminating files that might indicate he planned on printing a @entity3 weapon			2
in addition to the plastic components , officers found air rifles and an air pistol in the shop , and said they had " intelligence about the possible production of a weapon using this technology			0
" these particular parts may not be for a gun , but law enforcement officials feel the threat of homemade firearms is very real			1
since the first @entity3 printed gun was successfully fired in may , @entity3 printing technology has been on police radars			1
the printers are dropping in prices , costing anywhere between $ 300 and thousands for a home @entity3 printing machine			0
before they were taken down , the blueprint files needed to make a gun were available online for anyone to download			0
" what this has also done is open up a wider debate about the emerging threat these next generation of weapons might pose , " assistant chief constable @entity90 said in a statement			0
" the worrying thing is for me is that these printers can be used to make certain components of guns , while others can be legitimately ordered over the internet without arousing suspicion			0
when put together , this could allow a person to construct a firearm in their own home			0
" the @entity3 printed gun technology is still in the early stages , but if it irons out the kinks and makes it affordable and easy to produce guns at home , it would create new opportunities for criminals hoping to stay off the radar .			1
