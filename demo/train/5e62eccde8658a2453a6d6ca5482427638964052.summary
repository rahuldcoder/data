-- @entity1 , and @entity2 , @entity3 : two crucial stops for @entity6 secretary of state @entity5 in his ongoing attempt to broker peace between @entity9 and the @entity10			1
@entity5 will travel to those cities on @entity13 to meet with @entity9 prime minister @entity14 and @entity10 president @entity15 , respectively , " to discuss ongoing final status negotiations between the @entity9 and @entity10 , among other issues , " the @entity11 said in a statement saturday			1
this will be the ninth trip to the region for @entity5 , who has said that leaders remain " as determined as ever " to negotiate a peace deal			1
he kicked off talks in july , but in november , both sides dug into their decades - old trenches and passed around blame			1
israelis and @entity10 are four months into a nine - month deadline given to them by @entity5 to reach a peace deal , with little visible progress			1
but just hours after @entity5 's plans were made public , @entity9 announced that 26 @entity10 prisoners will be freed over the next two days			1
the release is part of the deal that set in place the current peace talks , @entity14 's office said in a statement			1
all of the released prisoners perpetrated offenses prior to the @entity46 accords and have served sentences of 19 - 28 years , the @entity9 statement said			0
with direct negotiations between the two sides flailing , the @entity6 seems to have moved into a more muscular role as mediator by presenting its own bridging proposals to the parties instead of relying on the @entity9 and @entity10 to negotiate among themselves			2
on @entity5 's last visit to the @entity59 , earlier this month , talk of @entity57 's nuclear program took center stage			2
that visit was the first following the deal @entity57 reached with the @entity6 and five other world powers over its nuclear program			0
the agreement calls for the easing of economic sanctions on @entity57 in exchange for increased inspections and limits on the country 's uranium enrichment program , which many international analysts fear is meant for military purposes			0
@entity14 has strongly criticized the agreement			0
as for the @entity9 - @entity10 conflict , @entity14 has said that security is a must			2
@entity9 has insisted its own troops must remain in the @entity80 , as opposed to the international troops that patrol the tense borders with @entity83 and @entity84			0
@entity10 have rejected , out of hand , having @entity9 soldiers within the borders of their own states			0
@entity10 have further argued that @entity9 has been sowing distrust by continuing the construction of thousands of jewish settlement units on the @entity3 and other land that @entity10 claim as theirs			0
