-- eight years ago , the secret weapon of @entity4 @entity3 's upstart campaign for president was a little - known website called @entity7 , which was launched in 2002 to make it easy for people with a common interest to find each other and arrange to meet , face to face			1
the site 's founder , @entity13 , had imagined it would be of greatest interest to people with hobbies or a shared passion for a cult movie like " the @entity21			1
" little did he know that it would also be adopted by grass - roots activists meeting to strategize how to help the @entity3 campaign			1
in fact , @entity7 was so little known that at first , @entity3 staffers themselves had no idea that people were using it on his behalf			1
it was n't until @entity3 and his campaign manager , @entity33 , went to a @entity35 @entity34 in early 2003 -- and were stunned to find hundreds of people lining the street -- did they understand the power of the platform			1
" they built our organization for us before we had an organization , " @entity3 later told @entity41			2
the number of participants in @entity48 ultimately peaked at about 143,000 , spread over about 600 locations -- a huge number in those days -- and engagement in the face - to - face local groups dramatically affected how involved volunteers got with the campaign			2
the more @entity48 people attended , the higher their average donation to the campaign , for example			2
according to an academic study by @entity60 and @entity61 of @entity62 , people who reported going to just one @entity34 reported giving $ 154 on average			0
people who went to five or more gave $ 510			0
the more meetups that people attended , the greater their likelihood to tell other people to learn about , volunteer for and , ultimately , vote for their candidate			0
today , @entity7 is a growing , profitable company that is about to celebrate two major milestones : soon , 100 million people will have rsvp 'd to more than 10 million individual meetups , worldwide			2
but the site is no longer a hub for presidential politicking -- at least not in the conventional sense			2
there are just 71 groups on the site devoted to supporting president @entity83 , and the numbers for @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 are all in the low single digits			0
only @entity91 , who has long had an outside - the - establishment message and following , is big on @entity7 , with more than 700 groups and about 88,000 members using the site to connect			1
we should n't really expect to see hundreds of local @entity48 for a presidential candidate at this point in the process , for three reasons			0
first of all , the @entity103 campaigns are all essentially focused on just the first few states to hold caucuses and primaries			0
anything that does n't get them votes or volunteers in @entity111 or @entity112 is a distraction			0
and second , with the exception of @entity91 , none of these candidates -- including @entity83 -- have succeeded in creating anything like a movement behind them in this cycle			1
@entity3 attracted supporters from all over @entity122 because democrats in early 2003 were hungrily searching for a candidate who was anti-war and appeared electable			1
no issue is currently uniting republicans in quite the same way			0
but there 's a third reason why we 're not seeing meetup and presidential politics line up the way they did eight years ago			2
politically inclined grass - roots activism on both the right and left is alive and well on @entity7 in the thriving number of tea party and @entity140 groups using the site			1
and they 're looking for changes that are much bigger than anything offered by either @entity103 or @entity146 candidates			0
as meetup founder @entity13 describes in this talk i filmed of him , given monday to an audience of foundation and nonprofit types in @entity35 , the tea party was , in some ways , born on @entity7			1
" @entity153 went on tv , and he said ... ' go to a @entity155 in your town			0
' they created a @entity155 in about 500 towns ... and they all tagged themselves ' tea party			1
' ... and they are some of the most active @entity48 we see on our system , " he said			0
people are not only organized town - by - town , but " they help each other out if one of them has cancer			0
" more than 700 tea party groups are now active on @entity7 , with nearly 100,000 members			1
now , the @entity175 , which is only about a month old , is taking off on @entity7 as well , with more than 2,400 " @entity175 " communities on the site			2
there 's an important clue here about how the @entity181 will affect the politics of 2012			0
as outside - the - establishment movements like the tea party , @entity140 and @entity91 followers are showing , the two - party system is n't big enough to absorb the concerns and passions of hundreds of thousands of grass - roots activists			1
and these are the people who , despite being a minority of the larger population , can drive the agenda in new directions			0
so while we should n't expect a platform like @entity7 to make any presidential candidate a viable challenger the way it did in 2003 and early 2004 with @entity3 , it ( along with other online platforms and social networks ) is helping do something even bigger : it is enabling @entity122 to create quasi-third parties that are bringing new voices and new issues into the national debate			1
and in a country where the differences between the two major parties are sometimes hard to find , that can only be a good thing for democracy .			0

@entity7 played a strong part in the 2004 campaign of @entity4 @entity3
out of the 2012 presidential candidates , only @entity91 is big on meetup
meetup founder @entity13 says the tea party was born on the site
meetup is enabling @entity122 to create quasi-third parties for new voices and issues
