-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 on friday said he 'd accept a medical marijuana bill that would expand options for patients -- including allowing qualified children to consume edible forms -- but only if certain changes are made			1
@entity1 told the @entity9 that he would sign the bill if it stipulated that edible forms of marijuana would be dispensed only to minors , not to patients of all ages			1
another condition : @entity1 wants to delete a provision that would have let children qualify for the program with only a doctor 's approval			1
current law requires that children receive approval by at least a pediatrician and a psychiatrist			0
the bill , @entity28 , would add edible marijuana to the current dry - leaf and lozenge options for all qualified patients			1
@entity1 wants the bill to allow edible marijuana for qualified children only -- a move that would please parents concerned that the other options posed choking and other health concerns			1
the bill also would eliminate a limit on the number of marijuana strains that the state 's dispensaries can cultivate -- ostensibly making it more likely that they would carry versions that certain patients seek			1
@entity1 did not ask for changes to this provision			1
@entity1 previously worried about going " down the slippery slope of broadening a program and making it easier to get marijuana that would n't necessarily go to other people " â € ” and these modifications are perhaps a strategic compromise to not slide down the " slippery slope			1
" " today , i am making commonsense recommendations to this legislation to ensure sick children receive the treatment their parents prefer , while maintaining appropriate safeguards , " @entity1 said in a statement released friday			1
" i am calling on the @entity9 to reconvene quickly and address these issues so that children in need can get the treatment they need			0
" " as i have repeatedly noted , i believe that parents , and not government regulators , are best suited to decide how to care for their children , " @entity1 continued			1
but some of the bill 's sponsors preferred the original language , which would open up the number of marijuana strains and ingestible forms to a wider range of patients , as well as an easier application process			1
" i think it is ironic that governor @entity1 believes that parents and government regulators should make the decision			1
this might be the most regulated law in the state , " state sen. @entity83 , one of the primary sponsors of the bill , told @entity0 friday			0
" the last thing we want is to delay it for the kids , so we want to pass it as soon as possible , " @entity83 continued			0
" it still requires too many unnecessary hurdles with physicians , but i do n't think we should hold it up anymore			0
" assemblyman @entity98 said older residents who ca n't ingest marijuana smoke should have access to an edible form			1
but he , too , prefers prompt action on the bill			0
girl 's father pressed for changes @entity1 's decision came under pressure from an epileptic girl 's father , who contends the bill would make it easier for her to get a version of the drug that might help her			1
@entity115 's 2 - year - old daughter , @entity114 , suffers a version of epilepsy called @entity119 syndrome			0
normal epilepsy medications have so far failed to work for @entity114 , and her family believes a certain type of medical marijuana -- one with high levels of cannabidiol , or @entity126 -- may be able to help			0
high - @entity126 strains of marijuana have helped other patients with @entity130			2
@entity114 is cleared to receive medical marijuana , but the state 's sole operating dispensary , currently limited by law to offering only three strains , does not offer the high - @entity126 marijuana her family seeks			2
trying to get an answer on the bill but unable to get a meeting with the governor , @entity115 and members of his family on wednesday crashed a small @entity1 campaign stop at a local diner in @entity145			1
" i was wondering what the holdup was ; it 's been like two months now , " @entity115 said to @entity1			2
@entity1 responded that while the decision may be simple for @entity115 , it 's not as easy for the @entity151 governor			2
@entity1 is thought to be a major contender for his party 's 2016 nomination for president			2
marijuana stops child 's severe seizures " these are complicated issues , " @entity1 told @entity115			2
" i know you think it 's simple and it 's not			0
" governor has been cautious on the issue @entity1 has in the past expressed trepidation about marijuana			2
" i am not going to turn @entity2 into @entity168 and @entity169			2
i 'm not legalizing marijuana in @entity2 , " he said in july			2
as for children , @entity1 said he was " very reluctant			1
" of @entity1 's call to modify the bill , @entity115 told @entity0 's @entity175 : " while it is a small victory ... it really just maintains the idea of making ( @entity2 ) one of the worst medical marijuana programs in the country			1
so it 's a small victory but it 's kind of ludicrous in a lot of ways			0
" @entity1 wants the state to keep the existing requirement of approval by at least a pediatrician and a psychiatrist for a child to be part of the medical marijuana program			2
" the psychiatrist is just a roadblock , " @entity115 said			0
" there 's no rhyme or reason to have a psychiatrist be part of this decision			0
you 're talking about sick kids who are n't even mentally necessarily capable of talking			0
@entity114 ca n't even talk			0
" while pleased that more forms of marijuana would be available under the bill , @entity115 said edible forms of the drug should be available to patients of all ages			2
regardless of whether @entity1 the bill is approved , it appears @entity114 may soon have access to high - @entity126 marijuana			1
a dispensary expected to offer a high - @entity126 version is scheduled to open in @entity2 later this year , according to the @entity2 @entity213			1
@entity114 's family also supported the bill because they prefer the edible form to lozenges -- which they say is a choking hazard and contains sugar , which is inadvisable for her condition -- and smoking			0
the @entity115 family and their supporters have a website called @entity228 for @entity114 at which they urge people to write @entity1 and asked him to support the measure			0
the letter says that the type of medical marijuana they want for @entity114 has no " high , " with far less tetrahydrocannabinol , or @entity239 , than in recreational marijuana			0
@entity239 is the active ingredient that gets people high			0
according to the letter , @entity114 has been signed up for medical marijuana , but she " has not received any medication due to @entity2 's overreaching and unsafe restrictions " on the medical marijuana program			0
opinions on the use of marijuana , particularly for medical purposes , have shifted in the @entity251 in recent years , with a growing chorus that it should be made available by prescription			0
" protection of our children remains my utmost concern , and my heart goes out to those children and their families who are suffering with serious illnesses , " @entity1 said			1
are @entity251 opinions on marijuana reaching tipping point ? @entity0 's @entity265 contributed to this report .			0

gov. @entity1 recommends two changes to bill before he signs it
@entity273 would eliminate limit on strains that dispensaries can offer in @entity2
that could give patients access to useful types that otherwise would n't be available
@entity273 also would make it simpler for children to qualify
