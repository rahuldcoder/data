@entity0 , @entity1 -- he lies in a bed on a balloon - type mattress , to reduce pressure on his burned body			1
he is covered with bandages ; a ventilator breathes for @entity10 because he ca n't do it for himself			1
he 's hooked up to the marvels of modern medicine that are trying to give the 15 - year - old burn victim a chance to be a kid once again			1
sixty - five percent of his body is covered with second - and third - degree burns			1
" people are writing horror stories ... but people just ca n't imagine the kind of sickness we 're talking about , " said dr. @entity19 , medical director of the @entity20 / @entity21 in @entity0			0
" i 've been to movies like everyone else , and @entity30 has n't even thought of something like this , " @entity19 said			0
@entity10 is heavily sedated , and the ventilator does not allow him to speak			1
his open wounds are covered by bandages , which are changed daily			2
it 's a four - hour process			1
he has not been able to speak with police since his desperate fight for life began october 12 , when police say five teenage friends , including a 13 - year - old , doused @entity10 with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire			1
the attack occurred after @entity10 reported to police that one of the youths had stolen his father 's bicycle			1
police say the bicycle was stolen because @entity10 did not pay one of the boys $ 40 for a video game			1
according to police , witnesses said the teens called @entity10 " a snitch " as they used a lighter to set him ablaze			1
@entity19 explained how @entity10 's organs are not functioning the way they should be , but that is expected at this early stage of recovery			1
" he 's still on the ventilator and advanced modes of mechanical ventilation			2
we are breathing for him			0
his contribution to the breathing is trivial , " @entity19 said			0
@entity19 also explained that in burn cases , words must be chosen carefully when talking about patients and their condition because so much is at risk and so much can change quickly			0
" when you say he 's doing ok , in this situation it means he 's alive and responding to treatments , " @entity19 said			2
" we 're still dealing with the respiratory failure			0
we 're dealing with infection now and the need to supply the massive amount of nutrition that this person needs to survive			0
" on monday , the five teens who are accused of taking part in the attack appeared separately before judges in @entity90 , @entity1			1
state prosecutors were granted additional time to build their case			0
formal charges are expected later this month			0
for now , all five teens are being held in custody			2
four of the boys , all 15 years old , could be charged as adults			2
the 13 - year - old also could be charged as an adult but under @entity1 law only if @entity10 dies			1
@entity10 's parents , @entity102 and @entity103 , issued a written statement through the hospital last week			1
they are not granting interviews			0
" the recovery process will be baby steps , but eventually he will be whole again , " they wrote			0
but their son 's injuries enter the realm of medicine and science that has no guarantee			2
" there 's no evolutionary mechanism to survive a 65 percent burn , " @entity19 said			1
" surviving is a miracle of modern medicine and about the technology and the things we do			0
this is not like a gunshot and you come out of the [ operating room ] , and say everything 's going to be ok , " he added			2
" we never give up , and we never predict it			0
... our expectation is survival			0
" across the hospital floor in the burn unit at @entity21 , six other people 's lives also are at stake : all victims of various accidents , all with burns similar to @entity10 's			1
they , too , are trying to regain at least a part of what they used to have			0
" it 's understandable that people can be burned in accidents , " @entity19 said			2
" but this was no accident			0
this did n't have to happen at all			0
