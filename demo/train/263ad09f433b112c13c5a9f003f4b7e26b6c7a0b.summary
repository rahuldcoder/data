@entity0 , @entity1 -- four days after @entity5 's earthquake , a 2 - month - old baby girl was brought to a field hospital barely alive , her skull fractured , her ribs broken , her pulse dangerously low			1
doctors at the makeshift hospital in @entity12 knew the baby had only hours to live if they did n't get her to a pediatric intensive care unit			0
assuming she was an orphan -- she 'd been found in the rubble of an apartment building in the arms of a dead woman -- they whisked her to a plane headed to @entity0 , @entity1			1
they had no idea that back in @entity12 , a couple named @entity23 and @entity24 were frantically searching for their baby girl			1
the couple 's efforts to reunite with their daughter in the @entity30 has been an odyssey of grief , legal entanglements , dna tests and strength to persevere when it seemed all hope had been lost			1
searching for their lost baby when the earthquake hit @entity5 on january 12 , @entity23 was at home with her daughter and her babysitter			1
she watched in horror as the floor fell apart beneath them and @entity47 fell headfirst through a hole , followed by the baby sitter			1
devilme herself was knocked unconscious			0
the next thing she knew , she awoke at a local hospital			0
her husband , who was not at home when the quake struck , rushed to be by her side			0
she told him to go back to their home and search through the rubble to look for @entity47			2
for four days -- tuesday , wednesday , thursday , and friday -- @entity24 came back with the same news for his wife : he could n't find @entity47			1
then on saturday , a neighbor arrived with news : someone had found @entity47 and taken her to a hospital			2
which hospital ? the neighbor did n't know			0
the couple searched hospitals nearby but found no sign of their daughter			2
finally , they learned that she had been taken across town to a field hospital set up near the airport by the @entity78 , and then flown to @entity79 in @entity0			2
thrilled to learn their daughter was alive , the couple then learned they could n't see her			2
with no passport and no visa , they had no way to get to the @entity30			2
they could n't even prove the baby was their daughter			0
by that time , many were calling her " @entity90 , " the name given to her after the ambulance driver who got her to the plane to @entity0 on time			2
now @entity23 and @entity24 set out to prove that this little girl was theirs -- that she was n't @entity90 , but @entity47			1
proving they were the parents through the @entity99 , @entity23 and @entity24 requested a dna test to prove they were the parents			1
@entity102 happened for weeks , partly because of a legal dispute over whether the baby should be a ward of the state of @entity1 or a ward of the federal government , according to @entity109 , a spokesman for the @entity110			0
" i ca n't sleep at night , " @entity23 said march 6 in @entity111 through a translator			2
" this is all that i have			0
she 's my only child			0
" to show that @entity47 was her child , @entity23 showed a visiting journalist @entity47 's vaccination record from the local hospital and a small blue bible inscribed with the baby 's name and date of birth			1
while he awaited the dna test , @entity24 carried around a black - and - white copy of a photograph , sent to him through the @entity99 , of the baby in her crib at the hospital in @entity0			1
" i look at the picture and i cry , " he said in march			0
" that 's all i have , is this picture			0
" then @entity130 , a @entity5 - @entity30 lawyer in @entity0 , took interest in the case and became the attorney for the baby , who was referred to as " @entity135 " in court hearings and " @entity137 " at her foster home in @entity0			1
he asked @entity0 attorney @entity139 to represent @entity23 and @entity24			1
together , the lawyers pushed for a dna test , and on march 16 , @entity23 and @entity24 were informed of the results : she was n't an unknown baby or @entity137 or @entity90 -- she was their baby , @entity137			1
" this is a case where these were really good parents , and i ca n't wait for these parents to be reunited with their baby , " @entity145 circuit judge @entity144 said at a hearing march 17			0
" this is one happy day			0
" a tearful reunion it took another two weeks of legal maneuvering to get @entity23 and @entity24 passports and visas , and on monday , after 84 anxious days , they were reunited with their daughter			1
first , they were taken from the tent city where they 've been staying to the @entity12 airport			0
for the first time , the couple met the lawyers who 'd been helping them , as well as dr. @entity167 , the @entity78 doctor who arranged to have their daughter flown to the @entity30			1
" this is what they call in @entity111 a mirak -- a miracle , " @entity167 said at the airport			0
the couple then flew to @entity0 and were driven to his house , the foster care provider where @entity47 has lived since being released from the hospital			1
when @entity23 and @entity24 walked through the door of the cottage where @entity47 lives , they immediately sunk to their knees , embracing their baby and crying			1
@entity47 smiled and looked around , made eye contact with her parents and the foster care worker who cared for her in her parents ' absence			0
" it was impossible to have a dry eye , " said @entity139 , who was present at the reunion			0
the parents have a one - year " humanitarian parole " -- a type of visa -- from the federal government and can apply to have it renewed , according to @entity192 , a lawyer for the @entity110			0
@entity47 is still receiving care for a fractured skull and receives physical therapy for her injured arm , which she still ca n't use properly			1
but in general , she 's in good health , a far cry from the emaciated , frail child brought to @entity0 nearly three months ago			2
" she 's a fat little baby , " @entity139 said			0
" she 's a happy , bouncy little kid			0
