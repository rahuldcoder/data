" terrorists planted explosive devices " in the headquarters of @entity15 , located near @entity16 , killing three journalists and four security guards , the state - run @entity10 reported			0
the attackers also ransacked and destroyed studios , the news outlet said			0
" the massacre wo n't go unpunished , " information minister @entity22 said			0
the regime of president @entity25 has accused foreign media of conspiring against the country and said @entity15 works to counter the " sinister campaign			0
" but observers say @entity30 is a mouthpiece for the government 's propaganda , refusing to acknowledge the regime 's violence on dissidents seeking freedom			0
the bombing comes a day after @entity25 said his restive country is in a " state of war " and as @entity41 and @entity43 envoy @entity42 scheduled a meeting of top diplomats saturday in @entity46 , @entity47 , to tackle the conflict			1
@entity49 hardens military position after @entity4 downs jet after more than 15 months , unrest in the @entity54 nation shows no sign of abating			1
internationally , tension rose last week after @entity4 shot down a @entity49 jet , an act deplored by @entity60 and many @entity62 nations			1
at least 83 people were killed in nationwide violence wednesday , the opposition @entity63 said			1
the diplomats want to address an environment in which , according to a @entity41 report published wednesday , new rebel groups are emerging and fighters are making strides and gaining potency			1
" the situation on the ground has dramatically changed in the last three months as the hostilities by anti-government armed groups each day take on more clearly the contours of an insurrection , " said the report , issued by the @entity74 on the @entity4			1
" as a result of the estimated flow of new weapons and ammunitions , both to the government forces and to the anti-government armed groups , the situation risks becoming more aggravated in the coming months			2
the international community must not fail to implement a concerted effort to put an end to the violence			0
" the @entity41 and other entities tracking the conflict in @entity4 noted the increasing clout of anti-government forces in past months			1
the report cites this trend , saying rebel " operations in some locations are improving in efficiency and organization			1
" the opposition is growing across @entity4 and fighting government forces on several fronts			1
the groups are engaging with government forces in " direct combat " and are attacking military and security facilities , the report said			1
" their increasing capacity to access and make use of available weapons has been demonstrated in recent weeks , " the report said			2
it said rebels have n't gotten " new or more sophisticated weaponry			0
" but they are using improvised explosive devices " against army and security convoys , patrols and facilities such as military buildings and checkpoints			0
" " in at least one case , this has led to collateral damage among civilians and their properties			0
according to reliable sources , anti-government armed groups have also been using ieds in assassinations , targeting government officials and individuals from the army and security forces			2
" the report said rebel forces " have effectively challenged " the regime 's authority in @entity16 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity146 provinces			1
for example , it said , the government forces ' control of the country 's borders has been regularly undermined , and cross-border movements of refugees as well as of anti-government fighters appear to be more frequent and fluid			2
can @entity49 force @entity155 and other @entity60 countries to attack @entity4 ? @entity157 , former president of the opposition @entity158 based in @entity49 , said he slipped over the border into @entity4 on a brief visit to @entity144 province , and described rebel resolve and bravery amid a moonscape of destruction			1
" the spirits of the fighters are very , very high , " he told @entity0			0
" they are ready to die for their freedom			0
the major problem that the fighters are facing is the nonstop bombardment by planes and tanks			0
this is making the battle difficult as the rebels do n't have heavy weapons			0
many cities and towns are already liberated			0
i was driven around @entity144 in a car with a banner saying ' the @entity184			0
' " many observers say the rebel fighting forces have been too autonomous and have lacked central command			1
@entity157 said they are " very united " and " cooperating among themselves			0
" " despite that , there is no serious arming ; the rebels are gathering arms from the attacks and battles they do with the regime forces , " he said			2
" they are so organized on the ground , they have formed committees to help each other : medical , social , political , etc. i am simply amazed			0
" the @entity74 is investigating the killings last month of more than 100 people in the @entity204 -- where most of those slain were reportedly women and children -- but has been limited because it has n't gotten access to the country			2
it has had to conduct interviews with people by telephone or in the countries to which they fled			2
so far , it said , it ca n't rule out , " with the available evidence , " the possibility that perpetrators include pro-government militias , rebels or foreign groups			0
but , it said , " forces loyal to the government may have been responsible for many of the deaths			2
" many observers believe the @entity204 killings may have resulted from sectarian violence			0
@entity204 comprises three towns with a majority @entity231 population			0
they are ringed by @entity234 and @entity235 villages			0
most @entity4 are @entity231 , and many of them support the opposition			1
the government is dominated by @entity235 , an offshoot of @entity234			0
" where previously victims were targeted on the basis of their being pro- or anti-government , the ( @entity74 ) has recorded a growing number of incidents where victims appear to have been targeted because of their religious affiliation , " the report said , describing conditions across @entity4			1
the commission said special envoy @entity42 's peace initiative " offers the best framework for a resolution of the conflict , " and @entity42 's planned saturday meeting of the @entity255 for @entity4 will work on steps to implement his six - point peace initiative			1

" i look forward to a productive meeting this weekend , where we can all agree on concrete actions to end the cycle of violence and bring peace and stability to the @entity4 people			1
" @entity155 sees stalemate in @entity4 fighting @entity155 secretary of state @entity285 plans to attend the meeting			2
speaking in @entity287 , @entity288 , she said that , if participants can meet on the basis of laying out a road map to a political transition in @entity4 , " then a meeting makes a lot of sense " and " could be a turning point			2
" a transition road map backed by @entity263 and @entity261 , which have blocked tough previous attempts by the @entity260 to act against @entity4 , would send a strong message to the @entity25 regime , she said			2
