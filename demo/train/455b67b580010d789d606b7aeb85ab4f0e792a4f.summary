-- in @entity3 soccer it is an offense that is taken as seriously as almost any other -- diving			0
and once again , it is controversial @entity7 striker @entity6 in the firing line			1
after their @entity12 clash on saturday , @entity10 manager @entity9 called for the @entity13 to be banned by the @entity14 , for what he saw as @entity6 's " embarrassing " attempt to win a penalty			1
it is not the first time @entity6 has been accused of play acting but his manager @entity21 has launched an impassioned defense of his star player , claiming that coverage of his fall has overshadowed a stamping incident earlier in the match			1
@entity10 's @entity29 defender @entity28 appeared to tread on @entity6 during a tangle at @entity31 , leaving the striker with a stud mark on his chest , but the @entity14 has decided not to take any action against the @entity29			1
and through the club 's official website , @entity21 has expressed his frustration that all the focus is on @entity6 , and not huth			1
" i find it incredible that in nearly all the coverage about @entity6 this weekend , very little focus has been placed on the fact that he was actually the victim of a stamping incident within the first five minutes of the game , " said @entity21			1
" at this moment there seems to be one set of rules for @entity6 and another set for everyone else			2
" @entity52 ' @entity10 team has a reputation as being one of the most physical sides in the @entity12 and only two weeks ago he labeled two @entity57 players " laughable " for what he saw as contrived attempts to win a penalty			2
the @entity61 implored the authorities to clamp down on players who dive and told reporters a three - match ban would stop them from " falling over			2
" " @entity6 is a fantastic player with great ability , " he added			2
" he is a handful and he is the one player we are frightened to death about			0
" what happens is that he puts enormous pressure on the referee			0
every time he goes down , you have got 40,000 - odd @entity7 supporters getting after the referee and i do n't think that 's right			2
it is a tough enough job as it is			0
" @entity6 has become one of the league 's most talked about players since joining @entity7 from @entity83 club @entity82 in january 2011			1
he is also one of its most divisive			0
the 25 - year - old was banned for eight @entity12 matches after being found guilty of racially abusing @entity88 defender @entity87 last year			0
his technical ability means he is always closely guarded by opposition teams , and @entity7 have complained in the past he does n't get enough preotection from the officials			0
@entity21 thinks saturday 's incident with @entity28 is a perfect illustration of that			1
in the @entity7 manager 's opinion , @entity6 is being persecuted			1
he added : " diving and simulation is obviously a wider issue in football and one that we all agree has to be eradicated from our game but there were other incidents this weekend that did n't seem to generate the same coverage			0
" no one should be distracted by the real issue here , both at @entity31 and at another game played on sunday , when @entity6 and another player were hurt in off - the - ball incidents that went unpunished but were caught on tv cameras			0
" i believe some people need to develop a sense of perspective and i also believe in this moment the vilification of @entity6 is both wrong and unfair			0
