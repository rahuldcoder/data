-- when @entity0 's @entity2 visited a bird sanctuary on his new series " @entity5 , " he drew some heat from viewers			1
@entity8 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , posted this on @entity2 's @entity13 account : " @entity14 , love the new show ... i watched the last episode with the cranes and the birds suits ( little weird ... but whatever )			1
one question came to mind though -- is that place funded privately or by the government ? i kept thinking it 's one of those places that costs the tax payers millions each year to keep the doors open			1
" another viewer , @entity28 , wrote : " you did a disservice to @entity31 and the whooping crane project on " somebody 's @entity5			1
" you came across as bored and disdainful			1
you say you work for the people who watch you and not the people who pay you -- ok			1
" @entity2 's response : " @entity38 fair enough			1
i 've been on probation my whole career , and i 'll be grateful to remain there as long as you can tolerate me			2
but for what it 's worth , you 're mistaken			1
i was neither bored nor disdainful of anything i saw at the whooping crane facility			1
in fact , i was genuinely impressed with dr. @entity49 and his team , and glad to give their program some national exposure			2
now it 's true - i did n't swoon in their presence , or behave as though i agreed with every single thing i heard			2
dr. @entity49 was very clear about why he does what he does - he believes the whooping crane has as much right to exist as we do			2
i doubt that everyone shares that view			0
should they ? whooping cranes were nearly hunted into extinction , and left homeless as their natural environment was systematically eliminated by short - sighted homo sapiens			1
personally , that makes me sad and angry			0
thus , i 'm happy to shine a light on dr. @entity49 's efforts , and pay some money to see the whooping crane survive			1
but @entity8 asks a very fair question			0
how much ? more than the spotted owl ? less than the whales ? should there be a limit on what we spend to save an endangered species ? depending on your worldview , questions like these are annoying			2
but they are nevertheless important , because we 're all in this together			0
is the whooping crane more valuable than the snow leopard ? what about the desert tortoise ? or the black rhino ? exactly how bad are we supposed to feel when a species exits planet earth ? is it a tragedy ? an ecological disaster ? or just a damn shame ? @entity98 's of people are currently worried about overfishing -- specifically , the depletion of the worlds tuna stocks			1
some people are worried because they 're concerned about the rising price of tuna			2
others are worried about its long term viability as a delicious menu item			0
and others are protesting because they believe it 's morally wrong to eat them			2
the difference is important , because an individuals worldview will absolutely inform their opinion about basic conservation			0
according to some other show i just narrated for some other channel , there are approximately 8.7 million species on the planet , give or take 1.3 million			0
( if a 1.3 million delta seems high , consider that the previous estimate put the number of total species on @entity125 between 3 million and 100 million , which is somewhat baffling in and of itself			0
) but here 's the most intriguing statistic -- of the 8.7 million species now estimated to inhabit the planet , approximately 88 % have yet to be discovered , described and cataloged			2
that strikes me as rather extraordinary			0
point is , you could fill a library with what we do n't know about biodiversity			0
and yet , many people have a deep and abiding conviction about the proper way to discuss the plight of endangered animals			1
you seem offended @entity143 , because my attitude did not reflect the seriousness that you believe this topic deserves			0
but consider -- many others were equally offended because i gave a platform to a man who believes that all creatures on the planet are entitled to the same right to exist as humans			0
a lot of people told me that with 7,000 children dying every year from hunger , the plight of the whooping crane was not worth my time			1
thus , addressing this topic in a light - hearted television show is guaranteed to offend somebody			0
if you watch the episode again , ( assuming i 'm still on probation , ) i think you 'll see that we tried to focus on the human elements -- the simple joy that dr. @entity49 and his team take in their work , and the passion they bring to their job each and every day			0
experts call it " congruency , " that rare and wondrous state that occurs when your beliefs and your actions line up perfectly , and net out in a vocation or avocation that you truly love			0
dr. @entity49 is first and foremost , congruent , and thus , perfectly suited for @entity180			0
are his efforts worth the cost ? was i disrespectful ? is there no room for levity ? those are fair questions upon which reasonable people might disagree			2
but one thing 's for sure -- the cranes are damn lucky to have the good doctor in their corner			1
and i wish them both every success			0
