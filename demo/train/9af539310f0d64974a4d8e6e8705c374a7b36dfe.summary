it 's the focus of @entity1 's new feature - length documentary , also named " @entity17			1
" the outpost , @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity21 in an interview thursday night , was hellish			2

no running water , they did n't bathe for a month at a time			0
no internet , no phone , no electricity at first , " he said			0

@entity42 , you do n't even have to like the guy , but if he 's your brother , you 'll protect him , you 'll die for him			0
