@entity0 -- a federal judge thursday sentenced a @entity4 scientist convicted of attempting to kill @entity5 in @entity6 to 86 years in prison			1
a jury in @entity9 convicted @entity10 on seven charges , including attempted murder and armed assault on @entity5 officers , in february			1
she will serve her sentence at a facility in @entity17 where she was previously held while awaiting trial			0
prosecutors said @entity10 picked up a rifle and shot at two @entity22 special agents , a @entity24 warrant officer , an @entity24 captain and military interpreters while she was being held unrestrained at an @entity6 facility on july 18 , 2008			1
the agents returned fire shooting her in the abdomen			0
@entity6 police had arrested her outside the @entity35 governor 's compound in central @entity6 after finding her with bomb - making instructions , excerpts from the " @entity39 's @entity38 , " papers with descriptions of @entity5 landmarks , and substances sealed in bottles and glass jars , according to the charges			1
the indictment said @entity10 had " handwritten notes that referred to a ' mass casualty attack ' " listing several locations in the @entity5 and " construction of ' dirty bombs			1
' " upon her conviction , the @entity5 - educated neuroscientist , blasted the decision as " a verdict from @entity57 , not @entity5			2
" @entity10 's family said she had been unjustly convicted			1
at her sentencing thursday morning , the 38 year - old @entity60 graduate shook her head in defiance and wagged her finger in a " no " gesture as @entity5 district judge @entity66 laid out the case against her			2
but @entity10 was more subdued when @entity68 allowed her to speak before the packed courtroom filled with family , spectators and foreign and national press			2
clad in a khaki suit and a hijab that covered most of her face , @entity10 repeatedly asked her @entity77 supporters to not " get emotional			2
" " i do n't want any violence in my name , " @entity10 said of demonstrations in her native @entity4 , where her case has become a cause celebre			2
" if you do anything for me , please educate people about @entity86 because people do n't understand that it is a religion of mercy			0
" before the judge sentenced @entity10 to more than eight decades in prison , defense attorney @entity90 told the court that it was the most difficult case of her career			1
" dr. @entity10 is an enigma , " @entity90 said of her client , who had attempted multiple times to fire her team of attorneys hired by the government of @entity4			1
@entity90 said there were many unanswered questions in her client 's case , including where she was between the years of 2003 and 2008 , when @entity10 claims to have been held in a secret prison			0
" the government has not admitted to secret prisons or torture			0
but the information is going to come out , " @entity90 said , noting that solitary confinement had taken a visible toll on @entity10 who " had diminished mental capacity			0
" since 2003 , the whereabouts of @entity10 had been the source of much speculation			0
according to @entity119 , @entity10 and her three small children were reported apprehended in @entity121 , @entity4 , in march 2003 , shortly after the @entity22 issued an alert requesting information about her location			0
several reports indicated that @entity10 was in @entity5 custody after her arrest in @entity121			1
but in may 2004 , then - attorney general @entity128 and fbi director @entity129 identified @entity10 as being among several sought - after @entity131 members			1
@entity10 was extradited to the @entity5 in august 2008 , after the shooting incident			1
" we are going to look back on this era in our country and we are going to say that fear is what drove our sentences , " @entity90 said			0
" despite the fact that this is a woman of peace who has repeatedly said she does n't support any acts of vengeance in her name , i fear that the injustice done to her will cause outrage throughout the @entity77 world , " said @entity139 , executive director or @entity140 and spokesperson for the @entity10 family			0
@entity9 @entity5 attorney @entity153 hailed the sentence , commending federal and military investigators in the case			2
" as a unanimous jury found beyond a reasonable doubt , @entity10 attempted to murder @entity5 serving in @entity6 , as well as their @entity6 colleagues			1
she now faces the stiff consequences of her violent actions			0
