@entity0 -- they smelled blood			2
@entity6 : ' i apologize , i 'm accountable ' @entity8 is one issue that unites @entity9 and any opportunity to disparage the law was not wasted wednesday as the woman in charge of implementing it , @entity7 secretary @entity6 , appeared before the @entity15 to explain what is going on with the program 's problem - plagued website			1
as @entity9 lobbed question after question and challenged her credibility and competence , @entity6 held it together , mostly			1
i 'm sorry it started with an apology			2
@entity6 apologized for @entity25 being a " miserably frustrating experience " and said she is " as frustrated and angry as anyone			1
" " i 'm accountable to you for fixing these problems , " she said in the first minutes of the 3Â½ - hour grilling			2
but it went downhill from there and @entity6 at times grew visibly frustrated			1
' i was wrong ' @entity6 did n't sugarcoat the website 's problems			1
she shielded president @entity36 from responsibility for the faulty enrollment website			2
" i told the president that we were ready to go			2
we were wrong , " she said			0
" no one ever imagined the volume of issues and problems that we 've had and we must fix it			0
" crash then she did sugarcoat the problem			0
" i would suggest the website has never crashed			0
it is functional , but at a very slow speed and very low reliability and has continued to function , " she said as a video monitor in the hearing room showed that the website was down			0
the @entity57 launched an online web campaign that included an ad with an overweight man lying on the floor saying , " i 'm not down			0
i 'm just functioning at a very slow speed			0
" ' whatever ' " whatever , " was one of her responses during a grilling from rep. @entity67 , @entity68 , on whether @entity36 was responsible for the debacle			0
after responding , " whatever , " the secretary put both her hands in the air , briefly , then resumed			0
" he is the president			0
he is responsible for government programs , " she concluded			0
exasperated @entity6 to questioner : ' whatever ' a @entity57 senator who was not at the hearing , @entity81 of @entity82 , put out a statement criticizing the secretary			1
" ' whatever ' is hardly a fitting response from a cabinet - level official being asked legitimate questions about how hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted on a botched product that not only does n't work but is also putting consumers ' personal information at risk , " @entity81 said			1
it then became a @entity9 talking point			1
' do n't do this to me ' during one grilling session in which @entity6 was aggressively asked why she is n't buying her health insurance through the exchanges , a visibly annoyed @entity6 had a " hot mic " moment that has become online fodder			1
at the end of an intense questioning session by rep. @entity107 , @entity108 , viewers could ( barely ) hear an audible moment of exasperation when she muttered , " do n't do this to me			2
" more : 5 things we learned from @entity6 hearing @entity1 's @entity115 contributed to this report			1

as @entity9 lob questions at her , @entity6 tries to keep cool
