@entity0 -- when chef and food aficionado @entity3 opened the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity0 , some 24 years ago , few there had even heard of @entity9 cuisine			1
he was the first to open an @entity9 business on @entity11 , a bustling neighborhood in the borough of @entity14 , and a small - business hub now known as " @entity7			1
" it 's long been a home to immigrants -- first @entity19 , then @entity20 and @entity21 , and most recently , @entity22			1
almost half of @entity14 businesses are minority owned and together they bring in an average of $ 7 billion annually			2
while it typifies the growth of many @entity30 neighborhoods , @entity7 also boasts one of the most diverse populations in the @entity30 , according to recent census results			1
foreign - born residents in the borough come from over 100 different nations			0
@entity3 embraces the new immigrants he 's seen settle here in his 40 - plus years in @entity7			1
" ( the ) neighborhood it changes because if a neighborhood does n't change it means it 's a dead neighborhood , " he said			0
and this neighborhood has certainly changed			0
from selling hookah pipes , to selling @entity45 clothes , recently arrived merchants from @entity47 have found ways to set - up shop			1
the @entity30 government estimates that 60,000 @entity9 @entity30 live in the tri-state area of @entity0 , @entity52 and @entity53 , with more than 21,000 of them in @entity0			1
merchants here are n't just at the whim of shifting tastes and the demands of new arrivals			1
like business owners everywhere , they 're also susceptible to changes in the national economy			0
@entity3 's brother , @entity64 , is chef at the @entity66 across the road			0
he knows first hand the perils of change			0
" you know the recession affects everybody -- the recession , 9/11 all these things ... the snow affects this business , " he said			2
for him , as for many of the immigrants who pass through here , less income has far - reaching consequences			2
many merchants in @entity7 work with one goal in mind -- to support the families they left behind			1
@entity87 owner @entity86 has relatives in @entity7 who depend on him			1
" a lot of people support his family back home , " said @entity86			1
" at least if you send like $ 100 a month to support your family , if you have a wife over there or if you have a sister or a mother			2
a lot of people need help			0
" and they depend on each other here too , @entity3 explained			0
" we believe that money goes around and we want to take care of our neighborhood and our merchants , " he said			2
@entity3 practices what he preaches , shopping daily in the local markets to stock his restaurant 's kitchen			0
supporting the neighborhood is not his only impetus			0
immigrants with common origins often have common ideals			2
@entity120 is the owner of the @entity121			0
he prefers doing business with other @entity123 in @entity7			1
" this is only @entity125 money , like for example , there is no liquor , no ham , no pork , nothing ; everything is 100 %			0
i know it is halal , " he said .			0
