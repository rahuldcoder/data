@entity0 -- it always comes back to the budget			1
with @entity5 facing a crucial debate on attacking @entity7 over chemical weapons use , conservatives are signaling their price for support may be increased funding for a shrinking military budget			1
two hawkish @entity13 -- sens. @entity14 of @entity15 and @entity16 of @entity17 -- went to the @entity18 on monday to argue their call for a robust military campaign against @entity7 intended to significantly weaken the regime of president @entity22			1
implicit with such a campaign would be the needed restoration of military funding cut by austerity measures and transformation policies in recent years , including the forced spending cuts known as sequestration imposed by @entity5 for the current fiscal year			2
" we can not keep asking the military to perform mission after mission with a sequestration and military cuts hanging over their heads , " @entity13 rep. @entity31 of @entity32 , the chairman of the @entity33 , told @entity1 on monday			1
" we have to take care of our own people first			0
" while @entity31 made clear that his concern is about future preparedness rather than current capability , he argued a bedrock conservative stance against having the military be a major contributor to cost - cutting in @entity0			1
" i have no concerns of their capability			0
they 're the strongest , best equipped , best trained military , " he said			0
" what i 'm looking at is what they 've been hit with the last couple years			0
where will they be the next time they 're asked ? " noting that " the world has not gotten safer , " @entity31 complained that " we 're cutting back $ 1 trillion out of our military , asking them to do more with less			1
" @entity66 looks to @entity5 to bolster legal case for @entity7 strike @entity31 : stop asking the military to do more with less " that has to stop , " he said , calling for president @entity66 to " fix " the across - the - board spending cuts on the military and other discretionary government spending that does n't include entitlement programs such as @entity74 and @entity75			1
after meeting with @entity66 , both @entity14 and @entity16 said they were encouraged by the president 's intended approach , which includes more military aid for @entity7 's opposition while degrading the capabilities of @entity22 's forces			1
however , they said they need more detailed assurances that the @entity88 strategy would be sufficiently strong and sustainable before they could recommend it to their colleagues , who will vote in coming weeks on whether to authorize military action			0
" there seems to be emerging from this administration a pretty solid plan to upgrade the opposition " in @entity7 and to " get regional players more involved " in shifting the balance of the @entity7 civil war against the @entity22 regime , @entity16 said			2
both @entity14 and @entity16 said congressional rejection of a resolution authorizing @entity88 military force in @entity7 would be catastrophic and undermine the credibility of the nation and the president			1
@entity7 vote could have consequences for 2016 @entity7 issue exacerbates budge wars the @entity7 issue exacerbates an already hostile budget environment between the two parties			1
with fiscal year 2013 ending in four weeks , @entity5 has yet to pass a 2014 budget and is expected to consider a short - term measure to extend spending at current levels for weeks or months to allow time for further negotiations			2
a major issue of the budget debate is whether to recalibrate spending to soften or eliminate the impact of the forced cuts of sequestration			1
while both sides say that is the right move , they remain unable to agree on how to make it happen			0
@entity66 and @entity127 want to maintain or increase spending on education , technology and infrastructure , while @entity13 seek to shrink overall government spending			1
the two sides also differ on tax reform , another key component of spending policy			0
in addition , the government says it needs an increase in its borrowing limit -- the debt ceiling -- sometime next month			0
some @entity13 advocate a government shutdown unless @entity127 capitulate on spending cuts , especially to a call by tea party conservatives such as sen. @entity146 of @entity147 to eliminate from next year 's budget the funds needed to implement the 2010 health care reform law			1
opinion : @entity66 on war -- a realist and risk taker @entity5 to debate @entity7 resolution @entity5 will not vote on @entity66 's request to authorize the use of force against @entity7 until sometime after it officially returns from recess september 9			2
to launch the debate on @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity18 committees will hold hearings this week			1
secretary of state @entity166 , defense secretary @entity167 and @entity169 chairman gen. @entity168 will appear at the first hearing by the @entity171 on tuesday , sources said			0
in addition , @entity66 will meet tuesday with @entity18 speaker @entity173 and @entity175 @entity174 , as well as leaders of national security committees in @entity5			2
conservatives have increased references to overall military spending in recent days when commenting on the @entity7 situation			1
" i have watched what 's happened in the last 4 1/2 years with the president downgrading our military , " sen. @entity182 of @entity183 , the top @entity13 on the @entity184 , told @entity1 on friday			2
" and it 's to the point where we 're in a position right now where we do n't have the assets to get involved in another intervention			0
" he warned that firing cruise missiles at @entity7 would inevitably lead to greater involvement and that administration officials must " make sure that you tell us how you 're going to pay for it , what resources you 're going to use , what assets you 're going to use and that they 're there			2
" @entity13 rep. @entity204 of @entity205 , who sits on the @entity206 , argued monday for a bigger mission than the limited strikes @entity66 has said he has been considering			1
" it does us no good to just lob a few missiles into @entity7 , " @entity204 said			2
" this is in the context of an @entity215 - backed enterprise with @entity22 , with @entity216			0
you have @entity218 now having the ability to move on the ground and perhaps get chemical weapons			0
@entity88 has interests that are much more broad than some short strike could possibly accomplish and so we need a strategic vision with real definable and achievable goals			0
" military has concerns about @entity7 mission the administration 's " flood the zone " strategy @entity66 and his team also emphasize the national security angle when arguing for a military response to what they call a major chemical weapons attack by @entity22 's regime on august 21 on @entity241 suburbs			2
the president , along with vice president @entity243 and @entity18 chief of staff @entity244 , was making phone calls to @entity18 and @entity162 members to try to firm up commitments ahead of the congressional vote			1
a conference call with @entity18 @entity127 also was planned as part of what a senior administration official called a strategy to " flood the zone			0
" in the calls , the official said , the @entity18 will be making the same case it did during a classified @entity161 briefing sunday			0
the argument is that failure to take action against @entity7 would undermine the deterrent of international action against chemical weapons use , emboldening @entity22 and his key allies -- @entity216 and @entity215 -- who will see a lack of consequences for such a flagrant violation			0
on the administration side , there is no mention -- yet -- of the military budget			0
could @entity7 strike back if @entity88 , allies , attack ?			0

@entity13 rep. @entity31 : we have to stop asking the military to do more with less
