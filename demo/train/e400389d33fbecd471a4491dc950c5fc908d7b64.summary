-- @entity1 ended @entity3 's unbeaten start to the @entity5 season with an emphatic 3 - 1 victory at the @entity7 in the first @entity8 of the season on saturday			1
@entity10 started his first competitive game for the @entity13 club after completing a four - month ban for biting @entity15 at the @entity16 but was powerless to stop a frequently rampant @entity1 side			1
@entity10 , who arrived from @entity18 for â ‚ ¬ 82.5 million ( $ 105 million ) in the summer , immediately showed what offensive bite he could offer his new employers when he provided an assist for @entity3 's opening goal in the fourth minute			1
his looping cross from the right fell at the feet of @entity26 who then sprinted unchallenged along the 18 - yard line before drilling a low shot past @entity30			0
@entity31 could and perhaps should have doubled the lead in the 23rd minute when @entity10 again slung in a dangerous low ball from the right			2
but the @entity35 , who needs one goal to equal @entity39 's all - time @entity5 scoring record of 251 goals , contrived to shoot directly at @entity30 who deflected the ball behind			1
it proved to be a costly miss as the home side grew in stature and after some near misses -- @entity47 hit both the post and the bar with separate attempts -- @entity1 got their reward when @entity52 used his arm to block @entity55 's cross from the byline			1
the referee pointed to the penalty spot and @entity59 duly scored , sending @entity60 the wrong way and ending the @entity3 keeper 's record run of 755 minutes without conceding a goal			1
the home side carried the momentum into the second half and took the lead five minutes after the break when @entity70 headed home from a corner before @entity47 finished off a superb move in the 61st minute			1
it was a goal that exemplified @entity1 's hunger and counterattacking qualities as the ever industrious @entity77 stole the ball from under the noses of @entity80 and @entity81 on the left touchline			2
the 22 - year - old then slipped the ball to @entity59 who in turn squared to @entity86 who then offloaded a perfectly weighted ball into the path of @entity47 who finished the move in style			2
there was still time for @entity3 to come back but it was the home side who perhaps should have extended their lead as the visitors pressed forward			2
@entity10 was replaced by @entity97 in the 69th minute but a pair of fresh legs in attack failed to kick - start a revival			1
victory for @entity104 's side sees them move up to second place in the table , one point behind @entity3 who remain on 22 points			0
" we did n't lose our head after losing the early goal , " @entity104 said			0
" i liked many things about the team , above all the high tempo we played with			0
the team recovered well with just two days rest after wednesday and played very well , " he added referring to the @entity118 trip to @entity18 in midweek			0
for @entity10 , the return to action left a " bittersweet " taste in the mouth			0
" i am very happy to return to playing , it is a great relief to have this time behind me , " the @entity125 said			0
" the feeling is bittersweet because of the result but this team has lifted itself many times before			0
