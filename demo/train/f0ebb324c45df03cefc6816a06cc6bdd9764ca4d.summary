@entity0 -- @entity3 issues of unbalanced trade , cyber security and intellectual property rights stand stark in the spotlight at this year 's @entity9 - @entity8 now underway in @entity10 top officials from both sides , including co-chairs @entity9 secretary of state @entity13 and @entity15 's @entity14 , have expressed tempered optimism for " a new chapter " in bilateral ties -- despite recent stumbles			1
the @entity9 has slammed @entity15 on unfair subsidies on solar panels and the theft of secrets owned by @entity9 technology companies			1
@entity15 has returned its own complaints -- most recently after @entity28 leak @entity26 alleged @entity10 has been hacking @entity30 computers			1
yet leaders of both the @entity9 and @entity15 -- the world 's two largest economies -- know their nations are mutually dependent , especially on economy and foreign policy			1
should either party try to distance itself from the other , the result would be mutually detrimental , analysts say			0
" for the @entity9 , the biggest issue is market access to @entity15 and making sure @entity9 companies have a level playing field , " says @entity40 , @entity41 of @entity42 and managing director in @entity0			2
in march , the @entity48 attempted to balance the field on the issue of solar panels			0
@entity10 slapped tariffs on @entity30 - made panels in response to alleged subsidies by @entity56			0
under the ruling , @entity30 panels were hit with tariffs from 2.9 % to 4.7 % , echoing similar spats between @entity15 and @entity61 over solar panels and @entity61 wines			0
the biggest technological thorn in @entity9 - @entity15 ties is " the respect for intellectual property created by @entity9 firms " -- and lack thereof , says @entity69 , @entity70 at @entity72 's @entity71			1
this includes " everything from pirated movies and software to r&d and corporate strategy documents " because " losses will cut into the capacity for additional development if the return on investment is insufficient			0
" in june , the @entity9 @entity84 charged one of @entity15 's biggest wind turbine makers , @entity87 , with stealing source codes from a @entity9 competitor and manufacturing new machines			2
@entity91 claims @entity87 's theft resulted in $ 800 million in losses			0
the @entity9 loses some $ 300 billion each year mostly because of @entity30 intellectual property theft , said former @entity9 ambassador to @entity15 @entity96 to @entity1 in june			1
in addition to @entity100 theft , @entity9 - @entity15 cyber security issues have come to the fore in the past month after @entity28 leak @entity26 alleged @entity9 intelligence agents have been hacking hundreds of @entity30 computers since at least 2009			1
@entity15 claimed @entity26 's revelations would " test developing @entity30 - @entity9 ties " and exacerbate an already " soured relationship " on cybersecurity			1
@entity26 's assertions , on top of alleged @entity30 hacking of @entity9 firms , depict a clear degree of mutual mistrust			2
the majority of headlines in @entity15 since then have referenced " strain , " " tension , " and even " anger " between the @entity9 and @entity15			2
the potential and ease for cyber attacks between the @entity9 and @entity15 will continue to grow , says @entity124 , managing director of @entity56 - based @entity125 and former technology researcher for @entity127			1
" when every physical object has an ip address ... the return on malicious behavior becomes much higher			0
so on both sides -- @entity15 and the @entity9 -- the targets are increasingly attractive			2
" national electrical grids and transportation networks are some of the most attractive marks in each country , adds @entity124			0
" that said , the sky is not falling and i do n't believe we are weeks or months away from a cyberwar with @entity15 that will leave the @entity9 power grid in tatters and the whole country sitting in the dark for months or years			2
" the chances of direct conflict are low , agree analysts			0
economic , military , and technological disparity between the @entity9 and @entity15 is too great			1
@entity15 is not ready for a clash to occur			0
and the @entity9 -- still on the mend from the 2008 financial crisis -- is unlikely to instigate a conflict with @entity15 because of its own fiscal binds to @entity15			1
sentiment from top officials appeared to underline this			0
@entity9 treasury secretary @entity158 told @entity1 's @entity15 's pace toward market - oriented reforms " will probably be slower than we would like " but expects reforms to clearly proceed			1
@entity30 vice-premier @entity163 penned a positive editorial in the @entity165 hoping the @entity9 and @entity15 would " forge a more cooperative relationship			0
he noted that 70 % of @entity9 companies operating in @entity15 made a profit in 2012 , the 1,500 @entity169 in @entity15 have outperformed outlets elsewhere in the world and a flight between the @entity9 and @entity15 now takes off once every 24 minutes .			0
