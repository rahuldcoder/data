-- @entity2 's most enjoyable movie in a long time , " @entity6 " suggests this improbable blockbuster director is at his best when he 's playing to an audience of one : himself			1
it 's never hard to spot @entity2 's signature : the baroque ghoulish visuals , macabre humor and topsy - turvy morality are always front and center			1
@entity13 is usually in there somewhere too			2
but lately @entity2 has seemed more like a stylist or a decorator than a director			1
though his recent movies retain his signature style and visual panache , they seem to lack compelling characters and stories			2
" @entity6 " is different			1
there 's a direct emotional connection			2
this time it 's personal			2
it 's also perfectly scaled			0
@entity30 's witty screenplay is based on a short film @entity2 came up with nearly 30 years ago , the story of a boy who plays @entity34 to try to revive his dead dog			1
the running time has stretched by more than 80 minutes , but that 's still the essence of the new film , a lustrous black and white @entity41 stop - motion animation that doubles as a love letter to old horror movies and a classic boy - and - his - dog story			1
@entity47 ( voiced by @entity48 ) is an introverted youngster , but also an ingenious kid who likes to make monster movies starring his best friend , @entity51			0
encouraged by his dad to get out and play some ball with the other kids , @entity47 enjoys an unexpected moment of glory when he hits a home run			0
but triumph turns to tragedy when @entity51 chases the ball into the street and is struck and killed by a car			0
and that would be that , except that @entity47 's new teacher , mr. @entity64 ( @entity65 ) inspires him to think big for the science fair ; and then there are the electrical storms that are a peculiarity to this otherwise normal small town			0
reveling in the expressionist , shadowy style of early sound films , @entity2 does n't quite match @entity83 's 1930 original " @entity34 " in the resurrection scene , but he does have a lot of fun crafting a contemporary echo chamber in which @entity47 's classmates are shrunken clones of old @entity82 creature feature stalwarts			1
one kid is a gap - toothed , hunchbacked @entity85 ; another is a sinisterly cerebral @entity88 ; then there 's the weird girl who thinks her kitty 's litter carries evil portent			0
creepy as the kids are , the parents are worse , transforming into a lynch mob when their little darlings start taking too much interest in science			0
( they do have a point though : when several assignments get out of hand , the town 's parade turns is crashed by a group of rampaging monsters			0
) but @entity47 is a fine hero , immediately a more sympathetic figure than his famous namesake , and the patched - up @entity51 has personality -- and limbs -- to spare			0
in fact , bits keeping dropping off , and when he takes a drink , he leaks a little , but it 's nothing @entity47 ca n't fix			0
after " @entity117 , " " @entity118 " and " @entity6 " it appears @entity119 has pretty much got the family horror category covered			2
more sensitive children may find the gothic pet cemetery upsetting and freak out at the violent climax			1
@entity2 's film should appeal most to mom and dad , anyone with a soft spot for @entity129 , and twisted teens looking for ideas to reanimate their own science projects			1

a boy who loses his dog brings him back in " @entity6 "
film is based on a short done by director @entity2
more sensitive children may find the gothic pet cemetery upsetting
