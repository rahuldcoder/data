-- many moons ago , when backpacking around @entity2 , i decided to treat myself to a gelato in the @entity6 city of @entity7			2
it had been a few tough days of not really appreciating the art , architecture and history enough -- no matter how many hours i had devoted to museums			2
the feet were sore and the mind was well , over it			0
after all , at some point , ancient cathedrals all start to look the same			0
" how many flavors ? " i was asked			0
the ice cream was beautifully presented in that @entity6 way that makes the gelati look soft , smooth and perplexingly weightless			1
in hindsight , the well - polished checkered tile floor and pristine , clear glass display cabinets should have alerted me that this was no ordinary gelati joint			1
being greedy and indecisive , but mostly greedy , i opted for three			0
the attendant got her gelati scraper spoony thing and proceeded to lavish layer upon layer of lemon , strawberry and pistachio ice cream , to create the @entity34 of cones			1
they got bigger when she asked me to pay			0
the amount , it was lire back then , roughly translated to about $ 30 -- way out of budget for any tight - fisted backpacker , let alone an @entity44			1
the only thing greater than my outrage at the cost was the look of disdain on the attendant 's face when i un-artfully negotiated the cost of the gelato down to around $ 10 ( still way too high in my opinion , but it was a tricky situation and i wanted to pretend i had at least some pride )			1
she artfully negotiated her scraper spoony thing around the ice cream and shaved off way more than two thirds , leaving me with the undernourished , poor cousin of what was once a giant gelato cone			0
do n't order more than you can afford and avoid posh , well - positioned shops near tourist sites			0
and do n't do pistachio			0
among gelati royalty , lemon , or limone , remains king and queen			1
@entity75 tourists stung a similar lesson hit a group of @entity75 tourists this week in @entity79 , according to media reports			1
they got stung 64 euros ( $ 84 ) for four gelati			1
chicken feed , i say when compared to my ice cream incident , at a smidgen over $ 20 per gelato			2
according to one report , the @entity89 managers confirmed the cost of the treats and defended the pricing , saying they were large ice creams			0
" no one forced them to order big ice creams			0
we also serve small ones which only cost â ‚ ¬ 2.50 ( $ 3.30 )			2
but if you want a lot of ice cream then it is worth the price			0
and the prices are displayed everywhere , " a manager told the @entity75 's @entity105			1
according to the report , the tourists coughed up the money			2
" and when we paid up , they did n't even say thank you , " mr @entity110 , of @entity111 was quoted as saying			0
you 'd hope it was pretty tasty			0
this leads to this question , what has been your biggest travel rip off ? sure , we all moan about costs of visas ( i am singling you out , @entity124 and your $ 160 non-refundable visa processing fee			1
oh , and you too , @entity110 $ 250 - a - day @entity130 ) , international phone roaming and hotel @entity127 but often those charges are simply unavoidable			1
it is the ones we are not prepared for , such as a super dooper pricey ice cream cone , that often sting us most			2
we 've all had our own version of the @entity135 of 2000 , so get out the gelati spatula and serve up your greatest , or worst , travel rip off in the comments box below .			1

@entity75 tourists charged $ 84 for four gelati in @entity79
some travel *related* charges like visas are unavoidable
it 's the avoidable rip offs that sting travelers most
