-- more than 250,000 secret @entity2 diplomatic cables are now available in full and unfiltered online , exposing scores of @entity2 diplomatic sources and informants that were meant to be protected often for their own safety , according to the website @entity9			1
but this is not an official @entity9 release			1
rather , what appears to be a string of errors has lead to both the raw file and the password that unlocks that file to be released into the public domain , without @entity9 control			1
in a statement posted on @entity22 , @entity9 said , " guardian investigations editor , @entity24 , recklessly , and without gaining our approval , knowingly disclosed the decryption passwords in a book published by the @entity28			1
" in february , @entity24 released the book " @entity9 : inside @entity31 's @entity30			1
" in it , he describes in detail how @entity9 editor @entity31 gave him the password to unlock the massive archive of diplomatic cables			1
the @entity39 - based @entity28 newspaper responded to the @entity9 tweet with its own statement : " it 's nonsense to suggest the @entity28 's @entity9 book has compromised security in any way			1
our book about @entity9 was published last february			1
it contained a password , but no details of the location of the files , and we were told it was a temporary password which would expire and be deleted in a matter of hours			0
" it was a meaningless piece of information to anyone except the person ( s ) who created the database			0
no concerns were expressed when the book was published and if anyone at @entity9 had thought this compromised security they have had seven months to remove the files			1
that they did n't do so clearly shows the problem was not caused by the @entity28 's book			2
" so how did it happen ? in november , @entity9 announced that it would begin releasing the diplomatic cables together with select media partners , including the @entity28 , @entity71 's @entity70 , @entity73 's @entity72 and @entity75 's @entity74 , among others			1
@entity9 now says it has more than 90 participating media and human rights partners			2
@entity9 shared both the raw file containing the cables and the password with its partners in order for them to jointly comb through the files and research their contents			1
most media , including @entity9 , redacted the material before publishing their findings			2
@entity9 itself promised to publish all of the diplomatic cables on its website but only after vetting the documents and conducting its own " harm minimization " policy of removing any information that might endanger diplomatic sources and informants			1
however , in that process , the raw file was unwittingly posted online by @entity9 supporters and available for anyone to download , according to former @entity9 insider @entity107			1
@entity9 often asks its supporters to help back up its website by downloading and sometimes mirroring the material it has already released			2
" the people releasing the file were not aware of the password issue , and vice versa			0
at least that is how it appears to me , " @entity107 told @entity0			0
" that 's the precise sort of miscommunication that must not happen when dealing with such serious information , and one of the problems that made me and others leave the project			0
" the file was encrypted , so anyone downloading it would not have been able to open it without the password			0
several month later however , according to @entity9 , the @entity28 released that password			2
now , anyone with access to the downloaded file and the password can see all of the unfiltered information from these cables , including protected sources			0
it 's not clear exactly when @entity9 discovered the security breach			2
but in the last week , @entity9 has dramatically sped up the publication of the diplomatic cables			1
before last week , the website had released less than 10 % of the entire cache			0
as of wednesday evening , more than 140,000 had been released , more than half of the entire cache			0
in a statement explaining the sudden rush to publish , @entity9 said it was part of its " commitment to maximizing impact , and making information available to all " -- inviting the public to " crowdsource " the files and post their findings on @entity22 as a form of public journalism			2
@entity9 said wednesday it took " emergency action " two weeks ago in the hopes of preventing the password from being spread			2
that included accelerating its publication schedule " to get as much of the material as possible into the hands of journalists and human rights lawyers who need it			0
" @entity9 also says it contacted the @entity168 to warn the department of the breach			1
according to the statement , @entity9 personnel spoke for 75 minutes with a @entity168 legal advisor by phone , in the hope that the @entity2 government would be able to warn any sources that may be put in danger by the now - public cables			1
@entity168 spokesperson @entity181 said thursday that " @entity9 did advise us of the impending release of information and of its intention to continue to release classified documents			1
" " we have made clear our views and concerns about illegally disclosed classified information and the continuing risk to individuals and national security that such releases cause , " @entity181 said			0
" @entity9 has , however , ignored our requests not to release or disseminate any @entity2 documents it may possess and has continued its well - established pattern of irresponsible , reckless , and frankly dangerous actions			1
we are not cooperating with them			0
" @entity9 denies it is responsible for the security breach			2
in an earlier @entity22 posting , @entity9 said : " there has been no ' leak at @entity9 '			2
the issue relates to a mainstream media partner and a malicious individual			0
" that was a thinly veiled referenced to the @entity28 newspaper and @entity107 , the former @entity9 insider who now runs @entity107 , another whistle - blowing site , and who is currently embroiled in a war of words with @entity31			1
@entity107 told @entity0 that he discovered the security breach " by chance " and alerted his media partner , the @entity71 newspaper @entity220			0
@entity9 blames @entity107 for directing attention to the breach and the @entity28 for leaking the password			1
@entity107 counters that ultimate responsibility lies with @entity9			0
" the password should never have been shared with anyone at all , " he said			0
" this was a fixed agreement within @entity9			0
it was not meant to be given to anyone at all			0
ironically , not even i knew the password or had any access to the data			0
why it had been passed on , only @entity31 ( @entity31 ) knows			0
" @entity31 was not available for comment .			0

new : the @entity168 says it was notified of the problem
thousands of secret @entity2 cables are now online
@entity9 blames the **writer** of a book on @entity9 founder @entity31
" @entity245 , " say the **writer** and his publisher
