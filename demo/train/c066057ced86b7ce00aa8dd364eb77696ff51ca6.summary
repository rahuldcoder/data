weeks of brutal @entity1 strikes on the heavily - populated @entity2 have seen a number of political actors come forward to present a cease - fire plan			0
the deadlock , however , seems to be between @entity7 and @entity8 -- both of whom have considerable leverage over @entity12 , the @entity13 - affiliated group that has ruled @entity2 since 2007			1
the truth is that due to political bias on each side , neither country is fit to be an exclusive mediator in this situation			1
but only one of these two states holds undeniable geographic and political advantages : @entity7 is the only @entity23 state that borders @entity2 , meaning that -- for better or worse -- it is the strip 's only access point to the outside world			0
@entity7 is also the only one of the two that has a direct diplomatic channel with the @entity1 , which is essential to implement any deal			0
during the @entity13 's rule in @entity32 , @entity8 offered @entity7 $ 8 billion in grants and loans , a strategy that may have been well meant , but that ultimately backfired			1
because the @entity13 felt @entity8 was a reliable source of funding , it did n't feel the need to even negotiate a political compromise and economic reform with other factions of @entity7 's political and civil society , which was a condition set by western lenders to extend a $ 4.8 billion loan			1
this expedited the downfall of the group			0
the truth is that @entity8 's overall strategy with the @entity13 has failed miserably : it resulted in the alienation of the @entity13 in @entity7 -- so much so that the group was ousted from power in a popularly - backed military coup , and meant that many @entity7 were indifferent to the bloody massacre of the group 's members that followed			1
@entity8 support for @entity13 affiliates elsewhere in the region , such as @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64 , has also backfired resulting in them being sidelined from power			0
all of this adds to quite an unfortunate year for the @entity69 emirate			0
@entity8 's continuous financial and media support for the @entity13 through the once - popular @entity71 , the 24 - hour , @entity7 - centric @entity72 , which largely reflects a @entity13 perspective , and a slew of new @entity8 - backed @entity13 - affiliated news websites based in @entity77 , have further poisoned relations between @entity8 and @entity7			1
@entity7 's foreign minister recently accused @entity8 and @entity80 of undermining his country 's efforts for a cease - fire in @entity2			1
furthermore , some in @entity7 consider @entity8 's increasingly close ties with @entity80 a liability			1
@entity80 's prime minister @entity87 , who is likely to be the country 's next president , in an interview with @entity91 called @entity7 president @entity92 a " tyrant " adding that @entity7 has no genuine role to play in @entity2			2
there is no doubt that @entity7 will reject any offer it feels will diminish its regional role , especially one coming from @entity8 and @entity80			2
it is ironic , therefore , that the efforts of @entity8 and @entity80 , who both want to see an end to the bloodshed in @entity2 , are self - defeating			0
@entity12 has genuine reasons to reject what are said to be the exact same cease - fire conditions it previously accepted in november 2012 when @entity7 was ruled by its @entity13 affiliates			2
the cost in @entity2 lives this past fortnight has been too high to accept a return to a situation where @entity2 was effectively the world 's largest prison complex , with the lifting and not a mere " easing " of the blockade at minimum			0
@entity8 's move to offer @entity12 a safe refuge after the group decided to leave @entity122 in the wake of the civil war was a strategic move			2
this gave @entity8 a significant advantage over most states in the region -- except , that is , for @entity7			0
@entity8 's recent proposal to finance a commercial port in @entity2 will likely reduce @entity7 control of the movement of individuals , goods and materials in and out of the strip , and is best done with @entity7 's approval and oversight rather than without it			2
in an apparent attempt to placate @entity7 , @entity8 's foreign minister called its role in @entity2 essential , although @entity7 was conspicuously absent from a @entity143 meeting on the current conflict that included @entity8 , @entity80 and some western states			1
@entity7 's absence could perhaps be due to a @entity8 - backed proposal announced by the @entity149 - based former @entity1 mp @entity148 to internationalize the @entity150 and place it under the supervision of the @entity152 and some @entity23 nations			2
@entity8 should not repeat the same mistakes that offered the @entity13 in @entity7 and elsewhere a false sense of omnipotence and infallibility , and should understand that @entity7 's geographical and political leverage trumps any financial and media coverage @entity149 can offer @entity12			1
if the genuine intention is to stop the @entity1 onslaught on @entity2 , @entity149 must concede its soft power to @entity32 's hard power			0
the sooner @entity8 realizes this , the sooner the horrible @entity2 conflict will come to an end .			0
