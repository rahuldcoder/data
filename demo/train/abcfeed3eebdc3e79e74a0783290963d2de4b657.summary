@entity1 owner @entity0 is banned from the @entity2 for life			0
@entity0 has confirmed it is his voice expressing racist views on audio of a private conversation that was leaked to the media			1
some who have followed @entity11 over the years say he had shown this side before and the leaked audio led to public outcry too loud for the @entity2 commissioner to ignore			0
but what of the recording itself ? was it legal to record ? to leak ? here 's a look at some of the legal aspects of the recorded conversation between @entity0 and his alleged mistress , @entity24 , who said she recorded the conversation			1
was it legal to record the conversation ? it depends what state you are in during the conversation			1
most states require that only one person have knowledge that a conversation is being recorded for it to be legal			1
but some states , like @entity35 , are " two - party consent " states where all of those involved in the conversation have to know they are being recorded for it to be legal			1
so depending on the location of the recording , if @entity0 did n't know he was being recorded , the audio might very well have been obtained illegally			1
@entity24 's lawyer , however , told the @entity44 that @entity0 knew he was being recorded			0
the lawyer , @entity45 , declined to tell the @entity44 why @entity24 recorded the conversation , but said it was " by mutual agreement , " he told the @entity44			2
@entity49 good for @entity2 's bottom line was it legal to leak the audio ? though some may question the ethics of the act , if the audio was legally obtained , no laws were violated by leaking it to a reporter			1
the reporters who received the audio and disseminated its contents to the public also did nothing illegal , said @entity65 , a @entity66 attorney with expertise in @entity68 and media law			2
@entity24 's lawyer has said that @entity24 was not the one who released the audio to the media			2
@entity1 unite and win was this a @entity68 violation ? have @entity0 's first amendment rights been violated ? no , @entity65 said			0
no one is questioning that @entity49 has the right to speak as he pleases , but the public and the @entity2 are also free to condemn what he says , @entity65 said			0
@entity79 , a @entity80 - based @entity68 attorney , wrote in an op - ed for @entity82 that the @entity2 is private club and can punish @entity0 as it sees fit			0
but , @entity79 wrote , it was morally wrong to leak the audio and violate @entity49 's privacy			2
we all say things in private that we may not say in public , he said , but " we now live in a world where if you have any views that are unpopular , you now not only need to fear saying them in public , but you need to fear saying them at all -- even to your intimate friends			0
" opinion : what happened to @entity0 was morally wrong who wants to buy out a billionaire ?			0

legality of @entity49 recording depends on state where it was recorded
some states require one recorded party to know , some require all
it is not illegal to release a legally obtained audio of private conversation to media
