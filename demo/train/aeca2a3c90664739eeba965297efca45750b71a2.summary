@entity0 -- in the wake of the deadly @entity5 cruise ship accident off the coast of @entity7 in january , the cruise industry is implementing new safety standards			1
@entity9 , the world 's largest cruise non-profit organization representing 26 companies , announced tuesday it is putting in place standards it says will " achieve concrete , practical and significant safety dividends in the shortest possible time			1
" officials say each ship will now be required to provide additional adult life jackets in excess of the legal requirements within a ship 's most - populated zone			2
this will ensure the number of life jackets carried by a cruise liner will exceed the actual number of passengers on board			1
at least 30 people were killed and two others are missing and presumed dead after the @entity5 struck rocks and turned on its side january 13 off the @entity35 island of @entity36			1
some survivors said they returned to their rooms to get their life jackets a half hour after the accident and struggled to climb many levels in dim emergency lighting on the listing ship to reach lifeboats			2
the industry also adopted a policy to " minimize unnecessary disruptions and distractions " on the bridge			1
the change will limit access to the bridge " to those with operational functions during any period of restricted maneuvering or when increased vigilance is required			0
" the captain of the @entity5 faces allegations of manslaughter , causing the shipwreck , abandoning ship and failing to report the accident			1
some media outlets reported that capt. @entity65 had a woman with him on the bridge just before the accident			0
@entity70 has previously said managers of the cruise line instructed him to sail close to @entity36			2
he said the ship hit a rock not indicated on charts of the area			2
a third safety policy adopted involves passage planning procedures , which is the complete description of a ship 's movement from departure to arrival			0
the new standard will change what was simply guidance for years and make it a mandatory minimum requirement			0
all bridge team members will be briefed on the voyage " well in advance of its implementation " by a designated officer and approved by the master			0
" as the @entity65 incident demonstrates , there is no such thing as perfect safety , " said @entity94 , chairman of the @entity95			0
" we do strive for a perfect commitment to safety			0
