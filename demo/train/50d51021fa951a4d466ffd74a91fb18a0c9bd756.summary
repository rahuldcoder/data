-- huge crowds in the @entity2 cheered pope @entity3 on wednesday as he made his first public appearance since announcing his resignation at the end of the month			1
he thanked the @entity8 faithful in several languages and said it was not appropriate for him to continue as pope			2
" i 've decided to resign the ministry given to me by the @entity13			0
i 've done this in full freedom , for the benefit of the church , " he told those gathered in a @entity16 audience hall for his regular weekly appearance			0
@entity3 said he is fully aware of the gravity of his decision but he could not carry on as pope " if i do n't have the strength that it requires			1
" he appeared tired but not visibly unwell as he sat and read his remarks off several sheets of paper			0
@entity3 later celebrated an @entity31 mass that marked the beginning of @entity33 at @entity34 in the afternoon			1
opinion : why pope will be remembered for generations the service was moved from @entity40 , where it is traditionally held , to the @entity34 to accommodate the larger crowd of worshipers , @entity2 officials said			1
news monday that @entity3 was stepping down at the end of february " because of advanced age " shocked the world 's 1.2 billion @entity8			1
he is the first pope to resign in nearly 600 years			0
@entity3 will keep working until february 28 , meeting with pastors from @entity50 , @entity52 bishops , and the visiting presidents of @entity54 , @entity55 and other countries , according to the @entity2 press office			1
he will hold a final audience in @entity16 's @entity60 on february 27 , but the church is not planning a formal ceremony to mark the pope 's departure , the rev. @entity58 , a spokesman for the @entity2 , said wednesday			1
@entity3 will simply leave at the end of his typical workday -- 8 p.m. in @entity16 , @entity58 said			2
the pontiff , born @entity3 , will first go to the pope 's summer residence in @entity70 , and then is likely to retire to a monastery and devote himself to a life of reflection and prayer , @entity58 said			1
he wo n't be involved in managing the church after his resignation			0
" the pope is well and his soul is serene			0
he did not resign the pontificate because he is ill but because of the fragility that comes with old age , " @entity58 said			0
@entity2 secretary of state @entity83 on wednesday thanked @entity3 for his service			1
" all of us have understood that it is precisely the deep love that your holiness has for @entity90 and the church which pushed you to this act , " he said			0
the pope 's decision was not linked to a recent medical intervention to replace the battery in his pacemaker , @entity58 said , adding that it had been a routine procedure			0
@entity3 's unexpected move has inevitably prompted frenzied speculation over who might assume the papacy in his place			2
opinion : huge challenges await next pope the @entity2 does not yet know when the cardinals will meet in a conclave to decide who will replace @entity3 , but it must begin within 20 days of the pope 's resignation , @entity58 said			1
he had previously said a new pope would be in place before @entity114 is celebrated at the end of march			2
while @entity3 wo n't be directly involved in his successor 's selection , his influence will undoubtedly be felt			1
he appointed 67 of the 117 cardinals who are set to make the decision			0
the number of electors could drop to 115 , as two cardinals will turn 80 in march , when their age makes them ineligible to cast a vote			1
more than two - thirds of the final number of cardinals must agree on the next pope			2
the announcement that a decision has been made will come in the form of a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney in the @entity2			2
much speculation has focused on whether @entity3 's successor might come from @entity137 or @entity138 , rather than @entity139 , where @entity8 congregations are shrinking			2
the pope 's older brother , the rev. @entity141 , speaking in @entity143 , @entity144 , said he expected to see a pope chosen from outside @entity139 one day -- but not just yet			1
" i 'm certain a pope will come from the new continents but whether it will be now , i have my doubts , " he said			0
" in @entity139 , we have many very able people , and the @entity137 are still not so well known and maybe do not have the experience yet			0
" opinion : echoes of past in pope 's resignation among those considered front - runners for the role are cardinal @entity161 , archbishop of @entity162 ; @entity164 cardinal @entity163 , who heads the @entity2 's office of bishops ; cardinal @entity167 , an @entity168 ; and cardinal @entity169 of @entity170			1
whoever gets the nod , the selection of a new pontiff is expected to go smoothly			0
" we 're not going to have a problem of two competing popes			0
if pope @entity3 still wanted to have influence , he would n't have stepped down , " said senior @entity2 communications adviser @entity178			1
while not quite unprecedented , @entity3 's resignation is certainly historic			2
the last pope to step down before his death was @entity185 , who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope			0
@entity0 's @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
