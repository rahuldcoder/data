@entity5 ( called @entity5 in @entity1 ) is a six - wheeled lunar rover equipped with at least four cameras and two mechanical legs that can dig up soil samples to a depth of 30 meters			1
the solar - powered rover will patrol the moon 's surface , studying the structure of the lunar crust as well as soil and rocks , for at least three months			1
the robot 's name was decided by a public online poll and comes from a @entity1 myth about the pet white rabbit of a goddess , @entity24 , who is said to live on the moon			0
weighing 140 kilograms , the slow - moving rover carries an optical telescope for astronomical observations and a powerful ultraviolet camera that will monitor how solar activity affects the various layers -- troposphere , stratosphere and ionosphere -- that make up the @entity38 's atmosphere , @entity1 's information technology ministry said in a statement			2
the @entity5 is also equipped with radioisotope heater units , allowing it to function during the cold lunar nights when temperatures plunge as low as -180 ° @entity43 )			0
the moon exploration makes @entity1 one of only three nations -- after the @entity47 and the @entity48 -- to " soft - land " on the moon 's surface , and the first to do so in more than three decades			1
@entity1 's space program @entity1 has rapidly built up its space program since it first sent an astronaut into space in 2003			1
in 2012 , the country conducted 18 space launches , according to the @entity57			0

but scientists in the @entity47 have expressed concern that the @entity2 mission could skew the results of a @entity76 study of the moon 's dust environment			0
the spacecraft 's descent is likely to create a noticeable plume on the moon 's surface that could interfere with research already being carried out by @entity76 's @entity85 ( @entity85 ) , @entity86 , chair of @entity76 's @entity87 told news site @entity89 in november			2
the @entity2 spacecraft blasted off from a @entity92 rocket in @entity1 's @entity93 on december 2 and reached the moon 's orbit at 100 kilometers ( about 60 miles ) from its surface less than five days later			1
on tuesday , it descended into an elliptical orbit with its lowest point just 15 kilometers off the lunar surface , a spokesperson for @entity1 's @entity102 told @entity103			1
the @entity48 's @entity105 probe was the last space mission to land on the moon in august 1976 -- four years after the @entity47 launched the manned @entity109 mission			0
@entity110 claims second launch of monkey into space and back			0
