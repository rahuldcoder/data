@entity0 -- @entity1 hated the young man as soon as he saw him			1
@entity1 at a @entity4 coal mine prison camp in 1944			1
the man 's almond - shaped eyes , dark hair and olive skin -- @entity1 had seen those @entity10 facial features before			1
he saw that face when he watched @entity4 soldiers behead sick men begging for water , run over stumbling prisoners with tanks and split his comrades ' skulls with rifle butts			2
" men died like flies , " @entity1 says			1
" i thought for a while i would never make it			2
" @entity1 , now 91 , is one of the last survivors of the @entity25			1
during @entity27 , the @entity4 army forced @entity29 and @entity30 prisoners of war on a march so horrific that the @entity4 commander was later executed for war crimes			1
@entity1 returned home to @entity36 after the war to teach , but he still had something to learn			1
when he saw a young @entity4 - @entity29 student seated in his class one day , he felt both anger and anguish			2
what , he wondered , do i do with all of the hate i 've brought home with me ? ' the worst war story ' he ever heard @entity1 's answer to that question can be found in the new book " @entity51 , " a searing depiction of the @entity25			1
the book details how @entity1 found help through an unlikely source			1
but he would first have to survive one of the worst defeats in @entity29 military history			0
in december 1941 , @entity4 forces attacked an army of @entity29 and @entity30 soldiers in the @entity30 and forced them to surrender			2
they captured 76,000 prisoners , double what they had expected			0
the @entity4 forced the @entity64 to march 66 miles under a tropical sun to a railway station for transport			2
they shot , bayoneted and beat to death prisoners who could n't keep pace			0
at least 7,000 soldiers died during the march			2

" what they [ the @entity4 ] did was monstrous			0
" prisoners were forced to bury others alive and work as slave laborers ; some were executed for sport			2
one @entity4 soldier , who later became a @entity89 priest , told the authors that he is still haunted by what he did on @entity93			0
some @entity30 who live today near the march 's route say that they , too , can not forget what happened , @entity94 says			2
" they would tell us that when they lay awake at night , they thought they could still hear the trampling of the men 's feet on the death march , " she says			1

the march is told through his eyes and drawings			0
@entity1 was a cowboy from @entity36 who could ride a horse , rope cattle and shoot by the time he was 8 years old			1
" i thought that if anybody gets out of here , i 'm going to be one of them , " says @entity1 , who was a 22 - year - old @entity113 private when he was captured			1
at times , though , @entity1 wondered whether he was being too optimistic			1
he was bayoneted , starved and beaten			0
he was constantly ill , and his weight fell to 112 pounds			0
@entity1 found a way to preserve his mind even as his body wasted away : he drew			1

" @entity1 meets his ' nemesis ' @entity1 's hatred smoldered for 15 years			1
it threatened to spill out into the open in 1960 , when he walked into his classroom on the first day of the semester and saw a @entity4 - @entity29 student			0
in " @entity77 , " @entity1 says that his " heart hardened and filled with hate			1
" but he was so anguished by what he was feeling , he returned to his office after class to think			0
he told himself that the war was over ; he was n't a prisoner anymore , and he had to treat the @entity4 - @entity29 student like anybody else , because he was an @entity29 , too			2
then he did something else			0
he invited the student to his office for a talk			0
the student 's name was @entity157 , and he , too , had been marked by the war			1
his family had been imprisoned at a " relocation camp " in @entity161 during the war			2
@entity1 also discovered that he and @entity157 had something else in common : a passion for drawing @entity36 's rural life			1
by the end of the semester , @entity157 was one of @entity1 's best students			1
@entity1 says that talking to @entity157 helped his hatred evaporate			1
" we had a discussion and finally came to an understanding that we liked each other , " he says			0
today , @entity1 and @entity157 remain in touch			1
" we 're the best of friends , " @entity157 tells @entity0 from his @entity36 art studio			0
" we see each other regularly			0
" @entity157 says he ca n't remember exactly what he and @entity178 talked about first , only that @entity1 had always treated him well			2
@entity1 did tell him later that their relationship helped him recover from the war , he says			1
" i was just there , " @entity157 says			0
" i just happened to be there for him to use my presence as a way to overcome his dark time			0
" @entity157 says he is still amazed by @entity1 's survival story			1
" just to be a part of his life is an honor , " @entity157 says			0
@entity1 's voice is still strong and his mind sharp			1
he 's been married to his wife , @entity194 , for 57 years , and they have three children and six grandchildren			2
@entity1 says @entity93 taught him to treasure small pleasures , like a drink of cool water and a warm bed at night			2

" i can remember when that plate was empty			0
" he still remembers tiny details from the death march as well			0
