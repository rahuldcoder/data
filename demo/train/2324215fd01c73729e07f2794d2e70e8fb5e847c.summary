-- the head of @entity3 football has told players not to walk off the pitch if they are racially abused , saying any decision to stop a match should be left to the referee			1
@entity11 president @entity10 's comments come just one week after @entity13 striker @entity12 , who was subjected to " monkey chants " in a recent match against @entity16 , told @entity0 he would leave the pitch if he was abused in future			1
@entity12 's teammate @entity19 walked off the field during an exhibition match against a fourth division team in january and while @entity10 support 's @entity19 's decision , it is a situation he is keen not to see repeated			1
" it 's not a matter for the player to regulate the game and to stop the game ; it 's a matter for the referee , " @entity10 , who has been president of @entity3 football 's governing body since 2007 , told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			1
" it 's not normal that people in 2013 are being insulted about their color , about the difference of color			0
it 's very tough for the player on the field			0
" but @entity10 fears that if a team is " not happy " and is losing a match its players could decide to leave the field for reasons that might having nothing to do with racist abuse			1
on thursday , @entity11 announced a raft of new racism regulations -- part closures of stadiums , match abandonments and full stadium closures in the event of discriminatory chanting			2
clubs would be handed a fine of $ 65,000 , a figure which has drawn criticism as being too meager for football teams which are multi-million dollar businesses			0
but @entity10 defended the severity of that financial sanction			2
" it 's not a question of money , " explained the @entity70 , who said clubs are often left in a difficult position when trying to deal with fans who attend games armed with political agendas			2
in the past @entity10 has also faced criticism for his stance on goal - line technology ( @entity82 ) , with the @entity70 often portrayed as a " luddite " for opposing the use of a system which @entity86 has embraced			1
@entity82 debuted at last year 's @entity87 and is set for another run out in june 's @entity89 in @entity90			0
but the 57 - year - old @entity10 defended his position , insisting money should be spent on developing the game at grassroots level rather than @entity82			2
" it will cost me $ 67 million to have @entity82 , " continued @entity10 , who was crowned @entity95 in 1984			2
" i have to put it in all the games in the @entity99 and all the games in the @entity101			0
i have to put it in @entity103 , in @entity104 and in @entity105			0
" it costs me $ 67 million , for one goal , two goals a year ? i prefer to invest that for the use football in the grassroots			0
" championed as a possible successor to @entity86 president @entity113 at the next election in 2015 , @entity10 would not be drawn on whether he has ambitions to succeed the 77 - year - old @entity116			1
" he will be 79 , " said @entity10			0
referring to how old @entity113 will be at @entity86 's next presidential elections			0
" if he thinks it 's time to stop , it 's up to him			0
" if @entity10 does succeed @entity113 as head of football 's global governing body , one item on his agenda will be the @entity126 in @entity127 , particularly with regard to what time of the year that tournament should be staged			1
fears have been raised over playing the tournament in its usual june - july slot , which would see players compete in high temperatures			0
@entity10 has long been an advocate of playing the tournament in the @entity3 winter , a proposal which has been met with staunch opposition as it would disrupt the traditional season for @entity11 's major leagues			1
" if i am president of @entity86 or not president of @entity86 , " declared @entity10 , " i will always support we have to play in winter			1

@entity10 urges players not to walk off the pitch if racially abused
the @entity11 president insists the decision to stop a match rests with referees
the @entity70 also reiterates his stance against goal - line technology
@entity10 remains behind the @entity126 in 2022 being played in winter
