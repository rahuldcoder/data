responding to allegations , @entity1 police chief @entity0 said monday that officials did not restrict airspace over @entity5 , @entity6 , to block media coverage of protests			1
rather , he said , the temporary restriction was about protecting both those in the air and on the ground			0
" it 's always all about safety , " @entity0 told reporters			2
" we do n't have the ability to preclude people out of there for any other reason other than that			0
had we just wanted to move the media away from this arena we would have started that on the ground , and that 's not what happened , " he said			0
the chief spoke one day after the @entity28 reported that the no - fly zone was aimed at the media -- a story a @entity32 alderman described as " disturbing			1
" the report only further hurt the already damaged trust between residents and authorities , @entity32 alderman @entity33 told @entity38			2
the @entity28 's story , he said , " shows that there seemed to be an active campaign to keep what was happening out of the spotlight , to suppress media coverage " of demonstrations and riots in @entity5 following the police shooting of @entity48 , a black teenager who witnesses say had his arms up and was surrendering when a white police officer shot him august 9			1
authorities contend that @entity48 attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun			1
the @entity57 also commented on the @entity28 story , noting that the flight restrictions were temporary			1
" in this case , what the @entity60 says is that they took the prudent step of implementing this temporary flight restriction in the immediate aftermath of reports of shots fired at a police helicopter , " press secretary @entity69 said , " but within 12 to 14 hours , that flight restriction was updated in a way to remove restrictions for reporters who were seeking to operate in the area			1
" @entity0 stressed that the temporary flight restriction did not prohibit all flights at all altitudes			2
police , for example , continued to fly , even though doing so was not 100 % safe , the chief said			2
he also underscored that there were threats from credible sources suggesting certain groups were targeting helicopters with rifles and lasers			0
" at no time ... did we request that only media be kept out of the airspace and , again , i would like to reiterate that the @entity60 contacted us regarding the amount of air traffic that was in that location , " @entity0 said			0
keeping the media out ? @entity48 's shooting sparked a federal civil rights inquiry and a grand jury investigation			1
in the immediate days after @entity48 's killing , an intense national spotlight shone on the @entity32 suburb			1
a rush of media went to @entity5			2
several journalists were arrested , and law enforcement officers were seen and heard on video harassing members of the media			0
an @entity106 correspondent told @entity38 's @entity107 that he felt rubber bullets and tear gas were shot at his crew intentionally			0
journalists arrested in @entity5 at the time , police requested a restriction of airspace surrounding @entity5 , and the @entity60 agreed to it for safety reasons			1
but according to recorded telephone conversations that @entity28 obtained , the ban was aimed at keeping news helicopters from flying over @entity5			1
on august 12 , the morning after the @entity60 imposed the first flight ban , @entity60 air traffic managers tried to redefine the flight ban so that police helicopters and commercial flights running at nearby @entity126 - @entity125 could fly , according to @entity28 they were struggling to explain how those flights were cleared to fly , but others were not , the news agency said			1
" they finally admitted it really was to keep the media out , " said one @entity60 manager about the @entity130 in a series of recorded telephone conversations that @entity28 has			1
@entity28 reported that a manager at the @entity60 's @entity137 center said police " did not care if you ran commercial traffic through this @entity140 ( temporary flight restriction ) all day long			1
they did n't want media in there			0
" " there is really ... no option for a @entity140 that says , you know , ' ok , everybody but the media is ok , ' " the manager said , the @entity28 reported			2
the managers then crafted wording they felt would keep news helicopters out of the controlled zone but not interfere with other air traffic , according to @entity28 @entity60 's response to @entity38 @entity38 asked the @entity60 about the @entity28 story and received a written statement that read , in part : " @entity60 can not and will never exclusively ban media from covering an event of national significance and media was never banned from covering the ongoing events in @entity5 in this case			1
" on monday , @entity166 , the @entity32 alderman , told @entity38 : " when you take these new facts and add them to what we saw -- the targeting of journalists including violence perpetuated toward journalists -- this ( the new allegation involving the @entity60 and police ) is not the kind of thing that you 'd think would happen in our country			1
" the alderman said he hoped the @entity28 story will ignite a conversation or some kind of probe			2
" we really need to find out what was behind this , who was behind this , who authorized this , is this kind of thing done regularly ? " @entity33 said			0
" when things like this happen it 's about how we ( local leaders ) respond to it			0
" @entity166 noted that he can urge an investigation -- but he 's a city representative , not a county one , and does n't have the authority to demand a probe , he said			0
the flight restrictions were lifted on august 22 , the @entity28 report said , citing records			1
in its statement to @entity38 , the @entity60 said : " there is nothing more important to the @entity60 than the safety of the @entity208 and people on the ground			0
when local law enforcement reports a danger to aircraft , including guns fired into the air that could impact low flying aircraft , the @entity60 will always err on the side of safety			0
" it continues , " when requested and no safety or security issues exist , the @entity60 actively facilitates media access to airspace , making provisions that allow properly accredited media representatives to operate inside the boundaries of temporarily restricted airspace through proper coordination with air traffic controllers or other appropriate officials			1
to the best of our knowledge , during the 11 day period flight restrictions of varying levels were in place , no media outlets objected to any of the restrictions			0
" a violation of the @entity240 ? the @entity241 weighed in on the @entity28 story monday			2
" just as the @entity241 and @entity241 of @entity6 are working to protect the rights of protesters on the ground , we will protect them in the air as well , " said @entity243 , a staff attorney at the @entity241 's @entity245 headquarters			1
she serves as lead counsel in federal @entity255 cases			0
" it 's very troubling to the @entity241 and it should be extremely troubling to anyone in the public who wants to get news about what their government is up to , " she said			2
" this was a no - fly zone targeted at the media and it appears it was not for safety purposes			0
if indeed the air restrictions were only to keep the media out , it is a constitutional violation of the @entity270			0
" complete coverage of @entity5			0
