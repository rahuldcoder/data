@entity0 -- @entity3 's ribbing of @entity6 gov. @entity5 's scientific views seemed to strike a nerve , leading the potential @entity9 presidential contender to jab back wednesday over @entity10 that the comedian is " no @entity12			1
" in a series of four tweets -- three of which included links to @entity3 's segment -- @entity5 said he missed the bit because he was " too busy pulling out pages on evolution in my kids ' biology textbooks			1
" but , he said , " if evolution was true , " @entity3 's humor would n't be " so far behind " @entity12 's			1
@entity3 on tuesday night mocked @entity5 -- who studied biology at @entity25 , became a @entity26 and ran the @entity27 -- for evading questions about his own views on evolution			1
he pointed to @entity5 's comments at a @entity33 breakfast two weeks ago , where he said : " i will tell you , as a father , i want my kids to be taught about evolution in their schools , but secondly , i think local school districts should make the decision			0
" @entity3 said @entity5 's academic pedigree could haunt him in a @entity9 presidential primary , but that his comments on evolution show he 's " off to an impressive retreat from knowledge			2
" the comedian was mocking @entity5 's appearance at last weekend 's @entity49 , where the @entity6 governor earned 3 percent support among 2016 @entity9 presidential contenders in a straw poll -- behind the option " none / no one , " which drew 4 percent support			2
" i applaud @entity5 for so deftly floating this presidential trial balloon , " @entity3 said			0
" but please do n't call it that , sir , because the science is n't in on ballooning yet			0
i mean , if hot air rises , how come hell is below us ? "			0

@entity3 mocked @entity6 gov. @entity5 for answers on his *beliefs* on evolution .
@entity5 hit back that @entity3 's humor would n't *lag* so far behind @entity12 's " if evolution was true . "
