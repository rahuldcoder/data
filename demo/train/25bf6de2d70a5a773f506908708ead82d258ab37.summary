@entity3 , seeking a fourth successive league title , now can not afford to slip up in sunday 's trip to city rivals @entity12			1

it was @entity1 's 14th win in 17 league games for a total of 43 points from a possible 51 , with 61 goals for and 16 against			2
@entity17 opened the scoring after 20 minutes after @entity18 and @entity28 combined well inside the box , but 14th - placed @entity9 surprisingly leveled soon after as @entity30 headed in a cross by @entity32 forward @entity33			1
who will be january 's top transfer targets ? @entity7 defender @entity35 restored the home side 's advantage as he powerfully nodded in @entity39 's 34th - minute corner , and @entity41 forward @entity40 made it 3 - 1 straight after the break with his 13th league goal this season after fullback @entity46 was allowed to surge into the box			1
@entity17 made it safe in the 50th minute as the @entity49 forward controlled @entity50 's lofted diagonal pass and fired in a low shot for his 10th in @entity6 and 16th overall			2
@entity18 finally got on the scoresheet with a minute of regulation time remaining , as the world 's most expensive player -- who is on the shortlist for the @entity60 award to be named on monday -- fired in from the edge of the penalty area			0
that took the @entity65 captain four goals clear of @entity3 's @entity67 , who is hoping to win his third successive world player of the year title			2
fourth - placed @entity70 face the prospect of losing ground on @entity73 after being held to a 0 - 0 draw by visiting @entity75			1

@entity87 can leapfrog the @entity89 - based side with victory at @entity91 on sunday			0
@entity92 also had the chance to claim fifth by beating @entity94 in saturday 's late match , but there were no goals in that game either and the home side had to settle for going a point above @entity87 into sixth			0
@entity102 moved above second - bottom @entity103 , @entity79 and @entity104 with a 1 - 0 victory at home to @entity107 that lifted the @entity108 out of the relegation zone			0
