-- let 's be clear about one thing : vice president @entity4 's recent comment about being ok with marriage equality did not place the president in a difficult situation			1
the president placed the president in a difficult situation the day he decided to push his conscience back into the closet			2
in 1996 , when @entity13 first ran for state office , he was in support of marriage equality			1
but once he started targeting the national stage , he became less supportive			0
today he says he 's " evolving , " which seems to be shorthand for , " back off , i do n't want to lose this election			2
" to be fair , @entity13 's not the first politician to rewrite his history for political gain and he certainly wo n't be the last ( right , @entity23 )			1
and without question @entity13 has done more to help the gay community than any other president			1
but this awkward dance he 's doing with the issue of same - sex marriage is a self - inflicted wound to his integrity			1
all @entity4 did was speak from the heart			2
just because the president lacks the fortitude to do the same does not mean the campaign should try to massage @entity4 's words to mean something other than their original intent			1
besides , @entity4 's comments , along with education secretary @entity40 , may feel good , but they 're not moving any needles			1
there is no real pressure the gay community can put on the president , because the reality is the gay community does n't have any leverage			1
it 's either @entity13 or the guy who vows to push a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriages			1
no , the only question is how many days president @entity13 will allow his legacy to reside on the wrong side of history			1
how many pages of his future biographies does he want dedicated to him not supporting this issue ? thirty years from now , when the @entity0 specials are aired and the documentaries made , how much footage does @entity13 want his grandchildren to see of him ... " evolving " ? because at this point , that 's what it all boils down to , the choice to be politically savvy versus the choice to follow the heart of the man who on more than one occasion quoted the rev. @entity75 in saying " justice delayed is justice denied			1
" it 's an extremely difficult position to be in , but @entity4 and @entity40 and the @entity79 , and @entity80 , none of them put the president in that position			1
he did it to himself and only he can get himself out			0
if he 's so inclined			2
in the @entity88 series , " @entity94 " , there was a powerful character who often drew praiseâ € ” from foe and ally alikeâ € ” for his honesty and integrity			0
that character , @entity95 , was also called a fool , and eventually was beheaded in front of a cheering crowd before the end of the first season			0
you see in the game of thrones , it 's more advantageous to be perceived as a man of honor than to actually be one			2
and when you realize how many lies , concessions and deals are necessary to become president , then you realize the race to the @entity114 is nothing but a real life game of thrones			1
@entity13 could come out in support of marriage equality and then see if the recent @entity120 poll showing more @entity121 support marriage equality than oppose it is actually true			1
that would be the honorable -- and foolish -- thing to do			0
or he could wait to see if he 's re-elected first before announcing he 's finally evolved			0
obviously , he would be taken to task for waiting so long to voice support for marriage equality , but it would also be obvious why he did			2
there was a story in the april 20 edition of @entity132 that featured four black pastors who aligned themselves with conservatives over the issue of marriage equality			0
one of those churches , @entity138 in @entity139 , is in @entity140 , the state that is going to the polls on tuesday to decide whether to add an amendment banning same - sex marriages to its state constitution			1
the amendment would also ban " civil unions " and " domestic partnerships "			0
is throwing support behind equality worth alienating voters ? maybe not			0
during a recent campaign stop in @entity140 , the president did n't bring the measure up			0
but he has called the @entity153 unconstitutional , wants it repealed and supports the @entity154			0
oh so close , is n't he ? and yet , no one is sorta married			0
you either are or you are n't and most gay people are not , can not get married			0
as a result , loving , committed couples pay more in taxes because they ca n't file jointly or sometimes are unable to cover their family with work issued health insurance			0
all on @entity13 's watch			1
funny ... barely a week has passed since introducing the new campaign slogan " forward " and yet @entity13 seems content to be in this hypocritical holding pattern on this particular issue			2
i guess he 's no @entity95			0
for better and for worse			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

@entity4 's comment about *approving* of same - sex marriage *downplayed* by @entity114
@entity172 says @entity13 put himself in a fix by ending his support for gay marriage
he says @entity13 may be right in thinking support of same - sex marriage could hurt at the polls
@entity172 : does president want to be on the wrong side of history ?
