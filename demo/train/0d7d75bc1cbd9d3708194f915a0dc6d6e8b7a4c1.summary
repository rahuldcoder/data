at this point , @entity3 is neither confirming nor denying that @entity5 , @entity6 , and @entity7 are returning for " @entity8 : @entity9 " but if director @entity10 wants to bring back the original - trilogy trio , @entity5 and @entity6 are almost certainly on board			1
the question mark has always been @entity14 , who has spent most of his post- " @entity8 " career expressing mild - to - aggressive embarrassment about the franchise			0
but @entity7 's feelings towards " @entity8 " have warmed in recent years			1
perhaps @entity14 , who turned 70 last year , views " @entity9 " as a chance to burnish his reputation by returning to one of his most beloved characters			2
also , money is nice			0
whatever the reason , even though the next film is still early in the development process , @entity7 gave a rather bold ( for him ) statement to @entity32 's @entity31 yesterday			1
' @entity34 ' actors do theme song when asked by reporter @entity36 if @entity14 is reuniting with his original castmates for the next movie , @entity14 responded : " i think it 's almost true			1
" ' @entity41 ' boss tells ' decoy ' tales he added , " i 'm looking forward to it , " sounding like a man who was really looking forward to his next root canal			0
he ultimately hedged that it 's " not in the bag yet , but i think it 's happening			2
