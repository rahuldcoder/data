as a school nurse in @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity0 has more than 15,000 students in 23 buildings under her care			1
she works out of the district 's administrative offices and spends her days giving powerpoint presentations to educators and communicating with parents over the phone			1
" [ it is ] scary the fact that i 'm responsible for so many schools , " @entity13 said			0
" i miss being ' nurse @entity0			2
' " the 16 - year veteran has seen a lot of changes during her career as a nationally certified school nurse , but most notable is the shrinking ranks of her colleagues			1
@entity3 has the highest student - to - school nurse ratio in the country at 4,411 to 1 , according to the @entity26			1
@entity27 is n't far behind , with a ratio of 3,637 to 1			2
this means nurses are handling bigger caseloads , @entity13 said , while students ' medical needs are becoming more complex			1
and educators are now the ones doling out daily medication			0
it 's not all bad news , said @entity39 , president of the @entity26			0
overall , there has been an increase in funded school nurse positions in the @entity43 in the last decade			1
but the numbers vary significantly by state , and some districts have no school nurses at all			2
the bottom line , @entity48 said , is that the school nurse 's job tends to be at risk during budget cut time			1
" the big question for parents to ask when they drop their child off at school is , ' who 's going to be taking care of my kid 's health care needs ? ' " @entity48 said			1
" ' what if my child gets sick ? who 's going to take care of them ? what are their qualifications ? ' that 's an important question for parents to ask , and the school needs to have the answers			1
" it was certainly a question @entity74 asked when she and her husband moved their three children to @entity78 , @entity79			0
their 8 - year - old daughter , @entity80 , has type 1 diabetes and celiac disease			2
the first requires constant monitoring of @entity80 's blood glucose levels ; the second a gluten - free diet			2
" our school nurse has been invaluable , " @entity74 said			1
" insulin is a really tricky hormone -- a little in either direction can have drastic results			0
in reality , it could kill her			0
i would be very , very nervous sending her to a school environment for a large chunk of her day [ with ] no one there to monitor her			0
" ever year before school starts , @entity74 meets with @entity80 's nurse , a member of the administration and all the educators she will be encountering -- from the art teacher to the librarian			1
a registered nurse herself , @entity74 had no qualms about putting up fliers around the school with her daughter 's photo that said , " my name is @entity80			1
i have diabetes " to alert staff if they noticed her wandering around looking confused because of low blood sugar			0
one in every 400 children has type 1 diabetes , according to the @entity124 , and children are more frequently developing type 2 diabetes , normally an adult disease linked to obesity			0
in addition , the prevalence of reported food allergies in children increased 18 % between 1997 and 2007			0
that 's not to mention children with asthma or mental health issues			2
often , the people administering medication in schools are secretaries , principals or teachers			0
they 're given instructions by parents or the district 's supervising nurse but have little understanding of what the results should be , @entity48 said			1
" yes , they can give the medication -- that 's not really hard , " she said			0
" but it is really difficult to teach someone how to assess how that medication is working , or how it 's not working			0
" anecdotally , @entity48 has heard about mistakes made by untrained staff : the child who got adhd medication twice from a busy principal ; the secretary who did n't know how to properly work an insulin pen and ended up giving none ; the child in @entity162 who died because no one knew to reach for her allergy autoinjector			0
she recommends that parents advocate for more school nurses in their district and check in with the staff that handles any health needs			1
" parents have a strong , powerful voice , and they want to make sure their child goes to school and comes home and in the interim is protected and safe			2

@entity3 has the highest student - to - school nurse ratio in the country , at 4,411 to 1
nurses are handling bigger caseloads as students ' medical needs become more complex
parents should ask who is in charge of their kid 's health while at school , *expert* says
