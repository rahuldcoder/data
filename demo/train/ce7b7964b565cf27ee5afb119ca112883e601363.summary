gov. @entity0 has a big decision to make come december : anger the governor of @entity3 , who holds significant power in the first - in - the - nation presidential primary contest , or anger basically everyone else			1
the @entity9 governor , who 's seriously mulling a bid for president , will have to decide whether to veto a bill that would ban the use of pig gestation crates , small metal containers that confine breeding sows for essentially their whole adult lives			1
critics consider the crates a form of animal cruelty -- the pigs are n't able to turn around in the limited space -- while advocates say they prevent sows from accidentally lying down or stepping on piglets			2
what are gestation crates ? despite having strong , bipartisan support in the state legislature , @entity0 vetoed a version of the bill in 2013			1
he 's now facing mounting pressure from activists and celebrities , including @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			2
the conservative news outlet @entity42 published a column by @entity44 , director of advocacy and policy for @entity47 , a national farm - animal protection organization , outlining a conservative case for @entity0 to ban the practice			1
but for @entity0 , the problem comes down to politics			0
while @entity9 's pork industry is n't very big and the ban would largely be symbolic , the pork industry is huge in @entity3			2
( there were 9,000 pigs in @entity9 last year , compared to 20.5 million in @entity3 , according to the @entity58			0
) gov. @entity59 , who recently won re-election in the @entity3 , told the @entity61 that he urged @entity0 to veto the bill last year			1
" i called him to tell him how bad i thought it would be and how the people that are involved in pork production , that really understand this , feel this would be very bad , " @entity59 said , reiterating the argument that the crates protect baby pigs from much larger adult pigs			0
@entity59 said they discussed the most recent version of the bill when @entity0 was in @entity3 last month for a fundraiser for @entity3 republicans			2
it 's unclear what @entity0 will do with the bill			0
last year , in his veto message , @entity0 said the decision should be made by the state 's @entity58			0
" the proper balancing of the humane treatment of gestating pigs with the interests of farmers whose livelihood depends on their ability to properly manage their livestock best rests with the state 's farming experts â € ” the @entity84 and the @entity58 , " he said			0
confronted about it at a town hall earlier this year , @entity0 said he felt that farmers had a better argument than animal rights activists			1
" if a bill comes back , i will certainly consider any additional evidence that people want to put in front of me , " he said .			0
