@entity2 authorities are failing to protect gay people from persecution and are not prosecuting the perpetrators of a growing number of homophobic attacks , @entity0 says in a new report			1
its report calls for a july 2013 anti-gay propaganda law to be repealed , saying many lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people interviewed for the report had noticed an increase in persecution since last year			1
the 2013 legislation bans " propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations around minors			1
" this means the public discussion of gay rights and relationships , anywhere children might hear it , is prohibited			0
@entity2 and international rights groups have condemned it as highly discriminatory			1
many of the @entity31 interviewees for the report released monday reported increased stigma , harassment and violence against them since 2013 , the rights group says			1
" the law effectively legalized discrimination against @entity31 people and cast them as second - class citizens , " it says			1
" instead of publicly denouncing @entity43 violence and rhetoric , @entity2 's leadership has remained silent			1
in some cases public officials have engaged in explicit @entity43 hate speech			2
" the report says that 22 of the 78 victims of homophobic and transphobic violence and harassment did not report attacks to police , as they did not think they would be taken seriously			1
law enforcement bodies can prosecute such violence under @entity2 's hate crime laws , @entity0 says , but not one of the cases documented in the report was investigated as a hate crime			1
the rights group describes anti-lgbt groups made up of " radical nationalist men " luring gay men and children on fake dates before holding them against their will and humiliating them			0
" in other cases , @entity31 people described being physically attacked by strangers on the subway , on the street , at nightclubs , and , in one case , at a job interview , " its report says			2
a transgender woman , referred to in the report as " @entity78 , " is quoted as saying she was abducted and brutally assaulted in @entity79 in 2013			2
" they kept calling me a ' faggot ' and telling me how much they hated gays			0
i told them repeatedly that i was n't gay , that i was a transgender woman , but they did not want to listen , " she says			0
" one of them said , ' you 're nothing but a faggot			0
we will get your brain straight right now			0
' several times they threatened to rape me			0
then they took pliers from their car and ripped out two of my toenails			0
afterwards , they said , ' now you will be better off			0
now you will be pretty			0
' " @entity0 says @entity78 explained that she had not gone to police because she had " no illusions that the police would investigate			2
" it quotes an @entity31 activist from @entity103 , @entity104 , as saying he had reported to police soon after he had been attacked			0
" his injuries were visible -- there was significant bruising on his forehead , there were bruises under his eyes , and one eye was swollen shut , " the report says			2
" the police officer who took his complaint said to him , ' it 's all right , you 're gay so it 's normal that you were attacked			2
why would you need to file a complaint against anyone ? ' " " violence experienced by @entity31 people in @entity2 is unmistakably motivated by homophobia , but the authorities deliberately ignore that these are hate crimes and fail to protect victims , " @entity0 's @entity125 said			1
the report includes responses from the @entity2 prosecutor @entity134 and @entity136 , and the rights group said neither agency collected statistical data about attacks specifically committed against @entity31 people			1
this month , president @entity142 met with @entity2 human rights groups , telling them that @entity2 's priority was " a healthy traditional family and a healthy nation			1
" he said that did not mean that it would persecute those " of a nontraditional orientation			0
" " people have tried to stick this label on us , even people who use criminal law to persecute people of nontraditional orientation			2
some @entity160 states make it a crime , and though as far as i know these laws are not actually applied and the @entity165 has suspended them , but they are nevertheless still on the books			0
we have no criminal penalties , " he said			0
@entity142 said that no one should face discrimination in @entity2			1
" all people here have political rights , social rights , rights to employment , and no one should face discrimination , " he said			1
" but our strategic choice is for traditional families , healthy families and a healthy nation			1
one does not exclude the other and does not hinder the other			0
i think this is a balanced approach and is entirely the right approach			0

a @entity0 report says @entity2 has failed to *prevent* homophobic violence
it blames a growing number of attacks on a 2013 anti-gay propaganda law
authorities are failing to use hate crime legislation to prosecute *offenders* , the report says
@entity2 's president has said no one should face discrimination , calls " traditional families " priority
