-- " @entity3 " knows within a split second if something is awry			1
the trouble is , he only has two further seconds to put it right			2
such are the fine margins in @entity10 's chosen discipline , cliff diving -- which he lovingly , and understatedly , refers to as " fun " and " intense			1
" the @entity14 is a master of his art , with 11 world high - diving titles and two @entity21 world records to his name , including one for a " perfect 10 " dive at the @entity24 in 2000			1
he had started out in conventional @entity27 - style diving , but after growing tired of the pool he turned to the cliffs and an adrenaline - fueled pursuit that can thrill and terrify in equal measure			1
" when i jump off , immediately i know if things are going well or not , " the 39 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity34 series			2
" i know if i 'm having a problem or something or if i just need to go through the dive and things should be ok			2
" you get information immediately and it 's amazing how fast you start processing that and , if needed , trying to make adjustments -- because you can make adjustments in mid-air , but it is just really quick			2
as soon as you jump off , you know if it is ok , we 're good			2
" @entity10 is a permanent fixture on the @entity53 circuit , which this year consists of eight events in glamorous destinations such as @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
participants perform four dives from a 27 - meter cliff -- two stipulated , two freestyle -- often reaching speeds of 85 kph with every fall			1
every leap is a leap into the unknown ; a crash landing from 27m is the equivalent of a 13m fall onto concrete			2
but ask @entity10 for a comparison and he offers an unlikely one			1
" when i dive off a cliff , it 's too much fun			1
i have all the control , i decide to jump and the feeling in the air , it 's just amazing , " he says			2
" it 's kind of like how your dog feels when he sticks his head out of the window , he 's just so happy feeling the wind			2
that 's how we feel			2
" when i 'm standing up on top , i 'm worried			2
i know this is high			1
it 's going to be some danger involved in the dive but i still want to do it			2
" and you 're worried , you have a little bit of fear but then when you 're in the air , you feel the wind in your face			0
it 's really , really intense and then once you 're in the water , it 's like ' @entity103 '			0
" in three seconds you went from being really worried and now you 're in the water and you 're super happy			0
it just changes really quickly and it 's hard to compare to anything else , you know ? " @entity10 swapped the football pitch for the pool aged just nine and has never looked back			1
he made the switch to cliff diving in 1995 and was soon the sport 's dominant force			1
his first cliff diving world title came in 2000 , the season in which he broke a world record after scoring a perfect 10 from all seven judges for a double back somersault with four twists from 24.4m in @entity124			1
he went on to win an incredible nine world titles , the last coming in 2009 , the first year of @entity53 's sponsorship			1
agonizingly , he lost out to @entity128 rival @entity127 last year in the very final round of competition			1
but he did get his own back on an emotional return to the pool in july , winning gold as high diving made its debut at the 2013 @entity24 in @entity136 , alongside more established disciplines such as swimming , synchro and water polo			1
it was fitting reward for a pioneer of the sport who has had much to do with its slipstream into the mainstream -- and one which ranks as his proudest achievement			0
" it was the first time our sport was there , so being part of that group that was probably the top there , " he says			0
" and winning my first cliff diving world championships back in 2000			1
it was a great competition			1
it was of course the first one			0
that stays in your mind , for sure			0
" easing back into the pool environment -- where in @entity27 diving competitors leap from heights between 1 - 10 meters -- is a much easier transition than the move in the other direction			1
so apart from the obvious , what takes the most adapting to ? " if you 're going higher than 25 meters the speed is much higher so you have to get used to that first , and the height and the speed of the fall , " @entity10 says			1
" you can not train that too much because the impact of the water is so heavy , the body can not handle it			0
you have to really trust yourself , trust your skills			0
know that you 're going to be able to do it			0
" @entity10 can still recall the first time he dipped his toe in the cliff diving water , in @entity190			1
" it was scary , " he explains			0
" and it 's because you do n't have that much proper training let 's say up until that point			0
you kind of have to take the leap			0
you go up and then you know you can control certain dives and then you 've just got to do it			0
" luckily , i had really good technique , really good preparation			0
it was in @entity190 in this little river thing and beautiful place but in those moments when you 're like scared , you do n't even realize what 's around you			0
" you forget all of that and you just focus on the dive			0
it was really nice but i can only remember the dive , let 's say			0
" @entity10 is currently third in the standings with just one event remaining this season -- inclement weather dealt his championship hopes a blow by forcing the abandonment of the penultimate event in @entity56			1
it did , however , save @entity10 's body the strain of another competition and he admits that even textbook dives tend to hurt in some way shape or form			1
" doing some of the things i 've done , i 've scared myself a few times but it 's more of a natural thing , " he says			0
" it 's just my defense mechanism telling me , ' listen , be careful ' , you know ? you have to be concentrated to do this			0
" i 'm fully conscious of what i 'm doing and i know i can do it , it 's just you have that automatic switch in your head that is telling you be careful , you 're not supposed to do this			0
" if you make a mistake then deceleration is too quick -- you can have a concussion , you can have a broken coccyx the legs can separate and then you overstretch , separated pelvises -- that 's common injury			0
" it could be that you have some internal bleeding if you were to land completely flat			0
" @entity10 has seen the sport grow in his near 20 - year cliff diving career , and after recognition by @entity24 at the @entity24 , there is one more leap for it to make			1
" i 've been around this for over 15 years and every year is getting better in terms of diving , also the sport is growing , " he says			2
" we 've just been included in @entity24 ( which governs most water sports )			1
hopefully in the future , it will make it to the @entity27			0
you know , this is a spectacular sport that would add to the @entity27			0

@entity10 has won nine cliff diving world championships and two world records
cliff divers can reach speeds of 85 kph when jumping from 27 meter high *platforms*
known as " @entity3 , " he also won the first high diving gold at @entity24
he recorded a perfect 10 score during a cliff diving competition in @entity124 in 2000
