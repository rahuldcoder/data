-- a day after sunday 's 35 - minute power outage during the @entity4 game in @entity5 , officials were vowing to fix whatever the cause may have been , but no one was saying just what that was			1
" we 're going to work very closely with @entity14 to get to the root of the problem , " said @entity10 , president of @entity11 , referring to the company that manages the dome			1
" we both made excellent preparations for an event like this , and then the system worked the way it was supposed to work			2
" " we 've spent millions of dollars upgrading our equipment , including our electrical feeders , and we 've never had this issue before , " said @entity22 , an @entity14 executive who was in @entity24 control at the time of the incident			1
the interruption in service occurred in a substation that supplies the stadium with power , he said			2
a piece of equipment in the substation " detected some abnormalities and it did what it was supposed to do -- it opened a switch , basically a breaker , which shunted the power that we were receiving from @entity11 and de-energized the building			1
" he noted that electricians and electrical consultants were on site and pitched in immediately			2
a fire alarm that was hit prior to halftime appears to have had nothing to do with the outage , nor did the halftime show , @entity22 said			2
the halftime presentation was run on generated power , " which means it was not on our power grid at all , " he said			2
any electrical issues identified in the probe will be addressed , he promised			2
" these are fixable problems , " he said			1
" obviously , for me , it 's a disappointing moment , but when you 're relying on systems , it 's not a human error , it 's an equipment error			1
we 'll get to the root cause of it and we 'll find out what it is			2
" @entity24 executive vice president @entity71 praised the fans for remaining calm			2
" they acted with the belief that the game was going to come back on , just as you or i would have acted in their seats , and that 's what you and i did			1
" though the investigation has just begun , " there is no indication at all that this was caused by the halftime show , absolutely none , " said @entity24 commissioner @entity82 , referring to @entity84 's power - packed performance			1
" that is not the case from anything we have at this point			0
" the company completed upgrades to the stadium 's electrical equipment on december 21 , but that may have had nothing to do with sunday night 's problem , said @entity11 spokesman @entity102			1
" since then , we 've had three major events -- the @entity104 , the @entity107 - @entity106 game and the @entity108 -- " with no issues			0
" on monday , @entity110 aired video shot from inside a stadium control room as the outage occurred			1
" all right , we lost lights , " says a man as the room darkened			1
moments later , a man says , " @entity117 , we lost the @entity119 feed			0
" " what does that mean ? " he is asked			0
" it means that we have to do the bus tie			0
" " what does that mean ? " " it means about a 20 - minute delay			0
" the ceo and director of research for @entity132 , a market intelligence and analysis firm for the utility and smart grid industry , said someone appears to have made a mistake in their estimate of how much energy the building 's electrical infrastructure could handle			1
" someone made that decision not to invest , saying , ' we can handle this , ' " said @entity144			0
" come to find out that their load was just much higher than anticipated			0
" he continued , " you can say it 's the electrical infrastructure but , at the end of the day , there 's a human component to it , a decision that had to be made			1
" but @entity159 , a sports facility consultant , was not persuaded anyone was to blame			0
" i would be very reluctant to ever point a finger , knowing what i know now , at an individual ; i just think it was one of those things , " he said			0
" i 've got to believe that those guys do the preventive maintenance			0
" besides , @entity159 said , the outage was no more than an inconvenience			0
" nobody got hurt ; everybody was safe			0
" and @entity172 , vice president for energy delivery at the @entity174 , said the system appears to have worked well , given that the lights came back on and the circuitry was not damaged			0
" the bottom line for any utility or any electric planner would be -- protect your equipment so that you can re-energize it			1
and it appears to be exactly what happened			0
" @entity110 , citing ratings figures from @entity186 , said sunday 's game between the 49ers and the @entity189 reached a total of 164.1 million viewers , making it the most - viewed show in @entity194 history			1
figures were tallied from 6:32 p.m. et until 8:41 p.m. et and from 9:11 p.m. until 10:47 p.m. the average number of viewers was put at 108.4 million , which ranked it third .			0

" these are fixable problems , " says management exec
" it 's not a human error , it 's an equipment error , " he adds
video from inside a control room shows the incident unfolding
" we do *n't* have a *lot* of details to share , " an @entity11 spokesman says
