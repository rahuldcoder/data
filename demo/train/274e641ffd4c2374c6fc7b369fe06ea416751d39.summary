-- we 'll have to wait a couple more months , safely after the election , to see @entity5 's film about the hunt for @entity7 , " @entity8			1
" but in the meantime , director and star @entity11 and screenwriter @entity12 have found a positive spin on one of the least auspicious episodes in @entity17 foreign policy , the @entity19 hostage drama that probably doomed @entity21 's bid for a second term in 1980			1
the movie quickly and smartly fills in the back story , reminding us how @entity26 powers propped up the monarchy in @entity19 until the @entity29 revolution of 1979 , a popular uprising that gave vent to anti-american fury in the region			1
fifty - two @entity17 citizens were captured in the @entity34 in @entity35 -- but six escaped undetected in the melee and found refuge in the home of the @entity40 ambassador			1
the challenge then for the @entity42 : how to get them out from under the noses of the ayatollahs			1
enter @entity46 ( @entity11 ) , an " exfiltration " specialist ( who knew ? ) who does n't think much of the @entity50 's plan to send in bikes and road maps			1
challenged to come up with something better , he concocts an improbable scheme about a phony movie : posing as a @entity57 producer , he 'll connect with the six under the guise of scouting locations			2
it 's far - fetched , but that 's the beauty of it			0
who would make up something like that ? anyway it 's the best bad idea they 've got			0
artfully recreating the look and feel of ' 70s suspense films by accentuating the grain and resisting the impulse to blow stuff up every 10 minutes , @entity11 has crafted a compelling middlebrow thriller that probably would n't have stood out from the crowd in that period , but which is easily one of the must - sees in 2012 -- a shoo - in for @entity79 consideration			1
it 's a well - paced and gripping entertainment certainly , even if you might roll your eyes at the contrived race - against - the - clock climax			0
more unexpectedly , and winningly , @entity11 opens up a second front , a very droll insider satire on @entity57 hubris when @entity46 enlists a makeup artist and producer to beef up his cover story			1
@entity91 and @entity92 work up a delicious comic double act , daintily skewering the rampant egomania of the movie business as well as its endless capacity for self - denial			0
" if i 'm doing a fake movie , it 's going to be a fake hit ! " declares @entity92 's @entity98 before reluctantly lending his name to a bottom - drawer sci - fi adventure script -- " @entity104 " -- which calls for a vaguely @entity106 cosmos			1
it 's the very opposite kind of movie to the one @entity11 makes			2
there 's nothing showy or spectacular about his filmmaking			0
he puts the emphasis squarely on story and situation			0
he may not probe his characters very deeply , but they 're believable victims of dire circumstance			0
he also casts very well : @entity120 as @entity46 's @entity42 boss , @entity121 as the @entity40 ambassador , @entity122 as the most skeptical and reluctant of the hostages			2
they 're all absolutely on point			0
@entity11 himself turns in a quietly impressive movie star performance			2
@entity46 is a kind of @entity129 , comfortable with his anonymity , living off his wits , not his fists			0
smart , courageous and modest -- that 's a rare combination in a man , and in movies , too .			0

@entity11 has crafted a compelling middlebrow thriller -- easily a must - see film
" @entity104 " shows how @entity26 powers propped up the monarchy in @entity19 until 1979
@entity11 plays @entity42 " exfiltration " specialist who concocts unlikely plan to rescue six @entity17
