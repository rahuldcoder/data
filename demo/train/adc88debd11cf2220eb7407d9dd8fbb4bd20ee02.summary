-- college admissions are competitive , and not just from the student 's side			0
sure , sometimes it 's hard to get into the college of your choice , but the schools are fighting just as hard to lure in top applicants			2
@entity11 college students do n't have to visit laundromats because they enjoy the luxury of a free laundry service			1
while some colleges boast about class sizes , graduate fellowships , and endowment growth rates , this sort of info is likely to bore the 17 - year - old students they 're wooing			1
instead , some schools try to come up with unique perks that appeal to students , often in the form of free services			1
while the cost of these " free " perks is undoubtedly built back into tuition bills , when a family 's spending upwards of $ 40,000 a year for school , it ca n't hurt to help them feel like they 're getting something for nothing			1
here are a few you might be jealous of : 1			0
free laundry nothing 's more maddening for a college student than wanting to study , party , or sleep , only to be confronted with a massive mound of laundry			1
most of us know that if left unchecked , these piles of dirty clothes can grow until they 're on the brink of becoming sentient beings , but students at @entity11 , an elite liberal arts college in @entity54 , do n't have to worry about it			1
their college does the laundry for them			2
since 1919 , @entity11 has been operating a laundry facility that allows students to drop off their laundry and pick it up once its clean and smelling of dryer sheets			1
at the @entity66 , students ' dress shirts and blouses are even pressed and put on hangers for them			2
the laundry clears about six tons ' worth of dirty clothes and linens a week , but if students prefer to keep their filthy t - shirts to themselves , the school also offers free self - service washers and dryers in the dorms			1
as if that 's not enough , @entity11 was even more generous when its basketball team made a miraculous run to the @entity83 's @entity82 last march			1
the school shelled out the cash for free bus transport to the venue in @entity88 , two nights ' lodging , and a free ticket to the game for any student who wanted to go cheer on their @entity94 in person			2
@entity97 - free colleges 2			2
free skiing @entity99 offers a pretty standard slate of majors for its students , but it also has a real estate holding that might lure in applicants			1
the school owns @entity106 , a ski slope on the @entity108			0
while normal lift - ticket prices run at around $ 35 a day , @entity99 students can hit the slopes without dropping a dime			2
free computers at my undergrad alma mater , @entity114 , one of the chief perks is that when you showed up for freshman orientation , the school gives you a fully loaded @entity122 and a printer			1
students keep this laptop for two years , then trade it in for a new model before their junior year			2
students then take this one with them when they graduate			0
while there was a downside to the system ( if profs know everyone has a laptop , they 're not the least bit shy about making you tote it to class ) , it really upped the on - campus computing efficiency			0
any program you needed for a class was already loaded on the laptop , and since everyone on campus was operating one of only two types of machines , tech support could diagnose problems and fix them really quickly			0
@entity97 : 12 college classes we wish our schools offered 4			0
free theater tickets nothing irks actors and theater owners quite so much as playing to an empty house , so if tickets are moving slowly , why not fill the seats with college students ? @entity165 's @entity164 can wrangle @entity167 and @entity168 tickets for up to 75 percent off their face values , but sometimes , the school can get lucky students into theaters for free to help fill otherwise thin crowds			1
@entity164 also boasts that it can get students into @entity177 games for as little as $ 12 and into @entity179 games for just $ 3			0
of course , the way those teams have played in the last year or so , that offer might scare off more prospective students than it entices			0
personalized birthday cakes college birthdays are often all sorts of debauched fun , but at least in my experience , they were often sorely lacking in quality cake			1
sure , sometimes you 'd get a pan full of @entity194 - ed good intentions cooked in a dorm oven , which are precisely calibrated to burn cakes ' edges while leaving the center liquid , but it was rare to see a real birthday cake			2
@entity202 's dining services can fix that , though , by allowing students ' parents to join the @entity206			1
for $ 18 , parents can make sure their kid gets a personalize birthday cake and all of the plates , napkins , and forks they 'll need to share it with their friends			0
cheap golf college students who want to golf on a tight budget often have to resign themselves to finding the rattiest municipal course they can find and hoping they survive the ordeal			0
students at @entity220 , though , have access to the @entity222 , a legendary course that 's hosted such greats as @entity225 and @entity226 since it opened in 1930			0
only students , alumni , faculty , and their guests can enjoy the course 's picturesque views of @entity233 , and for guests the price is pretty steep , up to $ 110 a round			0
students , though , get a great deal on greens fees ; they can get in a full round for just $ 25			0
