@entity0 -- video showing @entity3			1
@entity4 , captured by the @entity5 in @entity6 , is just another example of how captors use the medium for psychological warfare			1
@entity12 spc. @entity11 , who was held by insurgents in @entity14 , prepares to enter a plane to safety			1
the latest video shows @entity4 , of @entity18 , @entity19 , looking comfortable and eating food			1
while he expresses concern about not seeing his family and girlfriend again , he does appear to speak calmly and has no visible signs of abuse			2
" i have a very , very good family that i love back home in @entity30 , and i miss them every day that i 'm gone , " he says in a 28 - minute video released by his captors			1
" i miss them , and i 'm afraid i might never see them again and that i 'll never be able to tell them i love them again			2
i 'll never be able to hug them			2
" but that is in stark contrast to the well - publicized captures of @entity30 servicemen and women in conflicts past			2
@entity43 sen. @entity44 , whose plane was shot down during a combat mission over @entity43 in 1967 , is considered one of the most famous prisoners of war			1
he was captured by the communist @entity49 and spent nearly six years in a prisoner of war camp , where he was often tortured			1
a grainy black - and - white film released by his captors showed a severely injured @entity44 talking on camera in the so - called " @entity56			1
" @entity44 later refused to be released before other prisoners			1
he eventually returned to the @entity30 in 1973			0
" during the years , we were kept in solitary confinement or two or three to a cell because they did n't want us to see each other			0
we 'd spend all our time tapping on the walls to each other and encouraging each other and organizing , organizing , organizing with our chain of command			0
the days and hours go by , " @entity44 told @entity1 's @entity68 last year			1
@entity14 and most recently , in 2003 , video from @entity14 painted a picture of an unruly and chaotic terror organization holding @entity30 soldiers captured in the @entity14 military theater			1
army spc. @entity11 was shown on videotape being interrogated -- with five other soldiers including @entity3			1
@entity76 , who was badly wounded and was held prisoner at a separate location			0
nine of their fellow soldiers were killed when their convoy was ambushed			1
@entity11 appeared frightened , with her eyes darting quickly left and right			0
i did n't know what was going to happen to me , " @entity11 said in a past @entity1 interview			0
" and i was in a lot of pain			0
" @entity76 's videotaped rescue made her a celebrity , and she was used by the @entity90 to put a face on the men and women who were fighting the war against the regime of @entity96			2
@entity11 and the other @entity97 spent 22 days as prisoners until @entity99 rescued them			2
@entity100 , a former lead international kidnapping coordinator for the @entity101 , says that as a lesson from the @entity11 video , the @entity5 may have learned to try to appear more political than radical			2
" they 're hoping that ... this gets to other media outlets that will make them appear so that they are a reasonable political force , " he says			0
" there is very much a lack of overthreat in the [ @entity4 ] video , and they clearly thought this through ... specifically strategic for these purposes			1
" @entity117 army chief warrant officer 3 @entity118 , a @entity119 helicopter pilot , was shot down in 1993 during a combat mission in @entity121 , @entity117			0
the body of one of his fellow pilots being dragged through the streets was captured on video			1
after the crash , he was captured by a mob and held for 11 days			2
@entity118 suffered several serious injuries , including a broken back and face and leg wounds			0
his bloodied and bruised face was splashed on the covers of several national magazines , including @entity136 and @entity137 , and on tv networks			0
his story later inspired @entity141 's bestseller " @entity144 " and a movie by director @entity143			0
@entity100 says his image was depicted in a different way than others had been			0
" the media picked that up and ran in a way that was very accusatory towards the @entity30 , " he says			0
" there were pictures of @entity118 in a clearly beaten - up condition , and the captions in the various national magazines were , ' what in the world are we doing ? ' " @entity100 says that from that incident , the @entity30 may have learned to apply the mostly mum stance it 's using during the @entity4 capture			1
" the @entity30 government gave a knee - jerk reaction to that , which i think they 've learned from , " he says			0
" so how this plays out in the media , the @entity5 is being very cautious to appear to be reasonable ... because they do n't want to make themselves look like they 're fanatical			0
they are trying to be very reasonable			0
