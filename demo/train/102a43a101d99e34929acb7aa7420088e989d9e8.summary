@entity0 , @entity1 -- can jumping spiders still hunt for their prey in space ? it may sound like science fiction or the start of a bad joke , but this is an experiment that will be carried out on the @entity13 later this year , thanks to @entity1 teenager @entity15			1
@entity15 , 19 , from @entity0 , came up with one of the two winning entries from around the world for the @entity20 competition , backed by professor @entity21 , which asked students to design experiments for space scientists			1
the idea behind @entity15 's experiment is to study how the zebra spider , which jumps on its prey rather than building a web , will hunt when it is in zero gravity			1
it was conceived through @entity15 's fascination with both science and spiders			1
" i 'm just interested in how things work , and science seems to answer all my questions , " said @entity15			1
" for example , physics can explain the world with just a handful of equations			0
and biology tells you how your body works			0
i 'm just interested in that stuff			0
" @entity15 only heard about the @entity20 competition three days before the deadline , so he designed and made a @entity20 video of his idea in a single day			1
he said he was reading about which animals had been in space , and discovered orb weaver spiders among them			1
" they were very interesting because they build the knots differently , " said @entity15			1
" so i say , ok , they can survive , let 's make things a little harder			0
let 's get a kind of spider that ca n't build webs in space and that actually gravity is a factor in the way it hunts , so that 's how the idea came			2
" i just started writing a script and turned the camera on and explained my experiment and edited the video and it was online before the day was over			0
" @entity15 was announced as a regional finalist and after a week of public voting was invited to @entity81 as a regional winner to experience a zero - gravity flight			2
also on inside the @entity84 : the film director who 's not allowed to go to the movies during the trip , @entity15 and a two - girl team from @entity88 , @entity89 , were announced as global winners whose experiments will be taken to the @entity13			1
@entity15 is currently taking a gap year before studying at @entity94 , @entity95 , in the fall			1
he said : " before the competition , i was just a kid struggling with my a-levels			0
out of the huge ocean of the internet , the tide brought me @entity101 so right now , i know where i want to be			0
i know who i want to be			0
" @entity15 's achievement is particularly impressive as @entity1 's math and science education came 125th out of 139 nations in a @entity109 survey			1
" there 's not many @entity1 in the field of science and technology , " said @entity15			1
" @entity1 is not at the front of innovation			2
when it comes to technology or science , we 're always consumers , we 're never producers			0
" @entity15 's education was disrupted during last year 's revolution , when his school was closed for several months			1
" there was so much stress and nobody knew where this was going , " he said			0
" we had to protect the streets , so we formed committees to protect the streets			0
" i had a curriculum to study , and we did n't know when the revolution was going to end or when this is going to stop , or when the school is going to get back			2
so we had to go on			0
i had to study and do the patrolling and and from time to time join the protests			0
" also on inside the @entity84 : @entity84 women beat men in education @entity15 hopes one day to help change @entity1 attitudes to science through his passion			1
" if i 'm going to work in the field of science or technology , i might be able to bring the cultural or regional problems that people of the @entity84 have into the field for tackling to solve them , " said @entity15			2
@entity15 's mother , @entity150 , saw his potential early			1
" each person rises in a certain field , but for @entity15 it was reading all along			2
he read a lot and in everything			0
he was reading books at age three , " she said			0
she , too , hopes that after her son has studied abroad , he will return to @entity1 to create a better future			2
" to benefit his country and maybe start a project like many others who came back and developed @entity1 to benefit their own people , " she said			2

@entity1 @entity15 designed an experiment for the @entity20 competition
his experiment to send jumping spiders into space will be carried out on the @entity13
