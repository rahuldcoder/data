-- over 28,000 @entity2 fans marked the 20th anniversary of the @entity5 disaster in a special memorial service at @entity7 on wednesday			1
@entity2 supporters at the @entity10 end paid their respects in an emotional afternoon at @entity7			1
a total of 96 supporters died on april 15 , 1989 before the @entity15 semifinal between @entity2 and @entity16 at @entity18 's stadium , the worst - ever tragedy in @entity21 sporting history			1
to commemorate the anniversary , the city of @entity2 came to a standstill at 3.06 pm ( 1406 gmt ) with the bells of the two cathedrals and its civic buildings ringing out in memory of those fans who lost their lives			1
on @entity7 's famous @entity10 , 96 candles were lit while commemorations took place at @entity5 and also in @entity34			1
members of the current @entity2 team stood somberly as hymns were played before a roll call of the dead was read out			2
club legend @entity40 , who was @entity2 manager at the time of the disaster , then read a short prayer			2
the mayor of @entity2 , @entity45 , who was at the game 20 years ago , helped organize the emotional memorial			1
" @entity5 affected so many lives , not just on @entity49 but across the whole of the @entity51 , " he said			2
" i attended the match 20 years ago and the passing years do not diminish the importance and the poignancy of this occasion			0
" @entity2 captain @entity56 , whose 10 - year - old cousin @entity57 was the youngest victim of the tragedy , spoke of his feelings this week			1
" @entity60 has gone by , but the scars will never ever be healed and the fans will never ever forget			0
so you can always rely on our supporters to be there for you when you need them			0
" the @entity2 fans died in a crush which started just before the kick - off as the gate at the @entity71 was opened with terrible consequences			1
the match started but when the scale of the tragedy became clear , it was swiftly abandoned at 3.06 pm			0
in the immediate aftermath , the @entity51 government commissioned @entity78 to conduct an inquiry which would have a far - reaching impact on football			2
@entity78 was deeply critical of the police operation at @entity5 , but his most significant recommendations were the removal of perimeter fencing and the creation of all - seater stadia			1
his report also cleared @entity2 fans of blame for the tragedy after lurid tabloid headlines provoked revulsion on @entity49			1
prime minister @entity94 paid reference to the controversy in an interview released on @entity2 's official television channel			0
" it was wrong for people to blame , as some did , @entity2 fans on that day , " he said			0
" that 's probably what matters most -- that people understood that the behavior of @entity2 fans in helping each other was magnificent			0
" let 's never forget the fans who cruelly lost their lives on a day when we know the people of @entity2 were trying to help each other , " he added			0
however , the people of @entity2 are still angry and bitter at the lack of justice for those who died -- and that frustration surfaced when @entity116 , the @entity117 took to the stand to address the crowd			2
as @entity116 spoke , the crowd rose as one to sing " @entity5 "			0
the @entity10 chant boomed around the stadium and @entity116 , an @entity123 fan , was left in no doubt about the strength of feeling over the lack of accountability from officialdom over the tragedy			0
fittingly , the ceremony was concluded with @entity132 leading the fans in singing @entity2 anthem ' @entity135 ' .			0
