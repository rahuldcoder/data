-- the @entity1 recently reported that @entity3 's former political advisers are adamantly denying rumors that their boss might run for the presidency in 2016			1
" i take @entity3 at his absolute word , " said @entity7			1
" he 's not running			2
" whether or not @entity3 wants to run , or if his family is comfortable with his doing so , will be up to them			1
but should he decide to put his hat in the ring , it 's not crazy to think that @entity3 would be able to end up at the top of the @entity16 ticket in 2016			1
most pundits believed that his political career had come to an end following his loss to president @entity21 in 2012			2
but a sympathetic portrayal in a @entity24 documentary , entitled " @entity3 , " combined with his fund - raising for midterm candidates in the 2014 elections , has generated considerable buzz			1
the odds are obviously not great			2
republicans would naturally be jittery about selecting a candidate who could n't make it through the primaries in 2008 and then crashed and burned against @entity21			0
while many @entity16 were sure that @entity21 should be a one - term president -- another @entity21 , in their minds -- the @entity34 devastated @entity3 as a candidate who only cared about the rich and who had no inner core			1
so how could someone recover from this kind of loss ? how could @entity3 end up as the next @entity16 nominee ? if he were interested in running , @entity3 could take some comfort from the fact that some political losers have been able to rebuild themselves			1
@entity48 seemed like he would vanish into political thin air after losing to @entity50 in the 1960 presidential election and then losing to @entity52 in the @entity54 gubernatorial election in 1962			0
" you wo n't have @entity48 to kick around anymore , " he said after losing			0
that turned out to be incorrect , not because @entity48 vanished from politics but because he came back stronger than ever in 1968			0
after building his reputation as a statesman and playing a key role in helping republicans in the 1966 midterm campaign , @entity48 defeated @entity63 to become president in 1968			0
@entity67 , after coming close to defeating president @entity65 in the 1976 @entity16 primaries , spent the next four years expanding his audience and refining his message through his weekly radio shows			2
he became the front - runner in 1980 and beat @entity21 to become president			0
like @entity48 in 1966 , @entity3 has been proving his worth on the campaign trail in 2014			2
he is the " man in demand			0
" @entity3 " is the most prominent and engaged elder statesman the @entity16 has on the national stage right now , " one @entity16 consultant told @entity0 , watching how the former presidential candidate has been a star at fund - raising events			1
while a number of figures in the @entity16 are clearly preparing to jump into the presidential race , each of them is flawed			1
sen. @entity86 of @entity87 espouses a kind of libertarianism that does n't sit well with most of the party			0
@entity92 gov. @entity91 might rebuild his career , but " bridgegate " has greatly tarnished his reputation			0
@entity97 @entity16 @entity96 has a scandal of his own			2
sen. @entity100 of @entity101 is untested on the national stage and will try to run as the " immigrant " candidate in a party that has stood by a very hardline position on immigration			0
former @entity101 gov. @entity108 has to contend with the @entity108 name in an electorate that still harbors negative feelings about his brother 's time in the @entity115			0
rep. @entity116 of @entity97 , who is becoming the most plausible candidate , is too closely associated with the right wing of his party and comes from a caucus of @entity121 who rank incredibly low in the polls			0
despite all the animosity that emerged toward @entity3 's wealth and his record on economic issues , the fact is that @entity3 's preference for strong deregulatory and regressive policies fits very comfortably with the major thrust of the party			1
since @entity67 's presidency in the 1980s , the heart of @entity16 policies has not been about social and cultural issues , but rather about aiming to weaken the regulatory arm of the government over the economy			1
on these issues , @entity3 has impeccable credentials			1
as a result , @entity3 will still hold considerable appeal among major donors and conservative activists , like the @entity147 brothers , as the candidate who will aggressively pursue their core agenda			2
the money and endorsements can go a long way			0
it is not that difficult to see how the nation might witness a presidential campaign in 2016 that includes @entity3			1
whether he would be able to take on @entity156 or some of the other potential @entity34 nominees remains unclear			0
but speculation that he might end up as the person the @entity16 turns to is not that out of the bounds of reason .			1

@entity3 's former advisers are denying rumors that he might run for presidency in 2016
@entity167 : if @entity3 does decide to run , he may end up at the top of the @entity16 ticket
he says each of the *current* presidential contenders in the @entity16 is flawed
@entity167 : @entity3 's stance on issues appeals to @entity16 , and he 's great at fund - raising
