-- the headline screaming from the front page of wednesday 's @entity3 said it all : " @entity5 : @entity6			1
" above the text , @entity7 -- the mayor of @entity9 -- beamed out at readers from the news conference where he had just admitted smoking crack cocaine			1
" probably , approximately about a year ago			2
" despite the controversy , @entity7 is clinging to office , confounding critics and delighting supporters who say he 's done plenty of good for the city -- despite headlines around the world that have splashed a bit of mud on the image of the gleaming lakeside city that 's arguably the cultural center of @entity30 - speaking @entity29			2
we all make mistakes , " one resident told @entity29 broadcaster @entity33			2
" if he smokes and saves me money , i 'll vote for him â € ” even if he 's a bum , " said another			2
in fact , some polling data suggested @entity7 's approval ratings had actually climbed in the days before his stunning announcement tuesday after months of denials -- as they had in september with the scandal in full swing			1
at that time , some 10,000 cheering supporters packed the @entity7 family 's annual barbecue -- even with all the lurid accusations of drug use and purported links to street criminals , @entity33 reported			2
" he 's a remarkable individual and a lot of people have put their faith in him , " city councillor @entity55 told @entity0 's @entity57 on tuesday			0
" the question is when will the public feel that he 's basically taking advantage of them and that he has abused that trust that they 've given him			0
" tuesday 's admission followed months of sometimes heated denials prompted by reports this spring by the @entity72 website @entity73 and the @entity3 newspaper revealing the existence of a video that purportedly shows @entity5 smoking crack			1
the scandal widened amid a police investigation and the arrest of one of @entity5 's friends on drug charges			1
he denied the allegations -- until tuesday -- when he emerged from his office and shocked reporters with his sudden admission			1
" yes , i have smoked crack cocaine			1
but no , do i ? am i an addict ? no , " he said			0
" have i tried it ? probably in one of my drunken stupors , probably approximately about a year ago			0
" he has not been charged with any wrongdoing			1
" i actually was completely surprised , " said @entity95 , city hall reporter for the @entity96			0
reporters had expected him to resign , she said			0
@entity9 mayor wo n't resign the admission was the only the latest oddity in what @entity102 called " the weirdest mayoralty ever			1
" among other things , @entity7 has been called out for comments some have interpreted as racist , homophobic and misogynistic , and he has had several brushes with city ethics regulators , according to the @entity96			0
but he has also scored successes , including fiscal reforms that have endeared him to supporters , columnist @entity110 wrote in @entity102			0
" while the entire city has been distracted by the giant blowhard on the screen , the man behind the curtain has accomplished some impressive wizardry , " he said			0
for some , the drama surrounding @entity7 echoes that of @entity121 , who was mayor of @entity122 when a police sting operation captured him smoking crack with an informant in 1990			1
after a spectacular fall from grace and six months in prison , @entity121 successfully ran for a seat on the @entity130 under the slogan , " he may not be perfect , but he 's perfect for @entity122 " he then ran for mayor again in 1994 and served a four - year term before returning in 2002 to the @entity130 , where he remains			1
a common tie between the men : a penchant for controversial quotes and an unquestioned love of their communities			1
" he loves the city and wants to represent the city as mayor , " city councillor @entity142 said wednesday , speaking of @entity7			2
can he ? @entity146 says she thinks so			0
there 's no impeachment law or recall process to force him from office , she says			0
but @entity142 says that despite continued support among his base , it 's time for @entity7 to step aside -- at least temporarily -- and deal with his personal issues			2
" it does n't really reflect well on the city and the residents , many of the residents , most of the residents are fed up and they would like to see him resign , " she said wednesday			0
@entity5 , however , seems to have other things on his mind , @entity95 said			1
" as far as he 's concerned , the election for 2014 's started , " she said			0
addicts shoot up in safe haven in @entity29			0
