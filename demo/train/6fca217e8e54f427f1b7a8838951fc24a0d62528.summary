-- a @entity3 man pleaded guilty thursday in connection with a plot to bomb a military recruiting station in retaliation for @entity9 forces killing @entity10 overseas , authorities said			1
@entity12 , 22 , a @entity10 convert who also goes by the name @entity15 , pleaded guilty to use of a weapon of mass destruction against federal property in connection with the plot involving an @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , the @entity11 said			1
the guilty plea was part of a plea agreement with prosecutors , authorities said			2
if the court accepts the plea , @entity12 will be sentenced to 25 years in prison			1
sentencing is set for april 6			2
@entity12 was arrested in december 2010 after attempting to detonate an inert device supplied to him by an undercover @entity36 agent , authorities said			1
according to the plea agreement , @entity12 first raised the subject of attacking military targets with an @entity36 confidential source in october 2010			1
during recorded conversations that followed with the source and later an undercover @entity36 agent , @entity12 identified the recruiting station as a target and " spoke about his anger toward @entity9 , his belief that @entity10 were being unjustly targeted and killed by the @entity9 military , and his desire to commit jihad to send a message that @entity9 soldiers would be killed unless the country stopped its ' war ' against @entity57 , " federal prosecutors said			1
he also articulated his beliefs in postings on his @entity61 page and in two @entity61 chats with the source , the @entity11 said			0
he attempted to recruit people to join in the plot , authorities said			2
all of them declined , and one attempted to dissuade him from it			0
but @entity12 agreed to meet the confidential source 's " @entity72 brother " -- the undercover @entity36 agent -- after the source told him the " brother " would be interested in helping			2
he told the agent that he wanted jihadist activities to be his " profession , " authorities said			0
on december 8 , he met the source to drive to a public parking lot near the recruiting center and attempted to detonate the device			1
on the way , he had the source videotape him saying he would continue to fight " against the oppressors until those who waged war with @entity57 stopped their actions , " the @entity11 said			0
" @entity12 admitted that the bomb was intended to kill military service members who worked in the building , " authorities said			2
" this is an example of another successful prosecution that resulted from outstanding partnerships between the @entity10 community and law enforcement , " said @entity92 , @entity36 special agent in charge , in a @entity11 statement			0
" as the threat from homegrown violent extremists remains high , the @entity36 and our police partners rely on a two - way flow of information with the @entity10 community at large			0
together we are working to stop those that have perverted the @entity57 faith into something it is not			0
" @entity12 's attorney argued in a december 2010 hearing that federal authorities set his client up in a sting operation			1
but @entity117 , the @entity9 attorney in @entity3 , said at the time federal authorities " do n't initiate these investigations unless there is a credible allegation that the defendant himself ( has ) already expressed an intent to cause harm			0
and secondly , throughout the investigation , the @entity36 seeks to clarify the defendant 's intent , challenging him , making certain that he 's expressly told that he does n't need to go forward with this			0
