-- his fans are literally throwing money at him			0
the @entity5 artist , activist and @entity8 sensation @entity7 has collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from fans who want to help him pay back taxes of $ 2.3 million			1
many are simply throwing the money into his @entity14 compound			0
" his supporters have folded 100 yuan notes -- the equivalent of $ 15.75 -- into paper airplanes that glided into the compound			0
others wrapped the money around pieces of fruit and hurled it over the wall , " the @entity20 wrote on its @entity22 blog			0
" or more traditionally @entity5 , they stuffed it into red envelopes			1
" @entity7 pays $ 1.3m tax bond over jail fears if you 're not one of his 110,000 @entity35 followers , you may never have heard of @entity7			1
but the architect who designed the @entity37 for the @entity38 in 2008 has become one of @entity5 's most noted political dissidents and online activists			1
at the recent @entity43 conference in @entity44 , @entity0 sat down with @entity45 , who spent several years following @entity7 for an upcoming documentary called " @entity7 : never sorry , " to learn more about his fame in @entity5 and his mastery of the @entity8			1
" the truth is i do n't believe it 's his art -- in terms of what 's shown in a museum -- that may have put him in the position that he 's in , " @entity45 said , referring to @entity7 's three - month detention , which ended in june , and the fact that he 's been targeted by @entity5 authorities as a dissident			1
" it 's really about how his life is his art. it 's about his activities , how he gives interviews very freely			0
he does not self - censor what he thinks , " she said			0
" it 's also the organizing he 's done online			0
part of his art includes underground documentaries that he films with collaborators and posts online for free			0
they have to do with the questions and conversation that he curates online -- first on his blog , until it was shut down , and now on @entity35			0
" @entity7 was able to use the @entity8 , to a degree , to circumvent authorities , she said			1
" in a society where all official media is subject to censorship -- from micro-blogs up to party papers -- that 's also an incredibly subversive thing to be able to connect to people , " @entity45 said			2
" and the truth is censorship can not be an all - knowing eye , and people are having very interesting conversations even within the firewall -- and on @entity35 , which is blocked in @entity5 , so people have to use technology to go outside the firewall			1
" @entity7 came late to technology but adopted it with gusto , she said			1
" @entity7 never used a computer -- never really knew how to type -- before 2005 , " she said			1
" and in 2005 he was invited by @entity106 , which is a big internet company in @entity5 , to have a celebrity blog			1
he was a well - known architect and artist , and he decided to take that on			2
his father was also a poet , so he was also interested in seeing how his writing chops or his literary chops were			0
and he immediately was drawn to the medium			0
he 's always been looking for ways to communicate -- and suddenly he saw the @entity8			0
" last year , @entity45 asked @entity7 about the biggest paradigm shift in his life			2
" his answer to me was the internet			2
' the internet is what affected me and has opened up so many doors and has ignited me			2
" now , as i 'm completing the documentary ... i really understand what that means			2
