three weeks ago , i had the privilege of visiting our civilian leaders and military commanders , as well as our troops , in @entity6			1
it was my fourth trip to the country and a vastly different one than my first visit in 2007			0
flying over @entity10 at night , i was struck by the changes : electric lights and even traffic are visible throughout the valley			0
i was encouraged by what i saw and by what i heard from ambassador @entity17 and general @entity18 the @entity6 are taking the lead for their own security , and now they are poised to successfully transition to a new government for the first time in their history			1
after 13 years , i am often asked why @entity6 still matters			1
the world is growing more complicated by the day , and , in my view , more dangerous			0
the responsibility is on leaders in @entity28 to remind the @entity30 people why finishing the job right in @entity6 remains important			1
the explanation is straightforward : not only was it the location from which the 9/11 attack that killed 3,000 @entity30 was planned , but the country also remains uniquely vulnerable to becoming a terrorist stronghold again if we do n't complete our work to empower the @entity6 people , security forces and government to protect their own country			1
our mission quite simply is to prevent another terrorist attack			0
and , there 's another reason we do n't talk about much , but it remains equally important			0
both friends and foes are watching to see whether @entity30 has the resolve to complete its task or if we will fall short of our mark out of fatigue or political expediency			1
this has ramifications not just for @entity6 but other critical areas where @entity30 has strategic national security interests			1
make no mistake , @entity6 remains a tough fight			2
the progress has been significant , but the country will continue to have setbacks			1
@entity65 , like the recent tragic shooting at a @entity10 hospital , is going to continue			0
terrorist organizations will continue to attempt high - profile attacks to break our resolve			0
but because of the courage and sacrifices of our deployed men and women , both military and civilian , i am optimistic that we can achieve our mission successfully if @entity28 does n't squander this progress			1
at the time of my visit , i said that i hoped @entity28 and @entity10 would always be worthy of the shared sacrifice and effort that our troops , the international community , and the @entity6 people have made			1
the biggest takeaway from my visit is that of all the challenges facing our strategy for @entity6 , the most potentially damaging and completely avoidable is quitting just short of the goal line			2
it 's essential that we do not repeat the same mistakes in @entity6 that we made in @entity94			2
before the end of this year , the @entity96 administration must reach a bilateral security agreement with the @entity6 government that reinforces our commitment to the @entity6 people and its security forces			2
with input from our commanders on the ground , this will likely require retaining a credible , residual troop presence to help continue to thwart terrorist networks as well as provide appropriate levels of training and advice to the @entity6 security forces as they continue to grow and mature into an effective , independent fighting force			1
as a former small business man , i like an analogy i heard on our efforts to train and assist the @entity117 : we 've helped them open for business , and now we need to ensure they have the processes and logistics in place to stay in business			0
our military has a clear , understandable plan to put themselves out of business at the end of this process			0
there is a shared , bipartisan legacy in @entity28 for @entity6			1
i am convinced history will judge both the executive branch and the legislative branch not on whether we ended wars , but how we ended them			1
it is increasingly apparent that the @entity30 left @entity94 too soon , and it is with heavy hearts that we see the black flags flying in areas of @entity94 where the @entity30 expended our most precious treasure , the blood of our fellow citizens			2
we can not let that happen in @entity6			2
a bilateral security agreement is critical if we 're going to successfully complete the work that has been accomplished to date and to help ensure that the gains we have made are not jeopardized like they have been in @entity94			0
@entity30 's foes , both state and non-state actors , are watching with great interest how we leave @entity6 , watching to see whether we leave after securing our interests and honoring our commitments , or if we just leave			1
and over the last year , our commander - in - chief has often talked more about leaving @entity6 than how we are going to achieve our mission			2
we all want to bring our remaining troops home as soon as possible , but succeeding in @entity6 is vital to our national security interests and it must take priority over any calendar dates			0
the president has an obligation to better make that case to the @entity30 people			0
and if he does , i will support him			0
for more than a decade , our troops and civilian personnel have fought to bring peace and security to @entity6 -- and to ensure it can never again be used as a safe haven for terrorists to attack the @entity30			1
many @entity30 have sacrificed to secure these goals , and far too many have lost their lives or suffered life - altering wounds			0
@entity28 and @entity10 must work together to secure the gains we have made together and complete our mission			0
join us on @entity179 / @entity178 .			0

house *speaker* @entity181 says the @entity30 needs to finish the job right in @entity6
the progress , he says , has been significant , but the country will continue to have setbacks
he argues that there is a shared , bipartisan legacy in @entity28 for @entity6
@entity181 : history will judge us not on whether we ended wars , but how we ended them
