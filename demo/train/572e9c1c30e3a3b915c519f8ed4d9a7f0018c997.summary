" we 're people too			2
i get out and i work every day			0
you know , it 's discrimination , " said @entity1 , who weighs 340 pounds			0
" we sincerely regret mr. @entity1 's unhappiness over his experience , " said @entity2 in an e-mailed statement			1
" we have personally called mr. @entity1 to offer him our apologies and better understand his concerns			2
it 's important to clarify that he did travel as scheduled -- we did not deny him boarding			0
our employee informed him of our policy , and he proceeded to travel as scheduled			2
" airline squeeze : it 's not you , it 's the seat ! @entity2 's " customer of size " policy suggests that customers purchase a second seat in advance if they know they 'll need it on the flight			1
the rule of thumb : not encroaching on " any part " of the neighboring seats			0
" the armrest is considered to be the definitive boundary between seats ; width between the armrests measures 17 inches			0
the purchase of additional seats serves as a notification to @entity2 of a special seating need , and allows us to adequately plan for the number of seats that will be occupied on the aircraft			1
" the airline will refund the cost of the second seat after the flight			1
as airlines pack more passengers into their aircraft and charge for amenities like legroom and first - on - board boarding rights , how do you think people who do n't fit into those seats should be treated by the airlines ? please share your comments below .			0
