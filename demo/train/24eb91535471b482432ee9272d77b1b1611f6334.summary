@entity0 -- @entity2 's urban rich are making far more than they officially report , suggesting the wealth gap in the world 's second largest economy is much higher than previously thought , according to a new study			1
the @entity8 released a survey monday that found " gray income " was 6.2 trillion yuan ( u.s. $ 1 trillion ) , or 12 % of gdp			1
" @entity17 income " can range from illegal cash from kickbacks to unreported income and gifts			2
" the result has highlighted expanding social inequalities and policy issues surrounding official corruption and income distribution , " said @entity18 , who led the research for the @entity8 , in an article in @entity21			0
" the richer the household , the more likely it receives shadow income			1
" the study comes a day after @entity31 , a once high - flying politician , was sentenced to life in prison for bribe - taking , 15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power			0
@entity31 is appealing the verdict			0
the @entity8 surveyed 5,344 urban families in 18 @entity2 provinces			2
the results suggest the top 10 % of households earn nearly 21 times more than the poorest 10 %			1
the @entity42 places income disparity far lower , saying @entity2 's wealthiest make 8.6 times more than its poorest			1
" @entity2 is in a dangerous zone as one the most unequal countries in the world , " @entity18 wrote			0
the survey found that rich families gain 80 % of their wealth from business and on average " have decent gains " in stock markets , whereas most middle and lower income families lose cash in the capital markets , @entity18 said			1
" we ca n't rule out that some of these business gains are problematic , or even illegal , because many survey takers count kickbacks as business gains , " he wrote			0
much of the high gray income is linked to the loose credit handed out between 2009 and 2010 , @entity18 wrote , as well as the rapid increase of government investment during the same period			2
" to stop widening income disparity and unfair allocation , in addition to anti-corruption campaigns , there needs to be gradual but firm progress in economic , political and social reform that moves the country closer to the rule of law with public scrutiny over administrative power , " he said .			0
