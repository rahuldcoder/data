-- did you know that the " frequency hopping " technology that is vital to much of our military technology and helps keep your cell phone and your gps devices secure was developed and patented by a famous movie star ? did you know that there was an amazing 16 - year - old patriot who outdid @entity10 , riding 45 miles in the pouring rain to warn @entity13 colonial militias that " the @entity14 are coming " ? did you know that there was a secret agent , code named " 355 , " who worked for @entity20 's band of spies , the @entity22 ? the agent supplied key intelligence on @entity14 activities during the @entity26 , and she was so good at keeping a secret that we still do n't know her real name			2
if you do n't know about all these people , it 's understandable			2
their stories are n't told widely or often -- perhaps because they were all women			1
for some reason or other , when the story of our country is told , women -- really great women -- have tended to be left out of the telling			1
you see the results everywhere you look : -- a survey of @entity47 history textbooks found that only 10 % of the individuals identified in the texts were women			1
-- less than 8 % of the 2,560 national historic landmarks chronicle the achievements of women			1
-- of the 210 statues in the @entity55 , only 15 are of female leaders			0
that 's the bad news			0
the good news is that thanks to a strong bipartisan effort in @entity62 , we may soon be one step closer to addressing this imbalance by establishing a @entity65 in @entity66			1
together , we have introduced a common - sense bill to move this idea forward			0
we have more than 73 bipartisan co-sponsors in the @entity70 , 19 in the @entity71 and a national coalition of women 's groups behind us			1
we recognize money is tight -- that 's why we 're not asking for taxpayer support			0
private donations would fund the museum 's construction and operation			0
a vital part of recognizing equal rights for women is acknowledging and commemorating the deep and lasting contributions women have made throughout history			2
when young people visit our nation 's capital , they should have a chance to be just as inspired by women 's accomplishments as men 's			2
we establish and operate museums , not just as some kind of giant drawer in which to store our memorabilia , but as way to celebrate our accomplishments , affirm our shared values and preserve the full and accurate story of our common history			2
and unfortunately , only half of that story is presently being told			1
the stories of courageous and pioneering @entity47 such as abolitionist @entity107 , astronaut @entity108 , @entity110 @entity109 and the founder of the @entity112 , @entity113 , will inform and inspire future generations			0
the remarkable women who helped to make this country what it is today deserve to have their histories told and preserved for the ages			1
their stories of success are the stories that will inspire and encourage millions of women			2
our daughters and our sons deserve the chance to learn the story -- the full story -- of how this amazing country came to be			1
and by the way , the movie star inventor ? that was @entity132			0
the 16 year - old who rode farther than @entity10 was @entity134			0
and the spy , code named " 355 " ? well , we still do n't know the name -- but we know the patriot was a " she			0
" and just wait until you see all the other amazing women and @entity47 history you 'll learn about one day soon when the @entity65 opens			1
join us on @entity145 / @entity144			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of rep. @entity148 , rep. @entity149 , sen. @entity150 and sen. @entity151 .			0

march is @entity153
four *members* of @entity62 are pushing for a @entity65
they say that as the story of our country is told , women have tended to be left out of the telling
