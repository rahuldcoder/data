four years ago , the discovery of 11 decomposed bodies inside an @entity3 home seemed like the kind of devastating , once - in - generations event that would spur change for the better			1
then , this spring , came the shocking allegations of three women who told police they 'd been held captive for years , sometimes raped and beaten , by a man named @entity11 , in a house just a few miles away			2
but , surely , it could n't happen again			0
last weekend , authorities found the bodies of three women , wrapped in plastic in a style reminiscent of the victims of serial killer @entity22 , the man sentenced to death in the 2009 case			0
it does raise questions : what 's up with @entity28 ? why so many high - profile crimes in such a short span ? why such violence against the metro area 's women ? @entity28 neighborhood struggles with horrors it 's the kind of question academics could spend an entire career researching and still not reach a satisfying answer			1
after all , the murder rate in @entity28 's metropolitan area is n't out of line with that of other @entity45 communities			1
and while more rapes are reported per capita than in many other cities , the director of a @entity28 rape center says there 's nothing particularly unusual about sexual violence there , compared with other cities			1
@entity28 's police department declined a @entity57 request to talk about the recent crimes			1
but to those who study the city , some patterns do emerge : crushing poverty , dehumanizing unemployment and thousands of tumbledown vacant homes -- ideal places to rape and kill in the shadows			1
" i hate to say this , but in a sense , to a large degree , we have an underclass in the city of @entity28 of those that truly are disconnected from the social fabric , from the mainstream economy and society , " said @entity68 , an urban studies professor at @entity69			1
" they 're left without anything to grasp onto			0
" @entity28 and poverty are no strangers			1
once a hub of the nation 's industrial might -- shipping out seemingly endless streams of iron , steel , machinery and automobiles from its perch on @entity94 -- the city that once housed nearly a million people now has barely a third of that population			2
in @entity3 , where authorities found the three bodies over the weekend , more than half of families with children under the age of 5 live in poverty , according to the @entity105			1
the median household income is half that of the nation as a whole			0
and @entity3 mayor @entity109 says 2,500 vacant and abandoned homes crowd his city 's three square miles			1
across @entity113 , home to the entire @entity28 metro area , about 76,000 residences are vacant , according to @entity116 figures			1
it 's a perfect environment for crime and social indifference to thrive , said @entity68			1
but that does n't explain what makes @entity28 different -- plenty of cities across the nation suffer from urban rot			2
maybe it 's a history of extreme racial disparity in @entity113 's justice system , crime author @entity126 says			2
he says such disparities drive a wedge between police and residents of impoverished areas , making them reluctant to go to authorities to report crime for fear they might be hassled by police themselves			2
that , he says , allowed criminals time and space to do their work and " created the perfect killing fields for these men			2
" @entity22 , for instance , killed for at least two years before he was caught			0
@entity11 snatched the first of his victims a decade before he was finally arrested			0
and authorities have not said how long they believe @entity3 's @entity152 , charged in the three most recent deaths , may have been killing			1
the bodies of his victims were badly decomposed , authorities said this week			0
one of them was found in an abandoned house			0
again , similar things could be said of many big cities , where pockets of social rot provide an ideal habitat for criminals to set up shop			0
" violence knows no boundaries , " @entity109 , the @entity3 mayor , told @entity57 's @entity168			1
" @entity169 occurs in @entity171			2
" indeed , @entity28 's raw violent crime statistics are n't particularly out of line with those of other big @entity45 cities			1
the city had 84 murders in 2012 and a violent crime rate of 1,386 for every 100,000 residents , according to @entity187 figures			0
that 's lower than @entity190 's crime rate and a pale shadow of @entity192 's , where 386 people were murdered in 2012 amid a crime rate one and a half times higher than @entity28 's			1
but the city 's rape statistics do seem to paint a somewhat different picture			0
in 2012 , police took reports on 92 rapes for every 100,000 residents -- more than double the rate in @entity190 or @entity192			0
only a few cities had a higher rate of reported rapes			0
that might suggest a particular problem with sexual violence against women in the @entity28 area , @entity68 said			2
" there are some things in the culture in this area where it appears that the lives of women in particular have been devalued , " he said			0
he said some men seem emasculated by their economic plight , and violence sometimes results			0
" they manifest their lack of control in a violent manner against women , " @entity68 said			0
" it might not always result in murder , but it often does in physical abuse			0
" @entity231 , who deals with rape victims as interim director of @entity28 's @entity234 , does n't think violence against women is any more a problem in @entity28 than in any other community			1
she believes that the data show that after years of high - profile cases in @entity28 , more people are willing to report rape and sexual assault			1
could it be just something in the city 's dna ? outrageous crimes are not a new phenomenon : in the 1930s , dismembered bodies kept turning up in the city 's @entity253 area , a string of killings that to this day remains unsolved			2
and , as crime author @entity126 points out , the city was once famous for its burning river , once dubbed the " @entity263 " and branded with an outsized inferiority complex after decades of being the butt of national jokes			2
" you live here , you grow up here , and there is some kind of weird vibe in the air here that anything 's possible , " he said			0
whatever 's going on , @entity231 says , residents ca n't help but wonder , " why here ? why us ? " as @entity28 's gritty side goes on display once again in the national media			1
" i do think we 're all asking how this happens in a city i love and care deeply about , " @entity231 said			0
" we definitely have more questions than we have answers at this point			0

@entity28 is the site of three national *headline* - *grabbing* crimes in four years
poverty , vacant homes create perfect environment for crime , *experts* say
but others question whether there 's anything unique about @entity28
" @entity169 knows no boundaries , " @entity3 mayor @entity109 says
