humanitarian organization @entity10 , also known as @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , says it was preparing to vaccinate around 100,000 people in southern and western @entity6 against meningitis , when it was told to leave the country			1
" we were in the process of organizing a vaccination campaign			0
at the moment there 's no one there that can take over those activities , which is really worrying , " @entity19 of @entity10 told @entity2			0
the country 's @entity26 officially declared a meningitis outbreak on march 2 at the @entity29 , which shelters more than 90,000 refugees in southern @entity6			1
" living in such close proximity , the potential for this outbreak to spread quickly is quite high , @entity34 , @entity10 project coordinator for @entity6 , told @entity2			2
" with no health care providers to give vaccinations , and with no one to manage the meningitis cases when they come , it 's really concerning , " she added			2
the vaccination campaign was due to begin on march 7 , but it is now unclear if or when it will resume , as reports of government harassment of aid workers continue			1
@entity34 told @entity2 she experienced no harassment , and said government officials had been in contact with only the head of @entity10 's regional operations			2
" we have n't actually been given any reason on why we were expelled , " she said			0
" we have absolutely no idea when we 'll be able to return			0
" @entity10 was among 13 aid agencies , including @entity57 and the @entity58 , that were ordered by the government to shut down their operations in @entity61 last week			1
so far the agency has confirmed 32 meningitis cases and four deaths , and has seen dozens of other suspected cases			0
thousands of unvaccinated refugees and villagers are now exposed to the airborne disease in densely populated camps and villages throughout @entity61			0
" one of our priorities is to get another organization to take over our programs there , " @entity34 added			0
the medical relief agency says it doubts though that other any other organizations have the capacity to deal with a meningitis epidemic			0
@entity34 also said she is worried about the cut - off of @entity10 's feeding and maternal delivery services : " we had over 100 patients on our feeding program that now wo n't be receiving any follow up			0
" the decision by the @entity90 government to throw out the aid groups came a day after the @entity92 at the @entity93 issued an arrest warrant for @entity90 president @entity95 for war crimes and crimes against humanity in @entity6			1
however , not all international aid organizations are affected			0
others including @entity101 continues its work , which reaches approximately 500,000 internally displaced people in @entity61			0
the @entity104 has received reports that international staff members of five non-governmental organizations had been detained for up to four hours			1
speaking on the phone from @entity109 , an aid worker , who asked not to be identified for fear of further harassment , told @entity2 that his colleagues who remained in @entity116 were being intimidated and threatened by government agents			2
in some cases @entity90 government representatives " had started gathering banking details and confiscating computers , communications equipment and vehicles from the @entity126 " , a @entity104 spokesman said at a news conference last week			1
last week , the @entity104 warned that the loss of @entity126 in @entity61 would cause 1.1 million people to go without food aid and health care , and more than 1 million to have no access to water			1
@entity133 , whose work focuses on providing safe drinking water , was one of the aid groups who were told their registration to operate in @entity61 was no longer valid			0
ninety percent of their staff are @entity90 nationals , who mostly remain in country , unable to continue their relief work under threat of arrest			2
" these agencies are vital implementation partners for the @entity104 and account for at least half of the humanitarian capacity in @entity6 , " said @entity148 , @entity104 deputy @entity149 at the news conference in @entity152 .			1
