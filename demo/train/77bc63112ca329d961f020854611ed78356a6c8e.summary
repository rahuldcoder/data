-- @entity1 used the promise of a puppy to lure @entity1 into the @entity5 home where he held her hostage for 11 years			1
" he tells me , ' just come in for a little while			0
you can take one home to your son , ' " @entity1 said in an interview broadcast tuesday on the syndicated " @entity11 " talk show			1
but she soon realized there were no puppies inside @entity1 's home			1
and it was n't long , @entity1 said , before he trapped her in an upstairs room and tied her up with an extension cord			1
from there , he took her down into the basement about 24 hours later , she said			0
it was the beginning of more than a decade of torture , rape , starvation and beatings for @entity1			1
the hope of seeing her son again , she said , inspired her fight to survive			1
" i want my son to know me as a victor , not a victim , " @entity1 told host dr. @entity34			1
" and i wanted him to know that i survived , loving him			0
his love got me through			0
" @entity1 lured @entity1 into his vehicle from a @entity40 in @entity5 in 2002 , promising to give her a ride			1
she was the first of three women he would capture and imprison in his home for about a decade			0
they were freed in may after one of the women , @entity1 , called out to neighbors for help			1
in august , @entity1 was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years after he pleaded guilty to 937 counts , including murder and kidnapping			1
he committed suicide in his prison cell in september			0
@entity1 , @entity56 and the third woman , @entity1 , have since been trying to readjust to life as free women			1
@entity1 , whose disappearance generated the least public notice of the three , has been the most outspoken			1
" after 11 years , i am finally being heard , and it 's liberating , " she said in a powerful statement at @entity1 's sentencing , describing the abuse she endured			1
her interview with " @entity11 , " which began airing tuesday and is set to continue wednesday , provides a detailed glimpse into some of the horrors she suffered and her struggle to survive			1
" how she continued to put one foot in front of the other during these 11 years is just very humbling			0
i mean , i said to her during the interview , ' @entity1 , i will never complain about another thing the rest of my life , ' " @entity34 told @entity0 's @entity76			1
" when you realize what she went through , it makes everything else seem so trivial			1
" ' it 's @entity85 's will if you die ' @entity1 said she remembered the warning , the one @entity1 delivered while wrapping a chain around her neck and shackling her to a metal pole in the basement of his @entity5 home			1
" now , if i do it too tight and you do n't make it , that means you was n't meant to stay here			2
that means @entity85 wanted to take you , " @entity1 said , according to @entity1			1
@entity1 told @entity34 she sometimes spent days in the basement , chained to the pole , unable to lie down and with a motorcycle helmet over her head			1
the helmet made it hard to breathe , she said , " and later on i did n't remember a thing ' cause i had passed out			0
" a photograph of the pole showed white paint had been scraped away			0
" that 's where i tried to get out , " @entity1 said			1
" and i could n't pull the pole down because i was n't strong enough			0
" @entity1 told @entity34 that she did n't always fight back , though , at least not at first			1
she said she was in shock after being taken and all she could do was cry and beg him to let her go back to her son			2
several attempts to escape were met with harsh punishment , she said			0
" he took a pipe and he held it ... over my head , and he said , ' if you scream , i 'll ram this down your throat and i 'll kill you , ' " @entity1 recalled , describing what she said was @entity1 's response after she used a pair of pliers and a wire cutter to remove a chain around her neck			1
" so i did n't scream			0
i did n't make a noise			2
" @entity1 returns to @entity5 house where she was held for 11 years other victims @entity1 , 32 , was 21 years old when she was reported missing in 2002			1
@entity1 , she said , would tell her of his plans to abduct other women and also implied he 'd done it before			1
she said he showed her an area in the basement where it said , " @entity142			0
" " i begged him not to bring any more there to suffer the hell i went through , " @entity1 said			1
but it was n't long before @entity1 learned that she was n't the only captive			1
in 2003 , @entity56 joined her inside the house			0
at first , she said , they rarely saw each other			0
" when we did , it was like a quick hug and ' bye , ' because he would n't let us stay in the same room for that long , " she said			0
when they were in separate rooms , @entity1 said , she would blare her television if she saw @entity56 's mother on air , to make sure @entity56 knew to watch			1
and when she saw @entity56 , @entity1 said , she tried to comfort her			1
" sometimes she would cry , and i 'd tell her everything would be ok , and that one day we 'll get home , " @entity1 told @entity34			1
" we just have to , you know , wait it out			0
" @entity1 's main ' punching bag ' since their release , accounts have depicted @entity1 as someone who cared for the other victims during their captivity while also enduring great suffering herself			2
a family friend of one of the victims said this year that @entity1 used @entity1 as his main " punching bag			2
" the friend said @entity1 hit @entity1 with a variety of objects , including hand weights			2
she has suffered vision loss , joint and muscle damage , and other problems from her time in captivity			0
according to an initial incident report obtained by @entity0 , @entity1 said she became pregnant at least five times while in @entity1 's home			2
in the interview with @entity34 , @entity1 said she once watched @entity1 kill a beloved dog by breaking its neck			2
she said she was kept nearly naked in a frigid room with windows boarded up			0
and she said @entity1 once punched her in the stomach with a barbell when he learned she was pregnant			1
" i fell to the floor			0
... he said , ' tomorrow it 'd better be gone			0
that 's all he said , ' " @entity1 recalled			2
" then when i did miscarry , he blamed me			2
he said that i hated him , that i killed his kid , and he punched me in the face , saying that it was all my fault			2
" a troubled past during @entity1 's time in captivity , her case got less media attention than the disappearances of @entity56 and @entity211 , whose family members posted fliers and held candlelight vigils for them			2
@entity1 's grandmother , @entity216 , told @entity217 in may that the family had concluded that @entity1 had left of her own accord because she was angry that she had lost custody of her then - 2 - year - old son			1
that conclusion was supported by police and social workers , she told the newspaper			0
@entity1 told @entity34 that her son was taken away after her mother 's boyfriend abused him			1
" and then they tried to say that i never protected him , and i did , " she said			0
" i did all i could do			0
" she was still trying to do all she could on the day when she was abducted in 2002 , @entity1 said			2
she told @entity34 she got lost on the way to a meeting with social services to discuss her son 's custody			2
that 's when she stopped at the dollar store to ask for directions , she said , and when @entity1 offered her a ride			2
in the interview , @entity1 also gave a glimpse into what she described as a troubled childhood before her abduction , which she said was why she did n't want to see her mother after she was released			1
" i wished my mother was n't my mother			0
... i was n't allowed out			0
i was n't allowed to have friends			0
she made sure i was dumber than a doorknob , " she said			0
in response , her mother , @entity250 , issued a statement to the " @entity11 " show			2
" @entity1 , my daughter , has been the victim of long - term and profound and unspeakable torture			2
her point of view has been altered by that monster and what he did to her , " the statement said			0
" what i have heard that she said about me breaks my heart			0
that is because what she now believes , while not true , increases her pain			0
i always have and always will			0
i pray that someday she will heal enough to know that again			0
