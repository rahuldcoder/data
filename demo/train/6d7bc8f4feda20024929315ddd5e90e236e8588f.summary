-- it 's been difficult for die - hard fans of " @entity3 " to let go of the main character , @entity5 -- and it turns out it 's not been easy for the actor who portrayed him , either			1

" with @entity5 , over the course of six years , i covered it all			1
i could kill someone ; i could caress my baby and kiss my son on the forehead			2
the whole spectrum of the human experience			0
" the actor has taken on the role of president @entity33 in the @entity35 production of " @entity36 " and said the current president could learn a thing or two from the former leader			1
" there are two things @entity33 had that our current president does n't have , " @entity10 told parade			1
" one is extensive experience in @entity46			0

so he was ready to make deals and trades			0
" " the second thing is the ( political ) climate			0
in @entity33 's time , politicians knew they 'd have to cross the aisle : ' our philosophies might be opposite , but i 'm going to try to work with them			1
' and what we have now is a digging - your - heels - in : ' they are trying to hurt the country			0
only our way is the right way ' -- whether you 're in the @entity67 or @entity68 camp			0
it is so polarizing and distrustful and disrespectful			0

" i initially turned it down -- i thought , ' i ca n't do " @entity73 " after " @entity3 " ; that 's a huge step down , ' " he said			2
" but i was surprised at the level of the writing , and the director , @entity83 , had some great ideas to strengthen the heart of the story			0
and why not do something that 's fun and escapist ? so i got down off my high horse and said , ' yeah , let 's do it			0
