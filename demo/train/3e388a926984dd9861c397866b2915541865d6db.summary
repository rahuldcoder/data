@entity40 : focus back on @entity7 the @entity3 lawsuit contends that @entity7 is responsible for @entity3 's death because it hired and supervised dr. @entity2 , who was administering the surgical anesthetic propofol to @entity3 each night for a month to induce sleep as he prepared for a series of concerts organized by @entity7			1
a jury found dr. @entity2 guilty of involuntary manslaughter after hearing testimony that he violated medical standards in his treatment of @entity3			0
" dr. @entity2 's choice to keep quiet puts the focus back on the company , @entity7 , that hired dr. @entity2 and agreed to pay him over $ 1.5 million a year , and provide @entity2 with a large house and drivers and other perks , to make sure that the company 's biggest asset , @entity3 , made it to the shows on time , no matter what , " @entity27 , the @entity40 ' lawyer said			1

" they have had all of their claims dismissed except negligent hiring , and they do n't want dr. @entity2 to be deposed because he will tell them what he already told the police : that he worked for @entity3 ; that @entity3 , not @entity7 , was his employer ; and that @entity3 personally invited him to join the ' this is it ' tour long before anyone at @entity7 had even heard of him			2

e-mails the @entity3 's plan to use in their case suggested that the promoter was worried about @entity3 's missed rehearsals and they sought @entity2 's help in getting him ready			2
@entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 and their grandmother contend that @entity7 's pressure on @entity2 to have @entity3 ready for daily rehearsals despite his fragile health led to his death from the propofol overdose			1
a cornerstone of the @entity40 ' case is an e-mail @entity7 co-ceo @entity155 wrote 11 days before @entity3 's death			1
the e-mail to show director @entity158 addressed concerns that @entity2 had kept @entity3 from a rehearsal the day before : " we want to remind ( @entity2 ) that it is @entity7 , not @entity3 , who is paying his salary			2
we want to remind him what is expected of him			0
" @entity3 lawyers , calling it a " smoking gun , " argue the e-mail is evidence that @entity7 used @entity2 's fear of losing his $ 150,000 - a - month job as @entity3 's personal physician to pressure him to have @entity3 ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health			1
