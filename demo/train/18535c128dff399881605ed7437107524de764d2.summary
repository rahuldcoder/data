read the report on veterans ' homeless rates ( @entity31 ) the @entity18 says veterans become homeless for many reasons , including mental health issues and substance abuse			1
but it notes that female veterans can face additional challenges , such as sexual abuse			1
female veterans are also more likely to be single parents , the @entity18 says , which can make it more difficult to find adequate housing			1
@entity13 ' luck changed at a job fair when she met @entity48 , a captain with the @entity49			1
within days , @entity48 had helped @entity13 and her daughter move to a transitional home where they could stay until they got back on their feet			1

" not every veteran is living under a bridge , " @entity48 said			1
" not all veterans have mental issues			1
not all veterans have experienced substance abuse			2
some veterans have just fallen on hard times			2
" when they do fall , it can be hard for female veterans with children to find housing , according to the @entity77			1

as a single mother , @entity48 joined the @entity137 to make a better life for herself and her young son			1
she was based in @entity140 and set to deploy to @entity141 in 2005 when her life was turned upside down			0
@entity48 and her son were fine -- she 'd already sent him to live with a relative in @entity146 while she prepared to deploy -- but the family lost everything , and @entity48 became homeless			1
a month later , she was diagnosed with head , neck and throat cancer			0
she underwent surgery and radiation treatment at @entity154 in @entity155 , but she was eventually discharged from the @entity137 because of her illness			0
when @entity48 asked the @entity18 what assistance was available for her , she was told they did n't have any programs that could help with the challenges she was facing as a female veteran with a dependent child			1
they referred her to local social services , which @entity48 called probably the most demeaning experience of her life			1
" you 're treated basically as a baby 's mama or a crack head , or some woman who 's made a bunch of bad decisions with her life , and the only resources available were welfare , " @entity48 said			1
" i 'm not a welfare mom , i 'm a soldier			0
" @entity48 joined her young son in @entity146 , where she was able to eventually get her life back together			2
today , her cancer is in remission , and she lives with her son , her new husband and their son in @entity88 , where she is on active duty with the @entity49			2
for years , @entity48 considered her experience an isolated incident			2
but when she realized that other female veterans were struggling , too , she decided to take action			1
for her , it 's part of the oath she swore to uphold when she entered the service			0
" as a soldier , you raise your right hand , and with that comes certain responsibilities , " she said			0
" one of those is to never leave a fallen comrade			0
... so whether they 're in or out of uniform , they have me if they need me			0
" @entity48 's help has given @entity13 the break she needed			2
" i have a job now , and i got promoted in like two weeks , " @entity13 said			0
" i 'm really at peace here , and i can focus on what my next steps are			0
... @entity210 set me up for success			0
" @entity48 is determined to help as many female veterans as she can			1
at the end of the month , she 'll be getting another opportunity when she starts her dream job : working in women veterans outreach at the @entity18			2
one way or another , her ultimate goal is to make organizations like hers obsolete			0
" i do n't have a blueprint , but i 'm going to figure it out , " she said			0
