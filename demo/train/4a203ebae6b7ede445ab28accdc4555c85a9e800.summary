a keynote speech on the @entity3 's biggest stage			1
is it 2004 again ? @entity6 mayor @entity5 gave the most significant speech of his political career on tuesday night when he became the first @entity9 to deliver the keynote address at the @entity11			1
" my grandmother did n't live to see us begin our lives in public service			0
but she probably would 've thought it extraordinary that just two generations after she arrived in @entity6 , one grandson would be the mayor and the other would be on his way -- the good people of @entity6 willing -- to the @entity25 , " @entity5 said in his speech , referring to his twin brother , @entity17			1
" my family 's story is n't special			2
what 's special is the @entity29 that makes our story possible			2
" @entity34 is a nation like no other -- a place where great journeys can be made in a single generation ... no matter who you are or where you come from , the path is always forward			0
" comparisons to the 2004 @entity44 are inevitable			1
the then - @entity46 state sen. @entity44 gave the same address in @entity48 , launching him onto the fast track for the presidential nomination four years later			1
@entity5 , 37 , shrugs off the similarities and talk that he could eventually become the first @entity9 president			1
@entity11 speech to focus on @entity56 @entity55 family experience " oh , i would be lying if i said that 's not flattering			1
of course it 's flattering to anybody , " he said last week from @entity6			1
" but the biggest mistake i can make in this situation is to believe the press , to believe the hype			0
" that humble response can be attributed to his modest upbringing			0
@entity5 's grandmother immigrated to @entity66 from @entity67 as an orphan at the age of six			1
she taught herself to read and write in @entity70 , eventually finding work in @entity6 as a maid and a cook			2
@entity5 's mother , @entity74 , learned a tough lesson at a young age while in school in @entity6 , where her teachers discouraged speaking @entity70			1
" they would charge us a quarter if you were caught speaking @entity70 , and incidentally that 's how much lunch cost , " @entity74 said			2
" we were put down so often that the message was clear -- @entity70 was a bad language that should n't be spoken			0
" as a result , @entity5 and his brother , @entity17 , grew up in a home where @entity70 was rarely spoken			2
neither speaks the language fluently			0
" i understand @entity70 better than i speak it , " @entity5 admits			2
it was @entity74 who inspired @entity5 's political future			1
while in college she became president of the @entity95 at @entity96 in @entity6			2
out of college , she joined the @entity99 movement , working with the " @entity100 " to fight for reforms beneficial to the @entity56 - @entity55 community			1
in 1971 , @entity74 ran for @entity103 and lost the race			0
along the way , though , she took her sons to various community and political events where they witnessed battles for voting rights and an end to discrimination on city services			0
" i dragged them to every meeting , rally and voting booth , " @entity74 said			0
" they helped me on different campaigns and handed out literature			0
i wanted them to realize it is your duty to be involved			0
" now , less than two weeks shy of his 38th birthday , @entity5 , a graduate of @entity127 and @entity129 's @entity128 , is the youngest mayor of a @entity55 city			1
at age 26 , he was the youngest councilman ever elected in @entity6			2
@entity133 , who introduced his twin tuesday night , is a politician in his own right -- currently running for the @entity136 in a contest @entity3 leaders expect him to win			1
" since they were young , i imagined they would do great things , " @entity74 said of her sons			0
a source familiar with @entity5 's speech set the bar high for the @entity6 mayor , saying it was akin to @entity44 's career - making 2004 address			1
@entity5 himself says he 'll focus on his own story of achieving the @entity55 dream			1
who is the next @entity44 ? he drew a link for those working to write their own success story , addressing what he said in an interview was the " clear choice that voters have in this election , and why the policies that president @entity44 has put forth make more sense to creating opportunity , bringing the middle class back , and assuring prosperity in the future			1
" " we need to make a choice			0
it 's a choice ... between a country where the middle class pays more , so that millionaires can pay less ... or a country where everybody pays their fair share			0
it 's a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts @entity183 grants ... or a nation that invests more in education			0
it 's a choice between a politician who rewards companies that ship @entity55 jobs overseas ... or a leader who brings jobs back home , " @entity5 said			1
" this is the choice before us			0
and to me , to my generation , and for all the generations that will come after us , our choice is clear			0
our choice is a man who 's always chosen us			0
a man who already is our president -- @entity44			2
" the choice of @entity5 for the convention 's keynote address is strategic in an election where the @entity9 vote will be key			1
@entity44 handily won the demographic 's vote in 2008 over @entity208 @entity207 and it will be pivotal for him to do the same in november			1
the @entity211 campaign also knows the importance of @entity9 voters			2
last week 's @entity208 convention in @entity215 had no shortage of prominent @entity9 speakers , including @entity219 sen. @entity218 , a @entity220 who was among those in consideration for @entity211 's vice presidential pick			1
@entity44 's advantage over @entity211 among the politically imperative demographic remains steady from previous months , with the president taking 61 % to @entity211 's 29 % of registered @entity9 voters ' support in august , according to a @entity231 survey			1
@entity211 's campaign has publicly identified a " magic number " for the @entity9 vote if the former @entity235 governor has a chance of winning the election : 38 %			1
@entity207 garnered 31 % of the @entity9 vote in 2008			1
but latino interest in the 2012 election appears to be lagging			0
compared with the 2008 election cycle , @entity9 interest levels in 2012 are 10 points behind where they were in the previous election , according to an @entity248 - @entity247 - @entity246 poll conducted in july			1
amid the lagging support , the @entity249 announced in june a bold new policy that halts deportations of some young immigrants who came to @entity29 illegally as children			0
the policy is a " temporary " measure that allows eligible immigrants to apply for work permits and deportation deferral for a two - year period			0
@entity5 acknowledges with a smile the strategy behind his prominent speaking role : " obviously i 'm young and i 'm also @entity9 , two important groups in this election			1
and i 'm confident that i can do a good job in articulating why president @entity44 ought to be the candidate that @entity29 select for the next four years			2
" since being elected in 2009 , @entity5 has built a reputation as " a youthful and dynamic leader here in town , " says @entity270 , assistant professor of political science at the @entity272			2
" in a lot of ways , this speech is an initial test on the national stage , " @entity270 says , predicting that if @entity5 is successful at the convention , it gives the party a new confidence that he indeed is a rising @entity3 star			1
" it 's definitely a symbolically significant speech for the mayor			1
it sets the tone for where the @entity3 thinks its future is headed , " @entity270 said			2
@entity6 @entity208 are skeptical of @entity5 's broader appeal , with one @entity6 official calling him a " typical young , energetic @entity289			1
" he " believes in big government , tax and spend , and those type of things , " said @entity290 , treasurer of the @entity208 of @entity291			0
@entity296 , president of the @entity297 of @entity6 , echoed those comments			0
" he 's a tax - and - spend liberal			0
he does not represent all @entity9 , we 're not all the same , " @entity296 said			0
before his speech , the young mayor tuesday appeared to be more nervous about using a teleprompter for only the second time rather than for the high expectations surrounding his address			2
" in the end , the @entity55 dream is not a sprint , or even a marathon , but a relay , " @entity5 said			1
" our families do n't always cross the finish line in the span of one generation			0
but each generation passes on to the next the fruits of their labor			0
my grandmother never owned a house			0
she cleaned other people 's houses so she could afford to rent her own			0
but she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college			0
and my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop , i could hold this microphone			0
" democrats to highlight @entity44 's tough decisions			2
