@entity0 was n't the first to use the a-word -- apartheid -- when talking about @entity3 , and he likely wo n't be the last			1
even some @entity3 leaders have mentioned the word that basically means " separate " in describing the eventual result if a jewish state had a @entity9 majority in some areas , such as currently exists in the @entity11			1
however , the @entity13 secretary of state touched a diplomatic live wire last week when he predicted an apartheid situation if @entity3 and the @entity9 fail to agree on a two - state solution for their decades - long conflict			1
@entity20 sen. @entity19 of @entity21 , a tea party favorite and possible presidential candidate , called for @entity0 's resignation , while @entity27 groups accused @entity29 's top diplomat of inappropriate language and insensitivity			1
the backlash reflected both the hyper - partisanship of a @entity13 election year and the high stakes of @entity37 peace talks pushed by @entity0 that have effectively broken down in the latest episode of a dispute that seems to define the word intractable			1
" unwise , ill - timed and ill - advised " " this was unwise , ill - timed and ill - advised for sure , but it 's not going to make much of a difference frankly in the overall arc of the process that 's promising only diminishing returns , " said @entity41 , a former @entity13 negotiator on the @entity3 - @entity9 issue			1
@entity0 issued a statement on monday acknowledging he used the wrong word in comments to a closed - door meeting of the @entity53 of private sector leaders from @entity29 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
at the same time , he vigorously defended his long - held support for @entity3 and commitment to finding a two - state solution to the @entity37 conflict			1
" i will not allow my commitment to @entity3 to be questioned by anyone , particularly for partisan , political purposes , so i want to be crystal clear about what i believe and what i do n't believe , " he said			0
" i have been around long enough to also know the power of words to create a mis - impression , even when unintentional , and if i could rewind the tape , i would have chosen a different word to describe my firm belief that the only way in the long term to have a jewish state and two nations and two peoples living side by side in peace and security is through a two - state solution , " he added			0
apartheid was the reviled system of racial segregation implemented by the white - minority government in @entity87 for decades before the country transitioned to a multiparty democracy that was first led by @entity90			0
a series of laws determined where black @entity87 could live , work and go to school , who they could marry , and even which beaches they could use			0
the intent was to maintain power for the white minority while stripping blacks of all rights of citizenship			0
in the rhetoric of the @entity37 dispute , @entity9 nationalists and others have accused @entity3 of apartheid - like policies , an accusation vehemently denied by @entity3 authorities			1
palestinians with citizenship rights comprise a minority of @entity3 's population , but non-citizen @entity9 in the @entity11 and other territories face severe security restrictions that limit their movement and other basic freedoms			2
palestinians in @entity3 some @entity3 officials have acknowledged that failure to reach a peace agreement that creates a @entity9 state alongside the jewish state would result in @entity127 palestinians living in @entity3 without the same rights as @entity3 citizens , including the right to vote			0
" as long as in this territory west of the @entity134 there is only one political entity called @entity3 , it is going to be either non-jewish or non-democratic , " former prime minister @entity131 said in 2010 when he was defense minister			0
" if this bloc of millions of @entity9 can not vote , that will be an apartheid state			0
" other @entity3 who have warned about a future apartheid state include former prime minister @entity142 and justice minister @entity143 , the government 's chief negotiator			2
@entity0 's statement cited such comments , saying that " in the long term , a unitary , binational state can not be the democratic jewish state that @entity3 deserves or the prosperous state with full rights that the @entity9 people deserve			1
" like @entity0 , @entity3 officials also have warned of potential increased violence from a growing @entity9 independence movement without a two - state agreement , as well as possible increased international condemnation for the situation on the ground			1
tuesday was the nine - month deadline @entity0 set last year for coming up with some form of agreement in the talks			2
despite @entity0 's repeated trips to the region to try to push the negotiations forward , the process hit a road block last week when the @entity9 announced they would combine rival movements @entity170 and @entity171 to form a unity government			1
@entity3 's @entity173 subsequently announced the country wo n't hold talks with a @entity9 government that includes @entity171 , which the @entity13 considers a terrorist organization			1
international pressure @entity9 negotiator @entity179 issued a statement tuesday that blamed @entity3 for the breakdown in the talks and said " we believe that the international community must now do what is needed , in order to make clear to @entity3 that choosing settlements and apartheid over peace has a political , legal and economic cost			2
" @entity0 's controversial comments were reported sunday by the @entity191 , based on a secret recording of his remarks			1
before his statement monday that served as confirmation of the @entity191 report , critics attacked			0
the @entity198 called the apartheid remark " deeply troubling , " while @entity200 , national director of the @entity201 , issued a statement calling reports that @entity0 used such language " startling and deeply disappointing			0
" " even if he used the repugnant language of @entity3 's adversaries and accusers to express concern for @entity3 's future , it was undiplomatic , unwise and unfair , " @entity200 said			2
" such references are not seen as expressions of friendship and support			0
" @entity216 majority leader @entity215 , a @entity217 @entity20 who is the highest - ranking @entity218 member of @entity219 , said the word apartheid " has routinely been dismissed as both offensive and inaccurate , and secretary @entity0 's use of it makes peace even harder to achieve			1
" @entity19 said @entity0 should step down because " there is no place for this word in the context of the state of @entity3			1
" on tuesday , other @entity20 also weighed in			0
" the secretary of state of the @entity13 -- his words or her words -- carry great weight , " @entity20 sen. @entity230 of @entity231 told @entity232			0
" and i think what the secretary said was hurtful and harmful and he should have apologized			0
" @entity13 politics at play some democrats also criticized @entity0			2
@entity244 sen. @entity243 chided him for improperly expressing his frustration over the foundering peace talks			0
@entity243 faces a tough re-election race in november in his traditionally @entity20 state			0
support for @entity3 is an essential policy for candidates seeking to win votes from the political right and center			0
meanwhile , some @entity27 voices backed @entity0 's analysis of the situation			2
in a statement on its website , the @entity13 group @entity258 said " @entity3 today is not an apartheid state , and that 's not what secretary of state @entity0 said			1
" " for over a year now , @entity0 has argued that , without a two - state solution , @entity3 is risking its future and its values as it moves toward permanent rule over millions of @entity9 without equal rights , " said the @entity258 statement			1
" former prime ministers @entity131 and @entity142 have used the ' apartheid ' term as well to describe this possible future			0
instead of putting energy into attacking secretary @entity0 , those who are upset with the secretary 's use of the term should put their energy into opposing and changing the policies that are leading @entity3 down this road			2
" at the @entity282 on tuesday , spokeswoman @entity281 made a similar point when reporters grilled her about whether @entity0 's statement the night before amounted to an apology			1
" he still believes that , as many @entity3 officials have stated , there would be challenges to a unitary state , " @entity281 said			0
former president @entity291 came under similar criticism when he published a book on the @entity37 conflict titled " @entity295 : peace , not apartheid " in 2006			2
" most of the criticisms of the book have been the one word in the title , ' apartheid , ' " @entity291 said in 2007 , adding that the " mandatory separation " inside the @entity9 territories and " terrible persecution and oppression of the @entity9 by the @entity3 " was " a basic issue that has got to be corrected before @entity3 can have peace			0

sec. @entity0 takes heat for saying what some @entity3 leaders have expressed
critics call @entity0 's remarks " undiplomatic , " " ill - advised "
the backlash reflects @entity13 election - year politics and the *volatile* @entity37 conflict
