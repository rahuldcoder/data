-- in a joint opinion piece to be published friday , the leaders of the @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 lay out in stark terms their contention that @entity9 's future must not include its leader , @entity10			1
" it is unthinkable that someone who has tried to massacre his own people can play a part in their future government , " said the article , titled " @entity9 's @entity12 , " by @entity2 president @entity13 , @entity3 prime minister @entity14 and @entity4 president @entity15			1
" it would be an unconscionable betrayal			0
" the article , which is slated to appear in the @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27 , was sent to reporters by the @entity29			0
because @entity10 has lost the consent of his people , " any deal that leaves him in power would lead to further chaos and lawlessness , " it says			2
" we know from bitter experience what that would mean			0
neither @entity42 , the region , or the world can afford a new safe haven for extremists			0
" the leaders called for an end to violence and for the regime 's forces to pull back from the embattled cities of @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , which have been besieged by @entity9 government forces			1
" however , so long as @entity10 is in power , @entity57 must maintain its operations so that civilians remain protected and the pressure on the regime builds , " they wrote			0
" then a genuine transition from dictatorship to an inclusive constitutional process can really begin , led by a new generation of leaders			0
in order for that transition to succeed , @entity10 must go and go for good			1
" @entity69 : terms for @entity10 " non-negotiable " at that point , they added , " the @entity73 and its members should help the @entity9 people as they rebuild where @entity10 has destroyed -- to repair homes and hospitals , to restore basic utilities , and to assist @entity9 as they develop the institutions to underpin a prosperous and open society			1
" the decision about who will replace the current @entity9 leaders will be left up to the @entity9 themselves , they said .			2

" @entity10 must go , and go for good , " leaders of @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 say
after @entity10 's exit , @entity73 *countries* will help @entity9 rebuild , the op - ed says
despite *international* help , @entity9 alone will *choose* their next leaders , op - ed says
