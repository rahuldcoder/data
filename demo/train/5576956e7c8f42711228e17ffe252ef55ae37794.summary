-- there 's no question that i find @entity4 sexy			1
if i lived in " @entity6 " land for a day , i would totally make out with him on his @entity6 purchased desk			1
in real life ? not so much			2
@entity4 of " @entity6 " is a complicated man underneath a confident exterior , columnist warns			1
what makes @entity4 so drool - worthy on screen does not translate in real life			1
actually , certain things do translate -- tall , dark and handsome is still tall , dark , and handsome in the real world			0
but that aloof , secretive , and calculating personality that seduces his onscreen paramours and the show 's viewers ? not easy to live with			2
@entity4 is written as an extremely complicated and deeply flawed man who does some awful things , like cheating repeatedly on his wife , @entity23 , and using information he gleans from her therapist to manipulate her			1
but the reasons and motivations behind his repulsive actions are slowly being revealed with each new episode			0
as with any tv show or movie , we itch to know what possesses someone to do the things he does , and we expect that writers as glorious as the ones behind " @entity6 " will eventually lead us to deep understanding of who @entity4 is and how he will evolve into a better man			1
in real life , such life - changing revelations do n't always come			0
i dated a @entity4 - type for years			1
there were superficial similarities , like that they both worked in similar industries ( just decades apart ) and had a knack for always being " on			0
" guys like @entity4 are great at their jobs for a multitude of reasons , but one of them is that they present themselves as calm , collected , and unmoved by the opinions and emotions of others			2
in a business situation this comes across as professional , confident , and reassuring to the client that the task at hand will be accomplished flawlessly			0
in a real - life romantic relationship , the refusal or inability to " turn it off " can be frustrating and painful for the other person involved			1
at the same time , being one of the few who is able to get past the facade feels powerful			0
when you 're in love , having that power only makes you feel even more special			0
the @entity0 : 10 things women do n't understand about men there are reasons why @entity4 's wall is so high and impenetrable			1
knowing those reasons -- or at least some of them -- makes viewers sympathetic to him			0
there 's an abused boy beneath that tough exterior ! a man with secrets so big , he has to hide behind a wall all of the time			2
@entity90 may not know @entity4 's secrets , but they do share a bond he does n't have with other people			1
the women he cheats with ? they do n't know him at all and they do n't have the ability or even the interest in seeing something deeper like @entity23 does			2
they 're not threatening to his persona , but she is			0
these are , of course , just excuses for his bad behavior that should never fly in real life			0
my ex had his own reasons for presenting a facade , for not letting anyone get too close , for acting like a jerk ; some he shared , some i figured out , but all made me want to stay with him			0
the @entity0 : could you get past hearing " i do n't love you anymore ? " i do n't know if my draper-esque ex cheated -- though i suspect he did -- but i do think he broke up with me because i was a threat			2
i saw something deeper that was fragile but wonderful , and i wanted more of it			0
it was enough to make me overlook the shallowness of his outward persona			0
similarly , @entity4 gives viewers plenty to love and root for , like his support of @entity124 , his disinterest in @entity127 's brown - nosing , his delivery of that @entity130 pitch in the first season , and the punch he landed on @entity134 's jaw			1
like @entity137 before him , the behavior that would be massively unacceptable in real life is sometimes dwarfed by his acts of kindness , loyalty , and strength			2
the @entity0 : when did you know it was over ? that 's why i ( and i think lots of other women ) mostly love -- and sometimes hate -- @entity4			1
this season -- which started august 16 -- i 'm sure we 'll see more cracks in @entity4 's facade , and it should be compelling and exciting to watch			1
but in real life , with a real @entity4 , i could only do so much			2
i made as many cracks as i could , but they repaired themselves and i was n't able to get close enough to try again			0
in retrospect , thank @entity157			0
that 's why i 'll give my attention to @entity4 once a week , from the comfort of my couch , but never again in real life			1

columnist *describes* @entity4 of " @entity6 " as *fun* to watch but not date
an inability to " turn it off " in romantic moments is frustrating , columnist says
women who know the deepness of a @entity4 man are a threat , she writes
" @entity6 " *fan* says @entity4 's *misbehavior* is covered up by his kind acts
