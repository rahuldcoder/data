-- the family of @entity2 -- a mother of three - week - old twins who is battling a rare flesh - eating bacteria -- realizes all too well that she " still has a long road ahead " after seven surgeries			1
" we do n't know what the next day is going to bring , so we 're just trusting the @entity10 , " her brother @entity7 said sunday			1
" we 're taking it one day at a time			2
" her twins , @entity13 and @entity14 , are being cared for by family and friends as their mother battles necrotizing fasciitis at @entity18			1
their uncle told reporters from outside the western @entity22 hospital that both babies are " doing great			1
" " they are healthy and doing well , " @entity7 said			2
they were born may 7 in @entity26			2
at that time , @entity2 was healthy but , a few days later , she went to hospital near her @entity22 home after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg , her husband @entity27 , a firefighter , told @entity0 last week			1
since going to the hospital on may 11 , @entity2 has been " intubated and sedated , " her brother said			1
" she does respond sometimes , you can see in her blood pressure			0
she has opened her eyes a little bit at times , " said @entity7 , who has been going back and forth from his sister 's side to his home in western @entity40			0
" but that 's pretty much it			0
" @entity2 's health is precarious , though @entity7 expressed gratitude sunday it appears confined to her legs and has not affected her internal organs			1
that is unlike @entity51 , a 24 - year - old graduate student at the @entity52 suffering from the same disease			0
she has already lost a leg , part of her abdomen , her remaining foot and her hands , according to online posts from her father , @entity60			0
@entity7 also gave thanks sunday for the support that his sister , a paramedic , has gotten from fellow relatives , friends and the community , as well as medical staff			0
he pointed to two efforts in particular -- one by fellow @entity68 called " loops for @entity2 , " selling navy blue and green bracelets , as well as a fundraiser ride by the @entity22 chapter of the @entity74 of the @entity75 -- to raise money for @entity2 and her family			1
" so many people in the community have rallied behind her , and we 're so thankful for that , " @entity7 said			0
the condition that @entity2 and @entity60 are facing , necrotizing fasciitis , is rare			1
dr. @entity86 , chairman of the @entity87 at the @entity88 , estimates that fewer than 250 cases occur each year in the @entity90 , though such estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities			0
caused by a number of bacteria , the disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20 % of the time , according to the @entity100			1
the responsible bacteria are common in the environment , though they rarely cause infections			0
when they do , the body 's immune system is almost always able to fight them off , according to experts			2
occasionally , however , the bacteria find their way into the bloodstream -- either through a cut or an abrasion			0
in such cases , doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain .			2

@entity2 was healthy when she gave birth to twins on may 7 , her family says
she 's been in a @entity22 hospital since may 11 after noticing a bruise on her leg
she is battling necrotizing fasciitis , a rare condition that attacks healthy body tissue
" we do n't know what the next day is going to bring , " her brother says
