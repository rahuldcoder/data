-- it was a rare occurrence : ninth - graders in @entity4 's health class giving something their full attention			2
the students , at @entity10 ' @entity9 , sat at their desks watching a video			1
they were about to learn the sexually transmitted disease status of a @entity15 beauty queen			2
the teenagers laughed as the video instructed them to turn their attention to their cell phones , @entity16 recalls -- normally , it was a constant battle to get them to put the phones away			0
then the video had them text a code to @entity25 , a website that allows kids as young as 13 to find an std clinic , get tested and have their results sent to them via text message			2
moments later , the teens got a text revealing that @entity33 2009 , @entity34 , was negative for @entity35 , gonorrhea and chlamydia			0
@entity37 is the celebrity face of @entity25 's new @entity40 awareness campaign			1
if it 's cool for a beauty queen to share her @entity40 status , then maybe kids will start to think it 's cool to share their own results			1
site founder @entity47 is banking on it			2
" we want to normalize the idea of sharing your status , " @entity47 says			0
high - tech tools to fight @entity40 a text message revealing a teenager 's positive or negative @entity40 status may well be the latest tool -- albeit a controversial one -- to target the spread of disease among students			1
this past fall , @entity25 partnered with the @entity61 -- the second largest school system in the country , with more than 660,000 k - 12 students -- to teach students as young as seventh grade how to get their std results , show them to potential partners , and then request to see their potential partners ' results before they hook up or have sex			1
sexual activity among students has long been a concern for the district			1
in 2005 , the @entity75 surveyed more than 4,000 middle - schoolers in 14 area public schools			0
the research showed 16 % of seventh - graders had engaged in oral sex and 20 % of eighth - graders had had intercourse			0
a 2011 national school - based survey conducted by the @entity85 and @entity10 schools found 39 % of high schoolers were having sex			1
the district turned to @entity25 to try a new approach to get students tested and reduce infections			1
so far , 200,000 ninth - through 12th - graders and 120,000 seventh - and eighth - graders have learned about the free service in fall and spring semester health classes , according to @entity97 , the district 's hiv / aids prevention program manager			2
" we do n't suspect that most seventh - graders are going to go out and use this			0
we do suspect that in high school they will , " @entity97 says			0
critics of the partnership , however , say @entity25 comes too close to condoning underage sex and gives an incomplete picture of someone 's @entity40 status by excluding certain infections , like hpv and herpes			1
" while we absolutely encourage sexually active teens to be tested for @entity40 , the underlying message of the @entity25 campaign is troublesome , " says @entity114 , president and ceo of the @entity116 , a group that " exists to serve , support and represent individuals and organizations in the practice of abstinence education , " according to its website			1
" it provides tacit endorsement of teen sexual activity , sending the message to teens as young as 13 that sexual experimentation is expected and risk - free as long as they are tested for stds and use a condom , " @entity132 says in a statement			1
the @entity10 school district disagrees			1
" we 're not using this as a lure for kids to say , ' ok , you can have sex because you did this , ' " @entity97 says			0
" what we felt was that if the kids had the information that they would make better decisions about their sexual partners			1
" @entity149 approves morning - after pill without prescription for girls 15 and older in 2011 , @entity10 - area youths between 13 and 19 contracted 25 % of chlamydia cases and 16 % of gonorrhea cases , according to the @entity75			2
people under 18 made up 24.1 % of the county 's population in 2011 , according to the @entity159			0
" so many kids are walking around with stds and they do n't even know it , " @entity97 says			0
" we definitely have an epidemic going on			0
" by law , children as young as 12 in @entity15 can get tested for @entity40 without a parent 's consent			1
the district offers testing on some of its campuses , but stigma and logistical challenges , like access to a car , can keep students out of clinics			2
@entity25 requires an @entity40 test			1
if it catches on and students start demanding to see their partner 's verified @entity40 status , sex educators hope it will give teens an incentive to get tested if they want to have sex			1
" one of the things we 're saying is this will make you more attractive to other students potentially , " @entity47 says			2
" then the pressure is on the person who does n't have it , " adds @entity16 , whose own students were split on whether they would actually use @entity25			1
" we had many people saying , ' oh , this program is dope			0
this is cool , ' " says 14 - year - old student @entity200			0
" and we had other people going like , ' i really do n't agree with this program			0
' " @entity200 says he 's not sexually active yet , but some of his friends are			0
he told his mom about @entity25 when he got home from school			2
" she was cool letting me use stuff like this to help keep me in check -- but as long as i stay safe , " he says			1
" as long as i do n't not use protection			0
" critics also question whether students would be organized enough to get themselves to clinics or be mature enough to actually use the information before having sex			1
" i 'm skeptical how often somebody will say , ' hey , if you do n't tell me your test results then we 're not doing it , ' " says @entity218 , a senior fellow for policy studies at the @entity220			0
" to expect a 13 - year - old , or a 15 - or 17 - year - old for that matter , to able to act in such a rational manner while they 're in the grip of these irrational passions is very naive and unrealistic			0
" even more progressive institutions , like @entity234 , express caution			0
" while we value the use of innovative tools to improve sexual health , the most powerful message we can deliver to prevent infections is to always use a condom every time you have sex , " says @entity236 , @entity234 's vice president of education			1
free condoms for your 12 - year - old ? @entity15 health council can help the district says it recognizes parents may be uncomfortable with their children using technology to text and share their @entity40 status , but notes its tech - savvy students have a different perspective			1
" this is how they receive information now			0
this is where they go to -- their phones -- and so for them to receive it that way is n't abnormal			0
it 's normal , " @entity97 says			0
" what we 're doing basically as adults is we 're entering their world , which we 're always trying to do			0
we 're always trying to figure out how do we speak their language -- use our tools , but bridge that with what they 're doing now			0
" @entity4 , who 's already taught @entity277 to about 120 students , says he did it to protect them			2
" it 's just shown to them as a tool , just like a condom is a tool to prevent an @entity40 , " he says			1
" if students are n't getting tested or are n't talking to their partners about @entity40 status , then knowing what gonorrhea is is kind of irrelevant			1
" the district says it 's too soon to know how many students are using @entity25			1
in the future , @entity47 says he 'd like the service to be an educational tool used across the country			0
" we 'll have the best information anywhere in the country for where students -- and anyone who wants to get tested for @entity40 -- can go , " he says			2
" sometimes kids are going to forget to use condoms , sometimes they 're not going to share their status , but if there 's a resource for them to do so , i think it empowers a lot of them who are really concerned about this			2

@entity25 , a site that allows users to share @entity40 status , partners with @entity10 schools
*proponents* say it 's a way for students to stay safe when *choosing* to have sex
critics say it provides " tacit endorsement " for teen sexual activity
the district acknowledges it may make some parents uncomfortable
