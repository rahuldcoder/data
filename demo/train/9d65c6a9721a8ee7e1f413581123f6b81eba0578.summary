-- this world is a busy place with billions of people and billions of things to achieve and experience			2
it 's easy to live a lifetime without knowing the feeling of helping others			1
but can you really blame people for making a way for themselves and not others ? that 's the message you get from birth : " go after your dreams and do n't let anything or anyone keep you from it			1
" i hear people ask : " what 's in it for me ? " or " why should i help you , or them ? " could it be that they were never taught the importance of helping others or know how much they could gain from it themselves ? for me it was n't someone , but more something , that made me realize the importance of helping others			1
it was simply visiting a place that some have never visited before -- and fighting for my life			2
after sustaining burn injuries while serving in the @entity39 in @entity40 in 2003 at 19 years old , i asked myself a notebook full of questions			1
the main one was : " why did this happen to me , and what am i going to do with it ? " as i carried on with my recovery , i waited for that answer			2
about six months after i was burned , i was asked to visit a young man in the same position as me			1
he was in the early stages of his recovery and had n't been as physically injured as i was			1
growing up , i was n't as connected to helping other people because too much was catching my attention , typical teenage things like football and girls			1
needless to say , walking into that young man 's room when i was 20 and visiting him gave me more than any other experience ever gave me			1
it opened my eyes to a true purpose			0
i learned that i was able to have an impact on others and help them avoid the difficulties and challenges i faced in order to learn the many things i have learned			0
i do not regret what happened to me on april 5 , 2003 , because it has brought me to a special place and has given me so much from which to grow			0
i know i have so much more to experience and learn			0
i am living the @entity75 , and that is being able to dream and make it a reality			2
others do not have this opportunity because of a disruptive childhood , abusive relationships or limited resources			0
i went from fighting for my life to helping inspire others to fight for their own			1
i have had the honor of sharing my own life experiences with audiences throughout the world , and it has been a whirlwind			2
however , being able to hear others ' stories and meet people who share the name " hero " with me is even more amazing			0
i had the unbelievable honor to meet great people over the years , and most recently , at the @entity97 show in @entity98			0
i attended the show to support my friend @entity100 , founder of @entity101 , which provides custom - made homes to wounded and disabled veterans and the widows of the fallen in an effort to get their lives back on track and become productive members of their communities			0
he is a hero to many people			0
he did n't know much about the troops , but he knew how to build homes and wanted to give the troops what had been given to him and his family : hope , life , respect , acknowledgement and opportunity			1
witnessing him being honored and also meeting nine other heroes that night motivated me to continue the fight to give to others			0
so , ask yourself this question : will you be someone 's hero ? if you reply yes , but do n't know where to start , do as my friend @entity131 , the executive director and founder of @entity133 , suggests			1
" instead of asking the question , ' what can i can do ? ' the real question is , ' what do you do best ? ' " the more heroes we have , the better off our world will be			0
all of us can have an unimaginable effect on one person with the simple concept of making him or her feel cared for , appreciated and that they matter			1
most important , you will learn far more than you ever expected , and that is what 's in it for you			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			2

@entity152 was *severely* burned while serving as a *soldier* in @entity40 at 19
during recovery , he helped another young man in the same situation , which *changed* his life
people do n't understand that the feeling of helping others is " what 's in it for them "
to start helping others , do what you do best , make them feel appreciated , @entity152 says
