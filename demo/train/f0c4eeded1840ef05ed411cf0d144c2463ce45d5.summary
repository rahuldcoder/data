( @entity4 ) -- are skyrocketing gasoline prices cursing your commute ? wondering why you 're driving to work only to spend your hard - earned dollars to get you there and back ? perhaps telecommuting is the answer			1
telecommuting is changing the way we work			1
an estimated 10 percent of today 's workforce works from home and remains on the company payroll			1
and a recent study commissioned by @entity22 estimates that 2 million @entity24 businesses support some kind of telecommuting program			1
employees who telecommute largely report that they are happier with their jobs and more satisfied with their personal lives			2
a survey by the @entity31 even found that 36 percent of respondents would choose telecommuting over a pay raise			1
increased quality of life sits at the top of the list of employee benefits along with reduced stress levels , greater flexibility and increased productivity			2
and contrary to the popular " out of sight , out of mind " misconception that telecommuting will take you off the fast track , a study of 17,000 telecommuters by the @entity24 @entity47 ( myths and @entity44 ) found that teleworkers receive a higher proportion of promotions than their stay - at - work counterparts			1
employers in turn benefit from reduced real estate costs and absenteeism , increased productivity , morale and employer turnover costs			0
in addition , many find that telecommuting seems to encourage certain entrepreneurial qualities in their employees , including drive , self - discipline , self - reliance and improved judgment			1
there are benefits to the community as well : reduced fossil fuel consumption and traffic congestion which lead to cleaner air and safer neighborhoods			0
according to the @entity82 , if an additional 10 percent of the nation 's workforce would telecommute just one day a week , @entity24 would avoid the frustration of driving 24.4 million miles , breathe air with 13,000 tons less air pollution and conserve more than 1.2 million gallons of fuel each week			1
are you a candidate for telecommuting ? certain jobs such as writers , salespersons , accountants , programmers , graphic artists , researchers , engineers , architects and public relations professionals lend themselves to telecommuting better than others			2
you also need to have the right personal qualities			0
for example , do you have the self - discipline to work from home under minimal supervision ? does your boss perceive you as a self - starter who can work independently ? are you a proven performer ? well - organized ? a good time - manager ? if the answers are yes , you may want to propose a telecommuting arrangement with your employer			1
to do so successfully , follow the same principles you would in a job interview			0
focus on the benefits of telecommuting to the company , not the benefits to you			2
state only that telecommuting will make you more productive and efficient , be a better use of the time you currently spend on the road , make your boss 's life easier -- whatever benefits you come up with that focus on the employer 's needs , not yours			1
outline in writing your job description and assure your boss that you 'll meet your responsibilities			0
emphasize that you know what needs to be done and that telecommuting wo n't significantly change that			2
you may even want to include a table that shows which of your job functions will be accomplished off - site , which will be performed in the traditional workplace and which can be done at either location			0
describe how you will handle key relationships with other team members			0
think about yourself the same way you would if you were looking for a new job			0
what is your unique selling proposition ? how are you an asset to your employer , and what do you do better then anyone else in your company ? by effectively communicating your value to your employer , you 'll be better able to sell your boss on the idea of letting you telework			0
