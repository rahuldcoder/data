in response to an incendiary e-mail that drew criticism from online sites and on - campus organizations alike , a @entity6 student and @entity8 fraternity member has stepped forward and issued an apology in the school 's newspaper			1
the e-mail , which instructed fellow fraternity members on " luring rapebait " and contained several references to using alcohol as a means of sexual persuasion , caught the attention of online communities and prompted @entity6 and @entity8 to issue statements and conduct investigations into the incident			1
the national chapter of the fraternity temporarily suspended the campus chapter			0
the sender , identified as @entity28 , says he was his chapter 's social chair , a position he has since relinquished			0
in the apology , he claims the e-mail was written as a joke , but should never have been written in the first place			2
" @entity38 behavior is everywhere online and unfortunately , my attempt to ridicule it in an immature and outrageous satire backfired terribly and in a manner i mistakenly underestimated , " @entity28 wrote in @entity36 , @entity6 's student newspaper			1
@entity28 explained the origin of the e-mail 's central term , " rapebait , " as a nickname that became an " internal fraternity joke			2
" " in retrospect , it was a nickname i should not have embraced but continuing to use the term was my fault			0
as a leader i should have put a stop to it in any reference , " he wrote			0
" i know i can not fix all the damage i have done , but i will strive to become a better man as i work through this episode in my life , " @entity28 said			1
