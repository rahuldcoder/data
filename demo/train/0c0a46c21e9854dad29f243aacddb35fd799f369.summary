@entity0 , @entity1 -- the residents of zoos are often the first to be neglected when cities are hit by man - made or natural disasters			1
@entity2 senior international correspondent @entity8 discovered a dire situation tuesday at the @entity10 , struggling to function as a nationwide conflict rages around it			1
@entity8 found the gates locked and was told the zoo was under renovation -- that there were no animals there			2
but a big cat 's roar told a different story , and @entity8 followed the sound -- underscored by the echo of gunfire in the distance -- to find enclosures holding a tiger , lions , giant tortoises , hippos , hyenas , bears , monkeys , deer , emus and more			2
all the animals appeared undernourished and struggling as they waited for food and for water where there was little or none to be found			2
a tiger , loose skin hanging on its frame , prowled its enclosure when it sensed visitors			0
" just looking at him , you can see how thin he is in the way he is walking -- those back thighs , they 're so skinny , " @entity8 said of the big cat			0
" there 's no one here to tell us how often they 're being fed or how much they 're getting fed , " @entity8 said as he walked the deserted grounds			1
" we do n't even know if there 's a vet here to take care of them			0
" during the @entity2 visit , the zookeeper arrived and explained that for seven days amid the turmoil of conflict in @entity0 , the animals got nothing			1
now 10 of the 200 - person staff have returned and are trying to feed all the animals			1
the big cats get only half of what they need			0
and all the animals languish with one essential in very short supply			0
" water is these animals ' most pressing need , " @entity8 said			1
" and it seems without help in these sweltering temperatures , all the animals here will continue to suffer			0
