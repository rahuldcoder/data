editor 's note : this is an excerpt from " @entity3 " by @entity4 , a nonfiction account of a @entity8 - @entity7 immigrant and his extraordinary experience during @entity10			1
@entity4 is the author of five other books , including " @entity13 , " a finalist for the 2006 @entity15			1
@entity4 is the founder and editor of @entity18 's , an independent publishing house based in @entity20			1
@entity4 writes that @entity3 dreamed of fishing on the @entity8 coast as @entity10 approached			1
( @entity23 ) -- friday , august 26 , 2005 on moonless nights the men and boys of @entity26 , a dusty fishing town on the coast of @entity8 , would gather their lanterns and set out in their quietest boats			1
five or six small craft , two or three fishermen in each			1
a mile out , they would arrange the boats in a circle on the black sea , drop their nets , and , holding their lanterns over the water , they would approximate the moon			1
the fish , sardines , would begin gathering soon after , a slow mass of silver rising from below			1
the fish were attracted to plankton , and the plankton were attracted to the light			1
they would begin to circle , a chain linked loosely , and over the next hour their numbers would grow			1
the black gaps between silver links would close until the fishermen could see , below , a solid mass of silver spinning			2
@entity3 was only thirteen when he began fishing for sardines this way , a method called lampara , borrowed from the @entity56			1
he had waited years to join the men and teenagers on the night boats , and he 'd spent those years asking questions			2
why only on moonless nights ? because , his brother @entity66 said , on moon - filled nights the plankton would be visible everywhere , spread out all over the sea , and the sardines could see and eat the glowing organisms with ease			2
but without a moon the men could make their own , and could bring the sardines to the surface in stunning concentrations			2
you have to see it , @entity66 told his little brother			2
you 've never seen anything like this			2
and when @entity85 first witnessed the sardines circling in the black he could not believe the sight , the beauty of the undulating silver orb below the white and gold lantern light			2
he said nothing , and the other fishermen were careful to be quiet , too , paddling without motors , lest they scare away the catch			2
they would whisper over the sea , telling jokes and talking about women and girls as they watched the fish rise and spin beneath them			2
a few hours later , once the sardines were ready , tens of thousands of them glistening in the refracted light , the fishermen would cinch the net and haul them in			2
they would motor back to the shore and bring the sardines to the fish broker in the market before dawn			2
he would pay the men and boys , and would then sell the fish all over western @entity8 -- @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118			1
the fishermen would split the money , with @entity85 and @entity66 bringing their share home			2
their father had passed away the year before and their mother was of fragile health and mind , so all funds they earned fishing went toward the welfare of the house they shared with ten siblings			1
@entity85 and @entity66 did n't care much about the money , though			2
they would have done it for free			0
thirty - four years later and thousands of miles west , @entity3 was in bed on a friday morning , slowly leaving the moonless @entity26 night , a tattered memory of it caught in a morning dream			1
he was in his home in @entity144 and beside him he could hear his wife @entity146 breathing , her exhalations not unlike the shushing of water against the hull of a wooden boat			1
otherwise the house was silent			0
he knew it was near six o'clock , and the peace would not last			0
the morning light usually woke the kids once it reached their second - story windows			0
one of the four would open his or her eyes , and from there the movements were brisk , the house quickly growing loud			0
with one child awake , it was impossible to keep the other three in bed			0
@entity146 woke to a thump upstairs , coming from one of the kids ' rooms			0
she listened closely , praying silently for rest			0
each morning there was a delicate period , between six and six - thirty , when there was a chance , however remote , that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep			0
but now there was another thump , and the dog barked , and another thump followed			0
what was happening in this house ? @entity146 looked to her husband			0
he was staring at the ceiling			0
the day had roared to life			0
the phone began ringing , today as always , before their feet hit the floor			0
@entity146 and @entity3 -- most people called him by his last name because they could n't pronounce his first -- ran a company , @entity194 , and every day their crews , their clients , everyone with a phone and their number , seemed to think that once the clock struck six - thirty , it was appropriate to call			1
usually there were so many calls at the stroke of six - thirty that the overlap would send half of them straight to voicemail			0
@entity146 took the first one , from a client across town , while @entity3 shuffled into the shower			1
fridays were always busy , but this one promised madness , given the rough weather on the way			0
there had been rumblings all week about a tropical storm crossing the @entity220 , a chance it might head north			0
though this kind of possibility presented itself every august and did n't raise eyebrows for most , @entity146 and @entity3 's more cautious clients and friends often made preparations			1
throughout the morning the callers would want to know if @entity3 could board up their windows and doors , if he would be clearing his equipment off their property before the winds came			1
workers would want to know if they 'd be expected to come in that day or the next			0
" @entity237 , " @entity146 said , trying to sound alert			0
it was an elderly client , a woman living alone in a @entity241 mansion , asking if @entity3 's crew could come over and board up her windows			1
" sure , of course , " @entity146 said , letting her feet drop heavily to the floor			0
@entity146 was the business 's secretary , bookkeeper , credit department , public - relations manager -- she did everything in the office , while her husband handled the building and painting			0
the two of them balanced each other well : @entity3 's @entity257 had its limits , so when bills had to be negotiated , hearing @entity146 's @entity261 drawl put clients at ease			1
this was part of the job , helping clients prepare their homes for coming winds			0
@entity146 had n't given much thought to the storm this client was talking about			1
it took a lot more than a few downed trees in south @entity220 to get her attention			0
" we 'll have a crew over this afternoon , " @entity146 told the woman			0
@entity146 and @entity3 had been married for eleven years			1
@entity3 had come to @entity144 in 1994 , by way of @entity281 and @entity282 and a half - dozen other @entity7 cities he 'd explored as a young man			1
@entity146 had grown up in @entity282 and was used to the hurricane routine : the litany of preparations , the waiting and watching , the power outages , the candles and flashlights and buckets catching rain			0
there seemed to be a half - dozen named storms every august , and they were rarely worth the trouble			0
this one , named @entity10 , would be no different .			1

@entity4 : @entity3 grew up in a @entity8 fishing town
he says @entity3 *emigrated* to @entity7 and *settled* in @entity144
@entity3 and his family thought little of @entity10 as it approached the @entity304
