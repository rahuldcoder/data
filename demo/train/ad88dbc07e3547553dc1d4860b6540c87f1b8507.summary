-- an @entity2 death row inmate who has repeatedly claimed his innocence was spared execution , after the state 's governor thursday noted " legitimate questions " about evidence used to convict the man			1
@entity10 for now will spend the rest of his life in prison without parole			1
his legal appeals will continue , with lawyers claiming newly discovered evidence and discredited eyewitness testimony will ultimately exonerate him			2
@entity10 was convicted of the 1994 killings of three females , including a child , in an apartment in @entity23 , 60 miles north of @entity24			1
he was scheduled to die by lethal injection september 15 , and had exhausted most of his federal and state court appeals			1
gov. @entity27 , a @entity28 , issued his commutation this week after a number of civil liberties and innocence groups urged he step in to prevent a possibly innocent man from being executed by the state			0
" clearly , the careful exercise of a governor 's executive clemency authority is appropriate in a case like this one , given the real and unanswered questions surrounding the murders for which mr. @entity10 was convicted , " said @entity27 in a statement			1
" mr. @entity10 still has appellate legal proceedings pending which , in theory , could ultimately result in his conviction being overturned altogether			1
the governor added , however , that he believes " it is far more likely that mr. @entity10 committed these murders than it is likely that he did not			1
" @entity27 urged the courts to give a " full , fair analysis " of the issues raised in the appeal			0
he ignored the recommendations of the state 's parole board , which last month unanimously recommended against clemency			1
@entity10 's lawyers applauded the governor 's decision , but promised to continue the fight to clear the inmate			1
" mr. @entity10 remains incarcerated for a crime he did not commit , and that crime remains unsolved , " said a statement from his five - person legal team			2
" the commutation to a life sentence does not lessen the need for justice to prevail			2
" prosecutors said the 46 - year - old @entity10 had maliciously sprayed a home with gunfire , that left a 4 - year - old dead , along with her mother and aunt			2
three others were wounded but survived , including a man who later testified against the main suspect			0
at trial , the state argued one of the victims was the brother of an undercover police informant who had implicated @entity10 as a drug dealer			2
but @entity10 's public defenders point to at least one other suspect , and say a detective in the case lied on the stand about how a survivor of the shooting identified @entity10			1
his defense team also later presented alibi witnesses			0
calls to the @entity97 prosecuting attorney 's office were not immediately returned			2
the issue of " actual innocence " and the rights of prisoners to challenge their sentences years after a trial will be argued next month at the @entity107 @entity106			0
a @entity109 death row inmate wants dna testing from evidence that had not been analyzed at the time of his trial , to try to prove he did not commit the crime			0
the @entity117 , a @entity119 - based legal clinic said 258 people have been exonerated through dna testing and new evidence being uncovered , with their convictions being tossed out			0
many defense attorneys have urged the courts to make it easier for inmates -- especially those facing execution -- to go to court to press for a new look at these innocence claims , including more sophisticated dna testing of old evidence			0
" it 's a win - win for the justice system			0
if he turns out to be guilty , we have the certainty of that fact with objective @entity132 science prior to the time that we carry out the ultimate punishment , " said @entity136 , a staff attorney with the @entity117			0
" and if he 's not guilty , obviously that 's something that we , and surely the state , would want to know prior to the time that an irrevocable penalty of execution is carried out			0

@entity10 was scheduled to die by lethal injection in two weeks
@entity2 's governor *changed* the sentence to life in prison without parole for three killings
the governor cites " legitimate questions " about evidence in the case
but the governor adds he thinks it is " far more likely " than not that @entity10 committed the killings
