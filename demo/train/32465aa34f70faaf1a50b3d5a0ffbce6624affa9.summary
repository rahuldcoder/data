" i think at first it was a pretty inspiring sight , " he said of the protesters			0

but when the police action began , it was a pretty unnerving sight			2
just to see that energy turn into panic and anger was unsettling			0

@entity15 and @entity75 are two of many cities worldwide dealing with the @entity5 protests , the leaderless movement that started in @entity183 in september			1
next round of protests to be closely watched demonstrators have typically railed against what they describe as corporate greed , arrogance and power , as well as repeatedly stated their assertion that the nation 's wealthiest 1 % hold inordinate sway over the remaining 99 % of the population			0
meanwhile , @entity5 expanded its message to include a call for better health care for the " 99 percent , " marching to a shuttered @entity199 hospital slated to become high - end condominiums			0
several hundred protesters from @entity202 spent their afternoon connecting their message to the health care debate , converging on the offices of @entity206 , rallying with doctors and nurses , before heading to the site of the former @entity210			0
