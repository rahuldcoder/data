-- it 's his first trip to @entity3 , one that many doubted would happen at all			0
president @entity6 's five - day tour to @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 happens as a nuclear and humanitarian crisis unfolds in @entity12 after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the island			1
and a civil war rages on in @entity17 , threatening stability in the @entity19			2
the @entity20 is getting involved in a third conflict in the region in addition to @entity24 and @entity25			0
that 's why many speculated that @entity6 would either cancel or postpone his @entity29 trip			1
in his weekly internet and radio address , @entity6 spoke about the reasons why he 's looking south			0
" as we respond to these immediate crises abroad , we also will not let up in our effort to tackle the pressing , ongoing challenges facing our country , including accelerating economic growth , " he said as he made the case for economic opportunities for @entity20 businesses in @entity29			1
analysts say the @entity20 ca n't afford to ignore @entity29 in spite of the challenges in @entity45 and the @entity19			1
@entity46 , not the @entity20 , is now the largest destination for @entity7 exports			1
and former @entity7 president @entity49 defied most countries on the @entity51 last year ( and certainly the @entity20 ) on the issue of sanctions against @entity54 for its nuclear program			1
in recent years , @entity7 has discovered oil reserves off the coast of @entity58 that could be the largest in the world if the estimates of @entity61 ( the state - owned @entity7 oil company ) are right			0
add to that the fact that @entity7 is hosting the @entity64 in 2014 and the @entity65 in 2016 , and it becomes a logical choice for a country to be visited by an @entity29 president			1
that 's why @entity70 , director of the @entity29 program at the @entity72 in @entity73 , calls @entity7 " the obvious country on the itinerary			1
" she said @entity7 " is , depending on whose numbers you use , anywhere from the fifth to the eighth economy in the world			0
it is a global player on issues like climate change , environmental preservation , innovation and biofuels development			0
it 's also seeking a permanent seat on the @entity90 @entity51			0
" @entity8 , considered an economic @entity29 success , will be @entity6 's second stop			1
a devastating earthquake that hit the country in february of last year had little effect , if any , on its booming economy			0
gross domestic product grew more than 5 % in 2010 , in spite of the catastrophic 8.8 - magnitude temblor , one of the 10 most powerful earthquakes on record			0
@entity8 signed a free trade agreement with the @entity20 on january 1 , 2004 , and its government claims to have more such agreements than any other country in the world , with pacts signed with the @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity46 , @entity111 , @entity112 , and @entity113			1
( @entity110 , or the @entity110 , is an economic agreement that promotes free trade among @entity116 , @entity7 , @entity117 and @entity118			2
) with a mixture of open market policies and strong economic institutions , @entity8 has dramatically reduced poverty			2
only 18.2 % of the population lived below the poverty line in 2009 , compared with nearly 40 % 20 years ago			0
" the center - right government of [ president ] @entity126 has by no means done away with the social programs put in place under the @entity130 [ a coalition of center - left political parties ] that were so successful in reducing poverty in @entity8 , " @entity70 said			2
@entity9 , @entity6 's third stop of the tour , is also a success story , although on a much lesser scale			1
@entity70 says that in a relatively short period of time , the @entity140 country has managed to professionalize and downsize its army and establish a system of political competition in which everyone agrees on the rules of the game ( a great achievement when one takes into account that @entity9 was ravaged by a civil war that lasted from 1979 to 1992 )			1
" they are not the only success stories , but they 're very important success stories in all three countries			0
@entity9 came out of civil war , @entity7 and @entity8 came out of decades of military dictatorship , and there 's been significant progress in all three countries in moving away from that past , " @entity70 said			1
for @entity161 , a senior fellow at the @entity162 in @entity73 , @entity9 is important for the @entity163 for other reasons as well			0
" in @entity9 converge in a very clear way three issues that are crucial when it comes to the relation between the @entity20 and @entity29 countries : migration , trade and security , " @entity161 said			1
more than 2.5 million @entity9 live in the @entity20 , and the government of president @entity175 wants a resolution on their immigration status			2
as @entity113 has scored important victories against major drug cartels , these criminal organizations have moved into @entity140 countries , including @entity9			2
according to @entity161 , @entity9 is looking for a closer partnership with the @entity20 to increase its security			2
" so far , the @entity20 government has earmarked $ 100 million [ to boost security ] for fiscal year 2011 , which is quite limited			0
this amount of money for the @entity140 region is minuscule , compared to the magnitude of the drug trafficking problem they face , " @entity161 said .			0

analysts say the @entity20 ca n't afford to ignore @entity29 despite those challenges
