who stole the show on @entity11 of the @entity4 convention			2
wednesday 's session began amid controversy over language in the party 's platform that saw a tumultuous voice vote			1
it 's not the image @entity4 wanted to project after a successful opening night			2
and while @entity8 's speech was 15 minutes longer than his famously panned 1988 convention address , this one kept the audience in the packed @entity26 on its feet			1
here are five things we learned from wednesday night : 1			2
@entity8 delivers forty eight minutes , more or less			1
that 's how long @entity8 's speech lasted on wednesday night , but no one in @entity32 gave a rip			1
why ? the @entity33 showed up wednesday with a combative , charming and substantive piece of oratory that many in the political class immediately billed as one of the best speeches he has ever delivered			1
@entity8 's remarks at the @entity41 and crucially , president @entity42 -- who has struggled to explain his policy accomplishments to the public -- got a tremendous boost from the best communicator in @entity48 politics			1
republicans were stunned after the speech			2
" tonight , when everybody leaves , lock the door , " @entity52 strategist @entity51 said on @entity0 immediately after the speech ended			1
" you do n't have to come back tomorrow			2
this will be the moment that probably re-elected @entity42			2
@entity8 saved the @entity4 once			1
it was going too far left			0
he came in and took it to the center			0
he did it again tonight			0
" @entity64 , another leading @entity52 operative , tweeted his praise			1
" highly effective @entity8 speech			1
aimed right at voters @entity42 needs , " @entity64 wrote			0
and then : " a master 's class in using ( select ) factoids and policy ideas to ' explain ' and score big politically			1
@entity73 's speech should have done this			2
" forget that @entity8 strayed from his prepared remarks repeatedly and was not even halfway through his speech when the clock struck 11 p.m. on the @entity78 -- the @entity8 delivered			1
now it 's @entity42 's turn			2
@entity8 answers the burning question republicans criticized @entity4 this week for largely avoiding a firm answer on the question of whether @entity48 are better off than they were four years ago			1
it was a question that first gained traction last week during @entity87 's acceptance speech , when he said , " you know there 's something wrong with the kind of job he 's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him			1
" @entity8 says @entity42 offers a better path forward for @entity48 and the issue further snowballed when @entity4 gov. @entity100 of @entity101 answered " no " to the query during a sunday interview -- a reply quickly seized upon by @entity52			1
while speakers at the @entity41 tuesday and wednesday mostly stayed away from the topic , @entity8 answered it head - on in his speech , delivering perhaps his biggest moment of the night			1
" he inherited a deeply damaged economy			0
he put a floor under the crash			0
he began the long , hard road to recovery and laid the foundation for a modern , more well - balanced economy , " he said			0
he continued : " now are we where we want to be today ? no. is the president satisfied ? of course not			0
but are we better off than when we were when he took office ? listen to me , " he said , as the crowd roared			0
he then painted a picture of economic conditions at the time @entity42 took office in january 2009 , saying 750,000 jobs were disappearing per month and adding the economy was " in free fall			2
" " are we doing better than today ? the answer -- yes , " he said forcefully			0
he used the " better off " theme several more times through the night			0
inside the @entity41 : sights and sounds from convention - goers @entity8 rallied the crowd , urging them of the importance of re-electing @entity42 to finish what he described as a tough ride from the start			1
" no president -- not me , not any of my predecessors -- no one could have fully repaired all the damage he found in just four years , " he said			2
foreign policy and faith still matter what goes around , comes around			1
one week after criticizing the platform that @entity52 approved at their convention last week , @entity4 got a taste of their own medicine on @entity11 of their convention			1
while tuesday 's session was considered a strong opener , there was a growing controversy over the omission in the current platform of a line from the 2008 platform that recognized @entity163 as the capital of @entity165			1
republicans and @entity87 presidential campaign officials quickly pounced			0
fast forward a day : the wednesday session started with some dissension when delegates approved a change in the party platform to reinstate the 2008 line			1
another change restored the word " @entity176 " to the platform after the 2012 version omitted it , though it included language on faith as part of @entity48 society			1
the language referring to @entity176 - given rights was the same as in the 2008 platform			1
just in : @entity4 update platform with @entity163 , @entity176 reference but it took three voice votes to pass the changes , with supporters and opponents loudly expressing their sentiments			1
when @entity195 mayor @entity194 , chairman of the convention , said that the motion passed with a two - thirds majority , some delegates made it clear they were n't happy			0
@entity42 himself intervened regarding the @entity163 language , a senior @entity4 source told @entity0			1
and @entity4 say that illustrates that the president showed leadership			2
but the damage was done			0
@entity87 campaign spokeswoman @entity208 was quick to put out a statement saying " @entity87 has consistently stated his belief that @entity163 is the capital of @entity165			1
" analysts said it was a terrible start to the second day			0
" after a roaring first night that we all proclaimed was successful , they started out wednesday night with a stumble , " said @entity0 senior political analyst @entity214 , who has advised @entity4 and @entity52 presidents			1
@entity219 , a @entity0 contributor and former @entity42 administration special adviser , called it a " big blunder			0
" " i think it was handled badly from beginning to end , and now i think we 're going to pay a price for it , " he said			0
@entity0 chief national correspondent @entity229 said the conversation should have never come up			0
" the @entity4 last week decided to make a very big deal of the @entity52 platform			1
when you do that , it is @entity236 , you better scrub yours , because you know this is coming , " he said			0
we , not me the theme of convention week is " americans coming together " -- and for the second night in a row , @entity4 hammered the premise home with a clarion call for collectivism instead of individualism			0
this is n't a big shocker			0
those two worldviews are at the heart of the ideological schism between the @entity4 and @entity52			1
but in speech after speech about the slowly recovering economy , @entity4 aggressively pushed a common message : we 're all in this together			0
five lines that killed on @entity264 " democrats believe in reigniting the @entity48 dream by removing barriers to success and building ladders of opportunity for all , so everyone can succeed , " @entity266 minority leader @entity265 announced			0
" @entity276 belongs to all of us , " said @entity275 attorney general @entity274			0
then there was the hook of @entity282 gov. @entity281 's speech about how he started a successful chain of @entity285 brewpubs from next to nothing			2
" it was ' we , ' not ' me , ' " @entity281 said over and over again			0
the contrast at work here ? @entity52 look out for themselves , while @entity4 look out for each other			2
it takes a village and all that			0
if you did n't have that message drilled into your brain at the end of the night , you probably missed that middle school @entity300 class lesson about " context clues			0
" or you were watching the @entity305 - @entity304 game ? 5			0
@entity307 a bigger thorn in @entity87 's side than @entity309 ? @entity87 faced a tsunami of attacks this summer over his business background and former private equity firm , @entity309			1
a pro-obama super pac particularly hammered @entity87 , spending $ 20 million on commercials in crucial swing states painting @entity87 as a greedy corporate raider			0
and while speakers addressed @entity309 during prime time , @entity4 seemed to be more fired up about another target wednesday night : his running mate			2
fact or fiction ? @entity307 's @entity324 speech speech after speech dealt several zings at rep. @entity307 's budget plan , a proposal widely backed by the @entity52 and one that favors tax cuts coupled with large entitlement cuts			1
sister @entity331 especially hammered home the point			0
the nun has led other nuns on a nine - state bus tour this summer , campaigning against @entity307 's plan as a measure that stands in the way of the church 's moral teachings			1
" @entity87 and @entity307 are correct when they say that each individual should be responsible			2
but their budget goes astray in not acknowledging that we are responsible not only for ourselves and our immediate families , " she said			2
" rather , our faith strongly affirms that we are all responsible for one another			0
" her comments were carried further by @entity48 rep. @entity352 of @entity101 , who serves on the same @entity353 chaired by @entity307			2
@entity352 , who 's been tapped to play the role of @entity307 in debate prep for vice president @entity356 , said @entity87 and @entity307 's " obsession with tax breaks for the wealthy is part of a rigid ideology			1
" " but this theory crashed in the real world			0
we all lived through the recession when jobs went down and the deficit went up , " he said			0
" so when they say they 'll turn around the economy , beware			0
they mean a u-turn back to this failed theory that lifted the yachts while other boats ran aground			0
" wednesday night 's program certainly highlighted @entity87 's time at @entity309 , especially when three laid - off workers took the stage to blast the @entity52 nominee as a heartless businessman motivated only by profit			1
but a stronger theme threaded throughout the night could be found in @entity307 's sweeping budget proposals and @entity4 ' fervent opposition to it			1
political observers say @entity87 's pick in @entity307 was risky , given the congressman 's highly polarizing policy proposals			1
watching the convention this week , it seems those attacks fuel plenty of fire against @entity87 , one that may not die down anytime soon			0
@entity42 to speak after forceful @entity8 endorsement			2

the @entity33 showed up wednesday with combative and charming oratory
@entity8 answered the question , " are you better off than you were four years ago ? "
platform battle over @entity163 and @entity176 show foreign policy and religion matter
@entity307 's budget plan may cause @entity52 problems headed into the fall
