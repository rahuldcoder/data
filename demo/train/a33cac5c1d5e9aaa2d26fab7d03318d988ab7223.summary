-- three former @entity2 officials -- including ex-president @entity3 -- have been charged with conspiring to cover up years of sexual abuse against children by former football coach @entity6			1
@entity3 , along with former athletic director @entity9 and @entity11 president @entity10 , each face the same eight counts related to the @entity6 scandal , including perjury , conspiracy and endangering the welfare of children , @entity8 attorney general @entity7 announced thursday			1
@entity9 and @entity19 are scheduled for a preliminary arraignment at magisterial district judge @entity22 's office at 2 p.m. on friday , and @entity3 's preliminary arraignment is slated for next wednesday at 9:30 a.m. at the same judge 's office , according to a @entity8 courts spokesman @entity26			1
each of the three men is expected to attend his arraignment , said @entity26			0
this is the first time @entity3 has been charged in the wake of the scandal , which started unfolding publicly a year ago			1
@entity9 and @entity19 previously had been charged with perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse			0
the three men " essentially turned a blind eye to serial predatory acts " by @entity6 , @entity7 told a news conference in @entity36 , @entity8			1
@entity6 proclaims his innocence in jailhouse audio recording " this was not a mistake by these men			2
it was not an oversight			0
it was not misjudgment on their part			0
this was a conspiracy of silence by top officials working to actively conceal the truth , with total disregard for the children who were @entity6 's victims in this case , " she said			1
@entity3 's attorneys said " there is no factual basis to support these charges " and accused @entity7 of acting as a pawn for @entity8 gov. @entity63 , who they said " has made no secret of his personal hostility toward dr. @entity3			1
" " these charges are the work of a vindictive and politically motivated governor working through an unelected attorney general , @entity7 , whom he appointed to do his bidding and who will be a lame duck five days from now , " according to a statement from the attorneys			1
they also accused @entity7 and her staff of " steadfastly " refusing to meet with @entity3 or his legal representatives " despite repeated attempts to do so			2
" gov. @entity63 's spokesman @entity81 responded , " @entity3 's statement is the ranting of a man who has just been indicted for covering up for a convicted pedophile			1
his arrogance reveals a man who has just found out that he is not above the law after all			0
" as a result of the charges , @entity2 said @entity3 -- who was removed as president in november 2011 -- will be placed on immediate leave			1
he had continued to serve as a tenured professor , although he was on a sabbatical			0
attorneys blast @entity97 report as @entity3 speaks out @entity2 said it recently informed @entity9 that his fixed - term contract will not be renewed when it expires in june			1
@entity19 had retired after he was initially charged last year			0
the university refused to comment on the charges " out of respect for the legal process			0
" @entity9 's attorney @entity105 said prosecutors did n't give her team any advance notice of the new charges			1
" to be clear , @entity9 is innocent of all charges , " @entity110 said in a statement			0
" we are carefully reviewing the presentment and will reserve a more comprehensive comment for a later time			0
" @entity110 filed a pre-trial motion wednesday , asking to dismiss or suppress @entity9 's grand jury testimony			0
the motion alleges a conflict of interest because the woman @entity9 believed was representing him at the time , was actually representing @entity2			2
@entity0 has reached out to @entity19 's attorney @entity123 , who previously said @entity19 is innocent of the initial charges and he would fight to clear @entity19 's name			1
@entity6 , 68 , was convicted in june on 45 counts of child sex abuse , ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse , which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less - than - two - week trial			2
last month , he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison , meaning he 'll likely die behind bars			2
speaking thursday , @entity7 cited as evidence a series of e-mails among @entity3 , @entity19 , and @entity9 from february 2001 , referring , somewhat in code , to the infamous incident in which assistant coach @entity143 walked in on @entity6 sexually assaulting a young boy in a university shower room			1
@entity0 first reported in june about the allegedly incriminating e-mails			0
ousted @entity2 president says he was abused as a child in july , in a 267 - page report commissioned by the university , former fbi director @entity97 blamed the three men and legendary former head football coach @entity152 for having " never demonstrated ... any concern for the safety and well - being of @entity6 's victims until after @entity6 's arrest , " while the board of trustees failed to perform its oversight duties			1
@entity152 died on january 22			0
" i 'm not going to speculate or comment on mr. @entity152 's relationship to this investigation , " @entity7 said thursday			0
" he 's deceased , and that 's the end of it			0
" in an august interview published in the @entity166 magazine , @entity3 ripped the @entity97 report			2
" it 's unfair , it 's deeply flawed , it has many errors and omissions , " the former university president told @entity169 , a staff writer for @entity166 and @entity0 senior legal analyst			2
" they interviewed , they say , over 430 people ; many of those folks have spoken to me about their interviews			0
many of them describe those interviews to me as a witch hunt			0
" @entity9 and @entity19 are scheduled for a january trial on the initial two charges			0
@entity7 said she thinks now that @entity3 has been charged , the three men should face a joint trial , because of the intertwined nature of the charges			1
in july , the @entity194 vacated @entity2 's football wins dating back to 1998 , the year when allegations that @entity6 was abusing children were first made			1
that penalty removed @entity152 from the top of the list of @entity201 college football 's winningest coaches			0
@entity6 , @entity152 's top defensive assistant for more than two decades , has been placed in protective custody at the @entity203 at @entity204 in @entity205 , where he 'll serve out his sentence for sexually abusing boys			1
@entity2 review recasts story of football hero @entity152 " given the high - profile nature of this individual , coupled with the nature of his crimes , this makes him very vulnerable in a prison setting , " corrections secretary @entity210 said			1
he was transferred to the state prison wednesday from the @entity203 at @entity218 , where he was physically and mentally evaluated			0
in the 1,800 - inmate prison in @entity205 , the former coach is being held in a single cell and has additional supervision and an escort when he 's out of his cell for the three showers and five hours of exercise he is allotted weekly			2
all meals and any counseling or medical visits will take place in @entity6 's cell , according to a statement from the state 's @entity233			1
all visits will be " noncontact , " the statement said			0
@entity6 will be allowed to have a television , radio and other personal property as authorized by prison officials			2
jurors determined that @entity6 , who retired from @entity2 in 1999 , used his access to university facilities and his foundation for underprivileged youths to abuse the boys sexually			1
during the trial , a 23 - year - old man identified as @entity248 testified that he was 13 when @entity6 sexually abused him in a university shower			2
@entity6 is appealing his conviction			2
@entity0 's @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 contributed to this report			0
