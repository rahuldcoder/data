@entity0 , @entity1 -- for years , @entity3 has been pumping billions of dollars across @entity4 to build large - scale infrastructure projects and grant cheap loans in exchange for access to the continent 's natural resources and growing markets			1
and lately , along with its economic and political engagements , @entity12 has also been making significant strides in expanding its media engagements in @entity4			0
in january , the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , a state - owned news behemoth with bureaus all over the world , chose the @entity1 capital of @entity0 as the location of its first broadcast hub outside its @entity12 headquarters			1
analysts say it 's all part of efforts to win the hearts and minds of people in the continent and create a more fertile business environment			2
" @entity16 's expansion in @entity4 is mainly one step of this whole national engine into @entity4 , " says analyst @entity32 of @entity33			1
" @entity3 's investment in @entity4 has increased several folds in the last several years and the trade between @entity3 and the whole continent has reached $ 166 billion , so @entity3 really has a very significant show up at this continent			2
" read related : is the @entity43 losing out to @entity3 in @entity4 ? over the last decade , @entity3 , @entity4 's largest trade partner , has quietly invested significant sums in building communications infrastructure across @entity4 , providing technical upgrades for state broadcasters and training journalists from across the continent			1
at the same time it has been rapidly expanding its presence on the continent 's media landscape			2
@entity54 , @entity3 's state - run news agency , is leading @entity12 's inroads with more than 20 bureaus in the continent			1
in 2008 , it launched the @entity58 while in april last year it teamed up with telecommunications firm @entity59 to start a mobile newspaper in @entity1			0
and now , @entity3 's media strategy in @entity4 has taken a step further by providing customer - oriented news offerings and poaching some of the best journalistic talents to bring @entity4 news to the continent and to the world			1
@entity68 , the @entity1 anchor of @entity16 's flagship show " @entity70 , " says the mission of his program is to change the narrative about @entity4			1
" of course , it goes without saying , it 's war , it is about hunger , we have all of that , yes , but tilt the scale and if you can show the potential and the solution to these and not just point out blatantly the bad side , the problems , the crises that we have , " he says from the state - of - the - art cctv studios in @entity0			1

" we have the news of what is happening in @entity4			0
we tell a positive story of @entity4 people , " he says			1
but analysts say that @entity16 's expansion in @entity4 is a way for @entity12 to change the narrative of @entity3 's involvement in @entity4 from one of exploitation to one of opportunity -- @entity3 's deepening engagement with @entity4 is often portrayed as pillaging the resource - rich continent , giving very little in return			1
for @entity113 , a researcher at the @entity114 , the efforts by the @entity3 state - owned media to increase their influence in @entity4 and other parts of the developing world are part of a bigger soft power drive			1
such initiatives , she says , are aimed at building a positive image in areas where @entity12 is economically and politically active			0
" @entity3 is actively introducing its culture and values , and distributing favorable images through its media to achieve its goals of reducing fears of its military strength , developing closer relations with developing nations and expanding its international influence , " @entity113 wrote in " the rise of @entity3 's @entity125 " paper , published in june			0

" there 's no doubt that a @entity1 office being set up shows a lot about @entity3 's interest to also spread its own voice around the world to maybe counter what the @entity154 media has promoted about @entity3 , " says @entity32			2
but for that voice to be heard , @entity16 's journalists know that they need credibility			2
@entity91 acknowledges that " cctv is media by the @entity3 government " but says that says that there is no censorship from @entity12			0
he points to the broadcaster 's editorial board , which is dominated by @entity1 who make most of the decisions on the coverage			0

" i still believe the state will play a large role in selecting what information will be shown on tv , " he says			0
" it has been done in @entity3 for a long time			0
" for @entity68 , it is a given that he ca n't say anything that is damning to the @entity3 government			0
but the @entity16 anchor is quick to point out that at his previous @entity1 employer , certain subjects were also off - limits			2
he says that @entity16 's expansion is a pioneering project worth standing up to			2
" in the bid to compete with the other big headers and big shots in the international sphere , they have to also go as far as the others are going			0
of course , there are limits , yes			0
and i made amends with that			0
