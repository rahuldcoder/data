-- now that 33 miners who have been trapped in the earth for 19 days have been found alive , the focus is shifting to their physical and mental health as they face a potentially long period before being rescued			1
@entity5 is calling on experts from space and sea to consult on how to maintain the psychological well - being of a group of men crammed into a small space			1
experts from @entity15 and @entity5 navy submarine experts have been called to help , mining minister @entity13 said tuesday			1
the miners have been trapped inside the @entity19 copper and gold mine since an august 5 cave - in			1
a probe over the weekend reached the miners , who survived inside a shelter some 2,300 feet underground			1
officials have estimated that it could take three to four months to reach the miners			1
so far , authorities have spoken with the miners via microphone , but have not disclosed to them their lengthy prediction for a rescue			1
" we have still not told them the timetable , but we are sure that as miners , they know this will take a long time , " health minister @entity33 said			1
as it is , relief such as food and nutrients will also be reaching the miners in small amounts			1
@entity33 said that the miners will likely not be given solid food for five days			1
instead , authorities will send down fluids , liquid proteins and liquid vitamins			2
the strategy is a precaution , @entity33 said , as doctors do not know the exact health of the miners			1
so far , however , the diagnosis looks good , he said			2
none of the men suffered major injuries , though some have minor injuries , @entity33 said			0
some of the miners reported eye irritation from the dust			2
health officials are designing an exercise program and light work to keep the trapped miners physically and mentally active , @entity33 said			1
on monday , the trapped workers cheered , applauded and sang the country 's national anthem in their first verbal contact with officials			0
several of @entity5 's top officials gathered around a white telephone outside the mine as the miners ' voices crackled through the speakers in an emotional conversation that was also broadcast on television			1
" we are listening all of us , strong and clear			0
who 's speaking ? ... how are you doing ? " said @entity13 , according to @entity85			0
@entity87 responded : " we are well and hoping that you will rescue us			2
" the miners cheered as officials informed them that their family members had been keeping vigil outside the mine , @entity85 reported			1
the @entity19 mine is near the town of @entity95 , in the @entity96 in northern @entity5			1
" yesterday , all of @entity5 celebrated in all the plazas of the country that we had made contact with you			1
today they are going to be even happier that we have spoken , " @entity13 said			0
the miners survived for more than 17 days by sharing small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in a shelter , along with water , president @entity104 told @entity0 en @entity111 on monday			2
" they had very little food , " he said			0
" they told us they ate tuna and mackerel every other day , and that they shared ... a jar of peaches among the 33			0
" the area where the miners find themselves is about 50 square meters ( 538 square feet ) , @entity104 said			2
he described the shelter as a type of cavern where they had access to an area called the " workshop , " where they found batteries for light and water for consumption			0
@entity104 estimated the temperatures where the miners are hover between 32 - 35 degrees @entity137 ( 90 - 95 degrees @entity138 )			2
" they 've got the immediate problem of getting supplies and food to these individuals who have been trapped for 18 days now			2
... they 've got to satisfy their basic needs , " he said			0
" then , they 've got the secondary problem , longer - term problem , of drilling down a 28 - inch , 30 - inch hole and getting it down 2,500 feet in very unstable rock conditions			0
and to do that , in order to make it successful , they have got to go slow			0
and that 's the problem , is that despite the fact that everybody wants to rush , the fact is they have to use a slow drill in order to try to stabilize and get stable the hole so that they can , in fact , pull people out from that entrapment underground , " @entity156 said			0
@entity156 told " @entity172 " the mental and emotional components of the miners ' entrapment may be difficult to overcome			1
" how do you come up with things for them to do and arrange things so that they can get their attention diverted from just sitting there waiting ? that 's going to be the real challenge for the @entity5 and for the rescuers , " he said			1
" i think the fact that they 've made it these 18 days is very , very positive			0
but the euphoria of making contact with the surface is going to last a couple days and then it is going to be a long slope			0
" @entity156 added that the @entity5 government and counselors were helping the " resilient " miners , but modern technology could be the biggest boon to the caged miners ' mental health			1
" i see no reason why you could n't pass cellphones down to them or computers , tethered down to them			0
we 're in a new day			0
there 'll need to be -- something will need to be done to divert their attention , " he said			0
@entity5 's mining minister reiterated monday that those responsible for the cave - in will be prosecuted , a point also made a few minutes later at a separate event by the @entity5 president			1
" we will investigate and punish those who are responsible , " @entity104 said			0
family members had cheered sunday when @entity104 held up a handwritten note pulled from the mine			2
the note was tied to a probe authorities had lowered earlier sunday			2
written in @entity111 in red ink , it said simply : " we are fine in the shelter , the 33 of us			0
" @entity0 's @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
