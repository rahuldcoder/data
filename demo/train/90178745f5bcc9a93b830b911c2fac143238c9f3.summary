-- @entity2 's stand off with @entity3 might be spilling over into the sporting arena with the idea floated for @entity7 's team to be barred from contesting june 's @entity8 , but the @entity10 president believes this would be a travesty for the players who worked so hard to qualify for the finals in @entity13			1
@entity3 officials and @entity16 diplomats accuse @entity2 of sending thousands of troops into the @entity19 region in the past week -- a claim @entity2 has denied			1
earlier this week , an unnamed @entity22 official was reported to have told a @entity24 journalist that his organization may try to expel @entity2 from the 2014 finals			2
" i do n't know why 11 players would not be allowed to play at the @entity8			2
where is their responsibility ? " @entity31 told @entity0			2
" why do n't you ( shut down ) the @entity33 ? embassies are still in the country			0
" @entity31 might now be an administrator , but he speaks from personal experience of how politics is never far away from sport			2
the former @entity40 international had a similar decision to make when considering whether to contest the 1978 @entity8 or not			1
there were calls from various quarters to boycott the finals because of the repressive measures being undertaken by the military junta , which took charge in a coup in march 1976 and would rule until 1983			0
one of the most infamous periods in @entity52 's history followed , as thousands of individuals -- primarily with left wing leanings -- disappeared during the ' @entity55 '			0
as the @entity57 nation prepared to host its only @entity8 to date , calls for a potential boycott were led by the @entity59 whose team -- perhaps ironically -- would not just attend the event but reach the final as well			1
@entity64 was also a prominent campaigner as was a group in @entity40 called @entity67 , the @entity69 acronym for the ' @entity70 of the @entity8 in @entity52 ' , who wanted the competition scrapped altogether			1
despite the pressure , @entity31 -- who was just 20 at the time -- chose to play			0
" it 's always better to go and explain what you think is good rather than boycott , " said the @entity10 president			1
" i think it 's better to explain that you are not happy , which is the same opinion i had in 1978 when i was in @entity52 for the @entity8 , " added the 58 - year - old			1
" i thought it was better to go and explain that we were not happy with what was happening in @entity52			0
" it could be the same in @entity2			0
" the @entity3 @entity89 team is facing an equally tough choice as to whether it will boycott the @entity92 or not			2
@entity3 's sports minister has already announced a personal boycott and as the tense diplomatic and military standoff continues with @entity2 , it 's possible the whole team could follow suit			1
should they do so , such a move could overshadow friday 's @entity101			0
in addition to @entity3 's sports minister , politicians from @entity103 , @entity104 , the @entity59 , @entity105 and @entity106 are among those who have already said they will stay away			0
earlier this week , the @entity109 canceled a presidential delegation to the @entity89			0
on thursday , @entity103 announced it would not send governmental representatives in order to make a " very clear political signal to @entity2 " , according to disabilities commissioner @entity114			0
@entity116 spokeswoman @entity115 told @entity0 a decision on whether the @entity3 team will boycott @entity119 will be announced at a press conference at 0930 gmt on friday .			1
