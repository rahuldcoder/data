-- i grew up an @entity3 brat who typically moved to a new place every three years			0
i switched schools , made friends , then had to write letters to stay in touch when i inevitably left			0
except for a precious few , most of those friends went away forever , lost to memory , fading and eventually anonymous in aging photos			0
but in the recurring dreams i had in my teenage years , they were all together			0
my friends from @entity16 went to school with my classmates in @entity19 , @entity20			0
my favorite teacher from my years in @entity22 got to see me grow up alongside my cousins from @entity24			0
it was n't until many years later , when @entity27 shot past its first 100 million users , that i began to get that sensation again , the one most frequent users are now well familiar with			1
it 's that sense of worlds colliding , of unlikely paths crossing ; your work life , home life , past life and present all mashing together , commented upon and decorated with photos from here and from there , from then and in the now			0
@entity27 's enormous membership makes it a more likely spot than any other place on the @entity42 to connect with a multitude of family members , friends , former co-workers , old classmates and anyone else you have n't seen in the flesh for decades			1
it was n't until the may series finale " lost , " however , that i made another connection -- that this idea of people coming into your life and never going away is a lot like what many people believe the afterlife is like			2
could it be that @entity27 , the digital @entity62 built by a cocky @entity64 student , is -- to paraphrase singer @entity65 -- sort of like what would happen if heaven were a place on earth ? the thought led me to a theological search for the spirituality of @entity27 connections			1
amid the recent flood of political rants , children 's @entity77 photos and @entity80 videos , many of us have seen status updates from friends offering @entity86 passages , spiritual quotes or information on upcoming religious services			2
along with a few alarming blog posts ( " @entity27 killed the church , " one bluntly proclaimed ) , i found a lot of theologians struggling to figure out whether mobile phones , social networks and text - messaging harm their religions or help reinvent them in positive ways			2
there 's even debate on whether being so constantly connected to so many people is good or bad , spiritually speaking			2
@entity102 , a theology professor , author and co-pastor in @entity105 , @entity106 , wrote a thoughtful piece about so - called " @entity27 theology , " likening the " intricate web of relationships " in our lives to our online social network			1
he acknowledged that even the lowly , short - form status update can carry a profound holiness			0
" it might surprise my high school friends to discover that i often pray for them as i read their posts , " @entity102 writes			0
" i believe that @entity27 can be an altar on the @entity120 and a place of spiritual awakening			1
" that seems to gibe with what pope @entity124 proclaimed earlier this year			1
in january , the pontiff suggested that priests should embrace new digital communication mediums			1
but he stopped short of blessing @entity27 itself as a virtual holy land			2
@entity27 , which recently passed the 500 - million - user mark , grew so quickly in such a short span of time that even its creators likely have n't been able to stop and examine the spiritual significance of its near - constant presence in so many lives			1
to what do we owe our continually growing house of " friends , " the ones we never see , never call , never write to , but who contribute to our digital chatter , our daily chorus			0
do n't those connections count for some kind of community ? would n't we miss it if all these non-strangers were lost to us again ? what if @entity27 itself , which digitally houses not only the living but also the " memorial page " dead , is a kind of pre-afterlife training where all those personal connections are forever maintained , even after you 've shuffled off this analog coil ? and if the afterlife exists , and it 's anything like @entity27 , does it have an " @entity164 " option ? because as much as i love all the connectedness , eternity sounds like a really long time to spend reading everyone 's status updates .			1

@entity171 : *commingling* of people from various *chapters* of our lives has spiritual *overtones*
