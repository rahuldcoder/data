@entity0 -- the national battle over guns is headed to the states in a major way			0
already groups supporting more gun restrictions have been active at the local level			1
and now for the first time in almost two decades , the @entity9 is attempting to coordinate the recall of a top state legislator over his role in the passage of new gun restrictions , @entity1 has learned			1
the focus of the @entity9 campaign is @entity19 president @entity18			1
he is facing a petition drive to initiate an election to recall him because of legislation passed this year in @entity23 requiring universal background checks on sales of all firearms in the state , as well as a ban on the sale of ammunition magazines greater than 15 rounds			1
@entity18 told @entity1 he knew that local gun groups were going after him , but did not know at the beginning the @entity9 was involved			1
" it was a grassroots effort for a little while , but when that did n't take at all , it was clear they were getting money from outside			0
and i was n't the least bit surprised the @entity9 was behind it , " @entity18 said			0
in a mailer obtained by @entity1 , the @entity43 fund wrote to a " @entity45 " in @entity23 that " your @entity9 is coordinating a recall effort with the @entity48 to put senator @entity18 on the ballot for a special election and vote him out of office			1
" the @entity9 wrote that @entity18 " led the charge to pass extreme and onerous anti-gun state legislation in @entity54 , " adding that " responsible gun owners and sportsmen will be forever burdened by his misguided leadership in the @entity19			2
" @entity18 said it was important to remember that @entity23 was " ground zero " for two of the nation 's worst mass shootings at @entity63 in @entity64 in 1999 and last july 's massacre at a movie theater in @entity67			2
" we addressed [ tighter gun regulations ] this session , but this is what we get for that response , " said @entity18			0
the @entity9 mailing suggests members sign a petition for a recall election			2
the drive has a june 3 deadline and 7,178 signatures are needed to mandate a recall ballot			0
with gun control efforts stalled in @entity0 following the failure of a proposal in the @entity19 to expand background checks , the move in @entity23 suggests that the fight is now turning to the states			1
some political observers suggest that these local battles over gun laws could end up gaining the type of attention , fundraising and ferocity that marked the failed 2012 recall election of @entity99 @entity98 gov. @entity97			0
such scenarios could pit national groups like the @entity9 against advocates like @entity103 led by @entity105 mayor @entity104 just as corporate interests , such as the @entity108 brothers , squared off in @entity98 against national labor unions			2
@entity110 , the campaign manager for @entity18 , tells @entity1 that the " @entity9 is investing in these recall races to send a message to every other local official to not pass any other gun safety measures or else the @entity9 will come after you as well			2
" the @entity9 would not comment publicly , deferring to local @entity23 gun activists involved in the petition drive			1
the @entity9 was involved in fending off the recall of @entity97 , though that was not a fight about gun laws			0
it also was involved in the successful recall of @entity124 gov. @entity123 , though that too was not a fight about guns			0
in 1994 , the @entity9 led an effort to recall @entity130 @entity124 state sen. @entity129 , who had pushed a law to ban some types of semiautomatic assault rifles in that state , though that effort was unsuccessful .			0
