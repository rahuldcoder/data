-- @entity2 's high court ruled thursday that retailers do n't have the right to ask customers for their zip code while completing credit card transactions , saying that doing so violates a cardholders ' right to protect his or her personal information			1
many retailers in @entity2 and nationwide now ask people to give their zip code , punching in that information and recording it			1
yet @entity2 @entity18 's seven justices unanimously determined that this practice goes too far			1
the ruling , penned by justice @entity21 , overrules earlier decisions by trial and appeals courts in @entity2			0
it points to a 1971 state law that prohibits businesses from asking credit cardholders for " personal identification information " that could be used to track them down			1
while a zip code is n't a full address , the court 's judgment states that asking for it -- and piecing that 5 - digit number together with other information , like a cardholder 's name -- " would permit retailers to obtain indirectly what they are clearly prohibited from obtaining directly , ( therefore ) ' end - running ' " the intent of @entity2 state laws			1
" the legislature intended to provide robust consumer protections by prohibiting retailers from soliciting and recording information about the cardholder that is unnecessary to the credit card transaction , " the decision states			0
" we hold that personal identification information ... includes the cardholder 's zip code			1
" @entity54 , president of the @entity55 , said it is " ironic " that a practice aimed partly at protecting consumers from fraud is being taken away			0
" we think it 's a terrible decision because it dramatically expands what personal information is , by including a zip code as part of an address , " @entity54 said			1
" we are surprised by it			0
" the court decision applies only in @entity2 , though it reflects a practice that is increasingly common elsewhere			0
it does not specify how or if all businesses that take credit cards , such as gas stations , would be affected -- though it does state that its objection is not over a retailer seeing a person 's zip code , but rather recording and using it for marketing purposes			2
the discussion began with a june 2008 class - action lawsuit filed initially by @entity83 against home retailer @entity84			0
in her suit , @entity85 claimed that a cashier had asked for her zip code during a purchase -- information that was recorded and later used , along with her name , to figure out her home address			2
@entity84 did this tapping a database that it uses to market products to customers and sell its compiled consumer information to other businesses			0
@entity85 contended the practice of asking for zip codes violates a person 's right to privacy , made illegal use of her personal information and gave a retailer , like @entity84 , an unfair competitive advantage			0
@entity84 claimed that a zip code does n't constitute " personal identification information , " as stated in the 1971 state law			1
the state supreme court ruling , only addressing the " identification information " issue , determined that a zip code should be protected , since the law specifically mentions protecting a cardholder 's address			1
the court concluded requesting a zip code is not much different than asking for a phone number or home address			2
it is not illegal in @entity2 for a retailer to see a person 's zip code or address , the ruling notes : for instance , one can request a customer 's driver 's license to verify his or her identity			2
what makes it wrong is when a business records that information , according to the ruling , especially when the practice is " unnecessary to the sales transaction			0
" in reversing the @entity142 judgment , the supreme court remanded the case back to a lower court to order specific changes and policies " consistent with this decision			0

@entity2 @entity18 justices vote 7 - 0 to overturn two lower court decisions
the decision finds that a zip code is protected " personal identification information "
the court objects to retailers using such info to track people down for marketing
the head of a retailers *association* says , " we think it 's a terrible decision "
