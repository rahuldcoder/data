-- from ambitious teens taking on the world and tech pioneers breaking boundaries to maverick slum dwellers dreaming big and trailblazing innovators tackling social problems , @entity0 's @entity1 has been following the efforts of the continent 's innovative and determined entrepreneurs to make their business dreams become reality			1
indeed , all across the continent , a growing wave of grassroots self - starters are taking risks and defying obstacles to bring their money - making ideas to life			0
armed with a can - do attitude and hopes of striking it big , they 're navigating a conundrum of challenges to pursue opportunities at a time when many @entity30 countries enjoy unprecedented levels of economic growth			2
" the entrepreneurial landscape in @entity39 is absolutely excellent , " says @entity33 , executive director of @entity34 ( @entity34 ) and professor at the @entity36 in @entity37			2
" it 's on the increase because @entity37 , at last , has been emerging and the economies are booming -- several countries are starting to really increase entrepreneurial activity and move to opportunity entrepreneurship , rather than necessity entrepreneurship , " he adds			1
" opportunities abound and a positive spirit is emerging amongst the population of these countries			0
" so , @entity37 's entrepreneurial spirit is alive and thriving -- but how does it compare to the rest of the world ? earlier this year , @entity34 published its annual report looking at the state of entrepreneurship globally			1
it found that @entity39 is the region with by far the highest number of people involved in early - stage entrepreneurial activity ( @entity60 ) , with @entity61 and @entity62 leading the world rankings			1
it 's a woman 's world @entity37 also leads the world in the number of women starting businesses , with almost equal levels of male and female entrepreneurs			1
in fact , in countries like @entity73 , @entity62 and @entity61 the women outnumber the men			0
overall , the continent has a much higher proportion of female entrepreneurs compared to other regions , with @entity62 and @entity61 ( both 40.7 % ) coming on top and countries like the @entity82 ( 10.4 % ) , the @entity83 ( 5.5 % ) , @entity84 ( 3.6 % ) and @entity85 ( 3.1 % ) lagging far behind			2
according to @entity33 , the main reason for this is because women in @entity37 " need to earn an extra income " to be able to afford " to send their children to school			0
" getting off the ground yet , does the high number of both male and female entrepreneurs tell the whole story ? and do these impressive figures translate to sustainable startups that are able to grow and provide employment to the continent 's young population ? in its analysis , @entity34 groups countries into geographic regions , but also according to their development stage : factor - driven , efficiency - driven and innovation - driven , each suggesting an increasing level of sophistication in the operation of the economy ( see fact box on the left )			1
most @entity30 nations surveyed are placed into the factor - driven stage , where early - stage entrepreneurial activity rates tend to be higher than the rates of owner - managers in established businesses ( running more than three and a half years )			1
in other words , " a high entrepreneurship rate does not necessarily mean the creation of a lot of jobs , " explains @entity33			0
" those countries with low gdp per capita tend to have a very high entrepreneurial rate , because the larger corporations are not taking up a lot people to provide them with the so - called formal employment , " he adds			1
calling it a day similarly , the continent might be buzzing with startups , but how long do these last ? according to @entity34 , the rate of business discontinuance tends to decrease as economic development increases			1
as a result , countries like @entity140 and @entity141 that see many new businesses also experience high numbers of people abandoning their efforts after failing to make profits			2
" the discontinuance of businesses in the factor - driven economies is very high , " says @entity33 , citing " the lack of education , market research and access to funding " as the main reasons			2
fearless entrepreneurs there are several factors hindering the survival and growth of small businesses in @entity37 -- little government support , bureaucracy and lack of financial backing to cite a few more			1
yet , all these constraints do little to prevent the continent 's budding entrepreneurs from trying their luck			0
true , entrepreneurs might be optimistic by nature , but nowhere else in the world is this key drive toward success as present as in @entity37			2
the continent 's entrepreneurs boast the lowest levels of " fear of failure , " with just 24 % responding that it would stop from starting a business and seizing business opportunities			0
in countries like @entity61 , @entity185 and @entity140 the figure drops to as little as 15 % -- compare that to countries like the @entity83 ( 36.4 % ) and the @entity82			0
all you need is confidence it 's no surprise then that @entity30 entrepreneurs are also the most confident in the world in their ability and skills to start a business			0
in comparison , people in @entity140 feel twice as self - assured about launching a startup as those in the @entity83			0
likewise , @entity39 claims the top five spots for countries where people see good opportunities for starting a business and feel positive about entrepreneurship			0
@entity33 says that it 's these qualities , coupled with a need for better education and a focus on moving entrepreneurs from necessity to opportunity , that will drive the continent 's development			0
" @entity37 is going to have to rely on small businesses ( @entity216 ) to provide the bulk of the employment , " he says			1
" in a lot of countries the @entity216 contribute more than 50 % of the gdp and more than 50 % of employment , so if you 're going to employ people in @entity37 and other developing countries it 's @entity216 are the ones that are going to provide that			1

experts say @entity37 has to rely on small businesses to provide employment
the continent has the highest rates of early - stage entrepreneurship in the world
it 's a leader for female entrepreneurship , says @entity34
yet countries with many new startups also see high levels of discontinuance
