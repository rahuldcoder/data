-- they produced the " @entity6 " but @entity3 's golfers face an almighty challenge to amaze at @entity5			1
not since @entity7 triumphed for the second time 14 years ago has anyone from across the @entity9 managed to get their hands on that green jacket			1
in fact , @entity3 's record in the tournament has been abject in recent years with @entity16 the only man to have secured a runner - up finish since the turn of the century			1
when the late , great , @entity25 became the first @entity3 to win the tournament back in 1980 , it paved the way for the likes of @entity7 , three - time champion @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and double winner @entity23 to go on and dominate			1
@entity3 recorded eight wins between 1988 and 1999 and seven out of nine between @entity21 's success and @entity20 's third title in 1996			1
but with no success since 1999 , the pressure is on @entity3 's stars to stand up and finally end the drought			1
" does it surprise me ? nothing surprises me in golf anymore , " former @entity38 told reporters			1
" i think since i 've been a professional , i feel like the fields have gotten a lot stronger , a lot deeper			2
you 're seeing anyone on a given week has a chance to win			2
" this game is a very mental game and it 's almost those who are the least fragile players that have a chance			2
" @entity55 's @entity54 hero @entity53 believes @entity3 's top players simply have n't been good enough while the likes of @entity58 and @entity59 have won five titles between them			1
" we just have n't performed very well			2
simple , " @entity53 told reporters			2
" we have n't performed well enough and i think the guys are disappointed , to be honest			0
" one of the guys would have expected to have come through by now			0
" what 's the reason for that ? i do n't know			0
@entity58 ( @entity68 ) has taken a few , @entity59 ( @entity59 ) has taken a few			0
they are pretty good those two			0
" @entity71 's @entity70 and @entity55 's @entity72 are ranked two and three in the world , while @entity38 sits fourth on the ladder			1
but they will have to be at the peak of their powers to end @entity3 's bid for a famous green jacket with the likes of @entity58 and @entity59 the men to beat once again			1
one man who believes this is his best chance of winning at @entity5 is @entity54 hero @entity53			1
the 37 - year - old was a stand out star during @entity3 's incredible fightback , but he says recreating that kind of form in an individual event is incredibly difficult			1
" you 've got two sets of fans ( at the @entity54 ) and here you 've got fans that are wishing 92 players play well , " he told reporters " it 's very difficult to get that same atmosphere , recreate it			0
it just wo n't happen			0
but what will happen is on sunday afternoon , when you 're coming down the stretch , you will be feeling the same kind of emotions			0
" the crowds might not be quite as loud , but they will be respectful of good golf shots and obviously the birdies that happen here on a sunday			0
" so i think there will be some good vibes hopefully going through me with nine holes to play and hopefully i can pull upon those @entity54 moments to bring me through			0
" while @entity3 has struggled , its troubles pales into insignificance compared to those of @entity119			1
@entity121 's meltdown in 1996 where he contrived to throw away a six - shot lead on the final day still hurts , while the ghosts of near misses in 1986 and 1987 still haunt @entity119 golf			1
@entity127 remains its best hope having finished second two years ago and the 32 - year - old is desperate to break the jinx			1
" it 's going to happen one day			0
we say it but it 's up to one of us to make it happen , " @entity127 told reporters			0
" i 've certainly developed a real level of comfort with the golf course in the last three years , so i say that ( an @entity119 will win the @entity141 ) quietly confident that i believe i can make it happen one of these years			1
" @entity127 has demons of his own to exorcise after losing out in dramatic fashion at last year 's @entity146 whee he ended his final round with four consecutive bogeys			2
but @entity127 is adamant he has learned from the experience and is ready to go for it at @entity5			1
he added : " when i got in position to win again , that 's when it was gut - check time as a player , to not let it become a thing ... that you struggle to close out a golf tournament			2
" i do n't dwell on it at all			0
i just take the positives			0
it was great for me to play so well for so long			0
you need a little bit of winner 's luck			2
" everyone who wins a tournament has it , but it 's not something you can make happen			0
i guess it just happens and when it 's meant to be , it 's meant to be			0
" that stuff , you ca n't control , but i think the golfing gods sort all that kind of stuff out			0
