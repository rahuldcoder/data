" i have five days to recover from surgery and look good before my husband gets home			1
" @entity4 , a 60 - year - old @entity6 woman , sits before me to sign the consent forms for her upcoming operations : a @entity10 face - lift , upper and lower eyelid lifts and an endoscopic brow lift			0
i see on her information sheet that she has n't authorized us to discuss her surgeries with anyone else -- not even her husband			1
" so you 're not telling him about all these procedures ? " " not unless i have to			1
you do n't know him			1
he would n't understand , and he would n't want me to spend all this money , especially on something he thinks is frivolous			1
so that 's why i need to look good before he gets back			0
we 've got five days , dr. @entity26			1
" cosmetic surgery has become a new form of infidelity -- for both men and women			1
as the number of people having plastic surgery rises , more and more feel the need to hide their procedures from their significant others			1
in fact , we did a survey of cosmetic patients in my office and found that one - third do n't tell their partners about their treatments			1
hard to believe ? while surgery can be difficult to hide , especially large operations with dramatic changes such as tummy tucks and face - lifts , less - invasive procedures such as @entity52 and filler injections are n't as hard to conceal			1
body modification -- or mutilation ? the first step many patients take is to hide how much they 're spending			1
according to the @entity59 , the average cost of @entity52 is $ 392 , and the average cost of @entity61 is $ 675 -- pretty hefty amounts to cover up			0
so how do they do it ? some patients pay with cash			2
others split it up and pay half in cash , half in credit			0
many of my patients have a certain threshold that they can spend on their credit card before their partner notices the individual charge			2
this amount usually ranges between $ 100 and $ 400			0
often the patient will spend up to that amount on a credit card , then pay the rest in cash			0
other patients spread small amounts over several credit cards			2
timing the procedure strategically is another way people hide their cosmetic treatments			1
many patients , like @entity4 , have their surgeries done while their spouses are out of town			2
they use this alone time to recover , so that when their spouses return , they 're none the wiser			2
for less - invasive treatments , such as lasers and injections , many patients have the procedures performed on days when their partners have plans after work			1
this way , they have all night to let the swelling subside			0
when their spouse sees them the next day , they look normal again			0
you do n't want a jack - of - all - trades surgeon some women also take advantage of the fact that their men just are n't that perceptive			1
men are notoriously bad at noticing changes in their spouses			0
in fact , a 2004 study in the @entity121 found that women are much better than men at remembering appearances			0
i am as bad as any			0
it can take me days to notice that my wife has changed her hair			0
so what happened with @entity4 ? she underwent all four surgeries , with the hope that she 'd look good enough five days later to prevent her husband from noticing the dramatic changes in her face			0
she stopped by the office to see me several hours before her husband was to return home			2
@entity4 was a hot mess			0
her eyes looked like she went 10 rounds with @entity142 , her neck was taut as a pair of @entity145 , and her lips resembled two @entity148 sausages			0
you 're still quite puffy and bruised , but give it another week or two and you 'll look fantastic , " i told her			2
" however , i 'm not sure your plan to hide your plastic surgery from your husband is going to work			1
" " dr. @entity26 , " she deadpanned			1
" you do n't know my husband			2
" he never figured it out .			0
