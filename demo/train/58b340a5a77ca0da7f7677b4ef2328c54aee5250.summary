" @entity6 " sacked " @entity7 " at the box office on @entity1 weekend , but both modestly - budgeted films exceeded industry expectations and brought in strong grosses for their respective studios			1
@entity8 's $ 15 million found footage film " @entity6 , " a thriller directed by newcomer @entity11 about a trio of teenage boys who acquire super powers , soared into first place with $ 22 million in its first three days			1
that gave the film a potent $ 7,568 per theater average -- the best in the @entity20			0
awareness for " @entity6 " appeared disconcertingly low a few weeks ago , but thanks to an aggressive tv marketing push , a viral video advertisement ( " @entity27 in @entity28 " ) , and , perhaps most notably , the film 's zeitgeist - y found footage appeal , the adventure managed to bring young people to the theater in droves			1
the surprise hit received an average " b " @entity35 grade , with generations divided on the found footage factor : audiences under 18 gave the movie a " @entity42 " , while audiences above 50 issued it a " @entity41 "			0
thankfully for @entity8 , older moviegoers do n't make up " @entity6 's " target demographic			0
despite the average grade , with reviews so much stronger than most films aimed at teens , and an encouraging 18 percent bump on saturday ( which suggests positive word - of - mouth ) , " @entity6 " might not plummet at the box office the way " f " graded " @entity53 " did a few weeks ago			1
there 's no telling how high " @entity6 " will end up flying at the box office just yet , but with its impressive debut frame , the film is already a big hit			0
while the execs at @entity8 are clinking their champagne glasses together , the suits over at @entity61 are likely getting ready to throw an all - out party after the the second - place debut of " @entity7 , " which earned $ 21 million this weekend and became the young studio 's first real hit			1
the supernatural spookfest , which @entity61 acquired for just $ 3 million from @entity71 financier @entity69 , succeeded in capturing young viewers ( especially young women ) on opening weekend , and @entity73 himself , @entity75 , proved his drawing power outside of the @entity73 franchise -- something the twilight stars have yet to do			2
" @entity7 " earned a lackluster " b - " cinemascore grade , but , like " @entity6 , " the film has already proved itself a major success			1
in third , @entity84 's snowy survival entry " @entity85 " dipped 52 percent to $ 9.5 million , giving it a ten - day total of $ 34.8 million			1
do n't be deceived by the brisk decline			0
because of the @entity1 , which will keep over 100 million @entity90 in their living rooms and out of theaters , studios are estimating drops in the 70 percent - range on sunday , which causes most titles to have larger - than - usual weekend drops			1
" @entity85 " is doing well			0
" @entity103 , " @entity97 's family - friendly option starring @entity98 as a woman attempting to save three whales locked inside @entity102 ice , swam away with a rather chilly $ 8.5 million in its first three days			1
the film , made for just under $ 40 million , could n't capture the same size audience as fellow aquatic mammal offering , " @entity106 , " which started with $ 19.2 million on its way to a $ 72.3 million total last september			2
with an " a- " @entity35 grade and strong playability among families , " @entity103 " may hold well in the weeks to come			0
as it stands now , though , this whale tale looks dead in the water			0
" @entity116 " rounded out the @entity115 5 , dipping 55 percent to $ 5.6 million			2
the $ 70 million @entity118 action film has amassed $ 54.4 million after three weekends , making it the second - highest grossing film of 2012			2
what 's ahead of it ? @entity124 's other action vehicle , " @entity125 , " which has earned $ 61.2 million			1
not a bad way to the start year ! a few milestones were achieved by @entity129 contenders this weekend , too			0
" @entity131 ' " $ 4.6 million frame helped it scoot right past $ 65 million in its 12th week			0
@entity133 favorite " @entity134 " dropped 22 percent to $ 2.6 million in its 11th week , breaking the $ 20 million plateau in the process			1
" @entity141 " fell by only 8 percent ( the smallest drop in the @entity20 ) in its 11th week to $ 2.3 million , lifting its total out of the $ 50 million - range up to $ 62 million			1
( it 's rumored to have cost over twice that amount			0
) and " @entity147 " came this close to a key milestone , but for now , it will have to settle for a $ 99.9 million total			2
chronicle -- $ 22.0 million 2			0
the @entity7 -- $ 21.0 mil 3			2
the @entity149 -- $ 9.5 mil 4			1
@entity103 -- $ 8.5 mil 5			0
