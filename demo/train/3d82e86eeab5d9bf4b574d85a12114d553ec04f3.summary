-- in the ice skating community , @entity1 and @entity2 are known as " the moms " because they have been nearly inseparable for 16 years			1
that 's when their children , @entity9 and @entity10 , started skating together as ice dancers			1
the skating duo , @entity13 silver medalists in @entity14 in 2010 and world champions in 2013 , were favorites to bring home the gold medal in the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 -- and they delivered			2
after placing first with a world - record 78.89 score in the short dance , @entity26 and @entity10 earned a world - record 116.63 in the free program on monday , bringing home the first - ever gold medal for the @entity30 in the ice dancing competition			1
their moms , who fly to and from every competition together , planned to be seated @entity35 at the @entity13 : @entity26 always on the right , @entity10 on her left			1
" even in an interview now , @entity2 will say , ' wait a minute , she 's on the wrong side , ' " said @entity26 , a mother of two from @entity41 , @entity42			2
it 's just one of the many rituals these @entity13 moms follow as they gear up for what they hoped would be a history - making competition for their children			1
' @entity51 ' @entity10 always wears a pair of " lucky @entity53 , " and she does n't change her jewelry , a habit that dates to her years as a hockey mom			1
( @entity10 played 13 years of travel hockey and was part of a state championship winning team			1
) " the hockey moms used to see me come in			2
if i was wearing a different pair of earrings , they 'd look at me ( and say ) , ' hey , you were n't wearing those earrings the last time we won , and it 's the first time they scored on us			1
you are taking them off , ' " said @entity10 , a mother of five , also from @entity70 , @entity42			1
" so i am now superstitious ... and i ca n't get over it , " she said , chuckling			2
@entity26 has her own rituals , including writing down every skater 's scores			2
" i always take my pad with me , and i always write down every score , and then if i miss one , i 'm like , ' oh , darn ... ' but it does n't matter , " @entity26 said with a laugh			2
the task is pointless , she admitted , since she never looks at the scores again			2
" it just keeps us thinking about something else , " she said			0
" it gives us a little distraction			0
" ' not sure what we gave up ' @entity26 and @entity10 are just two of the thousands of @entity13 moms around the country and the world who devoted hours , energy and money -- and a good chunk of their own lives -- to make their children 's @entity13 dreams come true			1
but do n't mention the " s word " to them : sacrifice			0
they do n't believe they 've sacrificed to get here			2
" i know that people want to call it a sacrifice , and it is in some ways , because you do put a lot of your time and a lot of your money into it			0
but on the other hand , a sacrifice almost means you are almost giving up a lot , " @entity26 said			0
" i am not sure what we gave up			0
" the early years were harder , @entity26 and @entity10 admit , especially as both kids trained for singles ' competitions in addition to working together on ice dancing			1
@entity9 , who just turned 27 , started skating at age 5			1
@entity10 , 26 , began when he was 3			1
" we were there every single day			0
we would drive them , pick them up from school , drive them to the rink , stay with them ... rush over while they were on the ice and get them a bagel with cream cheese or chocolate milk or whatever they wanted , " @entity10 said			1
" it 's long enough ago so that it gets kind of blurred into the rest of the years , but early on , it was a lot of time			0
it was a lot more dedication and work for us , but it was work we really enjoyed and really loved , so it does n't fall in the ' sacrifice ' label			0
" ' each one is special ' an additional challenge for any @entity13 family is making sure the other siblings do n't feel shadowed by a 24/7 commitment to a sport			0
championship figure skating includes four or five hours on the ice every day , dance lessons , physical fitness training , travel to competitions , research for costumes , appearances and interviews			2
@entity169 of @entity170 , @entity171 , is a mom of six whose daughter @entity172 won the @entity13 gold in figure skating in 2002 and whose daughter @entity175 competed in the @entity176			0
" i think because there were six of them , it was much healthier , " @entity169 said			0
" people would come in , ( and ) they said , ' you do n't have all of @entity172 and @entity175 's stuff up ; you have everybody 's			0
' " i said , ' well , each one is special			0
' " @entity169 recently asked @entity175 what she did as a mom to raise an @entity189 , " she says , ' oh , @entity192 , you got us everywhere we had to go , and then you 'd forget to pick us up			0
' and i laughed , and i said , ' you know , you 're right			0
' " ' @entity10 's my boat ' raising an olympian , especially in figure skating with the cost of ice time , lessons , choreography , costumes and travel , can take a financial toll on a family			1
@entity169 , @entity10 and @entity26 say they 're thankful that was n't their experience			1
" i have to ask ( my husband ) , how did we do it ? i ca n't answer that , because i do n't know			0
i just know we kept going and going , " said @entity169 , whose husband is a real estate tax attorney			0
" it was n't like some skating families ( who ) have to remortgage their house			0
we did n't have to do that , " said @entity26 , a former teacher			0
" when you look at what other people sacrifice -- and people we know , personally , are some of those people -- it breaks my heart that they 've put so much into it and not all kids are lucky enough to get where our kids are			1
" @entity10 jokes that she does n't know how much she 's spent on more than 20 years of ice skating because she tries " not to look			1
" " we try not to add it up , because i 'm sure if we added it up , then we would start to feel like , ' oh , my @entity235 , we 've made such a sacrifice , ' " @entity10 said			1
" i always tell @entity9 she 's my cottage , " said @entity26 , joking that money spent on skating could have bought the family a second home			1
" and @entity10 's my boat , " @entity10 added			1
' thank you , @entity244 ' both @entity26 and @entity10 are part of @entity247 's " thank you , @entity244 , " program , which highlights the awe - inspiring contributions of @entity13 moms			1
the program includes providing a " family home " in @entity21 , where @entity30 athletes and their families can get free meals and beauty services , as well as help for @entity30 families to pay the travel costs to @entity22			0
each @entity13 , the company creates an ad that seems to make just about every mom -- this one included -- need to grab the tissues			2
in the current ad , moms are seen picking up their toddlers after falls on the ice and in the snow and bucking them up when things were not going their way			1
" when i watch that commercial , it really grabs my heart , " @entity10 said			1
" i think you sit there and you wonder , how many times can you fall and get back up again ? your first instinct is to go out there and say ' stop hurting yourself ; let me take you home to something fun , ' but you do n't , because the more loving thing is to let them go , let them pick themselves up sometimes and let them continue on and get stronger because of it			0
" ' you ca n't help but cry ' how much joy did " the moms " expect to feel when they watched @entity9 and @entity10 compete for @entity13 gold in @entity21 ? " every time we talk about the joy of it and how much we love it , that 's when we start to cry , " @entity26 said			1
" you are so bursting with pride ( about ) who they are and what they 've accomplished that you always start to cry			2
you ca n't help but cry			0
" @entity10 says she 's sometimes wondered , does skating create the person that is so awesome , or does the awesomeness of the person create the skater ? " because i look at @entity9 and @entity10 , they 're such an awesome couple as people , and i just wonder , has the discipline and everything that is involved in their skating career helped to shape that personality ? " we feel proud of the people they are			1
i feel that that 's what we are most proud of , " @entity10 said			2
@entity169 planned to watch @entity9 and @entity10 , and all the other skaters , from her living room in @entity171			1
she knows exactly what it feels like to watch not one , but two children compete for @entity13 gold			0
" indescribable , " she said with a laugh			0
" we did n't expect any of this			0
i just feel like it 's all this tremendous gift ... and the whole family was thrilled			0
we were all there for everybody			0
" what do you think it takes to raise an olympian ? chime in below in comments or tell @entity343 on @entity344 and @entity345 on @entity346 , or share your photos and stories on @entity349 !			2

ice dancers @entity9 and @entity10 still make their moms tear up
many moms of @entity355 *downplay* talk sacrifices they 've made
moms admit to competition rituals such as wearing a pair of " lucky @entity53 "
the financial challenges of raising an olympian can be *staggering* , moms say
