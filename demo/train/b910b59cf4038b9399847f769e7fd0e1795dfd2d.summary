an 8 - foot spirit rock outside a @entity3 high school has a bright , new message of solidarity after students replaced a racist message left by a vandal			1
less than a week after a judge in @entity11 righted a wrong of the @entity14 era , someone used white spray paint to scrawl " happy n * * * er @entity23 " on the rock outside the city 's @entity17 , an apparent reference to the start of @entity21			1
the crime likely happened overnight saturday			2
a school employee noticed the vandalism sunday , according to a police incident report , and a maintenance worker quickly painted over the graffiti			1
art students at the school then grabbed brushes and cans of paint to make a point			1
by monday , three students had painted the @entity37 over a rainbow backdrop with yellow handprints and the words " we are all " and a large equal sign on the rock			1
" i wanted the students to stop texting and tweeting and blogging that image , " said visual arts teacher @entity43			1
" we wanted to replace it with something positive			2
" @entity11 police officers reviewed school surveillance video but it was so " dark and grainy , " they were not able to identify any potential suspects in the vandalism , capt. @entity48 said			1
" while the district is disappointed in the actions of those who painted the rock , we will not let them take from us our joy or success in the progress our community has made , and will continue to make , in racial relations , " according to a statement posted on the @entity66 's facebook page			1
just days earlier , the @entity11 community honored members of the @entity69 , who led a protest during the civil rights era			1
a judge erased their convictions , related to a 1961 sit - in at a segregated lunch counter			2
judge tosses ' @entity69 ' convictions the men were convicted of trespassing and ordered to pay a $ 100 fine or spend 30 days at a work camp			0
" kids all over the country were going to school -- demonstrating in the afternoon , after school , in the mornings , and then being arrested , then paying the fine and we were n't making any progress , " friendship nine member @entity81 told @entity0			1
all but one of the students from @entity92 opted for the jail time			2
" so ' jail , no bail ' gave us an opportunity to be arrested , spend the 30 days in jail without paying the money			0
in so doing , it would help keep the money in our treasury and not swell the treasury of the city and the county , " @entity81 said			0
" after that , it caught on			0
by summer , you had kids from all over the country filling the jailhouses up , " @entity81 said			0
after writing a book about the @entity69 , a local children 's author urged 16th circuit solicitor @entity114 to seek a pardon for the men			2
" a pardon is an act of forgiveness , but what these guys needed was not forgiveness			0
what these guys needed was justice , " @entity114 said			0
" justice served is the greatest interest of man on earth , " judge @entity126 said about his move to officially vacate the convictions			0
@entity126 is the nephew of the judge who presided over the case			0
" we can not rewrite history , but we can right history , " @entity126 said .			0
