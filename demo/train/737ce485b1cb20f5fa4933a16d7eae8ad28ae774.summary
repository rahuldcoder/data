@entity0 , @entity1 -- when i was a child in @entity4 , @entity5 , i loved games with clear , unambiguous rules ; puzzles that were tough but fair ; and the clean , abstract , simplicity of numbers and symbols			1
so it is perhaps not surprising that i have been drawn to mathematics for as long as i can remember			0
for much of my childhood , playing with mathematical problems , equations and facts was one of my favorite activities ; i even went so far as to compete in international high school mathematics competitions , racing to solve tricky sets of problems in a few hours			0
i still remember the realization in college at @entity25 in @entity5 that mathematics was not just an abstract game of symbols , but could be used as a tool to analyze and understand the modern world			1
why are some statistics trustworthy and some not ? why are some investment strategies sound , and others risky ? how come a computer can search the entire internet for you in a matter of seconds , but can not read a printed word if it is even just slightly distorted or blurred ? how come our modern array of satellites can tell millions of drivers their location with amazing accuracy , but can not correctly predict the weather a fortnight into the future ? knowledge of mathematics can answer these questions , and make the world comprehensible and orderly rather than mysterious and capricious			1
once i saw the power of this knowledge , and the satisfying feeling when everything " clicks " and one sees a confusing problem resolve itself into a clear solution , i was hooked for life			2
i wanted to use mathematics to explore and understand as much of the world as i could			0
in 1992 , when i was 16 , i moved to the @entity64 to start working on my ph.d. at @entity66 in @entity67			2
i alternated my time between @entity5 and the @entity64 for many years , but by 1999 i had a permanent job in the @entity64 , on the faculty of @entity71 's @entity70			1
by 2002 , i was married to an @entity64 -- we were married in the @entity64 -- and last year i became a @entity64 citizen ( while retaining @entity5 citizenship )			1
of course , my life is more than just my work			0
i am a husband and a father and a proud citizen of two countries ; my homeland of @entity5 and my adopted country here in the @entity64			1
i identify with them both			0
i enjoy a good meal , a good vacation or a good movie , much as anyone else would			0
but mathematics is both my profession and my hobby , and the place where it seems i am best able to make a contribution ; so if i had to answer the question " who am i ? " i would have to say , " a mathematician			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity99			0

when he was a *boy* in @entity5 , @entity99 says , he loved games , puzzles , math problems
once he realized that math could answer questions about the world , he was hooked , he says
at 16 he came to @entity64 to study for @entity110 ; split life between @entity64 and @entity5 ; married in @entity64
@entity99 : i *'m* husband , *dad* , citizen of both countries now , but my identity is as a mathematician
