-- the first day of 2014 was a day to celebrate in our history -- it was the first time that all @entity4 could buy health insurance regardless of pre-existing medical conditions , thanks to the @entity8			1
but despite the good news , criticism of the @entity8 continues			2
some @entity11 have eagerly identified individuals who are not happy with the @entity8			1
@entity13 : better health not about @entity8 , it 's about you as 2014 — a midterm election year — dawns , it is time to ask : what does the @entity11 offer other than negativism ? what is the @entity11 alternative to the @entity8 , who would it help and who would it hurt ? until now , the @entity11 war cry has been repeal , for which they have voted repeatedly			1
but @entity8 repeal is neither realistic , responsible , nor perhaps , even possible			1
the 10 titles of the @entity8 contain hundreds of provisions that reform @entity35 payment , combat fraud and abuse , and improve health care quality			2
many are already in place			0
total repeal of the @entity8 would rip many threads already woven into the fabric of our health care system			1
opinion : when will we get the verdict on @entity8 ? a targeted repeal of the less popular provisions of the @entity8 , the individual and employer mandates and some @entity8 taxes and fees , might be more feasible			1
but revoking the mandates would disrupt insurance markets and repealing the taxes will increase the deficit			0
does the @entity11 have anything constructive to offer ? the answer , sadly , is not really			2
@entity59 @entity11 have put forward two proposals -- the @entity61 , sponsored by a majority of @entity63 , and rep. @entity65 's @entity64			1
both are lengthy bills that largely recycle longstanding @entity11 panaceas			2
the @entity61 would replace the @entity8 's income - based tax credits with flat dollar tax deductions			2
tax deductions are valuable to high - income @entity4 with high tax rates , but offer little or nothing to the low - income @entity4 helped by the @entity8			1
the @entity64 offers flat dollar tax credits that do not vary by age , geography , or health status — all of which could influence health insurance premiums			0
these tax credits might almost fully cover the health insurance premium of a young healthy male , but would be essentially useless to an older , low - income family , which would be left thousands of dollars short of the cost of basic coverage			2
the @entity61 touts health savings accounts as the solution to every problem , but tax - subsidized health savings accounts are also primarily of value to higher - income @entity4 and useless to @entity4 whose income is too low to be taxed and who lack discretionary income to invest in health savings accounts			0
as the media spotlight high cost sharing under @entity8 plans in the coming months , it should ask how much higher cost sharing would be under the @entity11 plans			1
conservatives , such as @entity105 , champion very high deductible policies , and @entity11 proposals , unlike the @entity8 , do not limit cost sharing			1
by repealing the @entity8 , @entity11 would reinstate pre-existing condition exclusions for many of the uninsured			1
the primary relief they offer to the uninsured with health problems are state high - risk pools			0
high - risk pools , however , are very expensive , and without massive federal support would be unaffordable to many @entity4			0
exclusion of @entity4 from insurance coverage would also likely increase under @entity11 proposals to permit interstate health insurance sales , which could drive a race to the bottom in state insurance regulation			1
association health plans have a history of undermining state reforms aimed at covering individuals and groups with pre-existing conditions			0
opinion : why i signed up for @entity8 one can not imagine a @entity11 health care proposal that did not promise to place more barriers in the way of @entity4 injured by medical negligence who seek compensation			1
although our medical litigation system could certainly use reform , proposals for change would reduce health care costs by only a small amount : half a percent , according to the @entity149 , including defensive medicine			0
@entity11 malpractice " reform " proposals may be politically popular , but do not address our health care system 's real problems			1
the @entity11 does not promise that if you like your insurance plan you can keep it , and with good reason			0
the vast majority of privately insured @entity4 are covered through their work			0
the @entity61 would abolish current deductions and exclusions for employer - sponsored health insurance			0
this would not only be one of the largest middle class tax increases in @entity4 history , but could result in millions of @entity4 losing employer - sponsored insurance			0
whatever disruptions the @entity8 may cause in coming months , it moves us toward more comprehensive and affordable coverage for low - and middle - income and sicker @entity4			0
the alternatives proposed by @entity63 would be very disruptive , and unsurprisingly , benefit the healthy and wealthy			2
americans must ask themselves : who offers the most needed reforms for our health care system ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0

@entity178 : the first day of 2014 was a day to celebrate in our history
@entity178 : despite promises of @entity8 , *republicans* are critical or call for repeal
he says alternative proposals offered by @entity63 help the rich and healthy
@entity178 : as high cost sharing under @entity8 will be *discussed* , just look at @entity11 plans
