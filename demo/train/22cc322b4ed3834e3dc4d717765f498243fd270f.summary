when the two bombs went off at the @entity2 , i was reminded right away of another april day torn apart by violence			1
april 19 , 1995 , began as a calm , clear day in my hometown of @entity6 , @entity7			1
i was a young college student at the time , aspiring to be a journalist			2
i was driving to work when i heard the news			2
just then six @entity12 cars screamed past me , racing towards downtown			2
things like this did n't happen here			0
in the days after the bombing , i contacted my family and friends to make sure they were safe			1
i also sought out survivors like @entity23 , who was living in the @entity24 , which was a few short blocks away from the target of the bombing , the @entity29			1
she was just getting up for the day when the blast rocked the entire area , shattering windows and spreading debris			1
" it scared me to death			0
i have no idea if everyone got out of my apartment building , " she told me			0
the blast left her homeless and without a car			1
i spoke with @entity42 again a day after the attack in @entity44 , and she said the marathon bombing brought back memories of the @entity7 bombing			1
other fellow @entity48 that i knew felt the same way , including journalist @entity51 , who was in the post office across the street from the @entity29 building when the bomb detonated			1
" it 's safe to say that [ the ] explosions in @entity44 do n't sit well with people here , " @entity51 said			0
" people here have moved on with their lives , but naturally we remember our pain when things like this happen			0
and april is still a difficult month for some			1
" we felt a deep sense of loss and grief and came together in solidarity and support			2
people stepped forward and offered to help			0
like maj. @entity73 of the @entity6 @entity74 , who had been on the scene for just 20 minutes when police officer @entity77 found 1 - year - old @entity78 in the rubble and handed her to @entity73			1
@entity81 was one of the 19 children who were lost that day and the images of her little body carefully cradled in @entity73 ' arms became an enduring symbol for many			2
eighteen years later , @entity73 watched some of the coverage from @entity44 at his fire station in @entity6 and says the images struck a familiar cord			1
" 9/11 was a different scale , but this being right in a downtown area and you know , this hit a lot closer to home than 9/11 did , " @entity73 said			0
when he saw interviews with the first responders in @entity44 , he noticed that they answered questions the way he did that day			2
" the images they saw were what i saw , " he said			0
@entity48 have never been the kind to dwell on the past , but we wo n't forget the 168 people who died in the blast on april 19 and those who bravely survived			1
that day does not define us , even if it has become a part of our story			2
through the years , we have moved on			0
we are survivors , and we have thrived			1
@entity73 reflects that healing in the wake of a terror attack like @entity6 or @entity44 takes a lot of time			1
" it took a while , " he said			0
" i 've done some counseling			0
it will never be just another day , but now i do n't dread it like i used to			2
it 's not something you forget , and it 's going to be with them for a long time			0
if you think you might need help , talk to somebody about that			0
that was something i did wrong			0
my heart goes out to them			0
" he adds that the definition of " normal " changed for @entity48 after the attack			1
maybe @entity139 would feel the same way			1
but despite what we 've gone through , we are resilient , strong , and we wo n't let the actions of the perpetrators get to us .			0
