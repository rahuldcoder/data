-- the man believed to be the suicide bomber who killed seven @entity4 employees and contractors last month appears in a newly released video , in which he vows revenge for the killing of a @entity10 leader			1
the video shows @entity11 , whom a former @entity13 intelligence official identified as the suicide bomber			1
@entity15 's brother told @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity16 that the man in the video , who uses the @entity18 , was his sibling			1
in the tape , which aired saturday on the @entity23 satellite news channel @entity24 , @entity20 says his message is for the @entity4 and @entity27 intelligence			1
the december 30 bombing at a @entity13 base in @entity31 , in southeastern @entity28 , killed seven @entity4 operatives and a @entity27 army captain			1
@entity15 was a @entity27 doctor whom @entity27 authorities had recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source , a @entity27 official told @entity0 this week			1
@entity27 and @entity13 intelligence agencies apparently believed @entity20 had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt @entity41 , @entity43 's no. 2 figure , a former @entity13 intelligence official said			2
@entity15 says in the video that his faith can not be sold to bidders , an apparent message to @entity27 and @entity13 officials that they had failed to win his allegiance			1
it puts into question how well the @entity4 and other intelligence agencies can penetrate @entity43			2
gen. @entity53 , head of @entity54 , told @entity0 's @entity55 that local officials are better at " human intelligence " than foreign agents			0
" that 's not to say that you ca n't have some real breakthroughs , " @entity53 said during the interview , to be aired sunday			0
" it 's not to say you ca n't develop sources , you ca n't put people in there and so forth			0
" @entity15 mentions @entity67 , the leader of the @entity10 in @entity68 who was killed in a missile strike last august			1
" we will never forget the blood of our leader @entity67 , may @entity74 have mercy on his soul , " he says in @entity23 , according to a @entity0 translation			1
" it will remain that we take revenge ( for his death ) in @entity13 and outside @entity13			0
it is a trust on every person who left everything for the sake of @entity74 , whom @entity67 supported			2
" @entity43 's commander of operations in @entity28 , @entity86 , said this week that the attack avenged @entity67 's death			2
@entity67 was the leader of @entity90 ( @entity90 )			1
it was @entity90 that released the video , according to @entity93 , a think tank that specializes in tracking terrorist groups			2
at one point , the video shows the date of december 20 , 2009			0
that is five days before @entity99 passenger @entity98 allegedly tried to blow up a @entity101 flight to @entity102 , @entity103			0
the @entity105 - based group @entity104 has claimed responsibility for the @entity108 plot			0
it is impossible to know whether the date on the video is accurate , or whether @entity20 was aware of @entity98 's alleged plans			0
if @entity20 did know about the plot , it could indicate a greater degree of communication between @entity90 and @entity43 than previously thought			0
in an analysis of the video , @entity93 said there is a connection between the two groups			0
but @entity93 also pointed out @entity20 appears in the video next to @entity90 leader @entity120 , and that it was @entity90 that released the video			1
" the @entity90 and @entity43 have a close relationship , and in all likelihood @entity43 was involved at some level in the operation , " @entity93 said in an analysis of the video			0
" however , the release of the video with @entity90 emir @entity120 firmly places the attack under the @entity90 banner			0
" of the seven @entity4 operatives who were killed in the december 30 attack were two members of the private security firm @entity132 , formerly known as @entity132			1
the @entity27 military officer who was killed was @entity135 capt. @entity134 , a cousin of @entity27 's @entity136 it was one of the worst attacks ever on @entity13 's intelligence community			2
@entity0 's @entity16 and @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
