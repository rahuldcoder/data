-- where in the world are children toiling dangerous and dirty conditions , missing out on education and other basic rights ? a new report by risk analysis firm @entity8 , which ranks 197 countries , identifies @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 as the 10 places where child labor is most prevalent			1
countries with high poverty rates fare badly in the index due to the need for children to supplement their family income , the report said , but economically important countries like @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 were also found to have extreme risks because child labor laws are often poorly enforced			1
trafficking of children into forced labor or sexual exploitation remains a big problem , the report added			0
despite its fast - growing economy , @entity28 has witnessed a substantial increase in child labor risks over the past year , ranking 20th compared with 53rd a year earlier			1
the report said that unofficial estimates suggested that 100,000 children are employed in the country 's manufacturing sector			0
@entity46 " the use of vocational work and study schemes , along with the continued use of children in factories , present significant supply chain risks to companies even in the more economically developed provinces , " the report said			0
last year , electronics supplier @entity56 admitted that interns as young as 14 worked at one of its @entity28 plants			0
however , the report pointed to minor improvements in the risk of child labor , with @entity64 now ranked as " high risk " rather than " extreme risk			1
" in september , the @entity67 estimated that the rate of five to 17 year olds engaged in child labor had decreased to 10.6 % in 2012 from 13.6 % in 2008			2
the number of children involved in the worst forms of child labor has decreased to 85 million from 115 million during this time			2
the company compiles the ranking by evaluating the frequency and severity of reported child labor incidents , as well as tracking how governments prevent child labor and ensure perpetrators are held accountable			2
the index has been developed to help companies understand the risks of children being employed in their supply chains .			0
