-- @entity2 there was a galaxy of stars which burned bright in the " @entity5 " , a trio of world champions who played football from another planet and sparked a @entity12 love affair with the beautiful game			2
the star - spangled @entity14 ( @entity14 ) and the @entity16 , for a brief time , helped football take off on the other side of the @entity20			1
@entity21 , widely regarded as the finest footballer of all time , his fellow @entity25 @entity24 and @entity27 great @entity26 formed the formidable spine of the @entity16 -- the most - celebrated team in @entity12 soccer history			1
" before joining the @entity16 i was playing for @entity31 in @entity25 , " @entity24 , who left @entity31 to join the @entity16 in 1977 , told @entity0			1
" we 'd read in the newspaper everyday how successful football was in @entity35			0
" every game they broke records for people at the game , 75,000 , 77,000 , 78,000 ... i thought , i ca n't miss out on this ! " a crowd of 73,064 watched on at @entity43 as the @entity16 beat the @entity44 in august 1978 to win a second consecutive @entity45 , the @entity14 's championship match			1
but by 1984 , the team built around @entity21 , @entity24 and @entity26 , along with the @entity14 , had sunk into a blackhole of obscurity			1
" @entity53 means a lot to me , " reflected @entity24 , who played 100 times for the club in two separate spells			1
" i had great moments during the six years i was in @entity35			2
we contributed a lot to bringing football , soccer to the @entity60			0
my dream today is to see the new @entity16 come back and be a great success			1
" his dream could be about to come true			0
after nearly three decades in the dark , the fabled name of the @entity16 is staging a reawakening in the city that never sleeps			1
this week @entity21 stood alongside the @entity16 ' latest @entity25 - born star @entity68 to turn the top of the @entity71 green and announce the club 's return to competitive action			1
an august 3 fixture against the @entity76 in a relaunched @entity14 will be the @entity16 ' first league fixture since september 15 , 1984			1
the latest incarnation of the @entity14 is an eight - team competition , which is unrelated to the @entity12 's current leading football competition @entity80 ( @entity80 )			2
" i think the potential is enormous , " the @entity16 ' coo @entity81 told @entity0			1
" everybody remembers the @entity16 and everybody has a story about it			1
we certainly have the potential to do that again			0
" the club was refounded in 2010 and a host of former stars have aligned to boost the returning team 's profile			2
the @entity16 are once again competing in the @entity14 , which has been up and running as an eight - team league since 2011			1
the league has the enviable task of matching @entity80 , which was established as part of the @entity12 's successful bid to host the 1994 @entity98 and has housed star names like @entity100 and @entity101			0
@entity81 knows more than most about creating a @entity35 soccer success stories			0
for three years the @entity103 worked at the city 's biggest @entity80 ( @entity80 ) franchise the @entity105 , helping the club move into the purpose - built , 25,000 - seater @entity107			2
he plans to repeat the trick for the @entity16 with plans already in place for a $ 400m stadium complex in @entity114 area			1
@entity81 also played a part in bringing @entity101 , a world and @entity118 champion with @entity119 , to the @entity60 from @entity120 in 2010			0
while the @entity16 ' history is littered with stellar names , the modern - day team are starting from humble beginnings -- namely the @entity125 in @entity126			1
it is home to third - tier @entity130 club @entity129 and the venue for a key exhibition match for coach @entity134 's newly - built team			1
the @entity16 lost 2 - 1			1
" we 're very careful to say this is not 1977 , this is not 77,000 at @entity43 , we do n't have @entity21 and @entity26 , " @entity81 replies when asked about the task he faces in trying to live up to the @entity16 ' stellar past			1
" we have a good squad and we play good soccer and we will grow from there			0
it needs to be built up , we ca n't start at that level overnight			0
" but the @entity16 have been able to recruit one player whose caliber is undeniable			1
@entity68 enjoyed a successful career in @entity146 with @entity148 club @entity147 , helping the team reach the 2006 @entity151 semifinals			2
the midfielder also represented his adopted homeland at international level and he was a key member of the @entity156 team which won @entity157 and kick started @entity156 's recent period of dominance			2
the @entity16 ' legacy is built on the recruitment of players like @entity68 and @entity21 , but @entity81 has more realistic goals this time around			1
" @entity68 is obviously a great player and a recognizable star , " he explains			0
" i think that 's the type of player we 're looking for			0
" we also know that we have to have a sustainable model			0
we ca n't over spend , we ca n't bring in 11 superstars right now , that 's not going to do anybody any good			0
we like our roster now and we like who we are , every team is always evolving			2
" @entity177 is one of @entity68 's new teammates and a genuine @entity35			0
the defender boasts a respectable pedigree within @entity12 soccer and is a veteran of six years with the @entity105			2
despite the weight of history on his new team 's shoulders , @entity177 is relishing the chance to represent a club with such an illustrious name			2
" it 's an honor , " insists the 32 - year - old			0
" we can never duplicate that			0
you 're never going to match that team , some of the best players in the world			1
" hopefully we can play attractive soccer , something the fans can be proud of and we can bring some championships back to @entity35			0
that 's our main focus starting august 3			0
" @entity177 is part of a team which has been brought together in little over two months by the @entity16 ' hierarchy , with coach @entity134 at the heart of the effort			1
the @entity210 was a journeyman striker in the @entity80 , best known for a prolific two - year spell with the @entity105 between 1996 and 1998			0
he has a team at his disposal which boasts a @entity118 champion , but also contains players looking for a second chance at a football career			2
" we are very satisfied with what we 're building right now , with the players and the family we 're creating at the @entity16 , " says the former @entity210 international			1
" i 'm having fun			0
i think this is a great job , with a great organization with a great name			0
we do n't have time to think about pressure , we just have to keep working and make sure we build a new future			2
" what the future holds for the @entity16 is uncertain			1
could the club one day join the @entity105 in the @entity80 ? " it 's possible , " answers @entity81			0
" we do n't know			0
there are no discussions right now			0
there 's no animosity between the groups			0
" we just do things one way and @entity80 does them differently			0
you never know how things will grow and change over time			2
" after 30 years in the doldrums , the @entity16 are happy enough just being back on the field .			1
