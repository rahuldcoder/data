another death row inmate , @entity26 , scheduled to be executed in coming weeks , also was granted a reprieve until at least april 2010			0
the conflicting moves came after the botched execution attempt of @entity30 last month , which raised serious questions about the state 's lethal injection procedures			1
" additional time is needed to fully conduct a thorough and comprehensive review of an alternative or backup lethal injection protocol that is in accordance with @entity3 law , " @entity24 said in his announcement			1
no explanation was offered on why @entity3 's executive branch switched its official position in such a short period of time			2

the 6th @entity21 @entity50 in @entity51 had blocked @entity23 ' execution monday , citing problems accessing @entity55 's veins in a failed execution attempt last month			1
technicians tried for two hours on september 15 to find suitable veins to insert the chemicals			0

" given the important constitutional and humanitarian issues at stake in all death penalty cases , these problems in the @entity3 lethal injection protocol are certainly worthy of meaningful consideration , " wrote judge @entity75			0
" why assume an execution protocol is unconstitutional when one of the humane features of the protocol -- that the state will not continue trying to access a usable vein beyond a sensible time limit -- is being followed ? "			0
