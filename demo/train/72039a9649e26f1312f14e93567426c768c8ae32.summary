-- in his first weeks as leader of the world 's most populous nation , @entity2 's new president @entity1 has made frequent reference to an emergent " @entity7 , " emphasizing prosperity , happiness , and a revitalized national ethos			1
no doubt economic growth and infrastructure have been common themes in @entity2 's national rhetoric			1
but as national pride rises in lockstep with economic growth , the added emphasis on a culturally based " unity of purpose " raises a new question : as @entity2 overcomes centuries of foreign intrusion and humiliation to emerge as a superpower , what will be the role of @entity28 ? @entity2 has become not only a global center of economic gravity , but also a demographic magnet			1
historically , great empires have been ethnically diverse and racially inclusive , absorbing talent from all corners to drive collective success			0
in short , they have been melting pots			0
@entity1 : @entity2 's new boss a man with a dream @entity2 's history has hardly been linear or peaceful when it comes to its inter-ethnic relations and openness to the outside world			1
two thousand years ago , @entity46 came to @entity2 via the @entity47 , absorbing @entity49 monks and missionaries			1
the 13th century @entity47 traveler @entity51 spent 17 years serving in the @entity53 court of @entity54			0
but @entity2 has also sought to be left alone			1
the @entity55 was built and rebuilt many times since the @entity57 ( 221 @entity58 ) to fend off @entity60 invasions			0
were it not for the 19th century @entity62 and perception of @entity66 and other @entity65 ' mercantile exploitation of the country for silver , it would have been even more difficult to unite its disparate regional power centers against " foreign devils			0
" @entity2 continued to suffer foreign occupation , notably by the @entity72 during @entity73 , but after its own civil war rapidly undertook a process of territorial consolidation			1
its western expansion led to the pacification of diverse ethnicities , creating today 's @entity81 lange of the dominant @entity82 , but also @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity60 , and other ethnic groups			0

it was @entity97 who set the country on its present seemingly irreversible course of globalization			0
in the 1970s and 1980s , thousands of foreign investors and managers came to run factories taking advantage of @entity2 's enormous labor pool			2
the outsourcing of manufacturing to @entity2 brought capital , technology , and knowledge that the country needed			2
now that @entity2 has become one of the most trade - dependent nations , openness is no longer an option			2
it is easier than ever to visit and reside in @entity2 , but do foreigners see themselves staying in @entity2 for a long time ? and how " @entity2 " can they become ? @entity120 is used to being the land of opportunity for immigrants , but it is has also become a source of economic migrants , particularly since the financial crisis			1
over 6 million @entity120 now reside abroad , the highest number ever recorded , and the proportion of @entity120 aged 18 to 24 who plan to move abroad has risen from 12 to 40 % since 2007			0
ever more young @entity120 are turning up in @entity2 , living cheap , learning @entity2 , hustling for jobs , and diligently traveling @entity131			2
at a lecture last year at @entity135 's prestigious @entity134 , i heard from dozens of @entity136 who turned down spots in ma programs in the @entity120 and @entity65 in order to get a dual - language @entity141 in @entity2 -- with guaranteed summer internships and great networking opportunities with multinationals and @entity2 businesses			2
across the board , young westerners i have met in @entity2 came here on one - way tickets			2
read more : @entity2 companies ' rent ' white foreigners from executives in @entity93 , @entity154 and @entity155 to diplomats and intellectuals in @entity135 , @entity2 has become a country that scholars , journalists , and entrepreneurs are settling in for the long haul			1
@entity163 , a @entity164 political philosopher and long - time @entity2 resident who lectures intellectual and @entity167 elites in fluent @entity168 , points out that while @entity2 has become home to a global talent pool , with thousands of foreigners arriving each year with a great desire to learn about @entity2 culture , " there is no expectation that they will become ' real ' @entity2			1
" no matter how well foreigners learn @entity2 , they can not dissolve their original cultural traits the way many immigrants in @entity120 do within just a single generation			1
perhaps that is part of the appeal : if one can never be truly " @entity2 , " then being in @entity2 is always exotic			1
no doubt , there are high - profile cases of @entity2 fleeing their own country , from the blind dissident @entity190 to ultra-high net worth individuals parking cash abroad			2
some expatriates who had devoted their own careers to @entity2 have also packed up and left , citing air pollution , lack of free press , and intimidation after speaking their minds			2
companies fed up with the theft of their intellectual property now do not locate their most sensitive research and development operations in @entity2			2
but still , the number of foreigners in @entity2 has crossed one million and continues to rise			1
their presence has sparked debates about inclusion and xenophobia , welfare and generosity , democracy and free speech			0
much like long - term residents of @entity215 and @entity216 , @entity2 too blame migrants ( both internal and foreign ) for crowded streets and rising crime , but also realize that migrants are the ones who often collect the trash and do the laundry			2
they also help @entity2 businesses reach the rest of the world more efficiently			0
each year , more than 200,000 @entity228 travel to @entity229 , 200 miles west of @entity154 , to purchase wholesale goods for sale across the @entity233 world			0
everything " made in @entity2 " is conveniently available in the city 's giant @entity236 expo halls			0
the city is now a major hub on the new @entity47 as @entity2 has risen to become the @entity228 's largest trade partner			0
higher up the value chain , @entity2 in cosmopolitan @entity135 and @entity154 also appreciate the role foreigners have played in the country 's rise			1
as one @entity135 native working for an @entity120 university put it , " we admire foreigners because they represent advanced technology and management expertise ; we can learn from them			0
" @entity2 has made the recruitment of the global " best and brightest " an official policy , and not just the " sea turtles " ( hai gui ) of whom more than 500,000 have returned after studying abroad , and now account for half of @entity2 companies ' launching on the @entity120 stock exchange			1
reversing brain drain is not enough			0
recently the government has launched its own " green card " program ( casually dubbed the " red card " ) , granting permanent residency to growing numbers of foreigners			0
as a next generation of leaders with international educations rise in business and government , they are recruiting their talented classmates to come to @entity2 , pointing to a continuity of openness to foreign expertise			0
much as @entity2 welcomed @entity276 in the 16th and 17th centuries that transferred scientific knowledge to the @entity280 and @entity281 dynasties , businessmen , scholars , scientists , and non-governmental organizations are welcome today if they help to improve productivity , innovation , supply chain standards , or bring affordable technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions			0
for foreigners using @entity2 as a base , residency access is becoming like the @entity2 rmb currency : flexible and convertible			1
but as with the currency , such liberalization takes time and careful management			0
to thrive , one must not only learn @entity168 but adopt some @entity2 views , such as prizing social stability over rapid political reform			0
@entity2 also do n't want foreigners to get too native			1
according to one @entity2 entrepreneur , " just because you might learn @entity168 fluently , we do n't like seeing westerners haggling abrasively in restaurants and bazaars			0
these are @entity2 habits , often crude ones , but when foreigners do them it comes across as exploitation , which we resent			1
" the foreign population of @entity2 wo n't rise over 1 % for many years , a mere drop in the ocean of 1.4 billion people			0
and like @entity72 , @entity2 is a country where foreigners will never be considered locals even if they adopt local customs			1
rather than a melting pot then , @entity2 is more of a salad bowl in which foreigners are a mere sprinkling of pepper			1
still , foreigners are considered an essential part of achieving the " @entity7			1

@entity330 : everywhere you look in urban @entity2 , you see foreigners : traders , *merchants* , students
@entity2 has become a global center of economic gravity and a demographic magnet
foreigners are considered an essential part of achieving the ' @entity7 '
