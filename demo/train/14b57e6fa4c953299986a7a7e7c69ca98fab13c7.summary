-- @entity3 has rescinded its invitation for a @entity6 envoy to visit the secretive nation to discuss the fate of @entity9 , a @entity10 - @entity6 man who is being held there , a @entity2 official said sunday			1
@entity9 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , was arrested in november 2012 in @entity13 , along @entity3 's northeastern coast			1
@entity15 sentenced him last year to 15 years of hard labor , accusing him of planning to bring down the government through religious activities			0
he is widely reported to have been carrying out christian missionary work in @entity3			0
@entity9 , 45 , operated a @entity21 - based company specializing in tours of @entity3 , according to his family , who have described him as a devout @entity24			1
no reason was given for the trip cancellation			0
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity27 expressed disappointment that ambassador @entity30 's visit was called off and noted @entity3 had said it would n't use @entity9 as a " political bargaining trip			1
" this is the second time @entity3 has canceled a planned visit by @entity30			1
@entity9 was moved to a hospital last year after his health deteriorated			0
but last week the @entity6 said he had been moved back to a labor camp , a development his family described as " devastating			0
" " we again call on the @entity3 to grant @entity9 special amnesty and immediate release as a humanitarian gesture so he may reunite with his family and seek medical care , " @entity27 said sunday			2
" we will continue to work actively to secure mr. @entity9 's release			2
" the rev. @entity44 , the @entity6 civil rights leader , has offered , at the request of @entity9 's family , to " travel to @entity15 on a humanitarian mission focused on @entity9 's release , " @entity27 added			1
she said that annual joint military exercises by @entity6 and @entity10 forces , due to begin later this month , are " in no way linked to mr. @entity9 's case			1
" tensions over exercises the large military drills anger the nuclear - armed @entity3 regime , which says it views them as a prelude to an invasion			1
last year , @entity15 's threatening rhetoric reached alarming levels during the exercises , heightening tensions in the region			2
@entity3 has been urging the @entity10 not to take part in the drills -- a call that @entity67 and @entity12 have rejected			2
this year 's exercises , involving thousands of @entity6 and @entity10 troops , will begin february 24 , @entity68 said monday			1
one of the exercises , @entity72 , in which about 5,200 @entity6 troops will participate , will run until march 6			0
the @entity6 military says @entity72 makes sure forces are prepared to defend @entity10 and trains them to " respond to any potential event on the peninsula			2
" the other exercise , @entity80 , in which about 7,500 @entity6 troops will take part , continues until april 18			0
@entity80 , according to the @entity6 military , is " a series of joint and combined field training exercises " that combine ground , air , naval , expeditionary and special operations			0
@entity68 said the @entity3 's @entity87 had been informed of the dates of the exercises and of " the non-provocative nature of this training			0
" the dates of the drills overlap with planned reunions of families in @entity96 who were separated by the @entity98 in the 1950s			0
the reunions of about 200 people -- 100 from each country -- are scheduled to take place between february 20 and 25 at a resort on the @entity3 's side of the heavily militarized border			2
but @entity15 said last week it may back out of the arrangement -- as it has in the past -- if @entity10 goes ahead with the joint military drills with the @entity6			1
@entity0 's @entity109 and @entity110 contributed to this report .			0
