local media have n't covered this issue much , but @entity1 have a word for it : " epal , " @entity34 for someone butting in where not needed			1
it could also describe the act of politicians grandstanding for political gain during a disaster			1
the debate over this has ballooned online among @entity1 and the diaspora			1
as these images have garnered so much attention , we wanted to clarify what we know about them and what we have left to decipher			0

how to help @entity4 survivors @entity78 , a spokesman for the @entity79 , said he had seen some evidence that politicians were getting involved in the delivery of aid			1
" i 've seen vans or small pickup trucks distributing small - scale aid with a politician 's face on the side , " he said from the hard - hit city of @entity85			2
" we do n't need or want to see the politicization of aid			2
we want the aid to go where it is needed most			2
" however , he added that first responders like the ones he witnessed should n't be dismissed out of hand			0
" you 've got to remember , they are bringing in relief that is needed , and that keeps people going until the more sustained effort picks up			2
" it does n't obstruct us , but we do need to ensure that relief is well - coordinated with local , regional and national authorities			2
we do n't want to load up a truck with supplies for 1,000 families and find that someone else has come in this morning			0
" one of three politicians coming under fire is @entity1 vice president @entity117			1
photos posted on @entity14 show @entity117 's face on a tarp on the back of a truck and the vice president 's logo on blue drawstring bags of relief goods			1

the @entity161 , @entity1 , native shared a series of photos that have circulated widely online			1
" they take advantages of ' helping ' by putting their names on the relief goods			2
it 's a very strategic way in putting their name on the donations or any forms of assistance to advertise their name for the next election			0
" however , @entity127 explained that these labeled relief bags came from a local partner in @entity179			0
" these bags were donated by a supporter of the vice president from @entity179 and did not come from the @entity183 , " he said			0
