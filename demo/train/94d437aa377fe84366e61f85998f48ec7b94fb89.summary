-- it was a tough job , but someone had to do it			2
34 - year - old @entity6 @entity5 , winner of @entity7 's " @entity5 " competition has now completed his six - month stint looking after @entity9 on @entity11 's @entity10			1
having to cope with turquoise waters , miles of white sandy beaches and more sunshine than most brits see in a decade of summers must have given him sleepless nights ? surprisingly , they did n't , but the job was more strenuous than at first it might appear			2
@entity5 points out that the competition advertised in the world 's press said the winner would have to " feed the fish , clean the pool , deliver the mail and watch the whales			1
" but during the interview process he says it became clear to him and other applicants that it was going to be a full - on job with lots of interviews and writing			1
" every day i 've gone to a new island and explored what 's on offer there			2
then i 've sat down in the evenings and usually worked quite late putting videos and photos together and writing blogs			2
that 's the key part of it , " @entity5 told @entity0			1
and with 300 islands in his section of @entity10 he was clearly kept busy			1
but as he readily admits being paid nearly $ 140,000 to look after an island has been an amazing experience			0
" i think i 've done more in these six months than i 've done in the previous 34 years of my life			2
to be able to do this sort of thing , in this location , and report on it ca n't really be classed as work , " he said			0
but there was one moment of trouble in paradise shortly before @entity60			1
after enjoying a jet ski ride @entity5 joyfully leapt off the back and into the water only to be stung by a deadly @entity64			1
a fever rapidly engulfed him before doctors were able to ease his symptoms			0
" for six hours i was pretty bad , " he recalled			0
" next morning however , after i had my morphine , i came through the other side			0
" so now that his work is done on the island , where does he intend to go on holiday ? " it 's a difficult one that , " he says , " but the @entity60 that the @entity76 enjoyed almost made me a bit jealous			1
" despite the allure of distant snow @entity5 says he will probably take a holiday in the southern hemisphere			1
" i 've discovered a few parts of @entity83 and a few places dotted along there that i would go back and relax on			0
" he says the hardest part of leaving the island has been moving out of his $ 4 million villa			0
" i lived on top of a @entity89 as i drove round @entity90 on a charity expedition in 2008			0
so i went from living in a tent to living in this amazing house			0
closing the door on the @entity95 [ the villa ] was probably the toughest bit			0
