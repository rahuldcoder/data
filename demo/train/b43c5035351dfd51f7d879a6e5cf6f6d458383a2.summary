@entity0 -- @entity2 can continue to receive @entity4 funding in @entity5 , after the @entity7 @entity6 denied an appeal by the state on tuesday			1
the justices let stand a lower court decision that had blocked patient reimbursement through @entity4 for health providers that perform abortions as part of overall medical care			1
that would include private groups like @entity2 that fund its abortion care independently			2
@entity2 said it served 85,000 patients statewide in 2011			0
of those , 5,580 received abortions , but most were given basic reproductive health care , including contraceptives and health screenings			1
a federal appeals court last year permanently blocked enforcement of the @entity5 law , ruling that @entity4 regulations clearly give program participants the power to select their own qualified health care provider			1
@entity5 officials asked the @entity6 to intervene , but the justices declined without comment			0
@entity4 is a nationwide health program for low - income patients that is funded primarily by the federal government but administered by the states			2
federal law bans @entity4 funds to pay for abortions in most instances , but @entity5 's law went further			1
the measure specifically blocked the @entity5 @entity46 from signing contracts with any group performing abortions , with the exception of hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers			0
the controversial law was allowed to go into effect in 2011 by a federal judge hours after it was approved by then - gov. @entity55			0
in signing the bill , @entity55 and other state officials said other options existed for @entity4 patients seeking reproductive health care			1
but the appeals court later weighed in and reversed it			2
there was no immediate reaction to the high court denial from current @entity5 gov. @entity66			0
but @entity2 , which bills itself as the " nation 's leading sexual and reproductive health care provider and advocate , " applauded the move			1
" over and over again , courts have said that states can not block people from getting preventive health care at @entity2 , and the vast majority of the @entity7 public agrees , " said @entity71 , president of the nonprofit 's @entity72			1
the funding issue is not isolated to @entity5			0
courts around the country have blocked similar laws aimed at @entity2 in @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity87			0
but the group has experienced legal setbacks in @entity90 and @entity91			0
the high court cases are @entity2 of @entity5 v. secretary of the @entity95 and @entity94 ( 12 - 1159 ) ; and secretary of the @entity95 and @entity94 v. @entity2 of @entity5 ( 12 - 1039 ) .			2
