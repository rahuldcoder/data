as newly picked @entity2 czar @entity1 gets started , some are wondering if @entity3 could also use a new surgeon general			1
as @entity6 criticize the @entity9 administration 's appointment of @entity1 , democrats are intensifying their push for a vote on the delayed nomination of dr. @entity13 for surgeon general			1
" given the public 's increasing fears regarding the spread of the disease , it is imperative that we confirm a surgeon general who will play a significant role in educating the @entity3 public about the disease and how to best protect their health , " write @entity15			1
@entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 and dozens of other @entity30 @entity5 in a letter being sent this week to senate majority leader @entity32 and minority leader @entity33			2
" the @entity3 public would benefit from having a surgeon general to disseminate information that is desperately needed			1
" @entity13 , a doctor and entrepreneur from @entity37 , was nominated last fall after vice admiral @entity38 stepped down			1
his pick ran into controversy because of some of his political advocacy and statements saying guns are a health care issue			0
in 2008 he co-founded a group doctors for @entity9 which backed @entity9 's campaign and his push for health care reform			0
the group later was re-named doctors for @entity3 , which advocated for some gun control measures			0
in an editorial thursday the @entity54 said : " it 's a bad time to be without a surgeon general ; dismayingly , @entity9 's appointment of dr. @entity13 of @entity59 sank earlier this year because of [ @entity61 ] opposition			1
but the president needs a confidence - inspiring figure to lead and explain the nation 's @entity2 efforts â € ” or should be prepared to step into that role himself			0
" as the editorial notes , the nomination stalled after the @entity61 in february wrote to @entity32 and @entity70 saying it " strongly " opposed @entity13			2
" given dr. @entity13 's lengthy history of hostility towards the right to keep and bear arms , " the @entity61 said " there is little reason to believe that he would not work to further a gun control agenda if confirmed as surgeon general			1
" how much difference would a confirmed surgeon general make in the @entity2 response ? currently there is an acting surgeon general , rear admiral @entity85 , but he has not taken a major public role during this crisis			1
the job of surgeon general is not known as one of the most powerful health care positions in the administration			2
he or she reports to an assistant secretary of health , does not directly supervise any of the agencies responsible for dealing with the @entity2 outbreak but does oversee a group of 6,800 uniformed public health professionals working for the government			0
" it was stripped of its power in the 1960 's , " said author @entity103 describing the power of office of the surgeon general			1
" since then the surgeon general has been a health educator , a spokesman			2
it has been up to the government how much reign they want to give that person , " @entity103 , author of the book " surgeon general 's warning : how politics crippled the @entity119 , " added			1
in some past recent health crises either the @entity120 and / or the head of the @entity122 have been the frontline spokesmen for the government			0
so far @entity120 secretary @entity125 , who took over in june , has not publicly stepped out as a public voice of the government 's response			0
she did one round of the network morning shows last week			0
@entity122 director dr. @entity131 instead has appeared on many television shows and been most commonly the administration 's choice for briefing the public on the status of the @entity2 outbreak in the @entity3 known as the " nation 's doctor , " a confirmed surgeon general could fill a void as the administration 's face on @entity2 although as some former officials have said the office does n't have much direct responsibility and is rather weak			1
the @entity30 says however it would n't hurt			0
" in terms of what role the surgeon general would play in this specific response , i guess what i would say about that is it 's hard to imagine it would hurt , and that we would only benefit from a scenario where we had a dedicated public health professional who was involved in helping us communicate with hospitals and medical professionals all across the country to ensure that these protocols , the proper protocols , were in place and closely followed , " @entity30 press secretary @entity148 said last week			2
some of those who have served in the job also said they had helped with government preparedness in past crises			0
" as surgeon general i was involved in a lot of the training , education , working with my colleagues at [ @entity177 ] and @entity122 to ramp up after 9/11 to ensure we had the best preparedness programs in place which included bio agents			2
the problem is after these things happen , our memories start to fade			0
our government stops to fund programs			0
research is not as robust as it should be and so on , so there 's a rippling effect that goes out , " dr. @entity187 , who served in the job in the @entity190 administration , told @entity195 's " @entity194 " last week			2
@entity103 said some of the most successful recent surgeon generals were independent and " were willing to say what they thought the truth was even if it was n't according to the script of the @entity30			1
" he specifically pointed to doctors who took prominent positions on issues which were not directly related to ongoing health care crises -- @entity206 , who spoke out about smoking and @entity207 and @entity208 , who was very public about her views on sexuality .			0

dr. @entity13 has been *awaiting* confirmation to be the next surgeon general since last fall .
rear admiral @entity85 is the acting surgeon general .
one author said the position was stripped of its real power in the 1970s .
that same author says the most successful surgeon generals have been those that can speak out .
