-- nine - man @entity1 lost 3 - 2 to @entity3 in a pulsating and controversial top - of - the - table @entity5 clash at @entity7 sunday			1
it was the first league defeat of the season for the @entity10 , who hold a slender one point lead in the standings after nine games over second - placed @entity3 and defending champions @entity15			1
the score was tied at 2 - 2 just after the hour mark when @entity18 was shown a straight red for pulling down @entity20 after he was played through by @entity21			1
there could be few arguments with referee @entity25 's decision but six minutes later @entity26 was shown his second yellow card in highly controversial circumstances			1
he pushed the ball through the legs of @entity3 defender @entity31 but went down spectacularly as he went past him -- replays indicated he had been clipped by the @entity34			2
@entity25 ruled it was a deliberate dive and the @entity37 international trudged off , his manager @entity38 shaking his head in disagreement			0
soon afterwards , @entity3 boss @entity41 was seen remonstrating with his @entity1 counterpart , but his anger turned to joy when his second half substitute @entity45 reacted quickly to turn home a @entity48 cross shot			1
to add to @entity1 's sense of injustice , television replays appeared to indicate the @entity52 had come back from an offside position to score the winner			2
later sunday , @entity1 said they had made a formal complaint against referee @entity25 , accusing him of using " inappropriate language " to two of their players			1
a club spokesman said : " we have lodged a complaint to the @entity5 match delegate with regards to inappropriate language used by the referee and directed to two of our players in two separate incidents in today 's match			1
" the visitors had been two goals ahead inside 12 minutes as @entity73 's early shot rebounded off a post to hit @entity75 and dribble over the line			0
@entity77 @entity73 then connected with an @entity79 cross to make it 2 - 0			1
but back came the leaders with @entity83 stroking home a free kick just before the half time break			2
they came out in inspired form at the start of the second half and @entity90 picked out fellow @entity92 @entity91 to head the equalizer			0
@entity1 looked the more likely side to go on to take three points before the red cards changed the course of the match			2
@entity41 believed @entity26 was at fault for his own sending off			2
" did he intend to dive ? i thought he went down , " he told @entity101			0
" i think @entity31 may have just caught him a little bit but he can either carry on running -- which he could have done -- but he chose to go down			0
" he could have carried on and scored so i can not understand it			0
it 's his own fault			0
" in the early kick off , @entity108 had led @entity110 2 - 0 in the @entity112 derby before the home side hit back to salvage a draw			1
@entity116 international @entity115 was at the center of the action , his early shot deflecting off @entity120 to produce the opening goal			0
his celebration raised eyebrows as he ran and dived full - length in front of @entity110 manager @entity125 in response to his remarks about him earlier in the week			2
@entity115 then headed home @entity130 's free kick to put @entity108 in command but the home side were quick to respond			0
@entity133 and @entity134 were on the score sheet to stun @entity137 ' men			0
@entity115 thought he had scored the winner in injury time as he lashed his shot high into the net , but it was controversially ruled out for offside			0
@entity143 moved into fourth place in the standings with a 2 - 1 win at struggling @entity147 with @entity148 , returning to his old side , putting the visitors ahead after 15 minutes			1
@entity151 added the second but @entity147 hit back after the break through a @entity155 goal			0
@entity156 hit an injury time winner for @entity158 as they beat @entity159 2 - 1 in the day 's other match in the @entity5 .			1

@entity3 beat @entity1 3 - 2 at @entity7
