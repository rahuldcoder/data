-- a federal appeals court has stayed the @entity3 execution of a convicted rapist and murderer , saying that his defense team should have more time to make their case that @entity8 is intellectually disabled			1
@entity8 's execution had been scheduled for tuesday			1
it would have been the first execution in the @entity12 since a botched lethal injection in @entity14 left an inmate writhing in pain before death			2
his defense team now will have more time to appeal his death sentence			2
" it is regrettable that we are now reviewing evidence of intellectual disability at the eleventh hour before @entity8 's scheduled execution			1
however , from the record before us , it appears that we can not fault @entity8 or his attorneys , present or past , for the delay , " justices from the @entity27 said in their opinion			0
a neuropsychologist had diagnosed @entity8 with " mild mental retardation			1
" his attorneys say that makes him ineligible for the death penalty			0
but @entity3 prosecutors say their efforts are a last - ditch effort to stop execution and not a valid claim			0
in 2002 , the @entity12 @entity43 concluded " the mentally retarded should be categorically excluded from execution			0
" @entity3 attorney general @entity50 , in a petition contesting the defense claims of mental retardation before the appeals court 's ruling , questioned why @entity8 , now 41 , waited until 12 years after a court had determined his mental state to raise the claims			1
" @entity8 's last - minute claim of mental retardation , which was previously raised and rejected in the federal and state courts does not warrant review			1
@entity8 is not mentally retarded , " according to pertinent case law , @entity50 contends			0
@entity8 's lawyer praised the appeals court 's decision , arguing that @entity3 should stop pursuing the death penalty in the case			1
" @entity68 's decision today creates an opportunity for @entity3 to rise above its past mistakes and seek a resolution of this matter that will better serve the interests of all parties and the public , " attorney @entity65 said in a statement			0
according to court documents and the @entity77 , @entity8 was involved in a string of armed carjackings in 1990 and 1991			2
in one incident , @entity80 , a 20 - year - old @entity81 bank employee , was snatched from a gas station , robbed , sexually assaulted and fatally shot			0
" mr. @entity8 gave ms. @entity80 's coat to his mother , and her jewelry to his girlfriend , as gifts ; he also drove ms. @entity80 's car openly in his own neighborhood , and told people he had been involved in the crime , " according to his application for post-conviction relief			2
these facts are key , as the defense team says they indicate that " mr. @entity8 demonstrates no criminal sophistication			1
" questions about competence testing showed @entity8 had " applied academic skills consistent with an individual midway through fifth grade , " according to court documents , and while he was able to count and add change , he was inconsistent " calculating change from a purchase			1
" he also asked a friend for help reading a non-digital watch , and an informant told the court @entity8 could not read a car 's gas gauge and " always had to ask others whether there was enough fuel to get to the destination , " the documents say			1
dr. @entity121 , a clinical neuropsychologist , diagnosed @entity8 with " mild mental retardation , " saying his performance on recent tests was consistent with his standardized intelligence test scores when he was a child , according to court documents			1
@entity8 's defense team alleges the @entity77 was aware of @entity8 's low test scores , yet told the team in 2003 that his only iq test yielded a score of 84 , well above the threshold range for mental retardation			1
but as judge @entity135 wrote last week in her dissent to the @entity138 ' 5 - 4 decision , a defense team later learned the @entity77 administered a test in 1992 , on which @entity8 scored a 71			1
@entity135 described it as " a score that , after applying the standard of margin of error , would indicate mental retardation			2
" had the department not " misinformed " @entity8 's defense , the judge wrote , " then this court would have had iq testing supportive of applicant 's mental - retardation claim			1
" also influencing the dissent is that @entity121 had deemed the 1990 test score of 84 " unreliable			0
" " this court should not base its decisions that determine whether a person will live or be executed based on misinformation or wholly inadequate information , " @entity135 concluded in her dissent			0
questions over execution drug mixes @entity8 's attorneys have also challenged the method by which @entity3 intends to execute @entity8			1
the constitutionality of lethal injection drugs and drug cocktails has made headlines since last year , when @entity168 manufacturers -- including @entity170 - based @entity169 , which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned @entity12 prisons from using their drugs in executions			2
many states were left to find new drug protocols			0
@entity8 's defense cites last month 's botched execution in @entity14 , in which a three - drug cocktail was used to to try to put to death convicted murderer @entity180			1
the provenance of the drugs was shielded by @entity14 law			0
@entity180 reportedly twitched , spoke and writhed in pain for about 40 minutes before dying of a massive heart attack			0
death row inmate @entity186 was scheduled to die in @entity14 the same day , but the execution was postponed			2
the @entity188 last week extended the stay until november 13			0
" we are very pleased that the ( attorney general ) agrees at least 6 months is necessary before any execution in @entity14 can take place , given the need for a full investigation to be conducted into @entity180 's agonizing botched execution , and the @entity199 ' own recognition that protocol revisions and extensive retraining are necessary , " @entity186 's attorney , @entity197 , said			0
in @entity8 's case , @entity3 intends to use pentobarbital , and @entity8 's lawyers point out that the drug is no longer available in regulated form and can be obtained only via so - called " compounding pharmacies , " which operate outside of @entity209 oversight			1
arguing @entity180 was " subjected to a torturous execution that undeniably violated his @entity213 " rights , the defense says that pentobarbital also poses concerns after @entity14 inmate @entity216 complained during a january execution , " i feel my whole body burning			0
" @entity3 ' @entity221 also complained of a burning sensation during his april execution , and he was executed " using compounded pentobarbital from the same batch intended for mr. @entity8 , " the defense 's appeal says			2
@entity8 's attorneys say @entity3 ' refusal to disclose the " source , efficacy and potency " of the drug raises issues similar to those in @entity14			2
it 's not about which drugs are used , @entity8 's defense wrote in its appeal , but about the transparency of the entire process			2
the @entity77 , in its response , said that the drug that is to be used has " been independently tested at 108 % potency and is free of contaminants			0
@entity77 has successfully carried out , without incident , seven previous executions with pentobarbital from a different compounding pharmacy and three with pentobarbital from the same source as will be used in @entity8 's execution			1
" " what the events in @entity14 have made clear is that the risk of torture and a clearly cruel and unusual outcome has been proved to be a very real threat when states are n't required to facilitate executions with the transparency and accountability and disclosure of the sort sought -- and denied -- in @entity14 , " the court document says			0
" in short , the events in @entity14 have made clear that the risk of inhumane executions is substantial , including in @entity3			0
" @entity267 suggests fixes for death penalty in @entity12 opinion : it 's time to televise executions @entity0 's @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 contributed to this report .			0
