@entity0 as the subject of a @entity4 roast ? the @entity0 who allegedly egged a neighbor 's house ? the @entity0 who reportedly antagonized an airplane crew and filled an plane with pot smoke ? the @entity0 whose antics prompted some commentators to ask for his deportation ? @entity4 might have a hard time coming up with material			1
but seriously , folks , it looks like the @entity0 will be put on the spit at one of @entity4 's periodic skewerings -- and he could n't be happier , the singer and recently minted @entity23 model tweeted			2
nor could a host of people on the @entity26 , who made the hashtag # @entity28 -- spurred on by @entity4 -- start trending			0
of course , given the youthfulness of @entity0 's fans , more than one tweeter politely took the time to explain just what a " roast " is			0
oh , if only @entity35 were still alive			0
the @entity0 roast is scheduled for march 7 .			1

@entity4 will roast singer @entity0 on march 7
# @entity40 hashtag *encourages* people to *suggest* jokes
