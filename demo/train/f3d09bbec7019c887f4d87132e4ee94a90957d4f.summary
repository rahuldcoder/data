-- @entity1 has dropped its lawsuit against @entity3 and the company the league claims provided performance - enhancing drugs to a number of players , including @entity10 star @entity9 , a league spokesman said tuesday			1
@entity12 , an @entity1 spokesman , said , " we have dismissed our biogenesis lawsuit			1
" that suit was filed in march against the @entity18 clinic and several men associated with it -- led by @entity3 -- for allegedly flouting the league 's drug prevention program , the pro sports league said			1
the lawsuit 's dismissal was n't entirely unexpected			2
@entity24 had reported that @entity1 might drop the suit against @entity26 if he cooperated in its investigation			2
the investigation led to the suspension of 14 players for violating the league 's drug policy			0
besides @entity9 , suspended players included @entity36 outfielder @entity35 , the 2011 @entity37			1
only one of the players challenged his suspension : @entity9			0
after he called out commissioner @entity42 and others in his appeal of a 211 - game ban , an arbitrator reduced it to 162 games and the postseason			0
the @entity10 third baseman sued @entity1 , @entity42 and the players ' union to get the ban overturned , claiming the league engaged in vigilante justice during its investigation of @entity3 and his @entity3 anti-aging clinic			1
but earlier this month , @entity9 abruptly dropped his suit and accepted his suspension			0
after a surge in home runs in the late 1980s and 1990s -- highlighted by @entity59 and @entity60 racing to break @entity62 ' single - season home run record in 1998 , followed three years later by @entity63 breaking the new record -- @entity1 was accused of not doing enough to recognize and combat the use of performance enhancing substances			0
the league , in conjunction with its players ' union , in recent years has beefed up its drug testing programs and penalties			0
a number of top - level and minor league players have been suspended as a result , including @entity78 standout @entity77 , for 50 games in 2009			0
@entity3 became part of the story publicly in late january 2013 , when the @entity82 reported that more than a dozen professional baseball players and other athletes had been named in records kept over several years by the clinic			2
two months later , @entity1 filed its lawsuit against the clinic in @entity18 's @entity89			1
its 14 - page complaint named @entity3 , its predecessor company and six individuals -- among them program director @entity3 , others at the company , someone who worked at a sports agency , a former @entity97 baseball player and a " self - proclaimed chemist " who supplied substances			2
according to @entity1 , the accused solicited players , supplied them with drugs and offered dosage recommendations to help them avoid testing positive for banned substances under the league 's program			1
" ( the defendants ) knowingly and intentionally caused and / or induced ... players to breach their contractual obligations under @entity1 's @entity112 and @entity113 , " the complaint said			1
@entity0 's @entity114 contributed to this report .			0
