usually , airstrikes , rebels seizing control of oil fields and refineries , plus a severe refugee crisis are a recipe for market panic			1
that is the situation unfolding in @entity9 , but without a spike in prices , even though energy companies are retrenching			1
there 's been a growing list of small and medium sized explorers who have suspended operations : @entity17 listed @entity18 , @entity19 based @entity20 and @entity21 , known as @entity21 here in the @entity23			0
@entity24 , a major oil company , is trimming non-essential staff and others will likely do the same			0
@entity27 , an early mover in the @entity29 , said the situation is not good , but after fortifying their facilities , production is holding steady at 25,000 barrels a day			0
what we have now , after the initial panic when @entity35 made its move into @entity9 , are two distinct camps : explorers suspending operations and producers battening down the hatches and producing as best they can			1
according to the @entity44 , supplies up north are still above 300,000 barrels a day			0
tucked into the @entity46 's latest monthly report is one of today 's harsher realities : @entity35 has taken control of seven fields , which typically produce about 80 thousand barrels a day			2
energy and security sources here in the region tell me that oil is starting to find its way onto the black market , offered at a heavy discount			1
beyond the fighting , other complex problems still exist that could easily tilt the balance in @entity9			2
in @entity68 , near the country 's center , 300,000 barrels of refining capacity is off - line after @entity35 rebels fought for control , according to the @entity72 's @entity71			1
oil is being exported via pipeline from the @entity44 region through the @entity76 in @entity77			2
tankers have sailed , but @entity79 is blocking sales with an on - going dispute over who actually controls that oil			2
despite all that , @entity9 continues to supply the market with an ample level of crude			1
according to the @entity46 's monthly report , overall production is 3.1 million barrels a day , down slightly from the month before			0
exports are up again to 2.44 million and that is what the market is concentrating on			0
but there is a price to pay for the violence in the north and political in - fighting in @entity79			2
the country 's original target of expanding capacity to over 4 million barrels a day will be missed , according to @entity71			1
with this level of uncertainty , the international oil companies ( @entity102 ) may tighten their purse strings , waiting to see if the @entity107 intervention can help stabilize the country before committing more money for exploration and production			0
the big bounty for @entity9 and the energy majors remains the oil rich south around @entity116 which , despite initial security threats against international oil workers , is pumping and exporting crude at near record levels			1
@entity121 initially trimmed staff when @entity35 began its march into @entity9 , but at the end of july , ceo @entity124 went out of his way to assure investors production is back up to normal with plans for expansion			0
" the @entity131 field is now the second largest producing field in the world at about 1.4 million barrels per day , " said @entity124			0
" if you think about the map of @entity9 , it is down in the bottom of the funnel , near the @entity140 border , in the desert , in an unpopulated area			0
" @entity143 has put $ 4 billion into the @entity145 2 field in the south -- one of the world 's largest oil fields -- and despite initial delays is still producing 300,000 barrels a day without interruption			1
what we have learned in the past two months of fighting , is another harsh reality : money talks			0
@entity9 may have difficulty staying glued together as a country or even passing a petroleum law to govern revenue sharing , but securing production and distribution have been paramount			1
and that persistence earned the country $ 53 billion last month alone			0
@entity166 d more : @entity9 's ' new reality ' shakes global oil markets read more : why does the @entity107 intervene militarily in @entity9 but not in @entity170 ?			1

airstrikes , rebels seizing oil fields and a refugee crisis would normally spell market panic
but in @entity9 , which has dealing with all three issues , oil prices have remained steady
the militants *storming* the country 's north have not taken the country 's oil - rich south
and investment is still being pumped into the region , @entity188 writes
