@entity0 -- last month , secretary of homeland security @entity2 said the threat of terrorism to the @entity6 is at its " most heightened " since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks -- a threat that she asserted has taken on a new and disquieting form because of the growing emphasis by @entity13 terrorist groups on recruiting @entity6			2
@entity15 's warning came at the first in a series of hearings convened by the chairman of the @entity20 , rep. @entity21 , @entity23 - @entity22 , who is determined to investigate what he terms the radicalization of @entity28 - @entity27 communities , a problem he says is compounded by their lack of cooperation with law enforcement			1
the hearings , scheduled to begin in earnest thursday , have caused consternation among many @entity28 - @entity6 who worry that they will devolve into a @entity37 witch hunt			1
so , how real is the " homegrown " @entity13 terrorist threat ? the @entity39 and @entity41 's @entity40 examined the post- 9/11 cases of @entity6 or @entity6 residents convicted of or charged with some form of jihadist terrorist activity directed against the @entity6 , as well as the cases of @entity27 citizens who have traveled overseas to join a jihadist terrorist group			1
read the full report the number of such cases has certainly spiked in the past two years			0
in 2009 and 2010 , there were 76 , almost half of the total since 9/11			0
this increase was driven in part by plots that could have killed dozens , such as the attempt by @entity60 , a @entity61 , to bomb @entity62 in may			0
it was also driven by nine arrests in @entity66 sting operations and the 31 people who were charged with fundraising , recruiting or traveling abroad to fight for the @entity71 terrorist group @entity70			0
only four of the homegrown plots since 9/11 progressed to an actual attack in the @entity6 -- attacks that resulted in 17 deaths			2
the most notable was the 2009 shooting at @entity77 , @entity78 , in which maj. @entity79 allegedly killed 13 people			0
by way of comparison , 73 people were killed in hate crimes in the @entity6 between 2001 and 2009 , according to the @entity66			1
and more than 15,000 people are murdered in the @entity6 every year			2
none of the 175 individual jihadist terrorism cases we investigated involved plotting with chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear weapons			0
given all the post- 9/11 concerns about terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction , this is one of our more positive findings			2
the @entity6 military , fighting wars in two @entity28 countries , is firmly in the cross hairs of homegrown jihadist militants			1
around one - third of such cases involved a @entity6 military target , ranging from the @entity105 base in @entity106 , @entity107 , to @entity27 soldiers serving overseas			1
and in a third of the cases , the individuals involved were training on weapons or were manufacturing or acquiring weaponry			0
contrary to @entity21 's assertion that @entity28 - @entity27 communities have not cooperated with law enforcement , more than one - fifth of the post- 9/11 @entity13 terrorism cases originated with tips from @entity28 community members or involved the cooperation of the families of alleged plotters			1
( not included in our total were the tips from the local community that led to investigations into the disappearances of @entity71 - @entity27 youths in @entity130 to fight for @entity70 , because it is difficult to put an exact number on the cases affected by those tips			1
) tips from @entity28 communities and families warned authorities , for instance , about the danger posed by @entity141 , who was planning to attack the @entity106 base in 2009 , as well as the " d.c. 5 , " who tried to join militant groups in @entity145 the same year			2
a third of cases we surveyed involved the use of an informant , while a further one in 10 involved an undercover federal agent			0
( five cases involved both )			0
the large number of informants and undercover agents driving these cases raises the issue of how many of these arrests happened because the defendants were entrapped			0
while no one in a terrorism case since 9/11 has successfully used an entrapment defense , some of these cases certainly raise the specter of entrapment			2
for instance , in 2009 , a government informant promised $ 250,000 in cash and a @entity171 to a group of impoverished men if they would participate in a plot to attack synagogues in the @entity176 and an @entity178 base in @entity179 , @entity22			0
we also found that rather than being the uneducated , young @entity183 - @entity27 immigrants of popular imagination , the homegrown militants do not fit any particular socioeconomic or ethnic profile			1
their average age is 30			0
of the cases for which ethnicity could be determined , only a quarter are of @entity183 descent , while 13 % are @entity191 , 10 % are @entity27 , 18 % are @entity192 , 20 % are of @entity71 descent and the rest are either mixed race or of other ethnicities			0
about half the cases involved a @entity6 - born @entity27 citizen , while another third were naturalized citizens			1
and of the 94 cases where education could be ascertained , nearly two - thirds pursued at least some college courses , and one in 10 had completed a master 's degree , @entity206 or doctoral equivalent			0
the data on jihadist terrorism cases shows that there is a tiny but growing problem of militancy in the @entity214 community , but it also shows that the consequences of this are quite small			2
@entity21 has every right to investigate this phenomenon , but given the larger domestic problem of hate crimes , his committee would be well - served to focus on that issue as well			1
and the data shows that @entity28 - @entity27 communities may prove to be the congressman 's best ally in the fight against radicals in their midst			1
given that finding , the worst possible outcome of @entity21 's hearings would be to alienate the very constituency that is best - suited to root out the militants in their community .			1

rep. @entity21 wants to investigate the " radicalization " of @entity28 - @entity27 communities
*public* *policy* institute , school look at post- 9/11 homegrown @entity6 terrorism threats and crimes
@entity21 's panel should consider focusing on domestic problem of hate crimes as well , authors say
they say data shows that @entity28 - @entity27 communities may be @entity21 's best ally
