dr. @entity0 walked around the room at @entity2 on thursday , hugging staff members and shaking hands			1
it was like he wanted everyone to know : i 'm no longer infectious			0
the virus is out of my system			2
@entity10 did n't beat me			1
@entity0 and @entity11 , another @entity12 missionary infected with @entity10 in @entity13 , have been discharged from the hospital			1
@entity11 was released tuesday and is choosing not to make public comments , according to the hospital			1
" today is a miraculous day , " @entity0 said at a news conference thursday			2
" i am thrilled to be alive , to be well and to be reunited with my family			0
" what happens when you survive @entity10 ? @entity2 's staff is confident that the @entity12 patients ' discharges pose " no public health threat , " said dr. @entity25 , director of @entity2 's @entity26			1
he said the reason the public was not made aware of @entity11 's release immediately was that she requested her discharge not be publicly announced			2
" @entity11 is free of the virus , but the lingering effects of the battle have left her in a significantly weakened condition , " her husband , @entity31 , said in a statement			1
" thus , we decided it would be best to leave the hospital privately to be able to give her the rest and recuperation she needs at this time			2
" but @entity0 passed along gratitude from the woman with whom he has shared a harrowing journey			2
both patients were evacuated from @entity13 this month , in a plane specially equipped with an isolation tent , and accompanied by medical staff outfitted in head - to - foot protective clothing			1
the plane was able to take only one patient at a time and made two trips			0
the patients were taken to an isolation unit at @entity2 , where they 'd been treated for the last few weeks			2
as she walked out of her isolation room tuesday , @entity0 recalls @entity11 saying , " to @entity58 be the glory			1
" " we are tremendously pleased with dr. @entity0 and mrs. @entity11 's recovery , " @entity25 said at the news conference			1
" what we learned in caring for them will help advance the world 's understanding of how to treat @entity10 infections and help , hopefully , to improve survival " in other parts of the world			2
" there may be some recovery time because this is a fairly devastating disease , " but in general , @entity10 patients who survive without organ damage are expected to " make a complete recovery , " he said			1
@entity0 and @entity11 's releases are historic , says @entity81 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity80			1
they were the first humans with @entity10 to ever arrive in the @entity12			1
and they were the first humans to receive an experimental @entity10 drug called @entity85 , which may have saved their lives			1
treating ebola there is no known cure for @entity10 , no proven treatment and no vaccine			1
treatment consists of giving fluids , monitoring vital signs and responding to acute medical crises			0
symptoms include fever , aches , diarrhea and bleeding			0
left untreated , infections can be deadly in up to 90 % of cases			0
but around half the patients receiving medical care in the current outbreak in @entity13 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 are surviving			1
the ebola virus spreads via direct contact with bodily fluids , like blood , sweat and feces			1
for @entity10 patients to leave isolation , @entity25 said , two blood tests done in a two - day period must come back negative			1
there is a slight possibility that the virus could linger for up to three months in vaginal fluid and semen , according to the @entity122			0
@entity25 said that there is no evidence @entity10 has ever been transmitted in this way but that the risk was discussed with both patients			1
asked about the role the experimental drug may have played in their recoveries , @entity25 said doctors " do not know whether it helped them , whether it made no difference " or whether it might have delayed their recovery			1
@entity85 was also given to three health care workers -- two doctors and one nurse -- in @entity13			1
the nurse and one of the doctors have shown " a marked improvement , " according to the @entity122			0
the condition of the second doctor is " serious but has improved somewhat			0
" more human cases must be analyzed to determine whether the drug is having a significant effect or if it will help others in the region			0
but " according to the manufacturer , the very limited supplies of this experimental medicine are now exhausted , " the @entity122 said in a statement thursday			0
are they now immune to @entity10 ? a deadly outbreak more than 1,350 people have died in the @entity159 @entity10 outbreak since the first cases drew attention in march , the @entity122 said wednesday			2
aid workers are fighting an uphill battle to stop the disease as it continues to spread			0
financial and human resources have been stretched			0
an emergency research " all call " was issued thursday by medical charity @entity168 and the @entity170 's @entity169 to find a drug to stop the outbreak			0
they are making $ 10.8 million available to fund research			0
@entity168 is committing another $ 66.5 million to the development of health research scientists in @entity177 , who are studying many deadly diseases there			0
@entity181 's public health agency had 800 to 1,000 doses of a vaccine known as @entity184 delivered to health officials in @entity13 last week			2
it 's unclear if anyone has been given the vaccine			0
but there has been a glimmer of hope : the @entity122 has seen " encouraging signs " from @entity103 and @entity104 that positive action can rein in the deadly disease			0
the situation in @entity195 , @entity103 , where the country 's first case was detected in july , " looks reassuring , " the @entity122 said			0
" at present , the city 's 12 confirmed cases are all part of a single chain of transmission			0
those infected by the initial case include medical staff involved in his treatment , a patient in the same hospital , and a protocol officer in very close contact with the patient , " the organization said			0
one of those 12 has made a full recovery , the @entity122 said , which " counters the widespread perception that infection with the ebola virus is invariably a death sentence			1
" evidence suggests early detection and therapy can help people survive , it said			0
are myths making the @entity10 outbreak worse ?			2

dr. @entity0 and @entity11 have been discharged from an @entity227 hospital
doctors do n't know whether an experimental serum and a blood *transfusion* helped
both contracted the deadly ebola virus in @entity13
@entity0 and @entity11 are the first known @entity10 patients to recover in the @entity12
