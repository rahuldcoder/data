-- the @entity2 scandal keeps getting juicier			0
recent revelations , triggered by @entity6 employee @entity5 's earlier disclosures , indicate that the @entity2 not only collects volumes of metadata about the phone numbers people use , it routinely stores the contents of phone conversations , text messages , e-mails and internet activity			1
former vice president @entity16 explains that the collection of all of this information is crucial , because @entity6 staffers can not know what bits of it will turn out to be relevant to a counterterrorist investigation			1
in fact , the @entity24 has agreed with that argument in approving bulk collection of @entity28 as well as foreign metadata for the past seven years			2
and if metadata must be stored for this purpose , it is an easy step from there to conclude that the contents of communications must be stored as well			2
the key question then becomes when the @entity6 may " query " or identify the source of the metadata it has stored and read the communications it has collected			1
the @entity6 reports that it conducts queries of metadata only when it has a " reasonable , articulable " suspicion that a number is linked to a foreign threat that has been identified as such by the @entity24			1
@entity44 of the @entity45 , as amended in 2008 , limits looking at the contents of a communication to situations where the court has found probable cause to believe that information about a foreign threat will be revealed			1
although one could ask for more oversight , this is n't a bad set of legal safeguards			0
if they were followed , the @entity58 naysayers about the @entity6 's exploits would not be so hot under the collar			1
many countries besides the @entity28 collect and analyze electronic communications for national security purposes			0
the @entity64 reported wednesday that @entity65 and @entity66 helped our surveillance efforts by handing over phone records they collected on their citizens			2
illustrated by the ease with which this spying took place , these countries impose fewer limitations on their surveillance activities than we do			0
the real question is whether we follow those limitations			0
although the @entity6 may not conduct queries or examine content unless it or a court determines that " national security " is at stake , national security is apparently at stake quite often , if the recent reports about monitoring hundreds of thousands of foreigners ' calls as well as the calls of foreign leaders are true			1
@entity28 journalist @entity90 , the principal conduit for @entity5 's revelations , even claims that the @entity6 is as interested in economic intelligence as it is in exposing terrorist plots			2
he offers as evidence documents showing that the @entity28 has spied on conferences about negotiating economic agreements and on oil companies and ministries that oversee mines and energy resources			0
this may be the real reason @entity58 leaders are so incensed			0
surveillance of terrorists is fine and probably can help them quite a bit			0
but surveillance of politicians and capitalists crosses boundaries that they might think should not be crossed , at least unless and until their intelligence agencies can do it as well as and as often as the @entity28 can			0
in the meantime , @entity113 should get serious about making sure the @entity6 abides by the laws it has enacted			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity118 .			2

evidence indicates that the @entity6 stores contents of phone conversations and e-mails
@entity6 can investigate only when it can show reason it might be linked to foreign threat
@entity118 : if it is monitoring many thousands of calls , are all those *justified* ?
@entity131 : @entity113 must make sure the @entity6 abides by the laws it has enacted
