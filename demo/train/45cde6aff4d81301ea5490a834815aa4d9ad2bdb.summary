-- @entity1 decided to trust its 16 - year - olds to vote in the biggest question in its history when the country headed to the polls this week for a referendum on independence			1
@entity10 , in contrast , do n't even trust theirs to help pick the county sheriff			1
who 's right ? many here might be skeptical about the idea of the @entity10 following @entity1 's lead in lowering the voting age			1
the trouble is that the main reason most people cite for barring 16 - and 17 - year - olds from voting looks like an equally good reason to stop most @entity10 adults from voting , too			1
the key argument against letting high school juniors vote is simple : their choice would affect all of us			2
after all , a voter chooses for everyone , not just him or herself			0
many worry that most 16 - year - olds lack the wisdom or knowledge to cast smart votes , so we do n't let them vote because we want to protect ourselves from their decisions			1
and this concern is often grounded in reality -- young adults are indeed in many cases profoundly ignorant about politics			2
but if that is a reason for excluding them from voting , it is surely a reason to exclude almost everyone else			0
every two years , for 60 years , the @entity52 has surveyed what prospective voters know and do n't know			2
and the results are always depressing -- the top quartile of voters are like b students , tending to get about 85 % of questions right			0
the next two quartiles do little better or worse than chance			0
but the lowest quartile are systematically misinformed			0
indeed , if you ask them which party , @entity67 or @entity68 , is more conservative , most of them even get that answer wrong			0
as political scientists @entity72 and @entity73 noted in their 1996 book , " @entity75 , " political knowledge is not evenly spread among all groups			0
membership in some demographic groups correlates with high levels of political knowledge , depending on region , income and education , while other groups tend to correlate with political ignorance			0
so , this is the catch : if you wanted to exclude 16 - and 17 - year - olds on the grounds that they are more likely to be ignorant or misinformed , you would also in effect be arguing against other demographics having a say			1
of course , you could object that the issue here is not so much about knowledge , but the capacity for political judgment			0
yet nothing special happens at age 18 -- there is no sudden increase in cognitive ability , political wisdom or political knowledge at that age			1
in fact , in the 1970s , psychologists discovered that the biggest increases in the capacity to reason about politics occur around age 12 when puberty hits			2
by 16 , most people have about as stable an ideology and capacity to reason about politics as they are going to get			1
any improvements after that come slowly , if at all			0
it 's true that voter turnout among young adults is low -- middle - aged and elderly citizens are far more likely to vote than young adults			1
and that is not necessarily a problem			0
political scientists who study voting behavior consistently find that citizens vote for what they perceive to be the common good rather than their narrow self - interest			1
( if that seems surprising , consider : your individual vote counts for so little that if you were just acting selfishly , you probably would n't bother to vote all			2
) but it 's arguable that the needs of the young are overlooked , and that the young have valuable perspectives that are missing from the national conversation , and so perhaps expanding the voting pool would help fix that			0
and what should we do if we still ca n't get over our fear that 16 - year - olds are too dumb to vote ? well , we need n't exclude all of them			1
instead , we could allow any child who can pass the @entity10 citizenship exam to acquire the right to vote			2
of course , if you think that 's a reasonable standard for a 16 - year - old to have to meet , it 's worth remembering that most voting - age adults can not meet it either			1
so why should we demand more from our teenagers than we expect from ourselves ?			0

@entity1 allowed 16 - year - olds to vote in its referendum on independence
@entity10 worry that young people do n't know enough about politics , @entity161 says
but surveys *suggest* many other demographics have a poor grasp of politics as well , he says
there is no sudden increase in cognitive ability or political wisdom by age 18 , he says
