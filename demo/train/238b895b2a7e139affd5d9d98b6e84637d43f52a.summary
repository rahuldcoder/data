-- @entity1 reclaimed the lead in the @entity3 as @entity4 continued his hot scoring run against title hopefuls @entity6 with both goals in a 2 - 0 victory on sunday			1
@entity9 striker @entity4 has now netted 12 times in 12 encounters with @entity1 's @entity13 rivals , and could have had a hat - trick as his second - half free - kick thumped against the bar			1
@entity1 moved two points clear of @entity18 , who thrashed bottom club @entity20 on saturday , with @entity6 nine points off the leaders in third place			2
@entity6 's title challenge has disintegrated in the past two weeks , with a goalless draw against @entity27 hopefuls @entity26 followed by a 3 - 1 home defeat by @entity18 , and @entity30 's team must now face fourth - placed @entity31 on wednesday			1
" it is difficult to swallow a defeat like that when we felt we were the better team , " @entity30 told reporters			0
" @entity1 defended well until the last minute , so you have got to give them credit			0
we are outsiders but we will fight until the last day of the season			0
" @entity1 successfully bounced back from the shock draw with lowly @entity41 in midweek , which came as speculation about the future of @entity45 captain @entity44 reached fever pitch			1
the defender was subsequently stripped of the national armband by @entity45 boss @entity49 due to tabloid revelations about the player 's private life , particularly his alleged marital infidelity with the former partner of his one - time @entity1 teammate @entity55			1
but @entity44 , publicly backed by his club coach @entity56 , showed on sunday that his performances on the field have not been affected by the controversy as @entity1 's solid back four rendered @entity6 's silky passing game near impotent in the last third of the pitch			1
and it was @entity44 who helped @entity4 score the eighth - minute opening goal , heading a corner to the far post where his unmarked teammate coolly slotted the ball into the net past exposed goalkeeper @entity71			1
@entity6 dominated possession in the first half , but the closest they came to scoring was when @entity76 forward @entity75 's volley was well blocked by the legs of keeper @entity78			2
@entity4 's second goal 15 minutes later knocked the stuffing out of the visitors as he cut in from the right and lashed in a fierce left - foot shot after being fed by @entity83 on the counter-attack , with @entity6 guilty of schoolboy defending			2
@entity6 poured forward in the second half but were unable to penetrate as @entity1 could afford to sit back and absorb the pressure			2
@entity30 brought on @entity90 winger @entity89 and defender @entity91 for @entity92 and @entity93 with 15 minutes left , but it was @entity1 who almost scored again			0
@entity4 curled a powerful free - kick against the crossbar , with @entity71 left helplessly unable to even try to save it			0
in sunday 's other match , @entity99 moved up to eighth place as veteran striker @entity102 came off the bench to score both goals in the 2 - 1 win at home to @entity108 rivals @entity107			1
the visitors took the lead on manager @entity112 's 51st birthday when striker @entity113 reacted fastest to score after @entity99 defender @entity114 diverted a low cross onto his own post three minutes before halftime			0
but the 36 - year - old @entity118 scored twice in the last 10 minutes in a rare first - team outing this season to leave promoted @entity107 in the bottom three			0
the former @entity45 international leveled after @entity123 headed the ball back across goal , and then volleyed the winner five minutes from time after chesting down a chip from fullback @entity128 , who was allowed to run into the penalty area .			0

@entity1 reclaim lead in @entity3 with 2 - 0 win over title hopefuls @entity6
@entity4 nets both goals to take his tally against @entity13 rivals to 12 from 12 games
captain @entity44 , stripped of @entity45 armband , sets up first for @entity9 forward
@entity99 move up to eighth place with 2 - 1 derby victory at home to @entity146
