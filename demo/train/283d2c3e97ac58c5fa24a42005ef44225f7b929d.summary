-- the images of @entity3 's death on the streets of @entity5 transformed her into an icon for @entity9 's opposition movement			1
but very few know of @entity11 , who was killed five days before @entity3 during last year 's post-election demonstrations in the @entity9 capital			1
" i always say @entity3 is the miracle of the century , " @entity11 's mother @entity14 told @entity0 by phone			2

" @entity9 president @entity21 's landslide re-election on june 12 , 2009 , had sparked the biggest protests in @entity9 since the 1979 revolution			1
the following monday , hundreds of thousands marched to @entity5 's @entity25 , calling the vote a sham			0
@entity11 was among the crowd			0
watch @entity30 video of the chaos that day @entity11 was on leave from military duty , back in @entity5 to celebrate his 22nd birthday , just six days away			0
his parents told @entity0 that he had voted for @entity37 , the opposition candidate who had energized young @entity9 with promises of a freer society , more rights for women , and better relations with the @entity43			1
around 6 p.m. that day , @entity11 called his parents and told them not to worry , they said			1
he said he 'd be home later that evening			0
an hour later , just blocks away from @entity25 , violence erupted at a base for the @entity47 , @entity9 's pro-government militia			1

amateur video from the scene showed several armed members of the @entity47 on the rooftop apparently firing shots			0

a single bullet entered the right side of his chest , tore through both his lungs and killed him within minutes , his parents said			1
there was no way to know who fired the shot			0

@entity14 said she called @entity11 's cell phone every hour but no one answered			0

finally , at a prison morgue , a prison official showed @entity11 's father the picture of his son 's remains on a computer screen			2
" for about one hour i lost myself , " @entity108 said			0
" i was hitting myself in the face and the head , asking , ' why is my son 's naked remains on this monitor ? ' " @entity108 said an official at the prison morgue warned him to keep quiet about his son 's death			2

" they said it would n't be good for your future and the future of your children			0
" calls to @entity9 's judiciary and security officials seeking comment were not returned			1
until now , @entity14 and @entity108 have never spoken to the international media			1

" they still have n't told us anything , " @entity14 said			0
" they said , ' we did n't shoot him			0
' then who shot him ? " human rights groups say around 80 people were killed during @entity9 's 2009 post-election protests , while @entity9 's government puts the number at about half of that			1
while @entity9 has charged prison officials with torturing to death some of those detained after the demonstrations , no one has been charged in any of the deaths during the protests			1
authorities in @entity9 have told @entity0 they are investigating the deaths , but the @entity76 say they are losing hope			1
every friday morning the @entity76 visit @entity5 's main cemetery where their son 's gravesite sits just steps away from @entity3 's			2
@entity11 's parents say they do n't want the attention @entity3 is getting			2
all they want is someone to tell them who killed these two young @entity9 and why			1
" a good and ideal government is for everyone , even those who oppose it , " said @entity14			0
" if they consider themselves servants of @entity9 , then they owe us something			1
