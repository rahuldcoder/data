-- even if @entity2 dressed up as @entity3 this @entity4 , he would still have one of the most recognizable faces in @entity7			1
he may not rival @entity8 when it comes to fame on the international stage but , just like the singing icon , he is a big name in @entity7 's popular culture			1
@entity2 is a handball hero -- and handball is the second-most popular sport in @entity7 after soccer			1
when the @entity7 men 's team matches are televised , a whopping 80 % of the @entity22 island 's population of 322,000 tunes in			1
with that kind of coverage alone , it 's no wonder @entity2 is a household name , but that 's not all			1
an @entity31 silver medalist and four times voted @entity7 's sports personality of the year , at his peak he was rated as one of the best players in the global game			1
after more than 20 years at the top , @entity2 retired in 2013 and is now handing down his knowledge to the next generation of @entity7 handball hopefuls			1
the 40 - year - old has come home to the capital city of @entity45 to coach a group of young athletes at the @entity49 club , where his own career began			1
" it 's full circle , " ponders @entity2 , who now distinguishes himself from the players buzzing around him by donning a fluorescent coaching bib and yellow whistle			1
" it 's one thing being a player and another being a coach			1
" as a player , if i was not in the mood i could just do my thing 100 % , did n't have to relate to the guys or anything			2
" as a coach you do n't have that option			0
you have to vibrate , you have to be happier than those guys , you have to show passion , show urgency , show that you believe in what you 're doing			0
" it 's a great thing -- it takes you further as a person			2
" @entity2 , who represented @entity7 in 330 matches , wants to ingrain a similar understanding of going beyond the boundaries to his @entity49 charges			1
the wooden floors of the handball court spring with a squeak as the players move through the technical drills and handball skills that @entity2 describes as a player 's arsenal , but he is trying to teach them something more esoteric			1
" what i 'm focusing on -- and what is usually the most neglected factor in all team sports -- is the sense of the game , " he told @entity0 's @entity90 series			2
" you have to decide in split seconds between maybe five possibilities , and so you have to choose the best one			0
" if you have this skill , then you have everything			0
" this sixth sense on the court only comes through learned experience			2
like most children in @entity7 , @entity2 started playing handball at school , but even then he had his own spin on the game			1
" me and my best friend , we just put our socks together and made a ball out of it , " he explained			0
" one of us stood in the doorway -- and that was the goal -- while the other one tried to score			0
" @entity2 squeezed in as much practice as he could , counting down his remaining time to play with the chimes of the bells from the church next door to his school			1
but it was while at university that he made the switch from a vocational career in medicine to becoming a full - time student of the game			2
" the national team was really strong in @entity7 and they needed a left - handed player , " @entity2 explained			1
" so , i took it on			0
" the best thing that happened to me was that i did n't get through medicine the first time , so i had all spring to train like a professional			0
that happened twice -- those were the best springs of my life ! " then i studied philosophy , just went on some courses and trained for handball like never before			2
" after that , i got offers to play abroad			0
@entity145 some good characters , met some bad , but from everybody i learned something			2
" @entity2 's international career took him to @entity151 and world championships as well as three @entity31			1
he also spent 17 years on the road as a peripatetic player for leading clubs in @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and , most recently , @entity158			2
along the way , he amassed a series of domestic and five @entity151 club titles but each destination also provided new opportunities to learn			0
he described his six months living in @entity158 , as the first international player to stay in the @entity167 state on a long - term deal , as " a great time			2
" " there were some restrictions			0
great extremes between rich and poor , but they are great people , " he said			0
" i also picked up the language			0
i had to drive an hour every day to training so i had ( a cd ) of @entity177 in my ears			0
" there was also an enduring lesson to be learned at his debut @entity31 in @entity182 , where the @entity7 men 's team failed to get out of the initial group stages			1
" we did n't have much chance , " @entity2 recalled			2
" but i took it all the way , i dreamed about the medal , i wrote down before and after games things that i should have done better			0
" we finished ninth but in having done that , i had all those sketches in diaries			0
when i came back four years later i knew what i had done wrong and what not			0
" in 2008 , @entity2 was captain of @entity7 for the @entity197 and he led the team to a brilliant silver medal			1
@entity200 snatched gold by six points in the final			0
" we won the silver so that was great , " he said			2
" then in @entity205 i wanted to take it even further , so probably a month after winning the silver i started thinking about gold			0
" @entity7 arguably had a stronger team at the @entity211 but , after tuning up with bronze at the @entity213 in 2010 , @entity2 's men lost to @entity214 by an agonizing single point in the quarterfinals			1
the man they nickname " @entity218 " retired from the international game in june 2013 , but in looking back at his career it was those lessons learned in @entity222 that he draws on the most			1
" the silver medal was good , " @entity2 reflected			1
" but the classic saying is that it 's a road not a destination			0
" what i enjoy about handball is this forgetfulness that you get in the game ; you just forget yourself , your worries			0
" now i 'm just trying to wake up happy every day , do some good stuff , be joyful , and affect others in a good way			0
" when i achieve those states -- that would be my greatest achievement			0
" for now , the next part of that journey begins where it all began , with the hopeful handball players at @entity49			1
" it 's my second home , " smiles @entity2 , surveying the scene			1
" a place full of lights , you know , and full of warmth			0

@entity2 is regarded as @entity7 's most famous handball player
the 40 - year - old has played for @entity7 in 330 matches and won an @entity31 silver medal
after retiring in 2013 , he is now coaching the next generation at @entity45 club @entity49
the lessons he learned along the way *inform* his hopes of " affecting others in a good way "
