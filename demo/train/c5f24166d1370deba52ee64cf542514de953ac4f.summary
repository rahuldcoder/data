-- @entity2 sgt. @entity1 -- a former captive , a survivor and a hometown hero to many in @entity5 , @entity6 -- is being accused by some of his fellow soldiers of deserting his post			1
this charge of treason will be proven or dismissed in the coming weeks and months			2
but whether it is true or not , and whether he faces official military charges , he has already been sentenced to life to be haunted by his captivity -- and if the allegations are true , his choices			0
survivors of the @entity24 , pows during @entity19 such as sen. @entity20 and @entity22 winner adm. @entity21 , endured the rigors of long days , months and years of surviving captivity			0
but @entity1 's experiences were starkly different from those of his military predecessors			1
he was not held by a nation - state recognized by the @entity31 , nor did he have fellow prisoners to commiserate with or rely upon for comfort , aid and solace			2
the " hostage " experience when you are kidnapped by @entity39 extremists is like no other imaginable			2
every day , you wake believing you might die from a bullet from an @entity43 or a dull knife blade sawing across your throat			2
@entity1 did not have someone to share in his day - to - day misery			1
his constant fear upon waking up every morning probably was : " is this my last day on @entity49 ? " most @entity2 soldiers captured in the wars in @entity52 and @entity53 were executed within days or weeks of captivity			1
how did @entity1 survive five years with one of the most extreme and militant wings of the @entity57 ? the @entity2 @entity58 instructs all students at @entity61 schools that building rapport with your captors is critical to your survival as a hostage			1
this is urged to make your kidnappers see you as a human and not an " object " that should be exploited or executed			0
this can be as simple as learning phrases in your captor 's language to @entity1 's extreme case , where he learned @entity77 and possibly even converting to @entity39			1
every pow from @entity24 has spoken of the importance and power of communications between fellow captives as critical to their survival and sanity			1
as well as the overwhelming trauma of being held hostage , @entity1 will have to deal with the accusations of desertion by some of his fellow soldiers			1
did he indeed walk off his combat outpost in @entity53 on june 30 , 2009 , as many soldiers say he did ? in his e-mails home before his capture , @entity1 told his parents he was " ashamed to be an @entity2 , " and wrote that the @entity97 is ... " the army of liars , backstabbers , fools , and bullies			1
... i am sorry for everything here			0
the horror of the self - righteous arrogance that they thrive in			0
" yet within days of his capture , the first video proving him alive aired on july 18 , 2009			0
in it , @entity1 , choking back tears , adopted a different tone			1
" well , i 'm scared , " he said			0
" it 's very unnerving to be a prisoner			0
" we have a moral and ethical obligation to bring all @entity2 , including all members of the military , home from a hostage or prisoner of war situation			2
it 's a relief that @entity1 's long ordeal is over and he will finally be reunited with his family			1
he was the longest - held @entity2 military prisoner since @entity19 , and the only @entity2 soldier who survived any significant length of time in the capture of @entity39 militants since the post 9/11 wars in @entity52 and @entity53 began			0
" leave no man behind " is the mantra of the @entity131 to bring all pows and @entity133 home from war			0
the mission says that : " preserving the life and well - being of @entity2 military personnel placed in danger of isolation , beleaguerment , detention , or capture while participating in a @entity2 - sponsored activity or mission is one of the highest priorities of the @entity2 government and the @entity58			0
" @entity131 's other ethos is " @entity151			0
" the " freedom bird " planes that brought home @entity21 and @entity20 included pows who many believed did not live up to the same standard of resistance demonstrated by their peers			0
now five years later , sgt. @entity1 will be coming home to his family and a very mixed reception by his countrymen			1
@entity1 will have many questions to answer as he continues through the repatriation process of medical exams , physiological screenings and debriefs on what his actions were before , during and after his capture and subsequent detainment by the @entity57			2
one can only speculate about his original intent , but i expect his opinion of the @entity2 that sacrificed so much to bring him home is not what it was five years ago			0
like all soldiers , @entity1 made a solemn vow to defend his country and fellow soldiers -- to serve with honor			1
that he lived up to that oath is very much up for debate			0
some members from his former unit , " his tribe , " believe that @entity1 broke that vow			1
to be unfaithful to your fellow soldiers in a time of war is the ultimate betrayal			1
to put your brothers - in - arms at risk , some of whom might have died because of your actions , is an unforgivable sin for members of the military			0
if the accusations are true , even if he is not tried under the @entity204 , @entity1 will live with that shame the rest of his life			2
@entity1 still has a long and difficult journey home .			2

@entity1 a " hometown hero " in @entity5 , @entity6 , and a " deserter " to some soldiers
@entity214 : he learned @entity77 ; building rapport with captors is critical to survival as a hostage
he says @entity1 probably wondered each day if this would be his last
to break vow to fellow soldiers is *terrible* : if he indeed deserted , that will haunt him , too
