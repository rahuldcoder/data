-- former secretary of state @entity1 said wednesday that @entity3 intelligence officials should be questioned over their handling of " @entity5 , " an @entity7 defector whose now discredited claims on weapons of mass destruction helped fuel the @entity13 administration 's drive to war in 2003			1
it has become clear over the years that " the source called @entity5 was totally unreliable , " @entity1 said in a statement to @entity0			1
" the question should be put to the @entity19 and the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) as to why this was n't known before the false information was put into ( a key intelligence estimate ) sent to @entity24 , the president 's @entity27 address and my february 5 presentation to the @entity30 " @entity1 , in an address to members of the @entity30 @entity33 in february 2003 , said the @entity3 government had " first - hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels			1
" " the source was an eyewitness , an @entity7 chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities , " @entity1 said at the time			1
" he actually was present during biological agent production runs			0
he was also at the site when an accident occurred in 1998			0
" two months later , the invasion of @entity7 began			2
no biological weapons , no germ labs , and no weapons of mass destruction were found			1
the defector , @entity5 , has admitted in an interview with @entity55 's @entity54 newspaper that he lied to help bring down @entity57 's regime			1
" i had the chance to fabricate something , to topple the regime , " he said			0
" i did this , and i am satisfied , because there is no dictator in @entity7 anymore			2
" when @entity67 spoke to @entity0 in 2008 , he said , " i never told anyone @entity57 was producing weapons of mass destruction			1
" at the time , intelligence sources told @entity0 that @entity67 had claimed that @entity7 had a secret bioweapons program			1
but now , @entity67 admits that after he was granted asylum in @entity71 in 2000 , he used his training as a chemical engineer to concoct for his debriefers a story of @entity7 wmd production			1
although the @entity19 was not given a chance to interview @entity67 directly , and @entity71 officials had questioned some aspects of @entity67 's story , his assertions were included in the material provided to @entity1 for his @entity30 presentation			1
@entity84 , who was the @entity19 's chief of @entity86 operations at the time , agrees that the " @entity5 " information was not well - enough vetted			1
he says he had reservations at the time about relying on it , but that when he asked for direct @entity19 access to @entity67 through the @entity71 intelligence service , he was rebuffed			0
a representative of @entity71 's intelligence service declined to comment			2
@entity84 claims top @entity13 administration officials were too willing to believe @entity67 's story " because that was the only piece of intelligence they had that really fit what the administration was looking at			1
" former president @entity13 declined through a spokesman to comment			2
representatives for former vice president @entity103 , former defense secretary @entity104 , and the @entity20 did not reply to @entity0 's inquiries			0
former @entity19 director @entity106 , who was @entity84 's boss , wrote in his memoirs that " perhaps some people 's recollections of ' if only someone had listened to me ' have become sharper than reality			0
" without naming names , @entity106 said that " concerns about @entity5 did not get disseminated far and wide through the agency as they should have been			0
" former homeland security adviser @entity116 says that the @entity3 government should seek @entity67 's extradition and prosecution , for " intentionally lying and deceiving the @entity3 government			2
" " it absolutely makes my blood boil , " she told @entity0			0
not all observers are accepting @entity67 's claim that his goal in spinning his @entity126 tale was to free the people of @entity7 from @entity57			2
" he told the story because he wanted to get out of a refugee camp in @entity71 , " said @entity128 , author of a book about the episode			0
" he wanted to get his wife out and bring her to @entity71 , he wanted to get citizenship , and he wanted a @entity135			0
and he got all of those things			0
" but in his interview with the @entity54 , @entity67 said he had already won asylum before he spoke to @entity71 intelligence about weapons programs in @entity7 , and that telling them his story did not win him a life of ease			1
@entity67 insisted he is proud of the role he played in the toppling of @entity57			0
in the video of the interview posted online , he said that if he had it all to do over again , he would say the same thing " because i would n't want that regime to continue in our country			0
" @entity0 's @entity156 and @entity157 contributed to this report			0

@entity1 says @entity3 intelligence officials should be questioned over their handling of " @entity5 "
@entity5 was an @entity7 defector whose claims of @entity7 weapons of mass destruction have been discredited
@entity5 's claims helped *bolster* the @entity13 administration 's case for going to war in @entity7
@entity5 now admits he lied , but says he does n't regret his actions
