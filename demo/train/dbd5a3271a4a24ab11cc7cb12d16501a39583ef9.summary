-- he used to be found slugging it out for major tennis titles on the @entity5 turf at @entity6 -- now @entity7 spends his time lapping up the surf in @entity10			1
after more than a decade in the pressure - cooker atmosphere of top - level tennis , and a stint as an eligible bachelor in a television dating show , the man who was known as " @entity7 " because of his fearsome serve and aggressive approach now prefers a slower pace of life			1
the 35 - year - old enjoyed a 14 - year career in the game , his pair of @entity25 titles with @entity26 tempering the bitter sting of his two grand slam final defeats			1
but @entity7 has swapped his racket for a board , and insists he is as dedicated to surfing as he was professional tennis			1
" the first wave i stood up on and rode to the beach , i thought , ' this is what i am going to do for the rest of my life			0
' i knew right then and there i was just hooked , " he told @entity0 's @entity38			0
" it 's so hard to explain until you go out there and you surf -- you ca n't really explain what surfing does to you			2
for me it 's my meditation			0
people do yoga , they go on their runs and they see it as their way to release and for me it is getting in the ocean			0
" some of the things i have seen in the ocean -- whales and dolphins on a wave i 'm on , a dolphin underneath you -- it makes you feel so small but also at the same time that you are part of something so special			0
it 's an incredible thing , it 's amazing surf			0
" " it 's completely in the now , my mind 's not wondering what i 'm going to do later , what i did yesterday , it 's only about being out there , being in the moment and surfing that wave , nothing else			2
" if life is a beach for @entity7 now , it was n't towards the end of his career when injury blighted his final attempts to snare the one thing his resume lacked -- a major title			1
he lost twice in grand slam finals -- to compatriot @entity87 at the @entity88 in 1998 , before running into a young pretender called @entity90 at @entity6 in 2003			1
the " @entity90 " would go on to win the next five titles at the prestigious grass - court major			1
but though disappointment will forever linger in those twin failures , @entity93 regards his two @entity25 triumphs as his finest achievement			1
in both the successful 1999 and 2003 campaigns , @entity93 won the decisive rubber that handed his team , and his country , victory			2
the first came against @entity103 in front of a hostile crowd in @entity106 , while the second installment saw him beat @entity108 of @entity109 in front of a partisan crowd in his home town of @entity113			0
that commitment to the team , rather than the individual , is a typically @entity26 trait , where representing your country inspires pride and every last ounce of effort			1
" it 's the pinnacle of what you want to do as an athlete , " he said , " especially in @entity26 where we are so sports driven			2
with the @entity131 , with swimming , with everything we want to do , with the history			0
" @entity25 has huge history with @entity26 , with the names and how many times we have won the cup so you grew up watching a lot of those matches			1
" there 's a tournament every week on the @entity143 so obviously we want to do as well as we can , but if we do n't the mentality can be easily , " ok next week			0
" with @entity25 , well , it is every year , but it 's every few months that you play that tie , and it 's not just you , you are playing for your teammates , your coach , your captain , your country			1
" there 's a lot of pressure there , the atmosphere at @entity25 is like no other event and it 's an incredible experience			2
" his efforts in 2003 proved to be the final year @entity7 threatened tennis ' top table , as persistent injuries and erratic form saw him slide out of the top 100 and turn his thoughts to life off court			1
as such @entity7 , who completed various stints of modeling throughout his playing career , played the role of eligible bachelor for the 2007 television show " @entity174 " in which he had to choose one lady to date from a group of younger " kittens " or older " cougars			1
" " if i could sum it up in one sentence i would say it was quite an experience , " he explained			0
" it was fun , then extremely frustrating , then i kind of wanted to get off the show and it was one of those things that i look back on and i do n't regret at all			2
" i did it , it was another experience in my life and it was fun			0
would i want to do anything like that again ? no. absolutely not , but it was fun			0
" his last competitive tennis match came in @entity195 in 2010 but now his main focus in life is to plan board meeting after board meeting , in the @entity200			1
" one of the amazing things about surfing is that every wave is different , every condition is different , every time i get up on the board is different			2
but the most important thing for me is it 's my passion , i want to try to get as good as i can			0
" i 'm improving ; i 'm out there every day			0
just like tennis , if you want to get better , you 've got to get out there , so i am			0
