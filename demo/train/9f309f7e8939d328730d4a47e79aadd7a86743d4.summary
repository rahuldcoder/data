-- @entity2 @entity1 and her @entity4 former boyfriend , @entity3 , won their appeals of their convictions in the killing of @entity11 exchange student @entity9			1
here is a guide to the @entity4 appeal process			1
on what grounds did @entity15 and @entity3 appeal their convictions for murder , sexual assault , possession of a weapon , interfering with a crime and theft ? the defense sought to discredit dna evidence linking the two of them to the killing , in which @entity11 exchange student @entity9 's throat was slashed			1
her partially clothed body was found in the house she shared with @entity15 in @entity34 , a central @entity4 university town			1
two experts argued that dna evidence found on the knife used to kill @entity37 and on her bra clasp was unreliable and contaminated by poor handling			1
prosecutors in 2009 had said there were traces of @entity15 's genetic material on the handle and @entity37 's in a tiny groove on the blade			1
@entity15 and @entity3 's defense teams have suggested @entity9 , who is already serving a 16 - year sentence for the murder , could have been the sole killer			1
the case against @entity15 and @entity3 who made the decision ? eight jurors -- six members of the public and two judges -- decided the case			1
the judges take part and vote as part of the jury : their role is to guide but not to instruct the other jurors how to vote			1
the presiding judge , @entity66 , who was also one of the jurors , read out the verdict			0
what were the possible rulings in the appeal ? there were three possible outcomes for the defendants : 1			2
verdict is upheld : in this case , @entity15 and @entity3 would have continued serving their respective 26 - and 25 - year jail sentences			2
however , prosecutor @entity79 had called for their sentences to be increased to life			0
verdict is partially overturned , with a decrease in sentence ( verdicts can be upheld on some counts but not others ; this would result in a decrease in their sentences , which is what happened )			0
does monday 's ruling mean the case is closed for good or could there be further appeals ? there will most likely be appeals by the prosecution			0
both the defense and prosecution can take their case to @entity4 's highest court			1
both @entity15 and @entity3 returned to prison to complete paperwork and collect their belongings			2
but @entity15 was freed within an hour ; @entity0 understands @entity15 will leave the country tuesday morning			2
@entity15 , 24 , need not remain in @entity4 pending a possible appeal by the prosecution			1
after the ruling , the judge has 90 days to write a report on why the court reached its conclusions			0
the parties then have 45 days to file an appeal to the @entity118 , which then must schedule it , according to @entity121 law professor @entity120			0
so there 'll be at least four months between the verdict and any possible @entity118 appeal			0
a @entity118 hearing would be very short and dependent on key technical issues and arguments , not a review of the actual trial itself , according to @entity131			0
where would an acquittal of just @entity15 and / or @entity3 have left the case of the other ? that was the big question			2
the co-defendants appealed together , and while different verdicts could theoretically have been delivered for each of them , this was highly unlikely			0
a third person convicted of the murder , @entity9 , has already appealed to the @entity118 and had his sentence reduced to 16 years			2
can the defendants ever be tried again for the same crime ? after the case goes to @entity4 's highest court and assuming it does not overturn the appeals ruling , @entity15 can not be tried again for the same crime under the " double jeopardy " rule			1
what will happen if a possible appeal by the prosecution to @entity4 's highest court is successful after @entity15 has returned to the @entity2 ? if @entity4 's highest court overturns the lower court 's decision , it effectively revalidates the trial court 's sentence , which means 26 years in prison for @entity15			1
@entity4 would then have to put in a request to @entity2 authorities for extradition , and it would remain to be seen if that would granted or not			1
deputy @entity166 spokesman @entity165 told @entity0 : " questions regarding @entity4 law and process are not ones we can answer			2
they need to be addressed to @entity4 authorities			2
" the @entity2 and @entity4 do have a bilateral extradition treaty , which has been in force since 1984			2
questions about possible return to the @entity2 , extradition request , etc. are too speculative for us to be able to comment			0
" does @entity4 law allow for any civil action by the defendants or by @entity9 's family following a criminal case ? yes , a civil action for damages took place alongside the original criminal trial			1
the family of @entity37 sought $ 36 million in damages from the three co-defendants if they were convicted on the criminal charges			0
their acquittal on the criminal charges frees them of civil liability as well			0
did the defendants face any other charges ? @entity15 also appealed an additional charge for which she was convicted : defamation of @entity9 , the club owner whom @entity15 accused of killing @entity37			1
he was arrested but released after his alibi checked out			0
he later sued @entity15 for libel , winning 40,000 euros ( $ 54,000 ) in damages			0
the appeals jury upheld that conviction and ordered @entity15 to pay @entity208			0
it also sentenced her to three years in prison , but because she has already been held for four years , she was freed immediately			0
@entity212 contributed to this report .			0
