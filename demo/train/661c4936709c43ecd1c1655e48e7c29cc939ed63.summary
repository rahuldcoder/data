@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a ruling read to a tension - filled courtroom , an @entity1 jury on monday cleared @entity8 of murder and other charges , nearly four years after she was arrested on suspicion of having killed her roommate in this picturesque @entity1 university town			1
there was an audible gasp in the courtroom as the verdict was read , then an eruption of emotion , prompting the judge to call for silence			2
@entity20 herself was nearly hysterical , according to @entity2 's @entity22 , and had to be assisted out of the courtroom by two people			1
the jury evidently believed @entity20 's impassioned final statement to the court , delivered in a voice trembling with emotion			1
" i am not what they say i am -- perverse , violent			2
... i have n't murdered			0
i have n't stolen , " @entity20 said in the most important speech of her life			1
her co-defendant , @entity34 , was also cleared of involvement in the 2007 death of @entity38 , a @entity40 exchange student and @entity20 's roommate in @entity0			1
" we 're thankful that @entity8 's nightmare is over , " @entity20 's sister , @entity42 , said on the courthouse steps , getting a roar of approval from the crowd			1
" she suffered for four years for a crime she did not commit			0
" @entity50 thanked her sister 's attorneys and " people who took the time to research the case and could see that @entity8 and @entity34 were innocent , " for supporting the @entity20 family			1
the same jury , however , upheld @entity20 's conviction on the charge of defamation against @entity38 , an early suspect in the case			1
she had accused club owner @entity64 of killing @entity65			0
@entity64 was arrested , but released after his alibi checked out			0
he later sued @entity20 , winning 40,000 euros ( $ 54,000 ) in damages			1
@entity20 was sentenced monday to three years on the defamation charge , but received credit for the years she has already spent behind bars , said her attorney , @entity72			1
" we 're satisfied with the decision of the court , " @entity72 told @entity2			0
" we were expecting the rectification of this mistake			0
" he said @entity20 is ready to go home , but has said she will return to @entity1			1
" she always confirmed she was a friend of @entity38 , " he said			2
as the verdict was read in court , @entity65 's family grew emotional			2
" we respect the decision of the judges but we do not understand how the decision of the first trial could be so radically overturned , " the @entity85 said in a statement , issued through a journalist close to the family , after returning to their hotel on monday			0
" we still trust the @entity1 judicial system and hope that the truth will eventually emerge			1
" some of those gathered outside were unhappy with the ruling , shouting " @entity98 ! shame ! " among those outside the court were a handful of college - age @entity1 and @entity103 , including two young @entity1 men who told @entity2 they disagreed with the ruling and believe @entity20 and @entity34 are guilty			1
one of them , @entity107 , 18 , is a student at the same university @entity65 attended			0
@entity107 said he is studying international communications			0
" i am very upset with @entity1 justice , " said a woman who gave her name as @entity113 and said she is a fourth - year law student in @entity0			1
the legal process , she said , had gone " very , very bad			0
" " this family needs some justice , " she said of the @entity85 , " and more important , you know , the real truth of the story			0
" she said a majority of those in @entity0 " absolutely " agree with her , adding , " i 'm not satisfied			0
" @entity20 and her defense team succeeded in overturning a conviction handed down two years ago by a different jury , which found her and @entity34 guilty of killing of @entity65 , who was sexually assaulted and her throat slashed			1
" i am innocent , " @entity20 said monday			1
" @entity34 put his claim simply in his own closing statement before @entity20 spoke			1
" i have never hurt anybody , " he said			0
as he concluded , he dramatically removed his plastic " @entity133 and @entity34 " bracelet , saying : " i have never taken it off since it was given to me			0
... i think now is the moment to take it off			0
" his voice almost inaudible , he concluded , " i hope this is part of history and that @entity8 and i have a future			0
" @entity20 was expected to go back to jail to complete her release paperwork and gather her belongings before leaving for the last time			1
as one van pulled up outside the prison , the sound of cheering could be heard from inside			2
a few minutes later , a black van pulled away from the prison and was chased by photographers			2
@entity150 , a member of the @entity1 parliament who became an advocate for @entity20 , confirmed that @entity20 was inside			1
" @entity8 was incredibly happy , " @entity150 said , adding that @entity20 will leave tuesday for @entity154 , her hometown			1
she was greeted at the prison by cheers and shouts of " well done , " prompting her to jump for joy , he said			1
@entity20 was headed to meet her parents nearby after leaving the prison , he said			1
" her first desire is to lie down on a green field			1
" in @entity167 , @entity166 spokeswoman @entity165 said , " the @entity103 appreciates the careful consideration of this matter within the @entity1 judicial system			1
" the @entity103 @entity171 in @entity172 will continue to provide consular assistance to @entity20 and her family , she said			1
" i am glad that the appeals court gave @entity8 the fair hearing that she deserves , " said @entity103 sen. @entity175 , @entity176 , who had helped push for the appeal , in a statement			0
" all countries must live up to their international commitments to provide a fair trial by an impartial tribunal to those accused of crimes			0
" @entity8 's parents , family and friends have been through an incredible ordeal , " @entity175 said			2
" we are all thankful that she will be free to return to @entity154 as soon as possible			1
" @entity34 's father , @entity192 , told @entity2 in a brief conversation the family was driving towards home			2
" we are now starting to talk , " he said			0
" i ca n't say more			0
@entity34 is very spaced out			0
" @entity20 's lawyer @entity196 reminded the jury monday that they had to be convinced " beyond a reasonable doubt " that @entity20 and @entity34 were guilty if they were to uphold the conviction			1
at least four members of the jury -- composed of six members of the public and two judges -- must have concluded they did , indeed , have doubts about her conviction			2
a majority ruling was all that was needed to throw out the conviction , with a tie favoring the defense			0
the actual vote will remain secret , but the main judge , @entity214 , will file a statement explaining the jury 's reasoning within 90 days of the ruling			2
@entity20 and @entity34 were convicted of murder , sexual assault and related crimes related to @entity65 's death in december 2009			1
a third man , drifter @entity38 , was convicted separately of involvement in the killing and is serving 16 years			0
in the appeal , lawyers for @entity20 and @entity34 picked apart dna evidence that played a role in the original conviction			2
part of the original prosecution case was based on dna evidence found on a knife and on a bra clasp belonging to @entity65			0
during the appeal , experts for the two sides battled over whether the dna evidence was reliable			0
they also fought over the character of @entity20			2
the lawyer for a man falsely accused of the crime called @entity20 " @entity251 - like , demonic , @entity250 , " while @entity34 defense counsel @entity245 insisted that , like the buxom cartoon temptress @entity248 in the movie " @entity246 ? " @entity20 is not bad , just " drawn that way			2
" @entity20 herself acknowledged the debate monday in her closing statement			2
" people always ask ' who is @entity8 ? ' " she said			0
" i am the same person i was four years ago			0
... the only thing that now separates me from four years ago is my suffering			0
" in four years , i 've lost my friends in the most terrible and unexplainable way			0
my trust in the authorities and the police has been damaged			0
i had to face charges that were totally unfair , without any basis			0
and i am paying with my life for something i have n't done			0
" @entity20 was 20 and @entity65 was 21 years old , studying at @entity0 's university for foreign students , when @entity65 's semi-naked body was found in the house they shared			1
@entity34 , 23 at the time , was @entity20 's boyfriend , studying computer science at another university in @entity0			1
either side can appeal this court 's ruling to @entity1 's @entity279 , but such an appeal would be on narrow technical grounds only			1
@entity2 's @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity22 , @entity284 and @entity285 and journalist @entity286 contributed to this report .			2

@entity20 's first desire , friend says , is to " lie down on a green field "
