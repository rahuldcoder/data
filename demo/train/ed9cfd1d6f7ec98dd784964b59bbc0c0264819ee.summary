but the collapse of communism in @entity87 , which led to the collapse of the @entity92 empire itself , turned a new page in @entity6 relations with trade quickly replacing rhetoric			0

@entity4 has supported @entity6 in its sphere of influence , such as in the @entity145 crisis , expecting that @entity6 would support @entity4 's interests in @entity163 , on issues such as @entity165			1
" the blatant hypocrisies in @entity6 's policies and actions have been evident this week as @entity6 invaded @entity9 while continuing to oppose further sanctions or action in @entity145 out of respect for @entity145 's territorial integrity and sovereignty			2
" @entity4 's balancing act yet @entity4 seems likely to remain noncommittal over @entity9			1
" @entity4 may think its interests are better served by continuing to avoid taking a clear stance , hoping that it will be well positioned whatever the outcome , " said @entity138			0
" but given @entity4 's enhanced influence and power , the international community increasingly looks to @entity4 for a more principled approach and to take a leadership role to help resolve international crises , not simply position itself to be in the most advantageous situation when it is all said and done			1
" other @entity4 watchers believe @entity0 's stance may be rooted in issues closer to home , noting that the country does not want to give the appearance of backing a separatist movement , given its own problems with ethnic tensions , primarily in the western regions of @entity195 and @entity196			2
