-- i cried several times yesterday			2
this happened as i was reviewing scripts for @entity0 's upcoming coverage of the one - year anniversary of the @entity7 tragedy in @entity8 , @entity9			1
i also cried as i reviewed a script about the bravery of @entity12 who single - handedly prevented a similar tragedy from occurring in a suburban @entity16 elementary school			2
i have an almost 8 - year - old daughter and a 10 - year - old son			0
if i had lived in @entity8 , my daughter could have been in one of the first - grade classrooms that was targeted			1
it is heartbreaking to think of what could have been and whether my children would have survived			0
my heart goes out to all of those who experienced such unthinkable loss			0
@entity0 was not involved in the @entity29 ' litigation to gain release of the @entity8 911 calls , but i applaud the court 's decision in support of open government and public access to government records			1
i have read and heard some of the powerful and emotional pleas of families , attorneys and their supporters who felt the 911 calls should have been withheld			0
yet i fully believe that access to public records is crucial , even if painful			1
we can never learn the truth about our society and its ills and inspirations without full access to public documents			1
no matter how well - meaning public officials may be in withholding records , it should not be left to them to determine what our reality is			2
as a media lawyer , it is inevitable that i will be faced with advising on painful stories and the disturbing videos , images and sound that go along with them			1
we filed a lawsuit for access to the @entity69 recovery efforts , and we have recently gone to court to gain release of all records and data relating to the death of @entity75 , @entity76 , teen @entity77			1
some images i can not bear to look at -- or sounds to hear -- but i will do so because i know we are committed to shedding light on important stories and issues			0
and maybe one day those stories will make a difference and prevent future tragedies and suffering of other families			0
i realize not everybody is going to agree with how @entity0 handled the 911 calls , but one thing we can all agree on is that we need to hug our kids tighter			0
i did that as soon as i walked in the door from work yesterday evening			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are those of @entity94 .			2

@entity94 : as a mother , i understand the pain of events such as @entity8
she says that as a media lawyer , she sees the need for the release of public records
" we can never learn the truth about our society *...* without full access to public documents "
