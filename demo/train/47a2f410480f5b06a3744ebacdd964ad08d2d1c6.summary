@entity0 -- before wednesday 's @entity8 debate , the bulk of what people knew about @entity6 candidate @entity5 came from clips from a talk show from the 1990s			1
in the month since @entity5 rocked the political world with her upset win over rep. @entity14 in the @entity6 primary , she 's dominated headlines despite avoiding the national media			1
wednesday 's debate , co-moderated by @entity1 's @entity19 and longtime @entity21 news anchor @entity20 , could prove to be make or break for @entity5 's @entity8 bid			1
she and @entity25 @entity24 are vying to fill the seat held for nearly four decades by now - vice president @entity27 the debate gave @entity5 an opportunity to reintroduce herself to voters , define her views and chip away at the 19 - point deficit she must overcome to defeat @entity24			1
it also provided a chance to do the opposite			0
@entity5 and @entity24 focused largely on the economy and national issues during their 90 - minute exchange			1
updates from @entity21 @entity5 threw rocks at @entity24 throughout the debate , while he tried to paint her answers as frivolous and unintelligible			1
" @entity24 can can barely contain his disdain for his opponent , " noted @entity43 , a senior political analyst for @entity1			1
the debate produced a few humorous moments , such as when @entity24 said @entity5 's well - publicized statements that she dabbled in witchcraft and questioned evolution theory were distractions instead of a substantive campaign issue			1
" you 're just jealous that you were n't on @entity56 , " @entity5 said , referring to the comedy show 's satirical skit about her			2
" i 'm dying to see who 's going to play me , " @entity24 responded with a smile			2
the debate was tense and @entity5 was feisty -- until a flub near the end			1
@entity5 was tripped up by the same question that caused problems for then - vp candidate @entity64 in her interview with @entity66 about @entity68 decisions			1
asked if she could name a recent @entity68 case she disagreed with , @entity5 said , " can you give me a specific one ? " @entity5 was unable to provide a case , but said decisions she disagreed with would be posted on her website			1
while the forum was one of the most anticipated events of the campaign season , not everyone was as captivated			0
" even if i lived in [ @entity21 , ] i would n't watch			0
i already know about this woman to question everything she has done			0
her ethics and character leave a lot to be desired , " commented @entity1 reader @entity80			0
@entity84 planned to tune in for the entertainment			0
" anybody in their right mind will be able to tell right away if she is truly knowledgeable of the topics , " the reader said			0
@entity21 voters had varying impressions of the debate			0
@entity93 said @entity5 did a good job showing who she really is			2
" i think that @entity5 needed to show that she 's a human being , a real person and that she 's impassioned , that all this other sort of conversation that 's been going on about her is not really accurate			2
and i think that 's what she attempted to do , and i think she did very well with that , " he said			0
but voter @entity107 was hardly impressed			0
" i find it abundantly disconcerting that we have this much in common with @entity110 , " she said			0
" even if you have some concerns about @entity24 ' history or his politics or whatever , yet again , we have a polarized election where it 's a black and white thing , because she is so far off the grid			2
" another voter , identified by her first name only , said that after watching the debate , she decided she was n't voting for either candidate			0
" i just feel that @entity5 does n't really answer any questions			2
she goes very circular on things			0
and i just feel like @entity24 has been kind of condescending			2
and it 's just i do n't get a good feeling from either candidate , " @entity126 told @entity1			0
immediate reaction from the blogosphere was also mixed			1
the @entity131 said the debate " did n't have a clear cut winner as far as who answered better , " but it predicted @entity5 would benefit most			1
the blog gave credit to both candidates for substantive answers , but was turned off by @entity24 ' " snide retorts			2
" the left - leaning blog @entity141 said that while @entity5 may have mastered her talking points , she " had a tough time this evening with some basic questions about issues she 'd face if she is elected to the @entity8			1
" how do you think she did ? did @entity5 win or lose votes based on her performance ?			0
