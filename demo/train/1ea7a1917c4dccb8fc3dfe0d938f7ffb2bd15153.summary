-- the last @entity2 combat brigade has pulled out of @entity3 , but does that mean the more than 50,000 @entity2 troops who will remain there will never fire a shot or come under attack ? a total end to violence seems unlikely , retired @entity11			1
but @entity12 , a former assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs , says @entity3 's military forces are ready to handle their country 's security challenges and protect the @entity2 advisers			1
@entity12 weighed in on the situation thursday on @entity0 's " @entity18			2
" @entity0 : how vulnerable are we leaving @entity3 -- and our remaining troops -- as new spasms of violence occur ? @entity12 : the question is not whether there will be a total elimination of security incidents or not			1
the fundamental question is : can the @entity3 security forces manage the process without needing @entity2 assistance ? yes , there will be low levels of violence even with a fully competent @entity3 security force			1
but even with 170,000 @entity2 forces , there were low levels of violence there as well			0
the @entity3 are saying , " we can handle it now without @entity2 assistance , " and i believe that to be the case			2
@entity0 : are you concerned that the @entity2 troops who remain in @entity3 as trainers and adviser are at greater risk because of their smaller numbers ? @entity12 : i 'm pretty comfortable on the combat capability of the @entity3 security forces			1
they have demonstrated , over the past couple of years , increasing levels of competence			0
and i believe the military commanders on the ground judge them to be ready to take over that responsibility in its entirety			0
so our remaining troops , who are in fact combat capable but in a support role , i think they 're in pretty good shape			0
and the situation 's in pretty good shape for the moment			0
@entity0 : how much of a change in their work will the remaining @entity2 forces see ? @entity12 : well , first , many people think that the @entity2 forces have been engaged in tough combat over the last couple of years			1
in fact , the @entity3 forces have been in the lead			1
it has been a gradual process of just handing complete combat responsibility over to the @entity3			2
while that 's been going on , there has been an advisory and an assistance mission , which the 50,000 troops that are remaining will [ continue ]			0
they 'll work inside of the @entity3 units , providing assistance , military mentoring , and that will continue for another year and a half			2
@entity0 : in 7½ years of war in @entity3 , we have seen more than 4,400 troops killed and more than $ 600 billion spent			1
has it been worth it ? have we achieved our goals ? @entity12 : well , we 'll never be able to simply tell the @entity2 people that the loss of any life is worthwhile			1
but what i would say is , let 's take a look at where @entity3 is today			2
it 's a democratic state , a friend to its neighbors , no longer a threat to the @entity2			0
those soldiers who have sacrificed for the last 7½ years , some who have given their lives , i think they can look back and realize that they left @entity3 in a much better position over the last 7½ years by their presence than had they not been there			1
@entity112 : casualties in @entity3 and @entity114 @entity0 : were there missed opportunities ? were there things that could have been done differently that would have left us with the same overall impact in @entity3 but with less cost and less time ? @entity12 : look , i think as you look at any military campaign over history , looking back , yes , there are places and opportunities that were missed : @entity129 , significant intelligence miscalculations in the @entity131			1
sure , we 'd like to do it over again			0
we 'd like to do it over better			0
but i think that that 's just the nature of warfare			0
and you 're going find that in any historical example , not just @entity3			0
@entity0 : what does the change in mission in @entity3 mean for the ongoing operation in @entity114 ? @entity12 : well , that 's still going to be a tough fight			1
but what reducing the force levels in @entity3 does is , number one , it provides more dwell time for soldiers back with their families			0
we 've been looking at setting up a program where [ troops will have ] one year in combat , two years at home			0
by having less of a burden inside of @entity3 , that may be achieved			0
@entity159 : reports from the front second , it also frees up critical assets that have been used in @entity3 that now can add to those that are already in @entity114			1
so i think overall the net effect will be a positive one for @entity114 and for our mission there .			2

all fighting unlikely to stop , retired @entity11 . gen. @entity12 says
@entity3 forces have been taking the lead for two years , he says
sacrifices of blood and *resources* were worthwhile , @entity12 says
change of mission in @entity3 should improve capabilities in @entity114 , he says
