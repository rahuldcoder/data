intense street fighting raged in the @entity2 city of @entity3 monday as @entity4 came closer to capturing a key area on the border with @entity7			1
@entity4 fighters planted their flag on a hill on the eastern side of @entity3 , then punched through defenses to open up the route for more troops , one witness inside the city told @entity17			1
@entity17 crews on monday also spotted what appeared to be the black flag of @entity4 flying from a hilltop on the eastern side of the city			2
the flag was farther east into the city from one shown flying atop a building in video from @entity28 and also seen by the @entity17 crews			0
many @entity32 forces defending the city were wounded and killed , and many @entity4 fighters were also killed as clashes spread from street to street , the witness said			1
the fall of the city would carry huge symbolic and strategic weight , giving @entity4 sway over an uninterrupted swatch of land between the @entity7 border and its self - declared capital in @entity46 , @entity2 , 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) away			1
the @entity7 military , which has bulked up its defenses along the border in recent days as the fighting has flared , blocked people fleeing the embattled city from crossing the border			1
" we want to go across ! " would - be refugees chanted as they pressed against a border fence			0
one witness inside @entity3 told @entity17 he 'd been waiting to leave the city with hundreds of others since sunday night			1
" we 'll get killed if we stay , " he said			2
as @entity4 fighters attacked with tanks and heavy artillery , the city 's defenders vowed to keep fighting			1
" we are afraid of this			0
we are obliged to defend our home , our town , " @entity32 @entity3 official @entity66 said			1
" we did n't choose this war , but we are obliged to fight			1
" @entity70 and allies strike again @entity4 managed to close in on @entity3 despite airstrikes by the @entity70 and allied forces over the weekend and on monday			1
the most recent airstrikes took out two fighting positions near @entity3 and two tanks near @entity46 , as well as two small @entity4 units , two mortar positions and a building in @entity81 , the @entity70 military said monday			1
over the weekend , allied airstrikes destroyed two isis tanks , a bulldozer and another @entity4 vehicle , @entity82 said			2
two airstrikes hit a large @entity4 unit and destroyed six firing positions , the @entity70 military said			1
a senior defense official said monday to expect more airstrikes against @entity4 targets in the @entity3 area			1
but that 's easier said than done			0
another senior military official said many @entity4 targets in @entity3 are too close to the @entity7 border or @entity32 forces to strike			1
and the @entity100 , the official said , believes there 's a media outcry about the situation in @entity3 because reporters are there			2
many other towns have fallen to @entity4 without tv crews present , the official said			2
no matter what role @entity70 airstrikes play going forward , such attacks are n't enough , @entity66 said			0
" when i talk to people here in @entity3 , they thank the international community , and the @entity70 , they thank the countries who are striking the @entity4			2
but everyone believes it is not enough , " he said			0
the " international community can not defeat isis by just hitting them from the sky			0
they have to help the people who are fighting -- the ( @entity122 ) @entity123 , the ( rebel ) @entity124 who are here on the ground			0
" meanwhile , about 270 kilometers ( 168 miles ) to the east , in the northeastern @entity2 city of @entity129 , @entity4 suicide bombers drove trucks into checkpoints manned by @entity32 , exploding them almost simultaneously , according to the @entity133 , a @entity134 - based monitoring group			1
thirty @entity32 fighters died in the attack , the group said			2
helicopters used in @entity81 strikes @entity145 @entity144 gunships were used against @entity4 targets in @entity81 's @entity148 province over the weekend , the senior defense official who spoke about the plans for more @entity3 airstrikes told @entity17			1
fixed - wing aircraft also were on the mission , but because @entity81 forces were close to @entity4 forces , the @entity152 were used because they fly low and can strike with precision , the official said			2
the official described the area as " very much contested , with @entity4 continuing to make gains			2
" the low altitude used by @entity152 poses a risk , but with @entity4 forces in such a populated area , their precision was needed , the official said			0
@entity70 officials do n't see @entity4 making a direct run for @entity168 , but concerns remain that @entity4 elements are in the city and around the airport , the official said			1
in other developments : total cost of @entity70 airstrikes so far ? more than $ 62 million , @entity100 says @entity70 military airstrikes against @entity4 targets in @entity81 and @entity2 have cost more than $ 62 million so far , according to data provided by the @entity100			1
the data , apparently sent out inadvertently monday to the @entity100 's press contacts , lists the total number of airstrikes by @entity82 in @entity81 and @entity2 , details locations of targets and specifies the costs of munitions used			2
militant leader 's fate unknown the @entity70 is still unsure if an airstrike killed the leader of the @entity190			0
@entity70 officials are still assessing the strike on the first night of airstrikes in @entity2 , and whether it killed @entity194 , the senior defense official told @entity17			1
while he has not surfaced publicly or on social media , @entity70 officials still have not seen sufficient corroborating intelligence , such as evidence of a funeral or martyrdom statements , the official said			0
@entity4 gets @entity203 @entity202 encouragement @entity203 @entity202 spokesman @entity204 issued a statement expressing solidarity with isis and other fighters in @entity2			1
" in these times when the enemy is standing against you we ask that you forget internal strife and rivalries and stand up against the nonbeliever army , " @entity204 said in the statement			0
" the @entity214 of the world look to you with great expectation , and in this difficult time , we , your mujahidin brothers , are with you and will provide you with fighters and help , " the statement said			0
@entity70 vice president apologizes @entity70 vice president @entity221 apologized to @entity7 and the @entity222 for saying @entity224 allies are partly to blame for the strengthening of @entity4			0
at an appearance last week at @entity227 , he said the militant @entity229 group had been inadvertently strengthened by actions allies took to help opposition groups fighting against @entity2 president @entity233			0
" they poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against @entity233			0
except that the people who were being supplied were @entity239 and @entity240 and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world , " @entity221 said			0
on @entity7 's alleged role , he said , " president ( @entity245 ) @entity245 told me ... ' you were right			0
we let too many people ( including foreign fighters ) through			0
