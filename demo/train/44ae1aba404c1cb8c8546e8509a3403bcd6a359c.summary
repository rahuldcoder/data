-- imagine for a moment that instead of just the @entity4 @entity3 , 16 federal agencies were responsible for administering the federal food stamp program			1
also imagine that each of these agencies had unchecked taxpayer resources and no public oversight			1
neither the taxpayer nor anyone in @entity12 would stand for it			0
but that is exactly what is happening with @entity4 's intelligence programs			2
in august of last year , @entity17 leaked documents that gave taxpayers and most legislators a first - ever glimpse at the amount of money spent on intelligence activities by 16 federal agencies			1
what did the documents reveal ? among other things , we learned that , over the past 10 years , the budget for the @entity30 ballooned by 56 % and the @entity32 budget jumped by 54 %			0
and what do we know about where that taxpayer money went ? virtually nothing , because intelligence spending is considered top secret and legislative oversight is done behind closed doors			1
the reality is that most lawmakers -- and , therefore , the taxpayers we represent -- do n't gain access to intelligence spending information			1
those who do are sworn to secrecy			0
with the exception of the budget snapshot revealed by @entity17 , this top - line agency information remains buried in the so - called " black budget " that makes up the @entity51			1
and unless @entity12 acts , it will remain buried and unavailable to public scrutiny			1
the biggest threat to successfully implementing any federal program is the combination of unchecked funding and limited oversight , which is precisely the situation with @entity4 's intelligence programs			1
revelations about the @entity32 's intelligence - gathering programs have @entity4 on edge and justifiably demanding transparency and oversight			2
but this oversight is not possible without knowing how much money each of these agencies is spending			2
intelligence - gathering plays a vital role in the safety and freedom of all @entity4			0
the importance of intelligence activities should not , however , exclude them from budget accountability			0
to the contrary , the critical nature of these programs is exactly why intelligence agencies should meet basic budget accountability requirements			0
we are joined by 60 of our colleagues -- from liberal to conservative -- in sponsoring legislation that will take a simple first step toward long - overdue oversight of intelligence programs			0
our bill , the @entity90 , will require the president to disclose in his annual budget the top - line intelligence budgets of 16 intelligence agencies			1
to be clear , we do not propose exposing intelligence program details , or sources and methods			0
doing so could compromise operations and the safety of intelligence personnel			0
we are simply insisting that the total amount spent on intelligence at each agency be made public			0
the @entity105 , informally known as the @entity105 , recommended the disclosure of this basic information			0
@entity108 , the commission 's widely respected vice chairman and former chairman of the @entity111 , has endorsed our legislation			0
" @entity4 needs competent and effective intelligence - gathering agencies , " @entity108 said			2
" and @entity12 must exercise prudent and diligent oversight to assure the @entity4 taxpayer is getting what it 's paying for			1
the first step toward accountability and oversight is public disclosure of the top - line budget numbers of all our intelligence - gathering agencies			1
" simply put , the taxpayer has a right to know the price tag for intelligence spending by agency			2
disclosing this basic information will help @entity12 and the public compare spending trends over time and measure intelligence needs against other budget priorities			1
the debate over secrecy in the name of national security is more relevant now than ever before			0
shining a light on the intelligence budget is an important and practical step in ensuring an accountable and effective intelligence program and restoring the confidence of the @entity4 people in their government 's intelligence activities .			2
