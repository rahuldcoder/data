-- as mobile devices get increasingly slimmer , so too will their corresponding usb connectors			0
even better , you wo n't have to flip the cable when you try to slip it in upside down			0
development for the next - generation usb connector , called the @entity9 , is underway and will be thinner and sleeker than current @entity11 cables ( pictured above ) , according to the @entity12 , which is made up of industry heavy hitters including @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity18 to pack the powerful punch of the usb 3.1 standard , which can move data at 10 gigabits per second , into a smaller cable , it will closely resemble the usb 2.0 @entity24 but it has a few advantages over existing models : specifically , it 's reversible , meaning users no longer need to worry about plug orientation			1
the plug design is similar to @entity34 's @entity33 cables and will take away one of @entity12 's main frustrations			0
the downside is that the new cables wo n't work with existing connectors			0
the @entity40 is built on existing @entity42 and usb 2.0 technologies and will have scalable power capabilities , meaning it will be able to charge a wide range of gadgets			1
" while usb technology is well established as the favored choice for connecting and powering devices , we recognize the need to develop a new connector to meet evolving design trends in terms of size and usability , " said @entity47 , usb 3.0 promoter group chairman , in a statement			2
" the new @entity40 will fit well with the market 's direction and affords an opportunity to lay a foundation for future versions of @entity11			2
" the organization said the @entity40 will be completed by mid- 2014			1
