-- @entity2 president @entity1 said sunday the @entity3 and its allies must have patience if his country is not ready to assume control of its own security by july 2011 , when @entity3 troops would begin leaving under president @entity12 's plan			1
@entity1 spoke to @entity0 's " @entity14 " program in his first television interview since @entity12 's announcement last week that he will deploy an additional 30,000 @entity3 troops to @entity2			1
@entity12 also said the @entity3 forces would begin withdrawing from @entity2 in july 2011			1
the date was not " an exit announcement , " but instead a goal for @entity2 forces to be able to start assuming security control from @entity3 - led allied forces , @entity1 said in the interview			1
" we will try our best as the @entity2 people to do it the soonest possible , " @entity1 said			1
" but the international community must have also the patience with us and the realization of the realities in @entity2			2
if it takes longer , then they must be with us			0
" @entity1 also offered his own timeline goal , saying @entity2 wants to be able to assume security control in some parts of the country in two years , and to lead security for the entire country by the end of his five - year term , which just started after his recent re-election			1
" we as @entity2 will try our very best to reach that goal , and we hope our allies will back us to reach that goal , " @entity1 said			1
later sunday , @entity12 's national security adviser , retired @entity48 gen. @entity47 , told @entity0 's " @entity55 " that the july 2011 date was " not a cliff " for @entity3 withdrawal , but instead the start of a gradual slope for turning over security responsibility to @entity2			1
@entity12 " has also said that we 're not leaving @entity2 , " @entity47 noted , adding : " we are here to make sure that @entity2 succeeds			1
" to prepare his country , @entity1 said , he would do all he can to root out corruption and improve governance			2
he has fired corrupt officials already , he said , adding he is prepared to act against anyone proven to be breaking the law			0
however , he warned against other nations using the corruption as a political tool in making decisions about @entity2			2
and he said the @entity3 and its allies also must halt practices that contribute to corruption from outside the country or create what he called " parallel " governance issues			2
the main objective for @entity2 and its allies is to defeat terrorism and return peace to the nation , neighboring @entity77 and the region , @entity1 said			1
that means training @entity2 security forces , rebuilding the economy and other nation - building efforts , he said			2
" i have fired people and i will be firing people , " @entity1 said			2
he seemed to laugh when he was played a video clip of @entity87 press secretary @entity86 saying the @entity3 would bypass corrupt government officials if necessary			0
" @entity2 is a sovereign country , it has a sovereign government , it 's not an occupied country , " @entity1 said , adding that a foreign power ca n't undermine or go around the government to deal with whomever it chooses			1
top priorities on a " long list " of reforms include improving the rule of law , improving the judiciary , reducing bureaucracy that forces people to visit dozens of offices to get licenses , and other steps to make the government more transparent and simpler , @entity1 said			0
however , @entity3 secretary of state @entity107 said in interviews broadcast sunday that @entity1 still must prove he means what he says			1
" the proof is in the pudding , " @entity110 said on the @entity112 program " @entity113			0
" " we 're going to have to wait to see how it unfolds			0
" @entity3 assistance will be " based on a certification of accountability and transparency , " @entity110 said on the @entity119 program " @entity120 , " adding that " certain ministries ... @entity3 money will not be going to			0
" in his @entity0 interview , @entity1 said his government would welcome @entity130 supporters who had no ties to @entity132 or other terrorist networks , renounced violence and pledged to support the constitution			0
@entity110 told @entity112 's " @entity113 " that such reintegration might be possible with lower - level @entity130 members , but not the hard - core leadership			0
" we have no firm information whether any of those leaders would be at all interested in following that kind of a path , " @entity110 said			0
" in fact , i 'm highly skeptical that any of them would			0
" eradicating terrorist networks and helping @entity1 's government defeat the @entity130 insurgency are main goals of the @entity3 - led mission			2
approximately 1,000 @entity3 @entity48 are expected to deploy this month as the first wave of the new deployment , military officials say			0
the @entity154 may not deploy the first soldiers until at least march			0
testifying before a congressional committee last week , adm. @entity156 , chairman of the @entity157 , said a " significant " number of troops will arrive in the spring and summer , with the final troops moving to @entity2 by late summer or early fall			2
meanwhile , the @entity87 said @entity12 would meet with gen. @entity163 , the @entity3 commander in @entity2 , and @entity165 , the @entity3 ambassador in @entity166 , on monday			1
both are expected to testify before @entity168 this week			0
@entity110 and @entity170 secretary general @entity169 said friday that @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity177 member @entity175 are among at least 25 countries offering to send a total of 7,000 additional troops			0
