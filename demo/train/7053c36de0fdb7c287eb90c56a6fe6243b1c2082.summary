-- seeing the first set of images from the typhoon zone in the @entity4 is like experiencing a dreadful sense of @entity7 vu : flooded roads , fallen huts , small buildings with the rooftops ripped off , and dead animals littering the streets			1
if this devastation appears eerily familiar , it is because we also saw the same horrific spectacle last year when @entity18 struck			2
sadly , both the @entity4 and the rest of the world are proving slow in learning the most important lessons of these disasters			1
@entity23 , which means " smash " or " lash " in @entity4 , is a fitting name for the strongest typhoon to hit the @entity4 this year ( it is actually known as @entity29 by locals )			1
when it was first spotted by satellites several days ago , it was immediately likened to @entity18 , the super typhoon that killed more than 6,000 people last year			1
and while @entity23 did n't create a more - than - 20 - foot storm surge like @entity18 did , it has still left a trail of destruction in a region that was still recovering from the latest of what seems like an unending series of calamities			1
this time around , the country was a little better prepared			2
@entity18 was a huge embarrassment to the @entity4 government , with many survivors complaining about the slow delivery of relief and medical assistance in the aftermath of the disaster			1
indeed , one of the positive things to come emerge of the @entity18 catastrophe is that disaster preparation has become much more of a focus for the bureaucracy			0
this was evident over the past week as agencies and local authorities worked diligently to prepare for @entity23 's onslaught -- more than 650,000 @entity4 were already sheltered in evacuation centers as the storm hit , and relief goods were in place for quick distribution			1
meanwhile , government offices were used as disaster monitoring centers as politicians worked with disaster experts , news stations acted as weather channels , churches and other civic institutions readied relief operations , businesses offered discounts , and even communist rebels vowed to assist the victims			0
all this meant that the @entity4 was already on a disaster footing when the storm arrived , as disaster preparation became the catchphrase not just of good governance , but also citizen responsibility			1
for better or worse , this preparation and post-impact operations also became more militarized as civilian officials took a leaf out of the military handbook in implementing their plans			0
but while this certainly made agencies more efficient in coordinating their efforts , some residents have complained about the intense militarization in their communities created by what they see as the unnecessary troop deployments			0
unfortunately , while the additional manpower might have been welcome in some areas , in others , certain state agencies used the deployments to impose stricter control of communities			0
for example , some residents said they felt insulted about the reported military presence at the large shopping malls in @entity111 , apparently to prevent a repeat of the supposed looting that took place in the city last year , when desperate @entity117 survivors clamored for emergency supplies at supermarkets			2
the protection for big business contrasted with orders issued by local officials to clear the stalls of small vendors			0
but while a state understandably must be decisive when disaster is imminent , the focus on the immediate danger should not be allowed to distract from some of the underlying issues			0
for example , in the lead - up to @entity23 hitting , there was little mention of the fact that it took the president 11 months to approve the comprehensive rehabilitation plan for @entity18 - hit provinces , or that @entity4 governments for years have allowed large - scale logging operations			1
officials respond that it is a distraction to quibble over these issues when lives are at stake			0
now is not the time , they argue			0
in fact , quite the opposite is true -- now is exactly the time to discuss these issues , while @entity4 and international attention is focused on them			1
after all , the point of noting these issues is not to criticize the government for the sake of doing so , but to try to encourage debate on how to address the roots of the extreme weather disturbances that are wreaking havoc in developing countries like the @entity4			2
but this debate on the impact of storms like @entity18 and @entity23 should be taking place not just in the @entity4 , but overseas			1
while @entity4 have been preparing for some of the worst effects of our changing climate , global climate talks have been continuing in @entity173			2
and yet even though a year has passed since yet another disaster has claimed thousands of lives , global leaders appear to be making little concrete progress towards a deal that will require them to make greater commitment -- and invest more resources -- toward tackling climate change			0
as @entity23 crawled toward the @entity4 , the @entity183 announced that 2014 is " on track to be one of the hottest , if not the hottest " years on record			1
" the provisional information for 2014 means that 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all occurred in the 21st century , " @entity183 secretary general @entity187 said last week			0
" there is no standstill in global warming			0
" such realities should be all the reason the international community needs to push forward towards a substantive climate pact			0
too many governments -- in the @entity4 and beyond -- act as if disaster preparation only involves a few days of monitoring typhoons and deploying troops to disaster zones			2
it is this sort of narrow thinking that will leave more and more nations , developing and developed alike , to face the lashing of the next @entity23 .			2

@entity23 is the strongest storm to hit @entity4 this year
@entity210 : scenes of destruction are *reminiscent* of last year 's typhoon
@entity215 : @entity4 is better prepared this year
