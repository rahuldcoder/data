as claims of responsibility go , it is remarkably complex and perhaps asks more questions than it answers , hinting at the messy rivalry perhaps engulfing the jihadi world			1
@entity10 commander @entity9 's 12 - minute message declares brothers @entity11 and @entity13 to be -- in the group 's eyes -- " heroes " who " were assigned and accepted and fulfilled " a task			2
it claims that much of what remains of @entity22 's command was somehow involved in choosing the @entity24 magazine as a target			1
several times , it evokes the name of @entity29 , and his successor , @entity31 -- names that , in the current focus on @entity34 ' rampage across the @entity35 , seem almost to hail from a time of jihad past			2
a vital part of the claim is its insistence that @entity41 , the gunman who attacked the kosher grocery store , was not part of their operation , but his attack coincided with theirs as " good fortune			0
" @entity41 left a long video in which he pledged @entity50 , or allegiance , to @entity52 , the head of @entity34			0
this hints at the growing and deeply troubling " rivalry " of sorts between @entity34 and the older brand of jihad -- @entity22			1
while it seems at first bizarre that two groups with fundamentally similar goals would conflict , the differing worlds of @entity22 and @entity34 have been apparent for some time now			1
@entity10 's franchise in @entity65 , @entity63 , is hit by @entity67 airstrikes along with @entity34 , and both are described as terror groups by the @entity67 government , but the @entity22 affiliate does at times clash with @entity34 for territory and resources			1
last spring , @entity22 's leader , @entity31 , distanced himself from the newer , more savage hotheads of @entity34 , a move that guaranteed -- for now -- their paths would continue to diverge			1
@entity10 's message wednesday does n't spell out how to connect the dots concretely between the @entity13 brothers ' disturbed cries they were working for @entity22 in @entity83 and the @entity83 jihadis themselves -- that 's something investigators have to work on to prove			2
are there real and genuine logistical links between that @entity90 street and the radical cells training in the desert ? but it does make some intriguing claims that are partially backed up by suggestions from some officials			2
the @entity10 statement claims that the @entity98 was somehow involved operationally in the plan to target @entity24			1
that is a hugely potent statement			0
@entity102 , a recruiter and radical preacher for @entity22 and an @entity67 citizen of @entity83 heritage , has long been dead -- killed by an @entity67 drone strike in 2011			0
@entity11 and / or @entity13 were in @entity83 in 2011 , according to witnesses and officials , although investigators are still working out their exact movements , with @entity11 possibly there as early as 2009 when it is alleged he roomed briefly with @entity112 , the " underwear bomber " who targeted a plane to @entity115 in 2009			0
were @entity98 the organizer of the attack -- someone who laid on the logistical support , financing or chose the target as the @entity22 in the @entity122 statement suggests -- then the @entity13 brothers would have been dormant for three years before launching their attack on january 7			2
investigators will be desperate to know if there was any further contact between 2011 and the @entity90 attacks -- whether the orders and logistics were in place by 2011 , or further assistance or instructions came closer to the moment			0
were it the former , this would be a truly chilling sleeper cell -- idle for years , and then , at a moment 's notice , deadly			0
above all , wednesday 's long and florid statement shows an @entity22 desperate not to be eclipsed by its newer -- and at times , in the gruesome jousting of this world -- more radical cousin , @entity34			1
the names and faces of their leaders , alive and dead , live on , particularly that of @entity98 , who , it is said , " threatens the @entity150 both in his life and after his martyrdom			0
" it 's a chilling sign @entity22 may very much be a current and real danger .			0
