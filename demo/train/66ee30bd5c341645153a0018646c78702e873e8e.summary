he was sentenced in 1986 for those crimes , and served 25 years behind bars , according to the state 's @entity26 and @entity29 website			0
" it 's always sad when someone takes their own life , " said former @entity0 mayor @entity30 , who was in office at the time of the shooting			1
@entity30 's comment was an apparent reference to media reports that say @entity8 died of a drug overdose			2

@entity3 shot @entity8 and three other @entity45 - @entity44 teenagers on december 22,1984 , aboard a @entity47 subway car			1
the four victims said they were panhandling for money to play video games and had asked @entity3 for $ 5			1
