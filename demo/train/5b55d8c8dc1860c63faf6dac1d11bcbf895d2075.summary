-- the @entity2 government requested information on more than 20,000 @entity5 users in the first half of 2013 , according to the social network 's latest transparency report			1
this is @entity5 's second transparency report and it includes much more information than the first			1
in it , @entity5 shows the total number of requests made by each country , not just the @entity2			1
an alphabetized table of countries shows how many accounts were involved , and the percentage of requests that resulted in @entity5 turning over at least some of the desired information to that country			1
the @entity2 is the most interested in @entity5 user data			2
it made between 11,000 and 12,000 requests for information from more than 20,000 @entity5 accounts in the first six months of this year			0
( the government wo n't allow @entity5 to report the exact numbers , only ranges			0
) @entity5 complied with 79 % of @entity2 requests			2
seventy - one countries submitted requests to @entity5			0
there were more than 26,000 total requests impacting at least 38,000 individual users			0
@entity36 submitted the second largest amount of requests , followed by the @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			2
@entity43 has not yet released its report for the first half of 2013 , but in the second half of 2012 it fielded more than 21,000 requests from 31 countries for more than 33,000 different users			0
though transparency is the stated goal , people can only view @entity5 's report if they are logged onto the social network			1
in the report , @entity5 general counsel @entity55 said the company had high legal bars for the requests from governments , and emphasized that the company scrutinized each individual request			0
" we fight many of these requests , pushing back when we find legal deficiencies and narrowing the scope of overly broad or vague requests			0
when we are required to comply with a particular request , we frequently share only basic user information , such as name , " said @entity55			0
the report does not break out national security requests from the usual criminal inquiries , something that has drawn criticism from @entity43 in the past			1
in june , following public outrage over revelations regarding electronic surveillance by @entity2 intelligence agencies , @entity5 made a deal with the federal government about what information it could make public			2
after @entity5 coughed up its first transparency report , @entity43 released a statement criticizing the social network and the federal government because it did n't specify how many government requests were criminal versus national security related			1
" lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users			0
our request to the government is clear : to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests , including @entity99 disclosures , separately , " said @entity43			2
in a faq under its new transparency report , @entity5 does say that the " vast majority " of requests were about criminal cases			1
" we continue to push the @entity2 government to allow more transparency regarding these requests , including specific numbers and types of national security - related requests			1
we will publish updated information for the @entity2 as soon as we obtain legal authorization to do so , " reads the report .			0
