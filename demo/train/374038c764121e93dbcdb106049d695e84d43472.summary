@entity0 -- @entity2 came right out of the gate with a stab at self - deprecating humor			1
as @entity10 announced that " it is a pleasure to welcome @entity2 to the program this morning , " the camera cut to @entity2 sitting on the " today " show set in a sea of newspapers			1
not only did that allow the former @entity15 governor to poke fun at herself , it was also a thinly veiled nod to the morning 's high stakes competition with " @entity19 " guest host @entity20 , who famously could n't get an answer from @entity2 about what newspapers she read			1
tweet of the day : @entity26 congratulations @entity2 expanding on the laugh - at - herself theme , the camera later zoomed in on @entity2 , sitting in @entity10 's dressing room , writing notes on her hand with a sharpie			1
again , it was making light of another classic @entity2 moment , when she was busted with talking points for a speech written on her hand			2
" thanks for letting me crash your dressing room , " @entity2 said to @entity10			1
he thought it was funny , sort of			0
" technically , i did n't give you permission to be in there , " he said dryly			0
@entity2 's first assignment in this much - hyped stint as guest " today " show host was really as a guest			1
historian speculates : what if @entity2 had run this year ? she talked about @entity54 presidential front - runner @entity52 as if they 'd poured sour milk in her coffee			1
" anything is still possible			0
there can still be a bit of a shake - up			1
but the numbers are what the numbers are , " she said			0
when @entity10 pressed her , saying it " does n't sound like you 're happy with @entity52 as the party 's nominee , " @entity2 quickly responded with the bumper sticker line , " anybody but @entity72			1
" she had a warning for the next @entity54 vice presidential pick			0
" it does n't matter if that person has the national level experience or not , they 're going to get clobbered by the lamestream media , who does not like the conservative message			1
" yes , without a hint of irony , she took part in the longest running network morning show and whacked the mainstream media			0
@entity10 could n't help himself			2
" you are going to stick around for the 8a hour , which technically makes you part of the lamestream media , " he deadpanned			1
@entity2 's key moments how much more mainstream media can you get than standing on the plaza outside @entity96 's " @entity95 " tossing to the weather ? " it 's @entity98 's turn , so let 's get a check of the weather with @entity98 , " @entity2 said , throwing to @entity98			1
as guest host , @entity2 took part in three segments			2
in " @entity107 , " they cleverly brought up the buzz about @entity109 playing @entity110 in an upcoming movie as a way to pivot to @entity2 and the @entity114 movie " @entity115			0
" @entity2 repeated previous comments that she did n't watch the movie saying , " i 'm not going to waste my time there			0
" nevertheless , she did give @entity119 a thumbs down for her portrayal			0
she volunteered that she liked another actress known for her uncanny @entity2 impersonation			0
" i do have to admit that @entity124 has been pretty clever , " said @entity2			0
she also defended @entity126 's pregnancy weight gain			0
" how would you have felt had someone criticized you for gaining too much weight , " @entity10 asked @entity2			1
" i would have wanted to punch them in the neck , " she responded			0
@entity2 went on to say that this is only an issue " because that @entity134 image is full of itty - bitty people , " in the her next segment , she gushed over one of those itty - bitty @entity134 people , @entity137 , who is now pregnant with her fourth child			2
" keep going , keep going , the more the merrier , " @entity2 told @entity137 , as the daughter of @entity134 royalty - turned reality tv star promoted her book on how to host an economical party			1
" how do you do it with five ? " @entity137 asked @entity2 , gushing back , " i do n't know if i can handle four , " the only segment @entity2 technically co-hosted was on mothering teenage daughters			0
at the end , @entity149 got a real taste of what it 's like when @entity2 goes rogue			2
@entity2 kept talking as a visibly anxious @entity149 tried to go to commercial break			0
the normally unflappable @entity149 even made a caught - on - television face at either the floor director or the control room , as @entity2 continued to talk to the guests about children wanting boundaries from parents			2
back on the plaza , as she was saying goodbye to the " today " show gang , @entity10 asked how she enjoyed being " part of the mainstream media			2
" she called it " controlled chaos " and quoted race car driver @entity169 as saying , if things are in control , " you 're going too slow			2
" in the end , @entity2 seemed to have fun with her one - day appearance , but the real arbiter of that will be how she rated in this head - to - head competition with @entity20 on " @entity19			1
" after all , it was @entity2 herself who set it up that way , declaring " game on			0

@entity2 is facing off against @entity20 in competing guest hosting stints
@entity2 on @entity52 : " there can still be a bit of a shake - up " but points out numbers lead
@entity2 also took a *familiar* jab at the " lamestream media "
@entity2 told @entity96 's @entity10 that *tuesday* 's appearance on " today " was " controlled chaos "
