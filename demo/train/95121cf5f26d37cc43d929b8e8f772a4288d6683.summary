@entity0 , @entity1 -- as natural habitats disappear in @entity1 , baboons and humans are increasingly coming into close contact , and conflict			1
in @entity1 's @entity9 there has been a large - scale transformation of wild baboons ' natural habitat into land for housing , industry and agriculture , according to the @entity18 @entity17			1
the result is that wild baboons are surrounded by humans , which the researchers say is causing human - baboon conflict to escalate			1
but the problem is n't confined only to the @entity0 , as baboons are increasingly venturing into towns and villages across southern @entity1 in search of food , often leaving a trail of damage in their wake			1
in the farming village of @entity36 , a four - hour drive from @entity0 , baboons are a growing problem			1
while some local farmers say they want to shoot baboons found in the village , others favor a more sustainable solution			2
report : @entity46 gorillas may go extinct @entity47 , of advocacy group @entity48 , is known as the " @entity49 " back in @entity0			1
she has spent her career trying to protect the primates in the @entity9 , of which there are more than 400			0
in @entity36 , she sees an opportunity to tackle the problem before it gets out of hand			0
" what is so exciting about the @entity36 scenario is the fact that they are being extremely proactive , " @entity47 told @entity2			0
" in many of the other areas it 's been a long time , where baboons have become habituated and trained			2
now in @entity36 they are saying ' let 's stop this behavior quickly before it gets started , ' and that 's enormously exciting for me			0
" @entity47 has pinned her hopes on implementing a baboon - monitoring program in the village			1
at the @entity73 , just outside @entity36 , @entity48 is training locals to be baboon monitors			1
the monitors are tasked with patrolling @entity36 and herding baboons away from homes and farms			1
" if we can get the monitoring program going quickly before the baboons are habituated i believe we stand a good chance of success here , " said @entity47			1
@entity86 runs the @entity73 and supports the village 's monitoring program			2
" i do n't think the baboon problem is going to go away , " @entity89 told @entity2			0
" it 's a learning curve			0
it 's something that 's happening here ; it 's happening all over @entity1			0
" an existing monitoring program on the @entity0 is yielding benefits			2
statistics from the @entity17 show human - induced injuries to baboons are at their lowest for five years			1
deaths are also down , and the baboon population is up , which means encounters with humans are more likely			2
@entity46 football academy creates future stars when she 's not helping to run monitoring programs , @entity47 takes tourists on walks around the @entity9 to see baboons in what she hopes will be their natural habitat			1
but despite the monitors ' best efforts , the baboons sometimes stray from their natural environment			1
the smell of cooking , and windows left open , are practically an invitation to hungry baboons , whose food raids can result in damage to property			1
" when i take people to walk , i never describe baboons as something they are not , " said @entity47			2
" they do cause incredible damage , and the ideal thing would be for them to be on the mountain and not in the village			0
" the monitors can struggle without a doubt			2
what 's frustrating to me is to see the residents make little effort to help the monitors			2
if they were working with the monitors more , the monitors would be more efficient			0
" when it comes to taking on one of the continent 's most opportunistic animals , researchers and advocates say there are no easy answers			0
" baboons are definitely incredibly opportunistic and incredibly adaptable , so from a management point of view it makes it incredibly difficult , " said @entity47			0
but she said it 's these same characteristics that drew her into a life of advocacy for baboons			0
" it is hugely amazing to watch how these baboons will adapt to a situation and will seize an opportunity and work with whatever they 've got , " she told @entity2			0
" i think we 've got a lot to learn from them , in hopes of showing more people the positives in an animal so often labeled a problem			0
" @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report			0
