the @entity0 in @entity1 recently announced that it will no longer hire smokers			1
a job applicant must be tobacco - free for six months to qualify for a position there			2
this decision will surely prove popular			0
defending the dirty habit of smoking is now left to fat cat lobbyists , highly paid lawyers with no conscience and far - right - wing crackpots			0
i am not in those ranks			0
( full disclosure : i was a former employee of the university			0
) but , keeping smokers out of the hospital work force unless it protects patients makes me very nervous			1
ethically , it is hard to digest			1
@entity22 is not the first health care institution to go tobacco - free in hiring			2
the @entity25 did so back in 2007			0
the @entity26 in northern @entity27 has had such a policy complete with required nicotine testing for more than a year			0
hospitals and health systems in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 have all stopped hiring smokers			1
lots of companies outside health care are not hiring smokers either , but the big push is in hospitals and health systems			1
so what is wrong with not hiring those who engage in ( or have engaged in ) a gross , sickening , bad habit ? in justifying its decision , @entity22 says smoking and secondhand smoke contribute to 443,000 premature deaths a year and cost $ 193 billion in health care and lost productivity			2
so , clearly they want to try and make a dent in that bill by barring tobacco users			2
in addition , @entity22 notes on its website that , " employees who smoke cost , on average , $ 3,391 more a year for health care			0
in addition , smoke breaks during work may be disruptive and subject patients / colleagues to the unpleasant smell of smoke on employees ' scrubs and clothing			0
" so the two big reasons are making a dent in a costly bad lifestyle choice and saving money for the health care system by hiring tobacco - free employees			0
i am not sure if i buy the smoke break disruption or the smelly clothes arguments			0
if they are problems , then send the smokers outside to a spot far away from where the patients come in and out , or have them wash their hands and faces , which everyone ought be doing anyway , and only give them the same breaks from work that everyone else gets			1
it comes down to a matter of fairness			0
why ca n't the hospital work with people who may want to change their behavior but are having a hard time doing so ? there 's a little hypocrisy when as a place where you bring people back from sickness to health , your policy seems to reflect little concern for getting health care workers to become healthier			1
i do n't doubt smokers cost us all a lot of money			1
it is also cheaper not to have to hire them and give them insurance or see them miss work			2
but the obese , the gamblers , rugby players , skiers , the sedentary , the promiscuous who do n't practice safe sex , those who wo n't wear helmets on motorcycles and bikes , horseback riders , pool owners , all - terrain - vehicle operators , small - plane pilots , sunbathers , scuba divers , and surfers -- all of whom cost us money and incur higher than average health care costs -- are still on the job			1
picking on the smokers alone is simply not fair			0
and what message does a no - smokers - are - welcome policy send ? we do n't want you in our health care system ? should n't doctors and nurses learn to work with those who sin and stray from the dictates of good health ? as long as those who have bad habits are not compromising the quality of health care being provided on hospital ground , then let 's not exclude smoking nurses , fat physical therapists , and scuba diving pharmacists from work			1
what is the best way to get a doctor or nurse who smokes to stop ? make sure they can not get a job ? oh yeah -- that will surely make them kick the habit ! why not hire them , tell them they have to get into anti-smoking programs and pay them a bonus when they stay smoke - free ? not hiring smokers at hospitals does send a message -- but it is n't one that hospitals and health systems ought to be sending .			1

the @entity0 said it will no longer hire smokers
@entity192 : keeping smokers out of the hospital work force is ethically hard to digest

@entity192 : should n't doctors and nurses learn to work with those who stray from good health ?
