just yards from where thousands of pro-democracy supporters have been " occupying " the heart of @entity4 's financial district , stands an imposing gray building surrounded on all sides by a high wall -- this is the @entity4 garrison of the @entity8 , @entity9 's armed forces			1
the main gates of the base , known as the @entity13 barracks until @entity14 handed over the city to @entity16 in 1997 , are guarded by heavily armed sentries in green combat fatigues , who stand statue - like with impassive expressions 24 hours a day , seven days a week			0
but despite the fact @entity4 is a @entity9 territory , the @entity8 garrison abides by local @entity4 laws that emphasize the city 's considerable autonomy			1
in short they keep a low profile : the soldiers never come out onto the streets of the city , and there 's minimal interaction with the local population beyond the occasional open day			0
while there is nothing to suggest this will happen , the possible intervention of the 6,000 @entity8 troops believed stationed here has been the " elephant in the room " for many , as we approach the first full week of pro-democracy demonstrations			1
for some protesters , memories are still fresh of 1989 and the brutal crackdown of student protests in @entity16 's @entity47			1
@entity8 arrives it was july 1 , 1997 when the main force of @entity9 soldiers rolled across the border from the southern @entity9 city of @entity52 into @entity4 , as @entity53 formally ceded control of the territory it had controlled since 1841			2
despite heavy rain , the convoy of green military trucks filled with soldiers clutching their rifles was met by crowds waving the flag of the nascent @entity63 of @entity4 : a white five - petal bauhinia flower on a red background			0
they headed for @entity67 and their new base , which had earlier been vacated by a @entity53 military detachment and was now flying the flag of the @entity9			0
the barracks , located in @entity4 's @entity73 , are the garrison 's headquarters but many @entity8 personnel -- particularly naval and air force units -- are stationed at smaller facilities across the territory			1
while troop numbers remain constant , the garrison 's personnel are frequently rotated in and out of @entity4			2
according to the city 's governing legislative council , the first rotation was conducted in 1998 and 12 rotations have been made since then			0
opinion : @entity88 : emotion ' will get us nowhere ' non interference under the newly - created " @entity100 , " a constitutional agreement that came into effect on july 1 , 1997 , the @entity8 garrison -- a mixture of personnel from @entity8 navy , ground and air forces -- is responsible for defense and to maintain the sovereignty , unity and territorial integrity of the @entity105 and the security of @entity4			1
while @entity113 of the @entity100 stipulates that the garrison " shall not interfere in the local affairs of @entity4 , " the @entity4 government " may , when necessary , ask the @entity107 ( @entity16 ) for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and disaster relief			1
" it then adds , " the garrison shall perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of the national laws that the @entity107 decides to apply in @entity4 in the event that the @entity124 of the @entity125 decides to declare a state of war or , by reason of turmoil within @entity4 which endangers national unity or security and is beyond the control of the @entity132 , decides that @entity4 is in a state of emergency			2
" however , @entity16 has been at pains to emphasize that the current situation in @entity4 is the responsibility of the local authorities to address			0
since 1997 , @entity9 's military presence in @entity4 has been largely anonymous with little revealed about its daily operations -- with the exception of open days , when the city 's population is invited into the @entity8 's barracks and given the opportunity to see its weaponry and meet soldiers			2
however , there have been signs in recent months that the @entity8 has started to be more high profile , with regular visits to the city 's @entity151 by warships			0
recent accounts of armored vehicles rumbling between bases across the city has prompted many to speculate whether this is a deliberate ploy by @entity16 to make its presence felt .			0
