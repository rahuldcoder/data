passengers aboard a sinking @entity2 ferry faced a terrifying choice as the vessel rolled : obey commands barked over loudspeakers to stay in place , or don life vests and jump into the chilly ocean water			1
" do n't move , " a voice warned , according to a recording obtained by @entity13 affiliate @entity12			2
" if you move , it 's dangerous			2
" that announcement , some witnesses worried , may have cost some passengers on the ferry sewol their lives			1
" kids were forced to stay put , " one survivor told @entity13 affiliate @entity12 , " so only some of those who moved survived			1
" as rescuers searched the frigid water for nearly 300 people who remained unaccounted for , witnesses told horrific stories of their final minutes on the sinking ship			1
" we were told to stay where you are , so we kept staying , " survivor @entity34 told @entity12			1
" but later on , the water level came up			2
so we were beside ourselves			2
kids were screaming out of terror , shouting for help			1
" at least some of those who jumped or made their way to the top of the ship were rescued			2
helicopter crews plucked some from the deck			2
others were pulled from the water by rescuers aboard the multitude of fishing boats and military vessels that raced to the scene as the ship rolled over and capsized			2
" i had to swim a bit to get to the boat to be rescued , " @entity54 , one of more than 300 @entity56 high school students who was aboard the ship for a four - day field trip , told @entity13 affiliate @entity12			2
" the water was so cold and i wanted to live			0
" nine have been confirmed dead , officials said thursday			1
as of 10:45 a.m. ( 9:45 p.m. et wednesday ) , of the 475 people who were aboard the ferry when it capsized , there were 287 people missing , and 179 people had been rescued , the coast guard said			1
police are questioning the boat 's captain , and maritime police are investigating safety and rescue conditions aboard the ferry , @entity12 reported			1
the captain had few words for the public			1
" i 'm sorry , i have nothing to say , " the captain said , according to @entity2 tv network @entity83			1
a massive rescue operation resumed early thursday after a delay of several hours , the @entity85 told @entity13			0
the reason for the delay was unclear			0
dozens of military divers , sailors , marines and police officers were assisting in the effort			0
but cold water , swift currents and low visibility appeared to be complicating the rescue operation			0
water temperatures in the area are between 50 and 55 degrees @entity103 ( about 10 to 13 degrees @entity104 ) , @entity13 meteorologist @entity100 said			0
helicopters took off from the @entity107 ship @entity108 thursday to support search efforts , said lt. @entity110 , spokesman for the @entity107 in @entity2			0
the @entity112 ship also has divers aboard who could help with searching if @entity2 's government requests it , he told @entity13 's " @entity116			0
" " from the images that i 've seen , there 's clearly some areas of the hull that are above the water , that are not flooded , " @entity117 , the @entity107 deputy director for salvage and diving , told " @entity125			0
" " so absolutely , there could be areas in there where there is breathable air , but the trouble right now is the temperature and getting people to them			1
" rescuers are " up against every sort of obstacle , " said @entity137 , director of special projects at the @entity139			0
" it 's just an absolutely , positively horrific situation , " he said			0
" ' we are not dead yet ' passengers texted a tilt and a bang it began as a routine ocean trip on calm seas			1
passengers bound for a resort island were just stirring , some eating breakfast			0
the ship ran into trouble just before 9 a.m. as it steamed toward to @entity156 , a resort island considered the @entity157 of @entity2			1
@entity158 told @entity12 that he was eating breakfast in the ship 's main hall when he felt the ferry begin to tilt			1
someone made the announcement telling passengers to stay in place			1
then , he said , he heard a loud bang			0
@entity54 , the rescued student , told @entity12 he heard the bang before the ship began to list			0
the tremors knocked shipping containers off balance , he said			0
" the students were falling over and crashing into things and bleeding , " @entity54 said			0
he obeyed orders to stay on the ship until rescuers arrived , threw him a life jacket and told him to jump			1
the water , he said , was " unbearably cold			0
" cell phone video believed to have been taken from inside the ferry shows people wearing life jackets and waiting			1
at first , survivor @entity187 said she listened to orders to stay put			1
" but suddenly , the water came up to my face , " she told @entity12			0
" so i think it was a narrow escape from dying			0
" can they survive in air pockets ? why were passengers told to stay put ? the warning over the ferry 's loudspeakers may have put passengers ' lives at risk , said @entity202 , a @entity13 analyst and former inspector general for the @entity112 @entity204			1
" i think the instruction for those people to remain in place and not get on lifeboats was terribly , tragically wrong , " she said			1
@entity209 , governor emeritus of the @entity210 , said that when crew members aboard the ship issued that warning , it might have been the best course of action			0
" the master of the ship , the captain , may well have determined that the vessel was going to remain level and might sink at a steady rate that would allow for the safe exit of people off of the vessel using life rafts , for example , and that would be the preferred way to go , " he said			1
" it may well be that the announcement was made while the captain was under the impression that the vessel was not going to sink quickly			1
and that events overtook their ability to communicate a change in direction to the passengers			0
" massive damage ? what caused the ship to sink is unknown			0
it capsized within two hours of its first distress call , which came just before 9 a.m. , @entity239 reported @entity242 , a retired @entity243 captain , said the speed with which the ship sank suggested it had sustained " major damage			1
" it most likely struck something in the water , @entity242 said			0
making matters worse , the ferry carried dozens of vehicles			2
once an auto deck is breached , " it 's typically open to very significant flooding , " @entity242 said			0
that could explain " why the ferry in just a matter of hours began to roll onto its side so quickly			2
" as authorities searched for answers , heartbroken family members of the missing gathered in @entity265 , about 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) from the site where the ferry sank			1
@entity268 turned to anger for some , who accused authorities of not doing enough			0
coast guard boats took some family members clamoring for answers out to the site of the shipwreck early thursday			1
one mother shared a text message she said her son apparently sent hours after the ferry sunk			2
" ca n't see a thing , it 's totally dark , " the message said			0
" we are not dead yet , so please send along this message			2
" survivors tell of panic on board as ferry tilts , then capsizes			2
