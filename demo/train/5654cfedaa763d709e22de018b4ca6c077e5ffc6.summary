two former guests have sued the proprietors of @entity3 ' @entity2 , where a 21 - year - old woman 's corpse was found floating in a rooftop water tank			1
the lawsuit was filed tuesday in @entity8 by @entity9 and @entity10			2
deeming it a " class action , " the complaint specifies it could apply to " all persons similarly situated " -- meaning anyone who stayed at the hotel between february 1 and 19 this year			1
for as long as 19 days , @entity17 's decomposing body was in one of the hotel 's four cisterns while the @entity21 and other guests below drank cups of water , bathed and brushed their teeth			1
how did woman 's body come to be in @entity29 hotel water tank ? a maintenance worker , checking on complaints about the hotel 's water , found the young @entity37 tourist on february 19 , @entity31 sgt. @entity30 said			1
the lawsuit claims the hotel effectively contracted with its guests to provide water " fit for human ingestion and human consumption through showering " -- an obligation that the @entity21 allege the hotel did not meet			1
" instead , the defendants provided water that had been contaminated by human remains and was not fit for human ingestion or to use to wash , " the lawsuit states , claiming the @entity21 believe that water was " tainted			1
" the @entity3 @entity51 immediately tested the water supply , but told the manager they could stay open as long as they provided bottle water and warned guests not to drink the tap water			1
the results of the testing showed no harmful bacteria in the tank or the pipes , according to @entity63 , director of environmental health for the department			2
chlorine in the city 's water may be the reason it is safe , he said last week			1
the hotel did not immediately respond thursday to a @entity73 request for comment			0
hotel with corpse in water tank has notorious past new guests continued to check into the @entity80 in the hours after firefighters removed @entity83 's body from the water tank			1
but each guest was asked to sign a waiver releasing the hotel from liability if they become ill. " you do so at your own risk and peril , " the hotel 's release said			2
guests who already paid for their rooms would not get refunds if they moved out , it said			0
in their lawsuits , the @entity99 ask for a refund of the $ 150 total they paid to stay two nights -- checking in february 12 and checking out february 14 -- at the @entity2			2
they also are seeking medical costs of approximately $ 100 and possibly more , if needed ; court and attorney fees ; and any " further relief as this court may deem just and proper			0
" @entity83 checked into the @entity2 on january 26 , on her way to @entity110 , @entity111 , according to police in her hometown of @entity115 , @entity116			2
five days later , she was seen on a security camera video walking into the elevator , pushing the buttons for four floors and then peering out of the opened elevator door as if she is hiding or looking for someone			0
clad in a red hoodie , @entity83 at one point walks out of the elevator before returning to it , pushing the buttons again			0
she then stands outside the open elevator doorway , motioning with her hands , before apparently walking away			0
it was the last day @entity83 was seen			0
authorities still have not officially determined how she died			0
@entity3 robbery - homicide detectives are treating this as a suspicious death for obvious reasons , since falling into a covered water tank behind a locked door on top of a roof would be an unusual accident , said @entity31 sgt. @entity30			2
an autopsy has been completed , but the cause of death is deferred pending further examination , assistant chief coroner @entity144 said last week			0
that may take six to eight weeks			0
any marks , injuries or wounds may suggest @entity83 died elsewhere and was dumped into the tank by her killer			0
water in @entity83 's lungs could be a sign that she drowned , but it might not tell why she was inside the small tank .			1
