a 16 - year - old transgender girl in @entity1 is at the center of controversy after she was transferred to an adult prison , where she has been held for more than a month without criminal charges			1
" @entity12 , " as she is listed in court documents , has been in the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity1 , since april 8 , spending the majority of her time there in solitary confinement , her attorney said			1
" i tell myself that this is just a nightmare , but it does n't end			0
i know that i need to work on my issues and i want to , but this is not the place , " she wrote in an op - ed published in the @entity16 in late april			1
she was ordered to the women 's prison after the state @entity22 concluded that she was " dangerous to ... herself or others or can not be safely held , " according to the memorandum of the judge 's decision			1
@entity22 exercised a rarely used state law to persuade a judge to transfer the teen from its custody to the @entity32			1
the court 's decision cited a " history of assaultive behavior while in placement facilities , " which included at least 11 assaults against her peers and staff during her more than five years in @entity22 custody			1
the option to transfer " @entity12 " was set in motion by @entity22 commissioner @entity45 after the teen 's latest assault on a female staff worker during an out - of - state stint at a juvenile facility in @entity51			1
the incident left the staffer with a concussion and bite marks , according to reports , though no charges were pressed for the assault			0
" her behavior was more severe than other residents ... ( and ) made her especially dangerous and difficult to secure , " according to testimony by a juvenile detention supervisor			1
' we 're not in @entity65 ' a grassroots movement has been launched for the teen , demanding her release from prison			2
" we 're not in @entity65			0
we 're in @entity1 , in a constitution state			2
this is nothing short of human rights abuse , " @entity71 , the teen 's attorney , told @entity73			2
" my client is an emotionally distressed child who has been victimized by people over and over again			2
she 's not charged with a crime , yet she was locked down in isolation , with a concrete block for her apartment , watched by guards 22 hours a day , even while she showered ... isolated from the rest of the world , " @entity71 said			2
this week , the teen was moved to a separate facility within the prison with " a bedroom , private bathroom and a programming / recreation area , " @entity22 spokesman @entity85 said			2
@entity12 's case has drawn attention statewide and beyond , with her supporters launching protests in @entity96 and outside @entity22 headquarters in @entity1			1
the hashtag # @entity98 was trending this month on @entity100			0
" i think from the statements the ( @entity104 ) commissioner has made , it 's clear on a fundamental level she does not understand @entity12 in a sympathetic light			1
she does not see her as a vulnerable person -- she sees her as a monster essentially , " @entity107 , staff attorney with the @entity109 's @entity108 , told @entity73			0
" you can see they are just using solitary confinement as default placement so they do n't have to figure out questions about where to safely house transgender individuals , " @entity107 said			0
" but we have federal law and we have our constitution that requires that these institutions and agencies take seriously the obligation to keep people safe			0
placing people in solitary confinement does not meet that obligation			0
" governor 's support despite the controversy surrounding the @entity22 commissioner 's suggestion to transfer the teen to an adult prison , @entity45 has received support from @entity1 gov. @entity140 , who oversees the agency			1
" the governor thinks the commissioner has done phenomenal work to transform an agency that is one of the most difficult in state government , " @entity142 , a spokesman for @entity143 , told @entity73			1
" no one thinks this is a good option for the teen , and we 're working on a good resolution , " he added			0
" i admit that i have acted out and got into fights , " @entity12 wrote in her op - ed in the @entity16			1
" i am not saying it was ok , but i have a lot of stuff built up inside me and do n't know how to deal with it at times			0
they tell me that trauma changes people and makes them act out			0
believe me , it does			0
i have n't agreed with everything @entity22 has done , but i thought they were supposed to be on my side , " she wrote			0
@entity71 , @entity12 's attorney , says he is suing the state for her release			1
" we are looking at other options for @entity12 that will better meet her treatment needs , " @entity22 spokesman @entity85 said			2
