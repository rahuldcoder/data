-- president @entity1 embarked thursday on his first presidential visit to @entity3 , an eight - day journey that will take him to five cities in four countries			1
throughout the trip to @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , @entity1 will emphasize the importance of @entity16 nations as vital @entity18 partners on major issues such as economic growth , nuclear nonproliferation , the war in @entity23 and climate change , three officials said in a briefing this week			1
the presidential itinerary includes formal talks with @entity16 leaders as a group and individually , a bilateral meeting with @entity32 president @entity31 , and the first participation by a @entity18 president in a summit of the 10 - member @entity38 economic alliance			2
the itinerary also reflects @entity1 's personal ties to @entity3 , where he spent part of his childhood			1
he will have a bilateral meeting with president @entity44 of @entity45 , where @entity1 lived from 1967 to 1971			2
as the first @entity18 president with " an @entity56 orientation , " @entity1 " understands that the future of our prosperity and our security is very much tied to this part of the world , " said @entity46 , deputy national security adviser for strategic communications			1
it wo n't be all diplomatic meetings , though			0
@entity1 's first trip to @entity12 will include a " town hall " style meeting in @entity61 and sightseeing in @entity63			1
while in @entity10 he 'll meet the emperor and empress , according to @entity46			2
@entity1 's departure was delayed one day to allow his attendance at tuesday 's memorial service at @entity70 in @entity71 for the 13 people killed in a mass shooting there last week			1
the revised itinerary cut a day from the stop in @entity11 , @entity76 press secretary @entity75 said earlier this week			2

the agreement was met with fierce local opposition			0
increasing @entity18 exports to a region expected to grow by more than 7 percent next year will also be an important topic , said @entity121 , deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs			1
@entity3 " already takes about a quarter of our exports , and those exports are expected to increase as the region grows " @entity121 said			0
the result could be an increase of " hundreds of thousands " in the current 1.6 million @entity18 jobs linked to @entity16 exports , he said			0
the officials were careful to avoid any perception that @entity1 's presence at the @entity38 meeting would amount to a bilateral discussion with the prime minister of @entity138 , who also will attend			1
after years of refusing direct talks with @entity138 , also known as @entity138 , the @entity18 has indicated a possible re-engagement with the military regime it considers repressive for cracking down on political opposition , including the @entity144 led by detained @entity146 winner @entity145			0
" the statement we 're trying to make here is that we 're not going to let the @entity138 tail wag the @entity38 dog , " said @entity147 , the @entity148 's senior director for @entity16 affairs			0
" we 're going to meet with all 10 and we 're not going to punish the other nine simply because @entity138 is in the room , but this is not a bilateral [ meeting ]			0
" in @entity12 , @entity1 will continue efforts to define and strengthen the relationship with the world 's largest emerging economy , which has a growing influence in @entity3 , @entity147 said			1
" we see it as a relationship where we 're obviously going to have differences , where we are going to be competitors in certain respects , " he said			0
" but we want to maximize areas where we can work together because the global challenges will simply not be met if we do n't			0
" @entity147 cited @entity170 's nuclear weapons program , the economy , climate change , human rights and @entity23 as among the top issues for the @entity12 swing			2
on human rights , @entity147 said @entity1 is likely to address " freedom of expression , access to information , freedom of religion , rule of law , and certainly @entity181			0
" @entity1 will make clear to @entity88 that he intends to meet in the future with the @entity183 , the exiled @entity184 spiritual leader , @entity147 said			1
@entity12 , which rejects @entity184 aspirations for autonomy , opposes such high - level contacts with the @entity183			0
