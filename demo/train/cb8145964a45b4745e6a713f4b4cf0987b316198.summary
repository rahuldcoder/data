@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 used two cots as shelter over his head and a third to shield him from the drenched earth			1
the 80 - year - old man was among thousands in @entity0 who could see his home submerged under water -- about half of the @entity1 town looked more like a lake than a community of people			1
even the mosque was under water and people were using boats to rescue their cows , goats and sheep , dragging the terrified animals onto dry -- or at least dryer -- land			2
@entity0 , in @entity1 's @entity28 province , is one of many villages , towns and cities across @entity1 reeling from torrential monsoon rain and flooding that authorities now say have affected 12 million people and killed as many as 1,500			1
@entity1 's disaster management authority estimated that 650,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed			1
by comparison , the earthquake of 2005 affected 3.2 million people and damaged or destroyed 611,000 homes			2
and no relief is in sight as the bloated @entity44 overflows its banks and more rain continues to fall			2
@entity1 's @entity47 issued an alert for the southern province of @entity50 , far away from the northern @entity51 , where the crisis began			1
" @entity1 has been hit by the worst flood of its history , " said prime minister @entity53 in a televised speech friday			1
" as i speak , the flood is still engulfing new areas and adding to the scale of devastation			2
" @entity53 said a true assessment of the loss to life and infrastructure can be determined only after the water recedes			2
he appealed to the international community and to @entity1 living abroad to dig deep into their pockets			1
relief agencies said donations are needed urgently to alleviate suffering			2
@entity70 has worked for the @entity71 for 15 years and been involved in other disasters			0

people ca n't go back to their homes			0
they are living in a precarious situation			0
" he said there has been a conspicuous absence of aid in some areas , despite efforts by the @entity71 and other international aid groups			1
parts of the @entity51 remain inaccessible by road ; helicopters provide the only way in or out for people , food , clean water or medicine			0
at @entity100 , south of the valley 's largest city , @entity99 , people queued for more than four hours to cross a rickety temporary suspension bridge above swirling brown water			0
with the main highway crossing destroyed , people trying to escape were using a decrepit @entity106 - built 19th century bridge that was damaged in the rain			0
meanwhile , among the suffering , anger grew at the government for perceived lack of action			0
@entity1 hurled stinging criticism at president @entity114 , who was in @entity115 for talks with @entity106 prime minister @entity117 during the worst of the crisis			1
advisor @entity119 said @entity114 was simply doing his job as head of state and had ensured the crisis at home was being adequately addressed by the prime minister			0
in @entity0 , there were few signs of aid for the flood - displaced and frustration mixed with drizzle in the air			1
" we elected him , " one man said about @entity114			0
" where is he ? " @entity138 emergency relief teams were continuing to arrive in @entity139 for distribution by @entity1 's @entity141 , the @entity136 said friday			1
