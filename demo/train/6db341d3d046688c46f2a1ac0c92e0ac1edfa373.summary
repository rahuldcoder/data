-- in @entity3 business great ceos embody their companies			0
they persuasively connect their companies ' brands to the emotions , desires , aspirations and , yes , the fears and challenges of consumers -- men and women alike			1
@entity15 of @entity16 , @entity17 of @entity18 , @entity19 of @entity20 , @entity21 of @entity22 all come to mind			0
a great ceo is a company 's no. 1 salesperson			0
yet @entity27 ceo @entity26 has showed himself as just the opposite , last week whipping up the justified anger of women in the workforce with advice that they should wait patiently for pay raises			1
at thursday 's global conference of women in tech , dedicated to the memory of a legendary female computer scientist , @entity39 , @entity26 -- the first ever male keynote speaker -- was responding to a query on advice for women who are uncomfortable asking for raises and promotions			1
he told conferees : " it 's not really about asking for the raise , but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along			0
" he later added that such restraint is " good karma			0
it 'll come back because somebody 's going to know that 's the kind of person that i want to trust			0
" how could @entity26 be so -- putting it charitably -- tone - deaf ? at the very least , he was unprepared : a great ceo is always ready to be put on the spot , to answer questions on a tough subject from his corporate vantage point as a powerful leader			1
the big stunner for the headlines , however , was that @entity26 revealed a remarkable level of insensitivity and ignorance about the huge barriers women face in the workplace			1
the immediate backlash showed just how out of step he is with the reality faced by a substantial chunk of his workforce talent every day as it tries to advance up the ladder of success at @entity27			2
for women , his comments are a reality check -- a clear sign that even though the general consciousness about women , work and equality is higher than ever , so much remains to be done			2
more than ever , women need to stand up , be heard and challenge the prevailing attitudes that maintain unequal treatment			1
@entity26 's company , for example , recently reported dismal statistics on the number of women in its management ranks			1
@entity27 revealed that while women make up 29 % of its total workforce , they are 17 % of its leadership -- the lowest among their tech peers , though by a slim margin of 4 percentage points			1
the " system " @entity26 wants women to depend upon at @entity27 has not been kind			1
@entity108 writes in the november issue of @entity111 magazine that it has rested on a leadership culture embodied by @entity26 's predecessor , @entity113 , that drove , according to one person interviewed for the article , " sub-optimal human behavior , " as well as behavior modeled by both @entity113 and @entity27 founder @entity118 that had , according to a former executive quoted , " too often crossed the line into abuse			1
" it 's not just @entity27			2
at @entity126 , women faculty disagreed with their male peers by a ratio of 2 - to - 1 " that the climate for female faculty in the @entity131 is at least as good as for male faculty			0
" just as meaningful as climate is access to powerful peers who decide whether nontenured faculty stay or go			0
the women faculty members said they felt excluded from an informal network that might improve the perception of their research or help them move up the ladder			0
@entity26 's remarks are also a call for women to be not just impatient about raises but proactive about compensation equality			1
money and representation equal power and mobility , especially among male - dominated groups			0
according to an article in the @entity155 , " women engineers make 89 cents for every dollar their male colleagues earn			0
" that reality is a result , in part , of the limited impact a minority group can have on a system when they are underrepresented in the power structure : five out of every six tech employees at @entity27 , @entity171 and @entity172 are male , the article says , quoting data from @entity126 economist @entity174			2
@entity26 hit a nerve because his offhanded remark revealed a truth , and women need to be vocal storytellers about how attitudes such as his can hold them back			1
they need to take action to support , encourage and network on these issues inside these corporate systems			0
after all , it is persistent challenges against defenses that ultimately change an organism			0
our experience working with women in companies in media , communications and consumer products suggest that they are coming together -- and with the support of male peers -- to share wisdom and raise awareness on issues of professional ethics and equality , including harassment , unequal compensation and negative stereotyping			2
in the entrepreneurial realm , nonprofit groups such as @entity208 and @entity209 give women - led startups access to venture capital , and raise awareness , through public relations , of the disproportionately low startup funding available to women entrepreneurs			0
as a society , we 've been at this now for years but , arguably , there 's never been a better , more opportune , time in history for women to be proactive and persuasive about changes that have to come about for everyone			2
male - dominated companies such as @entity27 stand to gain a lot by being proactive about equality : they can reduce expenses by limiting turnover , maximize the value of the investment in educating women and improve overall productivity and competitiveness			1
as they work toward this , one immediate change @entity27 might want to consider : hire an executive coach .			2
