the family trip to @entity4 that we 've been discussing , in part to visit @entity1 with the kids , might be off -- indefinitely			1
i relayed that news to my husband ( he was n't pleased ) after watching the stirring documentary " @entity10 , " which will be showcased on @entity11 at 9 p.m. et thursday			1
the film tells the story of the killing in 2010 of experienced @entity1 trainer @entity15 by a 12,000 - pound orca			1
you might be surprised to find out that the director of " @entity10 , " @entity10 , once would routinely take her kids to shows at @entity1 in @entity4			1
that was the case until that day nearly four years ago when the whale @entity15 trained and performed with in @entity23 pulled her underwater			0
the death led @entity10 to make a documentary , raising questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity over the past 39 years			1
the film includes interviews with a number of former @entity1 trainers , including one who said he would never take his child to @entity1			1
" i am not at all interested in having my daughter who is 3 - and - a - half grow up thinking that it 's normalized to have these intelligent , highly evolved animals in concrete pools , " said @entity38 , a former @entity1 trainer , who said he grew increasingly concerned about the stressful conditions the animals were living under at @entity1			1
" i do n't want her to think that 's how we treat the kin that we find ourselves around on this planet			0
i think it 's atrocious			0
" in conversations with parents across the country , most of whom had not seen the film and many of whom contribute to the parenting and lifestyle site @entity63 , i found strong differences of opinion about keeping animals in captivity and about taking kids to @entity1 as well as to zoos , circuses and aquariums			1
parents weigh benefits and costs of captivity @entity76 of @entity77 , who describes herself as a lifelong animal lover , took her four kids , 16 - year - old triplets and a 17 - year - old , to @entity1 every chance she could from the time they were very little			1
" since i love nature , i really wanted them to be exposed to that early , " the host of the blog @entity86 and social media strategist said in an interview			0
at a time when some species of whale are on the endangered list , @entity76 believes places such as @entity1 provide crucial education to children about whales			1
" we need to educate children about why these whales are so important , why they 're so beautiful , what their unique characteristics are , because these kids are also going to be the world 's future marine biologists , " she said			1
@entity108 , a mom of two who grew up in @entity23 , @entity110 , wholeheartedly agrees			0
" if we do n't give our children the opportunity to go visit them , how else would they learn about these animals ? " said @entity108 , who is a @entity63 contributor			2
" it 's a hands - on experience and a hands - on opportunity , too			0
" on the other side are moms such as @entity121 , who believes parents should not take their kids to @entity1 , circuses or other places where " animals are made to perform for the enjoyment of humans			1
" at a very young age , @entity129 was deeply affected by animals in captivity , begging her parents to take her home early after trips to the circus and @entity1			1
" i still have a photo of myself posing awkwardly in front of a lion standing on top of an elephant , and that bothered me so much , " the mom of two , social media strategist and contributor to @entity63 said			0
" i did n't really want to see the wild animals being made to do what people wanted them to do			2
" explaining @entity1 position to kids , other parents @entity129 's kids , 4 and 7 , have no issue with the family position of " no @entity1 , circuses and aquariums , " but other parents are a different story			1
an awkward conversation usually ensues when other families invite @entity129 and her kids along to an animal park or circus			2
" people are taken aback when you say , ' you know what , i do n't really agree with circuses or believe in them , so we 'll pass , ' " @entity129 said			0
" that always seems to shock people a little bit , at least i 've found			0
" @entity174 and her family have made a 180 - degree shift in terms of their feelings about places such as @entity1			1
@entity174 's daughter , now 22 , was obsessed with sharks and marine life in general beginning at 3 and dreamed of swimming with dolphins			0
so , at 10 , her parents took her to @entity1 to swim with the dolphins , and then at 16 , she swam with them again in the @entity187			1
but during her college years , she saw the documentary film " @entity190 , " which explores the killing of dolphins and porpoises in @entity194			0
" she was devastated by what she learned , " said @entity174 , a mom of three , blogger and food writer for @entity63			0
" she made every member of our family watch it ... and those issues became very much on our radar to the point where we stopped going to aquariums			0
" once " @entity10 " came out , they immediately went to see it and were deeply moved			1
" there 's not only no kind way , no humane way to keep ( whales ) in captivity			2
it is traumatizing to them , " @entity174 said			0
" once you know it , you ca n't ... unknow it and go with any kind of open mind or heart			0
" @entity1 's conservation efforts @entity76 , the @entity77 mom of four , says she feels bad when whales are captured or born into captivity , but she says they are not safe in nature , either , citing how some countries still permit their slaughter			1
places such as @entity1 , she says , are one of the few ways to preserve and protect each species of whale from extinction ultimately			2
" i think a lot of the anti-whale - in - captivity people are thinking that people are using them for entertainment value and for their own selfish purposes , but i think it 's really important from the educational aspect			2
" also missing from the discussion , said @entity23 - native @entity108 , are the conservation efforts by @entity1 , which include taking in injured birds and animals and having staffers travel to beaches to recover stranded animals			1
" there is a controversy , " said @entity108			0
" at the same time , they are doing a lot of good to save a lot of animals that would be in danger or ... would n't survive in their natural habitats			2
" on the fence somewhere in the middle are parents such as @entity261 , who participated in coverage of the @entity1 2010 death during her time as a web producer for @entity265			1
@entity261 says she has to balance her concerns about animals in captivity with how certain places help endangered species continue to survive			2
she 's waiting until her two children , 11 months and 3 years old , get a bit older to decide whether animal parks are a potential family destination			0
" it 's easy to say , ' well , i 'm not going to visit any of these places ' " she said			0
" but when you have a child and you see his face light up at the sight of a four - legged furry thing , it 's hard to deny him that joy			0
" @entity261 , who is now a @entity63 contributor , also wonders what the alternatives would be if there were no @entity289 , zoos and aquariums , since most families ca n't afford to spend thousands of dollars on an @entity294 safari or on a whale - watching expedition			2
" i think ( kids ' ) universes of animals , or at least live animals , would be limited to the squirrels , cats and dogs in the neighborhood , which i think would be too bad for them because kids these days in general have a lot less exposure to wild animals than they did years ago , " @entity261 said			2
" and i think they are missing out because of that			0
" follow @entity311 on @entity312 and like @entity313 on @entity314 .			0
