-- can the media get over their collective obsession with weight ? fat chance			1
for some strange reason , here we are again , talking about @entity8 's derriere			1
and , for good measure , @entity10 's girth			1
watch : why is @entity12 highlighting @entity8 's rear ? it 's easy , it 's fun , it 's good for clicks and ratings			1
it 's also kinda cheap			2
the @entity12 used a pretty flimsy peg -- @entity22 high school football coach @entity21 caught on tape -- to run a style section piece on the weighty issue			0
" fat butt @entity8 , " the coach is heard saying , declaring her overweight			1
@entity21 was suspended by the school ( he says he misspoke )			0
but this is national news ? really ? talk back : should @entity10 be shamed into losing weight ? of course , the paper dressed it up with highfalutin ' sociology			1
" the focus on this first lady 's posterior has historical antecedents , " the article says , launching into questions about how black women have long faced scrutiny about their bodies			2
and yes , @entity43 and @entity44 rep. @entity44 have sounded off about @entity8 's bottom			1
and yes , the fact that she has mounted an anti-obesity campaign does sort of put her in the crossfire			0
watch : @entity10 's doughnut diplomacy with @entity51 but as the @entity12 acknowledges , @entity8 is a 5 - foot - 11 - inch woman with toned arms who is widely viewed as being in good shape			1
she 's not a triathlete ; she 's a working mother of two			2
so when the story asks , " what is it with @entity8 's critics and the fixation with her derriere ? " i would turn that question around			1
what is the media fixation with publicizing it every time some bozo sounds off about her backside ? this is an uncomfortable reminder that the media business celebrates models bordering on anorexic , making perfectly proportioned young girls and women feel heavy because they do n't have superthin ( and often airbrushed ) celebrity bodies			2
this may help promote the fashion industry , which considers normal women plus - size , but it bears little relation to real life			0
@entity10 is a different case			2
having endured endless jokes about his oversized frame , the @entity84 governor shrewdly decided the best path was to poke fun at himself			0
watch : is @entity89 over ? more friends taking ' vacations ' from site so he appeared on @entity51 's couch this week , one of his chief tormenters , and promptly shoved a doughnut into his mouth			0
he allowed that he did n't mind fat jokes if they 're funny			0
it was self - deprecating humor that showed @entity10 to be a real human being			1
but the truth is that the teasing does bother @entity10			2
and there is a serious question here beneath the laughter			0
@entity10 is grossly overweight , and his health would be a legitimate issue if he runs for president in 2016			1
which , as you may have noticed , is four years from now			0
doughnuts aside , @entity10 treated the matter more seriously at a news conference , saying that he 's " remarkably healthy " but that " my doctor continues to warn me that my luck is going to run out relatively soon			1
" the governor showed he had lost none of his feistiness after @entity126 , a former @entity127 physician , said on @entity0 : " i worry that he may have a heart attack , he may have a stroke			0
... i worry about this man dying in office			0
" @entity10 upbraided her wednesday for diagnosing him without an examination : " she must be a genius			2
she should probably be the surgeon general of the @entity136			0
" he said she was just another hack seeking " her five minutes on tv			0
" well , you started it with your doughnut diplomacy , governor			0
watch : @entity146 's plea to save newspapers ( and his strip ) if @entity10 becomes a @entity127 contender , everything is fair game			1
he can hardly complain about other folks after his " @entity156 " shtick			0
but i ca n't help but think it is easier for pundits to pontificate about @entity10 's weight than to examine his record in @entity163			1
everyone who has worried about those extra pounds can relate to the story , but the coverage is out of hand			0
if i never read another word about @entity8 's behind , i may go celebrate with a @entity170			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity173 : media obsessed with @entity10 and @entity8 's weight
@entity173 : @entity8 is 5 ' 11 " and in good shape despite comments about her rear
@entity10 's girth is serious , he says . if he runs for president his weight is fair game
@entity173 : media obsessed with weight , stick - thin models who border on anorexia
