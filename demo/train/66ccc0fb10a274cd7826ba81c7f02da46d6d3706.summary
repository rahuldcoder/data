@entity0 -- who am i ? i am an @entity4 from the soles of my feet to the hair that once adorned my bald head			1
an @entity4 whose black - skinned ancestors were stolen from their lives and cultures and piled in the holds of ships like so many sacks of skin			1
an @entity4 whose @entity17 ancestors stowed their lives into the holds of later vessels running from a thousand years of anti-semitism that was soon to blossom into a @entity23			1
an @entity4 whose ancestors walked across the frozen waters from @entity27 to @entity28 discovering a new world that would one day be stolen from their descendants			1
an @entity31 - speaking @entity4 whose language is also whispering @entity34 from my @entity36 relatives and sublime @entity37 from the @entity38 and @entity38 - @entity4 i rubbed shoulders with growing up in @entity40			1
a man whose music is the blues that became rock and roll and hip - hop , jazz that is the bastard and the heir of the unconsecrated coupling between @entity49 and @entity50			1
who am i ? i am a man formed by history but oddly lacking in a clear perspective of the past			1
a man with so much to me that there is no clear identity to grab onto or claim			1
i might be related to @entity58 or any of 10,000 masters who raped and sometimes even loved their slaves			0
who am i ? i am the target of ad men and pollsters , census takers and the evening news			0
to some i am the enemy , both inside this nation and internationally			0
to some i am a brother			0
i can be at the same time invisible and yet profiled , counted and yet forgotten , imprisoned by circumstance and yet declared free by one of the great documents of political history			2
i am prejudged for my skin color , gender , age , education , and even for some things that i 've done wrong			0
i am a minor shareholder in the great corporation of @entity28 and therefore responsible for everything good and bad that we 've done in the name of business , things we did before i was born and events that shall occur after i 'm gone			2
i am the amalgamation of all the ignorance , ambitions , yearnings for freedom , and religions of the world			0
i am -- have been -- brainwashed so many times that innocence is second nature to me			0
contradictorily , @entity28 is what i am but not my history , not my identity			1
i am a new man almost every day			0
i and mine were once colored , @entity100 , black , @entity101 , @entity101 , brother , sister , @entity103 , revolutionary , good one , bad one , convict , malingerer , miracle , and so much more			0
in the end i can say with conviction that i am @entity28			0
through my veins run 10,000 years of history that touches every continent , deity , and crime known to humanity			2
this history is not composed of the false accounts of the past ; it is the blood and the beat and the light that passes through my mind , and yours			2
i am your sibling whether you know it or not , whether you accept me or not			0
we , known and unknown to each other , form an identity that i can express but still not know , not completely			2
and for this state of being i am infinitely grateful because it means that i can be part of something greater than the individual , while still i am at home in my heart .			1
