@entity0 -- a group of elderly @entity3 who say they were tortured under @entity5 colonial rule are seeking compensation at @entity0 's @entity7 in a case that could expose the @entity5 to thousands of claims from across its former territories			1
four @entity3 , aged in their 70s and 80s , have traveled from their homes in rural @entity3 to press their claim that @entity5 is liable for the abuse they suffered during the @entity16 -- during which hundreds of ordinary @entity3 , including @entity18 's grandfather , were arrested			1
lawyers for the four say they suffered extreme acts of torture -- including castration and sexual assault -- at the hands of @entity5 administration officials in detainment camps during the uprising between 1952 and 1961			1
but @entity5 's @entity28 denies all liability and wants the judge to throw out the case on the grounds that all liability transferred to the @entity34 when the country gained independence in 1963			1
the case , which could set a precedent allowing thousands of former @entity5 subjects to claim compensation , has thrown new light on the country 's colonial past after a huge cache of secret files relating to @entity5 administration in 37 colonies was uncovered			1
the @entity28 has been ordered to produce all evidence relevant to the @entity3 case , including hundreds of boxes of files , secretly smuggled out of the country ahead of independence			1
these are said to contain graphic accounts of prisoner abuse			0
@entity1 's @entity55 , reporting from the @entity7 , said the files contained " pretty horrific detail			0
" despite the @entity5 government 's efforts to derail the case , @entity57 , one of the victims pursuing the claim , said he expected a ruling that would allow him to find closure			1
" i am confident the @entity5 government has elders who believe in justice and doing the right thing , they will listen to us and give us something that will help us in the remaining part of our lives , " he told @entity1			0
during the uprising , as many as 150,000 @entity3 were incarcerated in what was then @entity76 , accused of being members of the resistance movement started by marginalized tribes			2
among them were many ordinary citizens , including @entity82 president @entity18 's grandfather			1
@entity18 referred to his grandfather 's incarceration in his memoir " @entity85 , " writing that @entity86 , who fought with the @entity87 during @entity88 , was held for six months but found innocent			2
@entity89 , who is 83 this year , says he was detained without charge for nine years , beaten with sticks and forced into labor			0
he says he survived a massacre at one @entity5 - run camp after which he lay unconscious for three days alongside 11 people who were killed			0
" i suffered physical violence on my head , on my legs , i still have the scars today because of the beatings from the colonial administrators , " he told @entity96			0
" i am here to get justice for the many of my colleagues who have since died , and others who are still alive but living in abject poverty because of the injustices that were committed by the @entity5 colonial government			0
" it 's their responsibility to own up and pay us back now , compensate us , so that when i die , i do not have to keep telling my grandchildren of the injustices that were done			0
" in a statement , the @entity28 said it welcomed debate @entity3 's colonial past , but it intended to defend the case			2
" we understand the strong feelings that the @entity16 issue still creates in @entity3 and elsewhere			2
it remains a deeply divisive issue within @entity3 and one on which historians continue to debate , " it said .			0
