with computer technology advancing at an ever bewildering pace , it 's comforting to know that one little feature remains steadfastly future - proof and , more importantly , foolproof			2
the usb ( @entity6 ) is as relevant today as it was when the 12 millimeter by 4.5 millimeter ports and cables first started appearing back in the late 1990s , providing users with a discreet and straightforward way of transferring data between a range of digital devices			1
today , more than 10 billion usb devices are believed to be in use around the world -- a statistic that has secured its co-inventor , @entity19 , a permanent place in computing 's unofficial hall of fame			1
" i was totally surprised by how it has impacted everybody			0
i mean , my name became a common name -- at least at schools and in technical communities , " @entity19 said			1
the engineer 's high standing in computing circles was famously celebrated in a 2009 advertising campaign by his employers , @entity34 , where an actor portraying @entity19 strutted into a lab full of starstruck co-workers			1
" i truly get a rock star treatment and that is quite unusual to me -- people asking for your signature , people asking for your picture			0
" his journey to digital immortality began in the early 1990s amid the growing tangle of chunky cables and portals which linked the separate devices on pcs and laptops			2
one cable would talk to the keyboard , @entity19 recalls , while another would connect a modem			1
a different cable enabled printing , with another linking the hard drive to the monitor			2
" it was more difficult than it needed to be , " he says			0
" you were looking at two devices with connecting wires and you wanted things to happen but the rules were n't that simple			2
it was very difficult for the average person to use it			0
all the technology at that point was developed for technologists by technologists			0
" he set about creating a single connection for computers across the entire industry			2
for six years he lobbied colleagues at @entity34 and then at other computer firms , urging everyone to jump on the bus			1
" initially , it was difficult for them to understand the merits			0
we had a big tent and we included everybody , we listened to everybody 's input and tried to address them to the best of our abilities and that 's why usb is successful , " @entity19 said			1
it was all easier said than done , he says , requiring a radical change in the industry 's eco-system			1
" in order to be successful in anything like this you have to look at the problem from their perspective			0
so , if i went to , say , @entity107 -- which is now ( owned by ) @entity108 -- we used to think about their issues and what problems they faced , " he said			0
@entity95 was good because it addressed some of the customer satisfaction issues while also helping computer hardware manufacturers to save money			1
@entity19 's own commercial expectations for his invention were initially quite modest			1
" i thought this was a ( one off ) $ 40 million opportunity , " he says			2
" i could n't imagine where @entity95 has gone or where it will continue to go			1
this has exceeded the wildest of my imaginations			0
" the first model ( usb 1 ) arrived on the market in the late 1990s and was an instant hit			2
later versions -- @entity6 2.0 released 2000 and usb 3.0 which debuted in 2008 -- have vastly improved data transfer speeds			0
" @entity95 is 400 times faster ( than our original usb ) and as we go forward i see usb going to 816 times faster , " @entity19 says			1
the great part of usb is that the first device that you bought can still work with computers today , and hopefully it will work with computers in the future			1
" today , around two billion usb 's are shipped every year , with millions being sold every day			1
but the project has never been about the money , says the 56 - year - old			0
" somebody interviewed me once and they said , i do n't know , i do n't know , if i made a penny per usb point and @entity34 made a penny per usb point then we would have made a lot of money , " he says			1
" i think what we did was we created an open standard that everybody can benefit			1
what i am happy to see is that everybody participates in this eco-system and they are all making money			0
" the real bottom line for @entity19 though has been an enduring sense of worth in his own personal capital			2
" i think for any engineer to see your ideas , your visions on a shelf on a store is an incredible feeling -- you know , because you created something , you imagined something , " he says			0
" a lot of people told you that this could n't be done and then you go to the store or talk to users			0
they 'll all delighted by the usb , how easy it is			0
it makes you feel good			0

@entity34 's @entity19 *explains* how he created industry standard usb device
more than 10 billion usb devices are thought to be in circulation worldwide
@entity19 worked hard to *convince* *competitors* that @entity95 could benefit all parties *financially*
the *newest* editions of usb device are 400 times faster than original models
