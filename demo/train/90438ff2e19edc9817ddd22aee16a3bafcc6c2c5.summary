-- a man who allegedly tried to break into the home of a recently widowed @entity5 woman -- who shot and killed his alleged fellow intruder after calling 911 -- was freed thursday on bail despite a first - degree murder charge , a court clerk said			1
although he did not fire the fatal shot , 29 - year - old @entity9 is charged with first - degree felony murder in the incident because if someone dies during the commission of certain crimes , such as burglary , an alleged accomplice can be charged in the death , prosecutors have said			1
a hearing for @entity9 was held thursday in the central @entity21 of @entity22 , five days after the incident			1
during that hearing , @entity9 posted the $ 50,000 bond and was released , @entity25 court clerk @entity24 told @entity0			1

" it 's all dependent upon if the situation warrants it and the facts warrant it , " he said			0

and people have been convicted of first - degree murder under such circumstances , he added			1
@entity131 was the first of two 911 operators to speak with @entity33			1
the dispatcher told @entity61 's @entity135 on wednesday she learned in training that she could not tell a caller to shoot someone but , " as a mother , i wanted her to protect her baby			2
