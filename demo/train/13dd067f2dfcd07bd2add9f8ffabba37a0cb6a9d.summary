@entity0 -- global media tycoon @entity2 is " not a fit person " to run a major international company , @entity5 lawmakers investigating phone hacking at his tabloid @entity7 reported tuesday			1
the ruling could prompt @entity5 regulators to force him to sell his controlling stake in @entity12 , a significant part of his media empire			1
the damning report accused @entity2 and his son @entity16 of showing " willful blindness " to phone hacking at @entity7 , and said the newspaper " deliberately tried to thwart the police investigation " into the illegal activity			1
the paper 's publisher , @entity30 subsidiary @entity29 , " wished to buy silence in this affair and pay to make the problem go away , " the @entity23 's @entity22 found			1
@entity31 , the @entity5 media regulator that could force @entity2 out of @entity12 , said it was " reading with interest " the report from @entity23			1
the agency noted that it " has a duty under the @entity36 and 1996 to be satisfied that any person holding a broadcasting license is , and remains , fit and proper to do so			2
" @entity30 , which @entity2 leads as chairman and chief executive , accepted responsibility for some failings tuesday but pushed back against some of the more critical remarks made by lawmakers			1
" hard truths have emerged from the @entity48 : that there was serious wrongdoing at the @entity7 ; that our response to the wrongdoing was too slow and too defensive ; and that some of our employees misled the @entity48 in 2009 , " it said in a statement			2
however , remarks made by some lawmakers after the report was issued on tuesday were " unjustified and highly partisan , " it said			1
@entity30 said it had already acted on many of the failings highlighted in the report , had brought in new internal controls and is supporting police investigations into alleged wrongdoing			2
allegations of widespread illegal eavesdropping by @entity2 journalists in search of stories have shaken the media baron 's @entity30 empire and the @entity5 political establishment , up to and including prime minister @entity74			1
police have arrested dozens of people as part of investigations into phone hacking , e-mail hacking and police bribery , while two parliamentary committees and an independent inquiry led by lord justice @entity84 are probing the scandal			1
testifying last week before the @entity86 , @entity2 admitted that there had been a " cover - up " of phone hacking at @entity7 , which ceased publication last july			1
but @entity2 , who owns the @entity91 and the @entity92 in @entity0 , as well as controlling @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , said his @entity30 had been a victim of the cover - up , not the perpetrator			2
" someone took charge of a cover - up , which we were victim to and i regret , " he said thursday at the @entity86			2
he apologized for not having paid more attention to the scandal , which he called " a serious blot on my reputation			0
" tuesday 's report by the @entity22 is based , in part , on earlier testimony by @entity2 and @entity111			1
@entity112 , the chairman of the committee , said tuesday that , while there is " no definitive evidence to prove whether or not @entity111 was aware of ... evidence which indicated that phone hacking was widespread , the committee was nevertheless astonished that he did not seek to see the evidence			1
" @entity120 , the @entity121 lawmaker who has long been one of the fiercest critics of @entity2 , was blistering in a news conference announcing the parliamentary findings			1
" these people corrupted our country , " he said			0
" they have brought shame on our police force and our @entity23			0
they lied and cheated -- blackmailed and bullied and we should all be ashamed when we think how we cowered before them for so long			0
" but @entity132 , a @entity133 member of @entity23 who is on the committee with @entity135 and @entity120 , said the report had gone too far			2
she was one of the four conservative mps who dissented from the amendment to the report finding that @entity2 was not a fit person to run a company			1
she called the amendment " faintly ridiculous , " given @entity2 's decades in the business , and accused the @entity121 members of the committee of pushing through a " nakedly political " statement			2
" the amendments were so far out of left field they made a mockery of the whole thing , " she said			0
the section declaring @entity2 " not fit " passed by a vote of 6 to 4 , with support from @entity121 and @entity155 lawmakers , over opposition from conservatives			1
committee chairman @entity112 , a conservative , did not vote			0
the report did not accuse either @entity2 of misleading @entity23 , but said three of their underlings had done so in testimony to the committee			1
@entity165 right - hand man @entity164 was criticized , as were @entity166 , the last editor of @entity7 , and @entity168 , who was the paper 's lawyer for decades			0
@entity166 and @entity168 " gave repeated assurances that there was no evidence that any further @entity7 employee , beyond @entity174 , had been involved in phone - hacking , " the report says			1
" this was not true and , as further evidence disclosed to us by the newspaper 's solicitors @entity183 now shows , they would have known this was untrue when they made those statements			0
both @entity168 and @entity166 deliberately avoided disclosing crucial information to the @entity22 and , when asked to do , answered questions falsely			0
" @entity132 noted that @entity166 , the editor of the @entity190 , " has misled a select committee of @entity23			0
i would hope that a little bit of attention would be paid to the unanimous findings of the committee where named individuals misled @entity23			2
" in a statement , @entity166 said he stood by the evidence that he gave the committee			0
" the conclusions of the @entity22 have , perhaps inevitably , been affected by the fragmented picture which has emerged from the various witnesses over successive appearances and by the constraints within which the @entity22 had to conduct its procedure , " he said			0
" these issues remain the subject of a police investigation and the @entity84 judicial inquiry and i have every confidence that they will establish the truth in the fullness of time			0
" the full @entity215 will have to rule on whether the three committed contempt by misleading the committee , " and , if so , what punishment should be imposed , " the report says			2
" it is effectively lying to @entity23 , " @entity112 said			0
" @entity23 is the supreme court of the land			0
it is a very serious matter			0
" @entity12 shares were up slightly in @entity0 on the news			0
shares in @entity30 , which is traded in @entity226 , closed tuesday up 2.64 %			0
in a statement to @entity30 's 50,000 employees , @entity2 said the report " affords us a unique opportunity to reflect upon the mistakes we have made and further the course we have already completed to correct them			1
" he said that it was difficult for him to read many of its findings , " but we have done the most difficult part , which has been to take a long , hard and honest look at our past mistakes			2
" he continued , " we certainly should have acted more quickly and aggressively to uncover wrongdoing			0
we deeply regret what took place and have taken our share of responsibility for not rectifying the situation sooner			1
" he said @entity30 officials " have gone beyond what law enforcement authorities have asked of us , to ensure not only that we are in compliance with the law , but that we adhere to the highest ethical standards			0
" @entity2 said last week that if he had known the depth of the problem in 2007 , when a private investigator and a @entity2 journalist were sent to prison for phone hacking , he " would have torn the place apart and we would n't be here today			1
" but he also suggested last week that key parts of the scandal have been overblown			0
" the hacking scandal was not a great national thing until the @entity266 disclosure , half of which has been somewhat disowned by the police , " @entity2 said			1
he was referring to the revelation that people working for him had hacked into the voice mail of a missing 13 - year - old who later turned out to have been murdered			0
the @entity273 newspaper originally reported that the hackers had also deleted some of the voice mails left for the girl , leading to false hopes that she was still alive and deleting them herself			0
in fact , the messages may have expired automatically			0
@entity2 was also grilled over his media empire 's back - channel lobbying of the @entity5 government and said he learned of the existence of one of the key lobbyists only " a few months ago			1
" he said he was " surprised " by the extent of the contact by the employee , @entity293 , with the @entity5 government as it considered a bid by @entity30 to take full ownership of @entity12			2
that bid collapsed because of the phone - hacking scandal			2
the scandal has also forced @entity30 to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking			1
@entity2 and his son @entity16 have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them			1
they have always denied knowing about the scale of the practice , which police say could have affected thousands of people , ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans			0
@entity1 's @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 and @entity317 contributed to this report .			2
