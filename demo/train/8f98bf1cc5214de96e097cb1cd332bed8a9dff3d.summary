-- the @entity2 trial has made one thing crystal clear			1
when racial issues arise , we tend to unquestionably cheer for our own race like it 's a sporting match			1
there 's little regard for the arguments or feelings of those from another race			2
is the racial empathy gap in @entity15 growing ? it seems so			1
at least judging by the chatter of comments surrounding the trial			2
i heard repeatedly the statement from some @entity2 supporters -- including a radio show host on monday morning who is far from being a racist -- that " 94 % of black murder victims were killed by other blacks			1
" so instead of being empathetic to the @entity30 family -- whose son @entity31 was killed by @entity2 -- the words discounted the killing by essentially saying that black people kill each other so much so why should we care about this one black kid ? it does n't end there			1
there were speculations that there will be riots by the black community should @entity2 be found not guilty			2
as @entity0 's @entity45 rightly pointed out friday , these warnings basically label blacks as " barbarians " who " ca n't contain themselves			0
" on the other side , some people of color despicably threatened to harm or even kill @entity2 after he was acquitted			1
no matter what race you belong to , you have to admit this lack of concern for other races need to be addressed			2
sure , there were people protesting the @entity2 verdict other than blacks , but overall they were few and in between			1
( keep in mind that 75 % of @entity15 's population is white			0
) and when i say we lack racial empathy , i 'm not talking about feeling sorry for a race because of their " plight			1
" i mean true empathy -- " the ability to understand and share the feelings of another			0
" racial empathy means being able to honestly contemplate what it would be like to be a member of a different race			1
psychologists have noted that this type of empathy fosters conflict resolution			1
opening yourself to understanding why the other side believes what it does can help you find common ground			0
of course , this is not easy			0
it requires you to , at least temporarily , stop self - righteously dismissing competing arguments			0
you do n't have to agree with the opposing views , but you should listen and try to understand them			0
but when was the last time you heard leaders of community groups -- regardless of race -- say : " let 's look at from the other side ? " i have n't			0
a recent important study on racial empathy offers insights on the tangible consequences of our failure to identify with other races			1
researchers found that participants believed that black people felt less physical pain when subjected to the same injury as white people because blacks " have faced more hardship			0
" in other words , the study shows that people are quicker to dismiss the suffering of blacks than of whites because black people have historically suffered more challenges like " higher rates of diseases , disability and premature death			2
" the alarming conclusion is that this leads " to racial bias and potentially disastrous outcomes ( e.g. , condoning policy brutality against blacks , underestimating and undertreating black patients ' pain )			0
" there 's no simple fortune cookie piece of advice out there on how we can become more open and honest			0
but we can start simple			0
how can we increase our racial sympathy ? let 's look at issues from the vantage point of another race : why are they angry ? why are they afraid ? what would you feel like if you lived in a community where the crime you see is committed almost exclusively by one race ? conversely , how would you feel if you were repeatedly profiled by the police and society simply because of your skin color ? if we do n't get past the knee jerking defensiveness when discussing race , we will likely be burying more @entity153			1
let 's try to stop the tragedies before they happen			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			2

@entity158 : @entity2 trial shows that people see issues along racial lines
@entity158 : we need more racial empathy so that we can reduce tragedies and anger
he says psychology studies show that more empathy can foster conflict resolution
@entity158 : we can start by trying to see what it would be like to belong to a different race
