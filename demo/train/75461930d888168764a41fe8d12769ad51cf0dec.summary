in @entity45 , the coroner said tuesday that a 47 - year - old man found dead monday outside a home in @entity48 apparently died of hypothermia			0
the unusually early cold weather is the result of a blocking pattern over the @entity53 that is helping to allow freezing air from @entity55 to flow into the eastern half of the country , said @entity0 meteorologist @entity58			1

although the chilly temperatures left the @entity116 shivering , the upper @entity113 were bearing the brunt of the cold snap			1
overnight lows in parts of @entity121 and @entity122 dipped into negative territory tuesday morning , and they bottomed out in the teens across broad areas of the @entity126			2
" we had above - normal temperatures for much of the fall and i think this is the first really good winter outbreak of the year and people just are n't really used to it , " according to @entity132 of the @entity20 , who said there may be a silver lining to the early cold			1
