-- vice presidential debates are usually treated as bores or curios			0
the best you can hope for is a misstep that makes the headlines the next day -- think @entity7 comparing himself to @entity8 or @entity9 lambasting all those " @entity11 wars			0
" but the debaters are auditioning to be understudy , so they usually play it safe			0
record numbers tuned in to watch @entity16 vs. @entity17 in 2008 simply to see if @entity17 would go 90 minutes without humiliating herself or her running mate			1
apart from some aggressive winking , she performed adequately and disaster was avoided			0
so two personalities who ought to have made for great tv were actually a little dull			0
thursday night 's debate will be different , because it matters in a way that previous matchups have not			1
@entity27 's performance in last week 's debate seems to have shaken up the polls			1
that 's not just because he did well , but also because the voters appear to be more undecided about the election than we thought they were ( just look at the massive attitude shift that @entity35 reports among female voters )			2
in such an environment , gaffes and good rhetoric count for a great deal			0
recall that the debates proved just as important to deciding the @entity42 primaries , and one of the reasons why @entity27 won the primaries is that he was so good at the debates			0
with the country now evenly divided between the two nominees , the race could end up being settled by a few hours of televised sparring			2
hence , @entity16 vs. @entity51 is worth tuning in to			1
@entity52 : @entity16 must deliver for @entity53 it also helps that these two men embody the differences between the two parties			1
both are @entity59 , but from contrasting traditions			0
@entity16 comes from the @entity62 generation for whom @entity64 piety is centered on social justice and economic fairness			1
for him , government welfare programs are an extension of @entity71 charity -- and he 's happy to embrace the cultural changes that have altered attitudes about contraception , women and gay rights			2
7 questions you would ask at the vp debate by contrast , @entity51 is part of the @entity83 generation of conservative catholics who have often despaired of the @entity87 church 's flirtation with liberalism			1
@entity51 has a moral theology that sees government as sapping self - reliance , and abortion as the murder of the unborn			1
between the two of them , we have the bifurcation of the @entity59 personalized : social conscience vs. natural law			0
that said , it 's interesting to note that @entity51 has been prepping for this debate with @entity104 -- the man who provided legal assistance to pro-same - sex marriage campaigners			1
it 's surprising that no movement conservatives have made a fuss about the company that @entity51 keeps			1
in this contest between @entity59 , who stands the better chance of winning ? @entity51 , and for three reasons			1
first , @entity51 is younger			1
in last week 's debate , despite being the older man , @entity27 came across as more youthful and energetic than the president			1
he looked not only ready to lead , but also more willing			0
likewise , @entity51 is a handsome , athletic young man who hunts deer with a bow and arrow			2
already the star of an internet " @entity125 " meme , he will reinforce the impression that the @entity42 ticket is the more virile			0
@entity126 : how @entity51 sharpens debate skills second , @entity16 is a more erratic performer than @entity51 and so more likely to make a blunder			1
a good drinking game to play during the debate would be to take a shot every time @entity16 says " literally , " another if he mispronounces someone 's name , and another if he forgets @entity51 's			1
his tendency toward hyperbole and emotionally charged gaffes is notorious			0
the flip side of that problem is that if he keeps his natural energy too much in check , then he wo n't seem like the same old @entity16 that @entity141 know and love			2
in 2008 , he was outperformed by @entity17 partly because he seemed to be playing the statesman			0
as a rule , @entity16 does better in front of loud , sympathetic audiences ( see his barnstorming convention speech )			1
third , the issue momentum is with @entity27 / @entity51			2
it 's true that friday 's jobs report lowered the unemployment rate and brought some good news to the administration			0
but it does n't seem to be reflected in the polls yet			0
that might be because many @entity87 do n't feel like things are getting better -- because so many are quitting the labor market or getting part - time work			0
add to that some of the negative reports about the administration 's handling of the @entity165 and you get the sense that this week belongs to the @entity42			0
opinion : five ways @entity53 can bounce back whoever wins , what is reassuring for fans of politics is the importance that debate has played in this election			0
with millions of dollars spent on negative ads and the @entity179 awash with silly stories about dogs on cars and old speeches , it 's nice to know that uninterrupted , rational debate spread over just 90 minutes can still make such an impact in contemporary @entity87 democracy			2
@entity16 vs. @entity51 is far from @entity187 vs. @entity188 , but the spirit lives on			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

with the race close , thursday 's vp debate matters in a new way , says @entity192
@entity16 and @entity51 embody the differences between the two parties , @entity192 says
being younger and less erratic than @entity16 gives @entity51 an edge , he says
@entity192 : as a rule , @entity16 does better in front of loud , sympathetic audiences
