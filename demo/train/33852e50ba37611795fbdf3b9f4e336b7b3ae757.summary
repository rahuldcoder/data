-- when our helicopter flew into @entity4 , it almost felt like we were on some silent glide			1
the sharp sound of the rotor blades faded into background noise			1
@entity9 did not rise from the ground			1
there was not enough traffic or people or life to raise a ruckus			1
there were no fires burning or that dark energy that rises up from the ground when there is danger in the air			1
there was silence , people huddling in tents alongside flattened buildings , people sifting slowly through the rubble of their lives , people adrift			1
we entered @entity33 like a lot of the folks entering @entity33 , down right nervous			1
@entity33 has a history of horrible acts of violence against its own people and visitors			1
journalists have died in @entity33			1
there are many guns and many vendettas			1
it 's not just that there is an earthquake whose aftershocks could rattle away at what remains			1
there is an expectation of danger , a question in the air			1
will these desperate , disheartened , wounded people rise to violence and theft in the wake of this latest , largest disaster ? we landed without incident in the yard of the @entity65 @entity64 with precious supplies brought in by relief organizations			1
a @entity0 convoy laden with water and money and fuel followed us in by land without a hitch			1
and in the days that followed , we did not see a population breaking into buildings or fighting over scant resources			1
the @entity33 we saw is not a land of fires and violence and looting			1
this is a land where desperation has been supplanted by despair			1
each day , we left our workspace with security people , drivers , big guys that were supposed to help us navigate presumed dangers			2
they mostly hung out and chatted with kids playing around our cars			2
they walked us into a huge plaza where a massive tent city had formed			1
people just sitting there , holding their children beneath sheets so they are n't burned in the sun. some mothers are bathing their kids in murky water			2
there is one remedial medical station beneath a tent			1
three medical volunteers with meager supplies tend to the wounds of dozens			2
anguished mothers wait patiently with children wounded and wailing			2
one afternoon we happened upon @entity120 , a building that also housed a @entity122 and some local money order services			2
a flotilla of @entity126 folks from @entity127 and @entity128 and @entity129 descended with major artillery			2
a tank , a string of armored cars and high - ranking officials with bright stripes decorating their uniforms rushed around on high alert			1
they shut down the street as they entered the building and brought out sacks that seemed to be filled with money			2
full coverage when we went to take a picture , they became very agitated			2
some of them yelled that we had no business here and pushed us back into the road where the oncoming cars fortunately stopped in time			2
they were so overwhelming that a female official from @entity127 began to laugh at her colleagues			2
" let them take the photo , " she told a muscular @entity129 officer			2
" here , " he said handing her his walkie talkie			2
" you be in charge of this mission			2
" but the " mission " was barely picture worthy			0
the @entity33 ambled by , as the apparent sacks of money were removed for safe keeping			1
the scene was the same at the building where taxes are collected			0
a great crane lifted rubble while a crowd watched peacefully			0
no one seemed to be trying to get into the flattened presidential palace nearby even though there was not much visible security			0
we also passed gas lines			0
gas is the key to so many things right now , powering the car that can get you out of this disaster , running the generator that can turn on your lights or make it possible to call for help on a cell phone			0
the cars sit quietly , drivers holding their places without a quarrel			0
we drove around day after day and saw nothing but sad people sweeping their streets of rubble and bodies and wreckage			0
we drove out to @entity202 , the epicenter of the quake , and people calmly moved bananas , sugar cane and water from the fields into tent cities erected in open space			1
@entity33 's missing , found we saw an organized crowd being handed water bottles from soldiers who flew in from @entity216			1
we did not see one gun , except the ones carried by security guards , police officers and soldiers			0
in @entity223 , two hours south , a group of young @entity33 ran around with expensive video cameras documenting the destruction of their hometown , @entity33 's cultural capital			1
they had water flown in by their sponsors as well as food and generators , but no one tried to steal them			0
the hotels that survived were unguarded but not a soul ventured in to take the furniture or bedding that might have made life in the tent cities more bearable			1
@entity33 doctors staffed the " hospital , " a patch of grass outside the real hospital that fell down			1
@entity248 doctors helped them with their work , rationing antibiotics and painkillers			0
people were in great pain , but no one screamed for help or painkillers			0
they seemed to think that they were getting whatever was available			0
the @entity129 posted guards at one gate to keep folks from getting to the piers where they brought in supplies , but no one was trying to get in anywhere around this huge dock			0
they stood in line at distribution centers , grabbed a broom or shovel to help the soldiers clear streets			0
when the @entity128 erected a mobile medical unit , the people formed a peaceful line and repeatedly expressed their gratitude			0
these are people with injuries that make you gasp			0
many amputations have been done by amateurs in bad circumstances			0
no one said a word			0
we followed the directors of an orphanage as they traveled through some of @entity4 's poorest neighborhoods			0
they did n't have many supplies , but they wanted to share			0
no one tried to rob us			0
a woman broke down in tears begging us to help us find her son			0
she ignored our bottles of water and food			0
she just wanted her son			0
impact your world a few nights later , her orphanage was hit by bandits who did n't take anything , but scared the kids			0
at another orphanage we visited , bandits struck twice but left both times with nothing			1
the orphanage director said they left it because they did n't want to steal supplies from children			0
my colleagues saw a few folks break into places and even captured a few scuffles on tape			0
but those who have spent a lot of time in @entity33 was certain there was no more crime , possibly even less crime , than would visit this city of millions on a regular day			1
the story of @entity33 , at this time , is not one of unending violence , looting and a population angry enough to fight over scant resources			1
but the people we met were wounded and weary and afraid to go back inside			0
the earth could shake at any moment and death could visit once again .			0

despite desperate times , many @entity33 not turning to violence
tent cities , *makeshift* hospitals are new way of life in quake - ravaged country
many residents orderly , *appreciative* in wake of chaos
