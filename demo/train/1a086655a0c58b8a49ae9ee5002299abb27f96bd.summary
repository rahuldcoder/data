they estimated at least 400 men and women , in addition to as many as 100 children , were on board			1
two survivors interviewed by the @entity0 and @entity22 police in @entity23 said the traffickers became enraged after the migrants -- who had already switched to small boats three times during their four days at sea -- refused to move to a smaller vessel			1
the migrants said they 'd rather go back to @entity13 than continue on in an even smaller vessel that they believed was not seaworthy			2
the @entity7 ' account was corroborated by several other survivors who were interviewed on the @entity35 island of @entity36 , the @entity0 said			1
they said the smugglers , who they said were @entity7 and @entity13 , had begun yelling and throwing sticks at the migrants after they refused to leave the boat before then ramming the vessel			1
some migrants managed to jump into the smaller boat , while one passenger " killed himself in despair by hanging , " a survivor said			2
" after they hit our boat , they waited to make sure that it had sunk completely before leaving			2
they were laughing , " he added			0

" their actions are as callous as they are evil			0
" @entity22 navy finds dozens of bodies in migrant boat ' shocking and unacceptable ' according to the @entity0 , the latest reported sinking would take the death toll off @entity111 's shores this year to nearly 3,000			1
