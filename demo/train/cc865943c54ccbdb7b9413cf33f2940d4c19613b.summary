-- @entity1 is emerging from the grip of its strongest @entity4 weather pattern on record -- a meteorological event that brings either devastating floods or , in the case of its counterpart @entity11 , scorching droughts			1
according to the @entity13 , the weather pattern that brought dramatic floods to southern @entity16 a year ago -- one of the most intense on record -- is waning , but oceans around the eastern seaboard are still warm enough to cause high pressure systems that dump months of rainfall in a matter of a few days			2
" there was a very slow moving trough over inland @entity1 that stretched from the far northwest , through the @entity29 and on to the southeast including @entity31 and @entity32 , " said @entity24 , acting senior meteorologist at the @entity26			2
" when it meets all that nice warm moisture from the @entity36 and @entity37 , we got several days of heavy rainfall that led to flooding , " she said			2
" this type of broad scale pattern is more conducive to rainfall but it 's also exacerbated by short - term meteorological patterns too			1
" scientists are blaming @entity4 for the recent flooding in @entity1 and the @entity45			1
the weather pattern is part of a natural cycle called the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) and occurs when cold water builds up on the west coast of the @entity52 continent			0
pulled by strong easterly winds , the cold water surges west across the @entity54 , creating a " cold tongue " that pushes warm water and a consequent high pressure system ahead of it			0
the resulting weather system -- filled with warm , water - laden air -- dumps unusually heavy rain when it makes landfall			1
its opposite effect , @entity11 , is usually marked by wetter weather over @entity52			0
currently , @entity67 is in the grip of drought			0
@entity4 occurs at intervals between a few years and a decade and generally lasts for a year or two			0
to what extent global warming has contributed to the intensity of the weather pattern is still not known , with records of the event only stretching back 60 years			0
nevertheless , the bureau has said the pattern is similar in intensity to @entity4 flooding in 1939 and 1950			0
long - term weather patterns across the @entity1 are notoriously difficult to forecast and meteorologists are collecting oral evidence from @entity85 people to get a handle on the continent 's weather cycles			1
the @entity13 's @entity90 project aims to build a weather map of @entity1 based on knowledge of weather patterns from indigenous communities			1
under this system , a startlingly complex mosaic of weather patterns is being mapped			1
for example , studies have established that the @entity85 people of the @entity102 region recognized six distinct seasons , rather than the four given to the area by its white settlers .			0

@entity1 emerging from strongest @entity4 on record
@entity4 is associated with strong wet weather patterns in @entity1
the weather patterns create warm seas that lead to heavy rains
scientists have been compiling data from @entity118 to get a grip on long - term patterns
