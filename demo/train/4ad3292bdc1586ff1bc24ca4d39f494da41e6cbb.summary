it created quite a stir			0
photos soon appeared on social media , with memes not far behind			0
a parody @entity20 account quickly gained thousands of followers			0

she had reportedly obtained the @entity29 snow macaque , named @entity30 , illegally when he was just over a month old			1
videos on her @entity33 channel provided glimpses of the next seven months , in which she described how often he ate and how much attention he required			0
but after @entity30 's public escape and appearance , she was fined and forced to hand @entity30 over to animal services			1

@entity26 vowed to get @entity30 back and filed a lawsuit against the sanctuary			1
on friday , a judge ruled against @entity26			0
