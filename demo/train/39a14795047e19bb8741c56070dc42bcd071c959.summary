-- there is nothing wrong with professional athletes expressing their opinions about social or political issues			2
just because you slip on a helmet or swing a racquet does n't mean you do n't have the right to voice an opinion on politics , the economy , faith or any other issue in @entity15			2
however , @entity17 's recent comments about the @entity19 grand jury decision and the subsequent unrest across the nation are n't just off - the - cuff comments from an athlete waxing political during an interview			1
for the last several years @entity17 has fashioned himself as some type of hard - truth - telling cultural critic -- especially on issues of race in @entity15			1
what his @entity19 commentary makes obvious is that he 's just an uninformed rich guy who is given way more credibility than he deserves when discussing racial and political issues in @entity15			1
in an interview on a @entity37 sports radio station , the conversation meandered from sports to politics as @entity17 began to express his frustration with looters and violence in the wake of the @entity19 grand jury decision to not indict officer @entity45 for the death of @entity47			1
@entity17 's comments that those people damaging businesses and attacking police are " scumbags " is pretty boilerplate stuff that most @entity54 , including peaceful protesters , would agree with , even if different words were used			1
it was when @entity17 began his riffs on race that things went out of bounds			1
" the true story came out from the grand jury testimony , " @entity17 said , citing that " three or four witnesses , who were black , said exactly what the cop said			1
" in reference to @entity69 's death at the hands of @entity72 police he went even further			1
" when the cops are trying to arrest you , if you fight back , things go wrong			0
i do n't think they were trying to kill mr. @entity69			2
he was a big man and they tried to get him down			0
" and then he followed up with generalized comments that there are lots of black criminals out there and that essentially black people are the cause of most of their problems with white police			2
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity17 said , " we as black people , we have a lot of crooks			1
we ca n't just wait until something like ( the @entity47 shooting ) happens			0
we have to look at ourselves in the mirror			0
" " there is a reason that they racially profile us in the way they do			0
sometimes it is wrong , and sometimes it is right , " @entity17 said			2
the problem with these statements is n't just that they are misleading -- 16 out of 29 witness statements said that @entity106 had his hands up to surrender , in direct conflict with @entity45 's story ; and police used a banned choke hold on @entity69 , a measure that was known to cause death -- but that @entity17 is uniquely and astoundingly unqualified to discuss issues of race , law and police violence			1
if property damage makes you a scumbag , then how would we describe someone who , in the 1990s , got into bar fights , throwing a man face first through a store window ? ( @entity17 , who said he was provoked , was fined and sentenced to community service in that incident			1
) if black folks need to take more responsibility how would you describe a black man who drives drunk , runs a red light and explains to police that he was rushing home to have sex with the woman in the passenger seat ? if those actions make you a scumbag , or show lack of responsibility , then @entity17 should let it be known he 's talking about himself			1
because he has been charged with crimes over the course of his career but somehow he never ended up shot , or dead , and has spent three days in jail			0
@entity17 's personal failings do n't disqualify him from social commentary , but his hypocrisy does			1
@entity17 is a very , very rich man , whose fame and celebrity have protected him from the kind of hostility and harassment from the police that thousands of other @entity54 , especially @entity54 , experience every day			2
it 's easy for @entity17 to lecture protesters and looters and mourning families about how to deal with anger			2
but most @entity54 ca n't defuse a " tense " police situation with the aid of celebrity			0
nevertheless , @entity17 's hypocrisy about his own privilege and lack of real knowledge about @entity19 would n't be so bad if media outlets did n't keep giving him major opportunities to express his views			1
this preposterous phenomenon is captured perfectly by his " @entity176 " co-host @entity174 in an open letter to @entity17 released on wednesday			2
" however , what i consistently find interesting is how writers and media members view your insights in politics , and now race relations , with the same reverence as your insights in sports			0
" it 's not that you should n't ever have an opinion , but you are often quoted alongside the likes of @entity190 and even president @entity191			0
i would hope that @entity190 or president @entity191 would never be referenced with you when picking the next @entity193 ! " the body of work that our @entity197 leaders put in by planning , executing and activating does not justify you being in the conversation			0
" in other words , @entity17 gets a huge forum to talk about cases like @entity19 and the killing of @entity206 because he 's black and famous , not because he 's informed , or credible or even representative of any segment of the population			1
and while that might make for entertaining television , it certainly does n't amount to social criticism anyone should take seriously			0
whether it was @entity217 on rape , or @entity219 on @entity220 , or @entity221 on @entity191 , athletes say offensive or dumb things about politics and culture all the time , but analysts and journalists always give them a soft landing			0
this is usually done by pointing out that said athlete is a @entity232 , or was great in some playoff series or donates to charity			0
@entity17 does n't deserve that soft landing anymore			2
if networks are going to lob him easy questions about larger social issues , he should have to defend what he says just like any other guest			0
but if his comments over the last few years are any indicator , he probably ca n't			0
in other words , if sir @entity17 wants to post up in the world of politics about @entity19 , then he needs to get more informed , more prepared and more connected to what he 's talking about			1
there 's no room for him in the court of public opinion when lives , property and the health of our democracy are at stake			0
join us on @entity257 / @entity256 .			0

@entity17 weighed in on @entity19 , @entity69 , racial profiling
@entity261 : @entity17 is entitled to his opinions , but hypocrisy is evident
he says @entity17 is insulated from what most black men face
