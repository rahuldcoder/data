here 's a roundup of five medical studies published this week that might give you new insights into your health , mind and body			0
remember , correlation is not causation -- so if a study finds a connection between two things , it does n't mean that one causes the other			2
more babies are being breast - @entity16 for @entity17 and @entity18 breast - feeding rates in the @entity20 are on the rise , according to the latest @entity22 from the @entity23			1
the @entity23 reported that 79 % of babies born in 2011 were breast - fed. @entity26 states lagged behind the national average , with @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 exhibiting breast - feeding rates below 65 %			1
@entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 led the nation with breast - feeding rates above 90 %			1
the @entity39 recommends that breast - feeding continue for at least 12 months , but only about 50 % of infants were still breast - feeding at 6 months			1
that number dwindled to just above 25 % for infants at 12 months			2
extreme weather kills thousands in @entity20 each @entity45 and @entity18 about 2,000 people in the @entity20 die from extreme weather conditions each year , according to a report released wednesday by the @entity23			1
the report analyzed death certificates from 2006 to 2010 for deaths attributed to weather - related causes , such as heatstrokes , hypothermia , floods , storms and lightning			1
roughly one - third of the weather - related deaths were attributed to excessive natural heat , and nearly two - thirds were attributed to excessive natural cold			2
the @entity23 also found that males , african - americans and the elderly had the highest weather - related mortality rates of any other demographics			1
women in the military are less likely to @entity69 although male military enlistees and veterans have a history of increased alcohol consumption , it turns out the opposite may be true for women			0
a study published thursday in @entity78 found that women in the military are less likely to drink alcohol than women who have n't served			0
researchers used data taken from a 1997 survey of almost 9,000 people and followed up with the young men and women each year until 2010			0
the study 's authors suggest the threat of sexual harassment and assault may be a possible explanation for enlisted women not imbibing			0
they also speculate that women in the military abstain from alcohol to avoid being looked down upon by fellow soldiers			0
blood sugar linked to how brains respond to @entity101 for the @entity102 does your mouth water at the sight of foods such as pizza and @entity109 fries ? genetics are n't all to blame			0
your brain 's response to the sight of food actually has more to do with your blood sugar levels , according to research presented tuesday at the @entity118 's annual conference			0
researchers at the @entity120 examined 21 pairs of identical twins to see whether the brain 's response to the sight of food was linked to genetics			0
the scientists found twins with lower blood glucose levels saw greater activation in the brain in response to pictures of food			0
but when it came to rating their appetites and choosing portions for meals , the twins reacted similarly			0
autistic brains seen as less flexible at switching @entity140 when switching from one task to another , the brains of autistic children show little change in connectivity , according to a study published tuesday			1
researchers at @entity149 compared functional mri images of the brains of 34 autistic children to those of 34 typically developing children during different types of activities			2
in the experiment , the study authors examined the children 's brains at rest , while they looked at pictures and while they were solving math problems			1
the authors found that it was much easier to distinguish how brain connectivity changed between tasks in children who were not autistic			1
in the brains of children who were autistic , researchers saw little change .			2

@entity23 says that 79 % of @entity20 babies born in 2011 were breast - fed
extreme weather kills 2,000 @entity20 each year , @entity23 report says
when switching tasks , brains of children with autism show less connectivity , study says
