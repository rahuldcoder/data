editor 's note : @entity2 is associate professor of @entity3 and political science at @entity5 and the director of the @entity7			1
his published work includes a book , " @entity16 in @entity17 , " which received the @entity10 for the best book by the @entity12 of black political scientists and the @entity14 from the @entity15			0
@entity2 says practitioners of blackface always try to justify it , but the defenses do n't ring true			1
( @entity22 ) -- @entity23 almost got it right when he challenged the doctors who mocked the @entity26 in blackface on an @entity28 version of " the @entity29			1
" the fact is , even @entity28 know better			1
it is n't that they did not know that what they were doing was shocking and offensive ; they just thought they could get away with it			0
" if they turned up looking like that in the @entity46 , " he said on the " @entity41 " television show , " hey , hey , there 's no more show			1
" in a message posted on his web site , @entity23 wrote that " in the @entity46 culture , the blackface image is steeped in a negative history and considered offensive			1
" he also wrote , " i do not believe that the performers intended any harm			0
" let 's put this in context			0
@entity28 have their own ugly history of racism against @entity59			1
one in which half - white , half - @entity61 children were forcibly taken from their mothers and raised in group homes so they could learn to properly integrate into white society			0
there is no cultural context in which blackface minstrelsy is okay or acceptable			1
blackface is one of the most pernicious and painful stereotypes about people of @entity74 descent			1
blackface has appeared everywhere from @entity76 to @entity77 , and it is always ugly , despite what those who put it on claim			2
the doctors who did the @entity84 " tribute " claimed that they were honoring @entity84			0
they were mocking him , and that is what blackface has always been			2
the same applies for those like a responder on the @entity90 web site who suggests that blackface models presented in @entity95 @entity94 magazine are simply cultural play : " the @entity46 cultural imperialists of the @entity98 are out in force again			1
" it is neither imperialist or wrong to point out racist imagery , even if done in good fun			0
in a cruel twist , the commenter takes the victims of racism and imperialism and calls them the perpetrators			0
but both the photographers and @entity94 are aware of the problems of racism in @entity113 and the barriers black women face in the fashion industry			0
like old blackface minstrelsy , when you ca n't find blacks you think are worthy to play the part , you simply blacken up white actors or , in this case , models			2
the message : real black people are n't good enough at being themselves			2
whether it is the original white " @entity127 " or white fraternity / sorority girls and boys , blackface is always about mocking black skin and presenting stereotypical black behavior			2
minstrels always clown around , sing and dance and otherwise dehumanize the individuals they represent			0
the blackface itself by whites reduces them to one critical feature : their black skin			2
and in almost every case , even this one , it 's exaggerated			0
none of the @entity26 are that dark ; it is a rank racial caricature			2
even in the early days of blackface minstrelsy , those who practiced it did not see themselves as promoting pernicious racial stereotypes and hatred but , like the doctors on the @entity28 show , honoring fun aspects of african - american culture and being			1
no one then or now who uses blackface cops to saying , " i intend to dehumanize black people			1
" everyone has an excuse or an alternative explanation of what it means			0
from the frat boys to the @entity168 @entity167 fans mocking black driver @entity169 to the soccer fans who throw bananas on a soccer field in @entity113 just for fun , they all make attempts to excuse the behavior by saying they 're personally not racist and they never meant to hurt anyone			0
the most common response is , they do n't understand the reaction			0
blackface is always designed as comedy , to shock , to mock and to get a few laughs			2
for a @entity84 tribute , one can see the prisoners from a jail in the @entity189 dancing to @entity84 's " @entity190			0
" their moving homage did n't need blackface			2
@entity84 's music and dancing were what moved , motivated and captivated them , not his skin color and hair texture			2
so whether it 's racist caricatures on @entity76 stamps or @entity28 doctors , the signs and symbols of demeaning black people are universal			1
they transcend continents , cultures and genres			0
at the same time , so are the denials			0
the people who traffic in them always have the same set of denials			2
they did in late 19th - century and early 20th - century @entity46 , and they do now in @entity28 , @entity76 or @entity168			1
they do it because they want to honor black people , they want to take in black culture and expression , and they ca n't do so without putting on blackface			1
they also all know it is offensive but think it is n't so offensive that they ca n't get away with it			0
they just ca n't resist race and blackness as the vehicle for comedy			0
research shows that whites in countries like @entity17 , @entity234 , @entity95 and many others often express higher levels of racism against blacks in surveys and experiments that tap unconscious attitudes than in the @entity46			1
the rancor that has surrounded race in the @entity46 -- while not creating a post-racial @entity46 -- has at least moved the dial substantially in terms of racial attitudes among whites and made a substantial portion of them more sensitive to the issue			1
though many other countries look down upon the @entity46 racial past , they often do so at the expense of asking hard questions about their racial present			1
the @entity46 is certainly not perfect , but we also have elected a black president and come a long way toward making anti-racism a norm			1
such that a white @entity262 musician recognizes an ugly racial caricature when he sees one			0
@entity23 , as a son of the @entity262 , you were both calling it right but also being polite			1
i applaud you for calling it as it is , but you gave them too much credit for ignorance			1
they knew they were offending ; they just thought , like many others , they could get away with it			0
fortunately , they did n't			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity23 was right to *condemn* @entity28 use of blackface
he says blackface is always demeaning to people of color
he says racial attitudes in @entity46 are more *progressive* than in some nations
@entity2 : @entity23 gave @entity28 too much credit for ignorance of the offense
