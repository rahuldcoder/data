-- the deadly church and mosque attacks in @entity3 and @entity4 , and the deaths of @entity7 and @entity8 leaders dominated @entity10 headlines in 2012			1

in another milestone , @entity44 's @entity43 was inaugurated as the chief of the @entity47			2
the former minister took the reins of a male - dominated organization facing funding woes and challenged it to reduce its reliance on aid			2
her election could ease tensions between the body and the @entity59 , which also picked an @entity28 woman as its top prosecutor			1
critics have accused the court of focusing on @entity28 nations and overlooking opportunities to investigate abuses in other countries			1
@entity69 lawyer @entity68 took over as the court 's top prosecutor , a move welcomed by critics as a major step in healing relations between the two organizations			2
the three were the first women to assume their respective positions			2
growing economies , middle class @entity10 is home to some of the fastest - growing economies in the world			1
and the thriving , burgeoning middle class is one indication of that			1
the number of middle - class africans tripled over the past three decades to 313 million , or about 34 % of the continent 's population , the @entity87 says in its latest report			1
the figure is a marked improvement from previous years			0
middle - class earners are described as people spending between $ 2 and $ 20 a day , a threshold criticized by some analysts as too low			1
the report says that the overall number of people defined as middle class includes a " floating class " -- those with expenditure levels of $ 2 to $ 4 per day , a group considered at risk of sliding back to poverty levels			1
though the report also warns of the growing number of income inequality , it also notes that the middle class is crucial in anchoring @entity28 economies			1
" it 's a call to say ' look , please invest in @entity10 , there are good returns , ' " says @entity114 , chief economist and vice president of the @entity87			2

@entity128 members picked a political newcomer as president , who then named another political novice as prime minister			0
@entity124 also adopted a provisional constitution and selected parliament members -- all in recent months			1
the new leadership marks a milestone for the nation , which plunged into chaos after dictator @entity140 was overthrown 21 years ago			2
clan warlords and militants battled for control after his ouster , sparking a civil war and mayhem			0
in another recent achievement , @entity124 and @entity47 troops forced out @entity151 militants from @entity152 , sending residents frolicking to the beach as life in the capital trickled back to normalcy			2

coalition forces forced them out of that city as well			0
it was the last major town under militant control			0
@entity7 elections @entity7 lived up to its " mature democracy " reputation again this year , a political feat that has eluded most nations in @entity10			1
long hailed as a beacon of democracy and progress in the continent , the nation re-elected the incumbent , who beat his closest contender with a razor - thin margin			0
despite the narrowness of the victory , no violence erupted , unlike elections in nations such as the @entity185 , where both the incumbent and the winner clung to power after the results of the 2010 poll			0
a series of other @entity28 nations have also descended into violence after elections , making @entity7 a noteworthy exception			1
while there was some bickering from the losing sides , the nation maintained peace for the most part			0
president @entity202 served as vice president under his predecessor , who died this year			0
in another move highlighting the solidity of its democracy , @entity7 immediately swore in @entity208 to avoid a power vacuum			2
@entity211 's emotional win @entity211 won its first @entity212 -- nearly two decades after a plane crash killed its team , coaches and crew members			1

in the end , @entity211 hoisted the @entity212 after beating @entity185 8 - 7 in a dramatic penalty shootout			1
