@entity1 it all started eight years ago tuesday , near the spot where @entity4 once warned that @entity6 's divides could tear it apart			1
in @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity7 flashed a smile , bounded on stage in a long dark coat , and vowed , like his political hero , to " transform a nation " and unleash a wave of hope and change			1
he looked as fresh as the frigid air in which thousands had gathered , wrapped up in scarves and winter coats , to witness the launch of a campaign that , improbably , would end in the @entity23			2
eight years later , the end of @entity7 's grueling , crisis - addled administration is in sight and his supporters have learned by experience how much harder it is to be president than to run for the office			1
dreams of a new bipartisan era have given way to constant confrontations with a @entity36 that is now completely controlled by @entity37 , many of whom are on a mission to dismantle much of @entity7 's agenda			1
the situation is n't much better on the global front , where @entity7 continues to grapple with all - too - familiar foreign policy challenges in @entity45 and @entity46 along with new threats from @entity48			1
from tuesday , @entity7 's time left in the @entity23 will be shorter than the time it took him to win the presidency , and his 2007 speech has become a cautionary tale of the gulf between powerful campaign rhetoric and reality			1
it also remains a guidepost to the political philosophy that has underpinned the @entity7 administration and a reference point for both backers and critics as they write history 's first draft on his presidency			1
on that saturday morning in 2007 , from behind a podium bearing his new campaign logo , a rising sun symbolizing new hope , @entity7 -- with not a gray hair in his head -- rattled off a list of how he would change the nation			1
he pledged to deliver universal health care within four years , help families struggling from " paycheck to paycheck , " seek to end poverty in @entity6 , close out a " war with no end " and make future generations proud by defusing the threat from global warming			2
in hindsight , his sights were trained too high			2
while even his critics would admit @entity7 wrought significant political change , he has often fallen short of his rarefied goals , running up against a system of governance set up by @entity6 's founders to resist sharp change of political direction			1
indeed , millions more people do have health insurance thanks to @entity101			0
@entity103 coverage , however , remains a dream			0
many @entity6 still live paycheck to paycheck			0
the economic crisis , yet to erupt when @entity7 gave his speech , meanwhile required the president to spend much of the political capital he won with his 2008 triumph on a financial overhaul that 's now under attack by congressional @entity37			1
tackling poverty is now the rallying call in yet another presidential campaign			1
eyeing 2016 , republicans are suddenly joining the crusade			0
@entity36 , meanwhile , refused the tough economic pill that putting a cap on carbon emissions would entail			0
@entity6 's alliances may be in better shape than in the go - it - alone days of @entity125 's first term			0
but trans - @entity127 tensions are obvious over issues like @entity129			0
for sure , @entity7 honored his vow to get troops home from @entity45 and @entity46			1
but the battle against @entity134 extremism grinds on over a widened battlefield			0
and ironically , @entity7 became the president who ordered @entity6 back to @entity45 , to confront a new enemy , @entity138			1
declaring wars over is one thing , truly ending them is another			0
in @entity8 , @entity7 warned the @entity6 must leave @entity45 because " it 's time to admit that no amount of @entity6 lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else 's civil war			1
" that mantra has guided his foreign policy in office -- and explains his reluctance to throw @entity6 forces into the cauldron of @entity155			0
such chaos has not been kind to @entity7 's 2007 vow that it was time to " usher in a new birth of freedom on this @entity161			1
" for example , he spent monday wrestling with global crises including a challenge from @entity48 , which increasingly operates in @entity167 - era terms , and @entity168 , which is driving a hard bargain in nuclear talks			0
implicit in @entity7 's appeal eight years ago was his assurance that @entity1 politics did not have to be so bitter or so divided			1
with the certainty of a yet untested politician , he cited the example of @entity4 's " @entity180 " speech and subsequent presidency to argue political change was possible			1
" the life of a tall , gangly , self - made @entity8 lawyer tells us that a different future is possible , " @entity7 said			1
" he tells us that there is power in words			0
he tells us that there is power in conviction , that beneath all the differences of race and region , faith and station , we are one people			0
" eight years on , that sentiment , and @entity7 's promise that few obstacles can " withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change " bears re-examination			1
it was not the " power of words " that enacted health care reform , but now - defunct @entity209 majorities in @entity36			0
change in the @entity7 era has sometimes been incremental			2
it 's now enacted only by wielding executive powers , which @entity37 say are an abuse of the president 's authority			0
the " power of words " -- put to the test by @entity7 's @entity226 address to the @entity134 world in 2009 -- also failed to shift geopolitical logic overseas , as turmoil shatters the @entity219 , and @entity6 foes sense weakness			2
back home , @entity1 is more divided and poisoned politically than ever			0
republicans may have rejected compromise , but @entity7 's critics say his own partisan reflex is also to blame			2
he could not , for instance , resist reminding the @entity37 during his @entity234 in january that he beat them twice			0
and his negative re-election campaign to beat @entity236 in 2012 ran counter to his own rejection of " petty and trivial " politics in 2007			0
but the president , his hair now speckled with white , insists he was not naive			2
in the @entity234 , as much an argument to future historians as a policy wish list , @entity7 offered his own rebuttal to his critics			2
he reprised the @entity247 speech , which paved the way for his 2007 announcement , in which he declared there " was n't a liberal @entity6 , or a conservative @entity6 ; a black @entity6 or a white @entity6 , but a @entity6			0
" " over the past six years , the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency has not delivered on this vision , " he said			2
" but i still think the cynics are wrong			0
