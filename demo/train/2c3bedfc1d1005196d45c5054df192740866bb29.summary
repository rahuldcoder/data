-- the long - running battle between a @entity3 community and its critics over a new mosque took a dramatic turn with a county judge 's ruling that could bring construction to a halt			1
" everyone is really shocked , many people are crying about this , " @entity11 , leader of the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , said wednesday			0
" we did exactly what other churches in the county did , " he said			0
" we followed the same process that other churches did			0
why did this happen ? some people feel like it is discrimination			0
" chancellor @entity24 ruled tuesday that plans for the new mosque , previously approved by a planning commission , are now " void and of no effect			1
" opinion : @entity30 , how can @entity3 - @entity30 reach non-muslims ? he said the planning commission violated state law by not providing proper public notice			1
the ruling throws the date of the mosque 's completion , scheduled for july , up in the air			1
@entity42 attorney @entity41 said @entity24 did not address the issue of whether work on the mosque has to stop right away			1
county planners will discuss options and determine an appropriate course of action , he said			0
@entity50 : opposing mosque construction is not discrimination @entity11 said construction will go on until the @entity54 receives orders to stop			1
" the ruling was a bit foggy , " he said			1
" we will do what 's right			1
" @entity60 , a critic of the decision to approve the mosque , said @entity24 's opinion was correct " because there was no due process			1
" she told @entity0 's " @entity68 " on wednesday evening that the public knew nothing until " it was a done deal			1
" " it 's not a matter of @entity71 with me , " @entity60 said			1
" the county government is supposed to operate in a particular way ... people who live in an area where a mosque or anything else is going to be built are supposed to have a right to say something about it			1
" in his opinion , @entity24 said he would allow attorneys for those who filed suit over the mosque approval process to prepare an order for his review			1
attorney @entity87 lodged such an order wednesday			1
it will be held five business days , after which the judge can review and sign it			0
the order says the may 2010 decision by planning commissioners to approve the center 's plans failed to meet public notice requirements			1
it decrees " a permanent injunction is entered against defendant county officials from taking any further actions or permitting any third party from taking any further actions inconsistent with this order			0
" @entity24 did not order an immediate stop to construction , @entity41 argued			1
" an order is not final for 30 days , " the county attorney said			2
we ca n't go out there ( and stop construction ) and then be sued by the @entity12			1
they can file suit against us			0
" the judge 's opinion , according to @entity41 , also could be appealed			2
" we 're very much premature in telling someone to stop something			2
" @entity24 , in a statement wednesday , said he could not comment and the case was still pending , without a final order			0
@entity87 told " @entity68 " that construction should stop because of the ruling			1
during the trial , attorneys for the mosque 's opposition argued that the county failed to alert the public about meetings before the mosque was approved , @entity0 affiliate @entity125 reported			1
@entity42 attorneys said that the meetings were announced in the local free newspaper and on its website and that the notices clearly complied with @entity3 law			0
the judge , however , said the announcements in a local paper were " in relatively small type near the bottom of a page which contained a number of advertisements and legal notices , most of which were provided by the city of @entity152			0
" @entity24 said his decision does not preclude the county from " again considering the same issues at a subsequent hearing when proper notice is given			0
" the @entity54 has 30 days to appeal the ruling and plans to apply again for a permit , spokesman @entity158 said			1
" hopefully , this time , the county will make it right , " he said			0
" we followed the process according to the law			0
there is no question about it			0
we are singled out just because of our faith			1
" the @entity170 called on the @entity171 to ensure the religious rights of @entity173 in @entity174			0
" @entity179 constitutional rights should not be diminished merely because @entity181 bigots are able to manufacture a controversy about what would otherwise be normal religious activities , " said @entity175 , staff attorney for the organization , which advocates for @entity3 civil liberties			2
" the judge 's ruling is apparently based on a fictitious ' heightened standard ' for public notice when muslims are involved , " he said			1
the mosque expansion gained national attention , including a @entity0 documentary , because in some ways , it was similar to the proposal to build an @entity12 center two blocks from the site of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks in @entity199			2
the @entity12 has existed for more than a decade , but the fight erupted when planning commissioners approved the 52,960 - square - foot building on @entity203			2
the backlash was stinging and included intimidation , lawsuits and an august 2010 fire that destroyed construction equipment and damaged vehicles at the construction site for the mosque			1
police said it was arson			0
a sign announcing the mosque was spray - painted with the words " not welcome			2
" for months , mosque leaders searched for contractors willing and able to do the job			2
because of the opposition and threats the project has provoked , the construction job became more complicated			2
the work now requires more layers of security , including cameras			0
my take : this just in , @entity174 court says @entity232 is a religion some contractors were n't willing to take the job			0
mosque leaders said contractors told them it had become too much of a hot - button issue and presented too much of a risk to their business and equipment			2
several contractors began the bidding process but never finished			0
mosque officials said one contractor told them that he needed the work but that the leaders of his own church were against the new @entity12 center			2
in september , @entity24 , the @entity42 judge , ruled that the @entity3 group had a right to build the larger facility			0
in the opinion , @entity24 said organizations must be treated equally under current land - use ordinances , but added that some of the county 's land use laws are " in dire need of revision			2
" @entity24 also wrote that the plaintiffs suing @entity42 's planning commission can challenge whether the mosque 's approval violated open meeting laws			1
that led to the lawsuit and trial that was decided this week			0
opponents of the mosque have also argued that @entity232 is not a real religion deserving of @entity273 protections and claimed that the @entity12 has links to terrorism , @entity125 reported			2
the judge dismissed those allegations , the affiliate reported			0
the congregation has outgrown its old facility and worshippers have to pray outside the crowded mosque , said @entity11 , the leader of the @entity54			1
" i am confident that @entity30 values will prevail in this , " the imam said			0
" what makes @entity30 so special is how it handles freedom			0
this decision does not seem like it reflects @entity30 values			0
