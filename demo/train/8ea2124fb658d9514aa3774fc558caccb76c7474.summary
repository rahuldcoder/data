-- the one really big question hanging over president @entity3 's weekend vacation to @entity4 , @entity5 , now has an answer			1
will he or wo n't he dive into the water to send a message that the @entity10 is back ? the answer : he will , and sooner than expected			1
" i think we 're going to go tomorrow and as i just said @entity13 , i 'm not going to let you guys take a picture of me with my shirt off , " @entity3 jokingly told @entity0 saturday			1
" you guys will tease me just like last time			0
i was on the front page ... people commenting			2
" but just hours later , a photo was published on the @entity24 flickr page showing a smiling president @entity3 and his daughter @entity26 taking a dip in the @entity10 waters off @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity5			1
no reporters or press cameras were present for the swim , but the image will nonetheless send a message that the @entity24 has sought to convey with the first family 's trip : the @entity10 is open for business			1
@entity3 caused a bit of a tabloid stir when he took off his shirt to reveal a muscular physique during trips to @entity44 during the 2008 presidential campaign and subsequent presidential transition			1
but some are less concerned about @entity3 ending up on magazine covers , and more worried about the @entity24 sending the right message			1
" absolutely , i want him to take his shirt off and get in the water and show it 's clean and safe , " said @entity50 , a professor at @entity51 in @entity52 who puts together an annual list of @entity55 's best beaches			0
@entity50 rates the beach there as one of the top 10 in the country , and he said @entity3 has a unique opportunity to showcase the fact that the @entity10 is still open for business despite the worst oil spill in @entity55 history			1
" it 's got lily - white sand , and frankly the oil did n't really make it there			0
it was pretty well spared , " said @entity50 , who noted that the water is 87 or 88 degrees because of the steamy @entity5 weather , making it conducive to at least a quick presidential plunge			0
" there is no better symbol than the president of the @entity55 showing us the way , " @entity50 said			1
@entity24 press secretary @entity83 was cagey friday when reporters asked whether the president will take a swim during the first family 's 27 - hour mini-vacation			1
" stay tuned , " said @entity83 , who grew slightly impatient and a bit bemused about getting so many queries about something as seemingly minor as a presidential swim			2
" look , he 's going to have some fun , " @entity83 said			0
" whether or not he gets in the water is up for clearly some debate			0
but , look , he will have an opportunity to enjoy ... the physical beauty of the @entity10 and do some work at the same time			1
" @entity83 turned it around on reporters and wondered whether they would bare their midriffs this weekend			0
" are you bringing your suits ? " @entity83 said with a smile			0
but @entity50 suggested it 's no joking matter because the president 's decision to swim or not to swim will carry tremendous symbolic weight			2
" i think it 's very important that he gets into the water because i think there 's this feeling that if you get in , you 're going to get contaminated or get all kinds of diseases , " he said			0
this is the president 's fifth trip to the @entity120 since the april 20 explosion that sparked the oil disaster			2
the trip is generating criticism over whether @entity3 is giving the region short shrift by spending only parts of saturday and sunday in @entity4			1
@entity24 officials announced the trip earlier this summer after critics wondered why the president and first lady had urged @entity55 to vacation in the @entity10 but originally chose @entity134 , @entity135 , and @entity136 , @entity137 , as the only locations for their own sojourns			1
now , the criticism has shifted to whether 27 hours in @entity4 is too quick of a jaunt , and the @entity141 released a statement friday that also said @entity3 has included @entity5 in only a couple of his trips to the region in recent months			1
" it 's nice to see the president take the time out of his busy schedule of golf games and campaign fundraisers to clear his conscience and visit @entity5 for only the second time since the oil crisis began , " @entity141 spokeswoman @entity145 said			0
" as he meets with business owners in the @entity157 , it seems like the perfect opportunity for him to explain how his reckless spending , tax increases , and government takeover of health care are supposed to help the @entity10 's devastated economy			1
not even the @entity5 can put a positive light on the president 's failed liberal policies that have sunk his approval ratings to an all - time low			0
" the president is accompanied by first lady @entity170 and their younger daughter @entity26			1
( the oldest , @entity173 , is still away at camp and will not be in @entity5 )			0
also making the trip is @entity10 recovery chief , secretary of the navy @entity177 , to try to show the administration is committed to a long - term turnaround			2
@entity83 largely deflected questions about whether the trip was too short , saying the president is focused on promoting the " health of the region " with the vacation			0
" @entity188 in @entity5 and along the @entity10 is the economy , " @entity83 told reporters friday			2
" this is an opportunity to highlight the notion that this important region of the country is still doing well and open for business			2
" while @entity50 said he does think the trip seems too short , @entity3 should be applauded for carving out some time to help the region			2
" i think it 's basically a photo - op , is n't it ? " said @entity50			0
" but i still think it 's a good thing for the president to come down and show the world that it 's clean and safe			0
that will go a long way to helping the @entity10			2
" @entity50 added : " the best thing that could happen is the president saying , ' i 'm going in ! ' and i do n't mean damn the torpedoes			0
i mean him saying , ' it 's clean and safe , and i 'm going in the water ! ' "			0
