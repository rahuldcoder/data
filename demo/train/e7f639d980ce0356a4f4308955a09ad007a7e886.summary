@entity0 the race for the next @entity4 president was evident on tuesday night as plenty of potential @entity7 contenders criticizing president @entity9 's tax proposals , while @entity10 , including @entity11 , defended the president 's @entity14 address			1
@entity15 took to @entity16 to argue that @entity9 was dismissing the message that voters sent to @entity0 when they voted for a @entity7 majority in november			1
@entity9 tax plan : middle - class credits , increases for rich " he ignores the fact that the country has elected a @entity26 that favors smaller government and lower taxes , " the 2012 @entity7 presidential nominee wrote			1
" his tax proposal is a maze of new taxes and complexities			0
" in his speech , @entity9 called for closing loopholes in the tax code that he says leads " to inequality by allowing the top 1 % to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth			2
" the president is proposing a total of $ 235 billion in tax credits that are aimed to help the middle class			2
to pay for it , @entity9 wants tax investment income -- capital gains and dividends -- at a higher rate , which could help bring in $ 320 billion			2
as expected , @entity7 widely panned the idea			2
former @entity50 gov. @entity49 acknowledged that some have benefited in the economic recovery but " far too many people have been left behind			0
" " it 's unfortunate president @entity9 wants to use the tax code to divide us -- instead of proposing reforms to create economic opportunity for every @entity4 , " he said on @entity16			1
" we can do better			0
" sen. @entity61 , in his own taped response , said " the president is redistributing the pie , but not growing it			0
" @entity65 gov. @entity64 blasted what he called @entity9 's " top - down , government - knows - best philosophy			1
" " our @entity4 revival is not going to be led by a lame - duck president who would rather pick fights with @entity26 , " he said in a statement			0
" it will be led â € ‹ by reformers who know how to get things done			0
" sen. @entity77 said in a statement that @entity9 's speech " doubles down on outdated proposals to tax and spend more			1
" he also ripped into the president over his recent @entity83 policy , saying it rewards " repressive , anti-american regimes			0
" joining " @entity87 " by phone , @entity77 later tweaked @entity9 's pitch to make community college free			1
" the single greatest impediment to community colleges today are not costs ... it 's the fact that at the end of that community college tunnel is that graduates do n't see jobs , " he told @entity1 's @entity90			0
separately , @entity77 told @entity1 's @entity98 that he felt @entity7 could work with @entity9 on some things , like increasing the child tax credit			1
" i do think we have to focus on child care costs in @entity4 , " he said			0
" they are very high for working families			0
" sen. @entity107 , in a statement criticizing @entity9 's speech , said , " @entity4 saw a powerful demonstration that it is time to move on beyond president @entity9			1
" the @entity110 @entity7 posted a taped response earlier in the night on his @entity113 page , but it was taken down			2
reporters noted that @entity107 appeared to mess up in the video and asked to start over			0
my friend , @entity119 many of the @entity7 were quick to sing the praises of @entity124 sen. @entity123 , who gave the @entity7 response , showing that it 's never a bad move to praise the new senator from the state that holds the nation 's first nominating contest			1
@entity49 said his " friend @entity119 offered a great contrast , " while @entity61 tweeted that his " friend " did a " great job tonight			0
" former sen. @entity135 , who 's spending five days in @entity124 next week , also tweeted a shout - out : " good job @ joniernst ! well delivered which drew a clear contrast			0
" @entity10 jump to @entity9 's defense @entity143 , for her part , backed the president on @entity145 , saying @entity9 pointed a way " to an economy that works for all			1
now we need to step up and deliver for the middle class			0
" the former secretary of state is considered the @entity10 frontrunner if she runs for president			0
sen. @entity154 of @entity155 said in a statement that @entity9 got it " right " and " laid out ways we can create more opportunities for working families			2
" outgoing @entity162 gov. @entity161 praised @entity9 's policies , saying in a statement , " the worst thing we could do is let recent economic progress be undercut by @entity7 efforts to undo critically important financial reforms			1
" some of the potential @entity7 contenders also criticized @entity9 's speech in real time			1
@entity61 , for example , jabbed @entity9 's push for free community college with multiple tweets			1
@entity61 's @entity16 account also set up a fact - check game where players could guess whether statements in @entity9 's previous addresses were " true " or " not so fast ... " @entity135 said a line that he agreed with was the idea that " we want people to not only share in @entity4 's success but contribute to its success			1
" on the @entity10 side , former sen. @entity187 , who 's announced a presidential exploratory committee , live - tweeted his thoughts during the speech			2
@entity1 's @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , and @entity196 contributed to this report .			0

potential @entity7 presidential candidates were quick to *lampoon* president @entity9 's tax policies
@entity11 backed @entity9 , saying he pointed a way " to an economy that works for all "
