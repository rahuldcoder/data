" it 's been decided by society that a 15 - year - old ca n't vote , ca n't join the armed forces and can not buy alcohol , because society has recognized that children do not have the ability to appreciate the long - term consequences of their actions , " he said			1
" but they can treat them as adults in court , when we have very capable remedies for them in the juvenile justice system , which is geared toward rehabilitation , " he said			2
@entity44 said he and the other two public defenders plan to make separate motions to the court asking that their clients be allowed to post bond			2

@entity29 's doctor told @entity2 the teen faces several more months in the hospital and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries			1
" they still have to perform several operations on him for skin grafting , but his parents are with him all the time , " said @entity108 , a hospital spokeswoman			0
" i do n't tell him what happened , " @entity29 's mother , @entity113 , told @entity2 affiliate @entity114			1

psychologists are often brought into cases involving teenagers and young adults to judge their mental capabilities and determine their competency to proceed			0
psychologists also must evaluate whether the defendants can talk about what happened and communicate effectively with defense attorneys			0
