-- if the world comes to an end today , it wo n't be the first time			1
at least on film , planet earth has been destroyed , decimated , and rebuilt countless times over , from a myriad of causes and in a variety of situations that even the @entity12 could n't have seen coming ( nuclear war ! aliens ! zombies ! )			1
if there 's one thing that most of the post-apocalyptic genre films have in common , it 's the glimmer of hope that perhaps we 'll still survive after all ( or at least the apes will )			2
we all know the big - scale disaster films ( " @entity25 , " " deep impact " ) , but what movies are actually worth your time if you truly only have one last day to live ? pick your favorite end of the world scenario , and enjoy one of these until the power goes out			1
shortages : " @entity32 " @entity35 ( @entity34 ) volunteers ( in her sister 's place ) to take part in a brutal and ritualistic " game " in which children are forced to fight to the death , as a penalty for a rebellious insurrection in a totalitarian version of @entity45 known as @entity46			2
since the war , goods and supplies are strictly controlled , hence the game 's reference to the starvation of @entity54 's people			1
@entity35 survives the game because she learned early on that if she did n't hunt her own food , her family would n't eat			1

makes you question your existence			0
you might also like : the " @entity145 " series			0
environmental destruction : " @entity147 " we have no one to blame but ourselves -- no aliens , zombies , vampires , or other monsters have ruined the @entity140 , but in our greed and stupidity , we 've turned the planet into one big trash dump , with nothing but cute little robots ( or waste allocation load lifters ) left to try to make it less of a mess			1
the only life left are cockroaches , until one little seedling tries to break through			0

this time , however , it ca n't be thwarted			1
no @entity174 space program can save us			0
we just have to prepare for the inevitable , but at least a depressed @entity176 is able to make the end a little easier for her sister and her son by just being there as @entity140 prepares for a collision course with another planet			1
makes you want to call your family			0
you might also like : " @entity185 " viral pandemic : " 12 monkeys " @entity188 is sent back from the future to try to isolate the cause of a pandemic that has caused most of civilization to live underground -- he wo n't be able to stop it , but maybe they can develop a cure or a vaccine			1
his time travel mechanism is n't perfect , so he 's jolted around to different times , causing him to miss what the cause is until too late , but at least we get some wacky @entity202 along the way			1
