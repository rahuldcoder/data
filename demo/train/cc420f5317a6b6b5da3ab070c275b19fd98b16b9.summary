-- after learning what was going on across the nation in regulating food and drink , especially the edict by @entity8 mayor @entity7 banning large sugary drinks , i could clearly see we needed a way to prevent government from placing additional regulation on small business owners in @entity15			1
a judge has invalidated @entity18 's ban on sugary drinks bigger than 16 ounces , which is a good move			2
but as a state legislator , and a restaurant owner , i wanted to prevent our industry from being regulated out of business			1
working with trade organizations , i came up with what 's being called the " @entity28 " bill -- @entity29 2687			1
it simply says that the @entity15 legislature retains the authority to make decisions about the regulation of food			1
this bill has been passed overwhelmingly by both the @entity37 and @entity29 , and we are expecting gov. @entity39 to sign it			1
@entity15 governor reviews ' @entity43 ' bill it will prevent a hodgepodge of regulations put in force by various municipalities			1
imagine owning a restaurant and , all of a sudden , your menu does n't meet regulations			2
an owner might have to restructure a menu and have new nutritional analyses conducted , which are very costly			2
many men and women have worked long hard hours just to make a living , and adding additional regulations and costs could simply force them out of business			0
the free market should determine what a business chooses to sell			1
if the market demands healthier choices , then business owners will meet the need			2
a regulation banning you from selling a sugary drink larger than 16 ounces will not have any impact on obesity			1
if people want a bigger size , they can simply buy two or more			0
opposing view : banning large sodas is legal and smart cities across the country are restricting consumers ' food choices in misguided attempts to battle obesity			1
the ideas for restrictions are endless : limiting the size of soft drinks , requiring calories to be posted , prohibiting toys in kids ' meals , prohibiting fast food restaurants in certain neighborhoods , and more			0
in @entity15 , from the farm to the grocery , the convenience store to the restaurant , all food is already regulated to ensure safety by divisions of the @entity103 @entity102 , the @entity104 , the state @entity105 and the state @entity107			1
the " @entity28 " bill simply assures consumers freedom of choice on what food and what size soft drinks they want to buy , and which restaurants they want to patronize			1
to be clear , @entity29 2687 does not restrict debate on food policy as it relates to public health and welfare			1
by making sure the debate takes place at the state level and not at hundreds of local levels , we can prevent a patchwork of regulations that create an uneven playing field			2
consistent and uniform application of food policy will actually benefit the public			0
it also does n't change current law for restaurants that operate 20 or more franchises , such as @entity134 's , @entity135 and @entity136			0
those will still be required to provide nutritional information to customers			0
so what role can local government play ? consider these positive and proactive initiatives : create community gardens to provide fresh fruits and vegetables			0
help create more walking paths and bike trails			0
work with school districts to mandate physical education			0
expand or set up weight loss programs through local parks and recreation departments			0
create educational programs using social media to educate young people			0
local government can and should play a large role in public health			0
strategic initiatives focusing on incentives and promotions will have a positive effect on the community			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			2

@entity167 , a @entity15 legislator and restaurant owner , *wrote* the " *anti-bloomberg* " bill
@entity29 prohibits local *jurisdictions* from regulating food and drink ; only state can do it
@entity167 says it will *protect* small businesses from hodgepodge of local *overregulations*
free market should guide what 's sold , he says ; other measures can combat obesity
