@entity0 , @entity1 -- in front of a cave deep in the monochromatic sandstone canyons of @entity0 , in southern @entity1 , sits a bright pink 1982 @entity7			1
the vehicle 's owner , @entity8 , calls it the couch surfing flag			0
@entity8 , 42 , sports long black dreadlocks to his shoulders rather than the traditional @entity1 headdress			0
he was dressed , during this cave surfer 's visit , in a pair of patched - up denim jeans			1
he 's registered as a host in @entity0 on the popular @entity20 travel website			1
the site , which was founded in 2003 , hosts a community of travelers who create profiles to share their extra couches or rooms with visitors			1
" @entity32 " can then send a request to sleep on a couch rather than in a traditional hotel when they travel			1
@entity8 , a bedouin who was born in the same cave he lives in today , was taken with the idea			1
after spending many years traveling back and forth from @entity35 where he met travelers using the nontraditional lodging option , he thought , " why not in @entity1 ? " about four years ago when he returned to @entity0 , he logged onto the site and posted , " i welcome you in my cave anytime " on his profile posted under the name @entity44			1
the same week he registered his cave on the website , he received five requests from potential travelers			1
the following week there were six more , and within the next few months , he was hosting more than 15 people , sometimes 20 , a month at his cave in the mountains of @entity0			1
" since i started , i think i 've had over 1,200 people come stay at my cave , " said @entity8			1
" not all from @entity56 , but they hear about me			0
it 's a pleasure to have people from all over the world to learn our culture			2
just come and stay with us			0
" the bedouin people , who were predominately desert dwellers , have inhabited the caves around @entity0 for hundreds of years			1
the ancient city , carved into the side of a mountain , dates back to nearly the 6th century @entity68 and was active through the time of the @entity70			0
tourists from across the globe descend on the ruins every day			0
just a 10 - minute drive from the ruins is where @entity8 's family decided to make their home hundreds of years ago			1
now the cave and the property belong to @entity82			1
the cave , which is no larger than 150 square feet , is uniquely modern			2
a row of solar - powered lights , a gift from a couch surfer , encircles the front of the cave entrance			2
when the sun sets past the @entity0 mountains , they are the only visible lights			1
the outside of the cave is hard stone , but @entity82 has done some decorating on the inside			1
the roof is painted black with stars circling the room			0
candlelight glows just bright enough to see some of the traditional @entity1 paintings he 's placed inside ; not included in that collection is the large @entity106 poster near the cave 's entrance			2
during a recent visit in april , a litter of newborn kittens had the run of the place			0
a guard dog , @entity115 , also lives at the cave			2
she 's friendly , and well - trained , but when she sleeps outside , she tends to get into barking matches with her own echo in the mountains			0
it 's all part of the experience			0
when asking @entity8 for the washrooms , he points to the mountains , and says , " far away please			0
" then when it 's time to sleep , @entity82 lines the inside of his cave with thin mats			1
everyone sleeps in the cave , which could easily fit around 10 people			1
" i really did n't have a lot expectations besides being in a cave , " said guest @entity134 , 24 , from @entity135 , @entity136 , " but it 's really been the five - star experience , much more than i would have expected			2
" on a recent night in april , @entity82 hosted @entity134 and his girlfriend , @entity141 , along with an @entity143 teacher from @entity144 and a backpacker from @entity146			1
the backpacker , @entity147 , had to overcome his suspicions about why hosts would be so willing to let strangers stay in their house , or in this case , cave			2
" i think there are some things being a bit western that people worry about			2
like you letting someone into your house , and why is it all free , but i think 99 % of the time everything is fine , and you 've just got to trust people , " @entity147 said			2
@entity82 hosts his guests for free			1
it 's part of the @entity56 policy , but he 's done pretty well with gifts			0
couch surfers often bring items from their home country to share with him			2
it 's also polite to chip in for food , gas and drinks			0
for @entity82 , hosting foreigners at his cave is now his favorite activity			1
he often brings them out into the mountains to a hiking route through the ancient city			0
on this trip , he acted as a personal tour guide , picking the group up in his bright pink jeep , a vehicle all the children wave at as it drives by			0
when he speaks about his city , his culture and his cave , you can see the pride in his eyes and hear it in his voice			2
" i was born here			0
i stay here , and i live here , " he said			0
" my grandfather is here , my mother and father			0
so i travel and stay somewhere else , but one day , i must always come back to my roots			0
" and his sharing of his @entity204 family roots and culture in the form of hospitality to strangers makes visitors want to stay			0
" their flights always come , and they must always leave , but in their minds , they always want to stay longer			0
