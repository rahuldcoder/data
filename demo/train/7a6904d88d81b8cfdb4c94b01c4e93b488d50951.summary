-- an audio message believed to be from @entity3 leader @entity2 sought to halt infighting among jihadist groups in @entity6 , urging them instead to turn their arms against @entity10			1
in a 26 - minute audio message posted on a jihadist website friday , @entity2 called on the @entity6 's @entity3 affiliate @entity13 , also known as @entity13 , to stop fighting the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
@entity0 can not independently verify the authenticity of the message			0
a voice that appears similar to previous messages from @entity2 ordered @entity13 general commander " @entity20 and soldiers in @entity13 , and all other mujahedeen groups in @entity6 , to immediately stop fighting and aggression against their brothers and all @entity10 , and should focus on fighting the enemies of @entity27 from @entity28 , ( @entity29 ) and their @entity10 allies			1
" the @entity3 leader also passed on orders for @entity14 leader @entity32 and his followers to focus on the fight in @entity35 , where sectarian violence has reached the highest levels in more than five years , often pitting @entity38 , a minority in @entity35 , against @entity10			1
" @entity42 on @entity35 even if you felt that you have been oppressed and taken advantage of , to stop this bloodshed and focus [ on ] enemies of @entity46 and @entity38 people in @entity35 , " the message said			1
the call for a truce among jihadist groups comes as some 60,000 people have been forced to flee the northern @entity6 province of @entity53 in recent days amid clashes between the rival organizations , the @entity57 - based opposition group , @entity58 , said via @entity59 saturday			1
at least 62 fighters have been killed in fighting over the past four days , the @entity58 said			0
the clashes pit @entity13 and another group against @entity14 , according to the @entity58			1
@entity3 splinter group @entity14 this week staged bodies to look like they were crucified in the northern @entity6 city of @entity66			2
the group said the brutal display served to send a message to anyone who dares challenge its rule			0
the group carried out seven public executions in @entity66 on tuesday , but only two bodies were displayed afterward , according to the @entity58			0
the men in @entity66 were shot in the head before being affixed to crosses			0
the displays of their bodies appear to be largely symbolic acts by @entity14 followers against members of their own @entity85 sect for perceived acts of treason			2
as @entity6 's civil war creates a power vacuum , groups such as @entity14 have stepped in with their own form of radical @entity93 law to rule over an exhausted and terrorized civilian population			1
in a recent long - ranging interview , @entity2 urged @entity10 to capture westerners as pawns that might be used to free prisoners aligned with his movement			2
asked what he 'd tell " muslims and the mujahedeen " -- a term used for some @entity104 militants -- to do to " fulfill their duty " toward their allies in custody , @entity2 said last week , " i advise them to capture @entity96 -- and especially the @entity112 , as much as they can -- to exchange them for our captives			0
" @entity2 touched on an array of topics in a question - and - answer session with @entity3 's media arm , audio of which was published on the radical @entity104 website @entity121			0
@entity0 could not independently verify the authenticity of the recording			0
in the first part of the interview , which was posted online two weeks ago , @entity2 insisted @entity3 is holding strong and , in fact , " expanding " 13 years after the @entity112 launched its " war on terror " following the september 11 , 2001 , attacks .			2

@entity2 calls for truce between @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity6
he orders @entity14 to focus on @entity35 , where violence has reached the highest levels in years
some 60,000 people have fled @entity6 province @entity53 amid clases between the rival groups
