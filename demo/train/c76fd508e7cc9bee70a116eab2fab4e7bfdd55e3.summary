-- if you 're looking for a little black box to put under your tv set and devices like the @entity5 , @entity6 , or any of the many @entity8 boxes are n't doing it for you , @entity10 may have your hookup			1
@entity12 is reporting that @entity13 is working on its own set - top box centered on its services , and the company will apparently introduce the box in the fall			1
other details about the box itself are light on the ground			0
all we know for now is that it may share the @entity26 branding with the @entity13 's line of e-readers and @entity30 tablets , and that the device is being developed by the company 's @entity33 division			2
( this group is also responsible for the rest of the @entity26 hardware			0
) as with the @entity26 e-book library , you do n't actually need to own one of @entity13 's devices to access @entity13 's video contentâ € ” you can already play @entity44 on consoles like the @entity46 and @entity47 just as you can get @entity26 books on your @entity49 or @entity51 tablet			2
@entity13 's strategy with the @entity54 tablets has been to price them attractively and put its own content front - and - center , as well as give its users special perks like the @entity59			1
a theoretical @entity13 set - top box would likely take a similar approach to distinguish itself from the other little - boxes - with - hdmi - ports that crowd this market			1
@entity13 's last major hardware announcement was the @entity66 reveal back in september of 2012			0
if the company has a similar event around in the fall this year , that 's when we 'd expect this box to be introduced			0

@entity13 is making a set - top box that would stream content to a tv , a report says
the device reportedly will go on sale this fall
@entity13 would likely put its own content front - and - center on the device
