@entity158 @entity29 : the @entity138 military has opened a hearing related to last year 's deadly shooting at @entity5 in @entity6			1
@entity162 -- he 's a @entity138 citizen -- is accused of the attack			1
authorities say @entity162 killed 13 people and wounded 32 others when he allegedly opened fire at the military base			0

the colonel in charge is considering a request from @entity162 's attorney to delay the hearing until november			1
drilling moratorium @entity29 : yesterday , we talked about a moratorium , a delay or stop in activity			0
we 've got another one we 're reporting on for you today			2
this is the moratorium on deep - water oil drilling , and it 's over			2
the @entity189 made that announcement yesterday			0
the moratorium started after the oil spill in the @entity193 earlier this year			0
officials say there will always be risks with drilling , but that they 've come up with new rules and regulations to help reduce those risks			2
just the facts @entity202 , @entity14 : just the facts ! stem cells are the human body 's master cells			1
that means they can become different types of cells , like heart or liver cells , for example			2
scientists believe that stem cells can be used to treat different types of diseases			1
two kinds of stem cells are adult and embryonic			1
adult stem cells are found in tissues like bone marrow			1
embryonic stem cells come from human embryos that are four to six days old			1
stem cell injection @entity29 : using stem cells to treat diseases is still pretty experimental			1
but for the first time , cells from an embryonic stem cell have been injected into a human			1
adult stem cells , not too much controversy with those			1
but embryonic stem cells , that 's where this debate gets intense , because in order to get those , the embryo has to be destroyed			1
we do n't know much information about this person who was injected with the embryonic stem cells			1
it was part of a medical study on patients with spinal cord injuries			2
in order to qualify for the study , you have to be completely paralyzed from the chest down			0
scientists are hoping the stem cells will help make a new spinal cord for the patient			1
@entity257 @entity258 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity261 's 8th grade class at @entity262 in @entity263 , @entity264 ! which word describes someone who is at least 100 years old ? is it : a ) @entity269 , b ) centenarian , c ) septuagenarian or @entity271 ) @entity272 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a centenarian is at least 100 years old			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! 101 - year - old citizen @entity29 : @entity280 is a centenarian			1
she has lived almost all of her 101 years in the @entity138			1
but this centenarian just became a @entity138 citizen yesterday ! @entity280 came here from @entity285 when she was a baby , exactly 101 years ago yesterday			1
in 1941 , she got a " @entity288 " card from the @entity138 government			1
so , she 's been living here legally			2
but @entity280 recently decided to make it official			0
she filed papers , passed the citizenship test , and yesterday , became a full citizen			2
so one question : why do it now ? in her words , " i want to spend the rest of my days in this life living legally in the @entity138			1
" blog report @entity29 : our show , your voice			0
we 're taking it to our blog ! from yesterday 's program : was @entity310 's right when it forfeited a football game in the name of safety ? or should they have taken the challenge in the name of sportsmanship ? from @entity320 : " players are being taught to quit when it looks tough			2
why choose to fail when success is an option ? " from @entity324 : " everything 's not about winning or losing ; it 's all about trying			2
" and @entity325 says , " we are playing football here			0
i think they need to suck it up and play			0
" " by not playing the game , @entity333 is teaching their student athletes that when you face adversity , you back down			0
" that quote from another student named @entity341			0
@entity342 wrote , " it was a good idea for them to back out of the game because they would 've gotten crushed and probably injured by the other players			0
" but from @entity352 : " when you decide to play a sport , you have to understand there will always be bigger and better			2
no one practices not to play			0
" if you need a refresher on this story , you can find it at @entity356 in yesterday 's show			2
and as a reminder : we only publish first names on our blog ; we only read first names on our program			0
before we go @entity29 : before we go , they do n't sell this in your school cafeteria			0
we are heading to the @entity367			0
some vendors there are building one intense burger			0
you start off with the beef , like you see			0
but then -- here comes the interesting part -- you slap on the top half of the bun , which is a donut ! they recommend not using ketchup or mustard on this			0
they would n't want to ruin the taste			0
if you like eating your dessert at the same time as your entree ... goodbye @entity29 : this sounds like the perfect meal , donut ? donut ? do n't know if that worked			0
maybe your eyes just glaze over at that burger ; maybe they glaze over at that pun			0
or maybe you think it 's all in bad taste			2
either way , there are no arguments from us			0
we do n't want to start a beef with anybody			0
hope you have an awesome day			0
we 'll see you tomorrow , when @entity0 returns			0
