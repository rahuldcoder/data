-- imagine searching the country of @entity2 for three pieces of metal , the largest about the size of half a tennis court -- a moving tennis court			1
that 's the reality for searchers in the south @entity10 as they look for two objects , a satellite find that @entity14 officials call the strongest lead in the search for @entity17 and its 239 passengers			1
a third object was spotted by a @entity21 satellite on march 18 and made public saturday			2
the objects are drifting in one of the most inaccessible places on @entity25 , giving search planes only about two hours before they have to return to @entity14			1
ships from several countries are assisting in the search , but have n't turned up anything			0
and conditions are n't helping			0
massive waves , high winds and currents could push the three objects farther east and farther apart , according to a @entity37 simulation			2
below the water 's surface lies an even murkier search climate with the sea floor 9,000 feet down and deeper than most submarines can go			1
a mid-ocean ridge in the area has peaks and valleys like the @entity47			0
that could meet pinpointing the site of possible wreckage harder still			0
