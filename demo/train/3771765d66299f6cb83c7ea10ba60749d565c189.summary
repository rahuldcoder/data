the five - minute video opens with a man cruising along in his car , cracking open a bottle of what appears to be @entity6 's beer and taking a swig			1
" we all know drinking and driving is against the law			1
you 're not supposed to do that			2
but they did n't say anything about driving and then drinking , " the man says to the camera			1
" you just have to be learned enough to understand the symbols of drunkenness			2
" the man , @entity21 , posted the clip in february under the title " @entity28 ! " to @entity24 , a video - sharing site where users can vote on and donate to videos they like			1
even so , he appeared surprised when police showed up at his house in @entity31 , @entity32 , to arrest him on charges of consuming alcohol while operating a vehicle and driving without a license			1
" it 's unbelievable , " @entity21 told @entity39			2
he says the video was meant as a parody			1
" there was no beer in that bottle			2
" @entity46 is due in court in june , and police in @entity49 told @entity39 the case will come down to whether a judge or jury believes him			1
" our traffic laws are in place for a reason , and mr. @entity21 's blatant disregard for those laws is the type of behavior that wo n't be tolerated , " said @entity49 police chief @entity54 in a statement			2
social networks offer platforms for us to share everything on the @entity67 , from our relationship statuses to our political leanings and photos of our pets and children			2
but some people are discovering that what they share on @entity75 , @entity76 and other platforms constitutes evidence that can be used against them in a court of law			1
related : when evidence of sex assault goes viral one expert told @entity39 that anything posted online is material the government can use as evidence to arrest and charge a person			1
" in criminal cases , almost all evidence is discoverable and police can obtain the evidence , " said @entity88 , a @entity89 - area lawyer specializing in social media law			1
" it 's just a matter of what hoops they have to jump through			0
" the government can subpoena deleted content from social media companies , as a judge did from @entity76 for a case involving an occupy @entity105 protester in july 2012			1
but sometimes , law enforcement does n't have to jump through any hoops to collect potentially incriminating evidence -- they just have to click around online			1
" it 's like that old saying , " said professor @entity109 , who teaches evidence and criminal law at @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114			1
" do n't put anything on your @entity75 page you would n't tell your mother , or the local police department			0
" @entity123 the most high - profile recent example of this was in @entity123 , @entity126 , where social media played a role in the case of two football players who were found guilty last month of raping a drunken 16 - year - old girl			1
the girl did n't remember much of what happened when @entity133 , 17 , and @entity134 , 16 , sexually assaulted her at a party in august of 2012			0
her family and law enforcement learned of the assault after cell phone pictures and videos , taken by partygoers , popped up on @entity75 and other sites			1
one key piece of evidence was an @entity146 photo of the two boys carrying the girl out of a house			0
@entity133 , who shared photos of the girl naked and passed out , was also found guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor			0
the case caught fire on both conventional media and social media after a crime blogger and former @entity123 resident , @entity158 , uncovered some of the photos , videos and messages posted online about the incident and accused the town of giving the boys preferential treatment because they played on the football team			1
just last month , two teenage girls were arrested and charged with intimidating a witness after police said they made threats against the victim on @entity76			1
prosecutors have said they are considering additional charges against witnesses who refused to speak up			0
a grand jury will meet april 30 to hear evidence			0
' ... to whoever 's vehicle i hit i am sorry ' early on the morning of january 1 of this year , police in @entity183 , @entity184 , responded to a call about a hit - and - run on a residential street			0
there they found two cars had been sideswiped by an unknown driver , leaving behind a bumper cover and pieces of a taillight			0
later that day , an officer received a private @entity75 message alerting her to a @entity75 status update recently posted by @entity183 resident @entity197 , 18			1
it read , " drivin drunk ... classsic ; ) but to whoever 's vehicle i hit i am sorry			0
: p " officers went to @entity197 's home and arrested him after finding a damaged vehicle missing pieces that matched those left behind at the crime scene			1
in an interview with @entity211 affiliate @entity210 , the owner of one of the damaged vehicles said what everyone watching the case was probably thinking : " why would you post that ? he basically just turned himself in			1
" @entity197 told @entity210 that his @entity75 status update was " a big joke " and that he sideswiped the cars because of icy conditions			0
he is due in court april 22			0
@entity88 , the social media law expert , said he would never allow a client to post anything like that online			1
but he argued that @entity197 's post alone would not be enough for a @entity227 conviction			0
prosecutors would need additional evidence , such as a blood - alcohol - level report , he said			0
" you want to focus on charging someone with something you can prove in the court of law , " he said			2
that may explain why police said @entity197 is charged not with driving under the influence but with two counts of " failing to perform the duties of a driver			2
" the @entity242 a group of young partiers in @entity245 gave authorities plenty of online evidence last month after a binge - drinking journey through the city 's subways			1
the group participated in what they called the @entity242 , with plans to drink a beer at every station on the 30 - stop orange line			0
they made it to 18 stations before losing focus , according to a post about it on @entity263 , a blog about youth culture in @entity245			0
" i guess alcohol got the best of us and we completely forgot what was going on at one point but in my opinion that makes us all winners ! " said the march 25 post , which has since been taken down			0
the group also posted photos , some with blurred faces , of members chugging beers on the trains and urinating at the subway stations -- both violations of city ordinances			2
news sites republished some of the photos , and authorities took notice			0
@entity245 police are now investigating the incidents and have asked for help in identifying the participants			0
a lawyer representing some of the partiers involved is negotiating with investigators , @entity245 police said			0
@entity299 and the @entity300 have similar protections against suspects incriminating themselves while in custody , but voluntary gloating or confessions online are free game for law enforcement , legal experts said			1
" what the @entity308 protects against is compulsory confessions , " @entity109 said			0
" no one compelled them to take photos of themselves drinking and peeing			2
" " the problem is that people do n't realize that you ca n't take it back , " added @entity88			0
" it 's almost impossible to unpost something			0
" when posting a photo is a crime it 's one thing to be arrested for posting a photo that shows you breaking the law			1
it 's another to be arrested for posting a photo of someone else 's handiwork			1
in another case of social media consequences in @entity245 , a woman was arrested earlier this month after she posted a photo on @entity146 of graffiti she spotted on a city wall that depicted a high - ranking @entity245 police officer with a bullet hole in his head			1
@entity339 , 20 , was accused of criminal harassment and intimidation , according to @entity245 police			0
" i think the person behind the artwork should be in my place ... all i did was take a photo , " she told the @entity343			2
@entity339 has not been formally charged but is scheduled to appear in court on may 24			0
a @entity245 police spokesperson said there 's more behind her arrest than just the posting of the photo , but declined to offer further details			2
legal experts say photos and videos , whether posted publicly online or obtained in a more discreet manner by the police , have to meet the same criteria : they must be authenticated , meaning the prosecutors must prove the images are what they seem and have not been altered or staged			1
and they ca n't be shown out of context			0
" you ca n't just show a snippet that makes it seem worse than it is , " said @entity109 , the @entity112 law professor			2
when the accused admit to posting the materials themselves , authentication is n't as much of a question			1
but in the cases of @entity46 , in @entity32 , and @entity197 , in @entity184 , the incriminating posts put them in the awkward position of having to disavow their own words , experts say			2
either way , @entity109 says , criminals ' trumpeting their crimes is nothing new			0
" people have always said foolish things , " @entity109 said , " but now they have the ability to say it louder and to more people			0

law enforcement can obtain virtually anything posted online and use it against a person
one man was arrested for posting a video of himself driving and drinking online
@entity398 sharing played a large part in the highly publicized @entity123 rape case
defendants may have to deny their own words if they admit to a crime online
