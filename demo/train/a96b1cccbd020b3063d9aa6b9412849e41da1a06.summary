elections in @entity1 on sunday are about much more than one country			1
they could mark a big step toward democracy			2
if the country 's transition toward democracy " continues to move forward , it would be a powerful signal that democracy can take root in the @entity14 world , " said @entity6 of the @entity7			1
" at a time when hopes of moving towards political reform and accountable governments elsewhere in the @entity14 world have been dashed , @entity1 is the only country where the aspirations of the @entity14 uprisings may yet be fulfilled in the near future , " @entity6 wrote in an analysis			1
" even if @entity1 's example does not inspire any immediate followers in the region , the consolidation of a successful democracy in the country would be a powerful signal that reform and political pluralism are not doomed to fail in the @entity14 world			1
" tunisians headed to the polls to vote for their first post-revolution parliament , marking the end of three years of transitional governance that has been marred by rising extremism and economic failure			1
the atmosphere was tense in the country labeled the cradle of the 2011 @entity42 : over 70,000 members of security forces and heavily armored trucks patrolled the main streets , amid threat of attack from terror groups			2
more than 5 million people , about half the population , registered to vote			2

more than 100 political parties are running			1
the two front - runners are the @entity62 party , which headed up a transitional coalition government before being forced to give up power earlier this year , and @entity65 , a secular group led by a former @entity57 parliament speaker			2
the two offer widely different visions of @entity1			1
their respective popularity highlights the political polarization that has slowed down real change in the country			2
despite the security fears , by mid-morning long lines of people queued to cast their ballots in downtown @entity79 ' @entity78 district , home to one of the capital 's main voting centers			0
@entity1 's rising unemployment and trend of jihadism were the main topics being enthusiastically discussed by voters as they waited			1
" today is vital so that we do not witness what we just went through in the last three years			0
everything got worse after the revolution : security , economy , social problems , " said @entity91 , who was voting for @entity65			0
he criticized by the @entity97 for being " old regime " because of their leader 's @entity57 - era political appointments			0
the 61 - year - old mechanic said the last three years had hit the youth the hardest and he had struggled to help his children find work			0
the youth unemployment rate here is over 40 %			0
since the revolution , the number of people under the poverty line has doubled while the corrupt practices that marked the old regime are still prevalent , crushing the economy			0
" i pushed my kids into odd jobs like construction work just to protect them from any @entity118 brainwashing , which is worryingly prevalent here			0
the youngsters are particularly vulnerable as they are seduced by money and the promise of having a greater ' purpose , ' " he said , adding that a strong secular leadership -- headed up by @entity65 -- will help combat radical islamism			0
( the @entity118 are ultra-conservative @entity128 who are becoming an increasingly strident political force across the @entity14 world in the wake of the @entity42			1
) @entity1 is lauded as the sole success story of the @entity42 but in recent years has been struggling to fight a rising insurgency anchored in its rural and border areas			1
over 3,000 @entity1 have travelled to @entity135 to fight with extremist groups like @entity137 , which calls itself the @entity138 , and @entity141 affiliate @entity139 -- making @entity1 the single largest contributor of foreign fighters			1
there are whole neighborhoods in @entity79 where heads of the more extreme @entity118 mosques have persuaded young people to become extremist militants both in @entity1 and abroad			2
on friday , the run - up to the elections was marred by a deadly standoff between police and suspected militants in @entity155 , a northern suburb of @entity79			0
seven people were killed , including five women and a police officer , after a special forces unit raided a home housing " terrorists , " according to the @entity162			0
at polling stations , people said they hoped the country 's political leadership could rally together to stabilize @entity1 and stop it from descending into chaos like neighboring @entity42 country @entity168			1
" all must come together , not one person or party can lead @entity1 in its next journey , " said @entity170 , 44 , a civil servant voting in downtown @entity79			2
