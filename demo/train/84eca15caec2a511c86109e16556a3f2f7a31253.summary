@entity0 , @entity1 -- in parts of rural @entity1 a fierce battle is going on between the @entity5 and the country 's government			1
and the victims in this battle , it seems , are school children			0
recently , the @entity5 demanded the closure of some schools in two eastern provinces			1
in @entity15 province , the closure of schools was in retaliation for the government 's ban on motorbikes often used by insurgents			1
in @entity22 province , the @entity5 has been a little more compromising , locals say , and has allowed some schools to open late after making changes to the curriculum			1
" the @entity5 are fine with us as long as we do what they want			1
they tell us what to teach and what not to			0
if we do n't do what they say they have a representative who comes checking things , " one teacher said			0
" they have increased the number of hours we teach religious subjects in a week and decreased other subjects like @entity41			0
if we did n't , they would threaten teachers , and it is very much possible that they would close the school down			0
" this power struggle in classrooms is symptomatic of broader fears about the future			1
as the @entity51 - led military effort winds down in @entity1 will the @entity5 tighten its grip on daily life in the country ? @entity2 's cameras were allowed in one classroom in @entity22 but those interviewed will not be identified for their own safety			1
in this classroom , teaching is allowed but a @entity5 minder oversees the syllabus			2
one student in the class says he does not mind			0
" the @entity5 have only increased the religious subjects in our day - to - day schedule , which is very good as people should learn religious subjects , " he said			2
@entity70 , a deputy education minister said the government has to be flexible in order to keep schools open			0
in areas where the @entity5 had more control , sometimes the government lets them influence what subjects are taught and even allows them to check student attendance , @entity70 said			2
" there was no deal between the government and the @entity5 , but only in order to keep the schools open and running the @entity84 had shown flexibility to this issue , " he said			1
one @entity5 school minder spoke to @entity2 but chose to cover his face on camera so that he could not be identified			2
" we did n't allow schools to be opened here at the beginning of the school year because we wanted them to change , " the @entity5 minder said			1
" then we had a big meeting with school officials and concluded we would allow school to start , but teaching should be according to our principles and @entity100 principles			0
we have only increased @entity100 subjects so that even when a person becomes an engineer , he should have enough knowledge in @entity100			0
" the minder said he was implementing instructions from @entity5 leader @entity110 as are many others across @entity1 .			0

" the @entity5 are fine with us as long as we do what they want , " a teacher says
this power struggle in classrooms is symptomatic of broader fears
some wonder if the @entity5 will tighten its grip on daily life as *war* nears an end
