-- a video purporting to be from a vigilante group whose goal is the eradication of the @entity7 cartel from the state of @entity9 , @entity10 , has surfaced on the @entity11 , but its credibility remains unproven			1
five masked men dressed in black appear on the video , sitting behind a long table			0
the spokesman explains that they are a group called the " @entity7 , " or @entity18			1
they describe themselves as an " extermination " force that works as the armed front " of the people and for the people			0
" the speaker says that the group 's only goal is to kill members of the @entity7 , a ruthless cartel whose area of influence includes the eastern state of @entity9			1
members of the @entity7 are prohibited from committing crimes such as extortion or kidnappings , according to the video			2
the video was released via @entity38 days after 35 bodies were found in two trucks during rush hour in the city of @entity43			0
but is the video really evidence of the birth of a vigilante group in @entity9 ? in the video , the speaker does not claim responsibility for the 35 deaths			1
it is also not the first time that a seemingly grassroots group emerged in @entity9 as a counterbalance to the cartels			2
in 2007 , a group named the " @entity60 , " or @entity61 , made itself known through menacing notes , web - posted videos , torture and executions and quasi-patriotic rhetoric			0
the group left notes next to bodies , claiming that the victims were @entity7 or supporters of the @entity7			2
but @entity67 officials with knowledge of the group said @entity60 was not a vigilante group but a facade for the @entity72 , which at the time was battling the @entity7 and @entity74 in @entity9			1
the @entity7 and @entity76 cartel have since split into warring factions			2
@entity10 's attorney general 's office responded with a statement saying that it would investigate the video and any group that tries to take justice into its own hands			1
" the only path to reach long - lasting security and peace is through the rule of law and strengthening of our institutions , " the statement said			0
in october of last year , another possible paramilitary group surfaced in @entity94 state			0
a group calling itself the " @entity96 " distributed fliers indicating its members would fight against kidnappers , murderers and other criminals .			0

a group called " @entity18 " releases a video on the *internet*
the group says its goal is to exterminate the @entity7 cartel from @entity9 state
authorities say that they will investigate any group that takes justice into their own hands
