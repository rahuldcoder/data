over 3,000 hours in the air			0
a staggering 4.6 million square kilometers of ocean			2
the numbers speak to the breadth of the search for the missing @entity6			2
the results speak to the fruitlessness of it			0
the plane , carrying 239 people , disappeared on march 8			0
and despite an expansive search involving 26 countries , officials have nothing to show for it			1
so authorities are moving on to the next phase of the search -- one that will be even more challenging			1
" we know very clearly the area of the follow - up search will be even broader , with more difficulties and tougher tasks , " @entity21 transport minister @entity20 said monday			1
what 's next @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity21 officials will meet in @entity31 , @entity29 , on wednesday to hash out plans for the next stage of the hunt			1
one group will analyze the data and information collected so far			1
another will look at the resources needed			0
the data audit will look at information gathered since the beginning of the search			1
" it will also look again at the satellite information that 's been accumulated so that we can make sure that it 's been accurately interpreted , " @entity29 deputy prime minister @entity44 said			1
authorities have relied on satellite information and pings believed to be from the plane 's flight data recorders in picking their search area			1
but with an expanded search area comes the most challenging task ahead : scouring uncharted territory			1
a key element of the new phase will be a detailed mapping of the ocean floor			2
" we know that the water is very deep , " @entity44 said			1
" and for the next stage involving sonar and other autonomous vehicles , potentially at very great depths , we need to have an understanding of the ocean floor to be able to undertake that kind of search effectively and safely			2
" @entity44 said he 's not sure how deep the ocean is in the expanded search area because " it 's never been mapped			1
" the tools the next stage of the hunt will involved highly specialized technology , including towed side - scan sonar and more autonomous underwater vehicles , @entity44 said			0
" you can count on one hand the number of devices that can do this work , when you talk about towed sonar devices , " said @entity80 , chief coordinator of the joint search effort			1
@entity44 said he 's optimistic that the new devices will be in the water within a month or two			1
in the meantime , he said , the @entity91 - 21 drone will continue underwater missions			0
the @entity94 has already scanned 400 square kilometers of the @entity96 floor , but with no luck			0
the @entity98 has authorized the use of the drone for another month			0
the cost ? about $ 40,000 a day			1
while the @entity94 provides greater resolution than deep - towed sonar devices , the drone can only go about 4.5 kilometers deep			1
the cost @entity29 estimates the next phase of the search will cost about $ 60 million , @entity44 said			1
he said officials will consult with @entity30 , @entity21 and other parties on how that cost would be shared			2
until now , all countries involved in the search have paid for their own costs			0
" whenever we 've asked , people have come forward , " @entity44 said			0
but " i think we 'll be looking at increasing involvement from the manufacturers and their host countries			0
" letting others in the new phase will allow more parties to join the search , acting @entity30 transport minister @entity122 said			2
" this gives an opportunity to those not involved in the early phase of the search and rescue efforts to come on board , " he said			2
those could involve research institutions and more countries , he said			0
@entity44 said most of the new equipment will likely have to come from the private sector			0
lessons learned it took two years to find the wreckage of @entity138 in the @entity139			0
@entity44 said authorities can learn from that effort			0
" there were some quite long gaps in their search , and we do n't want that to happen in this instance , " he said			0
" that 's why we 're starting work this week on actually putting together the next stages of the search			0
" but as officials from this search have already learned , hope can dash as quickly as it arises			2
" we 've been confident on the basis of the information provided that the search area was the right one , " @entity44 said			1
" but in practice , that confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the aircraft			0

officials will *review* data to see if satellite information has been " accurately interpreted "
more high - tech devices will be used over an expanded search area
the search area will expand to deep water that has " never been mapped "
@entity29 estimates the next phase will cost $ 60 million
