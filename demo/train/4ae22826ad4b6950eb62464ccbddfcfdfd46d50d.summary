-- when the e-mail arrived the other day , i knew instantly who it was from			1
at least i thought i did			2
i recognized the e-mail address			1
it belonged to @entity6 , an old and treasured friend			1
when i was a beginning sportswriter , @entity6 was the veteran star of the central @entity8 paper where we worked			2
he gave me my first byline , a kindness for which , as i have told him many times , i am forever grateful			2
he is long retired from daily newspaper work now , living in @entity17 , but we write back and forth from time to time			2
so i was startled by the first words of his note : " i 'm writing this with tears in my eyes			1
" he apologized for " this odd request			2
" he said he was in the @entity27 , on a vacation in @entity29 with his family			2
he said they had been robbed , at gunpoint			2
everything had been taken : cash , credit cards , cell phone			0
he seemed embarrassed to have to be asking : he wondered if i could lend him some money so he and his family could get back home			1
he promised to refund it as soon as he was back in the @entity40 he wanted me to wire it to him : " please do get back to me as soon as possible			0
" and he signed it : " @entity6			0
" i felt so bad for him			0
he 's no longer a young man , and i was touched that , in a crisis , he would turn to me			0
i 've never wired money to anyone before , but i started making calls to find out how to do it			1
then something started to feel wrong to me			0
i looked at his e-mail again			1
the address was his , all right			1
but there were some sloppy phrases in the note : run - on sentences , lowercase words that should have been capitalized , some incorrect grammar			0
@entity6 was always an extremely careful writer ; he was a disciple of the @entity62 stylebook			0
he did n't make mistakes like that			0
there were other off - key things in the note			0
he said he was in @entity29 with his family ; i knew that his wife had passed away 15 years ago			0
he said that they " came down here on a short vacation " ; those of us from central @entity8 would speak of going down to @entity72 , or going down to @entity73 , or going down to @entity74 , but we would never say we had gone " down " to @entity29			0
still , i thought , he was out of the country , he was in trouble , he was undoubtedly scared , so why was i being such a stickler ? he needed my help			0
speaking of which , the subject line of the e-mail was : " help ! ! ! " @entity6 was not a guy who ever overused exclamation points			1
i drafted an e-mail back to him , apologizing for the two questions i was going to ask him			1
but i knew that there were n't many people in the world , other than the two of us , who would know the answers : 1			0
who was the makeup editor on the sports desk , with the thick glasses ? 2			0
what was the name of the restaurant next to the paper where we would sometimes eat dinner ? ( in case you 're interested : @entity109 , and @entity110 's			0
) i was about to send him the e-mail when i decided to do something first			1
i took some of the phrases from his e-mail to me and ran them through a search engine			1
they were part of a scam			1
people around the country had been receiving them ; always , the e-mails had been asking for money to be sent			1
but how could this be ? this was not some e-mail from an address i 'd never heard of , saying that a bank in @entity132 had $ 100 million waiting for me ; this was from @entity6 , from his regular e-mail address			1
was n't it ? i called his house in @entity17			0
after about four hours , it finally rang through , and he picked up			0
he was home in @entity17			0
here is what had happened : someone had electronically broken into his computer and stolen his e-mail password			1
the person had then reset the password ; @entity6 could no longer access his own e-mail account			1
the person who had stolen the password had gone through @entity6 's e-mail address book and started sending out the heartrending requests for money			1
the only way @entity6 knew about it was that some of the recipients had thought to call him			0
that 's why his phone had been busy all afternoon			0
his friends had read him the letter that had gone out using his name			0
" to me , it did n't sound like me , " @entity6 said			0
" that line about ' i 'm writing this with tears in my eyes ' -- i do n't tear up very easily			1
" he was doing his best to get in touch with his e-mail provider			1
imagine how he was feeling : someone was now , in effect , him			0
the person had access of all his saved e-mails , both ones he had received and ones he had sent			0
he was trying to remember if he had put credit card or banking information in any of the e-mails			0
it turns out ( and some of you may already know this ) that he is hardly the only victim of this scheme , both through e-mails and through social networking sites			1
law enforcement officials are well aware of it ; after speaking with @entity6 , i checked with @entity191 headquarters in @entity73			0
i was n't one sentence into reading the @entity6 e-mail to special agent @entity194 before he knew exactly what it was			1
" this is a new twist that gives these scams more credibility , " @entity194 said			0
" the way it works is that these guys remotely install malware in your computers ; you 're almost never aware they have done it			1
" one way the malware is installed , he said , is when you click on a seemingly innocuous link			1
@entity214 said that the malware lets the criminals track your keystrokes from their own computers			1
that 's how they learn your password			0
then , he said , they reset it			0
you ca n't log on to your own e-mail account anymore			2
they go through your address book and write to everyone you know			1
the people who receive the e-mails think they 're from you , that you 're in trouble and that you 're turning to them for money			2
because it 's from your e-mail address , their impulse is to help you out by sending it			1
that 's part of the scam , @entity214 said ; the thieves set up a way to have the money wired to them			1
" the best advice is not to wire money to anyone until you 're absolutely sure , " @entity194 said			2
" even if a friend is stuck overseas , there are other ways to reach you than sending an e-mail saying you should wire money			1
even if a friend 's cell phone has been stolen , there are ways to call you			2
" the problem , he said , is that friends want to help friends who are in need , and the thieves know it			2
if the friends write back asking " is this really you ? " the thieves , who control your account , send them a note assuring them that yes , the e-mail is legitimate , and say to please hurry up and send the money			1
because it 's from the familiar e-mail account , and the second note , like the first , is signed with the familiar signature , the friends believe it			2
the older e-mail scams -- the ones from odd addresses , saying that there are millions of dollars waiting for you , if you will just get in touch with this person you have never met who wants to make you wealthy -- were more analogous to unsophisticated con games			2
this newer one , though , is like breaking and entering , like home invasion ; we increasingly live on our computers , and this scheme allows the criminals to come inside			2
" i 'm still trying to get back into my account , " @entity6 said the next day when i called him again			0
the most puzzling part of it , he said -- and the part that should be a concern to the rest of us -- is : " i have absolutely no idea how they did it			0
they were out there writing to everyone i know , saying they were me , and i do n't know how they got into my computer in the first place			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity314 .			1

@entity314 gets an *urgent* e-mail from an old friend writing , " with tears in my eyes *...* "
the *desperate* plea for money turns out to be an e-mail scam
@entity314 says malware placed on computers when a user clicks on a link can capture keystrokes
thieves take over e-mail accounts and seek money from contacts in the address book
