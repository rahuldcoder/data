@entity0 -- a friend of mine who grew up in a small @entity5 town realized he was gay by age 15			1
he did not know the word but he could no longer deny that he was sexually attracted to boys , not girls			0
he had no idea what it meant and felt rather lost			0
so , he went to see a kind , elderly doctor and hesitantly asked the question			0
after a stretch of uncomfortable silence , the doctor said quietly , " take a lot of vitamin c and hopefully it 'll get better with time			0
... but most importantly , do n't ever mention this to anyone			0
" @entity22 was a criminal offense under the @entity5 , and the doctor was trying to protect his stammering teenage patient			1
when my friend told me this story many years later , we had a good laugh , agreeing that though things were n't easy for gay people in @entity33 , you did not have to stay shut in that closet for life			1
this was before disgraceful homophobic legislation was adopted in june			0
the new law bans dissemination among minors of information promoting the " attractiveness of nontraditional sexual relationships " and providing a " distorted notion of social equivalence of traditional and nontraditional sexual relationships			1
" it does not define " nontraditional " but it is widely understood to mean " homosexual			0
" and it basically means that you can not publicly say anything positive about being gay or tell a child that there is nothing wrong with being gay or being raised by gay parents			0
it seems that the @entity60 underestimated the prominence of the international lgbt rights movement and the damage the law would do to @entity33 's image , especially with the @entity66 just months away , the host country being so much in the spotlight			1
@entity33 's failure to honor the @entity71 's requirement of nondiscrimination came under scrutiny as the @entity74 continued to seek assurances that enforcement of the law would not affect the games			1
@entity33 officials at the highest level have been trying to smooth over the scandal			2
president @entity82 himself said in a recent interview that in @entity33 " people of nontraditional sexual orientation are not discriminated against " and that they are valued and equal citizens of the @entity33			1
@entity82 even noted that he was open to a discussion with @entity91 organizations			1
that 's welcome , but is he to be trusted ? as is often the case here , it 's one step forward and two steps backward			0
so far no meeting with @entity91 activists has been convened and there have been no efforts to have the heinous law repealed			1
worse , several legislators have just introduced a bill to deny parental rights to one or both parents of " nontraditional sexual orientation			0
" the main author of the bill and a member of the ruling party 's faction in the @entity112 , @entity113 , explained that the bill aims to " protect " children from psychological trauma and pertains to those parents who " do not conceal their same - sex sexual relationships			2
" the message sent to @entity91 people is clear : if you do n't want your kids taken away from you you 'd better keep your mouth shut			1
and it is particularly ironic that just days later in his much discussed @entity126 op - ed on @entity127 , @entity82 urged the @entity128 not to forget that " @entity129 created us all equal			2
" people in @entity33 would 've laughed if only things were n't getting bad enough to cry			2
when questioned about the discriminatory legislation , @entity33 officials often chide critics for exaggerating -- this is not the @entity5 , and gay people live in @entity33 freely			1
indeed , you will not be thrown behind bars for being gay			0
but the advice given to my friend by that doctor some 40 years ago has become very relevant once again : " ... do n't you ever mention this to anyone ! " in other words , if you want to have a life , do n't you dare poke your nose out of that closet			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			0

@entity153 's friend told of being gay youth in @entity5 town . doctor told him to keep it quiet
but she says in *modern* @entity33 being gay did not mean being closeted until new law passed
