-- there 's more to @entity2 than just the presidential campaign			2
the polarization of the parties has led directly to the divided and dysfunctional @entity6 we 've seen over the past two years , leading to the lowest congressional approval ratings in recent history			1
no matter who wins the presidency , we need to see more principled problem - solving centrists elected from both parties			1
that 's why i 'm continuing my pre-election @entity0 column tradition of listing some of the most standout centrist @entity19 and @entity20 candidates on the ballot this year			1
centrism is one of most misunderstood and maligned political identities in our polarized hyper - partisan environment			2
its advocates have been hunted into near - extinction on @entity28 by party - first conformists , angry ideologues and special interests			2
politics : key races to watch -- @entity19 , @entity20 and governor but a look over this list shows a deeper philosophic consistency beyond party labels -- a commitment to generational responsibility and individual liberty that can be fairly described as fiscally conservative but socially liberal			1
most of all , there is a common commitment to working together across party lines to solve problems rather than holding out for ideologically pure solutions			1
for a more detailed defense of the legitimacy of this political perspective , @entity48 gave a typically eloquent explanation of the centrist political leader as a craftsman in a must - read column			2
the 10 standout centrist candidates on this list are independents , @entity59 and @entity60 who all recognize that hyper - partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from solving the serious problems we face			1
that 's why we need them in the next @entity6 -- to break the fever of division and dysfunction , define the common ground that exists on the urgent issues we face and then build on them			1
their success in the 2012 election would be a healthy step forward for the nation			0
2012 ballot initiatives : voter - run or special interest - hijacked ? @entity79 this independent 's @entity19 campaign in @entity82 is the biggest nonpresidential race in the nation for many independent voters -- a gutsy challenge to the two parties that looks like it will prove successful			1
@entity79 has described himself as " too fiscally conservative for the @entity60 and too socially liberal for the @entity59 -- like 75 % of the @entity90 people			1
" he proved his effectiveness in two terms as a popular independent governor of @entity82 in the 1990s			0
now he is the odds - on favorite to succeed retiring centrist @entity59 @entity96 in the @entity19			1
if the @entity19 is closely divided , he could be the deciding vote			1
@entity79 has told me about his vision to bring together a coalition of senators in the vital center to break gridlock			1
" what if two or three other people like me around the country were elected who said : ' i do n't care about the parties -- i just want to solve the problems ... we 're going start talking to each other in a grown - up and civil way			1
@entity114 the @entity116 winner , @entity118 governor , senator , presidential candidate and college president would return to @entity122 as an elder statesman committed to building bipartisan coalitions			1
he is one of the most respected and best liked political leaders of recent decades			0
his opponent , social conservative state senator @entity127 , rode to victory in the @entity59 primary thanks to endorsements by the likes of @entity132 and @entity133			0
" somebody has to go back there and change @entity6			1
somebody has to stand the middle ground , " @entity114 says			1
" i want to be the person that makes that change happen			0
" this election is close in a center - right state , and former @entity144 sen. @entity144 's endorsement of @entity145 on thursday provided another boost			0
having @entity114 back in the senate would be a win not just for the people of @entity118 , but for the entire country			1
@entity151 a former congresswoman , air force officer and @entity155 , the @entity152 @entity59 would be an excellent addition to the @entity19 and the @entity59 conference			1
she won more than 40 % of the @entity160 vote in each of her six congressional races			0
but with the polarization of the @entity160 population over neighboring @entity166 's immigration laws , @entity152 has moved from bellwether swing state to the @entity60 column			0
so , @entity169 is flying against stiff headwinds			0
but she 's a big - tent , pro-life @entity59 -- fiscally conservative , centrist on social issues and strong on defense -- with a demonstrated ability to win over independent voters			2
her biggest problem is the rightward drift of the @entity59 and the consequent alienation of the @entity160 vote in a presidential year			0
but she would make a great senator that @entity152 would be proud of for decades to come			0
@entity182 the @entity183 @entity145 is running to replace centrist @entity59 statesman @entity184 in the @entity19 against the @entity186 - backed @entity59 nominee @entity185			1
a three - term congressman with a decidedly centrist record , @entity182 has been arguing that @entity185 is too extreme for @entity183 -- with plenty of help from @entity185 himself			1
from @entity185 's saying that bipartisanship " ought to consist of @entity60 coming to the @entity59 point of view , " to slamming centrists in the @entity19 by arguing that " the time for collegiality is past ... it 's time for confrontation , " to his now infamous comments that pregnancies that result from rape are " @entity206 , " @entity185 has managed to find himself losing a @entity19 race in a state that @entity194 is winning easily			1
hoosiers do n't seem to want an embarrassing advocate of extremism in the @entity19			1
they 'd do better with @entity182			1
@entity211 it takes an impressive person to win @entity215 's governorship as a @entity59 , but former @entity216 mayor @entity211 managed to distinguish herself as a successful and popular leader during her two terms , while breaking down barriers as the first woman and first @entity222 governor of the @entity215			0
running in a presidential election cycle with @entity215 - born @entity224 on the ballot is no picnic for a @entity59 , but @entity211 has overcome long odds before -- she won reelection as governor by the largest margin in @entity215 's history			0
she 's developed an impressive record as a decisive leader , combining fiscal responsibility with a big - tent approach on social issues			0
she would be a refreshing centrist @entity59 voice in the @entity19			1
@entity238 it 's a tight @entity19 race between two former @entity241 governors -- centrist @entity145 @entity238 and conservative @entity59 @entity242 -- to see who will succeed @entity244 in the @entity19			1
@entity238 is the kind of solid @entity246 @entity145 who has proven he can win statewide in the @entity249 state , like his predecessor @entity250 , who currently serves in the @entity19 and has been a leader of the @entity253 negotiations to find a bipartisan deal on the deficit and the debt			2
@entity238 -- a former @entity257 chair - is not as nonpartisan as many centrists , but he is a classic @entity259 of the kind we have seen almost hunted into extinction on @entity263			2
his election would send a welcome signal about that tradition 's persistence and further commitment to the kind of thoughtful bipartisan cooperation we need to see in the @entity19			2
@entity272 when @entity272 won the special election to succeed @entity275 in the @entity19 , it was seen as a tea party victory predicated upon his opposition to @entity224 's health care reform			1
but as senator , @entity272 has developed a decidedly centrist voting record -- being recognized by the @entity283 voting records as having a 55 % conservative and 45 % liberal composite record , placing him squarely in the center of the @entity19			1
he has tried to rekindle the @entity289 moderate tradition and is locked in a tough race against @entity291 , who has developed a strong following for her fearless work in the wake of the fiscal crisis			0
but @entity272 's record can not and should not be ignored -- and if he loses this @entity19 seat in the headwinds of the likely @entity224 landslide in his home state of @entity289 , we could see @entity272 back in the @entity19 or serve as governor sometime in the future			2
@entity304 to many moderates , @entity305 is the symbol of everything that 's wrong with our divided and dysfunctional congress			0
she 's quick to call opponents anti-american and weave unhinged conspiracy theories into policy debates			0
but she 's never had a serious candidate campaign against her until now			0
@entity304 is a 58 - year - old , self - made @entity315 businessman and grandfather of seven , still married to his high - school sweetheart			0
and he 's got @entity305 on defense in her reelection effort			0
" my policy approach transcends political lines , " @entity304 told me in an interview for @entity323 , " i 'm a centrist , a libertarian when it comes to social issues			2
i do n't think government should be involved with personal lives			0
i really believe in separation of church and state			0
@entity305 wants to blur those lines -- she would ( replace ) our democracy with a theocracy , " he says			2
" she epitomizes everything that 's wrong with @entity6 and this country -- a lack of civility , a lack of bipartisan or nonpartisan approach to problem solving			2
" @entity342 a @entity59 running for @entity6 in @entity289 this year might be dismissed as a political suicide mission , but @entity342 is an exception in every sense			2
he 's running a strong race against an uninspiring and ineffective liberal incumbent @entity348 in a state where registered independents outnumber @entity60 or @entity59			0
@entity342 is popular state legislator and a self - described " live and let live ' @entity59 -- who applies the principles of individual liberty and individual responsibility consistently in his political philosophy -- get government out of the bedroom and out of the boardroom			0
he is also , perhaps not incidentally , openly gay			0
but @entity342 's constituents have come to see him as a strong advocate of fiscal responsibility and limited government , a libertarian @entity363 @entity59 in the mold of @entity365 rather than @entity194			0
@entity366 this upstate @entity368 @entity59 congressman is an independent thinker who does not let party loyalty get in the way of his common sense approach to solving problems			2
the longtime businessman and community leader does not mince words or shy away from condemning impractical extremes on both sides			0
he told the @entity381 , " i 'm frustrated by how much we -- i mean the @entity59 -- are willing to give deferential treatment to our extremes in this moment in history			0
... if all people do is go down there and join a team , and the team is invested in winning and you have something that looks very similar to the shirts and the skins , there 's not a lot of value there			0
" that 's the kind of principled independence , and commitment to governing in the national interest , that we need to see more of in the next @entity6			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity407 .			2

@entity407 : we need to see more principled centrists elected to @entity6
@entity407 : i offer a list of the top standout centrist @entity19 and @entity6 candidates
his *suggestions* *include* @entity79 , @entity114 , @entity151 , @entity182 and others
@entity407 : centrism is about working together across party lines to solve problems
