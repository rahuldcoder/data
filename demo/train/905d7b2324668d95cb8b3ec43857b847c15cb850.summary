-- @entity2 co-founder and @entity4 founding president @entity1 lashed out at the movie " @entity6 " at a conference in @entity8 sunday , calling it " a complete work of fiction			1
" as you can see in this video ( skip to 5:20 ) , @entity1 admires the production values of the film , but objects to the way his character was portrayed			1
he particularly dislikes the scene where he writes a check to @entity4 co-founder @entity20 : " the part of the movie that frustrated me is actually the scene at the end where the character played by @entity26 -- who happens to have my name -- basically writes a check to @entity20 -- who i 'm also , i consider @entity20 a friend of mine , and i 'm one of the few people at @entity4 who still interacts with @entity20 -- and throws it in his face and has security escort him out of the building			2
" and i mean , that 's just rude			0
this guy in the movie is a morally reprehensible human being			0
" @entity1 made the remarks in an on - stage interview at the @entity42 2011 in @entity43 , which started sunday			0
in an interview with @entity0 three months ago , @entity44 would n't say whether he liked the film or not , but thought its audience size was minuscule compared with @entity4 's : " we build products that 500 million people see ... if 5 million people see a movie , it does n't really matter that much			2
