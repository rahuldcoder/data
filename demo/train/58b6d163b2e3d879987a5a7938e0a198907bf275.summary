@entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 -- " this has been voted one of the best left - hand breaks on the planet			1
but watch out for the reef if you get dumped -- try and shallow fall			2
" the surfing instructor knows who he 's dealing with -- an uncoordinated , naturally ungifted sportsman on the wrong side of fit and very embarrassed at being @entity14 yet unable to surf			1
and totally in awe of the view back to the beach and surrounding coastline while floating impressively ungainly between wave sets			2
a scene like this , of the beach , gardens and hillside of the unassuming @entity4 resort on @entity6 's eastern island of @entity5 , makes a morning of shallow falling ( read : tumbling like a drunken cat in a washing machine ) totally palatable			1
the beauty is immense and the urge to dole out " paradise " - riddled cliches is equally immense			2
yet , there 's something more tranquil about this setting , a sense of harmony in the way the resort blends in effortlessly with its surroundings -- even with this surfer wannabe in the frame			1
finding the ' perfect place ' the hotel is the remarkable result of a vision of colorful resort founder @entity47 , who in 1984 with his wife , @entity48 , packed up their life in @entity51 to go in search of the perfect wave			1
the ambition , he says , was to create a " perfect place " around that perfect experience			2
it has so far proven a story well worth retelling			2
" i wanted to create something totally experiential that did n't detract from the area , " says @entity61			2
" the best travel is around the best experiences			2
" after four years , and finding what has become known locally as @entity68 , he and @entity48 ended up here in @entity4 on the southern coast of the relatively unknown @entity5 , an island about an hour 's flight east of @entity72			1
land time almost forgot the couple camped on the beach , an idyllic 2.5 - kilometer - long stretch of sand			2
the beach is still difficult to access for anyone other than local villagers , and thus serves as something of a private beach for guests			1
it 's hard to imagine this same sand was the scene , barely six months before the @entity47 ' arrival , of a massive battle between 2,000 local tribesmen			1
indeed , @entity5 could be easily labeled an island that time almost forgot			0
that clash was an illustration of the fiercely traditional , territorial and tribal nature of @entity95 culture -- reinforced by the swords the village men strap to their sides to this day			0
it 's also , by @entity101 standards , incredibly poor with little to no utilities access and infrastructure for many , if not most , villages			0
this lack of standard resources posed a challenge for @entity61 and his plans			0
becoming @entity95 through years of assimilation , negotiation , trust and countless pig sacrifices , @entity47 ingrained himself with the local community			1
" we always said that if we found and developed a place , it had to be inclusive , " says @entity47 , who confesses to not being a " hotel man			1
" " tourism has the best potential economically in @entity5 but if locals are not connected to it , it will be a big disaster			0
" we could n't imagine building a hotel here without including the locals so that all would benefit			1
" @entity47 began building what became the only resort on the island -- training and employing locals from various tribes and encouraging inter-tribal marriages , to assist in easing tensions			1
the hotel soft opened in 2001 and had its first full year in 2005			1
@entity137 to protect the highly regarded surf spot from the overuse and abuse displayed in places like @entity72 , @entity47 restricted the number of surfers allowed at the hotel at any one time			1
he eventually acquired around 600 acres but developed only a small portion of that , impacting as little of the environment as he could			0
the @entity149 quickly , the location became something of a surf icon , attracting to this day those chasing that perfect wave			1
a natural reef provides a clean , rolling break			0
it also drew @entity158 , a @entity159 businessman who was so taken by the location , the people of @entity5 and their needs , that he established the @entity149 with @entity47 in 2001			1
the foundation now impacts and supports around 120 square miles around the hotel and has directly reduced malaria infection rates by 85 % in the 400 - plus villages in that area			1
there are now five health clinics as well as malnutrition programs in the area , created from some of the approximate $ 5 million donated to the foundation so far			0
the foundation supports several schools and has built more than 60 water wells and around 250 water stations			1
the latter has been key in helping to empower communities , says @entity181 , the on - the - ground manager and part of a team of around three dozen full - time @entity149 staff			1
" now people do n't have to spend their whole day traveling to fetch water			0
instead , children for instance can go to school and learn , " @entity181 says			0
the @entity149 is independent financially from the hotel , but draws on donations from @entity4 guests , the wealthier of which account for a high percentage of donations and thus impact directly the tens of thousands of locals the foundation supports			1
" more and more these days people want to have a purpose with traveling			0
it 's not enough where people go and lie down on the beach and have a drink , " says dr @entity199 , the foundation 's health program director			0
" you ca n't just come and enjoy the beauty of the place without giving back			0
so i think it really works extremely well between the hotel , the foundation and what we do			1
" due to its association with the foundation and integration with the environment and local communities and customs , the hotel has won a raft of responsible and sustainable tourism awards			1
@entity47 hopes his model is transferable elsewhere			0
" places like this that are leading the way will influence older hotels and sections of the industry			0
people will say i am not going to that hotel and instead go to where they feel their money is being well spent , " @entity47 says			2
the hotel is the largest employer on the island with around 300 full - time @entity239 staff plus 150 daily workers -- making up more than 90 % of its total workforce			2
@entity243 is among the original employees			0
for him the experience at @entity4 -- from a daily worker to gardener to restaurant waiter -- is easily summed up			1
" i want to die here , " the father of three boys and three girls told @entity7 during a visit to @entity5 last year			0
" in @entity5 it is difficult to find a job			0
it has helped a lot of local people find work			2
" i can send my brothers and sisters and children to university or other parts of @entity6 now			1
" more than surfing the hotel has 22 exceptional open - plan villas , designed to be low impact , drawing on @entity47 ' philosophy and vision of integration by utilizing local designs , materials and construction techniques			1
experiences for @entity4 guests can include trips to nearby villages and clinics or programs the @entity149 runs or supports			1
" you can go into the villages , you can experience daily life , you can go to the markets and you can contribute if you want			0
and most do because they want to and it 's not a tough sell			0
they really want to be a part of it and they really want to keep coming back to see the good work they 've done , " says @entity287 , managing partner at @entity4			1
@entity68 remains the most famous draw card , luring surfers from the world over , and limits itself to 10 surfers at the break per day			2
another 10 villas are due to be completed by march 2015 -- part of a plan to host those keen on more than just surfing			0
indeed , for those like this writer , not able to ride a board , there 's a lot more to @entity4 than surfing			1
the range of activities available includes a full range of spa options , waterfall hikes , biking , scuba diving and snorkeling , yoga , day trips and horseback riding			0
a stand up paddleboard trip to nearby @entity321 river is thoroughly recommended , but be warned of smiling local kids who dive bomb paddlers at every opportunity			2
@entity47 recently stepped back from his role at the hotel , selling it to new owner @entity328 , who has partnered with shareholder and established hotel manager , @entity331			2
@entity47 is in and out of @entity5 and still focused on the @entity149 now that there are a regular batch of guests that keep returning -- many of them keen to see the continued progress their support for the foundation has made			1
" we 've proven that if you get it right , guests will come back			0
guests get involved and it is beneficial for all , " @entity47 says			0
and this guest just might even be able to surf next time around			2
