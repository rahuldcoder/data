the wife of an accused @entity2 operative captured by @entity4 forces told @entity5 that masked men ambushed her husband when he was on the way home from morning prayers			1
while @entity4 defense secretary @entity13 called @entity14 " one of the world 's most wanted terrorists , " @entity12 's wife described him a different way in an exclusive interview with @entity5 on sunday			1
@entity20 called @entity12 an innocent man , adding that he left @entity2 in 1996 and had no connection to the twin 1998 bombings at @entity4 embassies in @entity25 and @entity26			1
" i am sure of what i am saying -- he did not take part in any bombing anywhere in the world , " @entity27 said			2
" he participated in the jihad in @entity33			0
he was a member of @entity2 and he was personal security for ( @entity35 ) @entity35 -- that 's true -- but he did not take part in any operation			1
" @entity39 was among those indicted for the embassy attacks by a federal grand jury in @entity43 , and @entity4 officials and terrorism analysts hailed news of his capture			1
meanwhile , @entity49 's interim government distanced itself from the operation and called the @entity4 capture a kidnapping			1
@entity27 told @entity5 she did n't know who had taken her husband -- only that the raid she watched happen from her @entity58 home happened very quickly			2
@entity39 was returning to his house at about 6:30 a.m. saturday ( 12:30 a.m. et ) when a group of at least 10 men in four vehicles surprised him , his wife told @entity5			1
some of the men were wearing masks , while others were n't , she said			2
those men looked like @entity49 to her and they spoke @entity68 with @entity49 accents , she said			1
" what i saw were @entity49			1
maybe they had @entity4 with them , but i did n't see them because there was more than one car			1
they say there were 10 people involved , but i believe there were more than 10 , " @entity27 said			0
" i could n't count them because there were many of them			0
i ca n't confirm if they were @entity4 or not , but what i saw were @entity49			1
" elite team involved in capture on sunday , a @entity4 official said commandos from the elite @entity4 army @entity86 had snatched the 49 - year - old @entity2 operative			1
@entity58 has requested an explanation from @entity91 about the raid , the country 's state news agency reported sunday			2
the mission was conducted with the knowledge of the @entity49 government , said one @entity4 official			1
the @entity97 said the @entity4 military was holding @entity12 in a " secure location " outside @entity49			1
a @entity4 official told @entity5 that he was taken to a @entity102 warship after his capture			1
@entity4 forces strike in @entity49 , @entity105 , capture @entity2 operative " it 's a masterpiece how someone can craft such an operation , " said @entity49 counterterrorism analyst @entity107 , who is also a former jihadist associate of @entity108			1
@entity107 is president of the @entity112 , a @entity114 - based counterterrorism think tank			2
he is also a former senior member of the @entity115 , which @entity12 joined in the mid- 1990s before gravitating back toward @entity2			0
@entity39 had been living in that still unsettled nation , more or less in the open , for more than a year despite his alleged associations			2
according to @entity107 , it is unlikely he was still playing an active role for @entity2			2
his wife agreed , saying he was living a normal life , was not in hiding and had reapplied for a job with the oil ministry			2
she said he has a severe case of hepatitis c and she worries about his health			0
next stop , @entity43 ? @entity39 has been all around the globe -- @entity33 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity25 , @entity131 , @entity132 and beyond -- making friends with some of the world 's most notorious terrorists and enemies with the @entity4 and its allies			1
on saturday , his odyssey ended where it began : in his homeland of @entity49			2
his next destination ? he eventually will be taken to @entity43 , a source with knowledge of the capture and proceedings told @entity5 , though the exact timing is unclear			0
the @entity150 administration has activated the @entity151 to interview him for intelligence purposes while he remains in @entity4 military custody , @entity4 officials told @entity5			2
the team is led by the @entity155 and includes @entity156 and other intelligence agencies			0
after the interviews are concluded , he would be transferred to civilian custody and brought to @entity43 to face federal charges , the officials said			0
@entity4 authorities have long wanted @entity12 to stand trial in an @entity4 court to face charges for his alleged role in the @entity4 embassy bombings that left well over 200 dead and thousands wounded			1
@entity169 lost both her father , @entity171 , and her brother , @entity173 , in the attack in @entity175 , @entity25			0
her father was the @entity4 @entity177 's counsel general ; her 20 - year - old brother was an intern there			1
" we know that this is a firm signal around the globe that as our government is still wading through a standstill right now , that we are still vigilant as a country and focused on international terror , and we 're not going to step down at all , " @entity169 told @entity5 's " new day sunday			0
" @entity169 said while she was relieved when @entity35 -- also indicted in the embassy attacks -- was killed in 2011 , she 's also happy that @entity12 was taken into custody			2
" certainly , we are very pleased to know that we can have someone who is captured , and for the wealth of information that may be available to our intelligence community and our military personnel , " she said			0
" you ca n't put a price on that			0
" @entity5 's @entity195 , a veteran of covering @entity2 , said @entity12 's arrest is a " huge deal			0
" " he 's a big player in @entity2 ( and ) in one of the key target areas , in the north of @entity201 , " he said			1
" this is a significant step			0
" stops in @entity33 , @entity131 , @entity132 and beyond the @entity155 's page on @entity12 -- part of its roster of " @entity208 " and noting the $ 5 million reward being offered for information leading directly to his apprehension -- says that he is accused in a " conspiracy to kill @entity4 nationals , to murder , to destroy buildings and property of the @entity4 , and to destroy the national defense utilities of the @entity4			1
" born @entity218 , @entity12 joined @entity2 soon after its founding , as the terrorist organization built up its presence in @entity33 and @entity129			0
when the group 's late leader @entity35 relocated to @entity224 , @entity130 , in 1992 , @entity12 went with him			0
as the 1990s continued , @entity12 came to be known as one of @entity2 's most capable operatives , especially for his expertise in surveillance and computers			0
a fellow @entity2 operative at one point testified that @entity12 was in @entity175 in 1993 , allegedly checking out possible targets , including the @entity4 embassy			1
the blast in @entity25 's capital five years later ended up killing more than 200 people and wounding 5,000			0
the @entity26 blast went off nearly simultaneously , leaving 11 people dead			0
his wife denied that he had any role in any bombing and said that after he returned to @entity49 in 2011 during the revolution , he had been asking the @entity49 government to help him clear his name			1
she did admit that he had belonged to @entity2 , but said he was a personal guard for @entity35 until he left the terror group in 1996			0
@entity201 marks 10th anniversary of @entity4 embassy bombings @entity39 at one point joined the jihadist @entity250 before moving to @entity251 and then @entity131 , settling in @entity252			1
it was there , in 2000 , that police raided his home			0
authorities uncovered a document that became known as the " @entity259 " -- hundreds of pages of guidance on carrying out a terrorist campaign			0
among them : a document that called for " attacking , blasting and destroying " embassies			0
but what they did n't find was @entity12 , who had left the country before the raid			0
he is thought to have spent time subsequently in @entity33 before fleeing to @entity132 after the fall of the @entity272			0
western intelligence sources believe he remained in that country before going home to @entity49			2
after years in native @entity49 , @entity12 in @entity4 hands in september 2012 , @entity5 was first to report that @entity12 was alive and well in @entity49			1
western intelligence had tracked his movements in @entity58 , and had even taken surveillance photos			0
western intelligence sources said that there was concern that @entity12 was working to establish an @entity2 network in the @entity284 nation , but no evidence has since materialized that he continued to be involved in terrorist operations after he returned to @entity49			2
so how long had he been home ? in december 2010 , before the outbreak of the unrest that ended with @entity292 's death , @entity49 authorities told a @entity294 committee that @entity12 had returned , even giving a @entity58 address for him			1
and one @entity297 intelligence source said @entity12 appears to have been in @entity49 in the spring of 2011 , when the civil war was in full swing			2
family members told @entity301 returned to @entity58 in 2011 to take part in the revolution against @entity292			0
his wife , four sons and daughter had arrived from @entity132 the previous year			0
@entity308 's sons and wife say they believed they were under surveillance over the past two years in @entity49 and expected anything -- even a drone strike			1
but saturday 's raid still came as a surprise			2
" there was no longer any talk about him in the media , so we felt somewhat reassured			0
he even stopped taking his weapon or his sons with him or hiring private security -- he was living his life normally , " @entity27 said			0
counterterrorism analysts told @entity5 in fall 2012 that @entity12 may not have been apprehended at the time because of the delicate security situation in much of @entity49 , where ex-jihadists -- especially those who once belonged to the @entity250 -- held considerable sway after the campaign against and ultimate ouster of longtime leader @entity292			1
it was not clear for how long , and how much , @entity49 's government knew about @entity12 's presence , or whether other governments had approached them to arrest @entity12			1
the fact that there 's no extradition treaty between @entity49 and the @entity4 further complicates matters			1
the fact that @entity12 is in @entity4 hands , of course , changes everything			2
in addition to standing trial , @entity12 will be questioned about what he knows about @entity2 and other terrorist organizations			0
and if he talks , he could offer valuable information on men he worked with inside @entity49 , as well as @entity2 generally			1
" all his recent years of activation is going to come under very , very close and important scrutiny , " said @entity5 's @entity195 .			0

official : commandos from the elite @entity4 army @entity86 conducted the raid
@entity14 's wife says some of the men in the raid seemed to be @entity49
the operation was a " masterpiece , " @entity49 counterterrorism analyst says
@entity39 is *suspected* of playing a part in 2 @entity4 embassy bombings in @entity201 in 1998
