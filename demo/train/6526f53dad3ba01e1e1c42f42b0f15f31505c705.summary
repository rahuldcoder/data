@entity0 -- @entity2 came the pain -- a decade of torture , torment and terror for three captive women and one of their young daughters			0
now comes the prosecution and -- if there 's a conviction -- punishment for the man accused of being responsible for their hell			2
@entity17 appeared silently in court thursday , his head down , as he was arraigned on four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape , accused of holding the women captive in his @entity0 home			1
@entity28 judge @entity27 ordered @entity17 held on $ 8 million bond -- $ 2 million for each of the three women and the child born to @entity17 before they were freed monday evening			1
hours later , the top prosecutor in @entity34 , @entity35 , announced he 'd press for more charges -- " for each and every act of sexual violence ... each day of kidnapping , every felonious assault ( and ) all his attempted murders			1
" furthermore , prosecutor @entity41 said he 'd try to persuade a grand jury to indict the 52 - year - old @entity17 for " aggravated murder " for the termination of his captives ' pregnancies			1
he cited a state law that a person can be charged with murder -- a conviction that could lead to the death penalty in @entity35 -- for killing unborn children			1
@entity53 : ' we do n't have monster in our blood ' according to an initial incident report obtained by @entity1 , @entity17 said she became pregnant at least five times while in @entity17 's 1,400 - square - foot home			1
when that happened , she told investigators , @entity17 " starved her for at least two weeks , then he repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried			1
" it is not known how many times , if any , the other two women got pregnant only to miscarry			0
one of them , @entity69 , gave birth to a daughter while in captivity			2
that 's just one of the brutal tales reported so far about the women 's captivity , which @entity41 described as " beyond comprehension			2
" " the child kidnapper operated a torture chamber and private prison in the heart of the city , " he told reporters			0
" the horrific brutality and torture that the victims endured for a decade is beyond comprehension			0
" @entity17 's own mother is among those trying to make sense of the horror			1
" i have a sick son who has done something serious , " she told @entity95 and @entity96			1
" i 'm suffering very much			2
i ask for forgiveness from those mothers ; may those girls forgive me			0
" source : writings detail actions , reasons behind them so what was going through the suspect 's mind , when he allegedly lured three women into a car between 2002 and 2004 , took them to his home three miles away and held them there -- where they were chained , threatened and repeatedly sexually assaulted ? neither @entity17 , his attorneys nor police have spelled out a motive publicly			1
the suspect has talked with investigators , confessing to some of the actions of which he 's accused , said a law enforcement source closely involved with the investigation			2
the source did not describe precisely what @entity17 confessed to when he was interrogated			1
plus , investigators have asked the state crime lab to expedite tests to create a dna profile of @entity17 -- something that typically takes 20 days , but should be back friday -- said @entity35 attorney general 's office spokesman @entity129			1
they 're also poring over evidence , including more than 200 items seized from @entity17 's @entity134 home			1
among them are writings authorities believe were written by the suspect , said two law enforcement sources closely involved in the case			0
those contain " specific detailing of actions and reasons behind actions " tied to the women 's abduction and their kidnapper 's behavior toward them , one of the law enforcement sources said			2
the author cites his own history of abuse by family members as justification			0
the latest developments in the @entity0 case the source -- who described the " pretty lengthy " writings as " more of a diary " -- said they included talk of suicide , though that 's just one of many aspects			2
authorities are working " meticulously " to see whether others were involved in the kidnapping plot			2
two of @entity17 's brothers , @entity170 and @entity172 , were initially arrested in the case only to be released thursday -- after appearing in court on unrelated cases -- when investigators found nothing , including from the victims ' interviews , linking them to the abductions			1
one of his daughters , @entity182 , told @entity1 that she " just wanted to die " upon hearing her father had been implicated			0
but looking back , she thinks there were signs of something awry -- such as how her father " kept his house locked down so tight " and would sometimes leave mysteriously for an hour or so , then return , with " no explanation			0
" " everything 's making sense now , " @entity191 said			2
" it 's all adding up , and i 'm just disgusted			1
" source : death threat if newborn died according to the initial incident report , the women said @entity17 first chained them in the basement but later let them live upstairs on the second floor			1
the women went outside only twice during their ordeal -- and just " briefly " at that , @entity0 public safety director @entity202 said			0
most of the time the three would be in different rooms , though they interacted occasionally and came to " rely on each other for survival , " said a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation			0
one thing they could count on was that their alleged captor would n't let them out			0
@entity17 would often test his captives by pretending to leave , the law enforcement source said			1
then he 'd suddenly return ; if there were indications any of the women had moved , they 'd be disciplined			0
survival the key difference from ' @entity225 ' case while @entity17 told investigators @entity17 forced her to miscarry her own unborn children , she said he ordered her to deliver @entity69 's child , according to a police source familiar with the investigation			1
the baby was delivered in a plastic tub or pool in order to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid , the source said			0
the child stopped breathing , and everyone started screaming , the source said , citing accounts by the young women			0
@entity17 said @entity17 threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive , the initial police report states			1
" what 's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6 - year - old , " the source said			2
' i do n't think she would have lived very much longer ' @entity17 remained hospitalized in good condition thursday , said @entity258 spokeswoman @entity257			1
the others held -- @entity69 , her 6 - year - old daughter and @entity17 -- are back with relatives			1
@entity263 specialists who talked with them feel they " desperately need space and time , " said @entity41			0
who are @entity69 , @entity17 and @entity17 ? " these victims need to be decompressed , " he said			1
" they need a chance to heal before we seek further in - depth evidence from them			2
" those close to them , as well as residents of @entity0 and beyond , are trying to make sense of the alleged depravity			0
one of them is @entity277 , the suspect 's daughter and once a very good friend of @entity17			1
she was interviewed on an " @entity283 " segment in 2005 talking about how she 'd been with @entity17 , hoping to spend the afternoon with her , shortly before her abduction			1
speaking thursday on @entity285 's " @entity284 , " she said she last spoke with her father late last month , adding the two had never been close			2
whatever their relationship , she insisted , " i had no idea " what was happening			0
" i 'm really disappointed , embarrassed , mainly devastated , " @entity277 said			0
" ... i would like to say that i 'm absolutely so , so sorry			0
" women crushed by news her father allegedly abducted her friend @entity296 said on @entity1 's " @entity297 " thursday that hearing @entity69 , her granddaughter , was alive 10 years after her disappearance was the " most important thing that ever happened in my life			0
" @entity303 , who spoke to @entity69 by phone from her @entity306 home tuesday , said she 's grateful for all involved in the case -- from police to helpful neighbors -- and that her granddaughter can now live her life			0
" if she had n't got out , i do n't think she would have lived very much longer , " @entity303 said			0
timeline : from missing to liberated @entity1 's @entity314 reported from @entity0 , and @entity1 's @entity315 reported and wrote from @entity316			0
@entity1 's @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 and @entity326 contributed to this report .			0
