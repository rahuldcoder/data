@entity0 -- @entity5 founder @entity4 is " in the process of making arrangements " to meet with @entity9 police regarding a @entity11 arrest warrant , his attorney said monday			1
@entity4 is wanted for questioning by @entity11 authorities over sex - crime allegations unrelated to @entity5 ' recent disclosure of secret @entity16 documents			1
@entity17 , his @entity9 lawyer , told the @entity18 no time had been set for the meeting as of monday evening , but one is likely " in the foreseeable future			1
" " we are in the process of making arrangements to meet with the police by consent in order to facilitate the taking of that question - and - answer as needed , " @entity17 said			0
@entity4 , a 39 - year - old @entity29 , has said he has long feared retribution for his website 's disclosures and has called the rape allegations against him a smear campaign			1
@entity11 issued an arrest warrant for @entity4 in november , saying he is suspected of rape , sexual molestation and illegal use of force			2
the warrant was followed last week by a " @entity42 " from @entity43 , placing @entity4 on a list of wanted suspects at the request of @entity11 's @entity47			1
@entity9 police then asked @entity11 authorities for additional details not specified in the initial arrest warrant , a possible indication that the location of the elusive @entity4 is known			1
@entity1 has not confirmed that @entity4 is in the @entity9			2
@entity11 prosecutors said monday that they had sent additional information the @entity9 requested and that the case was being handled in accordance with @entity59 laws			0
@entity5 , which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information , has been under intense pressure from the @entity16 and its allies since it began posting the first of more than 250,000 @entity66 documents november 28			1
since then , the site has been hit with denial - of - service attacks , been kicked off servers in the @entity16 and @entity70 and found itself cut off from funds in the @entity16 and @entity73			1
in response , the site has rallied supporters to mirror its content " in order to make it impossible to ever fully remove @entity5 from the internet , " with more than 500 sites responding to the appeal by monday evening , it said			2
supporters have rallied on the microblogging site @entity85 as well			0
@entity86 , a software designer in suburban @entity87 , said government efforts to squelch @entity5 risk a backlash among younger , tech - savvy @entity16			1
she called government efforts to shut down the site " embarrassing			2
" " now that the information has already been leaked , it becomes more of a free - speech issue , " @entity92 said			0
most reviews of the documents have failed to turn up many surprises so far , she said -- " that 's why i feel like the censorship is a bigger issue			0
" in addition , @entity5 has posted a massive , closely encrypted file , identified as " insurance " -- a file @entity4 's lawyer has described as a " thermonuclear device			1
" @entity4 has said the more than 100,000 people who have downloaded the file will receive the key to decoding it should anything happen to him or should the site be taken down			2
@entity111 , a former @entity112 analyst , said the file is nearly impossible to decode without the key			0
" if you do n't have the password , there are trillions of potential options of recovering the data , " he said			0
" you have to go through trillions and trillions and trillions of options to actually get the right sequence of characters back			0
so that 's why the password is so important			0
" but in @entity129 , @entity16 attorney general @entity128 said he has authorized " significant " actions related to a criminal investigation of @entity5			1
" national security of the @entity16 has been put at risk , " @entity128 said			2
" the lives of people who work for the @entity16 people have been put at risk			2
the @entity16 people themselves have been put at risk by these actions that i believe are arrogant , misguided and ultimately not helpful in any way			2
we are doing everything that we can			0
" @entity128 declined to answer questions about the possibility that the @entity16 government could shut down @entity5 , saying he does not want to talk about capabilities and techniques at the government 's disposal			1
nor would he say whether the actions involved search warrants , requests under the @entity155 , which authorizes wiretaps or other means , describing them only as " significant			0
" " i authorized just last week a number of things to be done so that we can , hopefully , get to the bottom of this and hold people accountable as they should be , " he said			0
in @entity73 , meanwhile , @entity5 said in a press release that the bank @entity164 decided to end " its business relationship " with @entity4 based on a " technicality			1
" the bank said @entity4 listed @entity167 as his home and " upon inspection , this information was found to be incorrect			0
" " @entity4 can not provide proof of residence in @entity73 and thus does not meet the criteria for a customer relationship with @entity164 , " the bank said			0
@entity5 ' statement said @entity4 used his lawyer 's address in @entity167 for bank correspondence			1
the account closure -- coupled with the decision by @entity16 - based website @entity182 to cut off online donations to @entity5 last week -- has resulted in losses of 100,000 euros ( @entity16 $ 133,000 ) in assets , @entity5 said			1
and in @entity4 's native @entity29 , meanwhile , prime minister @entity186 told reporters tuesday that police were investigating whether any of her country 's laws were broken			1
but she @entity5 was " grossly irresponsible " to have distributed the documents , which a @entity16 soldier based in @entity193 is suspected of providing to them			1
" i 've been asked about this matter a number of times , and i want to be clear about my attitude to it , " she said			0
publishing the documents " is an illegal act that certainly breached the laws of the @entity16			0
the individual involved , there are potential matters arising from @entity11 and the warrant there , " she added			0
@entity1 's @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this report .			0
