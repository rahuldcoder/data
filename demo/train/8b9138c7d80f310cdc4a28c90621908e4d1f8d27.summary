see photos of @entity41 in @entity5 » @entity0 : what areas are good for nightlife ? @entity21 : there are two options : @entity91 has glitzy clubs and fancy restaurants			1
party people might typically start their evening at the " little bar " at @entity96 , which has good djs and attracts an arty crowd , then shift to @entity99 at midnight for flirting and dancing , and if they know the doorman or are feeling lucky , party in the early hours at celebrity hot - spot @entity103			1
there 's also an area on the south side , mainly up on @entity108			0
it 's funkier , a little more bohemian and a little more mellow , with clubs and music venues			0
you have to trudge up a steep cobble - stone street to get to the top of @entity108 , but it 's worth the climb			2
the view of the city at night is amazing and there are some cool nightspots			2
one of them is @entity122 ( which means bowling hall )			0
