fast food workers striking for higher wages in seven cities monday are bound to be disappointed			1
on their last week before vacation , @entity3 is n't likely to raise the minimum wage			1
they 're not even close to critical mass on that issue			0
with other issues on their plate -- immigration reform , the farm bill and that whole business about funding the government -- it is not one of the things lawmakers are spending a lot of time talking about			0
there are n't any votes scheduled any time soon and it has n't yet had a hearing in the @entity23 this year			0
but there does seem to be a confluence of minimum wage story lines , in addition to the fast food walkout , across the nation recently			1
related : fast food workers protest in seven cities in a major speech last week , president @entity32 renewed his call to up the current $ 7.25 minimum wage for wage earners who do n't get tips to $ 9.00 per hour			1
the minimum wage section was an applause line when he spruced up his economic plan with the first in a series of speeches he plans to give outside of @entity46			1
" because no one who works full - time in @entity48 should have to live in poverty , i am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage -- because it 's lower right now than it was when @entity55 took office			1
it 's time for the minimum wage to go up , " he said during his speech at @entity58 in central @entity59			1
he also called for a minimum wage increase in more detail during his @entity65 address earlier this year			1
" this single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families , " he said			0
" it could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank ; rent or eviction ; scraping by or finally getting ahead			0
for businesses across the country , it would mean customers with more money in their pockets			0
and a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government			0
in fact , working folks should n't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while ceo pay has never been higher			1
" in @entity46 , the @entity91 passed a bill this month that would force large retailers -- specifically , @entity94 -- to pay a wage of more than $ 12.00			2
that 's a higher hourly rate than some @entity46 city workers get			2
supporters of the bill counter that city workers get benefits that bring their compensation above $ 12.50 -- not everyone at @entity94 does			2
there 's still no word on when that bill will head to @entity46 mayor @entity107 for his expected veto			0
related : @entity94 vs. @entity46 lawmakers the current federally - mandated minimum wage is $ 7.25 -- the same as it has been for the past four years			1
a family with children living on one or even two full - time minimum wage salaries could still fall below the federal poverty line , depending on the cost of living in their hometown			1
in recent years there has been a push for the minimum wage to be a " living " wage			2
that would require a drastic uptick , however			0
according to a " living wage " calculator from @entity125 , a " living wage " for an adult and a child in @entity129 , @entity130 , for instance , would be $ 17.56 , if you factor in child care			2
for two adults and no children , they suggest a living wage of $ 16.20 per hour if there were no child care expenses			2
every @entity141 and six @entity142 in the @entity23 voted against raising the minimum wage when @entity142 offered it during a procedural fight over an unrelated bill in march			2
that vote was 223 - 184			0
the federal rate has only been raised a few times in recent decades , most recently in 2007 , soon after @entity142 took control of the @entity23			0
they lost control of the @entity23 in 2010			0
the third and final in a series bumps from that legislation kicked in in 2009			0
those who support increasing the minimum wage want to tie it to inflation and initiate automatic cost of living adjustments at periodic intervals			1
as it stands , only @entity3 can raise the minimum wage			1
and those efforts traditionally take a long time			0
it took 10 years between a 1997 wage hike and the one enacted in 2007			2
states and cities , meanwhile , have worked on their own solutions			0
they 've tied minimum wage to inflation in two states including @entity172 , where the rate is approaching $ 9			1
some cities are even higher			0
the minimum wage in high - cost @entity176 is $ 10.55			1
eighteen states and the @entity46 have a minimum wage higher than the federal level of $ 7.25 , according to the @entity180			1
there is evidence on both sides of the minimum wage debate			2
proponents of an increase say it is an important safeguard for low - wage workers and evidence shows it does not lead to higher unemployment			0
but opponents suggest is has other effects on the jobs market			0
raising the minimum wage " makes it harder for unskilled workers to gain the labor market experience and on - the - job training that would raise their productivity and future pay , " wrote the economist @entity193 , of @entity194 and a professor at @entity196 recently			1
" unskilled workers are less attractive with a higher minimum wage because they produce less per hour and their hiring diverts more senior workers from revenue producing activities to training and supervision			1
" according to a recent @entity213 report on @entity215 data , minimum wage jobs are on the decline			2
an estimated 3.6 million people were paid hourly rates at or below the federal minimum in 2012			0
nearly 60 % of @entity48 workers are paid hourly , according to the @entity48 @entity215			0
an estimated 4.7 % of those hourly workers make minimum wage or less , down from 5.2 % , a year earlier -- the lowest rate since 2008 .			1

little chance @entity3 with take up increasing the minimum wage any time soon
@entity32 has said he wants to raise rate from $ *7.25/hour* to $ *9.00/hour* .
