on april 26 , 1986 , the @entity1 's reactor @entity0 blew up after a cooling capability test , and the resulting nuclear fire lasted 10 days , spewing 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on @entity6			1
to date , it 's the world 's worst nuclear accident			1
the 2011 @entity11 meltdown , of course , is still playing out -- but actually , so is @entity1			1
nearly 28 years after the disaster , reactor no. 4 simmers under its " sarcophagus , " a concrete and metal cover hastily built after the accident			2
it 's now cracked , rusted and leaking radiation			1
a partial roof collapse last february sent reverberations of fear throughout the world			2
as well it should have			2
with 200 tons of lava - like radioactive material still below the reactor , and the " @entity27 " aimed at containing and protecting it not scheduled for completion till 2015 ( already 15 years overdue ) this story of nuclear disaster is in its early chapters			0
today , @entity1 's soil , water , and air are among the most highly contaminated on @entity37			1
the reactor sits at the center of a 1,000 - square - mile " @entity40 , " a quarantined no - man 's land complete with border guards , passport control and radiation monitoring			1
inside the @entity40 are hundreds of unmarked ( and un-mapped ) burial sites where machinery from the cleanup after the 1986 accident was dumped			0
these days , @entity50 's four other nuclear power plants also dispose of their spent fuel inside the @entity40			1
it 's real , and it 's scary			1
@entity54 : the deadly genius of drug cartels but amidst the complicated real - life calculations and compromises -- where science and politics meet to duke out the viability of nuclear energy -- the long , deep , human parable of @entity1 is often lost			1
that story is partly embodied in an unlikely community of some 130 people , called " self - settlers " who , today , live inside the @entity69			1
almost all of them are women , the men having died off due to overuse of alcohol and cigarettes , if not the effects of elevated radiation			0
about 116,000 people were evacuated from the @entity40 at the time of the accident			0
some 1,200 of them did not accept that fate			1
of that group , the remaining women , now in their 70s and 80s , are the last survivors of a group that defied authorities -- and it would seem , common sense -- and illegally returned to their ancestral homes shortly after the accident			0
i 've been filming and interviewing this unlikely community since 2010			0
the @entity93 's scattered ghost villages are silent and bucolic , eerie and contaminated			1
many villages were bulldozed after the accident , others remain -- silent vestiges to the tragedy , and home to the ubiquitous wild boar			1
still , other villages have 1 or 2 or 8 or 12 babushkas , or babas -- the @entity105 and @entity106 words for " grandmother " -- living in them			0
one self - settler , @entity109 , told me how she snuck through the bushes back to her village in the summer of 1986			1
" shoot us and dig the grave , " she told the soldiers who nabbed her and other family members , " otherwise we 're staying			0
" then she handed me a chunk of warm salo --- raw fat -- from her just - slaughtered pig			0
@entity54 : what i discovered in @entity122 's trash why would they choose to live on deadly land ? are they unaware of the risks , or crazy enough to ignore them , or both ? it 's hard for us -- especially @entity131 with deeper connections to our laptops than any piece of soil -- to understand			1
but these women see their lives in a decidedly different way			0
when i asked @entity109 about radiation , she replied : " radiation does n't scare me			0
" it 's all about context			2
they lived through @entity147 's @entity146 -- the genocide - by famine of the 1930s that wiped out millions of @entity50 -- and then the @entity151 in the1940s			2
some of the women were shipped to @entity154 as forced labor			0
when the @entity1 accident happened a few decades into @entity159 rule , they were simply unwilling to flee an enemy that was invisible			1
so long as they were well beyond child bearing , self - settlers were allowed to stay " semi-illegally			0
" five happy years , the settlers logic went , is better than 15 condemned to a high - rise on the outskirts of @entity167			0
the residents of the @entity1 region are forest - dwelling steppe people of @entity50 's @entity171 region and did not adapt well to urban environments			1
there is a simple defiance common among them : " they told us our legs would hurt , and they do , " one 80 - year - old woman told me			0
" @entity54 : why our universe might exist on a knife edge what about their health ? there are benefits of hardy living from the land -- but also complications from an environment laced with radioactive contaminants , such as cesium , strontium and americium			0
the @entity197 predicts more than 4,000 deaths will eventually be linked to @entity1			1
@entity199 and others put that projection into the tens of thousands			2
all agree thyroid cancers are sky high , and that @entity1 evacuees have suffered the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere , including anxiety , depression , radioactive contamination from the accident has been death - dealing , to be sure , but relocation trauma is another , less - examined fallout of @entity1			1
of the old people who relocated , one @entity1 medical technician , whose job is to give annual radiation exposure tests to zone workers said : " quite simply , they die of anguish			1
" home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka , and connection to the land is palpable			1
they told me : " if you leave you die , " " those who left are worse off now			2
they are all dying of sadness , " " @entity233 is @entity233			0
" @entity54 : architecture at home in its community curiously , what sounds like faith may actually be fact			2
there are n't studies to refer to ( after all , semi-legal marginalized old women living on radioactive land are hardly a civic or research priority ) but surprisingly these women who returned home have , according to local officials and journalists who have kept track of them , seem to have outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation -- by some estimates , up to 10 years			2
how could this be ? certainly , their exposure at an older age put them at smaller risk			0
( @entity262 animals -- and i 'm including humans here -- are more severely affected by radiation			0
) but let 's consider a less tangible though equally powerful idea			2
does happiness affect longevity ? is the power of motherland , so fundamental to that part of the world , palliative ? are home and community forces that can rival even radiation ? i believe so			2
and unfailingly , so do the babushkas of the @entity40			0
radiation or not , these women are at the end of their lives			0
but their existence and spirit will leave us wondering about the relative nature of risk , about transformative connections to home , and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self - determination			1
they are unexpected lessons from a nuclear tragedy .			0

@entity297 *''* worst . area still highly contaminated
she says thousands relocated rural @entity1 to city , but 1,200 defiantly came back to live
most are babushka 's , unwilling to be displaced from even an *irradiated* homeland
@entity306 : they tend to outlive those who left . why ? personal agency ? the tonic of home ?
