-- @entity2 police continued to search friday for a suspect in the brutal rape of 15 - year - old girl who was walking to school near one of the city 's @entity9 routes for children			1
meanwhile , as the crime put national attention again on @entity2 's violence , police superintendent @entity12 made a surprise visit to a community meeting thursday night , where residents expressed anger and outrage over the crime			1
the 15 - year - old girl remains hospitalized , with a head injury suffered in the assault			1
" the young lady is still on the fence , if you will , as far as how she 's doing , " @entity12 told the gathering of parents and other residents in the @entity28 neighborhood on the city 's northwest side			1
" we 're going to make sure that we catch this monster			1
we 're going to make sure that it does n't happen again in this community or in any other community in the city of @entity2 , " @entity12 added			2
the 15 - year - old girl was walking to her high school in predawn darkness when an assailant hit her on the head , dragged her between two houses to a yard and raped her , police said , with the assault taking place just a half - block away from one of the city 's " @entity9 " school routes especially for students			1
just this fall , local officials pledged that an expanded @entity54 program -- with its big yellow signs above sidewalks patrolled during key times by paid , trained workers -- would be a sanctuary for children walking to and from school			0
the initiative came as @entity2 became the nation 's homicide capital of @entity65 in 2012 , according to @entity67 statistics			2
this school year , city and school officials doubled the number of @entity9 routes to accommodate more children being forced to walk greater distances because the school system closed a record 48 elementary schools amid a $ 1 billion budget shortfall			0
about 12,000 students are attending new schools this year because of the budget crisis , and many of them must walk through some of @entity2 's most violent neighborhoods			2
this week , local authorities noted that the 15 - year - old victim was walking to school tuesday morning a half - hour before her nearby @entity87 route was staffed with patrols			1
a resident found the girl half - naked and bleeding from the head on a snowy walkway at the side of his home			0
she lay for about two hours in the cold before she was discovered			0
she was conscious but barely moving when she was found , authorities said			0
" just opening up the door , and take a morning sweep of the sidewalks and to find something like that is just shocking , " said @entity98 , the resident on the city 's northwest side who found the schoolgirl			0
the snow outside his home was still stained thursday			0
@entity0 's @entity108 and @entity109 reported from @entity2 .			0
