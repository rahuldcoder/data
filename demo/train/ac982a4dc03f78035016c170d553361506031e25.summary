-- no issue has been hotter throughout the run - up to the election than jobs -- and both candidates took pains to tackle the issue during their first debate wednesday at the @entity9			2
" over the last 30 months , we 've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created , " @entity11 incumbent @entity10 said			1
the facts : in 2009 , @entity10 's first full year in office , people in states across the country were losing their jobs at a startling clip			1
in @entity23 , the unemployment rate was 10.6 %			0
but over the next few years , the nation saw slow increases in employment in the retail , education and health care sectors			2
today , most states are gaining jobs			0
the key swing state of @entity23 now has a 7.2 % unemployment rate			0
the @entity34 confirms that a lot of jobs have been created under @entity10 's leadership -- 4.4 million by the bureau 's latest count			1
what @entity10 did not say , however , was that the nation shed 4.3 million jobs during the early days of his term , and that the net gain since he took the oath of office in january 2009 is just 125,000 jobs			1
complete coverage of @entity0 's @entity49 conclusion : many voters blame that initial weakness on the fractured economy @entity10 inherited from his @entity54 predecessor , former president @entity53			1
but in terms of sheer numbers , @entity10 's assertion that he created 5 million jobs does not tell the whole story and is therefore false			1
also during the debate , @entity54 presidential candidate @entity60 said that 23 million people are out of work in the nation			1
" there is suffering in this country , " said @entity60			2
" and we talk about evidence			0
look at the evidence of the last four years			0
we 've got 23 million people out of work			1
" the facts : when the recession began , workers in every category lost jobs , but those in the middle and higher wage groups lost more of them			0
and when the jobs started coming back , the lower - wage jobs came back stronger			0
that means that , while the nation has replaced lost jobs , many of those new jobs pay less than the old ones did			2
to reach his 23 million figure , @entity60 counts everyone who is unemployed , has stopped looking for work or is underemployed -- working for less money than before or able to find only a part - time job			1
conclusion : @entity60 is stretching his figures to the breaking point -- which makes his claim false			2
what it all means : if history is any guide , the employment figures could prove key in this race			1
in august , the @entity102 unemployment rate was 8.1 % , according to the @entity34			0
no president has been re-elected with an unemployment rate above 8 % since @entity105 in the 1930s , during the @entity107			0
fact check : oil and gas production fact check : is @entity111 a small businessman ? fact check : seniors drug prices fact check : @entity118 energy			0

president @entity10 says he created 5 million jobs
@entity60 says 23 million people are out of work in the nation
employment figures could prove key to this race
