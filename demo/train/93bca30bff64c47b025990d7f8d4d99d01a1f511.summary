heading off to spot the @entity0 ? sometimes the hunting begins long before the trip , with the search for perfect safari accessories			1
to help lay the groundwork , we 've tracked down some of the most luxurious safari gear around			1
@entity8 a pair of @entity8 binoculars might seem like a heavy investment , but they deliver in terms of quality			2
the @entity16 binoculars , which went on sale in october , have been designed especially for big game spotters			0
they 're lightweight , weighing just 500 grams , have an extremely robust housing designed to provide protection from sand and come in a waxed canvas bag inspired by the colors of @entity25			1
@entity8 , from $ 1,605 @entity27 safari silk chiffon scarf looking for a way to ward off that brutal desert wind or simply on the hunt for a pre-safari gift for a loved one ? this beautiful safari - print scarf ca n't fail to impress			1
and the best bit ? if the all - important @entity0 do n't put in an appearance , you can just admire the wildlife on the scarf			1
@entity39 , $ 361 @entity40 travel backgammon set a safari would n't be a safari without a game of backgammon as the sun goes down -- @entity40 's @entity48 backgammon set has been designed with this in mind			1
it rolls up , so it can be stashed inside the smallest of bags , and has a zipped pocked in which the chips are stored			0
there 's also a calf leather and luxurious nubuck lining to soften the blow in case of defeat			0
@entity61 , $ 577 @entity62 backpack this backpack was inspired by @entity64 , the @entity66 explorer who spent years in @entity25			1
the coated canvas means it 's more than capable of protecting belongings from heat , sand and animal attacks ( ok , maybe not the latter ) and there are internal pockets designed to hold tablets and laptops			1
it comes with its own dust bag , although we 're assuming this is n't intended to be a permanent fixture			0
@entity39 , $ 730 @entity86 round compass cufflinks anyone heading to a swanky safari camp should avoid making the mistake of thinking there wo n't be a dress code -- those sand - blasted khakis have no place at pre-dinner cocktail hour			1
these safari - inspired cufflinks add a splash of style to the proceedings			1
@entity99 , $ 225 @entity100 leather sketchbook this quality sketchbook has a sturdy leather cover and can be fully customized			0
the drawstring tie might not be overly practical for protecting scribblings -- sorry , masterpieces -- from the elements , but the stress of getting sand on sketches might just bring out the tortured artist that many of us secretly yearn to be			1
@entity100 , $ 139.95 @entity113 - e limited edition fountain pen for penning " wish you were here " postcards to loved ones or ticking off sightings of the @entity0 , this elephant - adorned pen should be up to the task			0
the hand - decorated writing instruments even come with their own pots of ink for authenticity			0
whether anyone would want to dirty up the 21 karat gold nib and 24 karat gold plating is another matter			0
@entity129 , $ 1,596 @entity130 rolling duffle bag choosing a safari suitcase can be tricky			2
turning up with a hard - sided rolling suitcase will instantly mark out first timers as novices , but a soft - sided weathered leather creation suggests they 're trying too hard			0
this bag from @entity139 strikes a reasonable balance -- it 's large enough to carry a substantial safari kit and the rugged wheels come in handy when it comes to airport stopovers			2
@entity130 , $ 2,695 @entity147 silver - tone zebra pave flask a post-safari sundowner is an important aspect of a trip to @entity25 , and this stylish flask keeps drinks icy cool , although it 's worth bearing in mind that if gets dropped anywhere near a zeal of zebra ( that 's the collective noun for these striped beasts ) , the chances of finding it are slim			2
@entity162 , $ 35 @entity164 - @entity163 binoculars not all safari creatures are obliging enough to come out during daylight hours			2
for investigating mysterious noises at night , or tracking big beasts as the light begins to fade , a pair of night - vision binoculars come in handy			2
@entity174 - @entity163 binocs claim to offer greater depth of field than many night scopes , along with a wide viewing angle and water - resistant housing			0
