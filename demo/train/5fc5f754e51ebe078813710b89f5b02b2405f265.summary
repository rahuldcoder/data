-- it 's a number that even astrophysicist @entity2 is having a hard time wrapping his brilliant mind around			1
his @entity6 tweet commemorating the birthday of @entity8 was retweeted more than 69,000 times as of this writing , making it the most popular of his @entity12 career so far -- and , arguably , his most controversial			1
" on this day long ago , a child was born who , by age 30 , would transform the world			2
happy birthday @entity8 b. dec 25 , 1642 , " the @entity19 host tweeted			1
he followed it up with a nod to the commercialization of @entity6 : " @entity6 to all			1
a @entity25 ( @entity26 ) becomes a religious holiday ( @entity28 )			0
which then becomes a shopping holiday ( @entity31 )			0
" by then , he was on a roll			0
earlier in the day , he tweeted , " question : this year , what do all the world 's @entity35 and @entity37 call december 25th ? answer : thursday			1
" his comments drew criticism and name - calling from various corners of the internet			0
" overly reductive , deliberately cynical and unnecessarily provocative , " one person said on @entity12			0
another accused him of " trolling @entity6 today to show you how smart he is			1
" @entity2 's response to the controversy ? " imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them			1
" later friday , @entity2 pondered " my @entity57 " in a @entity56 post			2
he did not defend or disavow his comments			0
instead , in true scientific form , he attempted to quantify their popularity compared to previous tweets			2
" my sense in this case is that the high rate of re-tweeting , is not to share my enthusiasm of this fact , but is driven by accusations that the tweet is somehow anti-christian , " he wrote			2
" if a person actually wanted to express anti-christian sentiment , my guess is that alerting people of @entity8 's birthday would appear nowhere on the list			1
" according to his calculations , his average retweet rate falls between 2,500 and 3,500			0
" fun " tweets can reach 10,000 while " boring tweets barely break 1,000			2
" the @entity82 tweet had surpassed 62,000 retweets by the time he posted his @entity56 note on friday			2
by saturday evening , it had reached more than 69,000			0
" i wonder if you are as astonished by this fact as i am , " he wrote			0
for example , he directly referenced @entity91 in previous tweets that did not spread nearly as far			2
by way of example , he offered the following , which earned more than 13,000 retweets : " some claim the @entity31 is a @entity99 nation , compelling me to wonder which assault rifle @entity91 would choose : the @entity102 or @entity101			0
" he also addressed criticism that according to the calendar in use during @entity8 's time , his birthday would fall on january 4 , 1643			1
" one last bit of historical fact			0
all of @entity110 was celebrating @entity6 the day @entity8 was born			1
but the @entity111 ( an awesomely accurate reckoning of @entity114 's annual time ) , introduced in 1584 by @entity115 , was not yet adopted in @entity116			0
to do so required removing ten days from the calendar -- excess time that had accumulated over the previous 16 centuries from the mildly flawed @entity120 , introduced by @entity121 in 46 bc. these remnants of the turbulent schism between the @entity125 and @entity126 churches meant that @entity127 was celebrating @entity6 ten days earlier than anybody was in @entity110			1
" @entity2 closed his note with holiday wishes and a warning that he 'll be tweeting about @entity114 's perihelion in the @entity134			1
" just a head 's up in case people want to avert their eyes over that one			0
