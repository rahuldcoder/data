-- a @entity2 lawyer is facing license suspension for alleged deceptive advertising by photoshopping herself into cozy pictures with politicians and celebrities on her official website			0
the @entity10 is recommending @entity11 be suspended from practicing law for six months , after an investigation showed her website featured fake publicity photos of her next to president @entity16 , former president @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and others			1
the @entity24 says @entity11 's suspension does not go into effect until approved by the @entity2 @entity27 and is recommending two - and - a - half years of probation after the six - month suspension			1
on friday , @entity0 contacted @entity30 for comment , and she said she would call back shortly			1
" i will tell you much more later , " she said			0
later in the day , she declined additional immediate comment			0
she ultimately responded in a lengthy email monday that defended her position , but did not flatly deny doctoring the photos			0
misleading the public @entity11 faked many or all of the photos by taking original celebrity pictures and then overlaying her own image , the state bar court found			1
the ruling said because the " photographs were part of an advertisement and solicitation for future work ... they were false , deceptive , and intended to confuse , deceive and mislead the public			0
" but high - profile legal analyst and celebrity lawyer @entity51 does not think an attorney 's photoshop frenzy is troublesome or worth suspension			2
" if that kind of puffery is actionable by the state bar , you are going to put the entire membership of state bar out of business , " @entity51 told @entity0			1
" there is no greater group of self - promoters than lawyers , and puffery goes with the territory			0
" court documents say @entity11 answered her notice of disciplinary charges with a " 16 - page soliloquy with little to no rational connection to the charges			1
" a " sweet sixteen " response as an example , court papers cited a portion of @entity80 's response , which she wrote referring to herself in the third person : " there is a popular expression , ' sweet sixteen '			1
the foregoing 16 pages can be characterized as bitter - sweet sixteen , in @entity80 's view			2
it goes without saying as to why they are bitter			0
can one envision the acts in the civil arena , more unseemly than the ones described above ? " @entity11 came to this country in her twenties , with nothing , and married another immigrant , who also had nothing ... @entity11 's @entity100 dream has come true , as she has been able to achieve a point wherein now , in her thirties , @entity30 is a prominent donor and philanthropist , supporting important social causes , who had recently received the email from president @entity16 , with the subject line ' i need your help today ' , asking @entity11 for an additional donation			2
" @entity11 made similar statements in her monday response to @entity0 saying the pictures " represent the doors that an underdog , an immigrant woman can walk through , and the heights the first generation @entity100 can climb			1
" " i put blood , sweat and tears to finally reach a point in my life when i became a major donor and devoted supporter of numerous charitable and political causes , and got invited to the events where i was blessed with the opportunity to socialize and have my pictures taken with the talented and successful people , who have been inspiring me for my whole life , whom i admire and look up to			0
" @entity11 added : " please take a look at all my pictures , consult any computer guru if you like , and decide for yourself whether these pictures are real , authentic or photoshopped			2
" culpable of four counts @entity143 , a @entity144 of @entity146 professor with a background in legal ethics , argues lawyers ' websites and photoshopping should be controlled by the state bar so that clients can make rational choices			1
" you may not be misrepresenting law school , grades or experience , but this ( attorney 's website ) is untrue , " @entity143 said			0
" it 's suggesting you are more well - connected , more important , more successful and talented than you are			0
" state bar court judge @entity163 found sangary culpable of four total counts : deceptive advertising , two counts of failing to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation , and one count of failing to promptly release a client file			1
@entity30 's website says she 's a @entity172 graduate and her offices " concentrate on trial practice and civil litigation , specializing in all types of litigation and dispute resolution in various forums			0
" @entity0 's @entity180 contributed to this report .			2
