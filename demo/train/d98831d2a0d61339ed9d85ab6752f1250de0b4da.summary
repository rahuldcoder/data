-- when a police officer demanded that she cover her hair , @entity1 simply refused			0
" i 'm @entity4 , and i 'm not going to cover my head , " she declared			2
for that , the 35 - year - old @entity7 engineer was arrested last august and charged with " indecent dress			2
" now @entity10 faces a possible sentence of 40 lashes if a court convicts her when she faces the judge on monday			2
still , she refuses to wear a headscarf			2
@entity10 's determination to challenge arbitrary rules restricting women 's freedom is part of a wave of energy pushing against those limits , notably ( but not exclusively ) in @entity4 countries			1
in muslim - majority states in @entity28 , @entity29 , the @entity30 and elsewhere , women are relentlessly demanding more equal treatment			2
to some , the matter of whether or not to cover one 's hair may seem like a trivial issue			0
but the right to decide what one wears is a basic freedom			0
and strict rules by the government or by religious authorities dictating women 's attire are almost always the tip of the iceberg -- the most visible portion of a structure that constricts women 's freedom , taking away their right to make other important choices about their own lives			2
@entity10 herself has already pushed back			2
in 2002 , the human rights activist was arrested and convicted under the same law			0
she paid a fine for the crime of wearing pants in public			2
in 2009 , the ban against trousers snagged the journalist @entity61 and 12 other women in a @entity64 restaurant , all wearing slacks			1
several pleaded guilty , paid a fine , and were flogged for their crime			2
she was so outraged that she sent out invitations to her trial and to her possible flogging			0
in the end , the @entity74 paid the fine , but @entity69 did not waver			0
@entity7 women , she pointed out , are getting swept up under the infamous article 152 of @entity7 's @entity79			1
in the country ruled by an @entity83 party with its own interpretation of @entity85 , @entity86 law , the rules are strict but conveniently vague			0
the statute calls for punishment of up to 40 lashes for anyone committing an " indecent act " or wearing an " obscene outfit			0
" not surprisingly , the law is used mostly against women			0
government figures for 2008 said 43,000 women were arrested for clothing - related offenses in the capital alone			0
and the cases keep coming			0
a few weeks ago , police were recorded lashing a woman in the street for getting into a car with a man			1
the extraordinary displays of courage from women challenging restrictions on their lives include the case of @entity112 -- the @entity114 girl who nearly died after @entity116 gunmen shot her in the face -- and other young girls , like @entity120 's @entity119 , divorced at the age of 10 and now a campaigner against child marriage , and thousands of others			1
nobody , however , has gained the fame of @entity112 , whose call for girls to receive an education crossed the line for those who think women should remain subservient , with society under the full control of men			1
her courage frightens the @entity116			0
some in @entity114 claim that @entity112 , now a celebrity , is a product of the @entity138			1
but these outbreaks of courage , these rumblings for change , are coming from within the @entity4 world			2
@entity4 women do not need the @entity138 to tell them that inequality and second - class status for women are unacceptable			1
the rules enforcing inequality are often couched as religious mandate , but they are mostly the product of deeply traditional societies			0
the societies , however , are changing			0
women are part of those societies , and many accept the restrictions -- but not everyone is happy with the status quo			0
in most parts of the kingdom , many women , depending on the regions where they live , are required to cover themselves from head to toe , wearing the niqab , a veil that covers even the face , essentially erasing a woman 's identity while she is in public			1
most @entity159 women are accustomed to wearing it			1
for now , those demanding change are focusing on other areas			0
@entity159 women chafe under many rules			1
one of the best known is an unwritten ban on their right to drive			0
last weekend , a group of women in @entity159 defied the stunningly anachronistic rule that puts @entity159 misogyny in a category of its own			1
@entity159 women have fought for years to gain the right to drive			1
in 2011 , when they thought they might have something like a @entity190 , echoing the popular revolutions in the region , activists organized the @entity193 day			0
many were arrested after they took to the road			0
despite the arrests , they tried it again last weekend			0
some men raised an outcry			0
two @entity159 men , wearing their traditional red kaffiyehs , created an internet sensation with the parody song " no woman , @entity210 , " mocking the driving ban with a takeoff on the @entity207 hit " @entity208			1
" the video has had millions of hits , with lyrics that introduce viewers to the absurd logic of the ban , such as one @entity159 cleric 's contention that driving could damage women 's ovaries and threaten their fertility			1
the inability to drive creates a host of practical problems for @entity159 women -- problems that make them even more beholden to the whims of men			1
but other rules are even more offensive , such as the one that prohibits a @entity159 woman from leaving the house , working , studying , traveling , even receiving medical treatment without the permission of a male " guardian , " usually her husband , father , or brother -- or even a son			1
not all @entity4 countries impose terrible restrictions on women , and not all countries with profound inequality between the sexes are @entity4			1
but the worst countries in which to be a woman , according to the @entity251 's @entity250 , are almost all @entity4 - majority states in @entity28 , the @entity30 , and @entity29			1
luckily , those are also countries where women are fighting back , pushing to close the gap , armed with the conviction that the restrictions they face are not mandated by their religion , but by social norms that are subject to change			1
and that change , a call for human rights for all -- including for women -- is not an invention of the @entity138			2
it is what a woman like @entity1 demands when she says she is a @entity4 , and she simply will not be told what to wear			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity272 .			0

@entity274 : @entity7 woman faces flogging for refusing to wear a headscarf
others flogged for wearing slacks , or riding in car with man who is not relation
@entity284 : @entity4 women fighting back , refusing to comply , driving cars in @entity159
@entity284 : girls like @entity112 are *n't* products of @entity138 ; they are fighting back on their own
