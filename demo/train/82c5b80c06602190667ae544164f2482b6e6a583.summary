more than 25,000 police officers from throughout the country and even @entity15 came to @entity16 in the @entity18 neighborhood for the funeral of @entity20 , 40			1
the ceremony began when a police honor guard carried @entity20 ' casket into the church			1
then vice president @entity24 , @entity9 gov. @entity25 , @entity9 mayor @entity26 and police commissioner @entity27 delivered eulogies that were notably solemn and expressive , political and apolitical			1
@entity20 and his partner , officer @entity29 , were gunned down december 20 as they sat in their patrol car in @entity32			1
the gunman , @entity33 , shot himself at a subway shortly afterward			0
he earlier posted angry messages on social media against police and government , citing two black men killed by officers			1
@entity29 's funeral will be january 4			2
during saturday 's service , @entity27 announced he was appointing @entity20 as an honorary @entity44 chaplain and posthumously promoting @entity20 and @entity29 to the rank of detective			1
the service ended with trumpeters playing taps and " @entity55 " as the pallbearers carried the casket to a hearse attended by the @entity20 ' widow and two sons			1
several police helicopters flew in formation above a vast crowd of officers wearing white gloves , and then hundreds of police motorcyclists rumbled as lead escorts of the cortege			1
officers formed endless chains holding hands in prayer during the funeral			1
" i have 31 years on the job , i 've never seen such a show of support as we have today , " said @entity69 , head of the city 's police union			1
@entity24 : " it 's an uncommon fraternity " as impressive as the display of blue was under the clear skies , the tributes inside the church moved mourners to tears , applause -- even moments of levity			0
at times , the eulogies and officers ' reactions captured how a nation struggles with the honor and conduct of police in the wake of citizen killings			1
at one point , scores of officers turned their back on a large tv screen showing the live address by the mayor inside the church			1
tensions between the @entity44 and the mayor came to a boil during recent protests after a grand jury declined to indict an officer in the death this summer of @entity109 in @entity110			1
@entity69 has said the mayor and @entity112 had " blood " on their hands for supporting critics and protesters against police			1
after saturday 's funeral , @entity69 declined to comment directly about the officers ' about - face			1
" the feeling is real , but today is about mourning ; tomorrow is about debate , " he said			1
when asked what he would tell those protesting officers , @entity69 stated : " we have to understand the betrayal that they feel , but today we also come to bow our head in mourning , and tomorrow we 'll debate			1
" saturday , @entity131 released the following statement on behalf of the @entity133 : " the @entity20 and @entity29 families , our police department and our city are dealing with an unconscionable tragedy			1
our sole focus is unifying this city and honoring the lives of our two police officers			1
" on sunday , @entity27 said he believed the scores of police officers who turned their back on @entity26 during speech at the funeral acted inappropriately			1
" i certainly do n't support that action yesterday			0
i think it was very inappropriate at that event			0
that funeral was held to honor officer @entity20			1
and to bring politics , to bring issues into that event i think was very inappropriate and i do not support it , " @entity27 told @entity156 ' " @entity155			0
" on @entity158 's " @entity157 , " @entity27 said the " rift " would likely go on for a " while longer			0
" " the issues go on far beyond race relations in this city			0
they involve the labor contracts , they involve a lot of history ... different from some of what 's going on in the country as a whole , " @entity27 said			0
@entity24 , the first eulogizer , focused on the @entity20 family 's loss			1
" i 'm sure i speak for the whole nation when i say our hearts ache for you , " the vice president told the family during the service			0
he said the thousands of officers surrounding the church " will stand with you for the rest of your life			2
" " it 's an uncommon fraternity , " @entity24 said of the police			2
he added , " thank @entity187 for them			0
" " amen , " some in the church said			0
" this is the finest police department in the world , " @entity24 added , drawing applause			2
he added that the bullets that targeted the officers also " targeted the city , and ( they ) touched the soul of an entire nation			2
" @entity25 mentions threats , " abusive tirades " the governor led the congregation in delivering a round of applause to the @entity20 family			1
then , he made note of protesters who have taken strong exception to police conduct and the recent deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police			1
@entity25 praised the professionalism of the @entity44 officers during tense demonstrations in the city			1
" the @entity44 protected the right of free speech even though they were targets of false and abusive tirades , " the governor said			2
" what a beautiful testament to their professionalism			0
" he also noted threats against police			2
" the threats against the @entity9 police are insults to the law - abiding and wo n't be tolerated , " @entity25 said , adding that the @entity235 " has your back every step of your way			2
" anyone making threats " will be investigated , and they will be prosecuted , " @entity25 added			0
@entity25 also delivered a measure of relief when he spoke of @entity20 ' two sons			2
" @entity242 and @entity243 are @entity245 fans , which tells us a lot of about them			0
it means they are really tough and really committed and really , really , really loyal , " @entity25 said , drawing widespread laughter			0
mayor avoids politics a couple of officers booed @entity26 when he arrived for the funeral			1
some protest signs against him , including " @entity258 , " could be seen , but they were small displays and officers were largely polite			2
some officers turned their backs on the church as the mayor spoke			1
ill feelings toward @entity26 stem from critics ' contention that -- amid protests that arose after a grand jury 's refusal to indict a police officer in the july death of @entity109 in @entity110 -- the mayor was not supportive of the police			2
some have accused him of fomenting an anti-police fervor that contributed to the deaths of @entity29 and @entity20			2
nonetheless , in his remarks @entity26 did not comment on protests or threats against police			2
instead , he hailed @entity20 for his desire to serve people in many ways			2
@entity20 spent the last 10 weeks of his life studying to be a chaplain , and he was to graduate on the day he was killed			1
" he was already serving in so many ways , and yet he felt deeply called to serve spiritually , as well , " de @entity26 said			0
" our hearts are aching today , " the mayor said			2
" i feel it physically			2
... @entity9 has lost a hero -- a remarkable man because of the depth of his commitment to all around him			0
" he offered condolences to @entity20 ' family , and then to the @entity44 , who he said is " hurting so deeply right now			1
" @entity20 made honorary chaplain the police commissioner drew applause when he stated that @entity20 " was a hero			1
" the pair were killed , @entity27 observed , simply because of the uniform they wore			0
" they were killed because they were blue			0
" " officer @entity20 was assassinated because he represented all of us , " @entity27 said			2

" ( @entity343 ) e was the best father i could ask for , " @entity243 wrote after the shooting			0
