-- as @entity6 prepare for their milestone presidential election this week , thousands of activist youths who spearheaded the revolution -- the very ones who made the election possible -- will not be casting a vote			1
instead , they are in prison , facing military trials			2
on may 4 , more than 350 protesters , including 16 women and 10 children , were arrested near @entity14 in the @entity16 neighborhood of @entity16 , adding to the approximately 12,000 political prisoners detained since the revolution			1
the @entity16 protesters fortunate enough to be released from detention have revealed horrific stories of torture and abuse at the hands of military officers			1
interrogators hurled abusive insults at them and said sarcastically that any future president would be working under the orders of the ruling military council , better known as the @entity32			1
their accounts dash any illusions that the lead - up to the election , complete with formal televised debates and countless informal discussions on the streets , represents a new era of freedom in @entity6			2
on multiple occasions since march 2011 , the military police have tortured and abused protesters , according to a recent report from @entity46			2
despite repeated promises to investigate , @entity6 's ruling military council has shown little action and no one has been held accountable			1
the girls who were imprisoned for protesting on may 4 heard screams of their fellow protesters being beaten and tortured in cells above them			0
one girl who has made public statements after being released was too shaken to bring herself to describe what happened to her and other girls			0
of the 15 boys released in early may -- because they had student identification cards -- one of them , 24 - year - old @entity62 , summoned the courage to recount his ordeal : " they beat us with long sticks on our backs and legs for hours ; some went unconscious and were never given any medical care and disappeared later			0
i was threatened with sexual assault with a foreign object ... " the ostensible reason behind the release of the 15 students was the timing of their final exams			0
but the young men were far too traumatized by what they suffered to take their exams			0
some have remained silent , fearing the retribution of speaking out			0
in a society where men value macho pride and unmarried women value virginity , it is courageous for young men and women who have been abused to go public about the torture and sexual violence that occur regularly to those who are held in detention			0
moreover , some of the parents are also not afraid to speak out			0
the father of @entity101 , a 17 - year - old student who was arrested on allegations of violence , spoke out about his son 's detention and rape by an officer in the @entity109 building on october 28			2
@entity101 was attending the funeral of fellow protester , @entity111 , when he got detained			0
despite being under age and having endured such brutality , @entity101 remains in detention and has been denied access to medical attention or legal council			2
the ruling military council 's widespread use of detention and trial appears unprecedented , even when measured against the time of @entity123			1
the addition of abuse and torture all adds up to a zero - sum strategy of squashing dissent and consolidating power			0
by trapping civilian protesters inside the military system , the ruling military council completes the cycle of intimidation against @entity6 citizens			1
according to @entity137 , a lawyer for protesters , detainees do not file formal complaints about the beatings and tortures to the judges ( all of whom are military judges ) for fear of further detention as retribution			1
the halcyon days of the revolution when @entity6 activists proclaimed " the army and the people are one hand " are but a distant memory as the ruling military council drives an unprecedented wedge between the military and civilians , particularly the revolutionary youth			1
one doctor , who was arrested after she had treated protesters , overheard military officers inciting soldiers against the protesters : " i could hear the officers saying to the soldiers , ' these are the people who killed hundreds of soldiers			2
' so now @entity6 soldiers are made to feel that civilians are there to attack them , that we are the enemy , and they congratulate themselves for arresting us			0
" how is it possible that the @entity172 granted a human rights waiver to the ruling military council government that has instituted these brutal practices ? with the misguided calculation that the ruling military council can ensure " stability , " the @entity172 government has sacrificed its own credibility as a defender of human rights			1
as more human rights violations come to light , the @entity172 government should change its policy and hold the government accountable , rescind the waiver and condition military aid			0
when @entity6 go to the polls on wednesday for the first genuine election in their lifetimes -- a great milestone -- the voices of the " magnificent youth " who " woke @entity6 from the dead " and have fought to keep the ideals of the revolution alive should not be forgotten as they continue to be locked up in prison			0
let 's hope that one of the first acts of the new @entity6 president will be to uphold justice by releasing all the innocent political prisoners who are under detention			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 and @entity208 .			1

on the eve of @entity6 's presidential elections , protesters *clashed* with the military
@entity207 and @entity208 : military abuses those arrested and detained
they say ruling military council 's widespread use of detention and trials has no precedent
@entity6 's new president should uphold justice and release innocent detainees , they say
