-- after first saying that they could not determine a threshold for the safe amount of certain toxic chemicals in infant formula , @entity2 officials said friday that trace amounts are safe			2
worries over melamine in infant formula started in @entity11 and have spread to the @entity12			2
" amounts of the industrial chemical melamine or the melamine - like compound called cyanuric acid that are below 1.0 ppm [ 1,000 parts per billion ] do not raise public health concerns , " said @entity13 , the @entity2 's director of the @entity14			1
when it became known in september that thousands of babies in @entity11 had been sickened by tainted infant formula , the @entity2 ordered the testing of @entity12 - manufactured infant - formula products			1
@entity13 said friday that results from 74 of 87 samples of infant formula and other products babies and young children had been completed			0
the results of the other 13 are pending			0
that total differed slightly from the one the @entity2 offered thursday , when its acting commissioner of public affairs , @entity34 , told @entity0 that 77 sample results had been completed and just 10 were outstanding			0
among the 74 final test results discussed friday , the @entity2 said , two samples of @entity40 's @entity39 with @entity41 tested positive for melamine at levels of 137 and 140 parts per billion , well below the level of concern cited by @entity13			1
in addition , three samples of @entity49 's infant powder , @entity50 with @entity41 , tested positive for cyanuric acid at an average of 247 parts per billion , also well below the @entity2 trace level			1
the @entity2 's october 3 risk assessment of melamine and its analogues concluded that " levels of melamine and its analogues below 2.5 ppm in foods other than infant formula do not raise public health concerns			2
" but the agency said then that it did not have enough data to determine a safe level of melamine and its analogues in infant formula			0
on friday , an @entity2 official said it was still not possible to determine a safe level for infant formula containing both melamine and cyanuric acid compounds , but officials " believe that at very low levels there should not be any health concerns			1
" @entity13 said the trace levels of melamine or related compounds detected in the samples are 10,000-fold less than the amount associated with @entity11 infant - formula contamination			1
according to the @entity87 , contaminated infant formula in @entity11 has killed four babies and caused more than 47,000 infants and children to be hospitalized with possible kidney stones			0
@entity11 - made infant formula is not available in the @entity12 , because no @entity11 manufacturer meets the requirements to sell infant formula in this country , according to the @entity2			1
it was also the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid in pet food that caused thousands of dogs and cats to be sickened last year in the @entity12			2
the combination caused crystals to form in the animals ' kidneys			0
according to the @entity2 's updated @entity108 , infants are more vulnerable to the combination than are older children or adults because formula could be the infants ' sole source of nutrition			0
in addition , their kidneys may not have developed sufficiently to ward off the impact of the chemicals .			0

melamine , cyanuric acid not of concern in levels below 1,000 parts per billion
@entity125 says @entity2 has tested 74 samples of @entity12 - made baby formula
some samples tested positive but at safe levels , official says
levels are far below those associated with @entity11 contamination
