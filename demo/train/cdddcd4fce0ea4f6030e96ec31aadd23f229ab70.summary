one year ago , a @entity1 street vendor set himself on fire , igniting a storm of protest that toppled his country 's oppressive government in less than a month			0
the anger swiftly spread , as activists and bloggers , organizing through social media platforms like @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , set off a season of revolution that is still shaking the @entity19 world			1
yet as the first anniversary of that event approaches , a new threat to digital activism is looming -- in the @entity24			0
on thursday the @entity25 is expected to vote on the @entity26 , which would force social media platforms to pro-actively monitor and censor users to prevent them from posting words or images that might violate copyright			1
website operators who fail to do so could be blacklisted and prosecuted			0
the bill and its @entity35 counterpart , the @entity36 , would empower the attorney general to block allegedly infringing websites based anywhere on @entity40			0
the drafters of both bills do not mean to stifle online dissent and activism			1
their goal is to protect intellectual property , especially from piracy by websites overseas			1
the problem is that the bills ' legal and technical solutions are very similar to mechanisms that authoritarian regimes use to censor and spy on their citizens			2
our organization , @entity55 , is an international network for citizen media			2
we support the protection of intellectual property ; many members of our community earn all or part of their living by creating copyrighted work			0
we worry , though , that the @entity26 and @entity36 will inflict broad unintended damage on digital activists living under repressive regimes as well as restrict speech freedoms at home			0
even existing copyright law is abused in attempts to stifle criticism and public debate			1
take the case of @entity77 , a security researcher who wrote a critical blog post last month about a little - known software program called @entity80 , which runs on millions of smartphones and logs information about users ' activities			2
rather than address @entity77 's claims , @entity80 responded with legal threats , accusing him of copyright violation because his analysis included copies of its manuals , even though the manuals were publicly available on the company 's own website			2
after the nonprofit @entity95 came to @entity77 's defense , the company withdrew its threats and apologized			0
if the @entity26 becomes law , online speech like @entity100 's will be more vulnerable to censorship			2
those seeking to abuse copyright law to stifle criticism will be further empowered			1
to comply with the @entity26 , @entity100 's service provider would have had to actively monitor what he was posting to prevent him from violating copyright			2
if there is doubt about whether a post is or is n't " infringing , " website operators will be under pressure to avoid legal problems just by blocking or deleting it -- even if there is a good chance a court of law would eventually rule that it is protected speech			0
in countries whose judicial systems are less independent and where legal defense for bloggers is rare , abuse of copyright law to stifle activism is much easier			1
the @entity129 government last year used a crackdown on software piracy as an excuse to confiscate activists ' computers			2
the @entity136 government used copyright claims to crack down on critics of the @entity139 who sometimes used modified images of the @entity143 mascots in their critiques			0
" in @entity136 ' copyright ' is one of many excuses to crack down on political movements , " a @entity136 blogger , @entity145 , told us			0
" if a new law like @entity26 is introduced in the @entity24 , the @entity136 government and official media will use it to support their version of ' anti-piracy			0
' " amendments could narrow or eliminate some of the bills ' most dangerous features			0
@entity158 could pass a better , though still problematic , bill			1
yet even these efforts fail to address the deeper problem : that some members of @entity158 are seeking to regulate the global internet for the benefit of the @entity24 entertainment industry			1
at the same time , members of both parties in the @entity25 and @entity35 ( including some sponsors of both bills ) have expressed impassioned support for global internet freedom , sometimes chastising the executive branch for not doing enough			1
last week rep. @entity173 , @entity174 , introduced a new version of the @entity176 , which aims to punish companies that sell censorship and surveillance equipment to authoritarian regimes or support the suppression of online dissent around the world			1
in recent years , @entity158 has repeatedly allocated funds for tools that help internet users get around those surveillance regimes			1
it is thus only reasonable to expect that @entity163 - related legislation should be consistent with @entity158 ' repeated commitment to uphold and protect rights of internet users globally			1
contributors to @entity55 on all continents face increasingly sophisticated surveillance and censorship			0
several are in jail right now because of their online activities , and others are in exile			0
passage of the @entity26 or @entity36 will send a loud signal to governments everywhere that it is fine to monitor and censor citizens ' online behavior to catch and prevent " infringing activity , " which too often means political and religious dissent			1
the result will be a world even more dangerous and difficult for bloggers and activists than it already is .			0

@entity216 and @entity217 say @entity158 is *mulling* bills to stop online piracy
laws would make social media platforms *proactively* police for copyright violations , they say
they say drafters mean to protect copyright , but effect will be to stifle dissent
writers : laws should *reflect* @entity158 ' stated aim to protect rights of internet users globally
