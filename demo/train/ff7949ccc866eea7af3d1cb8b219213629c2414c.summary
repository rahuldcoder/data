@entity0 -- president @entity2 affirmed his support for a woman 's " right to choose " on thursday , the 36th anniversary of the @entity7 decision that led to the legalization of abortion , as thousands of anti-abortion activists descended on the @entity11 to challenge his position			1
president @entity2 issued a statement defending @entity15 for protecting " women 's health and reproductive freedom			1
" @entity15 " not only protects women 's health and reproductive freedom , but stands for a broader principle : that government should not intrude on our most private family matters , " @entity2 said in a statement			1
the landmark 1973 decision held that a woman 's right to abortion was protected by the right to privacy under the @entity32 's 14th amendment , voiding most state laws against abortion at the time			2
@entity36 , who helped organize the anti-abortion @entity37 , invited @entity2 to speak at the rally			1
" @entity39 needs your strong leadership as president of all the people to stop the intentional killing of an estimated 3,000 pre-born boys and girls each day and the brutalizing of mind , heart and body of pregnant mothers			1
" @entity52 , president of the @entity53 , said she believes that while abortion should remain an option , increasing the availability and affordability of birth control and reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies is the real solution			1
" i think what everyone ought to be interested in doing , whether they are or not , is reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies , " @entity52 told @entity1			2
" because if we reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies , it will by definition reduce the number of abortions and reduce a lot of the pain and despair that has befallen women in these economic times , who can not afford to enlarge their families when they do n't have a job and they do n't have a way to put food on the table for the kids that they have now			0
" if we could all work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies , it would dramatically change the debate on this issue			0
" @entity2 has so far not struck down rules reinstated by the @entity92 administration eight years ago , prohibiting @entity39 money from funding international family planning groups that promote abortion or provide information , counseling or referrals about abortion services			1
the " @entity105 policy " was initially put in place by president @entity101 and suspended during @entity103 's presidency			2
its opponents refer to it as the " global gag order			0
" about 20 anti-abortion rights lawmakers spoke at the rally thursday , pushing for a renewed effort to overturn @entity15			1
" at what instant does life begin ? " asked rep. @entity113 , @entity114 , focusing on younger crowd members who answered , " conception ! " " and the next question is , " he continued , " president @entity2 , when did your life begin ? " other legislators detailed their plans to keep the issue on the table in @entity126 and on the minds of voters			1
rep. @entity129 , @entity130 , told the crowd she plans to introduce what she calls the " @entity133 , " referencing the hit 2008 film of the same title in which a high school teenager gives her baby up for adoption			0
" it will provide a tax credit to those women , just as we allow abortions to be tax deductible , it will provide a tax credit so that they can carry out their pregnancy , give that baby to a loving arm and not have to worry about the consequences or the costs involved , " she said			0
throughout the rally , speakers urged bold action for their cause			2
@entity52 said the fight will also continue on the pro-abortion rights side			0
" there 's no question we have a pro-choice president now , but he ca n't do it alone , " she said			2
" he ca n't pass legislation			0
he ca n't stop what 's going on at the state and local level and so the battle rages on ... at the congressional level , at the state and local level and certainly at the @entity7			2
" she said the number of unwanted pregnancies is rising , as congressional action has increased the cost of contraception for college students and low - income women , " something we hope this administration will reverse			0
" two pieces of federal legislation are pending , she said			0
the first will expand accessibility and availability of birth control , and the second , the @entity187 , is a codification of @entity15			1
now will continue pursuing both at the congressional level , she said , but noted that even though @entity126 has a @entity193 majority , it does not have a pro-abortion rights majority			0
" so that will continue to be an uphill battle , " she said @entity1 's @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
