-- its claim to fame has been contested , it 's been hit by tragedy and it 's been photographed by tourists from around the world			1
but locals still hold firm to their conviction that @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , holds the @entity12 for being the steepest street in the world , with a 38 % grade at its steepest section			1
various sources list @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , as the steepest			2
the @entity12 website lists no record for world 's steepest street , and mentions neither @entity9 nor @entity18			1
tilted disputes aside , here 's what life 's like at a slant			2
twenty - five thousand balls of chocolate are rolled down the street each year every july , thousands of giant @entity34 candies are rolled down the 350 - meter - long street in @entity10 's annual @entity36			1
each candy is numbered and participants can buy a corresponding ticket and hope their @entity34 will be the winner			0
all proceeds go to charity , and participants can wait at the bottom and get free candy			0
you may feel guilty having your mail delivered @entity48 has been delivering mail on @entity9 for the past two years			1
he says he 's in better shape thanks to the route , and that the adjacent streets are no cakewalk , either , since they 're almost as steep			0
it 's always an entertaining walk , he says , since visitors often stop and talk to him			0
while @entity48 prefers to deliver the mail starting at the top of the hill , 17 - year - old paperboy @entity58 says going down is actually harder than going up			0
there 's no exercise like going home @entity9 resident @entity65 , 63 , started a weight - loss program after he lost his job and began gaining weight 15 years ago			1
his program ? just going up and down his street			0
he runs up and down the street 30 times almost every day -- a total of more than 10 kilometers			2
his personal best is 105 times in one day			0
tourists come from around the world ; residents are over it when deciding to move to @entity9 , @entity79 says she was n't concerned about the grade , but rather the number of tourists who 'd be passing her home each day			1
" i love meeting people -- you ca n't really go out of the front gate without meeting someone from across the world , " says @entity84			2
she figures her husband has already shown up in more than 100 tourist photos while working in their garden , but says she 'd be doing the same thing if she were visiting			0
meanwhile , she 's only been to the top of her street once and her husband has n't made it up yet			2
there are a few incentives to get to the top last year , @entity10 artist @entity101 painted a mural at the top of the street			1
he says one of the hardest parts about painting it was driving up the hill every day			0
" it may have been a better idea to just walk as i think it ruined my car , " he says			0
there 's a rumor that certain residents on @entity9 will offer visitors a certificate of completion if they can make the trek			1
some bright soul also installed a drinking fountain			0
more : is @entity11 's @entity121 the best burger joint on the planet ?			1

@entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , holds the @entity12 for world 's steepest street
or so the town *insists* -- others dispute the claim
@entity132 says going down is actually harder than going up
