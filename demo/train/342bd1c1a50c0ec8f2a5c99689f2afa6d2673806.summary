-- it 's just another coming of age story -- one we 've all heard before -- but now it 's about us			0
just as @entity4 awoke to the excitement of the adult world around him and wanted to escape the phonies , youth voters brought a novel and intense energy to the world of politics during the 2008 election in an effort to escape the phonies we 'd been listening to our whole lives			1
our debut into the world of politics was significant : the candidate with overwhelming youth support , @entity21 , came out on top			1
i was too young to vote in that election , but after volunteering for the @entity21 campaign , i felt what many first - time voters and volunteers felt after the last election : proud , accomplished and significant			1
four years later , what was once to us the novel and exciting adult world of politics now seems bitter and partisan			0
we 're a little bit older , less bright - eyed and a little more cynical			0
it is not surprising that a generation not tempered by past disappointments , that had hoped its representatives would work in good faith to fix @entity41 's problems , might be less enthusiastic this time around			2
the percentage of youth voters who plan on voting fell from 78 % in 2008 to just 58 % this summer			1
we 're the least likely of any age group to vote in november			0
opinion : what democrats need to do in @entity48 but what a mistake it would be for us to throw in the towel now			0
just because our politics and government can disappoint us sometimes does n't mean we should forget how far we 've come			2
president @entity21 understands what our generation contributed in 2008			1
he knows where we stand on issues and he agrees with us -- he 's been our biggest ally in @entity59 since the start of his presidency			2
the president 's signature legislative achievement , the @entity62 , allows us to stay on our parents ' health plan until we are 26			1
that means we 'll have health insurance when we graduate from college , which more and more of us will be able to do thanks to the president 's push to double funding for @entity73 and his insistence on keeping interest rates low for the 7.4 million students taking out student loans			1
because of @entity21 's repeal of " @entity79 , " anyone can join the military , regardless of sexual orientation , an issue important to our generation			1
when @entity84 refused to pass the @entity85 , @entity21 changed policy administratively , enabling immigrants who came to the country as children to avoid deportation			1
opinion : can @entity21 convince voters to turn to him again ? our president showed both political courage and moral responsibility when he stood up for women across @entity41 under attack from extreme @entity100 rhetoric and aggressive legislation curtailing women 's rights and threatening women 's health			1
@entity21 's swift , bold action to fix the broken @entity41 economy bequeathed to him by president @entity106 has preserved homes and jobs for our parents and has preserved the possibility for home ownership and jobs for us			1
@entity21 has acted aggressively on the issue most important to my generation : climate change			1
our generation believes in healing the @entity118			0
between 2010 and 2011 , the @entity41 cut its foreign oil imports by 10 % , or 1 million barrels a day			0
domestic natural gas production has increased during each year of the @entity21 presidency , providing jobs and a cleaner source of energy			1
after saving the @entity41 auto industry , the president then set out to strengthen it by demanding that car companies stay competitive in a global market and meet a 54.5 miles per gallon standard by 2025			0
finally , in addition to investments in clean energy projects and jobs , @entity21 agrees with the 97 % of scientists who recognize humans as the cause of climate change , while @entity139 " is n't sure			1
" @entity140 : to win , @entity21 must make history again to be sure , none of this has come easily or without opposition			2
part of growing up is realizing the frustrating , heartbreaking truth that intense and sustained long - term effort is needed to effect change			1
the difficulty of the obstacles that must be overcome and the scope of the fight that must be won make our accomplishments all the more impressive			0
electing the first @entity156 - @entity41 president was a tremendous accomplishment , but it has n't erased racism			2
electing the first @entity161 president , my grandfather , in 1960 , did not mean that religious intolerance disappeared from our land			0
whether it was the @entity166 , the @entity167 or the civil rights movement , change has never come easy , and @entity41 have always had to fight for change we believe in			0
if we can appreciate the long strides our country has made since 2008 instead of dismissing them as imperfect attempts , we will prove that not only are we quick learners but we 're in it for the long haul			0
participation in the democratic process is not only a right : it 's a responsibility we all share			0
voting is something we can all do for our country			0
if we turn out to re-elect this president , we will prove that 2008 was not an anomaly , and that our generation and its concerns can not be dismissed			2
instead , 2008 will be seen as just the beginning			0
this fall let 's display a deep commitment to our country , its ideals and provide a preview of the @entity41 we intend to build			0
