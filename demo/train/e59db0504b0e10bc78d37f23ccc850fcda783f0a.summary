-- we do n't need recent news that @entity6 is ahead in key swing states to teach us who 's going to be president for the next four years			1
the way @entity6 speaks and the way his campaign uses language will go a long way in warming the hearts of those who vote more on the basis of the gut than on policy details or preset commitments			2
@entity22 's recent surmises on how cultural differences have determined the differing fates of @entity25 and the @entity26 have an analogue here			1
@entity22 and @entity6 come from different linguistic cultures , and unfortunately for @entity22 , his is increasingly obsolete			1
@entity22 not only looks but talks " like a president			2
" few consider @entity6 's speaking style un-presidential either , but @entity22 's speaking style , that of the airline pilot or the man in the gps saying " turn right , " is even more of what we think of as how the commander in chief talks			1
however , that vision -- informed by memories of @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity44 's president @entity43 on " @entity45 " -- is now out of step with what really stirs people in their guts about public figures			2
the cool , wasp - y voice now has an archaic ring to it , redolent of what @entity54 long ago dismissed as the @entity56			0
our era prefers a folksier voice , in real life , in movies , in music and even in our candidates for high office			1
this is partly due to the egalitarian preferences that the 1960s counterculture left in its wake , and partly that nonstop television and web coverage simulates intimacy			0
even @entity72 tried to fake a @entity74 cadence speaking to working - class white audiences in 2008 , in a way that neither @entity41 nor @entity42 would have dreamed of trying to pull off			0
@entity6 , however , comes to folksy cadence naturally			1
it 's part of his speech repertoire as a black @entity80			1
some think him " fake " when sounding preacherly in speeches to the @entity83 , but they miss that @entity6 is doing just what most black @entity80 do 24/7 , sliding between two ways of talking : vanilla and chocolate			1
@entity22 's stuck with the vanilla , while @entity6 even mixes in a bit of chocolate in mainstream speeches			1
as such , he has a warmer speech presence			0
his very intonation of " yes , we can ! " was indicative : it would have sounded hollow in the mouths of @entity72 or @entity96 and downright pathetic from @entity97			0
his repeated incantations of " pass this bill " in his address to @entity101 last september made his address sound almost like a church sermon			0
the approachability of his cadence makes even the swipes he takes at @entity107 sound less barbed than they would from @entity22			2
we hear often that the taller candidate always wins			0
it 's also true that for decades , the warmer speaker has			1
@entity114 's @entity113 inflections made both @entity115 and @entity116 sound like schoolteachers			0
@entity119 's light , scratchy drawl created an instant approachability that made @entity114 the father sound like a patrician and @entity122 like the @entity124 pitchman he eventually became			0
yet , even @entity114 the father sounded approachable and " nice " -- recall @entity130 's send - up -- compared with @entity127 ' beige speaking style			0
@entity133 , smiling with a dusting of wry , sounded like your grandfather			0
@entity138 , despite the @entity137 accent , always sounded a bit sad and sanctimonious , while @entity140 sounded like your accountant			0
the language gulf between @entity6 and @entity22 is even on view on their websites			1
@entity22 's , as i write , is bedecked with moral responsibility and learn the truth , negatives like @entity6 is n't @entity149 , and the petulant you did build that			1
meanwhile , @entity6 's site gives us snapshot , faces , listen up , loving , and chocolate ( all of which also could be taken as evoking the @entity157 as a family ! )			2
to voters on the fence , what will appeal more : truth and responsibility or snapshots and chocolate ? the answer is clear			0
in an ideal world for @entity22 , his media coaching would include @entity171 - style speech lessons from @entity172 or @entity173 short of that , a presidential candidate who sounds like your father 's history teacher is dragging along quite the linguistic ball and chain			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity22 's linguistic culture is increasingly becoming obsolete , says @entity182
our era prefers a folksier voice in our candidates for high office , @entity182 says
@entity182 : as a black @entity80 , @entity6 comes to folksy cadence naturally
for decades , the warmer speaker has won the election , says @entity182
