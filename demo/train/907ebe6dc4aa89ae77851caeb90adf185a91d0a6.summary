it 's an image that tugs at the heartstrings			2
a smiling 7 - year - old girl poses in her cheerleading uniform , circled by a ring of pompons , her bald head a telltale sign of her chemotherapy treatments			2
the photo hit @entity10 last year and popped up all over with messages of support			1
" like " to show this little girl you care			2
" share " to tell her she 's beautiful			0
pray for her to beat cancer			0
but here 's the truth			0
the photo was nearly six years old			0
and neither the girl , nor her parents -- who never posted it to @entity10 -- had any idea it was being used that way			1
welcome to the world of @entity10 " like farming			1
" those waves of saccharin - sweet posts that sometimes fill your news feed may seem harmless			2
but all too often , they 're being used for nefarious purposes			0
at best , a complete stranger may be using the photos to stroke their own ego			0
at worst , experts say , scammers and spammers are using @entity10 , often against the site 's rules , to make some easy cash			1
and they 're wiling to play on the good intentions of @entity10 users to do it			1
" the average user does n't know any better , " said @entity47 , founder of @entity48 , a website that monitors scams and other illegal or unethical behavior on @entity10			1
" i think their common sense tells them it 's not true , but in the back of their minds , they think ' what if it is true ? what does it hurt if i press like ? ' or whatever			0
" what does it hurt ? " i was first shocked , " said @entity66 of @entity67 , @entity68 , whose daughter was the subject of that photo			0
" after being notified by a friend who recognized the girl in a @entity10 post , @entity66 tracked the image back to a link she 'd posted to her @entity78 account in a community forum in 2009 , two years after it was taken			1
her daughter , who was diagnosed with @entity82 neuroblastoma in early 2007 , has been featured in local news segments for her fundraising efforts to fight cancer through @entity86			0
but her mom said she was always part of the decision and was happy to help publicize the fight			0
" this ? this was entirely different and entirely out of our control , " @entity66 said			0
" that 's the most gut - wrenching part : the total lack of control			0
" hurting the people featured in the posts , and their families , is n't the only risk of sharing such content			2
sometimes , a single click can help people who are up to no good			2
often , @entity47 said , @entity10 pages are created with the sole purpose of spreading viral content that will get lots of likes and shares			1
once the page creators have piled up hundreds of thousands of likes and shares , they 'll strip the page and promote something else , like products that they get a commission for selling			1
or , they may turn around and sell the page through black - market websites to someone who does the same			1
it 's a way to trick @entity10 's algorithm , which is designed to give more value to popular pages than the ones , like scams and spam , that pop up overnight			1
" the more likes and shares and comments and that sort of thing you have , the more likely it is to be seen by other people , " @entity47 said			1
" if they 're looking to sell the page in a black - hat forum somewhere , that 's what the value of the page is			1
" it gets worse sometimes , the threat is more direct			0
the " new " page may be used to spread malware -- software that attacks the user 's computer -- or for phishing , the act of trying to gather credit card numbers , passwords or other personal information through links to phony giveaways or contests			2
simply liking a post , or the page itself , ca n't spread a virus or phish a user			2
but malicious @entity10 apps can , as can external links that page owners may choose to share to their followers			1
if the page owner has access to @entity10 's developer tools , they can collect data on the people who like the page			1
personal information like gender , location and age can be used to target more personalized attacks			0
the kind of posts used run a gamut from cute to tasteless , from manipulative to misleading			2
@entity66 said she still finds her daughter 's photo on @entity10 from time to time , even though @entity10 eventually deleted the original after she and others reported it			1
on the most recent page she found , the picture appears in a feed alongside posts such as " who loves @entity191 fries ? like & share if you do " and multiple images encouraging people to like and share if they love @entity196			1
there 's an image of a premature baby , pictures of military troops cuddling puppies and an image of a young boy pouring water on a man 's cigarette with the text " sorry papa ... i need you			0
" " it 's anything that 's going to kind of tug at the heartstrings : the sick kids , the animal abuse , acting like it 's some kind of pet shelter , " @entity47 said			0
" that 's the bad part with the scammers			0
they hit people where they 're vulnerable , play on their emotions			0
" what to do because of @entity10 's sheer size , he said it sometimes takes lots of reports for the site to delete an offensive or misleading image , or shut down the page it came from			1
the best approach , @entity47 said , is to think before sharing			0
" if it sounds too good to be true , do n't click on it , " he said			2
" if it 's something that 's obviously geared toward tugging on the heartstrings , check it out first			0
" @entity10 said it continues to work to make sure high - quality content surfaces for users and low - quality posts do n't			1
that includes trying to diminish the reach of posts that appear to be " like farming " attempts			1
" people have told us they associate requests to like or share a post with lower quality content , and receiving that type of feedback helps us adjust our systems to get better at showing more high quality posts , " a @entity10 spokesperson said via e-mail			1
" if you see a post that 's low quality and seems to be focused only on gaining traffic , hover over the top - right corner of the post and click the arrow to report it			0
" @entity10 uses " automated and manual methods to swiftly remove links and pages that violate our policies , " the spokesperson said			1
" we 're always making improvements to our detection and blocking systems to stay ahead of threats			2
" ' truly angry ' today , @entity66 's daughter is 13 -- an eighth - grader who has shown no signs of her cancer since september 2007			0
but her mom compares that cheerleading photo to the mythical hydra , a monster with many heads that sprouts two more each time one is cut off			0
based just on the images she 's found and reported , the photo has been liked and shared on @entity10 hundreds of thousands of times			1
a search monday also found it popping up on @entity287 , as well as one site where it was wrongly used alongside a 2010 article about actor @entity291 helping a girl with leukemia find a bone - marrow donor			0
" what makes me truly angry , though , is knowing that they 're using it as an insidious way to make money , " @entity66 said			2
" that 's not what her survival is about to us			0
" for this article , @entity304 sent a @entity10 message to the owner of the last page where @entity66 found the photo			1
when asked whether he planned to sell his page , the owner replied with two words : " how much ? "			2

" like farming " on @entity10 takes *advantage* of users ' good intentions to make posts go viral
making a page more popular with likes and shares makes it show up for more users
owners can then use the popular page to advertise , or sell it to someone else
often , images and videos are used without *permission* of their owners
