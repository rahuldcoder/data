-- to @entity2 , a 17 - year - old high school senior in @entity3 , @entity4 , it was an innocent hug			1
" you never know what someone 's going through , " @entity2 told @entity0 affiliate @entity5 in @entity6			1
" a hug might help			0
" it did n't in this case because after @entity2 hugged a teacher , he ended up with a year - long suspension from @entity15 , putting his college plans in jeopardy			1
" he 's a senior ; he plays football			2
he was getting ready for lacrosse season , and you are stripping him of the opportunity to even get a full scholarship for athletics for college , " @entity19 , @entity2 's mother , told @entity5			1
the elder @entity2 , who says she and her son call themselves huggers , said she was dumbfounded to learn of her son 's suspension after hugging a teacher			1
surveillance video captures the hug in question , showing @entity2 placing his arms around the teacher and giving her a hug			2
the teacher then pushes him away			0
according to a discipline report obtained by @entity5 , the teacher said @entity2 's lips and cheeks touched her neck and that she had warned @entity2 about hugging in the past			1
asked if he kissed the teacher , @entity2 told the television reporter he did not			2
he said he has hugged teachers many times before , including this teacher , and has never been warned			0
in a statement , @entity50 , a spokesperson for the @entity51 , told @entity0 , " hearing officers consider witness testimony , a review of the known facts , and a student 's past disciplinary history -- including long - term suspensions that result in alternative school placement -- when determining consequences			1
" " if a parent has concerns about the outcome of a panel , he or she is entitled to appeal the decision to the @entity68 , " @entity50 added			0
since this is a discipline issue , the law prohibits the district from sharing details about the student 's situation or the student 's past discipline history , said the spokesperson			1
@entity2 told @entity5 he does have a discipline record and previous suspensions but not for sexual harassment			1
" i have five months left in my senior year			1
i do n't see why they would take that away from me , " said @entity2			0

" the petition had more than 200 signatures as of monday evening			0
reaction online has been mixed , with many believing the punishment might be severe but raising questions about @entity2 's prior history			2
" our zero tolerance is taken a bit too far , but i have to reserve my comments since i am curious what his ' previous records ' of suspension were about , as well as his disciplinary record , " said @entity102 , a parenting advocate			2
" but i do n't think hugging constitutes sexual harassment unless he has intent otherwise and it does n't seem that way , " said @entity102			0
some commenters said the allegation that the teacher raised the issue before with @entity2 was a key point			0
" if she has warned him before and he did it again and his hand or face touches her where she believes it 's inappropriate , like ( the ) neck or breast , it 's textbook sexual harassment , " said a viewer on @entity5 's website			1
but said another commenter , " this is crazy			0
now we ca n't hug people anymore			0
what in the world ? " " something so , so innocent can be perceived as something totally opposite , " said @entity2			0
