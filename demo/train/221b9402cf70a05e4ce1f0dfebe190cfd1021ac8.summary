if just discussing divorce in public seemed taboo a few years ago , the growing trend of divorce celebrations is helping lessen the stigma surrounding the end of marriage			1
" yes , it 's sad and it 's painful , but it 's not failure , " says @entity33 , the owner of @entity13 event company @entity34 and the author of a book by the same name			0
" it 's part of life , and yet it 's the only major event for which we have no ritual			0
" a celebration communicates that divorce is ok -- life - affirming , even			1
" @entity11 , 38 , agrees			0
" it 's like an @entity51 wake			1
just because there 's been a death does n't mean you ca n't have food and drink , acknowledge the past and hope good things for the future			1
" bearing witness , wedding - style " at a wedding , you gather friends and family around and say , ' support us on this journey , ' " says @entity1 , 49 , whose 2003 post-split bash was attended by the same klatch of far - flung friends and relatives as her wedding			1
" a divorce ceremony is a way to gather them around and say , ' i 'm moving on			1
' " and that support , says @entity11 , is also practical in nature			0
" if you split up , someone 's getting the blender and someone 's not , " she says			0
" my own celebration was a way for my friends to say , ' we love you no matter what , and by the way , here are a few appliances you 're missing			0
' " believe me , a toaster means a lot more when your heart 's broken than on your wedding day , " says @entity11 , a writer , who recently organized a divorce registry at @entity93 for another friend			1
" especially if you 're out thousands of dollars in legal fees			0
" divorce parties : one size does n't fit all just as no two weddings are alike , divorcees are seeking out ( or creating from scratch ) marriage - ending markers that resonate with them			2
in @entity105 , the @entity104 offers a divorce - package fireworks display			2
@entity107 will melt and mold your wedding ring into a ( gunpowder - free ) bullet , and @entity110 sells just that : a practical , dignified way to bury your dead marriage 's hardware			1
" burning is big , " says @entity33 , who 's seen everything from wedding dresses to a husband 's trophy deer head go up in flames at divorce celebrations organized by her event - planning outfit			1
the parties -- two or three per month -- serve up signature cocktails with names like the @entity126 and the sucker , split - themed soundtracks ( " @entity129 " and " i will survive " are popular ) and dartboards adorned with the ex 's face			2
" a divorce party makes more sense than a bachelor party , " says @entity133 of @entity134 , whose luxury divorce getaways have drawn customers , about 20 percent of them female , from as far away as @entity137 and @entity138			1
" it 's a good time to blow off steam , work on your social networking skills			2
" focusing on the future " having six or 10 martinis may work for some people , but mine was n't an ex-bashing ceremony , " says @entity147 , 50 , a wedding officiant whose party took place five years after the divorce and was attended by the couple 's four sons , along with her current and former boyfriends			1
" i wanted to acknowledge the good that came out of the marriage , and let go of the anguish			2
" in that spirit , @entity1 's foundation ( and her full - time job ) celebrants @entity164 , which is devoted to celebrating life 's milestones , organizes 10 to 15 divorce events each year to help people craft rituals that have meaning for them			1
one of @entity1 's clients celebrated his divorce by gluing back together a broken glass , in a reversal of the @entity176 tradition of smashing a glass at the end of the wedding ceremony			1
" it 's not a hullabaloo ; it 's about healing and transition , " @entity1 says			0
" and everyone has their own story in a divorce -- there 's no blueprint for moving forward like there is with marriage			2
" @entity195 wellness counselor @entity193 cautions divorc√©es to consider their motives in hosting a celebration , and not to overlook the key to emotional recovery after divorce : forgiveness , of oneself and one 's ex. " if you 're feeling bitter , angry or antagonistic , a divorce party may bring out the worst in you , " warns @entity206			1
" but if you 've accepted your divorce as the next step in your growth as a person , your party is a signal to everyone that you 're ok and looking to the future			2
