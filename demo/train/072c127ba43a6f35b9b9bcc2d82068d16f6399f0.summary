-- how do you make a movie that tackles pornography not just as an '' issue '' or a product but in terms of its psychological effects ? @entity9 , the writer , director , and star of " @entity12 , " has done it			1
and he 's pulled it off in a light , fun , unlaborious way : by crafting a high - spirited yet dirty - minded romantic comedy about a @entity20 bartender , @entity19 ( @entity9 ) , who goes out to clubs and gets laid every weekend , usually with the curvaceous babe of his choice			1
she can never be the woman of his dreams , though , because those dreams have already been lost to the hardcore photographs and videos that he masturbates to every day			2
it 's not really the faces and bodies he 's coveting , it 's the behavior â € ” the moaning , screaming , make me your nasty toy insatiability , which he thinks is what sex was meant to be			2
he does n't realize that he 's watching a bill of goods made flesh			2
as @entity44 , @entity9 sports a buffed - up chest and hair greased into a stylish oil slick , and he speaks in low , flat tones , giving a witty turn as a studly '' @entity50 '' who digs his life of anonymous sex and control ; he 's like @entity54 without the fame or preening smarm			1
one night out at the club with his wingmen @entity61 ( @entity62 ) and @entity63 ( @entity60 ) , @entity57 ( @entity64 ) , as gorgeous a woman as he 's ever seen			0
he wants to get with her , and before long they 're an item			0
but then the disappointment sets in			0
in his mind , his heart , she ca n't compete with the extreme libidos of the porn world			1
it does n't help that she 's an '' addict '' too , hooked on rom - coms and their fantasy of a man who 'll cater to her every whim			0
@entity9 proves a natural filmmaker , nimbly staging @entity44 's highly amusing @entity83 confessions , along with porn montages that mimic the dopamine - charged editing of " @entity87			1
" he also gets a terrific performance out of @entity89 as @entity44 's hilariously blinkered brute of a dad			0
the bond between @entity44 and @entity94 ( @entity95 ) , the troubled older woman he meets in an adult - ed class , is n't as deftly drawn			0
she 's there to teach @entity44 lessons , and does			0
but @entity9 's intuitive performance makes even this part of the film work			1
@entity44 is a guy who needs to quit his porn addiction , but to do that , he must understand that what he 's really been having is a dysfunctional relationship with porn			2
it 's the mistress he 's devoted to and has to break up with if he wants to start living			0
