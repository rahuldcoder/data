the most chilling place i 've ever visited is the former @entity3 death camp of @entity4 , not far from @entity5 , @entity6			2
first as a series of surface impressions : the gate with the infamous sign and heinous lie , " @entity15 " ( @entity16 ) , the crematorium and gas chambers , the gallery of black and white photos			2
on our visit in the middle of winter , the atmosphere felt so charged with particles of memories and electrons of history floating around that it was like being in the middle of an electrical storm , but everyone was too horror struck to say anything			2
until then , all our knowledge of @entity36 had come from secondhand sources , like memoirs and movies			2
now we were seeing it all as if for the first time , while feeling a part of history instead of apart from it			2
and that gave the holocaust a whole new authority and authenticity			2
this is one of the purposes of " dark tourism , " a type of travel that 's been gaining ground and winning proponents as more wanderers search out " authentic experiences , " preferring hard - bitten realism to photoshopped fantasies , and home truths over tourist - board propaganda			1
the genre has also gained a newfound respectability in academic circles after the establishment of the @entity65 ( @entity66 ) at the @entity67 in @entity68 in 2012 , which defines it as : " the act of travel to sites , attractions and exhibitions of death , disaster or the seemingly macabre			1
dark tourism is a broad ranging and often contentious consumer activity that can provoke debate about how death and the dead are packaged up and consumed within the modern visitor economy			1
" these attractions , which include both the @entity84 in @entity85 and @entity86 in @entity87 , are surging in popularity among visitors to @entity90 , where sights that chronicle the @entity92 and the 2004 @entity94 tsunami , the rise of colonialism and the fallout of @entity36 , supply insights and shivers in equal doses			1
@entity101 history is full of orwellian ironies , like the oppressed turning into the oppressors			0
@entity101 , constructed by the @entity106 in 1896 to house @entity108 revolutionaries , is one such paradox -- it eventually became a jail for the communists to hold @entity113 fighter pilots grounded by gunfire over @entity115			0
when " dark tourism " destinations are presented with artistic panache the results go far beyond partisan politics and propaganda purposes			1
the " @entity101 , " as it was sarcastically dubbed by its @entity113 inmates , uses a multimedia approach to conjure the reality of death row			0
dungeon - dim lighting and effigies of shackled prisoners are combined with expressionistic etchings of inmates on the courtyard walls , grainy film footage of aerial combat scenes and an actual @entity106 guillotine used to behead @entity108 prisoners , to provide a level of physical and psychological immersion that feels like incarceration			0
@entity101 , 1 @entity101 st. , @entity141 village , @entity142 , @entity101 , @entity115 ; +84 ( 0 ) 4 824 6358 @entity143 students who come to bone up on anatomy at the @entity147 in the @entity149 capital bow to thank the skeletons in the glass cases whom they address as " ajarn yai " ( headmaster )			1
for them , this is a classroom not a crypt			0
having spent a lot of time here while researching a true crime and @entity94 horror novella about the country 's most prolific serial killer , @entity161 , whose preserved corpse is housed in a glass case , i 've been astonished by how many adolescents visit the museum to gawk at the graphic autopsy photos and @entity168 to z of murder weapons			1
but these are instructional , too			0
the images show neither the glamorized violence found in @entity175 films ( the slow motion ballet of bullets flying and bodies falling ) , nor the cartoonish violence of computer games			0
what they depict are slices of death served raw and real			0
but there 's a brighter side to dark tourism			1
in front of the glass jars holding the tiny fetuses of infants and stillborn babies , locals have left candy , dolls and toys to appease their spirits , make @entity199 merit and ward off hauntings			0
@entity147 , @entity201 , 2 @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity143 , @entity149 ; +66 ( 0 ) 2 419 7000 6363 the @entity205 , @entity206 the first time i visited the @entity209 outside @entity210 in 2003 , i was transfixed by a tree with a sign on it that read in @entity214 and @entity215 : " @entity217 tree against which executioners beat children			1
" this was done to save bullets			0
my driver pointed at the nails sticking out of the tree that had been used to drive home the regime 's barbarity and speed up the executions			1
just then , a little girl appeared , right beside the tree , her face peeking over an urn stacked with bones that went up to her neck			0
it was as if an apparition of the deceased had appeared before us , when in fact it was one of the many children who used to beg here			0
the tree is still there , but the kids are not			0
when local authorities renovated the so - called @entity205 in 2011 , this series of mass graves , where the @entity248 executed and buried the inmates of @entity250 , a high school turned torture chamber , they turned it into a full - fledged tourism spectacle , complete with audio tours , benches , refreshment stalls and souvenir stands			1
it 's certainly a much more audio - visual experience than it used to be			1
now you can listen to the @entity248 songs that once blasted from speakers to drown out the cries of the condemned men and women being beaten to death with the axles of oxcarts , or having their throats slit with the serrated edges of a palm frond			0
still , i was of those who had to wonder , as the top " tourism attraction " in @entity210 , when does big business become blasphemy ? @entity209 are located about a 30 - minute drive from the center of @entity210			1
@entity279 , @entity280 it takes a gruesome pedigree to make it onto @entity285 's top 10 list of most haunted places in @entity90 , as named in its series , " i would n't go in there			1
" sitting atop " @entity290 , " beside @entity292 graveyards and tower blocks , the @entity289 in @entity280 has just such a pedigree			0
" this was one of places that was most fascinating for me , " the show 's host , @entity295 , told @entity297			1
but it may be more haunted by history than otherworldly forces			1
" people might think it 's a ghost show , but it 's actually a history show , " said @entity295			1
" we investigate places that have ghost stories , but these places are actually haunted by history			1
a lot of terrible things happened			0
" the museum in @entity279 is no exception			0
much of its history revolves around @entity36 atrocities			0
as the legend of " @entity317 , " a despotic ruler from @entity87 , birthed the @entity86 legend , so the bloodthirsty reputation of a @entity322 police colonel named @entity323 , whose constant companion was a samurai sword he used to behead locals , created a phantom said to still haunt " @entity290			0
" a few other ghouls whose effigies adorn the trails twisting around the museum are said to roam free -- ghouls that the workers claim they saw when clearing the property some 10 years ago			0
@entity279 , @entity335 12 , @entity336 , 11960 , @entity280 ; +60 ( 0 ) 16 421 3606 tsunami tombstones the towering waves triggered by the underwater earthquake off the coast of @entity341 on december 26 , 2004 , claimed victims as far away as @entity343 and triggered aftershocks in @entity345			2
the worst natural catastrophe of the century thus far , the tsunami left a trail of havoc along @entity149 's @entity350			1
the most prominent memorial is a police boat on @entity353 -- the beach community north of @entity355 that bore the brunt of the waves ' wrath in @entity149			1
some 20 meters long and 50 tons huge , the vessel was swept about one kilometer inland , where it 's remained immobile at the bottom of a foothill			2
it 's a few minutes walk from the @entity364 , heavy on photos and videos but light on science and artifacts			2
farther down the coast , in the coastal village of @entity371 , which was almost completely annihilated after being slammed by three successive waves , two fishing trawlers , known locally as the " @entity374 " and " @entity375 , " have been left in an empty lot a kilometer inland to commemorate the 6,000 victims in @entity149			1
also in the village , the @entity379 features a wave - shaped tunnel leading past plaques , photos , flowers and other offerings for the dead			0
the images in the nearby museum chronicle the collaborations between volunteers and locals , travelers and expats , monks and medical professionals and manual laborers , who formed an hoc team of altruists in action			2
when grasping for superlatives to describe the extremities of that tumultuous situation for the final novella , " @entity406 , " in my new collection , i recalled a line from @entity409 's novel " @entity415 , " set on the @entity410 in @entity411 , one of the most important events on the dark tourism calendar : " but it 's amazing when you come to think of it how the human spirit seems to blossom in the shadow of the abattoir			1
" perhaps that could also serve as a guideline for those who dare to travel on the dark side of the road			2
the @entity364 and police boat is at 39/8 @entity428 , @entity429 , in @entity353 ; +66 81 442 5660			0
the @entity430 is located in the village of @entity371 , about 30 kilometers north of @entity353 .			0

dark tourism is gaining ground as more travelers seek out authentic experiences
establishment of the @entity65 has given the genre newfound respectability
sites in @entity90 include @entity206 's @entity205 , @entity149 tsunami memorials , ' haunted ' @entity443
