-- she 's got nerves of steel , golf talent beyond her tender years , and a precocious flair for eye - catching fashion : 11 - year - old @entity11 , the youngest qualifier in @entity8 history , looked entirely at home as she teed - off at @entity13			1
despite a three bad holes in @entity15 , which meant she finished her round with an eight - over - par 78 , @entity11 impressed onlookers with a composed round that saw her bounce back quickly from disappointing shots			1
she left the course smiling , having followed up two double - bogeys and a triple - bogey with assured play -- including birdies at the first and fifth			1
" it was great , " @entity11 told reporters thursday			2
" what i was so happy about in my round , ( was that ) after i got doubles and triples , i was able to get it back			0
and i got a lot of pars after that			0
" heading into the tournament , @entity11 said her only ambition was to " have fun and play the best i can			1
" but the @entity41 native can also count growing experience in her time at @entity13 , not least how to deal with the perilous course -- which hosted the men 's @entity44 last week			0
" it 's tough , " said @entity11			1
" you miss the ball by three feet and it could be like a two - or three - shot difference			1
" you could hit it three feet more right and you 'd be putting this far away for birdie			0
or you could be in the bunker and struggling for a bogey			0
" tour pros had raised doubts about whether the child amateur -- still wearing braces and standing on a box to address the media after her opening round -- should be subjected to the pressure and expectation of such a big professional event			2
" when i found out she qualified , i said , ' well , where does she go from here ? you qualify for an @entity8 at 11 , what do you do next ? ' " asked world no. 1 @entity71 on wednesday			1
the 29 - year - old added : " if it was my kid , i would n't let her play in the @entity44 qualifier at 11 , but that 's just me			1
" pressure seemed to be the least of @entity11 's worries as she chatted with the older members of her playing group and feasted on an ice cream during the post-round press conference			2
" she is so mature for her age , " said 23 - year - old @entity84 , who played with @entity11 and @entity85 -- the latter also shot 78			1
" there were times when i felt more immature than she is			0
@entity85 and i had fun talking to her			0
she 's so mature , it 's like talking to another 23 - year - old			2
" @entity11 became officially the youngest player to qualify after securing her place at an event at @entity98 near her home in @entity41			2
she beats fellow @entity101 @entity100 , who qualified for the @entity102 aged 12 , to become the youngest qualifier			1
but @entity11 is not the youngest to compete at the tournament -- @entity105 competed in 1967 , without having to qualify , aged just 10			2
while @entity106 carded 74 to be on course to make the halfway cut , seven shots behind first - round leader @entity110 , @entity11 and @entity85 were outside the projected top - 60 ahead of their second rounds friday			1
and there was n't a fairytale end for @entity11 -- she missed the weekend rounds after carding another 78 on friday , laced with more highs and lows as she tied for 120th in the 154 - player field			1
" i 'm really happy with how i bounced back from the big numbers , " said @entity11 , who again had to stand on a box to reach the microphone at her press conference friday			2
" just be patient and not care about what happened , just go to the next shot and hit it like nothing , like it 's the first shot			0
" her caddy @entity127 added : " she proved that she deserved to be here			0
her play spoke for itself			0
" it was never about score , " he said			0
" she was here for the experience and the opportunity to play with the best players in the world			0
she proved that she can			0
" the weekend attention switched from one child prodigy to a former one , as @entity140 claimed a three - shot lead from @entity100			1
the 24 - year - old @entity140 also came to prominence at a young age but is still seeking her first major title			2
she birdied the last two holes to move clear of 19 - year - old @entity100 , who at 16 was the youngest winner of an @entity147 event until that record was taken by @entity149 in 2012			0
@entity151 's @entity150 , now 17 , fired 71 to move up the leaderboard and make the cut , being tied for 29th			0
world no. 1 @entity71 dropped from the opening - round lead to a tie for third after a 73 which left the @entity101 four shots behind compatriot @entity140 .			1

@entity11 , 11 , becomes the youngest qualifier to play in @entity101 women 's @entity8 history
@entity11 records opening eight - over - par 78 , after two double - bogeys and a triple - bogey
@entity101 misses the halfway cut after carding another 78 on friday
