-- @entity1 had another debate saturday night in which he did n't make many mistakes , was smooth , knowledgeable , even presidential			1
it was his worst performance yet			0
the game has changed , and someone forgot to tell him			0
he is behind in national polls , and this time it 's serious : his main rival , @entity12 , is polling well not just in @entity13 , but also across the country			1
saturday night 's debate was on a major network , with a wide audience , in the first state in the nation to hold a caucus -- and there is only one more debate before that voting			2
let me reiterate something i 've said before ( it ca n't be overstated ) : your debating strategy must change based on your position			2
if the debate team i coach is a heavy favorite in a debate , i coach the debaters to keep doing the same things that made them the favorite			0
but if we 're an underdog , we will approach the debate with an entirely different argumentative strategy			2
@entity1 is still debating the way he was six months ago			2
he 's debating not to lose instead of debating to win			2
and that 's a mistake , given the rise and potential staying power of @entity45			1
@entity1 committed three major errors in saturday evening 's debate			1
and what is maddening is that they were all opportunities for him to differentiate himself from @entity45 -- but he failed each time			1
the first error was when @entity52 directed a possible bonanza question to @entity1			2
he asked @entity54 if he was more conservative ( his potential weakness ) and more electable ( his potential strength ) than @entity45			2
in one answer , @entity1 could erase doubts about his conservatism for the base of @entity63 voters and he could talk about how he is the only candidate who can beat @entity64 ( as evidenced in polls )			1
@entity1 's answer ? moon mining			1
after starting with some generic answer about the direction of the country , his first specific example was that he was different from @entity45 on moon colonies			2
" we could start with his idea to have a lunar colony that would mine minerals from the moon			0
i 'm not in favor of spending that kind of money to do that			0
" that was his " go to " answer			0
@entity1 never mentioned his conservative principles or background , and he never attacked @entity45 on electability			1
@entity1 's second mistake was that he was shallow when he should have been on the attack			1
@entity45 recently said the @entity92 were an " invented " people			2
while @entity1 held his own in an exchange on this issue , saying he was not a rhetorical " bomb thrower " who would hurt our allies , he did not take the argument as far as he should have			0
one of @entity45 's perceived weaknesses is his imprudence , rhetorical and otherwise			1
@entity1 could have hammered home an argument that @entity45 would be a poor chief statesman because of his often - inappropriate outspokenness			1
finally , when the other candidates teamed up on both @entity45 and @entity1 , as they did with health care ( @entity110 's new angle of attack for the evening was calling the two " @entity54 " ) , @entity1 needed to immediately separate himself from @entity45			1
why ? if @entity45 is leading , and the voters think he and @entity54 are identical , then why would they vote for @entity1 ? they would n't			1
but @entity1 did n't ever get the separation he needed			1
the teamwork was effective , and both @entity45 and @entity1 were grouped together time and time again			1
this did not help @entity1			0
for his part , @entity45 seemed to escape the other candidates ' criticism , partly because it was split ( some attacks were aimed at @entity1 ) , and because the discussion did not stay on one topic for long enough to make @entity45 defend his positions in depth			1
he was able to get out his front line of debate answers , and that was good enough to get him by without too much damage			0
in any form of debate , if you want your attacks to stick , you must stay with them for an extended period of time so you can rebut the answer of the opponent you are attacking			0
this did not happen last night , and is one of the weaknesses of these presidential debates			0
but @entity45 was far from passive , stepping up repeatedly to attack			0
a favorite line : " i am a @entity145 , i 'm proud to be a @entity145			0
i will tell the truth even at the risk of causing some confusion , sometimes with the timid			0
" that 's what the @entity63 are looking for			0
they want tough conservative talk and someone who can take the fight to @entity64			0
@entity45 behaved as though he was ready and willing to do so			1
and @entity1 missed his chance in this debate			1
there is only one more debate before the new year and before the voting begins in @entity13			1
i would suggest @entity1 take a serious look at changing his approach			0
staying the course might feel safe , but it is no longer a winning strategy			0
sometimes you risk everything when you refuse to take risks			0
does @entity1 really want to bet the nomination on the hopes that @entity45 will implode ? ( he really needs to stop betting in these debates , by the way			1
a $ 10,000 bet he offered to @entity175 , over @entity175 's accusation that he 'd excised one of his positions from a later edition of his book , could not have helped him in the heartland			0
) debating not to lose is perhaps the riskiest thing @entity1 can do at this point			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			0

@entity186 : @entity1 had a bad debate in @entity13 , did n't seem to know he 's trailing in polls
he says @entity1 needed new strategy , but he blew chances to go after front - *runner* @entity45
when other candidates attacked him and @entity45 , @entity1 failed to differentiate himself
@entity186 : @entity45 acted ready to take on @entity64 ; @entity1 acted as if he were trying not to lose
