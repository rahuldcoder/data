-- the second cut in @entity3 interest rates in as many weeks is putting further pressure on the members of the @entity6 to reconsider their currencies ' peg with the dollar ; and none more so than @entity11			1
@entity11 prime minister @entity12 tells @entity13 @entity11 has not made any decisions regarding dropping the dollar - peg			1
the small emirate has the highest inflation rate in the region , and it threatens to spiral further northward as its government brings @entity11 interest rates into line with the @entity3 the @entity22 lopped half a percentage off its deposit rate after the @entity25 sought to stave off recession in the @entity3 with an emergency cut of 75 percentage points on january 22			1
eight days later , the @entity25 moved again , this time with a cut of half a percentage point to take @entity3 interest rates to three percent			2
after the first cut , @entity13 's @entity31 sat down for an exclusive television interview with @entity11 's prime minister , @entity34 , who is also the emirate 's foreign minister , and controls @entity11 's sovereign wealth fund through the @entity37 ( @entity37 )			1
@entity31 started by asking @entity12 whether the sharp decline in @entity3 interest rates was putting too much pressure on @entity11 's dollar - peg			1
( ha ) : oil and gas are saleable in dollars , but most of our imports are not in dollars but in euros or @entity48 currencies			1
all of these currencies went 40 percent to 50 percent above the level which we experienced two years ago			2
for us , there is a pressure			0
we know that a decision needs to be made by the @entity25 because of the situation on the stock market in the @entity3 ; it might be a wise decision			1
but for countries like the @entity6 and @entity11 , especially @entity11 , it puts us under pressure on how to deal with inflation and our currency , which is undervalued already by at least 35 percent			1
( @entity62 ) : what is your instinct telling you , to go to a basket of currencies to buffer this fall of the dollar ? ( ha ) : we are studying all options at the moment , but what i can say is that at the @entity6 meetings in december the agreement was to hold onto the dollar and to see			1
every country has to see its way out of this , but only after a consultation with the @entity6			0
for us , our wish is that it 's a policy to be taken by the whole @entity6 , to either basket or revalue our currency			0
i can not see a decision			1
even in @entity11 , we have no decision up to now			1
( @entity62 ) : at the december meeting there was a commitment to move forward with the single currency , realistically by 2010 , or is that just a target ? ( ha ) : it 's just a target			0
i do n't think we will reach that target			2
( @entity62 ) : what is a realistic timeline ? ( ha ) : well , first we need all of us to agree			0
most of the @entity6 countries agree about the currencies but we would like to do it together , and some would like to wait			0
we can not put a target on when it will be done			0
( @entity62 ) : president @entity105 , during his swing through the @entity104 , was asking the producers to put more oil on the market because of the @entity3 recession that may be pending			2
is it time for @entity111 to put more crude oil onto the market ? ( ha ) : is there is excess oil to be put on the market ? i am not sure there is more oil			2
i think all countries at the moment are pumping their capacity , if we are talking in real terms			2
if we are just telling the market there is some excess if something happens , then that is another situation			0
in my opinion everyone is at full speed , enjoying high prices , but there is no excess capacity immediately			1
maybe there is 200,000 to 300,000 extra with one of the producers , but no more than that			0
( @entity62 ) : we have seen oil stabilize around $ 80 per barrel right now			1
that seems to be the new floor			0
can we get to $ 100 per barrel and use that as a new floor within the next 12 months ? ( ha ) : well , anything is possible , but with the slowdown in the @entity3 , and i do n't know what effect in @entity48 , $ 70 or $ 80 is more likely than $ 100 this year			1
unless the situation changes in the economy , which from what we hear can not be changed so quickly			0
( @entity62 ) : we have seen a huge debate over the last four weeks about sovereign wealth funds and president @entity105 has actually gone to put tighter controls and a greater review of these funds			1
do you think it 's correct to provide greater scrutiny to the funds going into the @entity3 and perhaps into @entity162 ? ( ha ) : i 'm surprised about these talks			1
we know these talks were more serious six months ago			2
but after the crisis i think most of the sovereign wealth funds , which have helped in the @entity3 and elsewhere in @entity162 , this has been welcomed by the government			1
they are talking about this fund coming from a different space , from another space , and taking over the market			0
first of all , we are not politically ambitious to play a role in these companies			0
we do not want to take over companies			0
maybe some , but not all			0
( @entity62 ) : i have talked to both the @entity178 and the @entity179 and there is discussion about establishing a set of rules to adhere to for these funds			2
would you go to a set of rules that were international in terms of the outlook as opposed to country by country ? ( ha ) : if it is an international rule done by an international body and consulting all the countries , yes			0
but if there is one country that wants to set its own rules , we will respect their rules as a country , but we have other options to invest somewhere else			0
( @entity62 ) : you have a very good dialogue with the @entity205			0
were you surprised by president @entity105 's actions ? ( ha ) : well , i do n't know exactly what he means by this , but let us wait and see what will come			2

@entity13 speaks exclusively with @entity11 *pm* *sheikh* @entity34
@entity12 says @entity11 has n't made a decision regarding the dollar - peg
*expresses* surprise over talks *suggesting* greater controls on sovereign funds
on oil capacity : " i am not sure there is more oil " , prices of $ 70 - $ *80/bbl* likely
