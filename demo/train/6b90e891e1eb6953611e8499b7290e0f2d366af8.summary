-- wildlife researchers using hidden cameras have captured rare images of snow leopards in a remote mountainous region of @entity6 -- including shots of a cub stealing one of the cameras			1
a research team sponsored by the conservation groups @entity13 ( @entity13 ) and @entity14 set up 11 camera stations in the rugged @entity17 valley near the @entity19 border and left them for three months to record what passed by			2
the cameras are placed in pairs so that they can photograph both sides of the animals , which can be identified by their unique spot patterns , said @entity26 , communications officer for @entity13			2
when researchers went to the sites in the @entity30 nature reserve to retrieve their cameras , which have motion detectors on them to trigger the shutter , they found images showing at least five of the rare cats , including a family with two cubs , @entity13 said in a statement last week			0
but one of the cameras was missing			0
the remaining camera of the pair solved the mystery when its photos showed one of the cubs sniffing , gnawing on and finally ripping the other device from its mounting and running away with it			2
@entity26 speculated that the cub might have been drawn to the slight sounds made by the cameras			1
" the leopards are a bit shy , so whatever drew them , we are really happy with it in the end , " she said			0
the snow leopard is an endangered cat with spotted smoky gray fur that keeps it warm and camouflages it in the remote mountainous regions of @entity65 where it lives			2
they can jump as far as 50 feet and take down prey three times their size , according to the @entity70 website			0
hunting and habitat loss have sharply reduced the numbers of the large feline in recent decades , experts say , with an estimated 4,500 and 7,500 snow leopards left in the wild , scattered across @entity65			1
their populations have declined by as much as 20 % over the past 16 years , the @entity78 says			0
the animal also faces threats from poachers and others who capture the cats for illegal trade			0
their warm pelts bring high prices and their organs are used in traditional @entity91 medicine , the @entity70 website said			1
researchers say even though the @entity30 project revealed new populations of snow leopard , more must be done to ensure their survival			0
" snow leopards have low population densities , which means that large areas need to be protected in order to conserve this species effectively , " said dr. @entity97 of the @entity13			1
" this survey has revealed an unusually high number of snow leopards in the @entity106 , which indicates that this could be a key region for snow leopard conservation			1

there are an estimated 4,500 to 7,500 snow leopards remaining in the wild
the cub may have been drawn to the *noises* the camera made , @entity26 says
the large cat *'s* organs are used in traditional @entity91 medicine
