@entity0 -- when i left @entity4 to move to @entity5 13 years ago , the @entity2 was @entity6 , a man who was often internationally lampooned for mismanaging two wars and tainting @entity9 's image abroad			1
but moving back to @entity4 this month , i 've been struck by the number of @entity4 who look back wistfully at the @entity6 years			2
for @entity4 , @entity6 is considered a better friend than president @entity13			1
in fact , right now , @entity4 do n't see @entity13 as much of a friend at all			1
it did n't start off that way			0
in the early days of his presidency , in 2009 , @entity13 marked @entity4 's @entity18 by saying @entity4 " have no better friend " than the people of the @entity5			1
a year later , when he visited @entity0 , he famously predicted @entity4 and the @entity5 would form " the defining partnership of the 21st century			1
" at the time , @entity13 won @entity4 hearts and minds as he chowed down kebabs at the city 's famous @entity26 restaurant			1
the chefs created a special platter that exists to this day -- the @entity13 platter			2
( there was already a @entity32 platter , as well as a @entity34 one			0
) today , the platters have gone cold : @entity0 feels jilted			0
instead of a defining partnership , @entity4 could n't quite define where they stood			2
talk of a @entity41 -- a @entity5 mega-alliance with @entity43 , an idea which did n't come from @entity13 -- inflamed old feelings of jealousy			1
@entity9 's impending pullout from @entity47 , along with its generous aid to @entity49 , has stoked angst			0
but the real low point was reached late last year when an @entity4 diplomat in @entity53 was arrested and then strip - searched for allegedly underpaying her nanny			1
@entity13 likely had no prior knowledge of the case or the arrest , but still , the perceived @entity5 high - handedness turned out to be too much for @entity4 to digest			1
@entity0 revoked privileges to @entity5 interests in the country , and across @entity4 , there were anti-american protests			1
regardless of the merits of the dispute , @entity4 wondered : if they had no better friend , was this the treatment they deserved ? the sense of betrayal is mutual			2
@entity9 feels let down , too -- and with some good reason			0
when @entity73 annexed @entity74 from @entity75 this year , @entity4 chose not to side with the @entity5 but to abstain on a @entity76 general assembly resolution against the @entity73 action			1
( @entity73 is , incidentally , @entity4 's largest supplier of arms			2
) when @entity9 sought to coalesce support for stringent sanctions against @entity83 , the surprise spoiler turned out to be @entity0 , which said it needed @entity83 oil			2
what happened to what was promised to be a close friendship between the world 's two biggest democracies ? one could look to history for answers			0
since its independence in 1947 , @entity4 -- scarred by centuries of invasions and interventions -- has been a reluctant global player			2
its first prime minister , @entity98 , co-founded the @entity99 , a group of nations that aspired to steer clear of great powers and their geopolitics			0
but 67 years on from its creation , @entity4 is now itself an aspiring great power , already among the top 10 economies in the world			2
@entity4 diplomats routinely express their hopes for @entity4 to become a permanent member of the @entity110 , joining the ranks of @entity73 , the @entity5 , @entity43 , @entity112 and the @entity113			1
and yet @entity4 's foreign policy has remained aloof , lagging well behind its growth			0
the country has about the same number of diplomats abroad as @entity117 , a country with a population 1/250th of @entity4 's			0
the @entity5 , with a population one quarter of @entity4 's , has 10 times as many diplomats			1
how can @entity4 make or maintain friendships when it has always stayed at home ? instead of the past , @entity4 and @entity5 should look to the future and the potential it could bring			1
a recent @entity129 survey shows that despite recent troubles , @entity4 trust and like @entity5			1
for every @entity4 expressing an unfavorable view of the @entity5 , four @entity4 are favorable			1
by another four - to - one margin , @entity4 say the @entity5 is the world 's leading economic power , not @entity43			1
by a margin of 21 percentage points , @entity4 are more favorable to the @entity5 than @entity43			1
the data should not be surprising			0
@entity4 and the @entity5 have more in common than they have differences			1
one may be a parliamentary system , the other presidential , but both celebrate and cherish democracy , however chaotic and frustrating it can be			0
at any given time , nearly 100,000 @entity4 pursue degrees in the @entity5			2
many of them stay on and contribute to @entity5 society and business			0
strategically , as @entity9 competes for influence in @entity151 with @entity43 , it will find a natural ally in @entity0			0
@entity13 's early rhetoric was spot - on : the two countries share common ideals			2
but can they share a friendship and nurture it ? both sides need to take a long , hard look at the world around them and wonder what kind of role they want to play and who can help them do it			0
as @entity4 head to the polls monday to elect a new government , foreign policy is not a campaign issue			0
people tend to vote for the things that tangibly impact them : the economy , taxes , infrastructure , education , health care			0
but whether @entity4 realize it or not , the next few weeks could offer a chance to rejuvenate a troubled relationship			0
whoever @entity4 's next prime minister is , he or she has an opportunity to start afresh with the @entity5			2
@entity9 has already opened a door to this , suggesting that @entity187 , the current favorite for @entity184 , will be allowed a @entity5 visa			0
@entity187 was denied one in 2005 for his alleged complicity in @entity194 - @entity193 riots 12 years ago			0
more than 1,000 muslims were killed			0
@entity187 was chief minister of @entity198 at the time , the state in which the riots took place			0
the last time @entity9 tried to hit the reset button -- with @entity73 -- things went awry			1
but the stakes are too high to not try again			0
if it gets this one right , @entity13 will be vindicated : this century 's defining alliance may yet be the one between the two biggest democracies in the world .			1

president @entity13 predicted @entity5 - @entity4 friendship would be defining alliance of 21st century
@entity4 and @entity5 have been at odds over @entity74 and @entity83 , says @entity214
@entity4 *blames* the @entity5 for the arrest of diplomat whose nanny *complained* of *exploitation*
@entity214 : @entity5 needs to hit reset button and take *advantage* of elections to patch up relations
