is the era of @entity1 upon us ? the government in @entity5 says so , and it 's sinking $ 1.5 billion into upgrades it says will make mobile communications there 1,000 times faster than they are today			1
literally , not so fast			0
as was the case when smartphones and other mobile devices first started having @entity12 slapped on them , the term @entity1 is as much a marketing slogan as anything else -- at this point , anyway			2
and if technophiles in the @entity18 are hoping @entity5 's announcement means warp - speed data connections are coming their way in the near future , they 're going to be disappointed			1
regardless of the network 's capabilities , any wireless carrier wanting to take advantage of them also would need costly upgrades to their systems			2
users would have to purchase new devices that could access it			0
and even then , there 's no guarantee that @entity36 or similar companies would make their own data available at speeds that live up to the @entity5 government 's tantalizing vision of an entire movie downloading in a single second			1
all that said , do n't count @entity5 out			2
arguably the most wired country in the world , @entity5 has led in mobile adoption since the 1990s			2
" we helped fuel national growth with @entity52 services in the 1990s , @entity47 in the 2000s and @entity12 around 2010			0
now it is time to take preemptive action to develop @entity1 , " the nation 's science ministry said			1
" countries in @entity58 , @entity59 and the @entity18 are making aggressive efforts to develop 5g technology ... and we believe there will be fierce competition in this market in a few years			0
" a worldwide high of 82.7 % of @entity5 use the @entity66 , and 78.5 % of the nation 's population is on smartphones			1
narrow that down to 18 - 24 year olds and it 's dangerously close to full saturation -- 97.7 %			0
the science ministry 's plan is realistically measured			1
a trial 5g network is due to be rolled out in 2017 , with full rollout in 2020			0
the country 's telecom companies , as well as native mobile companies @entity81 and @entity82 , are on board and plan to be ready to take advantage of the network , according to the government statement			0
eventually , of course , @entity87 will hit the @entity18 and elsewhere			1
remember , the difference between @entity47 and @entity12 and @entity87 is somewhat semantic			0
significantly upgrade what we have now and you can add a number before the @entity94 but we 'll no doubt be behind			0
@entity5 's compact geography and existing wireless infrastructure mean that upgrades can happen faster and cheaper , and will reach more of the population than in geographically spread - out countries like the @entity18			1
the increasing number of smartphones and tablets used in the @entity18 is already beginning to tax existing communications networks			1
add an emerging wearable tech trend and connected appliances like smart thermostats , refrigerators and smoke detectors , and experts expect the @entity18 will need a serious upgrade by 2020 as well			1
each generation of network technology has enabled a new set of features : @entity52 was about voice , @entity47 was about data and @entity12 is about video			0
@entity87 is expected to be about creating intelligent networks that can handle those billions of connected devices .			2

@entity5 says they 're *spending* $ 1.5 billion on a " @entity87 " network
the term is mostly a slogan for now , but the tech will come
the nation 's science ministry promises new network in 2020
*cellular* networks in the @entity18 likely will *linger* behind
