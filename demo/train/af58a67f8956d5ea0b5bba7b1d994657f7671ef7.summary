-- general @entity2 's own investigation may be over , but @entity4 has just begun			0
@entity0 has learned from @entity6 and @entity7 sources that the @entity8 plans to hold hearings this month on how the automaker allowed fatally flawed ignition switches to remain inside vehicles for years			1
the @entity13 wo n't be far behind			2
sen. @entity14 , @entity15 of @entity16 whose subcommittee is handling the issue , announced thursday that she , too , would hold a hearing this summer			0
the push for hearings is one of many signs that even as @entity24 put its internal investigation to rest thursday , lawmakers have not made up their minds about how the company handled the problem , whether there could be criminal wrongdoing , and what are the company 's responsibilities to victims from its mistake			1
" the conclusion of @entity24 's internal investigation marks an important milestone , " wrote @entity8 chairman @entity36 in a statement released by his office			1
family ' angry ' despite @entity24 firings " but our investigation continues as many questions remain for both the company and the @entity48 , " the @entity44 @entity6 said			1
@entity36 praised an investigative report commissioned by @entity24 and produced by former @entity51 attorney @entity50 as " thorough , " but said that it raised concerns about how the company handled the switch problem			1
@entity24 admitted in february that its engineers first knew of the ignition switch problem as early as 2004			1
but it did not recall some 2.6 million affected vehicles until earlier this year			2
" the initial findings are deeply disturbing , suggesting that communications and management failures ran deep and wide within @entity24 , " he wrote			2
@entity24 estimates that 13 people died as a result of the switch flaw , which made affected cars prone to shutting off while on the road , disabling the airbags , power steering and anti-lock brakes			1
the delayed recall was caused by the misconduct of about 20 employees and " a pattern of incompetence and neglect " throughout the company , the report said			0
@entity24 chief executive officer @entity78 announced that 15 employees had been dismissed and five more were been disciplined following the three - month probe			1
on the @entity13 side , @entity14 sent out a statement saying she is withholding judgment until she can read the report more closely			2
" i 'm looking forward to getting a full briefing from mr. @entity89 , " she wrote , adding a note of scrutiny			0
" i wo n't be letting @entity24 leadership , or federal regulators , escape accountability for these tragedies			2
" the 300 - page @entity24 report is at the top of the heap of a much larger pile of paperwork that congressional investigators are sifting through on the issue			2
the @entity8 says it has received 1 million pages of documents from @entity24 about the ignition switch problem , with some 400,000 pages arriving just in the last week			1
" @entity24 's internal assessment confirms many of the troubling details our ongoing @entity8 investigation is uncovering , " wrote rep. @entity105 of @entity106 , who is the top @entity15 on the @entity8 subcommittee tasked with the @entity24 investigation			1
in a statement , she pointed to some initial conclusions , writing , " siloed responsibilities and a corporate culture that deemphasized safety created an environment that allowed problems to linger , leading to additional accidents and loss of life			0
" @entity105 is particularly watching an issue that @entity24 has not resolved yet : compensation for victims			0
" we also need more details to understand how accident victims may receive compensation from @entity24 as well as what legal rights individuals may have to waive as a condition of payment , " she wrote			0
@entity78 said the company would create a program to compensate those injured or killed by the defective cars , but she did n't say how large that fund would be			0
as @entity8 and @entity13 committees prepare for a busy next month , two members of @entity4 are pushing for something more : a new law			1
" we need to enact legislation that requires auto manufacturers to submit information on possible defects as soon as they become aware of them , " wrote sen. @entity143 , @entity15 of @entity144			0
he and @entity152 @entity7 sen. @entity151 have proposed the " @entity153 of 2014 , " which would require carmakers to automatically submit to @entity48 any accident report involving a fatality , and then it would require the agency make those documents public			0
both sit on the @entity160 , but so far no other senators have signed onto the bill and its future is not clear @entity24 will pay a $ 35 million fine to safety regulators over the switch debacle and is the subject of a federal criminal probe			1
@entity24 also faces wrongful death lawsuits from victims ' families			0
@entity0 's @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this report .			0
