@entity0 -- the tears begin and her voice trembles as @entity5 remembers the first few days of her new world			1
@entity1 's @entity7 talks to @entity5 and her son @entity8			1
she would leave work , pick up her son @entity8 at school and drive aimlessly , sometimes sneaking back to the office , " to watch tv there without my boss knowing			1
" her husband had lost his job , and the stress drove them apart			1
suddenly , her car was her home			1
and she was afraid to ask for help			2
" we just prayed , " @entity5 told us			1
" and i was embarrassed because a @entity25 does not ask for help			2
the way i was raised , you put your pride to the side and did what you had to do			2
" @entity32 finds them in cars , under bridges , in abandoned homes , and even in protected trenches artfully dug by the military veterans who put survival skills learned in @entity40 and @entity41 to use in @entity43 's inner cities			1
@entity32 has been working to help the homeless here for eight years now , driving the streets every day looking for people hiding under bridges and in abandoned properties			1
more and more of late , there are people in business clothes , heading off to work			2
more and more , they are women with young children			1
" in my eight years of doing this i have never come across as many people who 've told us they have never been homeless before , " said @entity32 , the director of community outreach for people assisting the @entity57			1
" it 's quite different from what i have seen in the past			2
" estimates of the problem vary widely			2
a 2007 survey by the @entity67 estimated there were more than 73,000 homeless people in @entity70			1
activists like @entity72 who walk the streets say the number has grown in the past year as the recession has deepened , and that more and more they encounter families			0
the ingredients for this growing problem are a troubling mix : double - digit employment , in the 20 percent or higher range in poorer @entity83 and @entity84 communities , high foreclosure rates and budget cuts to social service programs including homeless assistance			1
" a lot of folks who just recently lost their job , and a few folks that were telling us they were living and paying the rent -- following everything they had to do -- but the owner of the property was foreclosed and they had to be moved out , " @entity32 said			1
" so we 've seen a combination and it 's pretty much balanced between the two right now			0
but we 're seeing more now than i have seen in the past eight years			0
" @entity5 is one of the new faces among the homeless			1
the government told her it could n't help because she had a job and did n't qualify			1
finally , @entity67 , a homeless advocacy group , offered a voucher for a hotel			1
it was , in @entity5 's words , " very , very low class			1
" her purse was stolen			0
drug dealers roamed the grounds			0
but it was a roof over @entity8 's head			0
" i was willing to deal with it because i had nowhere else to go			0
" the agency that gave her the voucher then referred her to people assisting the @entity57 and before too long @entity5 and @entity8 were assigned a room at a @entity70 shelter			1
it is cramped ; bunk beds against the wall and a thin mattress on the floor where @entity8 prefers to sleep			0
" path is an awesome place , " @entity5 tells us after giving us a tour of the shelter , which has a common kitchen area and family room with a single tv , and a small outdoor play area for the children			1
families are in one section , single women another across the hall			1
she has been here six weeks and can stay six months			0
those given rooms must agree to set aside some of their earnings in a savings account to help build enough money to rent an apartment , and there are strict curfews and rules of conduct			0
@entity5 still goes to work every day			1
she still picks up her son at school , and makes sure he keeps his grades up			0
it would n't dawn on any passerby outside that she is homeless -- and she sees a powerful lesson in that			1
" the person next to you at times could be homeless and little do you know that they are			2
so when people see homeless , i wish society would try to help ... i wish society would be more gentle with words sometimes			2
" across town , in a motel whose better days were long ago , @entity172 huddles on one of two twin beds lined against the walls			1
her three daughters sit closely at her side , though the youngest , 3 - year - old @entity182 , from time to time gets up to wander the small room or play with a small stuffed dalmatian			0
" i am homeless because we can not afford an apartment , " @entity185 says			2
" @entity188 is very expensive here			0
" she is divorcing a husband she said was abusive			2
after taking off , he is now paying some child support because of the efforts of the @entity70 district attorney 's office			1
the girls were born in the @entity43 and are citizens , but @entity172 can not work because she is here illegally , applying now for legal status after being told a nonprofit she believed was helping her for years had lost her paperwork			1
at times in the past , she has worked in the underground economy , cleaning homes and doing other odd jobs			2
but a back injury makes that work more difficult , and she says there are fewer jobs because of the economy and more and more prospective employers who demand to see immigration documents			0
" they request all the time for papers to work , " she said			0
" i have been waiting for my immigration papers since 2000 , " she said			0
she could afford a small studio or one - bedroom , but no one will rent such a small place to a family of four , so she lives in a tiny motel room			2
her church is part of her lifeline			0
" they support us spiritually and with pantries for food , " @entity185 said			0
" the church is like our second home and we are so happy there			0
" in june it will be one year in these cramped quarters			0
to cook , the family goes down the hall to a shared kitchen			0
there is just one bathroom for the four of them			0
to bathe or shower , there is an additional , though welcome , complication : two tiny turtles , who spend most of their day wandering the bathtub			0
@entity185 said she will stay here until her immigration status is resolved , and then plans to move to @entity246 where she has friends and relatives , and where she said there are more jobs and a lower cost of living			0
for @entity5 , @entity70 is home , and she hopes by the end of her six months in the people assisting the @entity57 shelter to have set aside enough money to get an apartment			1
still , as urgent as her need to save , she often gives a few dollars away on the ride back to the shelter at night			0
" when i get off the freeway i see a gentleman there all the time , " she said			0
" if i have a couple of dollars i give it to him			0
even though i am homeless , i would rather give the last dollar i have to the person who i see needs it more than me			2

@entity5 worked in an office , but lived in her car
@entity172 left her husband but had no job or place to go
both are being helped by aid agencies in @entity70 , @entity279
