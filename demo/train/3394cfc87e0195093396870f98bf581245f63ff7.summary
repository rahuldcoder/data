-- @entity1 often responded directly to fans and customers by e-mail , which were then posted to blogs , but a curious thing happened after the late @entity8 co-founder resigned in august and quieted his digital communications			1
e-mails from the new ceo , @entity11 , began landing in the inboxes of enthusiastic @entity8 fans and on the same blogs that followed @entity1 ' every word			1
@entity11 replied to several people who sent notes of congratulations			1
" thanks @entity19 , " he told @entity19 , who blogs for @entity20 in @entity21			0
" thanks @entity22 , " he told @entity22 of @entity23 , @entity24			0
@entity11 graduated from @entity25 and is known to be a fan of its sports teams			2
so when an apparent graduate of his alma mater sent @entity11 a congratulatory e-mail , he responded : " @entity32			2
@entity33 ! " like @entity1 before him , @entity11 has also started handling customer - relations inquiries			2
one person e-mailed @entity11 bemoaning the loss of file - and - preference synchronization in the transition from internet services @entity41 to @entity42			2
the message was forwarded to the executive relations team that @entity1 regularly tapped for similar e-mails , and a representative responded by calling the sender and explaining that @entity8 is open to bringing those features back if the company receives enough feedback requesting them			1
@entity52 - based blogger @entity51 offered @entity11 a line of unsolicited advice when @entity1 ' deputy was named as @entity8 's chief			1
" i honestly have no recollection of sending this email ( to @entity11 )			0
it was actually a really stupid thing for me to write , " @entity51 wrote on his blog afterward			0
" i 'm totally qualified to be giving advice to the new ceo of one of the largest tech companies in the world , right ? " what @entity66 wrote in his e-mail was this : " do n't be @entity1 , be @entity11			1
" to his surprise , @entity11 wrote back			0
he replied : " do n't worry			0
