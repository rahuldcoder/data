-- mullah @entity1 , the @entity3 @entity2 commander whose capture was made public this week , is one of the most senior figures in the movement to be seized -- second only to @entity2 leader @entity8			1
@entity1 was @entity3 's deputy defense minister when the @entity2 controlled the country , according to the @entity11 committee in charge of sanctions on @entity14 and @entity2 members			1
in recent years , he has been a senior military commander and a member of the @entity2 's governing @entity17 , the committee said			1
he has been " very much in control of the military operation in @entity3 , responsible for appointing the commanders " on the ground , said @entity23 , executive director of the @entity25 , a think tank focusing on security			1
" @entity1 is known to have had a very close relationship with @entity29 in the past , " @entity27 said			1
" if anyone would know where the senior leaders are of @entity14 and the @entity2 , then @entity1 is someone who would be privy to that kind of information			1
" @entity36 blog : more on @entity1 and the @entity2 it was critical to keep his capture secret at first , @entity27 said			1
it is not clear exactly when he was detained in the @entity41 city of @entity42			2
but @entity43 , director of analysis at the @entity46 think tank , said she doubted he could lead the @entity48 straight to those who are most wanted			0
" it 's not like you have one guy , and that immediately opens the door to everyone else , " she said , adding that the @entity2 guard information carefully because the militant group knows its members could be captured			1
@entity1 was cagey about his contacts with his superior in an interview that @entity62 magazine said it conducted with him by e-mail last year			0
asked if he was " in direct contact with @entity8 , " he responded , " continuous contacts are not risk - free because of the situation			0
[ but we ] get his advice on important topics			0
" he appeared to consider the possibility of breaking ties between the @entity2 and @entity14 if it would get the @entity72 out of @entity3			1
" our decisions are made on the basis of our national interests , " @entity1 said , according to @entity62			0
he could be replaced by a more radical figure , said @entity78 analyst @entity77			0
" @entity79 is actually notorious because he was in @entity80 for six years , and then he was released and immediately returned to @entity3 and rejoined the @entity2 , " @entity77 said			2
" he left @entity80 very much more radicalized , and i think @entity79 is actually much more radical than @entity1 , and much more dogmatic and much more in the @entity14 mindset			0
" @entity46 's @entity43 said the capture could be important for what it shows about @entity72 - @entity41 ties , regardless of its effects on the battlefield or the hunt for @entity29			1
" it 's hard to believe that this will lead to this huge intelligence coup , but if the @entity41 are shifting their mode of cooperating [ with the @entity72 ] that is significant , " @entity43 said			1
" @entity41 did n't do this for free -- they are going to be asking for some very concrete concessions " from the @entity72 , she said			2
she noted reports that @entity1 represented @entity8 in secret negotiations brokered by @entity99			0
" @entity1 is one of the main mediators , " she said			0
@entity41 's cooperation with the @entity72 in capturing him may be its way of telling @entity103 to deal with @entity104 -- not @entity99 -- if it wants to negotiate with the @entity3 @entity2 , she said			1
" the @entity99 have been very involved in back - channel talks , and @entity41 wants to show it is the only one that has the real leverage and intelligence to wield carrots and sticks , " she said			2
it is not clear that the @entity99 - brokered talks are still going on			0
" the @entity2 leadership through @entity1 engaged with the @entity99 by conducting talks with @entity99 intelligence chief , @entity119 , " @entity115 of the @entity116 wrote last week			2
" these talks came to an abrupt halt when in mid- 2009 , prince @entity119 was told point - blank that @entity8 decided to discontinue all negotiations [ since he ] took it as an affront that on the one hand @entity103 aimed to engage the @entity2 through @entity99 , while on the other hand it planned to continue all efforts to defeat the @entity2 through its troop surge and drone strikes , " @entity115 wrote in " @entity99 , @entity41 and prospects for peace with the @entity2			1
" the @entity133 , or @entity133 , must have known @entity1 's location and turned a blind eye for some time , @entity43 said			2
" he was hanging out in southern @entity42 with @entity133 knowledge			0
he was n't really posing a threat to @entity41 , " she said			0
@entity1 has been under @entity11 sanctions since february 2001 , with his assets frozen and travel banned			0
the @entity11 also forbids selling weapons to him			0
he was born around 1968 in the village of @entity143 in @entity3 's @entity145 province , according to the world body			2
" @entity1 , " which means brother in @entity3 's @entity151 language , appears to be a nickname			1
@entity0 's @entity155 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
