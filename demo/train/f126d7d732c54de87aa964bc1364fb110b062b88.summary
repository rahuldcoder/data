-- gun control supporting candidates facing tight races for governor in @entity5 and @entity6 are the beneficiaries of a last - minute ad buy from former @entity10 mayor @entity9			1
@entity9 's group , @entity9 , is supporting pro-gun control candidates like @entity14 gov. @entity13 in @entity5 and @entity14 lieutenant governor @entity15 in @entity6 , both of whom are locked in tight races to lead their states			1
gun control is a " simmering issue " in these states , said @entity24 spokesman @entity23			2
historically , the @entity25 has donated to both democrats and @entity27 supporting " common sense " gun control in an attempt to stave off the gun lobby and tie pro-gun candidates to the @entity33			1
in @entity5 , the group hopes that support for gun control will emerge as a salient theme for voters in the wake of the state 's @entity40 in december 2012 , where 20 young children and 6 adults were shot and killed at an elementary school			1
the newest ads there target @entity48 's opponent , @entity27 challenger @entity47			1
" the @entity33 praises @entity47 , calling him pro-gun , " a voice in a new @entity5 ad says			1
the @entity33 opposes comprehensive background checks			2
and @entity47 promised he 'd sign a bill to weaken them , undermining our gun safety laws			2
" the @entity47 campaign did not immediately return @entity0 's request to respond to @entity24 's efforts			0
this is the second ad buy in @entity5 in the past week : television watchers also might have noticed another gun control ad which launched friday from the group			1
@entity23 said these ad buys represent an attempt to make sure gun control stays on the agenda in these states			1
" the public safety bills that were passed in the wake of the @entity40 massacre -- which have overwhelming support -- are an issue for discussion , " @entity23 said			0
" one of the things that @entity77 is able to do is help highlight issues particularly in expensive media markets like @entity10 that might otherwise get swept under the rug			0
" the group has plans to spend $ 1.7 million in the state in its support for @entity48 , who signed a gun control law in 2013 which expanded background checks and banned sales of some weapons like the @entity92 semiautomatic rifle , which was used in the @entity40 massacre			1
@entity47 took a stand against @entity48 's measures in an august gubernatorial debate , calling his moves " grandstanding " and " overreaching			2
" he has also said he would repeal @entity48 's gun control legislation			2
four years ago , @entity48 narrowly fended off @entity47 by less than one percentage point in their 2010 battle for the governor 's office			0
the candidates are tied in the most recent poll from @entity108 / @entity107 / @entity106			0
in @entity6 , @entity15 holds a substantial lead over his opponent , @entity27 @entity110			0
but the race has drawn the attention of national headliners : @entity27 @entity115 gov. @entity114 has stumped in the state for @entity110 , while top democrats like president @entity118 and the @entity119 have appeared for @entity15			0
@entity9 -- a noted philanthropist and media magnate boasting a net worth of $ 34 billion -- has pledged to spend $ 25 million through his political action committee to raise awareness on gun control across the country			1
shortly after the @entity40 shootings , he made a sizable donation to @entity129 , a fundraising group run by former rep. @entity130			0
the former congresswoman survived gun wounds to her head after an attempted assassination attempt in january 2011			0
with polling places officially open in @entity5 and @entity6 in just a week , @entity24 's group is focused on @entity137			0
" we take these elections one at a time , " @entity23 said .			0
