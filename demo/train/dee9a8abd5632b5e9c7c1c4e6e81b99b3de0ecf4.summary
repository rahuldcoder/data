on the brink of freedom			0
converted to @entity2 and married off ... despite the claims and counterclaims the fate of more than 200 girls kidnapped by @entity7 on april 14 remains as unclear as ever			1
on october 17 , @entity9 officials announced they had reached a ceasefire deal with @entity7 that included the girls ' release			1
@entity13 , principal secretary to president @entity14 said the deal followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group in @entity19			0
" we have agreed on the release of the @entity23 schoolgirls , and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group 's representative next week in @entity19 , " he said			1
the announcement revived hopes the girls ' would be released and reawakened the # @entity31 hashtag on @entity32			2
but analysts questioned the veracity of the government 's claim and @entity7 remained silent on the ceasefire -- and active in northeastern @entity9 , where it carried out more attacks and abductions			1
finally , on november 1 , a video appeared of the group 's leader , @entity42 saying no ceasefire been reached			1
as for the girls , @entity42 said they had converted to @entity2 and had been married off , saying with a chuckle in the video : " they are in their marital homes			1
" so did @entity9 's government truly believe it had reached a truce with @entity7 ? @entity53 's @entity52 has covered the girls ' abduction since they were taken from @entity23 and traveled to @entity9 after last month 's announcement they were to be released			1
@entity52 says indications are that talks certainly had been taking place			0
" from people i 've spoken to on the ground , it does seem that there was some effort under way to free the girls , " she said			0
but @entity52 says some sources believe the @entity9 government may have been dealing with the wrong people			2
in an article for @entity53 last week , analyst @entity71 also pointed out that many @entity9 journalists had questioned whether the man said to be negotiating on behalf of @entity7 's leadership was a genuine representative of the group			1
in his video , @entity42 certainly indicated that he was not , denying knowing the man and adding : " we will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him			1
" after the @entity7 leader 's message , @entity9 's government again reiterated that negotiations had taken place , saying @entity42 's comments contradicted assertions made in conversations with @entity9 officials			1
" we 've heard about the video , and we can say the road to peace is bumpy -- and you can not expect otherwise , " a spokesman said			0
" @entity9 has been fighting a war , and wars do n't end overnight			2
" what clues are there as to the girls ' whereabouts ? this is the crucial unanswered question			0
@entity53 's @entity103 visited @entity23 in may and met with a girl who had managed to flee from @entity7 the night of the abduction			1
the girl told @entity107 how she made a dash for freedom after militants loaded them into trucks and drove them into the nearby @entity113			0
president @entity14 also said the girls were in the forest , which at that time was an @entity7 stronghold			1
@entity52 says that belief had persisted for a long time but the militants -- and therefore the girls -- were no longer thought to be in that area			0
" the feeling among @entity9 government officials i have spoken to is that the girls were broken into groups and have been dispersed along the @entity19 , @entity128 and @entity129 borders -- that they 're in those border areas , " she said			1
what about @entity42 's claim the girls have been married off ? on october 27 , @entity134 ( @entity134 ) released a report on @entity7 violence against women and girls in @entity9 after interviewing kidnap victims including 12 of the @entity23 girls			1
" the victims were held in eight different @entity7 camps that they believed to be in the 518 - square - kilometer @entity144 and around the @entity146 hills for periods ranging from two days to three months , " the report said			2
" the women and girls told @entity134 that for refusing to convert to @entity2 , they and many others they saw in the camps were subjected to physical and psychological abuse ; forced labor ; forced participation in military operations , including carrying ammunition or luring men into ambush ; forced marriage to their captors ; and sexual abuse , including rape			2
" @entity134 documented eight cases of sexual violence by @entity7 combatants saying " most cases of rape occurred after the victims were forced to marry			2
" @entity52 said the report suggest that the girls have likely been married off to @entity7 combatants , who are believed to number around 10,000			1
" if indeed @entity42 's statements are true , it 's probably likely that they have been married to @entity7 fighters or to @entity7 supporters , " she said			1
who would fight for @entity7 ? @entity134 said witnesses had described the abduction of men and boys -- especially those of fighting age -- by @entity7			2
" the men and boys are often given the option of joining the group or being killed			0
other men appeared to have been targeted for abduction because of their specific skills or occupation , which filled a need in the insurgents ' camp , " the group said in its october report			0
but not all combatants are forced			0
" one thing that i keep hearing when i 'm in @entity9 is the question of ' who is @entity7 ? ' says @entity52			1
" is it ideologues ? is it young people from those very communities who are almost like mercenaries who become involved because they are going to be paid and make some money ? " according to some security experts i spoke to they 're not all @entity9 , some of them are from those neighboring countries and some of them are paid fighters			2
" where does support for the group come from ? the notion of support for @entity7 is complicated , says @entity52			2
" when @entity7 first sprang up , they rose with an agenda of trying to address the inequality between the @entity221 north -- which has been under invested in and has high levels of poverty and lower levels of education -- and the rest of the country			2
it was about social ills -- that 's what they originally came onto the scene professing			0
" but in 2009 , the struggle became violent			0
police killed @entity7 's founder @entity235 , and he was replaced by current leader @entity42			1
" when they were a ' social ills campaign , ' so to speak , they had some amount of support among ordinary @entity9 who felt that here were people who were speaking out on their behalf , saying they needed more support from the government and they 'd been long ignored , " @entity52 said			0
" things took a turn when they became a violent extremist group that began smashing and burning and murdering people			0
and i think in the north east -- particularly in those three states that are under a state of emergency -- it 's just fear -- it 's just absolute fear			0
" people have fled their homes , there are large camps for internally displaced persons camps scattered around the country with thousands of people in them			0
" the instability that this has brought to the north in terms of its economy and its day - to - day life ca n't even be quantified			0
so i think by and large in the north , i do n't hear of civilian support for @entity7			0

@entity9 's claim of a truce with @entity7 raised hopes for release of kidnapped girls
but @entity7 's leader @entity42 issued a video denying any ceasefire
@entity42 said he did not know the negotiator claiming to represent @entity7
the girls kidnapped from @entity23 , he said , had converted to @entity2 and been married off
