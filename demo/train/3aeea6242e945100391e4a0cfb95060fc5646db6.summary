has the derring - do and moxie to turn her back on the audience that first brought her fame , some years ago , and meet them again , those same people			1
only it 's years later , and now they 're grownups			2
holding their own credit cards , at the ready for this new book			0
there is never a vacancy in the world of writers of books for the grownup market or the preteen mob			0
there is a surfeit of writers working hard , thanklessly			0
and when a @entity33 or a @entity34 dies , such quieter and under - appreciated writers note that geniuses leave a permanent loss , not a casual vacancy to be filled			0
so while i have not yet read @entity3 's book			1
i admire that she has decided to try her hand at wooing world - weary grownups			0
she need n't have , of course			0
she could have stood and blown 100 - pound notes ( in @entity49 sterling ) out her bagpipe in that castle in @entity52 from now till her dying day and never noticed the difference			1
she must be writing because she needs to write			2
now , truth to tell , it 's far more common in the @entity49 for writers to shift audiences , adults to children or vice versa			1
@entity62 wrote a few picture books			0
@entity64 has written fantasies for children			2
@entity66 was a scholar and popular theologian long before he mapped out @entity68 and @entity69 , famously , a philologist and medievalist before he discovered the common hobbit			0
@entity3 shows why muggles obsessed with class but in the @entity77 , writers for children tend to do little else			1
when someone not primarily driven to write for children does venture into the field from the great beyond , he or she is usually slumming , dallying from the field of entertainment or sometimes politics , which is another kind of entertainment , just less funny			2
most often , these books are n't very good			0
in the @entity77 , adults who begin writing for children and then turn to writing for adults -- successfully -- are few and far between			1
( i am one of them ; i think that because " wicked " was based on a children 's classic , it allowed me to slip the ropes of convention			2
) such a conversion to being a writer for adults after a novitiate as a writer for children is more common in @entity104			1
think of @entity105 , who first won the @entity106 for a children 's book and a few years later was shortlisted for the @entity108 for an adult novel			1
they move back and forth between the audiences with ease			0
there 's no reason to think @entity3 ca n't do the same			1
by and large , the @entity49 do n't sentimentalize childhood the way @entity77 tend to -- at least , not since the @entity121 brought an end to @entity123 and @entity124 and other @entity49 nationals who no longer could fly over central @entity126 with impunity and song			1
so @entity3 , from a tradition of starch and stiff - upper - lip , should have every advantage			1
@entity104 made her keen , and the world made her rich			0
she 's too smart to be self - adoring or self - indulgent , so she wo n't fall into that trap			1
we 'll find out soon enough whether her new effort will be a memorable book -- but it wo n't be a weak one , i bet , for it 's been prompted by nothing more urgent than a need to write or die			2
@entity3 's ' the @entity4 ' -- snobbery , sex and scheming @entity144 thought , though : no one who really gets the density and elegance and mystery of childhood is unprepared to write for adults			1
by comparison , the adult audience is easier to satisfy than the child audience			2
adults have picked up the habit of patience			0
they understand the concept of delayed gratification and so can be tricked into investment in page after page , waiting for the payoff			0
for their part , children are by nature fickle , distractible , alert , compulsive			0
if they are n't wooed and won early on , they toss the book @entity169 gave them right into the rubbish bin and sally out the door			0
writing for children -- succeeding at writing for children -- is much harder than writing for adults , and an excellent internship besides			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2

@entity177 : @entity3 has moxie , derring - do to *reunite* with her readers as adults
he says she does n't need the money , she 's written her new novel out of a need to write
*toggling* between adult and youth writing more common in @entity49 , less so in @entity77 , he says
@entity177 : writing for children is excellent way to start ; they are a more demanding audience
