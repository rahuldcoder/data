-- the translation of the voice below the macabre @entity4 video clip reads , " look at the bruises on his face along with his broken neck			1
" the clip is a two and a half minute gruesome catalogue of wounds on a 13 - year - old child 's body			1
on april 29 , demonstrators from villages surrounding @entity19 , @entity20 , marched on the city in an attempt to break the @entity20 military siege there			2
their intent was to bring in much - needed supplies , including milk for babies and crucial medicines			0
at the time , the crackdown on @entity19 was so intense eyewitnesses spoke of bodies bloating in the streets and the injured being treated at makeshift secret clinics to avoid detection by the @entity20 security forces			2
on that day , eyewitnesses say , security forces fired indiscriminately on them , killing and wounding dozens			0
countless others were detained in a mass roundup			0
among them , says his family , was @entity16			2
he got separated from his father in the chaos			0
a month later , the family received his body			0
the video was taken at that time by a relative , the family says			0
much of the video of the child 's corpse is too graphic to broadcast			0
his face is bloated and purple			0
his body is covered in bruises			0
there are gunshot wounds to his torso and his genitals are mutilated			0
@entity0 can not independently verify what happened to @entity16 or the authenticity of the video			1
@entity16 's family was threatened after the video was initially broadcast by other outlets , intermediaries told @entity0 , and they became too petrified to talk about what happened , even to close friends			1
@entity70 , a prominent activist in hiding in @entity20 who @entity0 reached via @entity71 , said she has no doubt that it is real			1
and she believes that the regime had a message in releasing the boy 's body			0
" they want the people to see this , they want the people to get scared , " @entity70 said			2
" they want the people to know that there is no red line and anything , no matter how awful it is , could happen to their family members if they continue to participate in this revolution			0
" but far from terrorizing people , the video appears to have made them only bolder			2
every family , every single family in @entity20 felt , even if they were not directly with the revolution , they felt that @entity16 is their own son , " @entity70 explained			1
more demonstrations erupted across @entity20 , with crowds chanting @entity16 's name			1
according to the video posted on @entity4 , men in the @entity102 countryside chanted , " faithful brothers , do not forget that your sons could become @entity16 , " while in central @entity20 demonstrators chanted , " with our blood and our souls we will defend you @entity16 " even children took to the streets , risking a similar fate , vowing that @entity16 's blood was not spilled in vain			1
in reaction , @entity20 state tv on tuesday ran a segment in which a person identified as the medical examiner in the case said the body 's injuries were sustained when the boy was alive , but there was no evidence on the surface of the body that the boy had been subjected to torture , violence or retaliation			1
the medical examiner said proper procedures to identify the body were followed after the body first arrived , and went on to describe how a body deteriorates in phases after death , turning dark brown , for example , with parts becoming enlarged			1
the boy 's death , he said , was the result of the three gunshot wounds he sustained			0
@entity146 also said @entity147 met with members of @entity16 's family on tuesday , and it showed men it identified as the boy 's father and uncle , who said that @entity147 was very welcoming and understanding , and promised reform			2
but in @entity159 , the reports about @entity16 's fate drew strong words from @entity162 secretary of state @entity161 on tuesday			1
in response to a question about @entity20 from @entity0 , she said she was " very concerned with reports about the young boy			2
" " in fact , i think what that symbolizes for many @entity20 is the total collapse of any effort by the @entity20 government to work with and listen to their own people , " she said			1
" ... i can only hope that this child did not die in vain , but that the @entity20 government will end the brutality and begin the transition to a real democracy			2
" she added , " every day that goes by the position of the government becomes less tenable and the demands of the @entity20 people only grow stronger			1
" activists say they are not surprised that the regime could have committed the kind of cruelty the @entity4 video allegedly shows , and they claim that it is not the first time a child has been targeted			1
another video posted to @entity4 claims to show an 11 - year - old child who was shot in his home			1
another clip shows people trying to recover the body of a child in a street amid intense gunfire			1
and another shows children lying wounded in a hospital after security forces allegedly fired on their bus			0
activists say these types of atrocities have been committed against the population for decades now by a regime that does n't differentiate between ages			0
the difference now , they say , is that it is being talked about			0
@entity16 's death has prompted an international outrage			0
a @entity215 page calling itself " we are all the martyr , the child @entity16 " had 60,000 followers by tuesday			0
the face of this 13 - year - old from a village in southern @entity20 is now the symbol of an uprising .			1

the body of @entity16 , 13 , shows *horrible* injuries in a @entity4 video
" they want the people to see this , they want the people to get scared , " an activist says
instead , people " got angrier , " says the activist , who is in hiding in @entity20
@entity20 state tv : the medical examiner says there was no evidence of torture
