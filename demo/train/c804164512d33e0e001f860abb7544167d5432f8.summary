-- a little more than two months ago , i stood on a @entity3 beach , tears streaming down my cheeks as i watched members of the 2012 @entity8 team cross the finish line of the @entity10			1
a year before they had never worn a pair of running shoes , let alone a triathlon suit			2
for many of them completing a triathlon was utterly inconceivable , akin to asking them to walk on the moon			2
but what a difference a year made			2
at the @entity10 , i saw the @entity22 athletes conquer their fears and achieve more than they could have ever imagined			2
their courage , strength , happiness , elation and pride were a beacon that shone for all to see , and that light continues to inspire everyone who shared in their amazing journey			1
it was an absolute privilege to join dr. @entity35 and coach april as a guest coach for the 2012 @entity8 team			1
the finish line was not the end for the @entity22 ; it was just the beginning			1
their journey did not simply bring newfound physical fitness and vigor			0
the experience gave the team members altered perspective , a sense of purpose , healthy eating habits , a wealth of new skills , mental fortitude and a string of wonderful memories			1
it gave them a new life as triathletes , filled with belief in themselves and lifelong friendships			0
of course , challenges are never easy			0
it takes a huge amount of courage to try a new sport and set a new goal			2
the @entity22 all had personal barriers			0
they were all nervous about testing themselves , taking risks and biting off more than they could chew			0
they all worried about the what ifs			0
what if i ca n't do the training ? what if i ca n't learn to swim ? what if i crash on the bike ? what if i ca n't finish ? what if i let myself down ? while watching them conquer their fears , i realized once again that the only limits are those that exist in the mind			1
the key is to overcome and move beyond them -- to a space where our real power dwells			0
@entity93 champ : train your brain , then your body four years ago i was asked whether i would ever do an @entity93			1
my response ? " no way , you must be completely mad to do something like that ! " but once i had done the shorter distance races , i realized that maybe the @entity93 mountain was n't so big after all			1
i gained confidence in myself , and with the support of my coach and training partners , i seized this new , exciting challenge with both hands			0
imagine if i had never gone back on my word , if i had n't changed " i ca n't " to " i can			0
" imagine if i had n't dared to push myself harder , and most importantly , if i had n't had people to support , encourage , mentor and make me believe in me ? i would never be sitting here as four - time @entity114 champion			0
getting to the starting line of your first triathlon the same goes for the 2012 @entity118			1
if the team members had n't had the courage to overcome their fears and doubts , they may never have been able to call themselves triathletes			1
and they , and their families and loved ones , may not be looking to the future filled with optimism , positivity and unbridled confidence			0
i await the news of the selection of the 2013 @entity8 team , knowing it marks the start of a journey that will change lives , empowering a new group to defy what they may have deemed impossible and inspire everyone else out there to do the same			1
this is the start of a new beginning , for them and for you			0
to apply to be a 2013 @entity8 team member , go to @entity147 and share your story			1
if you are selected , you 'll receive a bike , uniform , wet suit , personal training and nutrition coaching , two all - expenses - paid training trips and a chance to train and compete alongside @entity35 at the 2013 @entity10 .			2
