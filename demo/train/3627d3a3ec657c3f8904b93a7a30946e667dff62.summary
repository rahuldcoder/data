@entity0 , @entity1 -- the garbage crisis in @entity4 encompasses the worst @entity1 clichés , and in particular those of the southern part of this lovely peninsula : mismanagement , political interference , mafia profiteering and the ability of those responsible to deflect the attention and the blame elsewhere			1
@entity4 has had problems in finding sites for municipal dumps -- now workers have stopped collecting trash			1
there is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this : everybody is competent enough ( to find a solution ) but nobody is responsible ( for actually carrying it out )			0
in many parts of the world waste disposal is a business -- and usually it is a good business			2
garbage can be transformed into various sources of energy and then sold for a profit			0
in @entity4 , garbage is also good business , but in the sense that millions , if not billions , of euros have been wasted -- and nobody really knows how			1
the problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash			0
the region 's dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago , and since then a state of emergency has been declared every year			1
eight different commissioners have been appointed , but they have all failed to solve the problem			0
state of emergency means government money : € 1.8 billion ( more than $ 2.5 billion ) in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem			1
it is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent			0
incinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished , either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job , or else because magistrates stopped the work , pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement			0
one @entity1 newspaper suggested that a good 20 % of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution to the problem			0
more worrying perhaps , is another suggestion : that the local mafia , known as the @entity74 , is taking advantage of the situation			1
as the crisis has worsened over the years , so the @entity74 's profits , estimated now at around € 1 billion ( roughly $ 1.45 billion ) , are alleged to have increased			2
how does the local mafia make money ? the @entity4 prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation			1
once they receive the money , companies linked to the underworld dispose of the waste either in the open or , ironically , at regular city dumps , even if they are overflowing			0
the mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile			2
but why are citizens protesting now ? well , the government wants to re-open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of @entity4 and surrounding areas			1
the problem is that when the site was closed years ago , locals were promised that a golf course would be built there			2
as a result , many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity -- in some cases just a few yards away from the site			2
they are now waking up to a mountain of trash instead of 18 holes			0

rubbish is *piling* up on the streets of @entity4 , with municipal dumps full
many commentators *question* the role of the local mafia in the award of contracts
more than $ 2.5b in emergency funds has been spent on the problem over the years
one dump was going to be a golf course -- residents *furious* it is being re-opened
