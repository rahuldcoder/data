it 's hardly the catchiest of brand names and @entity5 knew it			2
six months into running his online grocery business , the @entity7 entrepreneur was desperate to find a shorter , more memorable name -- but he 'd run out of ideas			1
like so many others , his @entity12 moment came inside that steamy cocoon of inspiration where dirt is cleaned and geniuses are born : the shower			0
" while i was in the shower one day , " recalls @entity5 , " i just had an epiphany of sorts and then , ' yay , it will be glue ! ' " he adds			2
" for the six months that we were in operation , " explains @entity5 , " people were coming to site and then you see them coming back repeatedly -- so it looks like our service has a glue effect			0
" to make it more appealing , @entity5 changed the word 's two last letters and that 's how @entity36 was born , @entity7 's leading online grocery store			1
a former doctor helping trauma patients in a @entity41 hospital , @entity5 says he decided to go into business with his wife to try to cater to @entity7 's busy women with no time to shop at the supermarket			1
" i saw the stress ; i saw the love and passion of trying to keep up a very happy home , a very happy family ; traveling up and down and then ( being ) busy on a daily basis , " says @entity5			2
" and then you have a husband that is totally useless at cooking or taking care of the house , so all this pressure you see coming on , " he adds			0
" this for me was a way of trying to relieve her of that stress -- my own expression of love			0
" since then , the company has grown to employ nine staff , operating from inside a 20,000 square feet warehouse			0
and although it 's yet to make a profit , @entity5 hopes he can expand the brand as more and more @entity7 turn to online shopping			1
