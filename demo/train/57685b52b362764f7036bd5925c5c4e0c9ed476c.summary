-- @entity1 filed an appeal with @entity4 's @entity3 to review a ruling that it must pay billions of dollars in damages for oil pollution in the @entity9 rain forest			1
in addition to the $ 8.6 billion ruling , the court said that @entity1 must publicly apologize to @entity4 , and if it fails to do so , the fine will be doubled to nearly $ 18 billion			1
the ruling @entity1 is appealing was handed by an @entity4 appeals court on january 4 , nearly a year after the panel received the case , the state - run @entity15 news agency reported			1
the case stems from claims that the company had a detrimental impact on @entity9 communities where it operated			2
@entity1 says it has filed the appeal with @entity4 's @entity28			1
" throughout the course of this litigation , judges corruptly operating in concert with the plaintiffs ' lawyers have created , rather than corrected , injustice , " @entity29 , @entity1 vice president and general counsel , said friday			2
@entity1 's appeal is the latest in 19 years of litigation between @entity9 residents and @entity41 , which was later purchased by @entity1			1
at the time of the january ruling , @entity1 said the appeals court decision " is another glaring example of the politicization and corruption of @entity4 's judiciary that has plagued this fraudulent case from the start			1
" the company alleges that reports and evidence against it were fraudulent , and that bribes and corruption led to the original decision against it			0
" @entity1 does not believe that the @entity4 ruling is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of law			1
the company will continue to seek to hold accountable the perpetrators of this fraud , " the company said in a statement			0
when an @entity4 court handed down the original ruling last year , both @entity1 and the @entity9 residents appealed			1
@entity1 argued the verdict was the product of fraud and the plaintiffs said the size of the award was too small in comparison to what would be needed to do a real clean - up			0
the case , @entity80 v. @entity1 , was originally filed in @entity81 in 1993 on behalf of 30,000 inhabitants of @entity4 's @entity83			2
the suit was eventually transferred to the @entity4 court and @entity4 jurisdiction			0
the lawsuit alleges that @entity41 used a variety of substandard production practices in @entity4 that resulted in pollution that decimated several indigenous groups in the area , according to a fact sheet provided by the @entity94			0
according to the group , @entity41 dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into @entity9 waterways , abandoned more than 900 waste pits , burned millions of cubic meters of gases with no controls and spilled more than 17 million gallons of oil due to pipeline ruptures			0
cancer and other health problems were reported at higher rates in the area , the group says			0
@entity1 says @entity41 was partnered with an @entity4 oil company when it operated in @entity4 , and that it spent $ 40 million on remediation efforts to clean up roughly one - third of the sites in which it worked -- an amount reflective of its 37 % share of the oil - producing consortium with @entity116			2
it says its cleanup efforts were certified and approved by the @entity119 government and blames @entity116 for any ongoing pollution at sites where it was the sole operator , according to documents on the @entity1 website regarding the lawsuit and its history of operations in the @entity129 country .			0

@entity1 's appeal continues 19 years of litigation
the fine will double if @entity1 does not apologize , an appeals court has ruled
