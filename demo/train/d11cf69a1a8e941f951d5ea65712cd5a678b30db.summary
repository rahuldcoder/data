@entity0 , @entity1 -- the mantra in @entity4 during the current winter storm is " stay home , " but some doctors and nurses really do need to get to hospitals to take care of the sick			0
so , many of them rely on a group of hardy volunteer drivers for transport			1
@entity16 was running @entity18 's command center wednesday morning , coordinating the driver pickups and drop - offs			1
he described the volunteer drivers as " unbelievable saviors for us			1
" one of those volunteers is @entity23 , who left his home at 6 a.m. to pick up two nurses before heading to the hospital , where he picked up another nurse to take her home			1
@entity23 initially said he does it because he thinks it 's the right thing to do			1
but he later admitted he also does it because it he enjoys it			0
" my wife can stay with the kids			0
i get to play in the snow and nobody can yell at me for being out driving in the snow , " he told @entity2			1
" i had a police officer the first day pull up at a stoplight and yell at me for being on the road			2
i told him i was driving for the hospital and he laughed and said , ' well then , have fun			1
' " @entity23 drives a 1995 @entity45 for his pick - ups			1
he says he likes the jeep better than his four - wheel drive			2
" the reason is the short wheel base			0
i can actually turn around in a single lane in traffic , whereas if i had my bigger four - wheel drive , it does n't turn around and it 's not as nimble , " he said			0
as @entity23 was making that point , his jeep started sliding sideways along the road			2
but he did n't miss a beat as he regained control			0
" like where we just slid out there , the @entity56 can handle it better than the truck , " he said			0
the volunteer drivers are offered a gas voucher from the hospital , but @entity16 said most of them turn it down			1
@entity16 has an active list of about 30 people who drive for the hospital during inclement weather			1
wednesday morning he said the drivers had done somewhere near 50 pick - ups and drop - offs in the previous 24 hours			0
the hospital workers appreciate the volunteer drivers			1
" i did n't have any other options , " said @entity79			0
he heard about the rides from e-mails and texts that the hospital sent to its employees			0
one intensive - care nurse said she had driven herself to work the past few days			0
" i do n't know how i made it , " she said , adding , " @entity87 bless " the drivers			0
one night - shift supervisor named @entity91 said she received a ride from @entity23 on thursday morning			2
she lives only a few miles from the hospital , but did n't think she would be able to make it home in the snow			2
@entity91 said , " this is worse than ... " @entity23 finished her sentence : " ... anything so far			2

about 30 people drive for @entity18 during inclement weather
