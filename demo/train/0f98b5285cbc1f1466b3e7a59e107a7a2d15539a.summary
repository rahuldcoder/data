-- women in @entity3 may be forced to share certain private medical conditions with their employers if they want their contraception to be covered by health insurance , a bill proposes			1
the @entity8 is considering a bill that would give all businesses the option to exclude contraceptives from health insurance coverage			1
the only exception is if a woman can prove she is taking the contraceptives for other medical reasons			0
supporters say such a law would protect the religious beliefs of employers , while critics assert the tradeoff would be an affront to the liberties of employees			1
the @entity3 debate comes on the heels of a federal controversy over the same issue			1
an @entity32 administration policy originally required religiously affiliated institutions -- including hospitals and universities -- to offer contraception coverage			1
after heavy resistance from @entity40 lawmakers and religious institutions , the rule was amended to exempt employers from paying for contraceptives and will now instead require insurance companies to offer the coverage at no cost			2
the @entity3 legislation arises as a response to that			0
the legislation , @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , was passed by the state house this month and now sits before the @entity8			0
" i personally do n't have a moral objection to contraceptives , but i respect the people that do , " state rep. @entity54 , one of the @entity40 sponsors of the bill , told @entity0 affiliate @entity57 in @entity58			0
" @entity51 allows @entity3 employers to opt out of the contraceptive mandate if they have a religious or moral objection , " she told @entity57			2
denying women coverage for contraceptives would restrict women 's access to basic health care , said the @entity71 of @entity3			2
" as strongly as the @entity71 has protected people 's rights to their religious beliefs , express those beliefs and practice those beliefs , we feel the bill goes beyond guaranteeing protections for religious liberties and into allowing an employer to prioritize his religious beliefs over the beliefs , needs , interests of his employees , particularly his female employees , " @entity72 , public policy director for the @entity71 of @entity3 , told @entity57			1
@entity3 already has a law on the books that allows religious employers to deny such coverage , but the current bill would modify the law to allow any business to make the same exclusion			1
" we live in @entity98 and government should n't force mom - and - pop employers to do something against their moral beliefs , " @entity54 told the @entity0 affiliate			0
the bill has some exceptions that its supporters said should allay critics ' fears			0
for instance , coverage for contraception can not be denied if it is prescribed for medical reasons other than pregnancy prevention			0
but the @entity71 and others said that this exception amounts to an invasion of privacy that will force women to share sensitive medical information with their employers .			0
