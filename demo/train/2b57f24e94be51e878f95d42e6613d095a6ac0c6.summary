@entity10 never even saw @entity9 play , basing his assessment solely on stats			1
@entity30 's 2010 prediction he breaks out every possible statistic when analyzing a player			1
he keeps all the information in an elaborate spreadsheet on an old @entity36 laptop in his modest apartment			0
@entity10 said @entity9 caught his eye because of his high two - point field goal percentage and his ability to rebound , steal and block			1

" how often your team wins depends on putting it in [ the basket ] the most efficiently , and that 's what the two - point percentage is a measure of			1
" @entity10 found it intriguing that no one else seemed to be paying attention to @entity9			1
" i look for underdogs , but the player has to be good			0
i wo n't specifically say i 'm going to find myself an underdog , because @entity59 do n't happen every year , " @entity10 explained			1
" but when they do , you want to be ready to say , ' this is a guy we should look at			0
' " outside of the online world of " stat heads , " as amateur analysts call themselves , no one paid much attention to @entity10 's 2010 assessment			1
@entity9 was n't even picked in the @entity71 draft			2
he played briefly for the @entity72 and @entity73 , but he was cut from both teams without making much of an impact before being picked up by the @entity76 in late 2011			0
