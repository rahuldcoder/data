@entity0 -- @entity2 makes no secret that it sees @entity4 is its biggest threat but the scale of the threat is less clear cut			1
@entity2 's recent military exercises are seen by some as a show of strength to @entity4			1
prime minister @entity13 has not missed an opportunity to name @entity4 as the number one threat , and like his predecessors he has said @entity2 will not tolerate a nuclear @entity4			1
tests are ongoing for @entity2 's arrow missile system , designed to intercept incoming rockets -- although @entity2 does not openly say which direction they 'd come from			2
last week , @entity1 filmed @entity13 aboard an @entity24 fighter - bomber jet while touring the @entity26 air force base near @entity27			0
he said : " my biggest impression today is the obligation to carry out the mission of defending @entity2			0
" last month , two @entity2 warships and a submarine made a rare journey through @entity35 's @entity34			2
last year , the @entity2 air force tested its fighter jets and helicopters on a 870 - mile sortie -- roughly the distance between @entity2 and @entity4 's main uranium enrichment plant at @entity42			1
the official line ... @entity2 's security is a continuing concern			0
the common perception is that some , if not all of these exercises were a show of strength for @entity4			0
estimates of when @entity4 could have a nuclear bomb differ widely			1
in february , the @entity53 released a report that concluded @entity4 does not have a nuclear weapon but does have enough low - enriched uranium for a single nuclear weapon			0
but an official at the @entity59 cautioned about drawing such conclusions			0
the @entity62 nuclear watchdog agency said @entity4 's stock of low - enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons - grade material			2
the official said in february that @entity4 has not done so , and the agency 's monitors and surveillance equipment at the @entity42 facility would be able to detect any such activity			0
@entity72 , former @entity2 ambassador to the @entity62 said , " the @entity59 has inspected the known nuclear sites of @entity4			1
but it 's believed they still have other clandestine nuclear sites where they may be enriching uranium or they may be pursuing a plutonium route like the @entity80			2
so there 's a certain amount of uncertainty in any assessment in the timeline of an @entity4 bomb			2
@entity4 says its nuclear ambitions are for peaceful means , and @entity2 is widely believed to have nuclear weapons itself			1
but @entity2 's defense secretary @entity93 , at a meeting with @entity92 defense secretary @entity91 recently , made it clear he believes @entity92 attempts at negotiations with @entity4 have a shelf - life			1
" we clearly believe that no option should be removed from the table and this is our policy			0
we recommend to others to take the same position , but we can not dictate it to anyone			0
" @entity104 , an @entity2 analyst on @entity106 affairs and author of " from terror to @entity109 : the significance of the @entity4 threat , " estimates that " theoretically " @entity4 could develop a nuclear bomb within the next year			1
but even if @entity2 's conviction is correct that @entity4 wants a nuclear weapon and it is close to achieving that desire , does that mean it would use it against @entity2 ? @entity104 said : " my personal view is that @entity4 would not do it because they understand that @entity2 does have a nuclear arsenal			1
it has to take that into account and because the @entity92 will deter @entity4 as well			2
" if you ask me , can you guarantee they will not use it , then no i ca n't			0
" but that question is a step too far for @entity2			0
it is far more concerned with what a nuclear @entity4 could do to the balance of the @entity106 and the likely nuclear race that would follow with many of @entity2 's neighbors			1
as @entity134 says : " what is a prime minister of israel supposed to do when he sees that threat growing to his east ? "			0

senior @entity2 *lawmakers* have @entity4 top of the country 's threat list
they believe @entity92 attempts at negotiation could fall short
former *diplomat* says it is believed @entity4 still has secret sites for nuclear program
one analyst says if @entity4 develops nuclear bomb it does not mean they would use it
