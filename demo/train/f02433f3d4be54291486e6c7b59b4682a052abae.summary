-- in 2009 , a freshly elected @entity2 president who campaigned on the themes of hope and change appointed a veteran negotiator to take a crack at the @entity10 - @entity9 conflict			1
now , 32 months after president @entity12 named former sen. @entity13 as his chief @entity15 envoy , the peace process is stalled and the @entity2 faces the diplomatically dangerous possibility of having to veto a @entity19 resolution on @entity9 statehood			1
how did it get to this point ? the answers are in the intractable nature of the conflict , political pressures faced by the @entity10 and @entity9 leaderships , and a steady waning of @entity2 influence in the region , exacerbated by the @entity32 protests that erupted last december			1
@entity9 president @entity33 said monday he intends to submit an application for statehood to the @entity19 , according to @entity37 spokesman @entity36 , setting up a possible vote as soon as friday			1
@entity2 officials have made clear they will veto it , affirming the longstanding backing for @entity10 , the nation 's strongest @entity15 ally			1
meanwhile , behind - the - scenes negotiations are seeking to avoid a move certain to evoke @entity47 protests of @entity2 bias and even hypocrisy			1
a @entity2 veto would amount to @entity51 blocking an outcome it has publicly supported -- the creation of a @entity9 state next to @entity10			1
however , the @entity12 administration insists that result must occur through a negotiated deal with @entity10			0
" we continue to believe and are pressing the point that the only way to a two - state solution , which is what we support and want to see happen , is through negotiations , " secretary of state @entity59 said late monday			1
addressing the possible @entity9 statehood bid , she added that " no matter what does or does n't happen , this will not produce the kind of outcome that everyone is hoping for , so we are going to stay very much engaged and focused			1
" also monday , @entity10 prime minister @entity72 said he was willing to meet with @entity33 in @entity73 to launch direct talks that would continue back in the @entity15 after the @entity75			0
@entity72 's offer was an obvious attempt to give @entity33 a plausible reason to put off the statehood bid , an outcome desired by the @entity2			1
" for president @entity12 , who came into office speaking about self - determination and promised the @entity9 that it 's a new day and a new dawn for them , to go to the @entity19 and cast a veto against the @entity9 state is politically problematic , " @entity81 , a senior fellow at the @entity82 think tank , said monday on @entity0			1
" it 's really a catastrophe for him in the @entity47 world , but he has no choice but to pass the veto if it came to that , " @entity81 continued			1
" the hope is ( that ) between now and friday , some exit , some other formula will be found to spare one and all in this confrontation at the @entity19			0
" @entity102 , a @entity0 contributor on national security issues , said the potential @entity37 vote " puts the @entity2 in a very awkward position			1
" " it is a veto that will most certainly undermine @entity2 credibility as an honest broker in the peace process , " at least in the eyes of the @entity47 world , @entity102 said			1
the latest developments come five months after @entity13 's resignation			0
he said he only signed up to tackle the world 's toughest diplomatic job for two years , but he was clearly frustrated by the inability to restart direct negotiations between @entity10 and the @entity9			2
@entity13 , who was 77 when he stepped down , traveled back and forth in the region trying to overcome the decades of hostility and mistrust that bedeviled the peace process			0
face - to - face negotiations sought by the @entity2 and its mediating partners from the @entity19 , @entity124 and @entity125 never materialized			1
the @entity12 administration came into office hoping to seduce the @entity15 with a more sensitive and compassionate posture after eight years of the @entity130 administration that brought war in @entity132 and tough posturing against @entity134 and other enemies of @entity10			0
in june 2009 , @entity12 used a high - profile speech in @entity137 , @entity138 , on relations between the @entity2 and the @entity141 world to address the @entity10 - @entity9 conflict			1
he reaffirmed the @entity2 endorsement of a two - state solution and urged compromise and understanding between " two peoples with legitimate aspirations			1
" addressing two main issues in the dispute , @entity12 said the @entity2 government " does not accept the legitimacy of continued @entity10 settlements " in the @entity155 , and declared that " it is time for ( settlement construction ) to stop			2
" he also called @entity2 's bond with @entity10 " unbreakable " and said @entity9 violence such as rocket and mortar attacks on @entity10 must cease			1
in particular , @entity12 said the @entity162 movement -- which controls @entity163 -- must end violence and recognize past agreements			0
less than a year later , any perception of progress began to shatter			0
not only did @entity12 fail to make good on his @entity137 pledges , but his inability to rein in @entity10 on settlement - building was evidence of how hard jump - starting negotiations would be			2
in march 2010 , @entity10 announced a new settlement project in @entity172 , maintaining its insistence that the entire city would always be part of its territory			0
after years of lukewarm reactions to such statements about new settlements by @entity10 , the @entity2 chose to push the envelope , turning the incident into a crisis that further hindered the peace process when @entity72 would not give in			2
then came the @entity163 flotilla raid on may 31 , 2010 , when @entity10 commandos stormed a @entity187 ship leading an effort to break @entity10 's blockade of the @entity9 territory			2
the incident , in which nine @entity187 were killed , cast a harsh spotlight on the grave humanitarian situation in @entity163 and led to a breakdown in relations between @entity10 and @entity187 , one of its few allies in the region			0
against that backdrop , the @entity32 of pro-democracy uprisings that started in @entity200 and spread to @entity138 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and other states became an uncontrolled factor in the @entity15 equation			0
hesitant @entity2 support for protesters , first in @entity138 , then in @entity201 and now in @entity202 , raised questions in the region about the clarity and commitment of the @entity12 administration 's policy			2
in a speech in may , @entity12 expressed support for pro-democracy aspirations in the @entity15			0
he also offered specifics on a possible @entity10 - @entity9 agreement based on pre- 1967 borders and including land swaps to reflect current realities on the ground			2
the pre- 1967 borders refer to @entity10 's territory before the six - day war that year in which it took control of the @entity163 , @entity155 , @entity172 and other territory from neighboring countries			0
both sides found reason to reject @entity12 's proposal as a basis for resuming peace talks , and now the successful @entity32 protests have given @entity33 new impetus to challenge @entity10 and the @entity2 by seeking statehood through the @entity19			1
former @entity2 president @entity240 said sunday that the @entity9 were making the @entity37 bid out of frustration			1
" they have reinforced cooperation with the @entity10 , " @entity240 told the @entity245 's " @entity244			0
" " they have produced a growing economy on the @entity155			0
and all the @entity47 countries except @entity202 have offered @entity10 a political , military and security partnership for the future , including opposition to @entity134 's nuclear design , if they create a @entity9 state			1
" and yet , @entity240 noted , " there 's been no progress			0
" one reason for a lack of progress has been uncertainty over the status of a @entity9 unity effort involving the @entity33 - led authority in the @entity155 and @entity162 , which rules @entity163			2
@entity10 and the @entity2 consider @entity162 a terrorist group and refuse to negotiate with it			2
the @entity2 also has called on @entity162 to renounce violence and recognize @entity10 's right to exist in order to take part in the peace process			2
@entity162 does not support president @entity33 ' bid for statehood			0
@entity162 leader @entity275 has said @entity276 does not have the right to sacrifice @entity9 rights , including making concessions on @entity9 land or the right of return for @entity9 refugees			2
he said @entity162 will not recognize @entity10 's right to a jewish state			0
@entity102 said the changing face of the @entity15 is worrying to @entity10 , noting the @entity287 strengthening in @entity138 , the possibility of anti-israel factions gaining a role in @entity201 and the constant threat from @entity134			0
" so you can understand @entity10 's concern about their current security , " @entity102 said			0
" i think @entity10 is rightly concerned			0
this is a very dangerous time			0

@entity2 backs an independent @entity9 state through negotiations
@entity9 will submit an application for statehood to @entity37
@entity2 officials have made it clear they will veto such a move
behind - the - scenes negotiations are trying to avoid a move certain to evoke @entity47 protests
