@entity0 -- after yet more financial turmoil and political wrangling , citizens in @entity3 readied to hit the polls sunday to decide an election that may determine the debt - stricken country 's future in the eurozone and significantly impact the global economy			1
two parties , @entity13 and @entity14 , are considered to be front - runners going into the vote			2
@entity17 has now ended but in the last official polls they were running neck - and - neck			0
no new polls are allowed in the 14 days before voting takes place			0
what will @entity3 elections mean for the country 's future ? should a working majority emerge under the leadership of the moderate @entity29 , @entity3 may follow through with the next installment of public spending cuts demanded by its " troika " of creditors : the @entity35 , the @entity36 and the @entity37			1
but if the left - wing @entity14 party emerges as the largest , with its commitment to tear up the current bailout agreement , markets will begin to anticipate a " disorderly exit " from the eurozone			1
sunday 's election was called after an initial ballot on may 6 , the first since @entity3 's financial crisis exploded , failed to deliver a majority for any one party and talks to create a government failed			1
since then , @entity3 -- whose people have been suffering under a heavy burden of painful austerity measures , high unemployment and a long - running recession -- has been roiled by uncertainty and division			2
global markets have also been volatile amid fears that @entity3 could exit the euro currency union , a step that could drag down other ailing euro nations and send shock waves through the world 's financial markets			1
many voters were focused on @entity3 's @entity70 soccer match against @entity71 on saturday night in @entity72 -- a welcome distraction from the political drama playing out at home , especially after @entity77 's goal helped propel the @entity3 side into the high - profile tournament 's quarterfinal round			1
a wild election weekend for @entity3 , @entity82 and @entity83 some analysts fear sunday 's election could again result in no clear winner , leaving @entity3 with a weak caretaker government at a time when the nation needs clear leadership			1
@entity14 leader @entity90 has threatened to renege on the terms of @entity3 's bailout , but he has also expressed a desire to remain in the euro currency union			1
@entity95 , leader of @entity13 , has said his party wants to remain in the eurozone and alter existing policies , including stringent austerity measures , to " achieve development and offer people relief			0
" @entity13 and the @entity102 were punished by voters in the last election for supporting the bailout program , as well as for agreeing to the austerity measures that came with it			2
@entity3 must identify additional budget cuts by the end of june to be considered " compliant " with the terms of its bailout program			2
the future of @entity114 : 3 scenarios speaking to his cabinet for the last time friday , interim prime minister @entity116 praised the spirit of teamwork the caretaker government had shown in office			0
in these difficult hours , he said , " @entity3 will have a much better outcome if we all put aside our differences and work towards the common good of this nation			0
" his government had dealt with very difficult issues in the past 30 days , he said , and its work would continue until a new elected government was in place			0
the situation in @entity3 is likely to be on the minds of world leaders as they meet in @entity136 on monday for the @entity137			0
some experts argue that a potential @entity3 exit would be manageable , assuming the @entity37 and @entity141 policymakers respond aggressively			0
as economic crisis bites , @entity3 's children pay the price but others worry that such an unprecedented event would cause chaos in financial markets and shock the global economy			1
what does it mean to be @entity3 right now ? tell us on @entity153			0
