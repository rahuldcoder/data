-- the @entity1 wo n't be headed north to @entity2 after all -- despite its owners reaching a deal to sell the team to a @entity7 state group -- after @entity9 executives voted wednesday to reject such a move			1
twenty - two members of the league 's @entity12 rejected the @entity1 ' relocation bid , while eight voted in favor			1
commissioner @entity16 cited the existence of a " strong ownership group , " a construction team and plan to build a new arena , plus strong support from @entity1 's mayor and others in the region , as reasons why the @entity1 will remain in northern @entity27			1
" i would say it 's a victory for @entity1 , not the @entity9 , " @entity16 told reporters , applauding the " excellent " if ultimately unsuccessful @entity2 bid			1
wednesday 's vote follows months of talks between members of the @entity34 , the majority owners of the @entity1 , and a @entity2 - based group that includes investor @entity37 and @entity40 ceo @entity39			1
in january , these two parties reached a deal for that group to buy the @entity45 ' 53 % share of the team as well as minority owner @entity48 's 12 % stake			0
but that agreement needed the ok of the @entity9 's board of governors to go through			2
the @entity34 family and @entity37 's group , though , kept on talking , leading to another deal ( for a higher price ) and this week 's scheduled vote by the @entity9 board			2
meanwhile , @entity1 mayor @entity59 -- himself a former all - star @entity9 guard -- kept pushing to keep the @entity1 in his city			1
that involved crafting a stadium plan and working with a group of individuals committed to keeping the team in @entity1			0
@entity16 said that over the " next 24 to 48 hours , " @entity9 officials will talk to the @entity45 to try to " facilitate an agreement " for them to sell the @entity1 to the so - called @entity72 group , thus assuring the team remains in @entity27			2
and he vowed " fair dealing and ultimate consideration down to the road " for any future efforts to land an @entity9 team in @entity2 , which saw its last franchise -- the @entity78 -- leave for @entity79 in 2008			0
after wednesday 's vote , @entity59 said he was excited the @entity1 are staying put , saying it will be a boon for his city			2
and he promised that he and others in @entity1 will continue working to execute their plan			0
" we 're going to deliver			0
why ? because it 's bigger than basketball , " @entity59 said			0
" we 're talking economic development and job creation			0

the @entity9 @entity12 votes *22* - 8 to reject the @entity1 move to @entity2
@entity9 's commissioner calls it " a victory for @entity1 " more than a *defeat* for @entity2
@entity1 's mayor calls the vote " bigger than basketball " for his city and region
