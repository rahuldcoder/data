-- the disputed head of the @entity5 will not step down , one of his key ministers said saturday , despite the threat by @entity8 leaders to use military force to force him out			1
a day earlier , a statement from the 15 - member @entity12 said its 15 members would not hesitate to use " legitimate force " if necessary to defuse an escalating crisis in the @entity5			1
but @entity16 , the foreign affairs minister for incumbent president @entity17 , on saturday dismissed the threat as part of a @entity22 plot spearheaded by @entity23			1
he said that his regime views the prospect of outside military action unlikely , claiming that the @entity8 group 's members would be reluctant to send soldiers into the @entity5			1
the organization 's move was the latest to isolate @entity17 , amid sweeping international sentiment that he is not the @entity5 's rightfully elected leader and that his forces have perpetrated human rights abuses against his opponents			1
the @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and numerous individual nations have called for @entity17 to step down , with many also calling out his regime for its actions against political foes in the past week that have reportedly killed scores of people			1
still , the call from the @entity12 was especially significant , given that the @entity5 is a member and its mention of possible military action			2
" in the event that mr. @entity17 fails to heed this immutable demand of @entity12 , the @entity12 would be left with no alternative but to take other measures , including the use of legitimate force , to achieve the goals of the @entity5 people , " the group said in a statement following an emergency meeting friday in @entity55 , @entity56			1
under the leadership of @entity56 president @entity68 , the regional bloc will coordinate , " without delay , " a meeting of defense ministers from member countries " to plan future actions , including the provision of security along the @entity5 - @entity77 border , " the statement said			2
this back - and - forth comes as the security situation in the @entity5 continues to deteriorate			2
the @entity37 refugee agency said saturday that about 14,000 @entity5 residents escaping that country have fled to eastern @entity77 , some walking hours if not days before boarding barges on rivers bordering the @entity8 nation			1
a few deaths have been reported among the refugees , including a child who drowned while crossing the @entity88 into @entity89			0
in some locales without ambulances , @entity37 high commissioner for refugees vehicles are being used to take people out to get medical care			0
" some are arriving with severely swollen feet , ... some families said they had walked three to four days through the bush with little food , " the @entity37 agency said in a statement			0
a spokesman for @entity103 , widely recognized as the @entity5 's legitimate leader following a november 28 run - off election , accused @entity17 of defying democratic ideals and instead embarking on new era of violence			1
spokesman @entity109 said friday that @entity103 hopes the @entity8 leaders will be able to help end the turmoil			1
meanwhile , the @entity112 said on friday that at the request of @entity23 , it had dispatched one of its ships to the @entity5 to help evacuate @entity117 citizens in case the situation worsens			2
and @entity121 spokesman @entity120 said earlier this week that the @entity122 and other countries were discussing with @entity8 nations the possibility of augmenting the existing @entity37 force in the @entity5			1
however , he said it was unclear what a @entity122 contribution could look like -- forces of logistical support or something more indirect were among the options			0
the @entity38 has suspended the @entity5 from the organization " until such a time the democratically elected president effectively assumes state power			2
" the @entity137 has halted lending and disbursing funds to @entity5 and has closed its office in the country			0
on friday , @entity37 @entity142 ban ki - moon welcomed the decision of the @entity144 to recognize @entity103 as the winner of the disputed @entity5 election			2
" this important decision reflects the united position of the international community with respect to the legitimacy of the new government led by president @entity103 , " a spokesman for the secretary - general said in a written statement			1
@entity156 , the @entity37 deputy high commissioner for human rights , has said that between december 16 and tuesday , human rights officers had " substantiated allegations of 173 killings , 90 instances of torture and ill treatment , 471 arrests and detentions and 24 cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances			0
" she added that the actual numbers may be much higher because " it has been impossible to investigate all the allegations of serious human rights violations , including reports of mass graves , due to restrictions on movement by @entity37 personnel			0
" while acknowledging " the situation is very , very difficult to live " in , @entity176 -- the nation 's youth minister under @entity17 -- said thursday the government is " dealing with that			1
" he said " the @entity37 report is not correct , " especially in its fingering fellow @entity17 backers as being to blame for the recent violence			0
instead , he accused @entity103 's supporters of using weapons at what had been billed as peaceful rallies to attack soldiers			0
after last month 's election , the country 's @entity190 named @entity103 the winner			0
but its @entity194 invalidated those results and declared that @entity17 won			0
@entity176 said that he and others in @entity17 's circle could n't accept the electoral commission picking @entity103 , noting that it announced its decision in a hotel that was also being used as @entity103 's headquarters			2
while stressing a desire for talks on the issue , he said there is no intention for @entity17 to forfeit a seat that he believes is rightfully his			0
" why do you want someone who won an election to step down ? " @entity176 asked			0
" the president has been elected			0

the @entity5 's @entity17 will not step down , his foreign minister says
the official dismisses as unlikely a threat by @entity8 leaders to use force against @entity17
on friday , that group said it may have " no alternative " but to use " legitimate force "
the international community has called @entity17 *illegitimate* and accused his forces of abuses
