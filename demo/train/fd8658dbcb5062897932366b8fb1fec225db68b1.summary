@entity0 , @entity1 -- nearly two dozen @entity5 -- most thought to work for the @entity6 -- were sentenced to five years in prison wednesday by an @entity1 court for their role in the seizing of a suspected terrorist in @entity1 in 2003 , the prosecutor in the case told @entity2			1
the @entity5 did not appear for trial and are not in custody , but the ruling could effectively make them international fugitives			1
the trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call " extraordinary rendition			1
" they say the @entity5 has often sent suspects to countries that practice torture			1
@entity23 acknowledges making secret " rendition " transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do			2
the case centered on the extraordinary rendition of a @entity34 cleric , @entity33 , or @entity35			1
he was seized on the streets of @entity38 , @entity1 , in 2003 , transferred to @entity39 and tortured , he said			1
he was suspected of recruiting men to fight in @entity41 and @entity42 and was under heavy surveillance by @entity1 's intelligence agency			2
prosecutors said he was nabbed by a @entity6 team working with @entity1 intelligence officials			1
the verdict " shows governments and institutions that the fight against terrorism has to be carried out in accordance with the law			0
there are no shortcuts , " @entity55 told @entity2			0
those who were found guilty were ordered to pay @entity35 1 million euros ( $ 1.48 million ) and his wife 500,000 euros			0
a total of 22 @entity5 were each sentenced to five years in prison for their role in his abduction			1
another -- @entity65 , whom prosecutors said was the @entity6 station chief in @entity38 -- was sentenced to eight years in jail , prosecutor @entity55 told @entity2			1
cases were dismissed against three other @entity5 , including @entity70 , the man assumed to be the @entity6 station chief in @entity0 at the time , because they had diplomatic immunity from prosecution			1
@entity55 said he may appeal that ruling			0
cases were also dismissed against the former head of @entity1 's intelligence service and his deputy because of state secrecy provisions			0
two other @entity1 were sentenced to three years in jail for aiding the plot			0
@entity86 , one of the @entity5 defendants , was " saddened , angered and dismayed " by the ruling , her lawyer told @entity2			1
she felt the @entity5 government had " stabbed her in the back , " @entity89 said			1
" we understand why the @entity1 did what they did			0
they were following their laws			0
but at the end of the day , representatives of our @entity5 government abroad were let down and left alone by their own government			1
" @entity101 , a career diplomat , is suing the @entity102 over the case , @entity89 confirmed			0
she has never said she worked for the @entity6			2
@entity6 spokesman @entity105 said wednesday : " the @entity6 has not commented on any of the allegations surrounding @entity35			2
" but @entity5 officials confirmed to @entity2 when the case first broke that the @entity6 was involved in the rendition of @entity35 from @entity1 to @entity39			1
the officials never disclosed the number of @entity5 involved or their names			2
@entity114 spokesman @entity113 responded to the verdict as it applied to an @entity118 officer , lt. col. @entity117 , who was among the @entity5 sentenced			2
the @entity114 had asserted jurisdiction over the incident under the @entity121 , a position that the @entity1 minister of justice supported , @entity113 said			0
" we are clearly disappointed by the court 's ruling , " @entity113 said			0
" our view is that the @entity1 court has no jurisdiction over lt. col. @entity117 and should have immediately dismissed the charges			0
" the @entity132 , a persistent critic of @entity23 's extraordinary rendition program , demanded the @entity5 match @entity1 's actions			1
" the decision in @entity1 underscores the need for the @entity5 to hold its own officials accountable for crimes committed under the ' extraordinary rendition ' program			1
it is shameful that the first convictions of this kind came from a foreign justice system , where those convicted are not likely to serve their time , " said @entity142 , staff attorney for the @entity143			0
@entity1 authorities originally indicted 26 @entity5 and five @entity1 in 2007 for kidnapping in the matter			2
the @entity1 included the former head of @entity1 intelligence , @entity155 , and one of his deputies			0
they testified in preliminary hearings that @entity1 intelligence played no role in the alleged abduction			0
none of the @entity5 is in custody in @entity1 and the @entity1 government did not ask for their extradition ; they were tried in absentia			1
former @entity6 analyst @entity166 told @entity2 in the past that the @entity1 military secret service had approved the operation involving @entity170 , and @entity6 sources who refused to be named told @entity2 in 2005 that the agency had briefed and sought approval from its @entity1 counterpart for such an abduction			2
the @entity1 government of the day -- which was led by @entity177 -- vigorously denied having authorized @entity170 's kidnapping , which it called illegal			0
@entity177 has since returned to power			0
@entity2 's @entity180 in @entity0 ; @entity181 in @entity182 , @entity183 ; and @entity184 and @entity185 in @entity23 contributed to this report .			0
