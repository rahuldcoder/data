-- is college worth the cost ? the question has echoed in the halls of government , over the family dinner table and throughout the media for decades			1
but the alarm bell has rung even louder in recent years , when student loan debt in the @entity10 grew to over $ 1.2 trillion and tuition increases continued at nearly triple the rate of inflation			1
just this summer the debate about the cost of college seemed to reach a fever pitch , as dueling perspectives seized national headlines			2
on the one hand , senator @entity20 bemoaned the fact that " millions of young people ... ca n't buy homes , they ca n't buy cars ... all because they are struggling under the weight of student loan debt			1
" in the same vein , president @entity27 declared that " we 're still seeing too big a debt load on too many young people " as he signed an executive action that would extend income - based repayment programs for graduates who ca n't earn enough to handle loan payments			1
but on the other hand , a @entity38 study released just days later offered a starkly different message			0
prominently covered by the @entity42 at the @entity43 called " the @entity44 , " the study said that " the impact of student loans may not be as dire as many commentators fear			1
" @entity48 of the @entity43 crystallized the argument with a headline reading , " the reality of @entity52 is different from the @entity53			0
" he pointed out that students with six figure debt loads represent a fraction of the overall picture and cited data that the ratio of borrowers ' monthly loan payments to monthly income has remained consistent when measured since the early 1990s			1
the authors of the study further questioned whether student debt was creating any kind of drag on the economy at all			1
so the question arose , was all this effort for student loan reform at the highest level of government an overreaction ? perhaps just a symptom of simplistic media coverage ? was the @entity43 ' own magazine cover about " boomerang kids " ( featuring a recent graduate with $ 80,000 in debt living at home ) or its front - page series on " @entity83 " ( featuring " a generation hobbled by the soaring cost of college " ) just another media @entity84 © ? certainly a media organization can accommodate competing perspectives , but was the take away that we should finally stop worrying and sign every student up for more loans already ? it became quickly apparent , however , that the @entity38 study had its flaws			1
one notable omission was the fact that 70 % of the class of 2014 would graduate with an average debt of $ 33,000 per borrower , as reported by @entity102			0
analysts also criticized various aspects of the study 's method			0
for example , using data from 2010 , the @entity38 authors define " young households " as homes headed by people ages 20 - 40			0
this dataset includes people who graduated college in the early - 1990s , when average debt per borrower was less than half what it is today			0
perhaps even more importantly , this dataset excludes young people still living at home with their parents and therefore not the heads of their households			0
such an exclusion is significant , since one in five college graduates under age 35 still live at home , and they are most likely the graduates with the highest debt levels ( hence the phenomenon of " boomerang kids " )			0
another important caveat is the fact that the average repayment period on student loans has increased from 7.4 years in 1992 to 13.4 years today			1
so while monthly payments may be similar to what they were twenty years ago , they now last for almost double the time			0
this is where the meme of " student debt slavery " enters the conversation			1
it used to be the case that student loan debt could be paid off by the time one might decide to start a family and buy a home			1
but now , there is a sense that student loan debt will haunt borrowers deep into adulthood , negatively affecting their ability to make life choices that are part of a healthy future and a key to the health of our economy			1
perhaps the biggest oversight in the @entity38 study , though , is that the data includes only borrowers actually making monthly repayments on their debt			0
thus the study does n't include all those who are in default , deferment or forbearance			0
and as data released in august revealed , less than half of student borrowers are actually paying their federal loans back on time , with defaults on the rise			2
so the @entity38 argument reads a bit like a tautology : those who are not having trouble paying back their loans are not having trouble paying back their loans			0
but lets take a step back from all of this data - crunching about student debt , and consider an even more fundamental question : is higher education a public good that benefits the whole country , or is it simply a private good that adds to an individual 's net worth ? this is the culturo - historical perspective that @entity204 seeks to explore in order to come to a more nuanced understanding of whether college is worth the cost			1
from the arrival of the first colonists in @entity212 , college in @entity10 has been a place for the moral development and intellectual uplift of young people			0
by the time of our nation 's founding , college had expanded from an institution simply meant to train the clergy to a critical component of a nascent democracy			2
an educated citizenry , according to @entity226 , was the best defense against tyranny			0
with the emergence of a new industrial economy in the 19th century , college education became both a source of individual edification and national prosperity , and with the @entity236 and 1890 , the federal government created free ( or nearly free ) institutions accessible to people who never would have dreamed of going to college before			2
private institutions also embraced this notion of education as a public good , with the wealthiest philanthropists of the era , such as @entity245 , @entity246 , and @entity247 endowing institutions for the benefit of both individual students and the broader society			1
in the @entity253 , the @entity252 of 1944 continued this tradition , offering free college education to millions of returning veterans , and laying the groundwork for an economic boom and vast expansion of the middle class			2
the federal student loan program itself began as a small part of @entity264 's vision for a @entity265 , as he aimed to increase access to college through the @entity268			1
but by the 1970s , this tradition was derailed , and the emphasis shifted to the private good of education			2
state legislatures , inspired by the example of @entity275 , made the argument that if students were receiving a wage premium from college , they should pay for it themselves			2
this attitude resulted in shifting the cost of college increasingly onto the shoulders of individual students through more and more student loans			1
at the same time , colleges and universities have found themselves in an ever more perverse arms race to compete with each other			2
as students have become more like customers , colleges have become more like businesses trying to attract those customers with fancier dormitories , recreation centers , and other amenities not essential to their core academic mission			1
and while the soaring " sticker price " of college has been at least somewhat offset at many institutions by increased financial aid , many of those discount packages actually include loans			0
indeed , only 1.25 % of the over four thousand institutions of higher education in the country offer financial aid that meets a student 's full need			1
returning to data and statistics , perhaps the most significant number one can cite in terms of the value of college is the $ 1 million lifetime earnings premium a bachelor 's degree confers			0
for some , this statistic puts the debate about whether college is worth it to rest			0
but while we can say that statistically a bachelor 's degree is worth it , that does not mean " college " as a whole is worth the cost			0
indeed , 68 % of students at public institutions do not graduate in 4 years , and 44 % fail to graduate in 6 years			2
that means that nearly half of the students who are signing up for a public university education will not enjoy the wage premium promised to them , yet they may still be saddled with debt			1
for students like these , the question of whether college is worth it is far more complicated			2
and in an economy where the disparity between the wealth of high school graduates and college graduates is increasingly stark , the choice to not go to college seems like financial suicide , even if the choice to take on debt may seem very risky as well			0
as @entity348 from the @entity349 puts it , " the only thing worse than going to college is not going to college			0
" ultimately , our society should not put so many young people , especially those from less advantaged backgrounds , in such a precarious position , particularly when the potential value of a college education for both students and society is so high			1

" @entity204 " *documentary* maker @entity364 examines the higher education crisis
is proposed student loan reform an overreaction ?
is higher education more beneficial to individuals -- or the nation as a whole ?
colleges have become more like businesses , with students as their customers
