-- most of the shock that resounds after hearing that @entity3 died monday comes from its utter implausibility			1
how could @entity3 , of all people , just stop breathing , moving and , most of all , talking ? it 's as though we 've been told the moon spun out of orbit or that water no longer boiled , or froze , at the proper temperature			1
if @entity3 is dead , then light no longer refracts , atoms no longer bond and gravity has gone out of business			2
for many of us over the last 40 years or so , @entity3 was an irresistible force of nature that nothing , not even the demons in his head or the sometimes regrettable consequences of their actions , could stop			1
if his motor ever ceased running , even for a second , his audiences rarely noticed it			0
they just stayed on the edge of their seats awaiting the next eruption , and were never disappointed by whatever inspired lunacy burst forth			0
practically from the beginning , when we first saw him turn scripts from the 1978 - 82 @entity39 sitcom " @entity40 " into staging areas for unalloyed free - form verbal jazz , @entity3 seemed in supernaturally perfect command of all the voices in his head			1
whether delivering stand - up comedy or an introduction at a testimonial dinner , @entity3 could make a casual digression into a stream - of - consciousness lick worthy of @entity51 , @entity52 or any surrealist you can name			1
where did he ever come up with @entity56 , we always wondered , whether it was a reference to an old movie we 'd thought we 'd forgotten or a side - swiping barb at a politician , or even something embarrassing about himself			0
patients remember @entity3 as ' comedic @entity63 ' his own rueful experience with addiction drew from him one of the greatest quotes ever about drugs : " cocaine is @entity70 's way of saying you make too much money			1
" or the one about how alcohol abuse can get so out - of - control , " you 'll do things that 'd make the @entity77 say , ' dude ... ' " someday soon , if it has n't already happened , there will be a collection of such aphorisms , which at times approached the trenchant pithiness of @entity84 or @entity85			0
the problem with remembering all of them now is that they were all but lost in the ack - ack fire of @entity3 ' spontaneous inventions			2
even when he stood still , you could almost feel the waves of energy struggling to break free			0
the way he contained those waves reminded us that his was a mind , paraphrasing @entity99 , that always kept itself in check			0
and besides , good actors can always make silence and space work to their advantage			0
imagine our surprise when it turned out that this most formidably intellectual of his generation 's comedians was also a very good -- and , at times , great actor			1
he channeled his high - octane inventiveness into creating indelible and endearing movie portrayals as the hip gi disc jockey in 1987 's " @entity118 , " for which he received the first of his three @entity122 nominations for best actor			2
i thought he should have won for playing a grief - mad widower in 1992 's " the @entity126 , " but @entity127 showed how much they loved him by giving him the best supporting actor @entity122 in 1998 for playing an emotionally wounded psychiatrist in " @entity131			0
" for whatever it 's worth , the @entity3 movies i most enjoyed were the ones where he took chances and / or let fly			2
this would , for me , exclude his title role as " @entity140 " ( though i understand why so many cherish its memory ) , but would include such wildly varied work as his supersonically spritzing genie in 1992 's " @entity146 " ; his underrated star turn in the underrated 1980 musical " @entity148 " ; and , among his riskiest performances , the portrayal of the clammy , anxiety - ridden hustler @entity151 in the 1986 tv movie version of @entity153 's " @entity137			0
" in all his roles , playing crazy or cute , good or evil , sagacious or sanctimonious , @entity3 always showed you his considerable empathy , not just for the people he rendered , but for the audience ; the same audience he sought to conquer , if not overpower , with his free - range comedy routines where , as with his friend and mentor @entity161 , he was most vividly and resoundingly himself -- with all his foibles , grievances , fears and desires			1
we thought we 'd be able to call upon his compassion , his intelligence and his energy for as long as there was air and water			0
is @entity3 really dead ? what on @entity176 will the weather be like tomorrow without knowing he 's still around ? see more comedy content at @entity178 .			1

@entity180 : @entity3 ' death seems so implausible . how could he , of all people , stop ?
he says @entity3 was a force of nature who *harnessed* the voices in his head for comedy
he says he was also a good -- sometimes great -- film actor . he empathized with his audience
