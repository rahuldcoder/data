-- the @entity1 could n't do it on its first try			0
in true underdog fashion , @entity6 launched its ultra-budget spacecraft and bested the @entity1 and @entity9 by becoming the first nation to succeed in sending a spacecraft into @entity13 ' orbit on its initial attempt			1
twenty - four hours into @entity6 's entry into the elite space club , the @entity16 , also known as @entity16 , is circling the @entity13 and sending back data and photos to the command center			1
here are five things to know about the latest @entity13 darling : 1			1
how @entity6 kept its @entity13 mission costs low the much - repeated phrase is that the @entity16 at $ 74 million cost less than the $ 100 million budget for the @entity27 space thriller " gravity			1
" at least " gravity " earned a few @entity29			0
@entity6 's @entity13 mission actually cost a lot less than most of this year 's @entity27 summer flops -- some of which you probably do n't remember			1
for example , the budget for @entity38 's flick " @entity37 " could have funded two @entity6 @entity13 mission with its whopping $ 178 million budget			1
@entity6 has built a reputation for its frugal innovations			1
@entity44 explains that the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) was able to save money by using short development cycles and taking advantage of @entity6 's cheap labor market			2
for example , highly - skilled aerospace engineers in @entity6 might receive a salary of $ 1,000 per month , a fraction of what they could earn in @entity9 or the @entity1 2			2
how quickly the @entity13 mission was pulled together @entity6 's then - prime minister @entity56 announced @entity6 's @entity13 aspiration in august 2012			1
in a rapid turnaround , the @entity45 worked at breakneck speed to engineer , assemble and launch the @entity16			2

from announcement to execution , the @entity13 mission took @entity6 's space agency two years and one month			1
in comparison , @entity67 's @entity66 was announced in september 2008 , and reached the planet 's orbit earlier this week -- taking six years			0
in a @entity73 interview from 2013 , @entity45 chairman dr. @entity71 said that @entity6 's space scientists commonly work 18 - hour days and even 20 - hour days during launch period , which made them more time and cost effective			1
the purpose of @entity6 's space mission the @entity13 spacecraft will orbit the @entity13 , mapping its surface and studying the atmosphere			1
the observation has already begun using its scientific instruments , according to @entity45			0
for much of its 50 - year history , @entity6 's space program has prioritized developing technological capacity to help its population , such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites			2
@entity6 's space program launched its first @entity93 satellite in 1975 and put an unmanned probe into orbit around the @entity96 in 2008			2
it 's winning the internet these days , if your spacecraft does n't have a social account with a quirky personality , it might as well not exist			0
the @entity16 's new @entity103 account casually greeted @entity67 's @entity104 , " @entity105 ... keep in touch			0
" it joined an elite club of recent space darlings like @entity67 's @entity104 and @entity112 's defunct @entity96 rover @entity110 , whose popularity soared due to a blend of cheeky and scientific social media posts			0
it 's not without controversy in a country where one in three people lacks basic amenities like electricity , not all could cheer @entity6 's interplanetary aspirations			0
the statistics are sobering : one out of three malnourished children in the world lives in @entity6			0
it faces development , poverty , education and gender challenges			0
some critics have said that @entity6 should channel its funds into helping people here on @entity93			0
and another criticism is that one of @entity93 's biggest environmental offenders has ignored the costs to the planet to go explore another .			0

@entity16 is pride of @entity6 after its *successful* entry into @entity13
@entity16 has sent back its first images of the surface of @entity13
mission cost less than was spent to produce @entity27 film " gravity "
