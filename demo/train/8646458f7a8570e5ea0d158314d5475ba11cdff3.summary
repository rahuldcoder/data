-- on thursday , secretary of defense @entity1 announced that the @entity3 administration would allow women to be placed in positions that will expose them more directly to fighting with enemy ground forces			1
it is said that this will allow women to fill hundreds of thousands of combat roles from which they are currently excluded			1
substantively , this is a poor idea			2
furthermore , the decision - making process used to bring this change about is deeply flawed			1
@entity15 's ongoing war against terror - supporting states and terror networks , commenced after 9/11 , has seen an increased combat role for women in the @entity15 armed forces			1
according to recent news accounts , more than 800 have been wounded and more than 130 have died			0
clearly , women have fought honorably , bravely and with great distinction			2
the greater inclusion of women has allowed our armed forces to tap into an enormous pool of talent and character			1
and as the casualty figures above indicate , the current posture of the @entity15 armed forces is not one in which women are leading cloistered , sheltered lives			1
they are often exposed to great danger			0
so , what is it then that president @entity3 and @entity1 are doing ? under the policy , women may end up being placed in infantry and @entity40 battalions and other front line combat units			1
to doubt the wisdom of this action does not reflect on the courage or abilities of female service members			0
but the step crosses a line worthy of greater deliberation and public debate			0
opinion : the challenge of incorporating women into the infantry the proof that this decision is ideologically and not militarily based is its very sweeping nature			1
it appears that the people who did this are engaged in a vast social experiment in which hundreds of thousands of men and women will be the guinea pigs			1
we are now testing a hypothesis that may impair the military effectiveness of our ground forces			1
the slots that may be opened are in our infantry and @entity40 units			2
the purpose of such units is to directly and physically engage enemy forces			2
this can often involve personal , hand - to - hand combat in which women will now have to fight men			1
these units can often be deployed in prolonged operations that can last for months			0
the physical toll is constant and wearing			0
during operations of this kind there is typically no access to a base of operations or facilities			0
consequently , living conditions can be abysmal and base			0
there is routinely no privacy or ability to maintain personal hygiene for extended periods			0
soldiers and @entity96 have to relieve themselves within sight of others			0
think back to those scenes of combat in @entity101 , the @entity102 in @entity103 , or the frozen mountains of @entity105			2
it is n't pretty , and the same is happening now in @entity107			0
@entity108 : a more equal military ? bring back draft this combat environment -- now containing males and females -- will place a tremendous burden on combat commanders			2
not only will they have to maintain their focus on defeating the enemy in battle , they will have to do so in an environment that combines life - threatening danger with underlying sexual tensions			0
this is a lot to ask of the young leaders , both men and women , who will have to juggle the need to join and separate the sexes within the context of quickly developing and deadly situations			2
is the experiment worth placing this burden on small unit leaders ? i think it is asking too much			2
something as momentous as this should be endorsed by the @entity137			1
ideas like these have been percolating within corners of the @entity141 for years waiting to be unleashed			0
one study by the @entity143 recommended that " women should be excluded from direct land combat units and positions			1
" now , ideologues within the bureaucracy have prevailed , but a volunteer force has to maintain its legitimacy with the wider public			0
that is why the @entity153 gives the @entity137 the power to shape and structure the military			1
i worry about the women who are currently in the military			2
they have to know that the lines keeping them from infantry and @entity40 battalions will get blurrier and blurrier			2
what protections will they have against being thrown into front - line infantry units as organizational dividers soften and expectations change ? very little protection , i am afraid			0
will they leave the military ? this policy change may have the ironic effect of forcing women to reconsider their place in the armed services			0
if true , that would be tragic			0
by the numbers : women in the @entity15 military @entity137 should examine what the @entity141 is doing here -- really			1
the @entity137 must do some hard , nonideological work and assess job categories and physical requirements			1
perhaps a special committee could be formed whose members actually served in the infantry and @entity40			1
if it will not reverse the policy , then @entity137 needs to put in place a comprehensive , nonpoliticized system that will track the physical effects of these changes on women			1
the data needs to be made public , so there can be a fair , scientific assessment of this great experiment			0
president @entity3 and @entity1 have their agenda of change and transformation			0
the @entity15 public , however , should not sit back and leave the brave members of our armed forces susceptible to the whims of ideology			0
men and women can serve together in the armed forces productively , but that service needs to be prudently structured in a manner that reflects the differences between the sexes and the power of their attractions			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			1

*lt.* gen. @entity220 : allowing women to fill combat roles is a deeply flawed idea
he says women already serve ably without being placed in infantry , special forces
he says move an untenable social experiment that will affect effectiveness of ground forces
@entity220 : @entity137 should form committee to examine impact of this decision on the ground
