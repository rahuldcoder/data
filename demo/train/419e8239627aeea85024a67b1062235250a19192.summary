when he joined his large family for the first @entity3 of @entity5 in july , filmmaker and photographer @entity0 did not expect to find himself explaining to a hostile group why he had helped organize the sit - in at the @entity8 in @entity9 and had marched on june 30 to oust @entity11 president @entity10			1
indeed , the conflict within @entity0 's own family is playing out in homes across @entity11			1
it represents a secular vs. @entity17 confrontation of beliefs and visions for @entity11 and is a microcosm of the clashes and violence rocking the nation as followers of ousted president @entity10 fight the army and its secular supporters			1
as the death toll from wednesday 's crackdown on @entity31 and @entity33 camps , and friday 's " @entity34 , " approaches 600 , much more is at stake than the presidency			2
@entity11 's very identity is being contested			1
@entity0 's grandfather is a founder of the radical @entity40 movement , and his uncle and cousins are dedicated members of the @entity45 camp of @entity10 supporters ; the filmmaker found himself outnumbered at his family 's gathering			2
but still he took the floor to explain his actions			0
he and other cultural leaders had occupied the @entity53 in the runup to june 30 protests , he said , to defend @entity11 culture for future generations , and to show that music , dance and theater were not haram ( sinful ) , as @entity61 had claimed , but part of the @entity11 lifeblood			1
@entity0 and other artists joined with the @entity66 rebellion movement for the sake of a better future for the youth , he said			0
" the next generation has the right to lead a good life and to have better conditions than we have , " he explained to his family			2
@entity0 's mother also seeks a better future for @entity11 , but through different means			1
she says she believes that an @entity17 state , such as that reflected in the @entity82 fundamentalism of her one - time home of @entity85 , offers the best hope for @entity11			1
to her , supporting the @entity87 means following @entity61 , and she can not imagine a better path			0
these deep divisions mirror those in families throughout @entity11 , and led to the 2012 protests outside the presidential palace			1
this is more than a dispute about political systems ; it is an emotional debate that cuts to the core of being @entity11			1
" they ( the @entity87 ) tried to change our identity " is an accusation made by @entity11 of all walks of life -- including cab drivers , actors such as @entity104 , and veteran politicians such as @entity106			1
political scientist @entity110 described feeling like an " alien in my own country " when it was under @entity87 control			0
one aspect of the @entity11 identity has been peaceful coexistence with @entity118 , who are now under attack			1
a violent assault on churches and @entity124 businesses was launched on thursday , and in news reports was portrayed as a @entity87 - led reaction to the crackdown on the @entity45 and @entity129 protest camps in @entity9			0
when i went to the @entity133 earlier this week , one of the occupiers delivered this summary message in @entity135 , " anti-coup ; restore @entity10 ; down with @entity124			0
" not surprisingly for the media savvy @entity87 , the huge banners in @entity137 above the entrance to the camp proclaimed the first two items , but not the third			2
at the same time , supporters of the @entity87 , like @entity0 's mother , say they feel betrayed by democracy			2
" where is my voice ? " she asked her son , when he indicated that the legitimately elected president @entity10 would not return to power			0
the @entity11 media 's slanted reports in the weeks since @entity10 's arrest have deepened the rift between the secularists and the @entity61			1
state and @entity155 private channels demonize the @entity87 and anyone who supports it			0
@entity158 politicians such as @entity159 and @entity160 , who urged restraint in dealing with the camps in @entity45 and @entity129 , have been pilloried in the media			2
this steady drumbeat of media attacks on both the " terrorist " @entity87 camps and on anyone who questions their eradication has produced a climate of dehumanization , reflected in the widespread acceptance of the military regime 's violent attack			1
in a shrewd move , gen. @entity175 , @entity11 's military ruler , called citizens into the street weeks ago to support his fight against " potential terrorism			1
" hundreds of thousands or people , including revolutionaries and liberals , heeded his call , making @entity185 -- bizarrely -- the locus of an @entity190 , pro-military love fest. the outpouring of support insulated @entity191 from domestic criticism of the brutal crackdown that followed			1
government officials and ordinary @entity11 dismiss international condemnations of the violence			1
a member of the current government who asked not to be named , given the volatile climate , told me that the military tried every option to bring the @entity87 to the table before attacking the camps			0
while " any form of violence is regrettable , " he believes that , with @entity87 strongholds disbanded , @entity11 will have reached a " new phase " and will be able to move forward positively in the future			2
whether this is possible remains an open question			0
one ray of hope can be found in the generation gap that exists within families , within the @entity87 , and within the secularists			1
back to @entity0 's family and the politicized @entity3			0
after @entity0 had defended his beliefs before his @entity17 elders , his younger - generation cousins took him aside to confess that they agreed with him			1
in fact , they told him they all had signed the @entity66 petition , and some had marched on june 30			0
but none dared confront the senior members of the family with this information			0
within the @entity87 , a similar divide between generations exists			0
attempts to innovate and open @entity87 media and communications have met with approval from the under - 40 generation as well as growing audiences , but have been censured by elders , according to a source familiar with the situation , who asked not to be named			2
so far , the elders have won			0
if and when the next generation takes over , and positions are moderated , the deep rift between the @entity61 and secularists may be healed			0
then perhaps the project of the revolution will be renewed			0
but , for now , the seniors are in charge			0
to quote the @entity11 scholar @entity256 , " there is a rewind of the @entity251 narrative " -- referring to the @entity11 president @entity251 , who seized power in a coup and cracked down on the @entity87 decades ago			2
he added : " the people have chosen security over liberty			0

@entity261 : the @entity17 vs. secular conflict is playing out in @entity264 families
she says it 's a microcosm of conflict over @entity11 identity playing out in street chaos
she says both sides being " played " by @entity191 , media , who dehumanize *opponents*
@entity261 : best hope is that coming , more moderate , generation can heal rifts
