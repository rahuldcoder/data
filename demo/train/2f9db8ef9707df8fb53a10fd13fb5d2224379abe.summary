-- some fashionistas will look to the runway for inspiration as @entity4 kicks off in @entity5 this week			1
others will simply turn on the tv			0
characters ' wardrobes have been used to dictate more than just a setting or a character 's frame of mind arguably since @entity14 transformed @entity18 's " @entity17 " into a live - action fashion magazine in the ' 90s			1
but as many of the notable costume designers making their mark on fall tv will tell you , clothes and accessories have always played an integral part in the storytelling process			1
@entity27 outfits the cast of @entity30 's " @entity29 " with more than 20 years under her undoubtedly stylish belts			1
@entity27 says the key to costuming the @entity34 - set drama , which follows @entity35 ( @entity36 ) as she takes vengeance on the people who destroyed her family , is sticking to pieces that are " simple yet elegant			1
" " the clothes are really important because it shows we 're not in @entity5 ( @entity44 )			0
it shows that we 're not in the @entity46			0
we 're not in @entity47 , " @entity27 said			1
" what i try to do is really place us in that particular world			1
you know , ' am i going to go golfing today ? am i going to go sailing today ? ' " so despite what @entity27 is drawn to on the runway , she 'll stick to pieces that make sense for the show and on each actor 's body			1
" i will always end up pulling from runways or collections what works for my actors versus what the trend is at the moment , " she said			0
" if my actor can not wear that great dropped - waist dress that 's happening out there right now for summer , i ca n't put it on her			1
... i would n't want to send her onto the set in something that 's not flattering			1
" viewers will be well into fall by the time " @entity29 's " second season premieres on september 30			1
on - screen , however , summer will just be underway			0
that 's one reason @entity27 stocks the wardrobe in the months leading up to production , while the weather is still warm			1
" we 're going to probably film summer up until , i 'd say @entity85			0
... throughout the ( tv ) season , there are some designers i can work with that i know keep a summary feel , " she said , adding she often dresses the youngest @entity86 , @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , in @entity89 and @entity90			0
what else can fans expect to see ? " not necessarily the color block , but the mixing of solids and patterns , " @entity27 said			1
" textures are really important , as well as the bright colors , which work well for summer in the @entity34			0
" but not every character will be rocking feel - good hues			0
there 's " trouble in paradise " as the season premieres , she said , and viewers can expect to see that reflected in the color palette			1
even @entity36 , who @entity27 routinely dressed in " spotless white " last season to embody " the ultimate @entity34 princess , " might be wearing more tans , grays and denim blues			1
" ( i 'm ) keeping that darker layer on top so that it 's almost an emotional layer between her and the rest of the world , " she said			2
rarely dressed in white is @entity123 , played by @entity125 actress @entity124			0
@entity124 , who writes about fashion on her personal blog , told @entity0 , " we try to make it clear that ( my character is ) not from the @entity34			0
she 's a @entity131 girl who then moved to @entity5 , who now works in the @entity34			2
i think we try to give her a little bit more edge			0
i 'm very anti-beach attire , so there 's never any of that			2
" and though @entity124 admires some of the pieces in @entity123 's closet , she said she would never wear them off set			2
" it 's bad enough we have the same name , i do n't want to be wearing the same clothes , as well , " she said			2
and then there 's the fact that her character is " far preppier than i am , because she has a job that kind of links her to the corporate world in some capacity and i do n't			2
" @entity124 's character will continue to be the trendiest of all the @entity154 on " @entity29 , " but her style is certainly evolving			2
having been hired by @entity86 at the end of last season , the actress said @entity123 will pick up some higher - end pieces to reflect her new paychecks			0
" i have my eyes on ( @entity163 's ) @entity162 ( for @entity124 ) because it 's kind of firm			2
it 's almost work oriented , but it comes in so many bright colors that it 's also edgy , " she said told @entity0 before " @entity29 " started filming its second season			2
the @entity162 , with a price tag of more than $ 1,000 , did n't make it on the show			0
instead , @entity124 and costume designer @entity27 settled on a @entity172 bag for the character			1
and just as much thought goes into the male characters ' outfits			2
fan favorite @entity177 ( @entity178 ) showed up in the pilot episode -- costumed by @entity180 -- wearing a sailor cap and whale - printed pants			1
as the purveyor of the whale cam , @entity177 's sea creature - themed wardrobe was merely a coincidence , said @entity27 , who took over as costume designer by the series ' second episode			1
" that 's kind of his idea of , ' yeah , i 'm wearing the cool , preppy stuff			2
' but he does n't quite get it right , " @entity27 added			1
" we wanted to keep quirkiness to him , " she said			0
" keep an eccentricity to him , but not make him a caricature			0
... now that he 's been spending more time around the @entity34 , he might start to pick up more information about how stuff fits			2
" @entity208 's character @entity207 , whose plane crashed at the end of the first season finale , will also dress differently this season			1
that is , if she 's to return			2
like @entity36 , @entity207 would dress " a little bit darker , " which works because " ( @entity208 ) can wear black and dark red like nobody else i know , " @entity27 said			1
though , the quality and quantity of the @entity86 matriarch 's wardrobe will likely remain unchanged			0
" in some of these episodes , both @entity36 and @entity207 have , like , 10 changes each , " @entity27 said			1
" so if i 'm dealing with dresses that are $ 3,000 , for two characters that 's $ 60,000 just for those			0
" that 's why it 's sometimes advantageous for @entity27 to dress the characters in separates			1
and , of course , hold onto jeans , slacks and skirts that can be worn again or transformed			0
" we end up dropping a lot of necklines , if a neckline is too high for somebody , " @entity27 said			1
" i have an incredible cutter - fitter who will take a dress we know is a perfect silhouette for @entity207 , and we will make it up in a couple of different colors and different fabrications , and change the necklines and sleeve lengths			1
" needles and thread come out a lot , actress @entity124 said , noting , a lot of work goes into making sure everything fits perfectly			0
" ( @entity27 ) likes making something ( into ) something new , " she said			1
" we 've turned dresses into tops			0
if she loves something , especially with the summer clothes going out of the stores , she 'll buy it in whatever size is available , and then she 'll cut it down to fit me			0
" so what 's @entity124 excited to don this season ? " there 's a @entity270 dress i 'm really looking forward to wearing			0
a @entity272 yellow number that i 'm really looking forward to wearing , " she said			0
" there has to be an occasion			0
... but there 'll always be a @entity34 cocktail party			0
