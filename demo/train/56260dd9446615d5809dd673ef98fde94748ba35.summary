@entity0 our first 2015 trip around the " @entity5 " table brought fresh insights on president @entity8 's early moves , key intelligence on @entity11 congressional shifts , some @entity13 intrigue and a look back that perhaps has a parallel to the angst some liberals have about their 2016 front - runner			1
the ' big speech ' is n't what it once was , so @entity8 hits the road a post-state of the @entity24 road trip is a presidential tradition , but @entity8 is planning a pre-speech swing , perhaps to show the times are changing			0
@entity28 of @entity29 says it 's the latest attempt by the @entity31 to maximize its political leverage -- all the more important now that @entity11 will control both the @entity31 and the @entity33			1
" the @entity31 says that this is a way to get out there , gain momentum and draw up contrasts with @entity11 early on			0
but it also shows that @entity39 simply are n't as important as they once were , " said @entity28			0
" the president 's last @entity24 address drew 33 million viewers			2
it was the lowest number of viewers since @entity46 's last address			2
you still get a big audience , but i think this is interesting , whether this signals that not only this @entity31 but future @entity52 will see an incentive in talking to the @entity55 people about @entity24 ideas separate from just that one big night			0
easy sailing for ag choice @entity58 ? attorney general @entity60 has few , if any , friends among @entity11 in @entity62 , and there were predictions of a rocky road for the woman chosen by @entity8 to take the reins at @entity68 now that @entity60 is stepping down			1
but the @entity70 's @entity69 tells us that smooth sailing is now the prediction as @entity58 prepares for her confirmation hearings			1
yes , @entity11 have some big policy differences with the @entity8 administration and will use the @entity58 hearings to air them			1
but @entity69 says her reporting found that @entity58 herself has made a very good impression on key @entity80			1
" she impressed a lot of @entity11 in her meetings on the hill last month , " said @entity69			0
" sen. @entity85 , who 's the incoming chairman of the @entity86 , has n't said anything negative about her			2
senior @entity11 sources in the @entity33 tell me they think there may be a little bit of drama but right now she 's looking pretty good for confirmation			2
@entity96 's plans for @entity98 's old committee the new @entity62 means some new faces leading key congressional committees , and rep. @entity96 of @entity101 can be certain of this : he will be compared early and often to his combative predecessor , rep. @entity98 of @entity104			1
@entity96 is about to take over the @entity105 , the panel that for the past couple of years has held high - profile hearings on the @entity109 , @entity110 , and other flashpoints between the @entity80 and the @entity8 @entity31			1
@entity96 has a more easygoing style than @entity98 but is no less ambitious -- and no fan of the @entity31			1
@entity114 of the @entity115 shared his reporting on how the new chairman plans to close down some investigations , but then get busy with a new set of oversight priorities			0
" he 's putting together a bunch of new subcommittees -- one to look at @entity8 's work on energy and the environment and another focused specifically on administrative rules , or all the regulation - writing that is going on across the administration , " said @entity114			2
" he says staffers on that subcommittee are tasked with waking up every morning , scouring the @entity132 and all the other pieces of information that are out there about rule - making going on , and hold hearings about them			0
one big question for 2016 -- will @entity139 take the plunge ? in @entity0 , the big 2016 debate is over when @entity142 will let us know for certain			1
but in @entity13 , it 's @entity139 who has things in a bit of a holding pattern			2
@entity139 , a @entity148 @entity55 senator , is looking hard at heading home and running for governor in 2016			0
@entity151 of the @entity115 took us inside the chess game that could play out if @entity139 shakes up state politics with a gubernatorial bid			0
" she 's not up for @entity33 until 2018 , so if she runs for governor in 2016 , she can also keep her @entity33 seat , " said @entity156			2
" but if she wins , she could actually appoint her successor			0
and @entity11 in @entity13 are nervous about that prospect and making some noise and putting bills forward to prevent that little technicality , so she would n't be able to do that			0
@entity46 and @entity165 -- this 2016 dynamic has a 1992 parallel another big 2016 debate in @entity0 is whether liberals can somehow convince sen. @entity169 of @entity170 to challenge @entity142 for the @entity148 presidential nomination			1
i vividly recall a similar debate back in late 1991 and early 1992 , when then - @entity174 gov. @entity46 was emerging as the @entity148 front - runner and annoying some party activists with his argument that @entity148 were repeatedly losing presidential elections because the national party was far too liberal			2
back then , the liberal at the receiving end of the urgent entreaties was @entity184 gov. @entity183			1
among those most aggressive on courting @entity183 were the labor unions that @entity46 often blamed for pulling democrats to the left			1
on deadline day to file for the @entity192 primary , there was a plane waiting in @entity194 , @entity184 , to take @entity183 to @entity195 to declare his candidacy and join the fray			1
reporters waited , and a crowd gathered as word spread of the expected drama			0
i remember sitting in the @entity195 bureau of @entity29 and filing the bulletin that @entity183 would not run			1
and on that day and in the days that followed , i recall the relief his decision gave to top lieutenants in the @entity46 campaign			0
the principal reason @entity46 survived the roller coaster of character questions in that ' 92 campaign was his own political skills and tenacity			0
but it is also fair to note that it turned out to be a relatively weak @entity148 field			0
no offense to @entity220 , @entity221 or the late @entity222 , but none emerged as a lasting , serious threat to @entity46			0
@entity225 -- then the former @entity104 governor and now back in that job -- held on the longest , but never came close in the delegate chase			0
@entity183 's decision kept on the sidelines a powerful intellect with proven debate skills -- and earned the @entity184 governor the " @entity236 on the @entity238 " moniker because of his public debate , largely with himself , over whether to run for president in 1988 and then again in 1992 .			1

@entity169 's impact on @entity142 camp recalls @entity183 in 1992
