-- the tragic death of much loved actor and comedian @entity3 took the world by surprise			1
there has been a steady stream of news reports -- at first conveying shock and disbelief then , disappointingly , moving on to salacious speculation about the cause and method of his death			1
media coverage of mental health and suicide has come a long way over the last few years however , on this occasion ; many newspapers got it badly wrong			2
in @entity22 , some journalists went too far and breached the @entity23 , the ethical standard on press reporting that states that " when reporting suicide , care should be taken to avoid excessive detail about the method used			1
" many of the tabloids and online reports gave unnecessary detail			1
part of the reason is that the @entity35 police spokesperson put into the public domain far more detail than would be the norm in the @entity22 , @entity39 or @entity40			1
when explicit descriptions which illustrate the method used are put in the public domain we know that this can have devastating consequences and lead to acts of imitation			0
there have been many research studies presenting evidence for this and the tragic events in @entity54 should have been a valuable lesson for the media in the need for safe reporting			1
when a media report describes clear details of unusual methods of suicide and essentially gives a " how to " guide -- the danger is it can make suicide seem like a more accessible action to take			2
opinion : why @entity3 lost to depression the media also oversimplified the reasons @entity3 took his own life -- for example highlighting money problems -- when we know that there is no one reason people choose to take their lives			1
the reasons are varied and complex			0
concerning too is the effect that wall - to - wall media coverage about a celebrity suicide can have on the public			2
however unintentionally , it can appear to glamorize and romanticize the incident			0
one of the most well documented examples of the copycat effect of a celebrity suicide was that of @entity90			0
during the month of her suicide in august 1962 there were an additional 303 suicides , an increase of 12 %			0
suicide is a sensitive and complicated subject which affects a huge number of people			0
this is why , when news of @entity3 ' death first broke , we issued a briefing to all newsdesks which provided advice on how to report suicide in a sensitive , and responsible , way			1
we followed it up with a second briefing the next afternoon			0
we urged journalists to consult @entity112 media guidelines , this resource has been produced in conjunction with journalists and has been welcomed by editors			1
while we appreciate journalists have a hugely difficult task presenting breaking news to readers quickly and concisely against increasingly tight deadlines , accuracy and sensitivity can not take a back seat			1
when journalists are writing pieces they should always consider the impact that the tone , content , prominence and imagery of their story will have on their audience			1
opinion : suicide does n't set you free i have been asked a lot over the last few days why certain aspects of a death by suicide should not be reported			2
in short it 's to keep people , who may be struggling with their mental health , safe			0
we know that around 6,000 people take their own life every year in the @entity22 , and thousands more will attempt suicide , seriously contemplate it and battle mental health problems			1
when done correctly , media coverage can be incredibly powerful in helping people to seek support and advice			2
it can also contribute towards changing public attitudes towards mental health problems and reducing the stigma that sadly still exists			0
we are hopeful that there is willingness in the media industry to listen and act on the concerns raised by the mental health charities , experts and their own audiences			0
social media is giving readers a voice like never before and editors now know quickly when they are out of step with the public mood			0
we believe we can work collaboratively with the media to make mental health and suicide reporting safe			2
