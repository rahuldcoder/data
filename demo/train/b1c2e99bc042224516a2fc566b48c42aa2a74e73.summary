-- @entity1 plans to boost its official defence budget by 11.2 per cent this year as @entity3 is balancing the modernisation of its armed forces against the need to keep military spending in line with economic development			1
defence expenditure is budgeted to rise to @entity13 ( $ 110bn ) in 2012 , @entity10 , spokesman of the @entity11 , told reporters a day before @entity1 's rubber stamp parliament opens to hear premier @entity17 's budget report			1
the rate of increase is slightly lower than last year 's 12.7 per cent but in line with the growth trajectory over the past two decades			1
@entity1 has reported double - digit increases in official military spending for each year since 1989 except for 2009 , when the announced growth rate dropped to 7.5 per cent			1
@entity3 says it is committed to keeping military spending in line with the overall pace of economic development			2
foreign analysts agree that @entity3 's official defence budget does not represent the full amount @entity1 spends on the military , but most external estimates still assume that the overall growth trajectory of military spending is in line with the announced figure			1
the @entity37 , one of the most respected independent research institutions , estimates that the official figure accounts for about 60 per cent of @entity1 's total military spending			2
some of the remaining funds are for the @entity43 , a force directly under central government orders which has a separate budget , and the militia , which is partly funded by local governments			0
the @entity50 analysts say the biggest uncertainty is hidden in research and development and acquisitions of new weapons systems			0
in general , the @entity1 government lists soldiers ' pay , training and maintenance , and equipment costs as the three areas on which its military budget is spent			0
in a departure from this terse formula , mr @entity10 claimed that the official number included all other spending			0
" spending on the research , testing , acquisition , maintenance , transport and storage of equipment , including new weapons systems , are also included in the defence budget figure which is announced every year , " he said			2
independent defence experts doubt this claim as they believe the official figure is not enough to cover for the cost of major weapons systems that the @entity81 has under development or which it has started deploying			0
last year , the @entity81 finished refurbishment of an old aircraft carrier which it has started using for exercises			0
" given that they 're taking it out for navigation training and that they 're training large numbers of pilots for carrier operations , the cost here has to soar , " said a south - east @entity89 military official in @entity3			0
the @entity1 military has also started deploying a land - based anti-ship missile with which it intends to limit access for @entity103 carrier groups to regional waters			2
foreign defence experts said the additional radar and satellites needed for accurate targeting were also bound to cause a spike in weapons acquisition cost			0
the 11.2 per cent increase comes as the @entity103 , which has the world 's largest military budget , is cutting defence spending while at the same time shifting its focus to @entity116 , widely seen as an effort to re-assert its regional influence against a rising @entity1			1
over the past year , the @entity120 administration has moved to strengthen military ties with traditional allies in the region including @entity124 , @entity125 and the @entity126			2
@entity128 - east @entity89 countries welcome a stronger @entity103 presence in the region to balance what they see as an increasingly assertive @entity1			0
as @entity3 has stepped up patrols in disputed waters of the @entity133 and continued to add advanced military hardware , neighbours such as @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 have reacted by stepping up weapons purchases themselves			0
for the @entity103 , maintaining its naval presence in @entity116 is more difficult and more costly than for @entity1 -- @entity144 relies on a ' forward ' structure of foreign bases and carrier groups whereas the @entity81 can concentrate on building equipment which will allow it to deny @entity103 forces access to regional waters			1
" it is important to note that @entity3 views itself as reacting to the increasingly assertive policies of other countries and has repeatedly said that it does not want to provoke military confrontation , " said @entity152 , @entity116 analyst at @entity153 's , a leading defence research firm			1
" that said , the increase will be partially motivated by @entity144 's strategic campaign to re-assert itself in @entity116 and will underscore @entity1 's growing means to assert its power over maritime claims in disputed waters of the @entity133 , @entity165 and @entity164			1
" @entity166 's recently forecast the pace of @entity1 defence spending growth to jump to an average 18.7 per cent per year			1
but analysts believe that any bigger increases would have to wait until a new generation of political leaders have taken over			0
@entity173 , the vice president who is expected to succeed @entity174 as president and communist party chief , has much closer ties to the military than mr @entity174			0
however , even next year 's budget will still be drafted under mr @entity174			1
