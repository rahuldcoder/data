@entity0 -- the judge who oversees @entity4 ' conservatorship will consider a request to appoint a conservator to oversee @entity8 's finances and medical care			1
@entity11 judge @entity10 scheduled a hearing for may 2 for the conservatorship petition filed tuesday by @entity14 , @entity8 's daughter			1
the @entity16 - born actress was once one of @entity18 's most glamorous women , but a broken hip and leg amputation in the past two years have left her confined to a bed			2
@entity22 contends that @entity8 's ninth husband , prince @entity23 , is keeping her " increasingly isolated " and " heavily sedated , " and she questions his handling of @entity8 's finances			1
" what ms. @entity14 is seeking here is for the court to make sure that @entity31 's best interests are not being sacrificed for the selfish interests of anyone involved in @entity31 's life , " said @entity22 lawyer @entity26			1
@entity35 , 68 , called a news conference at his home tuesday to dispute the need for a conservator			0
" my wife does n't complain , " he said			2
" she says she 's in a good condition , she feels good			2
" his lawyer , @entity42 , said he had not yet seen the court filing			2
" anything that 's contesting @entity23 's devotion to his wife or his ability to take care of his wife is ridiculous , " @entity42 said the petition questions why @entity23 recently borrowed $ 700,000 on @entity8 's $ 10 million @entity52 mansion , while the house reportedly is in foreclosure after several missed mortgage payments			1
" in spite of her conflicts with @entity23 , @entity14 has been hoping he had @entity31 's interests at heart , " @entity26 said			1
" however , having just recently learned that he took out a $ 700,000 loan , and that there was a notice of default recorded against the property in late february 2012 because he apparently has not been paying @entity31 's mortgage payment , it became clear to @entity14 that if she did not seek to protect her mother , no one else would			1
" @entity35 , at his news conference said his step daughter was picking on him " at the worst time			0
" " we are right now going through a very hard time , my wife and me , " he said			0
" we have to sell our property in order to pay our debts			0
my wife has $ 6 million in debts			0
" he acknowledged taking out the new loan on the property , saying it was needed to pay his wife 's medical bills and to catch up on missed mortgage payments			1
the mansion , however , is not in foreclosure , he said			1
" there was a document filed in court 14 days ago , " he said			0
" it was wrongly filed			0
" @entity22 and @entity23 have publicly battled for several years over @entity8 's finances and her access to her mother			1
" he 's basically taken my mother away from me , " @entity22 told @entity1 in an interview a year ago			1
@entity35 , in an interview with @entity1 , said he limits his step - daughter 's access because she brings negativity into the room			0
" i want smiling people in here , happy smiling people , " he said			0
he defended his care of @entity8 , saying , " i 'm going to make sure she has a good life , as long as i live , i will take care of her			1
" with tuesday 's filing , @entity22 hopes to take that responsibility away from @entity23			1
the family feud intensified after @entity8 broke her hip when she fell in july 2011			2
" my mother 's husband has increasingly isolated my mother from others who have been close to her , " @entity22 said in the court filing			1
" before she broke her hip , my mother and i spoke several times every day			0
since she broke her hip , her husband has removed the telephone that used to be by her bed			0
" @entity35 allows @entity22 , @entity8 's only child , to visit her mother only when a lawyer and doctor are present , she said			1
she became alarmed during her last two visits on november 27 , 2011 , and february 8 , 2012 , " because my mother seemed heavily sedated , and i had not seen her in that state before , " @entity22 said			1
she also raised concern about " remnants of some bedsores " and " lesions on my mother 's face			2
" @entity8 's right leg was amputated a year ago because of gangrene , leaving her unable to care or dress herself , she said			1
@entity22 's petition calls for " competent and independent medical professionals " to advise on her care			2
" i am very concerned that her medical needs and treatment are not being managed in her best interest			0

he is currently an announced candidate for mayor of @entity0			0
he made news several years ago when he claimed to be the father of @entity153 's daughter after the actress 's death			0
paternity tests later disproved that claim			0
last year , @entity23 announced that he wanted @entity8 to become a mother again using an egg donor , artificial insemination and a surrogate mother			1
" that 's just weird , " @entity22 said at the time			0
" i 'm a retired guy , " @entity23 said then			2
