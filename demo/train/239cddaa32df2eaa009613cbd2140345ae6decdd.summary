@entity0 has been accused of kowtowing to the @entity2 government by pulling from its @entity3 a product enabling users to circumvent firewalls and access restricted sites			1
@entity10 , a free app that provides users a randomized ip address to keep their browsing habits anonymous and shielded from censors , was removed after the tech giant deemed it contained " illegal content , " the app 's lead developer told @entity17			1
it remains available in @entity19 outside @entity2			0
the developer -- who wished to remain anonymous , saying that " as the developers of an app that protects users ' privacy and anonymity online , it only makes sense to do the same ourselves " -- said @entity0 provided no notification that the app had been pulled , with the developers only learning from consumers			1
when @entity0 responded to @entity10 , they were told only that the app contained content that was illegal in @entity2			1
@entity0 requires developers to comply with legal requirements in all locations in which the product is made available			0
the company did not respond to @entity17 's request for comment			0
@entity10 , a self - described " small team of programmers spread across the world collaborating over the @entity52 , " considers it has reasonable grounds to challenge @entity0 's move , as its product is a browser app and any content accessed through it is at the discretion of the user			1
but the developer said there were no plans to try to force the tech giant into a rethink			2
" unfortunately , we 're not aware of any app developer ever ( successful ) in challenging @entity0 's decision			2
in fact , we wo n't be surprised if @entity0 decides to pull our app from all app stores and / or terminates our account in retaliation ( to publicity over the issue )			0
" the developer said that prior to its removal from @entity0 's @entity3 on july 11 , the app was being downloaded about 2,000 times a day in @entity2 , accounting for about a third of the app 's total downloads			2
the @entity2 government strictly polices internet access , censoring web users and blocking access to sites deemed sensitive			1
@entity2 social media users were critical of @entity0 's move , saying the decision diminished the company 's moral standing , and comparing it unfavorably to @entity87 as a champion of internet freedom			1
" the fruit is contaminated , " wrote a user on the @entity93 - like @entity92 microblog under the handle @ @entity95			0
" where 's your integrity ! " asked @ @entity97			0
" the only one who does n't surrender to evil is my great @entity87 ! " wrote @ @entity101			0
a smaller group were more understanding of the company 's position , however , acknowledging that conforming to @entity2 's censorship policy was the price to pay to do business in the country			0
" @entity0 is determined to do well in @entity2 , " wrote @entity92 user @ @entity114			2
" how can @entity0 step in to the @entity2 market without strict censorship ? how can it do business without showing their sincerity ( to the government ) ? " other apps previously removed from @entity0 's @entity123 in @entity2 for falling foul of censorship laws include one providing access to forbidden books , and a news app for a @entity130 - based broadcaster founded by the banned spiritual group @entity132 .			1
