@entity0 , @entity1 @entity4 chief @entity3 conceded wednesday that his approach to sex is rougher than that of most men , as he took the stand for a second day in his trial in @entity1 on aggravated pimping charges			1
his words followed testimony from two sex workers about his behavior at sex parties he 's accused of organizing or encouraging in @entity17 and the @entity18			1
he denies knowing that the women involved in the parties were prostitutes			0
one , named only as @entity21 , told the court in the northern @entity1 city of @entity0 that @entity3 had " brutal " sexual relations with her and must have known she was being paid			1
a second , named as @entity28 , told the court that she had been subjected to an " unsolicited " sexual act by @entity3 -- who 's commonly known by his initials , @entity3 -- after going to a party at the @entity34 sex club in @entity35			1
" through this trial , i am discovering that my sexuality is perhaps rougher than most men 's sexuality			1
if some women do n't like it , it 's their right			2
but my behavior is the same with all women , " @entity3 said			1
@entity3 , who was married to @entity1 tv journalist @entity45 until their divorce in 2013 , has never denied that he took part in the parties			1
but the crux of his defense is that he did not know prostitutes were involved			0
both @entity21 and @entity28 are plaintiffs in the case			0
@entity28 told the court she had refused to have sex with @entity3 at the @entity34 club , " because it was a butchery			1
" he was allegedly on a mattress with 40 people			0
she later accompanied @entity3 to his hotel at the request of fellow defendant @entity63 , a businessman friend of the former @entity65 director , she said			1
it was there that she was subjected to the unwanted sexual act , she told the court through tears			1
asked by the judge if she had voiced her refusal , @entity28 responded that she did n't have time to say anything			0
@entity3 did n't ask and she would have said no had he done so , she said			1
" had i been a libertine , he would have asked , this seems obvious , " she said , using a term that describes someone who is sexually or morally unrestrained			0
@entity3 on tuesday denied knowing any of the women at the sex parties were prostitutes , saying he was told by @entity63 that they were " libertines " who liked sex			1
she had previously met @entity3 at a hotel in @entity86 , @entity28 said , when he was the only man surrounded by other women in a bed			1
he did not speak to her but treated her " like an object , not as a human being			0
" asked about @entity28 's testimony , @entity3 maintained that he did n't know she was a prostitute , although she mentioned to him that she was performing dances in a swinger club for money			1
the dances were sometimes followed by sexual acts on stage			0
@entity28 later went on a trip to @entity100 as part of a group accompanying @entity3 , the court heard			1
she told the judge that she had agreed to go despite his behavior in @entity35 because she needed the money -- she was paid 2,000 euros ( $ 2,260 ) -- and wanted to see the @entity18 capital			0
" i was there for him , for @entity3			1
i was told so , otherwise why would i go to @entity100 ? no one else was in @entity100 , except him ! " she said of the trip			0
she did not sleep with @entity3 on that trip , she said			1
he approached another woman in the group for sex but was turned down			2
the court also heard excerpts of testimony given previously by two other sex workers , named as @entity118 and @entity119 , who joined a second trip to @entity100 with @entity3			1
@entity118 alleged that @entity3 had asked to see her without @entity63 's group and had inquired about her fees			1
@entity119 's testimony said that @entity118 had told her that			2
questioned about this , @entity3 conceded that he had asked to see @entity118 alone but denied speaking of any remuneration			1
he said that if money was mentioned , it was just to cover her travel expenses			0
the two women had been introduced to @entity3 as secretaries working for a construction company at which another defendant in the case , businessman @entity134 , was employed			2
according to excerpts read out by a magistrate , a witness who was part of that second trip to @entity100 said he had doubts about the professions of @entity118 and @entity119 after spending time with them			0
the next day he allegedly told @entity63 : " you are not going to make me believe they were secretaries			0
never do this again to me ! " @entity3 : i did n't know there were prostitutes at sex parties two women who accompanied @entity3 on a third trip to @entity100 said they considered themselves libertines , not prostitutes , but would not turn down a " present			1
" the women , named @entity155 and @entity156 , said they worked as an assistant film director and a financial counselor and received payment for the trip			0
they were not in court wednesday , but parts of their statements were read aloud by magistrates			2
unlike other women in this case , @entity165 and @entity155 said they did n't perceive any brutality or deviance at the parties			0
when asked whether the men of the group knew of their being paid , @entity165 said , " even if things were n't told , and considering their status and intelligence , it would have been too good to be true			2
" late wednesday , a woman named @entity178 recalled hearing @entity3 say he " loathed whores			2
" that comment came after she wondered aloud about the profession of women at a sex party they 'd both attended , @entity178 said in a statement read in court			2
@entity178 , who said she slept with @entity3 in hopes he 'd help her find work in communications , did not attend the hearing			2
prosecutors say the operations of the prostitution ring , organized from the @entity193 in @entity0 , stretched all the way to @entity195 and @entity100			0
sex workers involved in the parties said they were like orgies			2
in @entity1 , prostitution is legal , but pimping is not			0
in questioning tuesday , @entity3 acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda			2
" but i do n't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever , " he said , adding that he had never asked anyone to organize parties for him			0
he also spoke of his dislike for prostitution and the risks that he considered using prostitutes would pose in terms of his political ambitions			0
prosecutors say @entity63 and @entity134 picked up the bills for the sex parties for their influential friend			0
the prosecutor 's office in late 2013 asked for @entity3 's case to be dismissed , citing lack of evidence			1
however , the investigating magistrates did not follow their recommendations			0
the trial of @entity3 , who saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in @entity195 in 2011 , opened in @entity0 just over a week ago			1
he was later cleared of the @entity195 allegations			0
before that scandal erupted , he had been on track to run for the @entity1 presidency -- an election his @entity236 later won with @entity237 as its candidate			0
@entity2 's @entity239 reported from @entity0 and @entity240 wrote from @entity241 .			0
