@entity0 -- the aging veterans gingerly walk from the plane in the nation 's capital			1
some get pushed in wheelchairs			2
a brass band strikes up @entity10 era tunes			1
strangers rise to their feet and clap their hands			0
" why are they doing this ? " says @entity14 , 86 , a co-pilot on a @entity15 during @entity10 " i feel as humbled as a mouse			1
" @entity18 was overwhelmed as he made his way through the crowd			0
" the chills came over me			0
very seldom do you see something like that , " says the 92 - year - old army veteran			0
these @entity10 veterans have traveled here to visit the @entity28 , which honors the 16 million @entity30 armed forces who served and the more than 400,000 who died in battle			1
the vets made the trip thanks to a former employee at the @entity37			1
a physician 's assistant at the @entity37 in @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 was struck by the @entity10 vets he treated and how few made the journey to see the memorial that honors them			1
" they dedicated the @entity10 memorial in may of 2004 , 60 years after the war had ended			1
that was a cause of celebration in my clinic			0
all of the veterans wanted to see it but they were in poor health or did n't have the means to visit it			2
" " reality set in , " @entity42 says , " they were never going to see their memorial			2
" @entity42 was determined to change that , because he so admired the quiet grit and heroism of the unassuming men he treated every day			0
he took his cause to a local air club			0
" i stood before 150 pilots and told them i was going to start flying @entity10 veterans to @entity0			1
i said if you want to help me , the @entity10 veteran does n't pay a penny			1
you 'll have to rent an airplane and cover all the travel costs			0
" " @entity76 " took to the skies in may of 2005			1
six planes flew 12 veterans			2
the next month , eight planes flew 16 veterans			2
today , it operates like a volunteer airline , with 86 hubs in 33 states			0
instead of renting small planes , they charter @entity88 jets , thanks to donations that keep the planes in the sky			0
so far , more than 30,000 veterans have experienced a visit to the memorial , courtesy of @entity76			1
" witnessing their emotions is what fuels our cause			0
when you see @entity10 veterans break down in tears because they had no idea how much this nation reveres , cherishes and loves them for what they 've done , it really overwhelms them , " @entity42 says			1
in the days and weeks before each @entity76 , an army of ground volunteers coordinates every detail of each trip -- from the buses that pick them up to the meals they eat			1
shortly after @entity119 and his group arrived in @entity0 this day , they were taken by bus to the memorial			1
many said they were stunned by its size and scope			0
inscriptions carved in granite recognize specific battles that were fought in @entity130 and across the @entity131			0
a wall of stars marks the high price of freedom			0
they paused to remember the 448,000 who died in the war -- and their fellow survivors who did n't live to see this moment			0
" each of those stars represents 100 men and women who died in @entity10 , and i realized that my division has almost 39 stars on that wall , " said @entity142 , 85 , who stormed the bullet - ridden beaches on @entity144 as a platoon sergeant with the @entity146			1
@entity42 says the trip often provides closure for the vets who visit			2
many veterans open up at the memorial and speak in detail for the first time about what they went through			2
" i 've had exchanges with veterans that are jaw dropping , " @entity42 says			1
" you ca n't fathom what it 's like to have experienced what they went through fighting for their lives			0
" the same " @entity76 " that transported the veterans to @entity0 returns them back home , landing just 12 hours after it took off			1
the elderly warriors seem renewed rather than exhausted by their whirlwind trip			2
" i will never forget this , " say 86 - year - old @entity177 , who served in the @entity131 on the @entity178			0
" everybody is so happy and treating us so nice			0
" @entity182 , 88 , added , " i feel so fortunate to be here			2
so many did n't make it			0
" for @entity42 , the founder of @entity76 , the end of each flight is a bittersweet experience			1
his mission continues with an air of urgency , because less than 10 percent of the @entity30 who served in @entity10 are still alive			2
an estimated 1,200 @entity10 veterans die every day			1
" in another five to seven years , our efforts will be a moot point because they will be gone or too infirm to participate in a mission like this , " he says .			0

program called @entity76 takes @entity10 vets to see memorial in @entity0

" i 've had exchanges with veterans that are jaw dropping , " founder says
