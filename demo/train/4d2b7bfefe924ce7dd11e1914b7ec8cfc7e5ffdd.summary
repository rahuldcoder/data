-- bird populations native to several areas of the globe are in decline , with some teetering on the brink of extinction , according to a multi-agency report , the first of its kind , released thursday			1
the @entity12 meadowlark is an endangered bird species , according to a new report			1
but some other species are thriving , according to the " @entity22 " report , which credited conservation programs and waterfowl management initiatives that it said can serve as a model in other areas			1
" every @entity29 habitat harbors birds in need of conservation , " said the report , issued by the @entity24 in conjunction with federal agencies and other organizations			1
" @entity33 birds and ocean birds appear most at risk , with populations in danger of collapse if immediate conservation measures are not implemented			2
" of the more than 800 species of birds in the @entity29 , 67 are federally listed as endangered or threatened , the report said			1
another 184 are " species of conservation concern " because they have small distribution , are facing high threats or have a declining population			0
@entity33 birds , particularly , are in crisis , the report said			2
more than one - third of all @entity29 bird species are in @entity53			1
however , 71 species have gone extinct since the islands were colonized about 300 a.d. , and 10 more species have not been seen in the past 40 years , contributing to fears they , too , have died out			0
grassland and arid - land birds are showing the most rapid declines over the last four decades , while forest birds are also declining , the report said			1
" just as they were when @entity67 published ' @entity68 ' nearly 50 years ago , birds today are a bellwether of the health of land , water and ecosystems , " interior secretary @entity63 said thursday in a statement on the report			2
" from shorebirds in @entity76 to warblers in @entity78 to songbirds in @entity53 , we are seeing disturbing downward population trends that should set off environmental alarm bells			0
we must work together now to ensure we never hear the deafening silence in our forests , fields and backyards that @entity67 warned us about			0
" the declines can be traced to a variety of factors , depending on a bird 's particular habitat			0
but the causes most frequently cited in the report are agriculture , climate change , development and energy , and invasive species			1
for instance , some of the nation 's fastest - growing cities -- @entity102 , @entity103 ; @entity105 , @entity106 ; and @entity107 , @entity108 -- are located in arid lands , the report said			2
" unplanned and sprawling urban development is by far the greatest threat to arid lands			0
" in addition , invasive non-native plants have been introduced into the area , which can fuel wildfires and destroy native plants			2
bird species of concern in arid lands include the elf owl , @entity124 's and @entity125 's thrashers and the gilded flicker , the report said			1
some , such as the @entity108 condor , are already listed as endangered or threatened			2
in the grasslands , intensified agricultural practices have hurt bird populations , according to the report			1
" pastures can not support many birds if overgrazed , burned too frequently or burned at the beginning of the nesting season or the end of the grass - growing season			0
" also , public lands and parks are mowed too frequently and the grass kept too short to provide a habitat for birds , the reports said			0
grassland birds showing marked population declines include the mountain plover , @entity149 and @entity12 meadowlarks , short - eared owls and @entity152 bobwhites			0
in the forest , some species are doing well , but roughly one - third of forest - breeding bird species are showing decline			1
the same is true for arctic and alpine birds , where 38 percent of the 85 species are of conservation concern , the report said			1
game birds are also struggling			0
of 19 resident game bird species , 47 percent are species of conservation concern , and two species are federally endangered , according to the report			1
the greatest hope for long - term management of game birds , however , lies in @entity172 programs that retire millions of acres of land used for heavy agriculture , the report said			1
along the coast and in the ocean , bird populations have been hurt by overfishing , pollution and climate change , among other factors , the report said			1
each section of the report contains at least one " reason for hope			0
" the @entity108 condor , for instance , has been reintroduced to some areas , and the bird 's numbers are growing			0
urban birds , such as the @entity29 robin , hummingbirds , sparrows and woodpeckers , show a " steady , strong increase " in the last 40 years			2
" a surprising number of native birds have adapted to life around humans , " the report said			2
" ... the wide variety of native birds that thrive in urban areas underscores the importance of these artificial habitats to the survival of many bird populations			1
" wetland bird populations remain below historic levels , but " management and conservation measures have contributed to increases of many wetland birds , including hunted waterfowl			1
" research shows that wetland bird species began to increase in the late 1970s , " coinciding with major policy shifts from draining to protecting wetlands , " the report said			2
" dramatic increases in many wetland generalist species , as well as arctic - nesting geese and cavity - nesting ducks , contribute to this overall trend			0
" " these results emphasize that investment in wetlands contribution has paid huge dividends , " said @entity227 , director of @entity228 at the @entity229 or @entity230			0
" now we need to invest similarly in other neglected habitats where birds are undergoing the steepest declines			0
" taking action now -- particularly in the area of habitat loss -- can help reverse the declining trend seen in some species , according to the report			0
" the number and scope of severe threats to birds is daunting , but implementing solutions immediately and widely will pay off in benefits to society , the economy and the health of our environment			0
" it calls for measures such as increased monitoring of bird populations , stricter protection laws , more incentives , sustainable fishing practices and widespread education			1
" citizen science plays a critical role in monitoring and understanding the threats to these birds and their habitats , and only citizen involvement can help address them , " said @entity264 , conservation director for the @entity265			0
" conservation action can only make a real difference when concerned people support the kind of vital habitat restoration and protection measures this report explores			0
