from the @entity1 to @entity2 , @entity0 worldwide rejoiced when cardinal @entity3 became the new pope			1
he 's the first @entity5 and the first @entity6 in modern times to lead the world 's 1.2 billion @entity0			2
but in some ways , he 's just a normal guy			2
here are five things to know about @entity3 : 1			1
his name says a lot about him unlike other recent pontiffs -- @entity15 , @entity16 -- pope @entity3 does n't have a numeral after his name			1
that 's because he 's the first to take the name @entity3			1
why @entity3 ? the pope wanted to honor @entity21 , an admirer of nature and a servant to the poor and destitute			1
@entity21 was born the son of a rich cloth merchant			1
but he lived in rags among beggars at @entity31 in @entity32			0
talk back : what kind of spiritual leader will draw people back to organized religion ? those close to @entity3 see similarities between the two men			1
" @entity21 is ... someone who turned his back on the wealth of his family and the lifestyle he had , and bonded with lepers and the poor , " said the rev. @entity39 , the @entity1 's deputy spokesman			1
" here 's this pope known for his care for @entity50 patients and people who are very sick			2
who is known for his concern with single mothers whose babies were refused to be baptized by priests in his diocese			2
" he scolded those priests last year and said , ' how can you turn these people away when they belong to us ? ' " @entity3 , the pontiff of firsts , breaks with tradition 2			1
he 's not actually the first pope from outside @entity66 sure , @entity3 is the first @entity68 pope in modern times			1
but back in the 8th century , a @entity70 -- pope @entity71 -- led the church from 731 to 741 a.d. we 've also had popes from @entity75 ( @entity76 , from 97 to 105 a.d. ) , @entity78 ( pope @entity77 , from 642 to 649 ) and modern - day @entity79 ( @entity81 , from 189 to 199 )			2
several other @entity70 have also been pontiff in the last few millennia			0
of course , the majority of popes have been @entity84			0
but with @entity3 ' appointment , the tide could be shifting to outside @entity66			1
first @entity6 pope ' very exciting , ' faithful say 3			2
he 's a pope of the people in some ways , @entity3 is just a normal guy			1
" the new pope is a very humble man , " said the rev. @entity92 , an @entity93 priest			1
" he takes public transport every day			2
" he also chose to live in an apartment instead of the archbishop 's palace , passed on a chauffeured limousine and cooked his own meals , @entity97 @entity1 analyst @entity96 wrote in a profile published by @entity104			0
in his first public act as pontiff , @entity3 broke with tradition by asking the estimated 150,000 people packed into @entity109 to pray for him , rather than him blessing the crowd first			1
" he is a very simple man , " said @entity111 , auxiliary bishop of @entity112			0
" it 's very clear from the way he approached the people and asked them to bless him and pray for him			0
it 's a beautiful sign of closeness and humility			0
" the pontiff broke with another tradition by refusing to use a platform to elevate himself above the cardinals standing with him as he was introduced to the world as @entity3			1
" he said i 'll stay down here , " said cardinal @entity126 , archbishop of @entity127 and the president of the @entity129			0
" he met each of us on our own level			0
" from public transport to popemobile : @entity3 's journey 4			1
he comes with a side of controversy @entity3 opposes same - sex marriage and abortion , which is n't surprising as leader of the socially conservative catholic church			1
but as a cardinal , @entity3 clashed with the government of @entity93 president @entity146 over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives			1
his career as a priest in @entity93 coincided with the so - called @entity153 -- and some say the church did n't do enough to confront the military dictatorship			1
as many as 30,000 people died or disappeared during the seven - year period that began with a coup in 1976			0
@entity3 , in particular , was accused in a complaint of complicity in the 1976 kidnapping of two liberal @entity5 priests , @entity96 wrote			2
" the best evidence that i know of that this was all a lie and a series of salacious attacks was that @entity172 who investigated that said that was all untrue , " said @entity165 , former @entity166 ambassador to the @entity1			0
" these were unfair accusations of this fine priest			0
" but @entity172 said it did not investigate any individual for their specific involvement			0
" our research focused on the plight of the disappeared , " said @entity179 , media director for @entity172			0
opinion : @entity3 , open up the church 5			2
he faces a host of challenges ahead @entity3 takes the helm of a church that has been rocked in recent years by sex abuse by priests and claims of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy			2
he may need to find a way to draw new @entity0 into the church where it is in decline , said @entity198 , executive director of the @entity199 at @entity200			0
and he 'll also need to find ways of working with shifting viewpoints among @entity0			0
in the @entity166 , for example , 90 % of @entity0 are using contraception and 82 % think it is morally permissible			0
" the church has conservative positions on human sexuality , bioethics , etc. , but liberal positions on issues such as economic regulation , the death penalty and immigration , " @entity198 said			0
" a church divided against itself seems unlikely to renew our political or cultural structures			0
" opinion : @entity219 , authentic and credible			0

@entity3 took his name from @entity21 , a servant to the poor
the @entity93 is not the first pope from outside @entity66
