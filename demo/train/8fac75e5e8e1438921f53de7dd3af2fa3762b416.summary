@entity0 -- ten years after the september 11th attacks , the nation still is n't fully prepared to handle another huge disaster , @entity5 , one of the co-chairmen of the @entity8 , said thursday			1
first responders could still have problems communicating with one another , and there is confusion in some communities about who would be in charge , @entity5 told the @entity17			1
he urged quick action to solve the problems			0
" we can not permit delay of this , " he said			1
" we lost lives at 9/11			0
we lost lives at @entity24 because we were not able to get communication			0
" the @entity8 recommended concerted action to fix the problem of responder communications , but the problem persists			1
" i think it 's an urgent question and shame on us , shame on us if we have not solved this problem when the next disaster strikes , " @entity5 said			1
@entity34 , the first secretary of the @entity35 , said competing measures to deal with the problem are being considered by the @entity17 and @entity37 , while police and fire departments are waiting for some kind of action			1
" all they want is a system , " @entity34 said , " ... the opportunity to get voice and data and video over the broadband " in the event of a terror attack , natural disaster or major accident			2
the committee 's chairman , rep @entity53 , @entity57 - @entity56 , said he continues to believe the answer is to set aside a block of wireless telecommunication bands for an emergency communications network			0
@entity5 said another concern is knowing who is in charge in the event of a disaster			2
he called it a " no - brainer " but added that in metropolitan areas , where many law enforcement and rescue groups would respond in a big emergency , the lines of command are not defined			1
@entity53 held the hearing to assess what progress has been made since the 2001 terror attacks and what still needs to be done			0
he pointed the finger at @entity80 -- where he serves -- for not streamlining congressional oversight of the @entity35			0
" we 're sending mixed signals as far as what @entity80 wants in the area of homeland security , and this fragmentation , to me , is inviting , if not disaster , certainly it 's preventing law enforcement and the intelligence agencies from doing the job to the maximum , " @entity53 said			1
@entity5 also said the @entity94 and other entities have done a great deal of work on technology to detect all types of explosives but " we have to accelerate our efforts " to be able to find bomb materials people carry or could hide inside their bodies			2
@entity34 said the @entity105 has been able to thwart many terror plots , but in some instances it was because the bombers made mistakes and were ineffective			2
" luck is not a strategy , " he said , warning that the @entity105 must adapt to detect the evolving tactics of terrorists			0
@entity5 told the panel much progress has been made in the past 10 years , but more needs to be done : " we are safer today , but not as safe as we could be			0

communication , lines of command remain problem areas , @entity5 says
" we can not permit delay , " says @entity5 , co-chairman of the @entity8
" luck is not a strategy , " says former homeland security chief @entity34
