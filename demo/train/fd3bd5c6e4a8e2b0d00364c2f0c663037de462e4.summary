as the rest of the world rang in 2012 , @entity0 awoke to an unpleasant @entity4 surprise : their government announced the removal of a longstanding fuel subsidy that had helped to hold down gas prices in the largely impoverished country			1
almost overnight , the price of fuel more than doubled , plunging the @entity13 nation into mass unrest and bringing commerce to a standstill			0
@entity0 took to the streets on january 3 in protest against the removal of the fuel subsidy , and alleged corruption in the government of president @entity22			1
the demonstrations swelled a week later , with the backing of several major @entity0 labor unions			0
@entity22 : @entity0 's embattled president as protests spread to every major @entity0 city , @entity27 helped chronicle the unfolding events by telling their stories			1
in the days after the unrest began , @entity0 observing and participating in the street demonstrations submitted more than 500 ireports			1
their pictures and videos gave @entity27 a firsthand look at protesters massing in large street gatherings , often holding signs expressing anger at their government			0
another ubiquitous sight was the piles of burning refuse demonstrators used to shut down street traffic			0
@entity27 on the frontline of protests also played a major role in @entity27 's coverage of last year 's @entity53 and @entity55 movements			0
now , with the protests formally ended but @entity0 reeling from a string of deadly bombing attacks by militant @entity61 group @entity60 , @entity0 ireporters said they wonder what the future will hold for their beleaguered country			1
" hopefully , the protests and conversations are beginning of the ' real ' awakening of @entity0 , " said @entity65 , 31 , of @entity66			2
a @entity0 citizen by birth , she was in @entity72 for a business trip and decided to join the rallies against the sudden increase in fuel prices			0
" the younger generation is itching for change and willing to demand better			0
" @entity79 and other @entity27 said the mass eruption of protests helped raise awareness among @entity0 of their shared frustrations with the country 's overburdened infrastructure and lack of social services			1
she said she believes protesters were ultimately failed by the trade unions ' compromise with the government , which saw the formal end of the nationwide strike			0
@entity27 photos : putting a face on @entity0 's " paradise lost " still , @entity79 said she remains optimistic that these protests have sparked a larger movement for democratic change in the country			1
that 's a sentiment echoed by other @entity0 ireporters , who also expressed frustration over the compromise that saw the partial reinstatement of the country 's fuel subsidy			1
and like @entity79 , they said they view the recent wave of protests as a turning point in their nation 's history			1
" the protests also served as one united platform for all types of @entity0 , " said pharmacist @entity119 , 24 , of @entity120			2
" at a time where the country is much divided and ( fractured ) by sectarian and religious unrest , it also sent a message to the government that the people know their rights and are ready to fight for them			0
" @entity119 said he hopes that his children will someday see a more democratic @entity0 and that he 'll be able to tell them about the time he went into the streets to protest			2
but the country faces many obstacles in the near future , not the least of which are the recent bombings by @entity60			2
@entity141 , 27 , said he believes the recent protests and violence may end up uniting two of the country 's most fractious factions : muslims and @entity148			1
during the demonstrations he witnessed in @entity150 , " people wept when they saw the @entity148 guarding the @entity147 as they prayed , and vice versa , " @entity141 said			0
" we believe it is a tremendous steppingstone for @entity0 to unite against their oppressor			0
" the protest has also instilled in the heart of uneducated @entity0 the attitude of seeking of political and economic information of the state of the affairs of their country			1
" most @entity0 ireporters expressed the shared hope their country is moving in the right direction , slowly but surely			1
" it 's safe to say that @entity0 is on the right path once again , even if the journey is still slow and seemingly boring , " said freelance journalist @entity167 , 21 , of @entity72			2
" the protests have kick - started the national consciousness and revitalized the @entity0 spirit of never say never			2
as a @entity0 proverb goes , ' a clap begins the dance			0

@entity0 reels from a recent protest movement and terrorist bombing attacks
ireporters on the frontlines offer their views of the unrest
despite violence , @entity0 say they remain hopeful about their country 's future
activists say they hope protests will mark a turning point in @entity0 's history
