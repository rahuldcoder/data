-- " every day and every night i want to see you and be with you			2
yet i have no feeling of selfish ownership or jealousy			2
" in fact i should always want you to live just as you wanted -- because if you did n't you would change and would n't be you			2
let 's go for a long ride sundays ; let 's go to the mountains weekends ; let 's read books in front of fires ; most of all , let 's really grow together and find the happiness we know is ours			1
" the dewy - eyed romantic writing those words ? @entity19			1
on friday the first in a series of handwritten love letters between a young @entity19 and a young @entity23 went on display at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
the letters began in 1938 -- when they met while auditioning for a community play -- and extended almost up until their wedding day two years later			1
former president @entity19 died in 1994 , the year after @entity23 's death			1
she would have been 100 this month			2
the exhibit at the @entity25 featuring the love letters will almost certainly reignite the debate about the most controversial and enigmatic @entity37 political figure of the last hundred years			1
who -- not only in the end , but at the beginning -- was @entity19 ? for all his fame , did anyone truly know him ? most @entity37 adults long ago made up their minds about what they think of @entity19 , pro or con			1
but , with the new focus this month on the @entity25 and @entity49 , i hope that at least some of you will someday make the trip to @entity26 , will leave your political passions at the door for a bit , and will take in something that is absolutely haunting in its quiet power			2
i have done reporting and research at four presidential libraries , and the part of the @entity25 i 'd like to recommend to you is by far the most memorable aspect of any of them			2
maybe because it is so unexpected			2
it 's not inside the library itself ; it 's on a side lawn it is a small house			1
the house where @entity19 was born			1
it is not a replica			0
it has not been reconstructed or moved from somewhere else			0
it is the house where @entity19 lived for the first nine years of his life			1
the @entity25 and @entity49 was built on the site of the former lemon grove where his father , @entity80 , tried and failed to make a decent living			0
@entity83 built the house by hand , from a kit			0
the wood , nails and fittings , ordered from a catalog , arrived at the train station and @entity19 's dad , before the boy was born , put it together			1
it is so cramped and claustrophobic			1
that 's what strikes you when you enter the front door			1
you ca n't just wander through by yourself ; volunteer docents at the library accompany you			1
six people lived in the house : mr. and mrs. @entity19 , @entity105 and three of his brothers			1
two of them would die from illnesses contracted in childhood ; a fifth boy would be born after the @entity113 moved away from @entity26			0
you stand in that structure -- you look at the bedroom , to the left of the front door , and at the bed upon which @entity118 in 1913 gave birth to the child who would end up a president -- and you think of the long and tumultuous life that @entity19 would go on , from here , to lead			1
most of all -- and this is the inescapable thought as you stand within those four close walls -- you ponder a @entity37 before there was commercial airline travel , before there was television , and you picture the @entity132 , a continent and a universe away			0
it would seem : you ca n't get there from here			0
... the nature of raw ambition , and the rejection of impossibility , and the need to escape from what is to find out what will be			0
you stand in that nailed - together - from - a - kit house , and you try to imagine being a boy living there who has not yet learned what it is like to have strangers love you and strangers hate you , or even to have strangers know who you are			2
in the history of the @entity37 , of all the hundreds of millions of people who have lived and died , fewer than 50 have become president			0
where does it start ? " @entity161 was the center of our life in this house , " @entity19 once wrote			1
" before the days of television and radio , reading and conversation were our major indoor recreation			0
my first taste of politics came at the dinner table , which was in a corner of the living room			0
at dinner my father would engage us boys in lively conversations about the events of the day			0
i owe my early interests in debating to those dinners			0
even though i was young , my father believed that no one was too young to have an opinion and to learn how to express himself			0
" the family 's upright piano is in that living room -- @entity19 learned to play not only that , but the violin , the clarinet , the saxophone and the accordion			1
near the tiny kitchen with its cast - iron stove is a narrow flight of stairs			0
the house was not large enough to have a second story ; instead it had kind of a half - attic where all four boys , including the two who would die , @entity201 and @entity202 , slept in a single room			0
we 're all thinking about the presidency this year , as the country moves toward another @entity207			2
whatever your notions of @entity19 , however much you may feel that everything that can be said about him has been said , i think you will be fascinated and perhaps moved by your time in that mail - order house , should you ever have the opportunity to go			1
just to think , in the silence , about how things turn out the way they do			0
the @entity37 story can occasionally be utterly life - sized			2
from this spot to the @entity132 , to @entity219 , to @entity220 , to more than 56 countries , through all the political storms that still , even in death , rage around him			0
@entity226 and mrs. @entity118 are buried behind the house			0
a journey through life , a journey like no other , and in the end this is where they rest			2
you ca n't get there from here			0
but , of course , you can			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			1

@entity241 says @entity19 's love letters to wife @entity23 on display at @entity246
he says these , other exhibits raise more *quesions* about the controversial , enigmatic figure
he says boyhood home at the library is cramped ; yet @entity19 spoke of closeness with family
@entity241 : nixon library prompts *reflection* of how a life can go from there to the presidency
