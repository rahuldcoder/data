-- everyone is familiar with @entity2 , but humanity is only now meeting its much smaller @entity5 cousin			1
scientists have announced the discovery of a new genus and species of dinosaur , based on remains found in @entity12			1
they are calling the species @entity13			1
this dinosaur lived about 70 million years ago , say paleontologists @entity15 and @entity17 , at the @entity18 in @entity19			1
their study , published in the journal @entity23 , is aptly called " a @entity24 from the @entity25			0
" researchers discovered the dinosaur 's remains in 2006 in the @entity29 on @entity12 's @entity30			1
at the same quarry , @entity31 and @entity17 have previously uncovered other important finds , such as remnants of the horned dinosaur species @entity35 , whose discovery was announced in 2011			1
" i find it absolutely thrilling that there is another new dinosaur found in the polar region , " @entity15 said in a statement from the @entity18			2
" it tells us that the ecosystem of ancient @entity5 was a very different place , and it challenges everything we know about dinosaurs			0
" what scientists know about @entity13 comes from just a few fragments : the top part of a skull section , part of a lower jaw , and part of an upper facial jawbone			1
" @entity13 " loosely translates to " polar bear lizard , " according to the @entity18 , and honors the @entity61 people whose territory traditionally includes where the dinosaur remnants were found			1
the " hoglundi " part honors @entity19 entrepreneur and philanthropist @entity66			0
a @entity2 would have weighed between 7 and 8 tons , with a length of about 40 feet			2
by comparison , an adult @entity13 might have been only 25 feet long , with a weight of 1,000 pounds			2
the head was probably about 2 feet long , @entity0 affiliate @entity70 reported			0
" there were features in these specimens that were unique ; you did n't see them in other tyrannosaurs , " @entity17 told @entity70			0
study authors told the @entity18 that the dinosaur may have been so small because of how isolated the area was , and how little food was likely available			0
at that time , planet earth as a whole was warmer than it is today , but this particular area in @entity12 would have been dark about half the year			2
" conditions in this setting were relatively warm , but there were profound to extreme seasonal changes in light regime throughout the year that would have limited resource availability and produced substantial variance in temperatures , " study authors wrote			0
we know of other animals have clearly adapted to their environments by evolving in size over time , such as large @entity100 @entity5 mammoths that evolved to be cow - sized			0
but why was this particular dinosaur , @entity13 , living so far north on the globe ? scientists have many more such questions to explore			1
in terms of investigating this polar region for more clues , as @entity31 put it , this is just the tip of the iceberg			0
biggest predator ever to stalk @entity111 : 4 - inch teeth and 33 feet long			0

@entity13 is a newly discovered species
it lived on @entity12 's @entity30
the dinosaur was much smaller than its cousin , @entity2
