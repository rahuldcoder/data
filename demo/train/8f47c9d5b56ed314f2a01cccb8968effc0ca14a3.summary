-- as expected , " @entity1 : breaking @entity2 -- part 1 " led the box office once again over the extended @entity5 frame , but @entity10 's " the @entity9 " reboot more than held its own in second place			1
meanwhile , newcomers " @entity13 " and " @entity14 " started modestly , and " @entity15 , " " my week with @entity17 , " and " @entity18 " all impressed in limited release			1
here 's how the box office played out over the holiday weekend : " @entity1 : breaking @entity2 -- part 1 " ( geez , typing that whole title never gets any easier			1
i half - expect the next installment to be renamed " @entity27 " ) grossed $ 62.3 million over the wednesday - to - sunday period , with $ 42 million of that coming in over the regular three - day frame			1
that gives the vampire drama a ten - day total of $ 221.3 million , ahead of the $ 214.3 million " @entity33 " had earned at the same point in its run			1
other comparisons between " @entity33 " and " @entity35 " are hard to draw			0
" @entity33 " opened on a wednesday and was a summer movie , while " @entity35 " debuted on a friday and is playing during the @entity5 season			2
furthermore , both of their runs contained holiday weekends in the first two frames , which make weekend - to - weekend drops difficult to compare			0
for the record , though , " @entity35 's " three - day weekend drop was 70 percent from last week 's $ 138 million opening			1
one thing that can be said with certainty ? the " twilight " franchise remains a box office juggernaut			0
" @entity35 's " $ 10,330 per theater average was the second - highest in the @entity54 , and when all is said and done , it should finish its run in the $ 300 million range			1
@entity10 's $ 40 million reboot " the @entity9 " debuted in second place with a strong $ 42.3 million			1
the friendly felt puppets laughed up $ 29.5 million over the regular three - day weekend			1
audiences skewed slightly older than those at typical kids ' movies , as only 35 percent of viewers were under the age of 18 , but then the @entity9 were never meant to be solely kiddie fare â € ” that 's why " @entity67 " was invented ! " the @entity9 " $ 42.3 million bow is lower than the $ 49.1 million opening of the @entity71 's " @entity70 " ( which also starred @entity72 ) in 2007			1
thanks to strong word - of - mouth and terrific reviews , " @entity70 " endured through the holiday season and wound up with a magical $ 127 million total			1
with a straight " a " @entity78 grade and broad appeal with all ages , " the @entity9 " may climb to a similar $ 100 + million cume in the coming weeks			1
wherever " the @entity9 " finishes though , it has already proven more successful than the last @entity9 movies to hit theaters , " @entity84 , " which only earned $ 16.6 million in 1999			1
it looks like @entity86 might finally get the credit she 's always known she deserves			0
welcome back , guys ! after a disappointing opening last weekend , " @entity93 " needed a miraculous hold to save its box office prospects -- but that did n't really happen			0
the $ 135 million animated sequel earned another $ 18.4 million over five days and $ 13.4 million over three , which marks a rather large for a family film 37 percent drop			2
with $ 43.8 million after ten days , " @entity93 " wo n't come close to the original 's $ 198 million gross			2
penguins -- they 're just so 2006			0
two more expensive children 's movies rounded out the @entity102			0
in fourth , @entity105 's @entity104 - produced 3 - d animation " @entity13 " unwrapped a fairly lackluster $ 17 million in its first five days ( $ 12.7 million over three days )			1
the well - reviewed $ 98 million production scored an " a- - " cinemascore grade , and while its subject matter should help it hold well throughout december , " @entity113 " will need to post some very small declines to make up for its low $ 3,762 per theater average and maintain its location count			1
@entity115 's first foray into @entity116 , " @entity14 , " began its run in fifth place			0
the " adventure " ( read : homage to silent film ) cost producer @entity122 a reported $ 170 million , and @entity124 is distributing			2
" @entity14 " earned $ 15.4 million in five days , and $ 11.4 million over the typical weekend			2
while those results sound alarmingly low , the silver lining here is that " @entity14 " is only playing in 1,277 locations -- the smaller run yielded a strong $ 8,888 per theater average over three days			1
still , " @entity14 " has a lot to prove before anyone should consider calling it a success			0
@entity124 is clearly hoping to build a strong word - of - mouth foundation which could propel the well - reviewed film in the coming weeks , and a rep for the studio tells me that @entity124 plans to add a few hundred locations to its run next weekend before breaking into an extra-wide release on december 9 ( that is when @entity78 data will be available )			1
film buffs were apparently interested to see how @entity115 used the @entity116 illusion -- according to @entity124 , 75 percent of the film 's gross came from @entity116 screens			0
( according to me : a quick @entity151 browse reveals that today in @entity154 theaters , 64 out of 77 showtimes -- that 's 83 percent ! -- are in 3 - @entity155 would that mean that a 75 percent 3 - d share is actually disappointing ? ) in limited release , " @entity15 " proved utterly dominant			2
@entity160 's @entity159 drama , which is already earning a deafening amount of @entity163 buzz , expanded onto 433 screens on friday , and it increased 505 percent to $ 7.2 million over three days ( $ 9.2 million over five ) , giving " @entity15 " a tremendous $ 16,628 per theater average and a ten - day total of $ 10.7 million			1
@entity160 , more than any other arthouse studio , knows how to platform a release as audiences become engaged with the title , and @entity160 often holds back on expansion when prognosticators assume they 'll push their movies wider -- they did n't put @entity176 's last movie , " @entity177 , " into more than 1,000 theaters until its 15th weekend			0
we 'll have to wait and see what the distributor does with " @entity15 , " but they 've clearly got a hit on their hands			0
it should soar well past @entity159 's last picture , " @entity187 " ( $ 39.5 million ) and perhaps even past @entity159 's 2009 @entity163 bait , " @entity189 " ( $ 83 million )			2
fellow @entity163 contender " @entity17 " began its run with $ 2.1 million in five days			2
the @entity194 picture earned $ 311,000 out of 183 theaters on wednesday and thursday , and then expanded into 244 theaters for the weekend , when it earned $ 1.8 million more			1
that gave it a moderately good $ 6,161 per theater average			0
encouragingly , @entity17 ticked up by a strong 13 percent on saturday , and then dropped by a scant 30 percent on sunday , so word - of - mouth may be spreading quickly for the drama , which earned an " a- - " @entity78 grade			1
according to @entity204 , audiences were 65 percent female and 50 percent over the age of 50			0
in very limited debuts , " @entity18 " and " @entity210 " both posted strong numbers from just four theaters			0
@entity18 found about $ 210,000 and a stunning $ 52,604 per theater average -- great results for any film , much less a black - and - white silent one			1
with strong @entity163 buzz and an " a " cinemascore grade working in @entity18 's favor , @entity204 is planning to expand the film slowly through @entity219			0
@entity220 , meanwhile , grossed about $ 182,000 , for an impressive $ 45,463 venue average			2
expect expansions for the @entity226 / @entity225 / @entity224 film as well			0
one final note : interestingly , " @entity230 " seems to be enjoying a late surge of popularity			0
despite losing 468 theaters this weekend , the caper clicked up 3 percent to $ 7.3 million over three days			2
the $ 85 million ( $ 75 million after tax rebates ) @entity235 / @entity234 comedy , directed by @entity237 , has now found $ 65.3 million total			2
the @entity239 : breaking @entity2 -- part 1 -- $ 42 million ( $ 62.3 mil over five days ) 2			1
the @entity9 -- $ 29.5 mil ( $ 42 mil ) 3			1
@entity93 -- $ 13.4 mil ( $ 18.4 mil ) 4			2
@entity13 -- $ 12.7 mil ( $ 17 mil ) 5			1
@entity14 -- $ 11.4 mil ( $ 15.4 mil ) 6			0
@entity240 -- $ 10.3 mil ( $ 14.1 mil ) 7			0
