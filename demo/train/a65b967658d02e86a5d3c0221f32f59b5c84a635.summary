@entity0 -- the man claiming responsibility for last month 's deadly bombing at @entity0 's main international airport is the self - declared mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks and is described by the @entity8 government as " the leader of the @entity11 insurgency			1
" @entity12 , who says he ordered the airport blast that killed 36 people , is the head of the @entity16 , a @entity11 @entity18 jihadist group			1
in a video message posted on a website that regularly carries messages from @entity11 rebels , @entity12 said the message was recorded on january 24 -- the day of the suicide bombing at the airport			1
he wore camouflage combat fatigues and a black skullcap			0
" the special operation was done in accordance with my order			0
similar special operations will be taking place in the future , " he said in @entity31			0
in a separate message posted over the weekend , @entity12 vowed to deliver " a year of blood and tears " to @entity31 , saying that there were dozens of rebels prepared to carry out attacks			1
" i wo n't tell you there are hundreds of us prepared for jihad			1
but 50 or 60 , @entity45 willing , we will find , " said @entity12			1
" those operations will be conducted monthly or weekly , as @entity47 allows us , " he said			0
@entity12 himself once expressly opposed terrorism			1
now , he is designated by the @entity50 as a terrorist			0
" the emergence of @entity12 as the leader of the @entity11 insurgency intensified the split between national separatists and radical jihadists and led to a movement seeking to create an @entity60 of the @entity16 with @entity12 as the @entity61 , " the department website says			1
" @entity12 claimed responsibility for masterminding attacks in both @entity31 and the @entity64 , " including the 2009 @entity66 train derailment that killed 28 people and the 2010 @entity0 subway bombings , which killed 40 , the @entity50 says			1
in a statement in june 2010 , the department 's coordinator for counterterrorism , @entity72 , said @entity12 poses threats to the @entity8 and @entity31 and that his attacks " illustrate the global nature of the terrorist problem we face today			1
" the @entity79 , part of the @entity8 federal government , notes that the @entity16 cooperates with @entity82 and has declared jihad on the @entity8 , @entity31 , the @entity84 , and @entity85			1
in @entity0 , investigators say they have identified the suspected suicide bomber behind the airport attack as a 20 - year - old man from the @entity90			2
@entity91 , the head of @entity31 's @entity92 , has refused to publicly name the suspect or identify his specific origin			2
but he told @entity31 state television the alleged bomber was under the influence of drugs before the attack			0
" biological studies revealed the presence of a huge amount of highly potent narcotic and psychotropic substances in parts of the suicide bomber 's body , " @entity91 said			2
sitting beneath a black flag and flanked by two other bearded rebels in the message posted first , @entity12 named the young man to his left as " @entity112			1
" he said the man was being sent on a mission , although it is not clear from the video if this was the suspected @entity0 airport bomber , or when the message was recorded			0
" i would like @entity118 and @entity119 and all other kaffirs and enemies to understand that there are many of us who will follow in our footsteps and give their lives for @entity47 , " @entity12 said			2
@entity12 , thought to be 46 years old , is a seasoned fighter who has survived more than three years as the self - styled leader of the @entity16 despite a concerted campaign by @entity31 special forces to kill him			1
his video appearances reveal a stocky man with craggy features and a dense beard			0
@entity12 was born in southern @entity11 in 1964 , according to @entity11 websites , and describes his family as part of the " intelligentsia			1
" he came of age as the separatist campaign against @entity31 rule began to take root and joined the insurgency when @entity144 sent troops into the region in 1994			0
a peace deal reached with the @entity31 government briefly interrupted the @entity11 revolt , with leading separatists -- including @entity12 -- taking up positions in government			1
but it was a fragile truce and after a series of bomb attacks in @entity31 in 1999 , @entity0 sent its troops back into @entity11			2
@entity12 and others took up arms again			2
@entity31 's brutal military campaign began in 2000 , soon after @entity118 became president , and was widely criticized by human rights groups			0
in 2003 , @entity162 accused @entity31 forces of " committing hundreds of forced disappearances , extrajudicial executions , and widespread acts of torture and ill - treatment " in @entity11			1
@entity169 , a senior fellow at the @entity170 , said the @entity31 " had little concern for civilian casualties and used all kinds of weapons in the second war they had n't used previously			0
" it changed the nature and the goals of the @entity11 revolt			2
the @entity11 rebellion began morphing into a jihad to liberate the @entity183 lands of the @entity16			1
@entity11 is about 95 % @entity183			2
@entity169 said @entity0 had " effectively created the conditions for @entity18 terrorism while systematically eliminating those with whom it might have had a dialogue			0
" in 2005 , @entity12 gave a rare interview to @entity190			2
he had scars on his lips and chin and walked with a limp , apparently after stepping on a landmine			0
" everything they ( the @entity31 ) are doing in @entity11 is done to break the human spirit , to make people lose their humanity			2
and they are having considerable success with the horrific things they are doing to people , " he said			0
the @entity50 said that in 2005 , @entity11 security forces seized @entity12 's relatives " including his father , wife , and six month old son			1
they later released the wife and child , but the father 's location remained unknown			0
in august 2005 security forces also detained @entity12 's sister , @entity217			1
" in november 2007 , @entity12 declared himself the emir of the @entity16			1
in a proclamation published on a @entity11 jihadist website , he declared , " it was my destiny to lead the @entity222			1
... i will lead and organize @entity222 according to the understanding , given to me by @entity47			0
" he began to embrace terrorism and revived the @entity227 - @entity226 brigade for high - profile suicide missions			0
it had previously been involved in the siege of a school in @entity232 and the takeover of a @entity0 theater , both of which ended with heavy loss of life			0
@entity239 of the @entity240 at @entity241 said the @entity16 's targets have shown up @entity31 weaknesses			1
" these are really key transport infrastructure links that you would think would be under the highest protection possible , " he said			0
@entity12 's links with other jihadist groups , and in particular @entity82 , have been the subject of much speculation but little certainty			1
@entity11 have fought with @entity82 in @entity253 , and , along with other @entity183 from central @entity254 , are said to have joined forces with the @entity256 in northern @entity253			1
the @entity31 authorities say @entity82 operatives are involved in the @entity16			2
beyond spectacular attacks designed to bring terror to the @entity31 people , most analysts say the insurgents are unable to challenge the authority of the @entity31 state			0
" they 're too loosely organized , the sources of the grievances of many of the groups are too different , they are more locally based , " @entity239 said			0
but he sees no end to the instability in the northern @entity16			2
" it 's like a classic frontier zone , like the @entity274 ( the tribal areas ) in @entity276 , " he said			0
" it 's very difficult to govern , and it 's becoming more unstable , and that zone of instability is growing			0
" @entity1 's @entity281 and @entity282 contributed to this report			0
