-- in the span of a few days , more than 51,000 people have thrown their support behind a @entity5 trooper who was temporarily suspended for giving @entity7 magazine photos of the hunt and capture of one of the @entity7 bombing suspects			1
sgt. @entity12 , who was suspended for a day last week for releasing the photos without authorization , will face a closed hearing tuesday to determine his professional future with the agency , said state police spokesman @entity18			1
@entity7 magazine published what it said were @entity12 's images in a story last week			1
the piece quoted @entity12 as saying that he felt the @entity25 cover image -- showing a doe - eyed @entity26 with tousled hair -- was an insult to the victims of the april bombings			1
what do you think of the @entity25 cover ? @entity7 magazine said it received images that @entity12 , a tactical photographer , took of the hunt and capture of the alleged @entity7 bomber			1
" i hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real			0
it was as real as it gets , " @entity7 magazine quotes @entity12 as saying alongside numerous images , including one of the suspect appearing bloody , looking down , his shirt raised and what looks like a red dot laser trained on his forehead			1
" this guy is evil , " @entity12 told @entity7 magazine			1
" this is the real @entity7 bomber			1
not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of @entity25 magazine			2
" a day before three commissioned officers will decide if the sergeant will remain on full or restricted duty pending an investigation or suspended with or without pay during a probe , there was very little hair - splitting on " @entity61 " about how people feel			0
" if the powers that be do the right thing , they 'll give sgt. @entity12 a medal , a long weekend off with pay , a new camera , and an apology , " @entity63 posted on the @entity65 page			2

" but there were a few people who understood why the trooper was in trouble			0
@entity84 , a 16 - year - old from @entity86 posted , " i hate to see him lose his job , but what he did really was illegal ; those pictures were not his , since he took them for his employer			0
therefore , legally speaking , he stole the picture , and published it			0
i guess it depends how his contract was set up , but i think all copyrights would have been given over to the state ... " @entity84 reiterated his support for the trooper to @entity0 monday and said that he worried that the @entity25 cover might inspire someone to commit an act of terror hoping to land on the cover of a legendary magazine			1
on monday @entity0 reached a woman who said she was the organizer of the page but would only give a first name -- @entity108			0
she said that she felt compelled to create the page because her own father was a @entity5 trooper			2
" i thought this page would only be popular among my friends , but i 'm getting private messages from people across the country , in @entity114 and in @entity115 , all over , who believe this trooper did the right thing , " she said			0
" i was so angry when i heard that sgt. @entity12 was going to suffer for trying to stand up for victims			2
" fast facts : @entity122 before quoting @entity12 in several long passages , @entity7 magazine wrote : " here , in his own words , @entity12 shares his thoughts on the @entity25 cover			1
he stresses that he is speaking strictly for himself and not as a representative of the @entity5			2
" @entity130 , @entity7 magazine 's editor in chief , said the magazine has hundreds of photos similar to the ones @entity12 provided and will publish more in its september issue			1
he said @entity12 was " conflicted on some level " about releasing the photos , but " genuinely worried " about how the @entity25 cover will affect the victims ' families			1
the @entity25 cover unleashed a wave of intense reaction on social media , which played out in brick - and - mortar stores			2

@entity25 issued a statement saying that the story " falls within the traditions of journalism and @entity25 's long - standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage ... " " the fact that @entity26 is young , and in the same age group as many of our readers , " the statement read , " makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens			2
