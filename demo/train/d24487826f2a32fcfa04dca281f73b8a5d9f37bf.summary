-- you are only a short putt away from a major championship and golfing immortality			2
you can already taste the acclaim , hear the roars from the gallery crowded round the 18th green and smell the bundles of cash heading your way			0
but then an image of @entity13 slumped over his driver at @entity15 in 2011 flashes through your mind , @entity18 sinking to the turf at the @entity20 a year later after throwing away a four - shot lead			1
before you know it , you 're having dark visions of @entity25 wading through the @entity26 at @entity27 during his own @entity29 @entity20 meltdown in 1999			2
suddenly that putt looks a lot longer than it did a moment ago and you start wondering , " what if i miss ? " you may also start questioning why you did n't pay a pre-tournament visit to golf 's premier mind doctor , whose job it is to instil a watertight frame of mind that can deal with a career - defining putt			1
" players will tell you , you can get teary - eyed thinking what this could mean to your mum and dad , your wife , your children , for your name in history , " dr. @entity42 told @entity0 ahead of this week 's @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45			1
it is the final major of the golf season -- where @entity13 will defend his title , and world no. 1 @entity58 will seek to end a five - year wait for the 15th of his career			1
" you could start adding up how many dollars you 're going to make			2
it is like , ' can we just take care of this putt right now ? ' you need the ability to get lost in the present where nothing else in the moment exists , " @entity42 added			1
" this putt is something you 've done a million times both in your mind and on the practice putting green and on the golf course			1
" now you 've got to let yourself do it in this important situation but in order to do it you better not be reminding yourself how big this is or important this is			0
" most guys are trying to treat it like just another putt			0
but it 's difficult because your hands are shaking a bit , your arms are shaking a bit , your heart is beating like crazy , you ca n't get any moisture in your mouth			2
" golf is a cruel and unforgiving pursuit in which the word " choke " seems to reappear more than any other			0
often , a major meltdown can be more memorable than the eventual winner			0
just ask @entity13 about @entity15 , veteran @entity99 about losing a playoff at the @entity20 in 2009 or consult @entity101 on his capitulation to let @entity103 win the @entity104			1
interactive : what do major winners earn ? that knowledge surely only adds fuel to the fire when a player is in a trough that must feel like it is squeezing the life out of his game			1
though there is a caddy by your side , only one person can extricate you from this mess			0
no wonder then that training the brain has become as pivotal a part of a modern player 's preparation as the hours spent honing their swing on the range			1
@entity42 has worked with some of the game 's biggest stars , major champions like @entity13 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 , who are all keen to tap into his well of knowledge			1
with a myriad of professionals capable of winning major honors and the intensity of competition rising all the time , players are increasingly obsessed with squeezing every last drop out of their potential			2
even the very best players are n't impervious to pressure , so @entity42 's work acts to soothe increasingly frazzled brains so they can plot a path to glory			1
what , then , does he tell players about that moment , when one shot can make or break their careers ? " we 're trying to get to the best state of mind and trying to catch it if we get half an inch away from that instead of waiting to get in a deep dark hole and having to dig yourself out , " he said			2
" we 're talking about believing you 're the best golfer in the world in a world that has a lot of really , good , talented and committed golfers			0
" everyone was n't brought up thinking that way ; a lot of people find it easy to respect other people or to believe in somebody else winning			0
" players have to learn as they develop skill that now you 've developed this skill now you have to fall in love with your talent and your potential and ability if you 're going to be the best golfer in the world			2
" it is no surprise many of @entity42 's subjects have held it together right at the moment they needed to most			1
@entity133 won the first major he played in -- the 2011 @entity189 pga championship -- surviving a nerve - jangling playoff against @entity191			1
he credited the work he did with @entity42 in helping him to stay focused after a triple - bogey on the 15th hole in his final round looked to have ripped his dream to shreds			1
after his triumph , @entity133 said he actually felt energized after his mistake , such was the positive frame of mind @entity42 had helped him download			1
at the other end of the spectrum , @entity134 was playing in his 46th major championship when he hit the front at the 2011 @entity20			0
one of a rare crop to win his first major title over the age of 40 , @entity134 had @entity42 on hand all week to keep him cool in the heat of battle at @entity214 on the southern coast of @entity216			1
but not before @entity42 had to iron out a major putting wobble before the tournament even began			1
" we spent a lot of time together during his @entity20 win , " @entity42 said			2
" in @entity134 's case it started wednesday and he was totally lost with his putter			0
" he said to me , ' if we can get my head in the right place with my putter i think it 'll take all the pressure off my ball striking and pitching and bunker play and i 'll be fine			0
' " over the next few days we got his head where he wanted to with the putter , and magic happened			0
he started doing some great stuff and the ball started going in the hole and he won			0
" i think the last step for @entity134 was to let himself go out on sunday -- the phrase we kept saying was , ' you 're unstoppable if you 're unflappable			1
' " i kept telling @entity134 you 've got to be unflappable , you ca n't let a good shot that takes a bad bounce bother you or get you down or frustrated			0
you 've got to stay in a good mood			0
" for @entity134 , he had to be himself			0
when i think of @entity134 i think of really good - natured , happy guy			0
i said to him do n't have the only place you 're not happy be on a golf course			2
" happy might not be a word most closely associated with the leader of the @entity43 if he has a one - shot lead to protect down the final hole on sunday but if he 's spoken to @entity257 , at least he 'll be in the zone .			0

work on mental preparation has become a vital part of golf in recent times
dr. @entity42 has coached some of the game 's biggest stars
@entity42 's mantra to his players is " you 're unstoppable if you 're unflappable "
he has worked with major champions @entity13 and @entity133
