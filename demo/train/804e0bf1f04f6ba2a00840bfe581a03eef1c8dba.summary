-- as it measures its response to the recent events on @entity4 , the @entity1 needs to be extremely careful about focusing on the definition of " coup " and the legitimacy -- or non-legitimacy -- of @entity10 's election , the draft constitution , and the now - ousted @entity4 president 's efforts to give himself additional powers			1
it needs to be equally careful about focusing on the protests that helped drive him from power , and the legitimacy of political @entity20			0
if the @entity1 focuses on whether or not a coup took place , it will be ignoring the fact that @entity4 is a key center of the @entity26 and that @entity1 policy will be judged by its success in meeting the needs of @entity4 's people			1
@entity4 is a nation whose problems go far deeper than the crisis that began january 2011			1
as the @entity36 human development report made clear in 2009 , former president @entity35 's rule had become steadily more ineffective , corrupt , and incapable of meeting the needs of @entity4 's people long before 2011			1
he had been in power since october 1981 , but the social and economic progress he made in his first decade in power had faded into a static , incompetent regime by 2005 , and one that became steadily more corrupt and unable to meet the needs of @entity4 's young and growing population			1
the last two years have made the situation far worse in ways that affect every aspect of day - to - day life			0
@entity35 's fall tore down a fragile regime that mixed a state - driven economy with crony capitalism			2
it was a country with a bureaucracy that could barely function without a strong leader , one with no opposition parties that had real political experience or capability to govern , and whose " reformers " were ( and still are ) protesters with no capability to make real reforms			0
opinion : in @entity4 , get ready for extremist backlash the end result is that @entity4 is not an abstract exercise in political theory			2
it is a nation of more than 85 million people , at least 25 % of whom live in dire poverty , and where unemployment and underemployment can no longer be accurately estimated but have reached the crisis level			2
it is a nation with over 50 % of its population under 25 years of age , and 31 % under 14 , but with an education system in breakdown and much of the infrastructure frozen or losing capacity			2
@entity4 's foreign reserves have dropped by more than 50 % and it faces a crisis in getting loans from the @entity85			1
it is a nation where foreign investment has critically declined , tourist revenue has dropped sharply , where many small businesses have already collapsed , and many middle class @entity4 have lost their jobs and savings			2
fuel and electric power are lacking , food subsidies are uncertain and sometimes failing , the currency is increasingly unstable , and crime has skyrocketed			0
@entity1 policy must focus on these realities , and not just politics			2
the @entity1 , in partnership with its allies , the @entity101 and other international aid agencies institutions needs to support immediate @entity4 efforts to salvage the economy and bring economic reform			1
it needs to focus on bringing relief and stability			0
no @entity4 government can succeed -- democratic or not -- that can not meet the needs of the @entity4 people			0
real political legitimacy is not determined by how a government is chosen , but by how well it can meet the needs of its people			0
opinion : will @entity4 's @entity117 survive ? as for politics , the @entity1 needs to work with other states to push @entity4 's military to support the reforms that failed between early 2011 and @entity10 's fall			1
this means a broad - based effort to agree on a constitution , the creation of real political parties , and help for protesters learning how to organize politically and focus on practical governance and reform			0
it means taking enough time for elections to be open , to include @entity20 and more secular parties , and focusing on the same kind of mixed national government and consensus politics that seem to have emerged in @entity138			0
one test of a solution to a problem is that it does not make things even worse			0
threatening @entity4 's military , rigidly cutting off aid because of a " coup " under conditions where there is no credible replacement government , and standing aside as @entity4 drifts towards internal collapse is not a strategy			1
letting today 's celebration of @entity10 's fall turn into civil conflict and political paralysis will be a moral and ethical failure on the part of the @entity157 administration and the @entity158 , one that will do the @entity4 people vast harm , cripple a key ally , and leave a legacy of lasting anger in both @entity4 and the region			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			0

@entity169 : @entity1 must focus not on *details* of @entity173 ouster but on @entity4 's *ongoing* crisis
he says @entity35 corrupt , ineffective , but in past 2 years , nation in economic collapse
he says @entity1 most focus on reality , work with @entity101 , allies to raid @entity4 economy
*writer* : threatening aid cutoff while nation in flux could do vast harm , cripple a key regional ally
