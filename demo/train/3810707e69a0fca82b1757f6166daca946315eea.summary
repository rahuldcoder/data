-- @entity1 and his partner , @entity2 , celebrated their 30th anniversary by getting married			1
the two met when they were both serving in the @entity6 , and last week , the military veterans became the first same - sex couple to be legally married by a tribe in @entity10			1
the pair exchanged vows on a cold but sunny morning at the government headquarters of the @entity14			0
@entity2 is a citizen of the @entity15 , a federally recognized @entity16 tribe			1
earlier this month , the @entity15 tribal council voted to recognize same - sex unions as long as at least one member of the couple was a citizen of the tribe			1
@entity2 and @entity1 were married the same morning that the tribal chairman signed the legislation into law			1
" @entity1 had a heart attack last year , so we 're aware that we need to do this now			2
we have less years in front of us than we do behind us , " said @entity2			2
" plus i just want to marry him			0
i love him , " he added			0
the couple lives in @entity33 , @entity10 , on a 30 - acre farm that has been in @entity2 's family for generations			1
" we did n't want to go to another state to get married			0
we always wanted to have the wedding here in the state of @entity10			2
it 's our home , " @entity2 said			2
the state of @entity10 , however , says it will not recognize their marriage			1
" the @entity44 defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman			0
same - sex marriages performed in other states , countries , or in sovereign tribal nations are not valid in the state of @entity10 , " said @entity49 , spokeswoman for @entity10 attorney general @entity50			1
under @entity57 policy , native american tribes like the @entity15 are self - governing and therefore able to make and enforce their own laws -- including ones governing marriage of tribal citizens			2
in 2004 , @entity10 approved a constitutional amendment legally defining marriage as being between a man and a woman			2
thirty - seven other states have laws or amendments similarly defining marriage , according to the @entity70			2
@entity1 and @entity2 say they are optimistic the tide is shifting in favor of same - sex marriage			1
" marriage was inconceivable for me for such a long time , but now that has changed , " @entity1 said			2
last year , for the first time , voters in several states approved same - sex marriage statewide at the ballot box			1
similar measures had been rejected for years			0
same - sex couples became free to marry in @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			1
gay rights supporters also scored a smaller victory in @entity88 , where voters rejected a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage			0
before 2012 , six states had already legalized gay marriage -- but via courts and legislatures , not voters			0
more americans favor same - sex marriage than oppose it , according to a recent @entity99 poll			1
the @entity15 is the third tribe to recognize same - sex marriages , after the @entity102 of @entity103 and the @entity104 of @entity85			1
getting married is not the end of the journey for @entity2 and @entity1			1
they would like their marriage and those of other gays and lesbians to be legally accepted in every state			0
the biggest hurdle the couple faces is the federal @entity115 , known as @entity115			0
the 1996 law allows states to ignore the marriage laws of other states and it specifically exempts states from being forced to accept tribal same - sex marriages			1
the @entity122 is expected to rule on a legal challenge to @entity115 this term			0
photos : the art of same - sex weddings @entity1 and @entity2 hope their union will be part of the ongoing legal and personal discussions about marriage rights for gays and lesbians			1
@entity1 asks people to keep an open mind			0
" we served our country to uphold those people 's rights to protest our right to get married , " he said			0
" if you 're good enough to bear arms for your country or to die in some lonely valley in @entity146 , you 're good enough to come home and get married			0
" @entity1 and @entity2 said they are thrilled to finally be able to express their love in marriage , and they are mindful that their simple ceremony could hold meaning for other gays and lesbians			1
" after waiting 30 years , we had patience and it finally happened			0
and you want to help people who are also in that struggle , " @entity2 said			0
