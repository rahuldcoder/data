" three of the names include the claim that the men were found " responsible " for sexual assaults by the university			0
a fourth name is identified as a " serial rapist			0
" in a statement , an independent , student - run online news site said it demanded that a staff member named on the list " permanently and immediately resign from their position			1

it 's not known who is behind the campaign , which has generated both support and outrage around campus			1

" it 's not like this was a fun thing to do for whoever wrote it , i 'm sure , " @entity6 sophomore @entity49 , who said she 's a sexual assault survivor , told @entity1 affiliate @entity51			1
normally , @entity1 does not name sexual assault victims but did in this case after @entity59 's on - camera interview			0
" honestly , it was a last resort , just out of desperation			0
" earlier this month , 23 students filed a federal complaint against @entity6 , alleging the school failed to protect victims of sexual assault , according to a statement from the students			1

in a statement , the university declined to comment on the allegations but said it had taken " a series of significant new measures dedicated to preventing such sexual misconduct			0

" the student , a senior at @entity6 , asked that her name not be used			1
@entity119 , a graduate student in creative writing , said he understood the rationale for the list			2

" @entity131 , another @entity6 graduate student in creative writing , said the list includes some " big names " on campus			1
" i do n't think it 's anybody 's right to put information in the world that has n't been proven , " said @entity131 , who asked that her last name not be used			0

@entity147 , none of the four names on the fliers appear in a 2014 database as being involved in any criminal activity			0
@entity6 declined to comment directly on the fliers but issued a general statement : " to avoid chilling complainants from coming forward and to respect all parties involved , the @entity6 does not comment on the particulars of disciplinary proceedings regarding sexual misconduct			2
in addition , the @entity6 is mindful of the multiple federal laws that govern these matters and provide important protections to survivors of sexual violence and to students engaged in our investigative process			1
these laws and our constitutional values do not permit us to silence debate on the difficult issues being discussed			0
" the author of the fliers added a line at the bottom saying , " to the @entity178 : stay safe , protect and support each other and always , always , make sure to have sober , enthusiastic , continuous consent			2
