well , it seems the @entity1 finally got the memo : do n't use all @entity3 ! it 's rude ! the @entity1 is switching to a new messaging system that 's cheaper and more efficient			1
and oh yeah , one that does away with a century - old practice : communications using all uppercase letters			2
" lowercase messages are here to stay ; they provide a more readable format , " a @entity1 news release said , citing @entity12 , the naval messaging program manager at @entity14			1
the all - caps were a vestige of a bygone era			1
back in the 1850s , the teletype machines that the military used were made up of three rows of keys -- none of them lowercase letters			2
word of the change went out to all naval commands in april			2
but it did n't reach the rest of us until the news release this week			0
in it , the @entity1 said it is ditching its in - house @entity35 in favor of e-mail			1
one with a very apt acronym : @entity40 ( @entity41 )			0
the switch will save the @entity1 $ 20 million a year			1
and it gets them caught up with current internet protocol			1
all @entity3 reads like you 're being shouted at			0
old sea dogs may feel differently			0
but they have a couple of months to adjust			0
the system wo n't fully be in place until next year			2
once it is , naval officers will no longer feel like they 're being barked at			0
except , of course , in person by their superiors .			0

the move will save the @entity1 more than $ 20 million a year
using all caps is like shouting in current internet protocol
the @entity1 has been using all caps since the 1850s
