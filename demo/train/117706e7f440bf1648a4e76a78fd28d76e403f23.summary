@entity0 -- @entity2 was eight years old when she was promised in marriage to a man she had never met			1
when , six years later , her mother showed @entity8 a photograph of her intended husband , the 14 - year - old reacted with horror			1
the pressure on the youngster mounted as @entity2 's @entity15 - born mother tried to involve her in the wedding arrangements			1
when she refused to marry the man , saying she wanted to finish her education in her hometown of @entity21 , in the @entity22 , her family held her prisoner in her bedroom until she relented , she said			1
" in the end i said yes , but started to plan my escape , " @entity8 , one of seven sisters , recalled			1
her parents released her , and she promptly ran away from home			1
she was just 15 years old			2
" my mother told me i could n't come back until i agreed ( to the marriage ) or i was dead in their eyes			2
my family disowned me to this day			1
" i 'd shamed them and dishonored them			1
i do n't talk to any of them any more			0
it 's been 29 years since then			0
" when @entity2 left , her younger sister had to marry the man to whom she had been promised			1
" that was the only way [ my parents ] had to save honor , in their eyes , " she told @entity1			1
her parents , who have subsequently died , also forced her other sisters to enter into arranged marriages , she said			1
" as a young person growing up in @entity50 , going to their houses , you 'd see horrific stories of them being beaten and abused , " she said			2
" yet my mother 's response was to tell them to stay there because it was their duty to make the marriage work for the sake of our honor			1
" @entity2 wept as she recalled the fate of one of her sisters , whom she said was beaten by her husband			1
" she went to my family , for help			0
but at the age of 24 she set herself on fire and committed suicide			1
@entity1 's attempts to locate the husband to seek comment have been unsuccessful			0
" her death was a time for me where i recognized just how important honor is to a family			2
" @entity2 added that for her parents , " losing a daughter in such a horrific way " had dishonored them			1
@entity8 now uses her experience to campaign in @entity50 schools against arranged marriages and so - called " honor " crimes , and has set up a network for victims , called @entity90			1
the charity , which is partly funded by the @entity50 government , takes 500 calls a month from both men and women who have concerns			0
@entity2 described the different kinds of people who ring : " typical calls include a teacher having to deal with an eight - year - old girl saying i 'm going to @entity103 to get married			1
our call handlers are trained to handle this			0
" many professionals are trained to be culturally sensitive in @entity50 , but this means we have to help them overcome their fears of being called a racist , because that is what perpetrators will use to get them to turn a blind eye			0
" the issue of killing people to preserve a family 's honor was brought to wider attention earlier this year when three members of a family of @entity123 immigrants were convicted in @entity124 for the killing of four relatives			2
the defendants were sentenced to life in prison			0
two of them admitted during their trial they were angry about the victims ' western attitudes			0
experts say the case has lifted the lid on just how common so - called " honor " murders are around the world , and in places some would not suspect			2
" it 's definitely a problem that happens in many different places : the @entity149 , @entity103 , @entity150 and among immigrant communities in @entity152 , " said @entity142 , a researcher on women 's rights in the @entity145 world for @entity146			2
several @entity145 countries and territories , including @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and the @entity160 territories , have laws providing lesser sentences for so - called " honor " murders than for other murders , @entity146 says			2
@entity167 and @entity168 also have laws that have been interpreted to allow reduced sentences for " honor " crimes , the group says			0
reliable figures of the number of honor murders are hard to come by , @entity142 said , but she pointed to a @entity177 estimate of 5,000 per year			0
the triggers for an " honor " crime can be varied			1
" it can be anything that you take for granted , such as being a normal adolescent teenager or being a bit rebellious , " @entity2 said			2
" that can be having your nose pierced , dyeing your hair pink , having a mobile phone , going on social networks -- these are the things that can be perceived as being dishonorable to a family that operates an " honor " system			0
" they are the things that can put a victim at risk of a forced marriage , ' honor abuse ' or even murder			2
i 've seen cases where girls have been murdered for passing their driving test , having aspirations after school , for being seen kissing a boy at a tube station , asking for divorce			0
" experts say the practice should not be blamed on @entity215			0
" it 's not linked to religion ; it 's more cultural , " said @entity142			0
" there have been several @entity215 scholars who have issued fatwas against ' honor killing			0
' " @entity215 does n't justify ' honor murders , ' experts insist @entity2 agreed , but said @entity225 communities in @entity50 needed to do more			1
" no religion , be it @entity215 or @entity228 supports this			0
in fact they support what i 'm saying , but those religious leaders do n't say that			0
" i 'm not trying to embarrass those communities , but they should be ashamed because it is happening and they 're not taking a stand			0
" @entity1 's @entity239 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 ran away from home aged 15 to escape arranged marriage
she said her parents disowned her to this day because she 'd " shamed and dishonored them "
her sister committed suicide rather than marry man to whom she was promised
@entity8 : triggers can be *trivial* or serious ; religious communities doing little to tackle honor crime
