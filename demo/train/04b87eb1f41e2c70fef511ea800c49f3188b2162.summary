in both cases , cars were loaded with large amounts of explosive material , according to @entity57			1
there was a third explosion of a diesel fuel tank elsewhere in @entity52 , but @entity57 said this was ruled an accident			2

the blast drew swift condemnation internationally , including from @entity117 secretary of state @entity116 , who vowed that @entity120 will " stand with our ally , @entity3			2
" the report came shortly after the @entity122 for @entity10 , an opposition group , reported that @entity10 government forces had fired several shells toward @entity52 , which is in @entity3 's southern province of @entity127			1
several @entity10 were among the casualties , according to the @entity129 , another opposition group			1

" around ( 20,000 ) to 25,000 @entity10 live here in camps as our guests			2
certain steps as in @entity52 today may be taken to affect the sensitivity in @entity127 by those not willing to accept the status quo			0
" @entity3 hosts more than 190,000 @entity10 refugees in state - run camps , and more @entity10 who have fled their country to @entity3 cities and towns			1
in addition , @entity3 has played a major role in providing assistance and a relatively safe springboard for operations to @entity10 opposition groups			1

no power would be successful in hurting @entity3 's tranquility			2
" in a statement , the opposition @entity185 condemned the attacks			0
" the @entity185 sees these heinous terrorist acts as an attempt to take revenge on the @entity3 people and punish them for their honorable support for the @entity10 people , including their welcoming of @entity10 refugees who have fled the regime 's crimes in their villages and cities , " it said			1
" the @entity185 views this attack as a desperate and failed attempt to sow discord between the two peoples			0
" the conflict in @entity10 has repeatedly spilled across borders to @entity3 , prompting @entity3 security forces to reinforce the frontier			1
