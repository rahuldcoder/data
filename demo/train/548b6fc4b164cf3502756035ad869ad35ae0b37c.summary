-- if you did n't already know , @entity1 is a bigger deal in the @entity4 than in @entity5			1
here , this unofficial holiday is almost as popular as , oh , @entity7 -- which means it 's unfortunately become a drinking holiday			1
so much so that it 's been nicknamed , @entity1 and even @entity10			2
actually today commemorates @entity5 's victory against the @entity13 during the @entity14 in 1862 , and according to research by @entity19 professor @entity18 - @entity17 , it is n't a @entity5 holiday at all but rather an @entity4 one created by @entity22 in @entity23 during the @entity24			1
in a perfect world , folks would use today as an opportunity to learn more about @entity5 history and culture , but the sea of margarita and nacho specials might be too distracting for some			2
so , in the spirit of not completely raining on everyone 's parade , we 've compiled a list of @entity39 to avoid so as not to offend others and / or embarrass yourself today			0
' @entity42 ! ' ... said no @entity5 ever today is not @entity5 's independence day ( which is september 16 ) so you should refrain from treating it as such			1
you will rarely see a @entity5 in the @entity4 or in @entity5 -- outside of where the battle actually happened -- acknowledge , let alone celebrate , the holiday			1
resist the urge to wear sombreros and fake mustaches because , well , stereotypes while it may seem like all fun and games , these costumes essentially reduce cultural and traditional costumes to a caricature			0
take it from the @entity61 sorority sisters who learned the hard way after donning ponchos during one of their " @entity5 - themed " parties			2
( not to mention the offensive signs they made to accompany their costumes			0
enjoy traditional @entity5 libations , but do n't use @entity1 as an excuse to get brutally inebriated there 's a thin line between enjoying a drink special with friends and running amok after taking 13 shots of tequila			1
plus , blacking out drunk is sort of disrespectful given @entity1 is in remembrance of a battle , meaning lives were lost			0
in other words , keep it classy , folks			0
avoid using your high school level @entity86 with native @entity86 speakers today any attempts to awkwardly " connect " will likely come off as cheesy and empty			0
and , please do n't ask anyone to " speak @entity86 " for your amusement because that 's just disrespectful			0
plus , not all @entity22 speak @entity86 so you may be striking another nerve			0
do n't plan a trip to @entity5 to celebrate a ' real ' @entity1 outside of the state of @entity96 in @entity5 , the holiday is n't really celebrated at all			1
even the celebrations in @entity96 are much more tempered and family oriented			0
if you 're genuinely interested in @entity5 , head to @entity101 , @entity102 or even @entity103 on september 16 and indulge in an authentic experience in all things @entity5			1
