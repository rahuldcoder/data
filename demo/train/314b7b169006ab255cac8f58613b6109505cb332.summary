@entity0 -- relations between once strategic allies @entity4 and @entity5 continued to deteriorate monday as both countries exchanged allegations that their nationals were targeted for intrusive and overly extreme security screening at each other 's main international airports			1
some 40 @entity4 who landed in @entity0 's @entity13 airport monday morning were individually questioned by @entity5 authorities according to @entity4 @entity16 spokeswoman @entity15			1
she said it was the first time such an incident had occurred with @entity4 nationals flying into @entity5			1
another @entity16 official , @entity20 told @entity1 that @entity4 was still looking into the incident and seeking clarification as to who gave the instructions for the @entity4 passengers to undergo enhanced screening			2
speaking to @entity4 news portal @entity28 one of the detained @entity4 passengers said they were asked a series of questions about their travel and instructed to open their bags and show the contents of their computers			2
" they apparently got an order to detain us , one by one			0
everyone was in shock ; we did n't know what they were going to do to us			0
obviously this was done intentionally in order to create an unpleasant feeling " one of the unidentified passengers told @entity28			0
another passenger described @entity5 authorities specifically identifying @entity4 for screening : " as soon as they saw an @entity4 , they told him to move on to questioning			1
all the @entity4 were together and they accumulated the passports in one file ... i have never seen them behaving in such disrespect			2
" a @entity61 official , speaking on condition of anonymity following diplomatic protocol , would not respond directly to the charges that @entity4 passengers were specifically targeted for increased scrutiny , but he pointed out that @entity5 passengers leaving @entity4 were subjected to more intense screening the day before in @entity70 's international airport			1
" @entity5 passengers on the @entity74 flight from @entity70 were searched in an unusual manner ... and complaints were filed , " the @entity5 official told @entity1			1
" on the return of the flight to @entity0 it seems @entity5 police have just kept and delayed some passengers for passport control , no questioning , " he added			1
" they were scrutinized in a different matter i guess			0
in a different manner than the usual , " the @entity5 official told @entity1 , but he denied that there was some kind of " tit - for - tat " treatment of passengers taking place			2
in report published monday in the semi-official @entity95 members of a group of @entity5 tourists claimed they were forced to undergo additional security screening at @entity4 's @entity99 on sunday as they were preparing to leave @entity4			1
one male @entity5 passenger identified by the last name " @entity103 " described being asked a series of detailed personal questions followed by a forced strip search in a special security room			2
" they forced me to undo my trousers			0
while i was getting out angrily , i saw that they were taking some @entity5 women in these rooms the same way			2
this made us even more upset			0
they only did this to the @entity5			2
they only took @entity5 to the special rooms , " @entity103 told @entity95			0
@entity120 , the guide for a @entity5 tourist group told @entity1 @entity4 airport security singled out @entity5 passengers shortly after they checked in their bags at @entity127 airport			1
" it was mostly psychological			0
their search was very detailed right down to a pack of tissues			0
they were taking out even dirty clothes as they opened suitcases , " @entity120 said			0
" they took us in special rooms for a body search ... the situation lasted at least three hours			0
it was as if they received an order to delay the process , to bother the people			0
" @entity20 could not comment on the allegations telling @entity1 that other than media reports @entity4 had received no official complaint from either the @entity5 government or @entity5 citizens			1
complaints about excessive security screening and profiling at @entity4 's @entity127 airport are common and have lead to a number of high profile controversies involving foreigners and @entity159 travelling in and out of @entity4			0
the respective airport incidents come on the heels of @entity163 's announcement friday , that it would expel the @entity4 ambassador and other high - ranking diplomats stationed in @entity5 within a matter of days			1
@entity5 downgraded relations following @entity4 's refusal to apologize for the killing of eight @entity5 and one @entity171 during an @entity4 assault on the @entity5 flagged ship @entity173 in 2010			1
the ship had sailed for @entity175 carrying supplies and @entity177 activists seeking to break the @entity4 maritime blockade of @entity175			0
the blockade was imposed , according to the @entity4 military , to prevent the smuggling of weapons to the @entity184 - ruled coastal enclave			0
a @entity186 investigation into the violent maritime event found that the @entity4 blockade of @entity175 was a " legitimate security measure " in compliance with international law , but it said that @entity4 had used " excessive and unreasonable " force in the takeover of the ship			0
@entity4 insists that its soldiers acted in self - defence after being assaulted by the @entity5 activists			1
@entity0 is a popular transit hub for many @entity4 traveling to and from @entity4			1
@entity74 flies daily flights between @entity0 's @entity13 and @entity4 's @entity99 in @entity70			1
@entity1 's @entity199 and @entity200 reported from @entity4 ; @entity1 's @entity201 and @entity202 reported from @entity5 .			2
