-- @entity1 , who became the national face of the foreclosure crisis last fall when she shot herself during an eviction , was a quiet woman who never asked for help			1
@entity6 , 91 , who was a deaconess at her church , was remembered by friends and churchgoers for her stateliness			1
@entity12 foreclosed on the @entity14 , @entity15 , home of @entity1 , 91 , after acquiring the mortgage in 2007			1
" she had runner 's legs , " said @entity17 , a longtime family friend of @entity6 's and fellow member of @entity19			1
" they were well - shaped , well - shaped calves , and she still wore her heels and did n't stumble , " @entity17 said			2
" i used to ask her , ' did you used to run ? ' she 'd say ' i would run from trouble , that 's about it , ' " @entity17 said			2
" we always laughed at that			0
" but @entity6 did n't run from the troubling eviction notices that were placed time and time again on her door in @entity14 , @entity15			1
she kept her business to herself			0
" she was n't a really vocal person , " @entity17 said			0
" she 'd communicate , but you never knew what was going on			0
if it was anything negative you did n't know ; if it was positive you did n't know			0
she was just quiet about her personal life			2
" @entity6 , made news last fall when she shot herself during an eviction , died monday at the @entity50 at @entity52 nursing home near @entity14			1
the @entity54 's office , when contacted tuesday by @entity0 , said the cause of death has not been released but it was not related to the shooting			0
after @entity6 's ordeal last october sparked national outrage , @entity12 moved to halt the foreclosure process and " give her the house , " company spokesman @entity59 said at the time			1
" we 're going to forgive whatever outstanding balance she had on the loan , " @entity65 said			0
" given the circumstances , we think it 's appropriate			0
" in 2004 , @entity6 took out a 30 - year , 6.375 percent mortgage for $ 45,620 with a @entity74 office in @entity75 , @entity15			1
the same day , she also took out an $ 11,380 line of credit			0
over the next couple of years , @entity6 missed payments on the 101 - year - old home that she and her late husband purchased in 1970			1
in 2007 , the mortgage was in the hands of @entity12 , which soon filed for foreclosure			2
@entity14 sheriff 's deputy @entity87 , in a telephone interview with @entity0 on tuesday , said he 'd personally been to @entity6 's door about six times to deliver eviction notices			1
" never did reach her , but always left notes , " @entity87 said			0
as part of the eviction process , authorities left writs of possession -- legal terms that informed the occupier of eviction -- on the front door of homes			0
@entity87 said each time he 'd return the notes would be gone , and he 'd leave another			0
@entity6 's two self - inflicted gunshots to the chest were heard around the @entity106 as the lifelong homemaker became a symbol for struggling @entity106 homeowners burdened down by debt and unrelenting mortgage companies			1
news of @entity6 's plight was so pervasive that @entity106 rep. @entity114 , @entity115 , evoked her name on the @entity119 floor during debate over the @entity122 bailout just days after the shooting			1
" this bill does nothing for the @entity126 of the world , " @entity114 said			2
" this bill fails to address the fact that millions of homeowners are facing foreclosure , are facing the loss of their home			2
this bill will take care of @entity122 , and the market may go up for a few days , but democracy is going downhill			0
" @entity139 in @entity14 will handle arrangements for @entity6 .			2

@entity1 , 91 , became symbol of @entity106 foreclosure crisis
@entity6 remembered as quiet , reserved woman who was *fiercely* *independent*
@entity106 rep. @entity114 mentioned her on @entity149 floor during bailout debate
