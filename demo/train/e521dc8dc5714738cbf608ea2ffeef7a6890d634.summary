@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 said tuesday it has backed a plan aimed at dismantling @entity7 's nuclear facilities by the end of the year , the @entity3 reported			1
@entity7 leader @entity9 , left , welcomes @entity1 president @entity10 in @entity11			1
six nations reached a tentative agreement in @entity14 on sunday but said the plan needed further consideration by their governments			0
the plan was to establish the steps to be taken in the denuclearization process for the remainder of the year , @entity3 reported			2
" we have conveyed to the @entity21 government our approval for the draft statement			0
all the parties went back to their capitals			0
we studied it , examined it , gave our approval to the @entity21			0
i ca n't speak to the status of all the other countries , " @entity33 spokesman @entity32 said , according to @entity3 he declined to comment on specifics of the agreement			0
negotiators have been working to move forward an agreement made in february under which the countries agreed to give @entity7 1 million tons of heavy fuel oil , or the monetary equivalent in other aid and assistance , according to @entity3 @entity7 in return agreed to shut down its main nuclear reactor , which it did in july , and declare and ultimately dismantle all its nuclear programs , @entity3 reported			1
last year , @entity7 tested a nuclear bomb , rattling regional stability and leading to a dramatic turnaround in a previously hard - line @entity4 policy			1
on the eve of this week 's summit , @entity1 president @entity10 told graduating military cadets that his goal is to secure peace on the @entity55			1
@entity10 acknowledged that ridding the @entity7 of nuclear weapons and establishing a peace treaty could not be realized by the two @entity58 alone			2
but he said he would work to establish a concrete agreement on " building military trust and addressing humanitarian matters			0
" earlier tuesday , @entity7 leader @entity9 greeted @entity10 in @entity11 to begin the second summit between the two countries since the peninsula 's division after @entity66 thousands of cheering @entity7 and a military honor guard bearing rifles with bayonets heralded the leaders ' first encounter outside a cultural hall in the @entity7 capital , where @entity10 traveled 3½ hours by road from the @entity1 capital , @entity0			1
the two leaders shook hands , but the only words exchanged were a mutual " glad to meet you			0
" neither made any public comment before @entity10 got back into his armored limousine to travel to the state guesthouse where he is staying for the summit , which runs through thursday			2
watch @entity10 say what he wants to achieve with this summit » @entity10 later attended a welcoming dinner hosted by @entity7 's second most senior leader , @entity88 , president of the @entity89			1
@entity9 did not attend the dinner			0
earlier , @entity10 symbolically walked across the @entity7 's border , pledging to foster peace on the divided peninsula			1
@entity10 became the first leader from either side to cross the border on foot			2
" this line is a wall that has divided the nation for a half - century			0
our people have suffered from too many hardships and development has been held up due to this wall , " @entity10 said , crossing near the @entity7 city of @entity101			2
" this line will be gradually erased and the wall will fall , " he said			0
" i will make efforts to make my walk across the border an occasion to remove the forbidden wall and move toward peace and prosperity			0
" the three - day meeting in @entity11 will mark the first extended appearance of the enigmatic , authoritarian @entity9 before the world since the two @entity58 ' only other summit in june 2000			2
but tuesday 's meeting contrasted with the 2000 summit , when @entity9 warmly greeted the then @entity1 president @entity120			1
the meeting with the @entity7 leader , announced in early august , was initially scheduled for the end of that month but was postponed after massive flooding in @entity11			2
the @entity58 summit comes in the final months of @entity10 's scandal - ridden term , and some analysts suspect the @entity1 leader is hoping the @entity11 meeting will boost his sagging approval ratings and help position his party in the upcoming elections against the conservative opposition			1
a joint statement following the 2000 summit between @entity9 and @entity120 indicated the next meeting between the @entity1 leaders would take place in @entity0			1
@entity10 's decision not to push for a meeting outside the @entity7 capital was criticized by @entity143 of the @entity144 in a recent article titled , " @entity0 's @entity146			1
" " it is indicative of @entity10 's eagerness that he failed to insist on holding the summit in the @entity101 special economic zone in @entity7 to highlight the flagship initiative of @entity0 's engagement policy , " @entity143 wrote			1
but one @entity1 woman said she believes the summit " is our last chance " to negotiate the freedom of hundreds of @entity1 prisoners of war and abductees , including her father , a fisherman on a boat believed abducted by the @entity163 more than 30 years ago			0
other @entity1 have protested the summit -- including one man who set himself on fire during a demonstration in @entity0 -- demanding that @entity10 push @entity7 on its human rights violations during the talks			1
instead , the summit is expected to address military tensions , including settling a sea border dispute on the west coast of the @entity55 , and economic issues , such as how @entity1 businesses can help the @entity7 climb out of extreme poverty			1
the 2000 summit , part of @entity120 's policy of engagement with @entity7 , paved the way for his @entity184 awarded that same year			2
but @entity1 investigators later revealed that @entity120 paid hundreds of millions of dollars to secure the meeting , the first between @entity188 and capitalist @entity1			0
