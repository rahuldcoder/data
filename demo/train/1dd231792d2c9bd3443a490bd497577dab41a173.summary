-- ever wanted your own island ? this one is a veritable bargain if you have a spare $ 2.5 million in the bank			1
with $ 1.5 million already knocked off the asking price , @entity7 admittedly does come with a certain amount of baggage			1
the @entity12 island once housed a prison before acting as a warning beacon for passing ships -- its lighthouse had a keeper until it became automated in 1990			1
in fact , no - one lives there anymore , though it is home to thousands of gannets and an increasing number of puffins , introduced to cull an infestation of rats			0
the upside is that any prospective buyer guarantees themselves a place in @entity31 history thanks to the island 's unique rock , which is used to make the world 's leading curling stones , including all of the 64 in action at this month 's games in @entity38			1
" as far as i know , there 's nowhere else on the planet with granite like it , " says @entity39 , factory manager at @entity40 of @entity12 , which has exclusive rights to harvest it			1
" it 's just a natural phenomenon			0
" the island 's sole export has had its fair share of drama over the years			1
at the @entity54 in @entity55 , one stone in particular became dubbed " the stone of destiny " -- its mystique further enhanced by its current position residing on a pedestal within a glass case of a @entity12 museum			1
with the last stone of the final end of the @entity67 final , @entity12 housewife @entity63 slid @entity68 to gold , a rare @entity37 success for the nation and its first gold for 18 years			1
four years on , @entity73 failed to get her team out of the group stages but the final was no less dramatic as @entity77 captain @entity76 proved victorious with an extra end and a tricky double takeout for the win with her last stone			1
last time around in @entity83 in 2010 , the women 's final reached another climax as @entity77 once more won , coming back from 6 - 4 to win 7 - 6 when @entity86 captain @entity85 fluffed her final stone			2
every one of those can lay claim to being a stone of destiny , and remarkably all of them originate from exactly the same pocket of @entity7 , a 220 - acre island 10 miles from mainland @entity12			1
the name literally translates as fairy rock , but is locally known as @entity99 's milestone -- being situated in the @entity100 virtually equidistant on the boat journey from @entity102 to @entity103			0
created by a volcanic plug of a volcano that was last active 500 million years ago , it was once a haven for @entity108 during the 16th - century @entity109 , a time when a castle was built there to defend against a possible @entity113 invasion			2
curling is not its only claim to sporting fame			2
you can see it in the distance from the @entity121 golf course , which last hosted the @entity122 in 2009 -- when @entity124 @entity123 denied countryman @entity125 the chance to win a sixth @entity122 26 years after his last and at the age of 59			0
there are some provisos in buying the island			2
as well as the lighthouse , the @entity132 has a bird sanctuary leased until 2050			0
there is also one other home on the island -- a rundown property bought a few years ago by a man from @entity139 -- and the issue of the quarried stone			1
for Â £ 26,000 ( $ 43,000 ) a year , the current owners -- @entity143 and the eighth @entity144 -- allow large slabs of rock to be removed to make the world 's finest curling stones			1
the @entity38 batch was extracted back in 2001 , and the next 2,000 - ton excavation did not happen until last year			0
the island 's stone has a market advantage because it does not contain much quartz , says @entity39 , and it does have riebeckite -- a combination that means the stones wo n't break up in competition conditions			1
" as a result it will last you a very long time , a lifetime in fact if you look after it like a baby , " @entity39 explains			0
" i would n't say we put in more effort with the @entity38 stones but we probably double - checked things even more -- maybe an extra 1 - 2 % to make sure it was just right			2
" the curling stones used in @entity38 are made of two types of granite : @entity7 common green and blue hone			1
the green makes up the main body of the stone , with blue filling the middle and providing the base			0
" blue hone is the hardest granite in the world and it wo n't wear and tear -- that 's the objective , " @entity39 says			0
" it will certainly last for many , many years			0
" the only other place that granite is quarried for curling is @entity188 , using trefor , which comes in blue / gray and red / brown shades , and is commonly found in competitions in @entity86			2
it is still an active quarry where blasting is allowed , a process banned on @entity7 due to its bird sanctuary			0
following the latest excavation , however , @entity195 believes it now has enough granite to meet demand until 2020			0
and regardless of who purchases the island , a lease is in place ensuring that @entity195 can continue to meet the demands of the @entity205			2
as things stand , curling 's very long - term future looks likely to rest in the hands of a nature conservation body , which wants to remain nameless but has tabled an offer for @entity7			1
@entity212 , who runs @entity213 in @entity214 , @entity215 , the world 's leading private island broker , has tried to use @entity7 's sporting past as a major selling point to prospective buyers			0
" how many islands can boast its own olympic gold medal ? " he asks			0
as for the future stone production in the very long - term , he adds : " this discussion is ongoing at the moment with the group looking to buy it			1
obviously it 's very special stone and it 's a chance of an income of about Â £ 30,000 a year to the owner			0
" no other buyers look immediately on the horizon -- the @entity205 told @entity0 it will not make a bid			0
other wealthy curling fanatics could yet enter the fray , but whatever the outcome , @entity7 will play a key role on the @entity38 ice -- with or without another stone of destiny .			2

an island 10 miles off @entity12 is the sole place to supply @entity67 curling stones
it has provided each and every stone for all the *climactic* finishes to recent olympics
the island is for sale for anyone with a cool $ 2.5 million to spare
nature conservation group has tabled an offer to buy it from the @entity260
