@entity0 -- in one of the most immediate consequences of the pending spending cuts , the @entity2 has informed contractors that -- lacking any last - minute agreement -- the agency will move monday to close some 168 contractor - staffed air traffic control towers nationwide on april 1 , and another 21 towers by sept. 30 , industry officials tell @entity1			1
all of the control towers are at small - and medium - size airports , but together they handle about 5.8 % of all commercial airline traffic , and considerably more business and private airplane traffic			1
the cuts will not force the closure of the airports , because aircraft can land without air traffic control help , and some operations can be switched to other @entity2 facilities			1
but airport authorities say the move will eliminate one level of safety at affected airports and will reduce the efficiency of the entire airspace system			2
the @entity2 's first concrete action to address the $ 85 billion in spending cuts -- known in @entity0 as the sequestration -- is aimed at three contractors			1
while the @entity2 uses its own workforce of some 14,700 controllers to staff about 280 control towers at major airports , it contracts with three companies to staff roughly another 250 towers , generally at smaller airports			1
spending cuts threaten military town 's business representatives of those companies told @entity1 the @entity2 has notified them verbally that they will be receiving written notice by monday about the pending tower closures			1
" to us and our people , it 's extremely significant , " said @entity51 , ceo of @entity52 , which provides controllers to towers in about 23 states in the @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and central regions of the @entity60			2
" we 're talking not only about a loss of jobs but , from my perspective , a negative impact to the safety and efficiency of the national airspace system , " he said			0
@entity51 said the @entity2 's contract tower program " has been repeatedly lauded by the ( @entity72 's ) office of inspector general as a cost effective and safe program			2
" the program " enhanced the @entity2 's attempts to be fiscally responsible while remaining operationally safe and efficient , " he said			2
in addition to the contract towers , the @entity2 has said it is contemplating closing 49 @entity2 - staffed towers			1
and it has notified most of its 47,000 employees of the possibility of furloughs , expected to be one or two days every two - week pay period			2
@entity86 of the @entity60 @entity87 , an airport industry group , said contract towers are taking a disproportionate brunt of the closures			2
in addition to the 168 towers to be closed april 1 , some 16 towers that are operated on a cost - sharing basis with other governments , and five operated with the @entity96 , will be closed sept. 30			1
" we 're very discouraged and we still think that the @entity72 and @entity2 ought to scrub the budget harder to find savings that do n't affect the control towers , " @entity86 said			1
budget cuts would hit private air traffic in effort to spare airlines " will it be unsafe ? no. they 'll figure it out , but are there concerns about safety ? absolutely			0
are there concerns about efficiency ? absolutely			0
is this a job killer ? absolutely , " @entity86 said			0
" it 's unprecedented that we 're going to turn the lights off on 168 towers on april 1 , and we do n't have any information from the @entity2 on how that 's going to work , " he said			1
the @entity2 targeted airfields with fewer than 150,000 operations -- an operation is a takeoff or landing -- or 10,000 commercial operations in a year			2
the agency said it is open to reconsidering closures on a " case by case " basis , but would have to offset any changes with other spending cuts			1
congressional republicans have criticized the planned tower closures , saying the administration is " creating alarm " as a negotiating gambit			0
in a statement , three @entity144 said , " the agency is well positioned to absorb spending reductions without compromising the safety or efficiency of the @entity142			0
" the statement was released by @entity147 chairman @entity146 , @entity148 , @entity150 ranking member @entity149 , @entity151 , and @entity152 on aviation chairman @entity153 , @entity154			0
@entity155 , head of @entity156 , which staffs control towers in the @entity2 's @entity160 and @entity161 regions , said he is " saddened " by the pending closures			1
@entity155 said an @entity2 contracting official gave him notice that it intends to close 77 of his towers , jeopardizing the jobs of more than 400 of his employees			1
" we 're not sure how the process worked to get to this point , so i really ca n't comment on that			0
we really do n't know			0
if they had cut 20 % , maybe that would be understandable			0
but it looks like they cut almost the entire program out , " @entity155 said			0
" we 're hopeful that somebody will come to a conclusion that changes this , " @entity155 said			0
" personally , i 'm not hopeful that they 'll make it			0
" " i 'm hopeful , " he said , correcting himself			0
" but i 'm not confident			0
" spending cuts : when they 'll really bite			1

@entity185 makes contingency plans over spending cuts
control towers at *dozens* of airports may be closed
most are small or medium , operated by contractors
