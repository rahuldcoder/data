-- an undersea cable carrying internet traffic was cut off the @entity5 emirate of @entity6 , officials said friday , the third loss of a line carrying @entity10 and telephone traffic in three days			1
@entity6 has been hit hard by an internet outage apparently caused by a cut undersea cable			1
ships have been dispatched to repair two undersea cables damaged on wednesday off @entity15			0
@entity16 , which owns one of the cables , said repairs were expected to be completed by february 12			1
@entity20 , part owner of the other cable , said it was uncertain when repairs on it would be repaired			1
@entity26 , an analyst with @entity27 , a research company that consults on global internet issues , said the cables off @entity15 were likely damaged by ships ' anchors			2
the loss of the two @entity34 cables -- @entity16 's @entity37 - @entity36 cable and @entity38 , a cable owned by a consortium of more than a dozen telecommunications companies -- has snarled @entity10 and phone traffic from @entity15 to @entity42			1
officials said friday it was unclear what caused the damage to @entity16 's falcon cable about 50 kilometers off @entity6			1
a repair ship was en route , @entity16 said			0
@entity50 , a senior analyst with @entity27 , said the @entity52 cable is designed on a " ring system , " taking it on a circuit around the @entity5 and enabling traffic to be more easily routed around damage			1
@entity50 said the two cables damaged wednesday collectively account for as much as three - quarters of the international communications between @entity37 and the @entity61 , so their loss had a much bigger effect			1
without the use of the @entity37 - @entity36 cable and @entity38 , some carriers were forced to reroute their @entity68 traffic around the globe , which could cause delays , @entity26 said			1
other carriers could use @entity72 , an older cable that remained the only direct connection from @entity37 to the @entity61 and @entity36			1
because this cable is older , it has a smaller capacity than the two damaged cables , @entity26 said			0
still , @entity26 stressed that although the problem created a " big pain " for many of carriers , it did not compare to the several months of disruption in @entity36 in 2006 after an earthquake damaged seven undersea cables near @entity86			2
@entity27 research director @entity87 said new cables planned to link @entity37 with @entity15 should provide enough backup to prevent most similar problems in the future			0
@entity50 said a similar @entity10 problem could not happen in the @entity93			1
" we have all the content here , " he said			0
" it 's not going to be felt other than we wo n't get the @entity98			0
" @entity27 officials also said most traffic between the @entity93 , @entity101 and @entity102 is carried over land , and there is a plentiful supply of undersea cables carrying traffic under the @entity109 and @entity110 oceans			2
meanwhile , internet service was slow friday in @entity6 and @entity15 , where online service was intermittent , but there was less demand because many businesses in those countries are n't open on fridays			1
service providers in @entity15 said they hoped to have improved capacity by sunday			0
web surfers in @entity42 were experiencing a marked improvement in service , though graphic - or video - heavy sites were still taking longer to load			0
most of the major internet service providers in @entity42 , like @entity125 and @entity126 , were starting to use backup lines friday , allowing service to slowly come back , said @entity129 , president of the @entity130 of @entity42			2
the @entity42 isps were still alerting customers to slowdowns over the next few days with service quality delays of 50 percent to 60 percent , he said			0
the internet slowdowns had no effect on trading at the country 's two main stock exchanges , the @entity139 and the @entity140 , because they are n't dependent on the downed cables , @entity129 said			0
individual web users were still feeling the effects			0
@entity144 , who lives in the city of @entity146 on the outskirts of @entity148 , said she uses internet phone service @entity150 to call her son in the @entity93 , but she has n't been able to reach him since the slowdown			1
" we keep trying for a long time and the message comes up , ' this page ca n't display , ' so finally we just turn the computer off and give up , " @entity144 said			0
internet cafes typically full of teenaged gamers are nearly empty with speeds still frustratingly slow			0
" i felt like beating the ... modem , throwing it away , because we compete on the @entity10 and it feels really bad , " said @entity162 , 13			2
state - owned @entity6 telecom provider @entity165 and @entity168 's @entity167 estimated thursday that the problems might take two weeks to fix			2
e-mail to a friend @entity0 's @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
