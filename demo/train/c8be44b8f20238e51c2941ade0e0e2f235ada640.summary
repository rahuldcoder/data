-- authorities have found a second homemade explosive and more of a type of explosive previously discovered in a house in an unincorporated area near @entity7 , @entity8 , officials said thursday			1
the house occupied by @entity10 , a computer software consultant who is now under arrest , has been described by authorities as a bomb - making factory			1
they say it holds the largest cache of the two homemade explosives ever discovered in one spot in the @entity20			1
@entity22 authorities confirmed thursday they have found pentaerythritol tetranitrate , or @entity24 , a favorite of @entity27 bomb - makers that is now the target of new @entity20 airport body scans and pat downs			1
they also found more hexamethylene triperoxide diamine , or @entity33 , in a bottle inside the house , but the two types of homemade explosives were not immediately removed because they are too volatile and the house is too cluttered to negotiate safely , assistant sheriff @entity30 said			1
authorities had already recovered 8 or 9 pounds of @entity33 , an explosive powder that suicide bombers use , authorities said			1
the search of the house also turned up items " suggestive of armed robberies , " @entity30 said in a written statement			1
in addition to bomb - making charges , @entity10 , 54 , is charged with two bank robberies			1
now being held in lieu of $ 5 million bail , he was on probation for a 2009 burglary conviction when he was arrested last week			0
authorities are investigating @entity10 's intentions			1
he is a @entity55 national who is a naturalized @entity20 citizen , and he lived in the house with his wife			1
authorities also found wednesday more blasting caps , adding to others discovered in the past week , but they were not removed from the house , officials said			1
a @entity22 hazardous materials team removed chemicals from a shed on the property , authorities said			2
they included about 4 liters of hydrochloric acid , 1 liter of nitric acid , 25 gallons of sulfuric acid and 50 pounds of hexamine			2
a bomb squad from @entity22 agencies and the @entity71 has suspended a search inside the home until wednesday , as authorities study how to proceed within the cramped , cluttered home without causing a blast , @entity30 said			1
authorities also found inside the house some more hazardous chemicals , which also wo n't be moved for now , he said			1
the sheriff 's department has secured a perimeter around the suburban house and closed the street off except to residents , @entity30 said			2
one explosives expert described the eight or nine pounds of previously discovered hmtd as potentially " devastating			1
" " if you had 8 or 9 pounds in a vehicle in a street , you have a pretty large and devastating car bomb , " said @entity85 , a retired special agent of the federal @entity86			1
" inside a home , it 's going to blow all the windows and doors and walls out , but it 's not going to destroy the neighborhood			0
people would be in danger if they were immediately in front of the house or adjacent to the house , " he said			2
" it would be almost like a gas explosion			2
" bomb squads must be wary of potential booby traps , @entity85 said			2
" these explosives , like @entity33 , i call the devil 's own mixtures , and they can be set off by shock , friction , static electricity , heat , flame or even a chemical reaction , " he said			2
" added to the danger is that they are difficult to find in a filthy hoarder 's hovel			0
" outside court this week , @entity10 's wife , @entity120 , was distraught			0
" he 's crazy , " she told camera crews			0
" i think he lost his mind			0
he lost his mind or something			0
... i know that he was collecting , obsessively collecting stuff			0
" bomb technicians must work slowly inside the house because the slightest friction -- such as opening a drawer -- could ignite the explosives , @entity30 said			1
@entity10 appears to be a hoarder , and the clutter of paper and boxes in the house makes the hunt for explosives more difficult , the assistant sheriff said			2
bomb crews were wearing less gear so they can move about the house without brushing up against anything and accidentally triggering the explosives , he said			1
" we are wearing some protective gear , not the big protective gear " that resembles moon suits , @entity30 said			0
" it 's just not practical for this operation			0
" authorities discovered the explosives last thursday after a gardener was injured when he unwittingly set off some of the hmtd powder in the back yard , @entity30 said			1
the blast went up one side of his body , from lower leg to head , he said			2
" we believe he scraped against some of the powder in the yard , and the friction caused it to explode , " @entity30 said			2
" apparently the suspect was experimenting in his yard , and some of it got left over " the ground , he added			0
the 8 or 9 pounds of hmtd was in six jars that had apparently been moved out of the house and into the back yard , he said			1
last friday , authorities had to evacuate two nearby houses and even closed down the southbound lanes of nearby @entity180 for three hours , he said			2
the two adjacent houses remained evacuated wednesday , he said			0
" it 's amazing he did n't blow himself up			0
he must have some knowledge of how to do this safely , " @entity30 said			0
" part of the story should be about the bravery of the bomb technicians and haz - mat team , for risking their lives trying to build a case against this guy so that justice can be served , and trying to render the site safe so that homeowners can return to their homes , " he added			1
during wednesday 's search , only two or three bomb technicians entered the house for less than an hour and seized a computer and other items , @entity30 said			1
the crew videotaped the interior and will review the tape later to determine their next mission , officials said			0
in recent days , technicians found improvised grenades that were n't live , he said			1
" if you look at the video of this , you can see items piled on top of items			0
it gives you a mental picture of how difficult it is , " @entity30 said			0
" counter space and tables , every bit of space had items piled on top of items -- papers and boxes			0
" we only pull things out that have easy access , " he added			0
law officers have defined " a hot zone " consisting of the house itself and the two nearby evacuated houses			2
a " warm zone " is the street in front of the house , and a " cold zone " is the area beyond a police tape where the media and public are allowed to stand , @entity30 said			0
at night , after bomb crews have finished their work , the hot zone is reduced to just the house , he said			1
authorities said the hmtd discovered inside the house wednesday is stored in a bottle			1
" we have not removed it yet			0
it 's too dangerous to move			0
any movement can set it off , " @entity30 said			0
" we have a saying : we 'll go as fast as we can but slow as we must , " he added .			0
