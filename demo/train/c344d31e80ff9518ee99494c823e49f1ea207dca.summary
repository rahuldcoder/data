-- match - fixing is a " disease " that could kill football , a top official at the sport 's world governing body told @entity0 on wednesday			1
earlier this month @entity7 handed lifetime bans to 41 @entity10 players who had been involved in prearranging matches			1
it followed december 's suspension of the president of the @entity15 ahead of an investigation into match - fixing in the country prior to it hosting the @entity20			1
" i really think that it 's a disease and a threat which is on a worldwide basis , " @entity7 's general secretary @entity21 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			1
" it 's not just about @entity27			2
it is in @entity31 , it is in @entity32 , it is in @entity33 , it is in @entity34 , it is in @entity36			0
it 's all around the world that this match - fixing , or match manipulation , is active			1
" @entity21 was speaking after @entity32 football chief @entity41 branded match - fixing the greatest threat to the future of football in an interview with a @entity47 radio station			1
@entity41 had warned that football is " dead " if the outcome of matches is prearranged , a statement @entity21 echoed by saying the appeal of the sport lies in its unpredictability			2
" if you know the end of the party , of the game , then definitely football is dead , " he said			0
" that 's the beauty of the game , you never know who will be the winner			0
" it can be the team you think would win , but it can also be the other team , the opponent who can make it because it 's just played on one goal			0
so that 's why we have to protect football as much as we can			2
" @entity21 warned that the fight against the highly lucrative match - fixing business could take 10 years , and urged anyone with knowledge of such activity to come forward			1
in may 2011 @entity7 announced it would donate over $ 25 million to @entity75 over 10 years -- the largest grant the world police organization had ever received from a private body -- with a view to tackling corruption			2
" when i was in @entity81 where we had this meeting with @entity75 and 50 of the 53 of the @entity32 associations , i heard that the business of match manipulation per year is around 100 billion			0
i do n't know it is in euros or @entity87 ( dollars ) , but whatever , it is 100 billion , it 's an amazing figure , " @entity21 said			2
" i think it will be a very , very long fight and it will be very difficult to win			0
and if we want to win , it is all together			0
also i told some media in @entity27 , if you are aware of anything you should tell us			0
we have to fight all			0
" all the people who love football should be together towards match - fixing			1
but it will not be a fight of one day as we have other fights which have been there already			0
and match manipulation will be another fight that will be there for the next decade			0
" former @entity75 director @entity107 replaced @entity7 's former head of security @entity109 -- who joined a @entity112 - based sports security consultancy -- in june last year , tasked with tackling the scourge of match - fixing			1
in the past @entity7 's own governance has been questioned			2
corruption watchdog @entity116 cut its ties with the body in 2011 when two of its recommendations -- that the investigator charged with overseeing @entity7 would be compromised if he was paid by @entity7 and that he should be allowed to investigate old corruption scandals -- were dropped			0
" there is no limit in what we have to do in order to make sure we can eradicate match - fixing one day in our game , " @entity21 said			1
" or at least to make sure that match - fixing is not a threat anymore to our game			1
