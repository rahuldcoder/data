sweet odds it may have been the one in six odds of winning , but the race was hilariously intense from the beginning			0
with challenges ranging from eating as many " suicide wings " as possible in three minutes to wrapping dim sum to fileting fish , six local teams and six expat teams battled it out to win two grand prizes of a trip to @entity42 , and customized food tours of @entity9 with @entity11 for runners up			1
@entity6 judged the roast goose leg challenge -- it 's his favorite @entity9 food -- that had teams hunting for a secret kitchen to chop up goose legs			1

the @entity63 had each team heading to the street market to bargain for as much choi sum ( a leafy green vegetable ) as possible for hk $ 30 , the average amount people in @entity9 living under the poverty line spend on food each day			2
the veggies were then donated to feeding @entity9 , @entity0 's charity partner for the event			1
social media was another important element of the contest , as contestants were required to have a @entity23 and @entity22 account to register			0
