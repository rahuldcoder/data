-- the water is so clear you can see it from the surface			2
it 's the @entity6 ' newest tourist attraction , the @entity7			1
the @entity8 is a @entity10 - class submarine rescue ship that was part of the @entity12 's fleet until it was decommissioned in 1994			1
now it 's an artificial reef , one that @entity15 magazine says is a must for divers			2
" it is definitely one of the top 10 purposely sunk wrecks because of its accessibility , " says the magazine 's editor , @entity18			2
" it 's in relatively shallow water and it 's upright			0
" the @entity8 was sunk a little over a year ago just off @entity29 's popular @entity28			2
a five - minute boat ride brings divers to the site where the vessel 's bottom sits about 60 feet down on the sandy floor of the @entity36			1
getting the 251 - foot - long ship to the bottom of the ocean was easy , unlike the effort to obtain the vessel			2
" it was a pilot project and that was part of the complexity of it , " says @entity42 , who spearheaded the @entity7 project on behalf of the @entity44			0
the @entity6 applied to the @entity51 government to receive a decommissioned ship to use as an artificial reef , a process that was open for the first time to international applicants			1
then @entity42 journeyed to @entity57 , @entity58 , to tour the available ships			0
she says choosing the @entity7 was the easy part of her eight - year effort			0
" she was a ship that served divers all of her life , " she says , " so it just seemed the appropriate ship			1
" before the vessel could be transported to its new home , it had to be cleared of all military equipment , undergo an inspection for hazardous materials and pass environmental regulations in the @entity51 and the @entity6			1
as a submarine rescue vessel , the @entity8 was home to many @entity12 divers during its 49 years of service			1
when built , it was outfitted with a recompression chamber , a diving bell and a diving locker			0
but the ship 's highlight for most divers today is an unlikely place : the vessel 's head			1
" they 've left the mirrors inside the bathrooms , so you can actually take a look at yourself while diving , " says @entity95 , an instructor with local dive company @entity96 's			1
but you do n't have to be a diver to appreciate this new attraction			0
" it 's the only wreck i 've been around where you can snorkel on it and see what we see as divers , " @entity95 adds			0
" the only thing you do n't see as a snorkeler is what is inside			0
" in just over a year , a ship that might have ended up in the scrapheap has been transformed into a must - see for visitors			0
inside there are five decks with the stairs intact			0
a dive will take you through the recreation room , mess hall , crew quarters , navigation room and up to the main deck , which sits about 15 feet from the water 's surface			1
" the warmth of the water and the visibility is incredible , so you can see the whole ship from the surface , " says @entity42			1
" it 's kind of eerie because it 's something that does n't belong there but on the other hand , it 's quite friendly to divers and snorkelers			2
" the vessel has also quickly become a friendly spot for marine life			0
recently , the island was abuzz when a whale shark was spotted near the ship .			0

a decommissioned @entity12 ship has become a popular @entity6 dive site
the top of the ship is close to the surface and accessible to snorkelers
divers can *explore* the inside of the submarine rescue ship
