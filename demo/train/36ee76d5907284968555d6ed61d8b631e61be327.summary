-- @entity1 , the app that sends automatically - deleting messages , has proven to be hugely popular among teens and young adults , but until now , it restricted anyone under the age of 13 from using it			1
on saturday , @entity1 decided to change their policy by introducing an update that lets younger users register for a more limited version of the app , which the startup has dubbed @entity16			1
see also : this college student is the @entity19 " instead they are able to use ' @entity16 ' a version of @entity1 that includes an interface for taking snaps , captioning , drawing , and saving them locally on the device , but does not support sending or receiving snaps or adding friends , " the company wrote in a blog post			1
in essence , @entity16 is just a photo and drawing app for kids , which lacks @entity1 's main feature : sending messages			2
the kid - friendly option is currently only available as part of an update to the @entity40 app , but may roll out to android in the future			0
the move comes as @entity1 is reportedly looking to raise a big new round of funding			2
by introducing a more pg - version of the app for younger users , @entity1 may be able to boost its user numbers and change the perception that it is simply a tool for sexting			1
of course , users can also lie about their age and continue using the app 's full features			0
