@entity0 again refused to reveal whether she voted for president @entity1 , dodging the question for the second time in a week monday during the only debate of @entity6 's @entity5 race			1
@entity0 , the @entity7 secretary of state who is challenging @entity5 minority leader @entity8 in one of the nation 's marquee races , cited the " matter of principle " of privacy at the ballot box , noting that she is the state 's chief election officer			1
" i 'm not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in @entity6 in order to curry favor on one or ( an ) other side or members of the media , " she said during monday night 's debate			2
the answer echoed one she gave the @entity27 's editorial board last week , which touched off days of criticism -- with @entity30 " @entity29 " moderator @entity31 saying that @entity0 " disqualified herself , " and @entity34 's campaign immediately placing that comment in a new ad			1
it came after @entity34 had already blasted @entity0 for trying to hide her political allegiances in a state where @entity1 is deeply unpopular			1
" my opponent has spent spent most of her time trying to deceive everybody about her own views , " the five - term @entity40 said			0
@entity34 also criticized @entity0 ' answer on whether she voted for @entity1 , saying there is " no sacred right to not announce how we vote			1
" he offered that he had " proudly " voted for @entity40 nominees @entity51 in 2008 and @entity52 in 2012 , and said he voted for @entity53 during @entity6 's 2010 primary against now - sen. @entity55			1
@entity34 also said he does n't buy @entity0 ' claim that she is a " @entity58 @entity57			2
" " there 's not a dime 's worth of difference between a @entity58 @entity57 and an @entity1 @entity57 , " he said			2
the debate was the only chance @entity6 voters will have to see the two candidates grapple personally in what 's been one of the nation 's most expensive races , and one of about a dozen that are key to @entity40 ' chances of seizing at least six more seats and taking control of the @entity5			1
the free - wheeling , hour - long event was almost entirely negative -- with @entity0 calling @entity34 " senator gridlock , senator no - show or senator shutdown , " painting him as an obstructionist and accusing him of doing the bidding of conservative political funding giants @entity82 and @entity81			0
she referred to the @entity81 brothers as @entity34 's " family , " and later , his " henchmen			0
" much of the debate was focused on coal , with @entity0 criticizing the @entity1 administration 's move to curb emissions from coal - fired power plants by 30 % over the next 25 years and @entity34 going even harder after the @entity95 and saying @entity0 would be a reliable @entity1 supporter on issues like energy			1
" it 's pretty obvious , given where all her support comes from , all the anti-coal activists in the country , that she 's going to do their bidding , " he said			0
the two also tangled over @entity0 ' push to increase the minimum wage and equal pay legislation , and @entity0 landed a shot against @entity34 for putting " two wars on a nation 's credit card			0
" @entity0 benefited late in the debate from a series of questions on @entity115 that demonstrated the difficulties @entity40 candidates face in states that have already expanded access to coverage under the 2010 health care law			2
@entity6 's @entity7 governor , @entity122 , accepted the federal @entity124 expansion and set up a state - run insurance exchange called @entity126			1
@entity34 said he wants to repeal the health care law " root and branch " and that hospitals " are being rim - racked by these @entity131 reimbursement reductions			0
" but he would n't address the future of @entity126 , saying that " it 's a state decision " and that " it 's fine to have a website			0
" @entity0 said @entity34 is living in a " fictional fantasyland " on the issue and that more than 500,000 @entity6 residents now have health insurance because of the law			2
" i will not be the senator that rips that insurance from their hands , " she said			0
several times @entity0 said @entity34 had already had 30 years to carry his policy ideas through			0
but @entity34 shot back that he was the one who negotiated several bipartisan efforts to extend the debt ceiling and stave off government shutdowns with vice president @entity153 in recent years			0
and he argued that a possible future role would position him to advance @entity6 's interests			1
" there 's a great likelihood , " @entity34 said , " that i will be the leader of the majority in the @entity5 next year			0

@entity6 's @entity7 @entity5 candidate wo n't say if she voted for president @entity1
@entity0 cited the " matter of principle " of privacy at the ballot box
@entity40 sen. @entity8 criticized her answer , said he voted for @entity51 , @entity52
