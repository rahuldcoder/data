-- the @entity1 is under siege on @entity3			2
" @entity7 is now more polarized than at any time since the late 19th century , " attests the data - driven blog @entity6			2
it has gotten so bad that sen. @entity10 is throwing in the towel on her three - term career in disgust : " i do find it frustrating , " she said , " that an atmosphere of polarization and ' my way or the highway ' ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions			1
" what 's worse , she does n't think it 's going to get better any time soon : " i do not realistically expect the partisanship of recent years in the @entity26 to change over the short term			1
" it 's just the latest confirmation of what you know in your gut : our politics have become hijacked by hyper - partisans			2
our divided @entity7 is dysfunctional			2
the @entity39 @entity38 's comments echoed @entity42 democrat @entity41 's statement when he announced he would n't seek re-election in 2010 : " for some time , i have had a growing conviction that @entity7 is not operating as it should , " @entity41 said			1
" there is much too much partisanship and not enough progress			2
too much narrow ideology and not enough practical problem solving			0
" how many times will we need to hear the same refrain before we start taking these warnings seriously ? @entity10 's announcement follows @entity56 sen. @entity55 's decision to not run for re-election after being attacked for compiling a record as the most conservative @entity41 left in the @entity26			1
independent sen. @entity59 , @entity61 's pick for vice president and @entity64 's close ally , has also announced his retirement , for similar reasons			0
in 2006 , @entity59 found himself under attack from the left for his post- 9/11 support of the @entity70 and won re-election as an independent after a lifetime as a centrist @entity41			1
conservatives have long gloried in the sport of rino - hunting , trying to defeat what they call " @entity77 " in closed partisan primaries			1
longtime centrist @entity38 sen. @entity79 is the latest to be targeted in this cycle			1
now liberal democrats are trying to get into the game			0
these professional partisans believe the cure for what ails our political system is further polarization			0
they are peddling a view of politics as an @entity92 ideological war , the strategy : mutually assured destruction			0
certainly , the ranks of centrist @entity38 , operating in a grand tradition dating back to at least @entity97 , have been diminished			1
the number of northeast republicans remaining in @entity7 can be counted on two hands			0
likewise , the ranks of @entity102 -- resurgent during the new @entity41 centrism of the @entity104 years -- have been cut in half			0
@entity107 's @entity106 , who worked across the aisle most recently to try to achieve a grand bargain with a $ 4 trillion deficit reduction , wo n't run for re-election			2
neither will @entity115 's lone @entity114 congressman , rep. @entity113			0
" it is not surprising to hear the news of sen. @entity10 's retirement , " @entity113 e-mailed me			1
" she , like many of us in the center , have watched with dismay the further polarization of our politics			0
this is caused by an out of control campaign finance system which includes super pacs , the gerrymandering of congressional districts and a @entity7 that puts party above the national interest at almost every turn			2
" republicans might soon learn to regret the departure of centrists like @entity10 for purely practical reasons : their attempts to take back control of the @entity26 in the 2012 election just got a lot tougher			1
@entity10 was hugely popular in her home state despite some tea party grousing			1
it is , after all , one of the states where registered independents outnumber @entity102 or @entity38			1
but now her seat is likely to be won by a @entity41 , leaving republicans fighting to pick up another			2
a half century ago , congressional voting patterns resembled a bell curve -- with some congress members voting on the far left and far right , but most clustered in the center			0
not coincidentally , this also reflected the spread of political opinions held by most @entity160			1
there were liberal republicans and conservative @entity102			0
the result was that creative cross-aisle coalitions could be formed to pass major legislation			0
during divided government in the past , we passed the @entity168 and the @entity169			0
all the @entity171 legislative accomplishments were passed with divided government -- the same was true of welfare reform and the balanced budgets of the @entity104 years			0
but now divided government means dysfunctional government			0
there is no trust and little cooperation			0
as a result , @entity7 has the lowest approval ratings on record			0
they can not reason together and solve problems			0
the departure of centrists like @entity10 will make that job much harder in the foreseeable future			1
their frustration with the status quo should be a huge wake - up call to the moderate majority of @entity160			1
the two parties may be polarized , but the @entity160 people are not			1
we need to send that message loud and clear to the professional partisans who are invested in polarization			0
make no mistake , the dysfunction will not get better until we change this corrosive culture of conformity in our politics			1
" i see a vital need for the political center in order for our democracy to flourish and to find solutions that unite rather than divide us			0
it is time for change in the way we govern , " said @entity10 in her statement			1
" we must return to an era of civility in government driven by a common purpose to fulfill the promise that is unique to @entity160			1
" i 'll devote my next column to some ways we can start to push back on the dysfunctional congressional culture the hyper - partisans have created			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			2

@entity226 : @entity229 up with partisan dysfunction , @entity10 not seeking re-election
she is among politicians targeted by own party for being centrist , a *damaging* trend , he says
@entity38 may live to regret this , he says : her leaving will make it tough to regain the @entity26
@entity226 : this should be wake - up call for moderate @entity160
