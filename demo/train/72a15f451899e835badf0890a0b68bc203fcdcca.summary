-- it lit up the world and showed us all our way			2
it served presidents , princes , and paupers with equal alacrity			2
it brought the writings of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 to millions of bed - readers , and helped countless people around the world avoid stubbing their toes in the dark			1
and now , it is no more			0
@entity21 , traditional light bulb			1
as the clock strikes midnight , the light dims on your reign as the mechanical illuminator of human existence			2
this was no sudden death			0
the diagnosis came in years ago , in 2007 , when president @entity34 signed a law to replace standard incandescents with more efficient bulbs			1
only about 10 % of the energy these traditional bulbs use is for light , the @entity38 says			1
seventy - five - and 100 - watt bulbs were already banned this year			1
the ban on production of 40 and 60 - watt bulbs -- the most popular in the country -- kicks in as 2014 begins			1
" there are 4 billion light bulb sockets in the @entity49 and more than 3 billion of them still use the standard incandescent technology that has n't changed much in 125 years , " the @entity38 says			1
" a standard incandescent is only 10 % efficient -- the other 90 % of the electricity it uses is lost as heat			1
" it 's the dawn of a new day			0
taking over the limelight now : halogen bulbs , compact fluorescent bulbs , led bulbs and high efficiency incandescents			2
while @entity63 has covered the business behind all this , as well as the battle over whether it 's a sign of too much government meddling , on this @entity69 , we 're left with the sad sense of saying goodbye to you , sweet standard -- but also the knowledge that your legacy will irradiate our world , brighter than ever			1
born in 1803 or later , depending on how you measure it , you , in all your transformational beauty , were raised by more parents than we could name -- @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , and , of course , @entity88 , the @entity81 notes			0
while , unlike president @entity90 , you have no birth certificate , we will always treasure @entity88 's patent of you from january 27 , 1880			0
and we find solace in knowing that he just might be glad to see you exit gracefully , making way for the next generation			0
" @entity88 was a patriot , he was a futurist , and he was green			0
@entity88 's concern after the turn of the last century was with pollution and nonrenewable resources , not with freezing technological change at the level of 1879 , " @entity98 , @entity88 's great grandson , wrote for @entity0 under the headline , " @entity88 would 've loved new light bulb law			1
" still , some are n't quite as ready to let go			0
and , in a way , they wo n't have to			0
as with all laws , there are some loopholes			0
three - way standard incandescent light bulbs will still be made			1
yes , we live in an era of space stations , blazing fast computers , and access to just about any piece of information we need			0
but no one can take away the glory of that click - click - click you give us in our hotel - room lamps			2
so , for those who just ca n't quit you yet , some enterprising shop owners have a plan			0
" any regular lamp , you can change it from an on - and - off to a three - way , and we do it for our customers here , " @entity131 , owner of @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity135			2
but in the not - so - long run , we know , your gleaming presence in our lives is fading			2
today 's children wo n't know you as previous generations did			0
at @entity63 , a commenter calling himself @entity145 posted his concern -- and received hundreds of " upvotes " for it			0
i do all of my baking in a small oven that uses a light bulb at its heat source			1
now what ? " worry not , @entity145			0
the easy - bake oven has changed with the times			2
" no more light bulbs needed ! " @entity160 says in its ad for the @entity162			1
as @entity163 reported , @entity160 revised its classic in response to the new law			0
the new lights taking over our lives will surely bring joy and less wasted energy -- perhaps a beautiful new beginning			1
still , on two of life 's most pressing questions , we remain in the dark : what will happen when a cartoon character gets a great idea ? on this , @entity180 offers some suggestions			0
and , finally , how many psychiatrists / lawyers / programmers / med students / economists / surrealists will it now take to change a light bulb ? oh , there are new ones that look the same ? problems solved			1
here 's to you , standard incandescent light bulb			1
may the fireworks that light up the skies this evening give you the blazing sendoff you deserve .			2

standard incandescent light bulbs will no longer be *manufactured*
they 're being replaced by more energy - efficient bulbs
a standard bulb only puts 10 % of its energy into light , the @entity38 says
three - way standard lights will still be made
