-- is hip design more important than being green ? technology giant @entity2 is catching heat on blogs this week for its decision to drop out of an environmental certification program for electronics , called @entity8			1
" in making this move , @entity2 is signaling that it wo n't let future design decisions be governed by those seeking to uphold environmental standards , " @entity9 writes for the @entity11 blog network			2
the decision has some strong ramifications			0
by @entity20 law , 95 % of electronics purchases from @entity20 federal agencies must be @entity8 - compliant , said @entity22 , spokeswoman for the group			2
that probably means @entity2 desktop and laptop computers can make up a maximum of 5 % of federal agencies ' purchases , if they can buy them at all			0
@entity8 does n't certify tablets or phones , so @entity33 and @entity34 would be ok for the agencies to buy , @entity22 said			0
@entity36 also has a rule on the books prohibiting the city from purchasing desktop and laptop computers that are not epeat - certified , said @entity41 , spokeswoman for the mayor			0
so the city will not be able to purchase @entity2 desktops and laptops unless @entity2 gets the green certification again			1
" we hope they reconsider and get back on the @entity8 certification list , " @entity41 said , " and we 'll be reaching out to them to see how we can help understand their decision			0
" @entity2 has n't commented on why it removed itself from @entity8 , which is awarded to electronics that are recyclable and energy - efficient			1
but @entity8 's ceo , @entity54 , says @entity2 's " design direction " may be to blame			1
" they said their design direction was no longer consistent with the @entity8 requirements , " @entity54 told the @entity56			1
" they were important supporters and we are disappointed that they do n't want their products measured by this standard anymore			0
" so what 's the design hangup ? there 's speculation that @entity2 's new line of " retina display " laptops are n't easily recyclable because their batteries are glued to the aluminum case on the computer			1
" at the heart of the controversy is the company 's newest @entity77 with @entity79 , which @entity2 designed in such a way that it 's difficult to disassemble for the sake of repairs , upgrades , and recycling , " wrote @entity74			0
@entity2 spokeswoman @entity86 issued a statement to @entity0 via e-mail : " @entity2 takes a comprehensive approach to measuring our environmental impact and all of our products meet the strictest energy efficiency standards backed by the @entity20 government , @entity94 5.2			2
we also lead the industry by reporting each product 's greenhouse gas emissions on our website , and @entity2 products are superior in other important environmental areas not measured by @entity8 , such as removal of toxic materials			1
" she declined to comment further			0
on its website , @entity2 says the @entity77 is recyclable ( @entity105 ) : " through ultra-efficient design and the use of highly recyclable materials , @entity2 has minimized material waste at the product 's end of life			2
in addition , @entity2 offers and participates in various product take - back and recycling programs in 95 % of the regions where @entity2 products are sold			2
" in a statement posted on its website last month , @entity8 did not elaborate on @entity2 's reasons for quitting the standard , which the company and other industry leaders helped create			1
" we regret that @entity2 will no longer be registering its products in @entity8			1
we hope that they will decide to do so again at some point in future , " the group says			0
@entity127 ranks @entity2 in the middle of the pack of tech companies -- behind @entity131 and @entity132 but ahead of @entity133 , @entity134 and others -- in terms of its sustainability and environmental friendliness			0
what do you think of the decision ? more important , will it affect whether you purchase @entity2 products ?			1
