@entity0 -- @entity3 's sanction - hit regime has long been accused of drug trafficking as a source of hard currency , but a new report claims drug producers are finding a ready market closer to home and that as many as two - thirds of @entity3 have used methamphetamines			1
according to a report in the spring 2013 edition of the journal @entity16 , stricter @entity18 border controls have forced methamphetamine producers in the north to seek a local market for " ice " ( known locally as " bingdu " )			1
the report 's co-author , professor @entity24 , of @entity27 's @entity26 , told the @entity28 that interviews with @entity16 defectors suggested that the country is in the grip of an " ice " plague			1
" some informants are saying almost every adult in @entity3 around the @entity18 - @entity3 border are using methamphetamine , " she said , adding that the drug was often used as a palliative in place of hard - to - obtain prescription medicine			1
" actually , the hospital medical system ( has ) stopped for such a long time , so they need something to cure their pain ... physical pain , " she said			0
" but once they get addicted to methamphetamine , there 's no way for them to get out of it			0
" the @entity16 regime releases no official figures on drug addiction and professor @entity24 said the scale of the problem could not be statistically verified			2
" but almost everybody in my interview is saying so , especially those who left @entity3 after 2009 , " she told the @entity28			2
she said that interviewees told her the drug could be ordered casually and easily in restaurants , and that it had become difficult to control since it had become the drug of choice of high - ranking officials and the police			1
while readily available , however , informants told her it was still expensive and did not indicate that @entity3 had a greater level of disposable income for recreational drug use			2
" using methamphetamine does not mean they have enough money to dispose ( of ) , " professor @entity24 said			0
" they had to get it with all the money they have			0
" @entity3 has been widely rumored to manufacture high - grade methamphetamine as a state policy for generating hard cash			0
estimates on how much @entity3 generates through illegal activities such as arms trades , drug sales and counterfeiting are speculative , but reports say @entity94 's shadowy " @entity93 " directs illicit trade that generates millions for the nation 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs .			0
