@entity1 , @entity0 -- the global health community has been battling tuberculosis for more than a century , yet the disease still thrives			1
@entity6 , which is contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs , spits or sneezes , strikes everywhere , but predominately affects the poor			2
the countries most affected by @entity6 are the so - called high - burden ones , or the 22 countries identified by the @entity15 that combined contribute 80 percent of the global burden of @entity6			1
many health care systems in these nations do n't have the resources , drugs and diagnostics to effectively deal with the disease , according to dr. @entity23 , director of research and development at the not - for - profit @entity26 ( @entity26 )			1
" but even if we upgraded those systems , the lack of a really effective vaccine , the lack of better and faster drugs that shorten treatment to a reasonable time and the lack of good drugs for treating resistant disease -- make it hard for any health care system to effectively deal with the disease , " he said			0
@entity6 is usually treated with a combination of antibiotics administered for six to 24 months			0
but many patients fail to finish the long course of treatment , which has led to the emergence of deadly strains of the disease that ca n't be wiped out by the usual drugs			1
there has n't been a new class of @entity6 drugs developed in 40 years , because it is mainly a disease of poverty , there has n't really been a commercial market for new drugs , @entity23 noted			1
however , growing awareness of the disease has led to greater emphasis being placed on finding new treatments			0
scientists at @entity64 recently developed a group of antibiotic compounds that could be strong enough to combat even drug - resistant strains of @entity6			2
the project is exciting but is still in an early phase , according to @entity23			0
he said it could be a good 10 years before a drug based on that research is available			0
" we 're going in the right direction , but unfortunately , the resources - given the magnitude of the problem - are still a small fraction of what is needed to have great chance of coming up with something that will turn the tide , " he said .			0

there has n't been a new class of @entity6 drugs developed in 40 years
