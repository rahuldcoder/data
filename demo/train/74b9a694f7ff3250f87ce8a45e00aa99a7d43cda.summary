@entity0 -- federal agents found much of the information produced by the @entity8 administration 's top - secret warrantless surveillance program vague and difficult to use , a sweeping review of the program found			1
former president @entity8 claims his administration 's surveillance program helped to ward off terrorist attacks			1
then - president @entity8 and other top administration officials have said the program was a critical tool in preventing terrorist attacks			1
however , a report friday by the inspectors general of the @entity19 , the @entity20 , the @entity21 and other agencies found that some @entity24 and @entity19 agents were frustrated by the secrecy surrounding the program			2
former @entity19 chiefs @entity27 and @entity28 told investigators the wiretaps filled a gap in @entity33 intelligence			0
one senior official quoted in the report called the wiretaps , dubbed the " @entity38 " by the report , " a key resource , " while the @entity24 considered it " one tool of many " in their efforts to head off terrorist plots , the report states			0
" even though most @entity38 leads were determined not to have any connection to terrorism , many of the @entity24 witnesses believed the mere possibility of the leads producing useful information made investigating the leads worthwhile , " the report states			0
the program was hugely controversial when @entity8 acknowledged its existence in 2005			1
critics said the program violated the @entity59 , a 1978 law passed to rein in the wiretapping abuses of the @entity63 era			0
@entity8 's approval allowed the @entity65 to intercept communications between people in the @entity33 and overseas who were suspected of having ties to terrorists without getting a court order			1
he and other officials said the program " prevented attacks and saved lives , " as vice president @entity75 put it in a may speech critical of their successors in the @entity81 administration			1
but friday 's report found that the intelligence gathered was only a small part of counterterrorism work , and most intelligence officials interviewed for the report had trouble " citing specific instances where @entity38 reporting had directly contributed to counterterrorism successes			2
" in addition , the @entity19 " did not implement procedures to assess the usefulness of the product of the @entity38 , and did not routinely document whether particular @entity38 reporting had contributed to successful counterterrorism operations , " the report states			0
at another point , it noted that some @entity24 agents " criticized the @entity38 - derived information they received for providing insufficient details , and the agents who managed counterterrorism programs at the @entity24 field offices the @entity106 visited said the @entity24 's process for disseminating @entity38 - derived information failed to adequately prioritize the information for investigation			2
meanwhile , @entity19 officers were unable to make " full use " of the data because too few people had been briefed on the closely held program			0
" according to one @entity19 manager , the tight control over access to the @entity38 prevented some officers who could have made effective use of the program reporting from being read in , " the report states			0
the report also confirmed that the @entity38 was not limited to the electronic intercepts , referring repeatedly to " other intelligence activities " that remain classified			0
the report concluded the program was built on a " factually flawed " legal analysis inappropriately provided by a single @entity20 official , @entity130 , in 2001			1
@entity130 did not immediately respond to a @entity1 request for comment , and he was not interviewed for the report			0
a 2004 review by the @entity20 triggered a dramatic confrontation in 2004 between @entity137 and @entity20 officials who concluded the program would not pass legal muster			1
former deputy attorney general @entity140 , who took part in that face - off , told investigators that the program 's original authorization " involved ignoring an act of @entity145 , and doing so without full congressional notification			1
" that line drew the ire of house speaker @entity151 , who issued a statement friday declaring that " no president should be able to operate outside the law			0
" " @entity157 will closely examine the findings and recommendations of the classified and unclassified reports , and will conduct appropriate oversight of electronic surveillance activities , " the @entity156 @entity155 said			0
sen. @entity163 , a @entity164 @entity155 who sits on the @entity165 , said the report " highlights just how outrageous and damaging the illegal warrantless wiretapping program really was			2
" " this report leaves no doubt that the warrantless wiretapping program was blatantly illegal and an unconstitutional assertion of executive power , " @entity163 said			2
" i once again call on the @entity81 administration and its @entity20 to withdraw the flawed legal memoranda that justified the program and that remain in effect today			1

audit : info from @entity8 's surveillance program found to be vague
program allowed for top - secret , warrantless wiretaps
@entity8 , other former administration officials have *touted* program 's success
@entity189 concluded program was built on " factually flawed " legal analysis
