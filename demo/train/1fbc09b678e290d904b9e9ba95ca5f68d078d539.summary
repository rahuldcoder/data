-- investigators are leaning in the direction that the same person or persons who crafted the @entity8 underwear bomb were behind the @entity10 - based devices hidden in packages sent from @entity12 , a @entity2 government official told @entity0			1
" the thinking is it 's the same person or group of people that built the underwear bomb because of the way it 's put together , " said the official , who had been briefed by multiple @entity2 authorities and law enforcement sources			1
" but this one is about four times as powerful			2
" @entity2 authorities are now endorsing @entity29 prime minister @entity28 's position that the explosives were designed to take down an airplane , the official said			2
one package was found in @entity33 in the @entity34			1
the other was discovered at an airport in @entity37			2
on friday , @entity2 officials said they had not taken a position on whether planes or two @entity41 , @entity42 , synagogues were the ultimate targets			2
the packages had the synagogue addresses			2
meanwhile , a woman believed to be connected to a plot to send explosive packages bound for the @entity2 has been arrested in the @entity12 capital of @entity51 , according to a @entity12 government official and a reporter with the state news agency			1
a female relative of the woman was also being questioned by @entity12 authorities , the government official said			1
the relationship between the two women was not immediately known			2
authorities are looking at a specific material found in the devices and used in the foiled " underwear bomb " attempt in 2009			1
a source close to the investigation said the type of material found in the devices was @entity10 , a highly explosive organic compound belonging to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin			2
six grams of @entity10 are enough to blow a hole in the fuselage of an aircraft			0
@entity10 was allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by @entity79 , the @entity80 man accused of trying to set off a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard a @entity84 flight as it approached @entity85 , @entity86 , on december 25			1
@entity79 is alleged to have been carrying 80 grams of @entity10 in that botched attack			0
" the quantity of @entity10 in these [ new ] devices was about five times the volume used at @entity8 " by @entity79 , col. @entity92 , the former chairman of the @entity29 government 's @entity93 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity88			1
the plot " does appear to be a typical @entity97 - type operation , " he said			1
a source closely involved in the investigation said the detonating substance was lead @entity102			0
@entity102 is a " very powerful initiator " which is easily prepared and is a standard substance in detonations , the source said			0
believing that a @entity12 affiliate of @entity97 was involved , @entity2 and @entity29 authorities said explosive devices jammed into ink toner cartridges were powerful enough to bring down a large aircraft			1
@entity29 authorities said they believe @entity113 in central @entity37 was simply a conduit for shipment of one device to the @entity2			0
" we believe that the device was designed to go off on the airplane , " @entity28 said			0
" we can not be sure about the timing when that was meant to take place			0
there is no early evidence that that was meant to take place over @entity29 soil , but of course we can not rule it out			0
" @entity29 home secretary @entity126 said authorities do not believe the perpetrators would have known the location of the device had they detonated it			0
as they studied the devices and toiled to understand the extent of the plot , authorities pointed their fingers at @entity136			2
the group is based in @entity12 , a poor @entity138 nation that has emerged as a major operating base for @entity97 and other terror groups			1
secretary of homeland security @entity141 told @entity0 on saturday that the plan to send the explosives has the " hallmarks of @entity97 , the @entity136 -- they are constantly trying things to test our system			1
" @entity12 has asked for outside help to thwart terror groups , but the country , the ancestral home of @entity153 , is still used for operations , @entity2 officials say			1
the failed " @entity79 " plot , for example , is believed to be the workings of @entity136			0
and in january , the @entity2 and @entity29 temporarily closed their embassies in @entity12 's capital , @entity51 , because of terror concerns			1
@entity2 authorities were grateful for a tip from @entity12 's oil - rich neighbor , @entity167 , alerting them to the suspicious packages			1
the @entity167 government provided @entity2 officials with tracking numbers of the two packages , enabling quick tracing to the @entity29 and @entity33 , a source told @entity0			1
president @entity176 called @entity177 on saturday to thank him , the @entity175 said			0
on friday , @entity176 confirmed the two devices contained explosive material and were bound for two " places of @entity182 worship " in @entity41 , @entity42			2

@entity176 's presidential counterterrorism advisor , @entity190 , spoke to @entity12 president @entity191 , stressing " the importance of close counterterrorism cooperation , including the need to work together on the ongoing investigation into the events over the past few days , " according to the @entity175			1
@entity191 told reporters that @entity12 could not confirm the packages contained explosives , but he acknowledged the nation 's economy and tourism industry have suffered because of @entity97 's presence			1
he vowed to fight the terror group			0
" we do want anyone to interfere in @entity12 affairs and start chasing @entity97 , " @entity191 said			1
" we will chase @entity97 with our airplanes and our equipment			1
we will chase @entity97 wherever they are			1
" over the past several months , @entity12 , which wants to be seen as a committed partner in the fight against terrorism , has asked for assistance from other countries			1
@entity191 's appearance before reporters a day after friday 's developments is considered significant			0
authorities , meanwhile , said the explosive devices were meticulously crafted			2
they were " professionally " loaded and connected using an electric circuit to a mobile phone chip tucked in a printer , @entity33 police told @entity224 , the official news agency for the @entity34			1
the devices were packed in toner cartridges and designed to be detonated by a cell phone , a source close to the investigation told @entity0			2
the package found at @entity113 contained a " manipulated " toner cartridge and had white powder on it as well as wires and a circuit board , a law enforcement source said friday			0
a similar package set to be shipped on a @entity241 cargo plane was discovered in @entity33 , officials there said			1
when the @entity167 warned @entity243 law enforcement that there were explosives inside the cartridge at @entity113 , the @entity29 -- using human and canines -- could not detect the material , according to a @entity2 law enforcement official familiar with investigation			2
the @entity29 authorities contacted the @entity167 to verify the tip , the official said			0
the @entity167 told them to inspect the cartridge again , and that is when the @entity29 authorities discovered the material , the official said			0
in response to the threat , authorities stepped up searches friday of cargo planes and trucks in several @entity2 cities , said law enforcement sources with detailed knowledge of the investigation			0
also friday , the @entity270 stopped all packages originating from @entity12 , and shipping companies @entity273 , @entity241 and @entity274 all said they were complying with the order			1

they 're not expecting to find anything else			0
" officials are checking on packages sent from @entity12 over the past several weeks , @entity281 said			2
as authorities pressed forward in the investigation saturday and strengthened security , a leader of a small @entity295 - friendly synagogue in @entity41 , @entity42 , said her place of worship was one of the targets of the intercepted packages			0
" it was unnerving , but we carried on as normal , " @entity301 , co-president of @entity302 , said of friday night 's services			0
the @entity307 in @entity41 would not confirm whether @entity302 was targeted , spokesman @entity306 said			0
