@entity0 -- under fire about disclosures of broad @entity5 snooping on global leaders , president @entity2 is offering a two - pronged response : you do it , too , and we 'll make some changes			1
thousands of documents leaked by former @entity5 contractor @entity13 have portrayed the vast reach of @entity17 surveillance activities , keeping tabs not only on @entity17 call data but also global @entity20 and e-mail traffic			1
@entity22 to send intelligence officers to @entity17 but @entity13 's @entity5 documents , published recently in the @entity26 , @entity27 and other publications , also describe spying on foreign leaders and that has now complicated @entity17 diplomacy , the @entity2 administration acknowledges			1

we want to ensure we are collecting information because we need it and not just because we can			0
" it 's not clear what changes will come from the review and even if they 'll be made public			1
these programs are , after all , secret			0
or they were before the @entity13 disclosures			0
@entity17 ambassadors in @entity51 and @entity52 have been summoned by host countries to be scolded about the spying revelations			1
on friday , @entity51 leaders ended an @entity57 summit in @entity58 with a stern warning to the @entity17 about the spying activities : " a lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation			1
" the @entity57 leaders did n't mention curtailing any spying activities directed at the @entity17 or elsewhere			2
among the leaders in the @entity51 response is @entity68 , the @entity69 leader who is in talks to form a coalition government following elections			2
@entity68 called @entity2 and raised the sensitivities of @entity69 related to government spying , because of the activities of the @entity22 's @entity76			2
@entity78 spokesman @entity77 told reporters that the @entity17 understands the sensitivities but defended the activities			2
" there are real threats out there against the @entity52 people and against our allies , including @entity22 , including allies around @entity51 and around the world , " he said			1
the spying activity is part of what 's expected around the world , @entity17 and foreign officials say			1
for years , @entity17 government officials have been required to leave behind their laptops and phones when they travel to @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , @entity17 officials say			1
to thwart expected spying they bring specially formatted devices , the officials say			0
a former senior @entity17 counterintelligence official says the @entity17 contends with economic spying from allies , including @entity106 , @entity100 and @entity107			1
@entity98 and @entity99 remain the top countries with spying operations in the @entity17			2
in the 1990s , former @entity106 spy chief @entity110 acknowledged the activity			0
in a @entity17 diplomatic cable obtained by @entity113 and published in the @entity115 newspaper @entity114 , @entity116 , an official with the @entity69 satellite company @entity117 , is quoted as saying : " @entity106 is the evil empire ( in ) stealing technology , and @entity22 knows this			2
" @entity106 was among the countries who summoned its @entity17 ambassador to protest the reported @entity5 activities			1
former @entity128 president @entity127 , speaking to spanish - language media during a visit this week , expressed surprise that his country 's current president , @entity130 , had protested spying by the @entity5			0

he said he knew as president that he was being spied on by the @entity17			2
but he also recalled that @entity128 spies had him under surveillance when he was running for president in 2000			0
one @entity52 ambassador told @entity1 this week that he was n't surprised at the reported @entity5 snooping activities , because all governments spy			1
but he was astonished at the scale , which he attributes to the money and technical abilities of the @entity17			0
" they do it because they can , " the ambassador says			0
" my country does n't do it because we do n't have that kind of money and we do n't have the technology			0
" @entity162 , a former senior @entity17 homeland security official in the @entity164 administration , says the outrage in @entity51 appears to ignore the scale of hacking from @entity98 , most of it believed to be state - sponsored			1
" the difference is the @entity98 have never leaked documents , " he said			0
he also noted that protests by @entity68 now are different from 2007 when the @entity69 leader traveled to @entity98 shortly after revelations that @entity98 hackers had infiltrated @entity69 computer networks			0
