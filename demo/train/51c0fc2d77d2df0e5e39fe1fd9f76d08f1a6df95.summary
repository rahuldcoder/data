@entity0 -- i 'm a @entity6 , but no poster child for the @entity6 community			1
i am critical of the difference between words and actions in our religion 's promised equality for women			1
but like most @entity6 i do still believe in one god , karma and reincarnation , and i find the poetry of our 10 gurus deeply inspiring			1
nevertheless , on a postcard - perfect sunday morning five days ago when my local gurdwara , or house of worship , was attacked by an apparent white supremacist , i was very much a @entity6 , doing whatever i could			1
after the shooting , my @entity28 - @entity27 husband @entity26 and i rushed to @entity30 and joined the group of @entity6 men and women standing in the parking lot of a bowling alley across a boulevard from police vehicles surrounding the temple			1
we held hands , offered presence and solidarity			2
only three commandments are given to @entity6 : work hard , share with your neighbors , take the name of the lord			1
only the last two were possible on that day			2
yellow tape cordoned us off			2
my fellow @entity6 were dressed in sunday best -- a mix of business suits and white kurta pajamas among the men , salwar kameezes for the older women			1
i noticed that many men of working age have short hair and no longer wear turbans			2
since the shooting of a @entity6 in @entity62 in 2001 , recorded hate crimes against @entity6 have decreased			1
however , young @entity6 men heard over the gurdwara grapevine that if you want to wear your turban , emigrate to @entity67			1
@entity67 has had an official policy of multiculturalism since 1971			2
news : @entity72 shooting dredges up memories of long history of bias crimes against sikhs on sunday , as we waited for those trapped inside the gurdwara , a kind soul from the @entity81 came around suggesting trauma counseling			1
anger and frustration , he said , can surface later			0
a middle - aged man in the crowd came forward and thanked him in @entity88			0
in @entity91 , he added , " the shooter needs counseling if he survives			0
he should be invited to do sewa			0
" @entity94 is community service			1
it has been used to bring about restorative justice in @entity67 , by familiarizing perps with @entity6 and @entity99			1
a young man wearing a " @entity101 " t - shirt looked up from his @entity104 feed			0
" they 're saying we 're an obscure religion			1
how can 23 million people be obscure ? " i thought of my turbaned father guiding tourists around the state @entity111 in @entity113 as a @entity115 student working for gov. @entity116 , teaching @entity27 their history			0
@entity99 may have been " obscure " in the 1950s , but -- now ? we have @entity118 , we have @entity119 , we have @entity120 , we have @entity121			0
but those who hate do n't read about those they blame for their status shock or economic troubles			1
" we offer langar every sunday , " said a woman , referring to the free dining hall open to the public			0
" but even homeless goras do n't come			2
" a little boy asked of the suspect : " wo n't his mother be ashamed of him ? wo n't his whole family be ashamed of him ? " " do n't be silly , " his sister said			2
" he 's a gora			0
" " maybe this will make some @entity146 politicians talk about gun control , " said a young woman wearing capri pants , a bright orange crocheted top and a chunni over her head			0
" do n't be silly , " her uncle said			2
news : @entity6 repair , reclaim temple after rampage i said , " i should have made more fliers , led tours of the gurdwaras			1
" but in 25 years married into a @entity159 - @entity27 family , the only relative who has volunteered to attend gurdwara with me is my husband			0
could i have persuaded strangers ? " whenever we invite goras , we get evangelicals who want to convert us , " said an elder i 've called " aunty " for years			0
" i tell them your god is my god			0
" " any time i explain we 're not @entity172 , it sounds like we would prefer them to harass @entity172 , " said the man in the ' @entity101 ' t - shirt			0
" just better say nothing			0
most sikhs do n't look for jobs , we make them			2
we gather together for worship on sundays because we live in a @entity180 - @entity179 country , but most of us do our remembrance of god every day			0
we do n't have a sabbath ; most of us work all the time			2
we wear the kirpan ( ceremonial dagger ) to remind us to defend those who can not defend themselves			0
we 're supposed to look different so that we can not blend into crowds and evade responsibility			1
we 're @entity6 , so we 're supposed to inspire by courage and never teach fear			1
our very name means we 're supposed to always be learning			2
we 're taught not to ask for favors , but to thank @entity194 , the highest teacher , for grace , for our critical faculties , intuition and creativity			0
news : @entity200 says @entity6 showed love in response to hate today i will dress in white , the color of mourning , to attend the funerals of the six @entity6 who were killed and offer support for their families			1
afterward , i 'll go to the gurdwara that 200 @entity6 cleaned yesterday as our sewa			1
there i 'll join in prayers for the departed and for the three men wounded and still in the hospital			0
the gathering will end as always with prayers for " sarbat da bhala " -- the progress of all humankind			0
i know that by the grace of the creative force and our courage , @entity27 sikhs will survive this act of destruction			1
an ignorant man showed his country and the world what fear and hate can bring about			0
may we now show what love and service can achieve			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			1

@entity234 says she went to be with fellow @entity6 at @entity30 after shooting
she says survivors , others stood outside puzzling over how their religion is still *misunderstood*
@entity6 value learning , aim to look different so they ca n't blend in or evade responsibility
@entity234 : @entity6 community will take care of own , survive act of ignorance , hatred , destruction
