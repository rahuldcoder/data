-- the paint is peeling , puddles litter the inside of the building , putrid water lies in what was supposed to be a swimming pool and even the statue of the man who had the vision to build the sports complex is cracked -- a sad and inglorious tribute to @entity13 10 years to the day after the @entity15 's tragic death			1
once earmarked as a state - of - the - art $ 10 million sports academy , the only inhabitants today are not the next generation of @entity20 but a handful of squatters and policemen -- with @entity13 's father funding the latter because of the high risk of theft in this corner of @entity29			1
those are not @entity31 's only financial concerns because his bitter row with @entity13 's widow @entity33 over the distribution of the estate of the two - time @entity38 champion , double @entity40 league winner and former @entity42 star lies at the heart of the complex 's decline			1
with @entity31 claiming that @entity13 's properties should be returned to his side of the family and the star 's wife -- neither relative would speak directly to @entity0 -- believing she should be the recipient , the duo are at such loggerheads that a resolution seems incredibly remote			2
it 's a dispute made all the more tragic given the former international 's body lies in the all - but - abandoned complex			0
shortly after the midfielder died of cardiac arrest during a @entity61 semi-final on 26 june 2003 , @entity15 's government pledged funds to ensure completion of a project started by a man who was posthumously decorated as a commander of the @entity68 of @entity69			1
the country 's then prime minister laid the medal on top of @entity13 's coffin as some 3,000 mourners - including further government dignitaries , @entity78 president @entity77 and @entity15 's football squad -- gathered at the four - hectare site			1
but because of the intense familial row -- while a government promise of funds also failed to materialize -- the real legacy of @entity13 's death is not to be found in a suburb of @entity15 's capital but in the world 's international football stadiums instead			1
" @entity13 's death really shook @entity78 and what changed was the attitude of the @entity94 and other decision - makers towards medicine and the health of the players , " professor @entity90 , @entity78 's chief medical officer , told @entity0 from @entity91			1
" there were already medical courses in place and we were aware of the issue of cardiac arrest , but that was the extent of what we were doing			2
but once we experienced it live , in front of rolling tv cameras , we realized the reality of the situation and understood we had to do more			0
" it made me certain that prevention was the way to go and so many , many new regulations have been implemented since then to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death on the pitch			0
" medical screening football 's world governing has acted steadily over the years to try to ensure that there are as few repeats as possible of the awful scenes that were broadcast to millions around the world from @entity127 a decade ago			0
the @entity40 city was , ironically , the very one where @entity13 's registration was kept although @entity132 side @entity131 had been keen to sign the tall @entity15 -- who had been with them on loan the preceding year -- on a permanent basis			1
they would never get the chance as the then 28 - year - old collapsed in the 72nd minute of the semifinal against @entity141 with no - one around him			0
an opponent was the first to notice the seriousness of the situation and unlike the swift treatment given to @entity149 ' @entity148 at @entity150 last year , medical assistance was slow to arrive			0
despite attempts to resuscitate him for 45 minutes and the fact that he was still alive when taken to the ground 's medical center , @entity13 died because of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy -- a condition that involves an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle			2
those who are prone to the problem are up to five times more likely to suffer a cardiac arrest when exercising intensively than they would be when leading a sedentary lifestyle			2
as the tributes flooded in for a talented player with terrific stamina and , according to those who knew him , a permanent smile on his face , @entity78 reacted by making it mandatory to equip all stadiums hosting international matches with automated external defibrillators			0
in addition , the organization introduced medical screenings of all players ahead of any @entity78 competition -- a policy which was of clear benefit to all the recipients , but especially those from @entity13 's continent			1
at the @entity186 in @entity187 , @entity78 -- in conjunction with the continental body @entity189 and the local @entity190 -- medically assessed all 160 players and unwittingly discovered that nearly 70 % of the teenagers had never seen a doctor before in their lives			0
late last month , @entity78 issued all of its 209 member associations a @entity198 , one which the global body says is similar to those in use by the @entity203 and @entity38 military and which , more importantly , boasts a defibrillator among its contents			1
however , @entity90 readily concedes that the bag will be largely worthless unless the training of teams ' medical personnel is up to scratch			0
" it is important that the doctors and paramedics are adequately educated to be able to use it in case of emergency , but we can never guarantee that the right training is being done all around the world , " said the @entity210			0
" definitely at those competitions where we are responsible , like the @entity61 here in @entity91 , we check that the relevant people are able to understand what they have in their hands -- and how important it is that they know			0
" all the more so since the first symptom of those suffering hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can sometimes be death itself , while footballers to have died of cardiac issues in recent years form a depressingly long list -- with the cases of @entity235 ( @entity236 ) , @entity237 ( @entity238 ) and @entity239 ( @entity240 ) prominent among them			0
while the medical measures undertaken by @entity78 form part of @entity13 's legacy , a final chapter continues to play out wherever @entity15 's @entity20 roam			1
irreplaceable midfielder the first team from @entity247 to reach the @entity249 quarterfinals ( in 1990 ) , @entity15 were feared at the time of @entity13 's death -- with the team having added the 2002 @entity253 to their 2000 title as they became the first to win back - to - back crowns in nearly four decades			1
since the death of a central midfielder who has simply proved irreplaceable in the middle -- a box - to - box player with aerial presence and a calming , disciplined demeanor -- @entity15 's footballing fortunes have steadily declined			2
they have not won a match at the @entity249 since @entity13 's death ( missing out on @entity265 2006 altogether ) nor another @entity38 title -- and political rows and team squabbling have meant the four - time continental champions have failed to qualify for the last two @entity270			1
the last month has been indicative of the country 's recent woes , with @entity249 qualification having hung by a thread until opponents @entity275 -- who beat @entity15 earlier this month -- were found to have fielded an ineligible player during the qualifier , meaning the @entity20 may be awarded some fortuitous points instead			0
at the same time , the football federation chose to re-elect @entity282 as president -- despite the fact he was being detained by local police at the time after being accused of transgressions connected to his role as director - general of the state - owned @entity291			0
a once proud game is , in short , something of a mess -- and perhaps the crumbling complex where the patriotic @entity13 lies is a fitting , if sad , reflection of the lamentable state of @entity15 football today .			2
