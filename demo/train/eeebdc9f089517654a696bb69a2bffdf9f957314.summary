-- @entity1 is a hard man to pin down			0
when we spoke earlier this month , he had just arrived in @entity3 from @entity4 , a few days after returning to @entity5 from @entity6 and just before heading to @entity7 to put together a photography exhibition in the @entity10 capital			0
" it 's been a long time since i spent three months in one place , " said the celebrated 33 - year - old @entity5 photographer , whose work has been exhibited in art festivals across the world			2
" i believe so much in movement -- movement in the physical sense , movement in the metaphysical sense , so i am always moving ; this is basically who i am			0
" describing himself as a " border being " who is always in motion , award - winning @entity27 works and lives between @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity3			0
but his constant need for movement is most clearly manifested through @entity32 , an artist - led project he co-founded in 2009 with the aim of finding new ways of portraying the complexities of life in contemporary @entity39			1
read this : glorious colors in the desert once a year , the project brings together a troupe of about a dozen @entity39 artists and photographers to brave tough terrains , adverse weather and brusque border officials as they embark on a road trip across parts of the continent			1
traveling for several weeks inside a crammed minivan , the intrepid participants use photography and art to capture the stories of the people they encounter , encourage cultural exploration and cut through geographical divides			0
" we 're talking about trans - @entity39 exchange , " explains @entity27			1
" transcending those limitations and those pre-definitions that exist about the continent , " he adds			2
" what we 're saying is that as artists we 're not road builders ; we do n't build roads but we may as well build a trans - african highway of the mind			1
" the first " @entity79 " was competed four years ago when the team traveled from @entity3 to @entity73 , the capital of @entity74 , and one year later they headed further west , all the way to @entity77 , @entity78			1
for the third edition , in 2011 , the group journeyed eastwards , passing through @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity82 to reach the @entity84 capital of @entity85			2
last year , @entity32 planned to travel from @entity3 to @entity86 in @entity87 but the trip was cut short after suffering a number of setbacks			1
" rather than continue and hurrying through places to @entity87 , we decided to spend more days in @entity93 and @entity94 , " explains @entity27			0
" we thought we would get more out of the road trip that way ; besides , it is not really about the destination but the journey itself			1
" read this : photos show @entity87 in new light four years into the project , the experience has been both demanding and thrilling , intense and inspiring			0
the group 's refusal to pay any bribes often results in hours of waiting at border crossings			2
when not stuck at customs , there is the problem of the elements ; last year , the tenacious artists spent four days stuck in the mud , pushing and digging all the way through the sinking soil to make it out of a neglected road near the @entity93 and @entity5 border			1
and then there 's the risk of upsetting authorities ; in 2011 , the artists were arrested in @entity6 's capital @entity126 for eight hours after taking photos in one of the city 's markets but it 's not all about ordeals			2
the journeys are also full of high points			0
" one of the times that was very inspiring and very surprising was our getting into @entity138 , " said @entity27			0
he admits that the prospect of visiting the @entity82 capital had made the team nervous , because of the images of conflict that have shaped the narrative around @entity82 in recent years			2
" @entity82 is not a place people just wake up one morning and try to go to -- it is the place you hear in the news , " said @entity27			0
" but when we got into @entity138 it was just amazing , " he recalls			0
" everybody was just so welcoming and lovely ; it had nothing to do with the war you 'd heard in the news			0
that made us think that we have to keep doing this project even 50 years from now because there is a whole lot to know about our continent and about our neighbors			0
" read this : @entity39 's magnificent views throughout its journeys , the team makes several stops in major cities to join forces with local artists , conduct workshops and exchange ideas			1
as an extension of the road trip , @entity32 members also often return to the cities they 've visited to exhibit the work they created whilst passing through there			1
the goal , @entity27 said , is to engage with young minds and create a network of people that will push forward broader discussions about 21st century @entity39			1
" everywhere we go to there is a lot of optimism , especially from the young people , " said @entity27			0
" a lot of people are waiting to be inspired ; a lot of people are waiting to find something to get into , " he adds			0
" and this is what is beautiful now about @entity39 -- when people see something like this , they immediately imagine themselves being able to do it as well			1
" for its next journey in 2014 , the team has set its most ambitious goal to date : completing its first intercontinental road trip , from @entity3 to @entity208 , @entity209			1
" the reason why we 're making this is because we believe that part of @entity32 and trans - @entity213 is to be proactive , " said @entity27			2
" we think that now it 's a good time to address the relationship between @entity39 and @entity218 and talk about it , " he adds			2
" to make a road trip toward there and sort of try to touch that line between @entity39 and @entity218			1

every year a group of @entity39 photographers , artists , takes road trip
" @entity32 " group aims to find new narratives about the continent
so far , the team has held four road trips , exploring different parts of @entity39
it aims to complete its first *inter-continental* journey next year by reaching @entity208
