@entity0 -- throngs of jubilant @entity3 , some so happy they wept , gathered early tuesday at @entity0 's @entity4 for the country 's first international soccer match in years			1
" i can not believe my eyes , " exclaimed @entity7 , 19			0
he wept and shouted " @entity9 ! " or " @entity10 is great ! " " i have not seen in my entire life that many @entity3 gathered in one location happy , dancing and chanting , " he said			1
" i am not used to it			0
... it 's my happiest moment ! " a decade after the @entity16 began , @entity15 felt something he had n't in a long time in this country with tenuous peace -- optimism			1
" i have been waiting for this moment , " he said			0
" it is time for @entity3 to live together peacefully			1
let 's live together peacefully like we are doing now from inside this stadium			0
i look around me , and i see @entity3 from different sects shouting ... ' yes ! yes for @entity3 ! ' " it was the first international soccer match in @entity0 since @entity3 's 4 - 0 victory over the @entity31 team during a friendly game in july 2009 -- and the first home game inside @entity3 since the international soccer governing association , @entity34 , lifted a ban last week			1
under that ban , @entity3 was forbidden from hosting home games after security and technical issues emerged from its loss to @entity42 's team in the northern @entity3 city of @entity44 in september 2011			1
because tuesday 's game was " friendly , " the @entity45 got to choose their opponent			1
" i do n't see why we should not play with @entity49 in a friendly game , " said @entity3 fan @entity50			1
" @entity49 is our neighbor , and they need our support			2
" @entity49 opened its borders to all @entity3 over the past years , " he said			1
" it 's time for us to pay it back to them and show our support to @entity49 people			1
" choosing to play @entity49 seemed amusing to one @entity3 fan			1
" i do n't know why we started our friendly game with @entity49 , " @entity63 said , laughing			2
" i believe @entity3 should have started to play a friendly game with a country that does not have internal problems			1
it would be much more solid start for @entity3			2
" " do n't get me wrong , " he continued			0
" i am not against it at all or against @entity49 people , but this could be a good propaganda for @entity75 regime			2
" there did n't appear to be any @entity49 fans waving flags or holding signs with any political message at tuesday 's match			1
for two years , @entity49 has been locked in a civil war pitting the regime of president @entity75 against rebels who are trying to oust him			1
the rebels and human rights organizations say @entity75 's forces have committed war crimes ; @entity75 claims the violence in @entity49 is the work of terrorists			1
the @entity93 says the war has claimed 70,000 lives			0
it 's highly unlikely @entity3 chose to play @entity49 for political reasons , said @entity1 contributor @entity98 , who wrote the book " when friday comes , " a rollicking first - person adventure through the intersection of religion , war , politics and soccer in the @entity107			1
@entity3 needed to choose a team that was nearby , and schedules seemed to align for both teams , he said			2
" and you 're not going to ask a marquee team to come to @entity0 , " @entity98 said			2
they might not be @entity114 , but the @entity49 national soccer team is nothing to sniff at			1
the team has been enjoying a bang - up year , @entity98 said			0
they almost qualified for the @entity120 in @entity121 , and they made the quarterfinals of a major youth tournament last year			0
despite the irony of their team 's success amid the backdrop of their country 's bitter civil war , the players have avoided discussing the situation in @entity49 , said @entity98 , who reported for the @entity133 on @entity49 's @entity135 qualifying match in @entity42			1
" there were a lot of interpreters with the squad who seemed to deflect questions , but i have no idea if they were with the [ @entity49 ] regime , " he said			2
" we 'll probably never now what 's going on behind the scenes until after the war			2
" while @entity49 descends deeper into conflict , @entity3 is slowly recovering after a decade of war that divided the country along sectarian lines			1
on tuesday , inside and outside @entity0 's @entity4 , @entity3 of all ages and backgrounds agreed on one thing -- their " @entity156 " were going to win			1
six minutes into the second half , the @entity3 scored			2
captain @entity158 , nicknamed " @entity159 , " drove the ball into the net			0
the @entity156 would take it , 2 - 1			0
@entity158 , who sports a tattoo of @entity3 on his arm , is beloved in his home country			2
he scored the winning goal in the @entity168 's @entity167 when the @entity156 beat @entity169 1 - 0 in a stunning victory that became a national point of pride			0
@entity158 's war story is also famous , @entity98 notes , having moved to @entity174 to be with his family despite that he could have easily taken offers from various @entity178 teams to join them			0
many of @entity158 's teammates went through hell , some telling of torture by @entity183 's son @entity182 when they did n't perform well on the field			0
and then there 's the specter of violence tied to matches past			0
during the semifinal of the 2007 @entity195 win , two car bombs went off in @entity0 killing scores of people			0
" the match today is a sign that things are improving , " said @entity98			0
" it 's also a huge test for the government			0
but for @entity3 , football is everything			0
the return of football is a return to normality			0
" @entity1 's @entity209 contributed to this report .			0

first international soccer match in @entity0 in years brings @entity3 to tears
" it 's my happiest moment ! " an @entity3 fan exclaims
@entity45 chose to play @entity49 , who are caught up in civil war
