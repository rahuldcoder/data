@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 judge ruled friday that @entity4 must serve one year of supervised probation for a check - fraud conviction , saying that failing to carry through on a " lawfully imposed sentence " would be a " mockery of justice			1
" @entity11 chief judge @entity10 said that @entity12 has to report to a state @entity15 facility in @entity0 no later than noon on august 26 , though she can report earlier			1
@entity10 also ruled the @entity15 can keep @entity12 's address confidential to safeguard her well - being			1
citing reports indicating @entity12 is highly disliked by the public , the judge acknowledged that there " is a high probability that there are many that would like to ... physical ( ly ) harm " the defendant			1
the probation order states that @entity12 can not leave " the county of ( her ) residence " -- which has been @entity11 -- without her probation officer 's approval			1
@entity35 , spokeswoman for the corrections department , said friday that her agency is reviewing the order			0
" we will then determine what is the best way to implement it , " said @entity35			0
" miss @entity41 has not received permission to move to another state			0
" @entity12 was cleared last month of murder charges related to the death of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity4			1
the same @entity1 jury did convict her on four lesser charges , related to misleading law enforcement authorities			0
her probation stems , though , from an earlier conviction -- in january 2010 -- on felony check fraud charges after she admitted stealing a checkbook from her friend @entity55 and writing five checks totaling $ 644.25			1
the probation order specifies that @entity12 have " no personal contact with the victim , @entity59			2
" in the judgment released friday , judge @entity61 -- as quoted in a court transcript from january 2010 -- ordered @entity12 to serve " a year of supervised probation , once released			1
" but the order signed by @entity61 at the time indicated it would run while she was in state custody awaiting trial on murder charges related to her daughter 's death			1
@entity72 , spokesman for the @entity11 state attorney 's office , said the court clerk had misunderstood @entity61 and written the court order based on the misunderstanding			0
the documents were amended august 1 to add the words " upon release " to @entity12 's sentencing documents , according to the @entity81			2
@entity12 's defense team responded with a motion saying she can not serve probation again when she has already served it behind bars , claiming that would violate the double jeopardy clause in the @entity88			1
the motion , filed by attorney @entity90 , calls the amended documents " a fraudulently filed product of a previously disqualified judge			0
" @entity61 had been presiding over @entity12 's murder case until april 2010 , when he recused himself after the defense accused him of being a " self - aggrandizing media hound " who was biased against her			1
@entity10 took over and stayed in that position throughout the trial			2
in the motion , @entity90 notes that @entity61 , in an appearance on @entity104 's " @entity103 , " expressed " shock " about @entity12 's acquittal , and criticized the jury 's verdicts in an appearance on @entity2 affiliate @entity108			1
" such unbridled prejudice by a sitting judge calls into question the validity of any rulings made after recusal , " @entity90 wrote			0
@entity61 recused himself from the probation matter the next day , transferring it to @entity10			2
in his ruling , @entity10 wrote , " it is clear the court stated the defendant 's probation was to start once she was released from jail " -- even if that was n't reflected in documents due to a " clerical error			2
" the judge cited precedent to correct such documents , saying " an order is rendered , valid and binding when orally given			0
" the judge added instituting the probation does n't violate rules against double jeopardy , since the check fraud crimes that @entity12 was convicted of and those she was acquitted of are distinct			1
he also said @entity12 could n't have complied with the probation terms while in jail			2
" to bar the court from correcting a clerical mistake and to permit the defendant to serve probation in jail while awaiting trial on a totally unrelated charge without any possibility of complying with the terms of the probation order would clearly thwart society 's interest in extracting a full , fair and just punishment for a crime , " said @entity10			2
under the terms of her probation , @entity12 must check in with the probation office -- which is in @entity11 , the same @entity1 county where she 's lived and the crime occurred -- once a month and answer all questions			1
she can not change her job or her residence unless such a move is approved by her probation officer			0
in addition to an order that she can not violate " any law , " @entity12 is barred from drinking alcoholic beverages to the extent they impair her " normal faculties			0
" she must undergo regular breath , urine and blood tests to assess how much alcohol and controlled substances are in her body			0
there are also prohibitions on her visiting places where drugs , alcohol and " other dangerous substances " are unlawfully sold or used			0
