@entity0 's and @entity1 dropped an egg supplier this week after an activist group released disturbing video showing what it says shows animal cruelty at three of the company 's barns			1
the undercover video , released by @entity11 , was allegedly shot between may and august at facilities run by @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
it shows hens crammed in crowded cages , workers burning beaks and one , trying to shove a bird inside the pocket of a co-worker , apparently for fun			0
another worker presses his thumb against the back of a chick 's neck until it breaks			0
" regarding the undercover videos , the behavior on tape is disturbing and completely unacceptable			2
@entity0 's wants to assure our customers that we demand humane treatment of animals by our suppliers			0
we take this responsibility -- along with our customers ' trust -- very seriously			0
it 's important to note that the most alarming actions on video did not occur at @entity13 's @entity45 , @entity15 , facility that supplies @entity0 's			1
nonetheless , our extremely high standards for our suppliers prohibit this conduct , " @entity0 's said in a statement , announcing its decision to cut ties with @entity13			1
@entity1 similarly said it was dropping @entity13 , which describes itself as the fifth - largest shell egg producer and marketer in the @entity54			2
the @entity16 - based egg supplier said it first heard about the abuse allegations from @entity57 , which conducted an investigation of the company			1
@entity13 launched an internal investigation upon learning about the undercover video , which was shot by an animal activist hired under false pretenses , according to @entity64 , president and owner of @entity13			1
four employees have been fired and management changes have taken place as a result of that investigation , which is ongoing , she said			0
an independent auditor from @entity72 was also hired to conduct a third - party animal welfare audit			0
" i was deeply saddened to see the story because this is n't who @entity13 is			2
acts depicted in the footage are totally unacceptable and completely at odds with our values as egg farmers			1
in fact , they are in direct violation of our animal care code of conduct , which all of our employees read , sign and follow each day , " @entity64 said in a statement			0
the release of the video and the company 's response come in the wake of a warning letter sent to @entity13 from the @entity98 earlier this week			1
the agency said it found " serious violations " after visiting five of the companies ' production facilities , including failure to have and implement a written @entity105 prevention plan and failure to prevent stray poultry , wild birds , cats and other animals from entering poultry houses			1
the company said it responded to the @entity98 , which in turn told @entity13 that some of the corrective actions it took were insufficient			1
further steps were then taken to remedy the situation , the company said			0
the egg industry has been a frequent target of animal rights groups , which accuse suppliers of keeping hens in unusually cruel conditions , and have sometimes used undercover videos to prove their point			1
in 2004 , @entity129 ( @entity129 ) released video showing slaughterhouse workers for a @entity133 supplier stepping on birds , kicking them and slamming them against walls and floors			2
according to @entity129 , it is common practice for workers to cut a hen 's beak with a hot blade at just a few days old , with no painkillers			0
those that survive are then kept in small wire cages , or battery cages , that are so small as to prevent them from lifting their wings , it says			0
the @entity153 advocates for so - called cage - free systems , which allow hens to walk around , spread their wings and lay their eggs in nests			0
however , the simple absence of battery cages is not enough to ensure a facility is " cruelty - free , " the rights group says			2
the egg industry has also been buffeted recently by food safety concerns			1
regulators recalled about 550 million eggs from the @entity54 market in the wake of a salmonella outbreak traced to two @entity15 farms in august			0
about 1,300 cases of salmonella was linked to eggs from @entity174 and @entity175 of @entity15 , forcing a recall of their products in at least 17 states , the @entity98 and the @entity170 reported			2
@entity179 recalled 380 million eggs , while @entity175 recalled 170 million eggs .			0

the activist group @entity11 releases undercover video shot at @entity13
the egg supplier says the footage depicts acts " completely at odds with our values "
the @entity98 finds " serious violations " at five of the company 's production facilities
the egg industry has been a frequent target of animal rights groups
