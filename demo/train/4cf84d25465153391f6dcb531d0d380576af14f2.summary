@entity0 became the latest state to have its ban on same - sex marriage overturned , after a state judge friday declared the voter - approved measure to be unconstitutional			1
twenty - one gay and lesbian couples were part of a group of plaintiffs challenging @entity11 83 to the @entity0 constitution , saying it violated their federal and state rights of equal protection and privacy			0
there was no indication from the court the decision would be temporarily put on hold pending appeal , leaving unclear whether some same - sex couples could begin getting married immediately			1
the state has the option of asking for a stay on enforcement , and the legal fight is now likely headed to the state supreme court			0
" our freedoms are often acquired slowly , but our country has evolved as a beacon of liberty in what is sometimes a dark world			2
these freedoms include a right to privacy , " said @entity39 circuit judge @entity38			0
" it is time to let that beacon of freedom shine brighter on all our brothers and sisters			1
we will be stronger for it			0
" the ruling continues a near - unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year , giving marriage - equality supporters unbridled encouragement that their ultimate goal will be achieved : eliminating all laws limiting the rights of homosexuals to wed. seventeen states and the @entity61 allow same - sex marriage within its borders : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity61			1
just a decade ago , there were none			2
friday also marks the two - year anniversary of president @entity83 voicing his public support for the first time of same - sex marriage , citing his own " evolution " on the issue			1
" at a certain point , i 've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same - sex couples should be able to get married , " said @entity83 at the time			1
groups supporting same - sex marriage applauded the @entity0 ruling			1
" judge @entity38 held that there is no good reason for discriminating against couples and their loved ones just because they are gay , " said @entity95 , president of @entity96 to marry			0
" with nearly 70 marriage cases now making their way through the courts , and five federal appellate courts now hearing arguments and soon to rule , today 's decision out of @entity0 underscores that all of @entity109 is ready for the freedom to marry			0
" a federal appeals court last month heard challenges to same - sex marriage bans in @entity114 and @entity115			1
appeals courts in coming weeks and months will hear similar challenges over current bans in @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , and @entity123 , including @entity124 next tuesday			0
in june , the @entity109 @entity125 cleared the way for same - sex marriages in @entity64 to resume after it ruled private parties did not have " standing " to defend a voter - approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state - sanctioned wedlock			2
more importantly , the high court also rejected parts of the @entity135 in its 5 - 4 " @entity137 " decision , citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits such as tax breaks			2
judge @entity38 cited the @entity137 case in tossing out the @entity0 statute			0
" the strength of our nation is in our freedom which includes , among others , freedom of expression , freedom of religion , the right to marry , the right to bear arms , the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures , the right of privacy , the right of due process and equal protection , and the right to vote regardless of race or sex , " he wrote			0
the state 's attorney general , @entity166 , earlier this week said he personally backs the same - sex marriage right , but that his duties require him to defend the current ban in all court challenges			1
the case is @entity173 of @entity0 ( @entity174 - 13 - 2662 ) .			0
