@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity4 and @entity6 @entity5 leaders promised greater efforts to step back from the partisan brink friday , acknowledging that @entity10 's toxic political climate has made it increasingly tough to tackle major problems			1
the pledge was immediately called into question , however , as the two parties repeatedly expressed sharply differing viewpoints during a rare meeting at a @entity6 @entity5 retreat in @entity0			1
@entity4 accepted an invitation from @entity6 @entity5 leaders to address their caucus			1
his speech friday was followed by an often pointed question - and - answer session			0
" @entity6 @entity5 leaders are grateful for [ @entity4 's ] willingness to come ... and have a frank and honest conversation , " said rep. @entity24 , @entity25			1
" we welcome the dialogue with the president			0
" the president accused @entity5 of frequently mischaracterizing his policy proposals , particularly in the health care debate			1
republicans , in turn , complained the @entity6 and congressional @entity35 had ignored their ideas , locked them out of the policy - making process and unfairly labeled them as obstructionists			2
" both sides can take some blame for a sour climate on @entity44 , " @entity4 said , adding that @entity35 and @entity5 need to be careful in choosing their rhetoric			1
" a ton of civility instead of slash and burn would be helpful			0
" the president highlighted what he said was problematic @entity5 rhetoric on his health care proposals			1
republicans , he said , had characterized the proposed program as some " kind of @entity57 plot			1
" in fact , he said that much of his plan was similar to what @entity5 had proposed during the failed @entity62 - era push to overhaul health care			1
both sides need to " close the gap a little bit between rhetoric and reality , " the president argued			0
calling his health care plan " some wild - eyed plot to impose big government in every aspect of our lives " leaves little room for bipartisan negotiation , @entity4 said			1
the president questioned how @entity5 could negotiate in good faith after using such rhetoric without exposing themselves to conservative primary challengers			2
@entity6 minority leader @entity81 , @entity82 , said he tried to be honest about differences over administration proposals			1
" i truly believe a government takeover of health care ... is the essence of their bill , " @entity81 said			1
@entity4 conceded there 's been a failure on his part to " try to foster better communications even if there 's disagreement			2
" he has promised regular meetings with @entity5 leaders in the future			2
@entity81 welcomed the gesture but said it is equally important for @entity6 speaker @entity101 to give @entity5 a greater role in the legislative process			1
@entity110 " is n't about taking one little @entity5 idea and throwing it in a 2,000 - page bill , " he said after @entity4 argued that @entity35 leaders had taken @entity5 proposals into account in the health care debate			1
" if you 're really serious about building a bipartisan product ... you need to do it from the beginning			0
" republicans criticized the president for failing to fulfill a promise to televise all the health care negotiations on @entity119			1
@entity4 called the criticism " legitimate " but noted the overwhelming majority of committee hearings on the legislation had been conducted in front of tv cameras			2
after the bills had cleared the committees , however , it became a " messy process , " he conceded			0
" i take responsibility for not having structured it in a way where it was all taking place in one place that could be filmed , " he said			0
@entity4 and @entity5 strongly criticized each other on a range of issues tied to taxes and spending			2
@entity5 leaders said @entity4 's $ 862 billion stimulus plan had been ineffective and repeatedly urged the president to consider an across - the - board tax cut			1
@entity4 said it would be wrong to slash taxes for the richest @entity145 or the banking sector in a weak economy			0
he also argued that the stimulus program had saved key jobs in @entity5 districts across the country			1
" there is not a single person in here who , had it not been for what was in the stimulus package , would n't be going home to more teachers laid off , more firefighters laid off , more cops laid off , " he said			0
" the component parts of the @entity164 are consistent " with what many republicans say are important , he said			0
the stimulus helped in terms of " rebuilding our infrastructure , tax cuts for families and businesses , and making sure that we were providing states and individuals some support when the roof was caving in			0
" the president said he agrees with the @entity5 emphasis on fiscal responsibility but hinted that @entity5 could do more to help control spending , including curtailing legislative earmark requests for their own districts			2
he also said he is willing to work with @entity5 on the enactment of a line - item veto			0
" there 's not a president out there that would n't like that , " he said			0
despite their disagreements , both sides agreed the day 's dialogue was a step in the right direction			0
" i hope that the conversation we begin here does n't end here , that we can continue our dialogue in the days ahead , " @entity4 said			0
the day " went very well , " @entity81 replied later			2
" there are issues we do agree on " and @entity5 will work to find " common ground			0
" we should " set aside perhaps the things that the president believes in that we philosophically do n't , but if there is some common ground we ought to go ahead forward with those , " said rep. @entity203 , @entity204			0
friday 's meeting , he said , was " the kind of discussion , frankly , that we need to have more of			0
