@entity1 , @entity0 -- as a city that sits astride two continents , @entity1 has always been a strategic gateway between the @entity6			1
but an ambitious railway project is pulling the two continents even closer together with the construction of the world 's deepest submerged tunnel			1
the 76 - kilometer ( 47.2 - mile ) @entity11 will include the world 's first submerged railway connection between @entity14 and @entity15 , ferrying passengers under a 1.4 - km ( 0.9 - m ) section of the @entity18			1
however , the massive infrastructure overhaul undertaken by @entity0 's @entity20 has not been without problems			2
the project started in 2004 and has suffered multiple setbacks due to the region 's rich heritage , as @entity0 's transport minister @entity26 explains			1
infographic : @entity1 and the @entity18 " the tunnel is going under a very historical area , [ a ] historical peninsula where the @entity33 settled ... so every piece of soil is examined by experts , archaeologists			1
at one point during construction , work had to be halted after the discovery of an ancient @entity40 port			1
" if [ the archaeologists ] say you can go , we go			0
if they stay stop , we stop , " @entity44 said			0
all of which has added five years onto the original construction deadline			2
watch : navigating the busy @entity18 to complicate matters further , the tunnel -- which passes under one of the busiest waterways in the world -- lies in an active earthquake zone			2
" there is a big , huge seismic activity risk so we have seismic joints in the tunnels , especially between the immersed tube tunnel and the bore tunnel , " says deputy project manager , @entity55			1
the joints between the tunnels are flexible and will protect the structure from seismic movements , @entity55 says			1
despite the setbacks , the project is scheduled for completion next year -- a target that will be met , @entity26 says			0
" we are very comfortable that the project is going to be complete by the end of next year			0
14 million people are just waiting [ for this tunnel to open			0
" ] when it does , the tunnel is expected to ease the congested road and ferry routes above carrying 75,000 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times			2
train drivers , like @entity80 , are already getting to grips with the new trains that will operate on the line			0
" it will be a great joy for me if i too can add a bit to this big project , " says @entity80 , a driver with almost four decades experience			0
" i 'm ready for my retirement but if i can see this through , it will be a great pleasure both for me , my children and grandchildren			0

@entity11 tunnel project in @entity1 will be first railway connection between @entity14 and @entity15
the 76 - kilometer route will ease *commuter* *traffic* on @entity1 's roads and strait
tunnel construction has been delayed by discovery of ancient *artifacts*
seismic activity also a *consideration* for *contractors* who have fitted " flexible joints " in the tunnel
