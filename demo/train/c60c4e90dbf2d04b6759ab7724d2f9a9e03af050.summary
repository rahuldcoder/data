@entity1 chairman @entity0 aggressively defended her decision to release a controversial @entity1 torture report tuesday , despite assertions from the @entity5 that interrogation techniques detailed in the report were effective in thwarting attack plans , capturing terrorists and saving @entity11 lives			1
in a testy interview with @entity14 's @entity13 on " @entity15 , " @entity0 said she was n't going to get into whether cia director @entity16 was lying about the torture techniques ' effectiveness , but that " there 's a big difference of opinion			2
" " if mr. @entity16 is making an argument that this kind of torture works , we can submit all kinds of experts to say it does n't work , " @entity0 said			2
" and we submit the record to say the record shows it did not work			0
" the report , which details the @entity5 's extreme interrogation techniques used on terrorists after the september 11th attacks , was released by @entity0 's committee despite a last - minute pleas from secretary of state @entity37 and members of @entity39 not to release the information to the public at this time			1
many opponents of the report 's release argued that the timing of the release could prompt global attacks on @entity11 -- skepticism later exemplified with the @entity49 issuing a terror alert bulletin			1
asked if she would feel guilty if @entity11 lives were lost as a result of the report , @entity0 said , " i would feel very badly , of course			1
i mean what do you think ? " but @entity0 argued , " there 's no perfect time to release this report			1
" " it 's possible that something happens even without this , " @entity0 said			0
" there have been beheadings			0
there have been attacks without this report coming out			0
this does n't mean that we should n't clean our house			0
" the @entity71 @entity70 also acknowledged that the timing of the release is important for political reasons			0
should the @entity75 take control of the @entity77 , @entity0 argued , " there 's some evidence " that the report would " never see the light of day			2
" @entity0 says she and her committee stand by a 14 - 1 vote taken in 2006 to release the report 's executive summary once it was completed			1
she also said that she believes that the release of the report , which took five - and - a - half years , " will meet the test of time			0
