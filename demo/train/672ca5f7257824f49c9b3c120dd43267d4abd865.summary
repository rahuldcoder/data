to his legions of fans , @entity0 has an almost other - world quality			1
the yoga guru inspires as he promises to heal body and mind			1
but to his critics , @entity0 is something else			1
they say he manipulates and preys on the young and vulnerable			2
now he faces six separate civil lawsuits from women accusing him of sexual assault or rape			2
" the one common thread to all their complaints is the betrayal of trust , " said attorney @entity15 , who represents the women			2
" it 's human nature			2
people are always looking for spiritual leaders			2
when you have traditional churches failing and people are looking for spiritual guidance , it is not surprising that people go to other arenas , " @entity15 told @entity3			0
" he told them he is on the same level as @entity36 and @entity37			0
" @entity0 is not facing any criminal charges and has denied any wrongdoing			1
in a lengthy , strongly - worded statement , the lawyers for @entity0 called the accusations " lurid " and said they were made to " apparently to exploit the legal system for financial gain			1
" " the women did not independently come forward to tell their stories of sexual assault after years of keeping them secret , " the statement said			0
" instead , they signed on to become plaintiffs in these cases following a world - wide and lengthy period of solicitation through letters and social media seeking to convince women to sue mr. @entity0			1
" @entity0 is the founder of @entity59 's @entity58 of @entity60			1
he 's featured prominently on its website , which details his system of performing 26 unique yoga poses while in a very hot room			1
the organization offers teacher trainings , which is where @entity0 allegedly met and groomed several victims			1
the latest lawsuit was filed this month by a woman identified as @entity72			0
in the suit , she 's described as a bright , driven woman who fell in love with @entity59 almost from her first class			2
she begged her parents to let her borrow money from her college fund to attend a grueling nine - week teacher training , which cost $ 10,000 at the time			0
she started the course in april 2010			0
the alleged abuse started very soon after			0
according to the lawsuit , it began with the married @entity0 trying to put his hand inside @entity72 's pants , eventually escalating to rape , which continued for years			1
" she was ashamed , and embarrassed			0
she did not think that anyone would believe her , and she was afraid that if defendant @entity0 heard that she had told , that he would kick her out of training and she would have lost both the $ 10,000 from her college fund , and her ability to work as a yoga instructor in order to pay for college , " the suit reads			1
it accuses @entity0 of rape at that training , and at a variety of other locations , including @entity60 , where he visited @entity72 in 2013			1
the suit says @entity72 feared speaking out earlier because she needed her @entity59 certification to support herself			0
she was also physically afraid of @entity0			1
@entity0 's lawyers said they have not yet been served with @entity72 's suit			1
" mr. @entity0 and the college have been successful in getting dismissed at an early stage multiple claims by several of the plaintiffs and awaiting decisions on other claims , " they added			1
@entity15 told @entity3 the six cases wo n't be combined because each woman has a different story			0
the accounts share certain similarities -- something that @entity0 's lawyers seized on as proof that the accusations were false			1
" the stories told by plaintiffs in their lawsuits are near copies of one another ; they are all authored by the same lawyer who recruited them , " their statement read			0
@entity128 started practicing @entity59 when she was 22			0
according to her civil suit , she came to yoga from a history of sexual trauma and felt that it allowed her to reconnect and reclaim her body			2
@entity135 went to @entity136 in 2006 where , the suit says , @entity0 raped her at his home with his wife and children upstairs			1
" @entity128 was broken and traumatized			0
she felt sick to her stomach but too scared of @entity59 to say anything			0
he was too powerful for her to go against , " the lawsuit reads			0
it alleges she was assaulted again in 2011			0
that time , @entity135 refused @entity0 's advances but , as a result , was retaliated against in her business , the suit says			1
