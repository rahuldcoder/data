-- is the future of computers a hybrid gadget that will combine the battery life and computing heft of a laptop with the portability and ease - of - use of a tablet ? some in the industry are leaning toward " yes			1
" but @entity12 ceo @entity11 pointedly says " no. " " anything can be forced to converge , but the problem is that products are about tradeoffs , and you begin to make tradeoffs to the point where what you have left at the end of the day does n't please anyone , " @entity11 said tuesday in response to a question during @entity12 's quarterly earnings report			1
" you can converge a toaster and refrigerator , but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user			2
" @entity11 's comments were at least in part a not - so - veiled jab at @entity33 , which , with its upcoming @entity35 operating system , will be combining its pc and tablet operating systems			1
the system is available in a beta format now and is expected to be released as a finished product this fall			2
a @entity33 spokesperson declined to comment for this article			1
but on @entity46 , lead @entity33 spokesman @entity44 made his own playful , appliance - oriented swipe			1
" must be a typo			2
it 's not a toaster / fridge			0
it 's a toaster / oven , " @entity44 wrote tuesday			0
" those seem pretty popular			0
" a late entrant , @entity54 has recently seen some relative success in the smartphone market , most notably with the @entity59 phones , which have sold more than 2 million units since they started rolling out in october			0
@entity35 is considered the computing giant 's most serious push to become a player in the tablet market as well			1
the system is a ground - up overhaul of its industry - leading operating system that has garnered positive reviews since it was released in beta form about a month and a half ago			1
currently , there 's no new product announced that would qualify as a @entity54 8 - powered , tablet - @entity37 hybrid			1
but it 's definitely on folks ' minds			0
@entity77 has shown off a prototype of a computer that flips from " consumption mode " ( i.e. a tablet ) to " work mode " ( a laptop similar to the emerging line of sleek @entity85 )			1
@entity12 , of course , has dominated the tablet market since unveiling the @entity88 in 2010			1
on tuesday , @entity12 announced it sold 11.8 million @entity88 in the first quarter of this year , bringing the total sold to 67 million in roughly two years			1
it took the company 24 years to sell that many @entity94 computers			0
as such , the company has little obvious reason to tout the need , or desire , for a new kind of device when it 's pounding the competition with the current one			2
" the tablet market is going to be huge , " @entity11 said			2
" as the ecosystem gets better and better and we continue to double down on making great products , i think the limit here is nowhere in sight			2
" but some observers said wednesday that @entity11 's reluctance to embrace a possible tablet - laptop convergence seems a bit ironic			1
was n't there some other device that critics said would fail because it combined too many things ? " wrote @entity117 's @entity116			0
which has sold 70 million units in the last six months			0
" he provided links to multiple articles , including his own , from 2007 that questioned whether a pricey phone that sends e-mail , surfs the @entity132 , plays video games and lets you listen to @entity135 would catch on			0
or to put it differently , it was a product that combined a toaster , a refrigerator and a few other appliances to boot			0
" the point is : sometimes convergence works , " @entity116 wrote			0
" if you combine features that people want in a smart way , and sell it at the right price , it can work			0
@entity11 of all people should know that			0

@entity12 ceo : tablet - pc hybrids are like combining toasters and refrigerators
@entity33 is making a play with @entity35 for tablets and *pcs*
with @entity88 sales *soaring* , @entity12 has little reason to push for a new gadget
@entity33 says converging operating systems are the future of computing
