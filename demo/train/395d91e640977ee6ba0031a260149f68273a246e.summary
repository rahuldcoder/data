@entity0 -- a libel case against the parents of @entity9 " feels very personal , " the mother of the @entity4 student convicted of murder in @entity6 told @entity1			1
" i would n't say the @entity6 justice system ( is after us			2
) i would say a few people in @entity21 , definitely , " @entity12 said , referring to the central @entity6 city where @entity14 was tried for the 2007 killing of her @entity17 roommate @entity19			1
she cited a radio commentator who suggested the authorities ' attitude seemed to be : " maybe if we keep at them they 'll go away or go bankrupt or whatever			2
" but it 's not stopping us , " she said			2
" it 's all about truth and justice and we have done nothing wrong , " she said			2
" @entity9 's allowed to tell her story and she 's been saying it hundreds of times since she was arrested , " @entity12 said			1
" when we get asked , ' what did @entity9 tell you ? ' , we tell the truth : here 's what @entity9 said			2
and that 's why we 're being charged			2
" mellas and her ex-husband , @entity14 , were indicted tuesday on charges of libeling police in @entity21 , she and the family 's @entity6 attorney said			1
in a 2009 interview in the @entity52 of @entity53 , they said that their daughter " had not been given an interpreter , had not received food and water , and had been physically and verbally abused " by police after her arrest for the murder of the exchange student , according to @entity6 's @entity62 news agency			1
they also said police struck her and told her " things will get worse for you " if she requested an attorney			1
" yes , i am going to trial for libel ... along with one of my lawyers and a group of journalists , " @entity12 told @entity1 tuesday			1
" we are very upset by this decision , " said @entity75 , @entity9 's attorney who represents her family in this case			2
" we worked toward a dismissal because there was no intent " on the part of @entity14 's parents to libel the police , he said			1
the indictment says their claims were " contrary to the truth , " according to @entity62			1
" we knew this was coming for a while , " @entity12 said			1
" i got served my papers a year ago , back over a year ago , so i knew , we knew this was coming			2
" she said she would attend hearings in her own trial only if she happened to be in @entity6 anyway			2
but she would continue to fight the charges for fear she could be arrested in @entity6 if she does not , she said			0
" we have to jump through the hoops until i know that i will never have to go back to that country again , " she said			0
" i think our case may go years , depending on what happens in @entity21			0
if we 're found guilty we will appeal , even if it means going to the @entity103 , " she said			0
she said fighting the charges had been financially draining			0
" i think we 've mortgaged just about everything we can mortgage , but there 's been very kind people who have sent donations to help pay for @entity9 's defense , " she said			0
a hearing in the parents ' case is set for july 4 , @entity75 said			1
" these are old charges , " said @entity113 , spokesman for the family			0
" they 've been around since 2009			1
" the story in question was published in 2008 , he said , and @entity14 's parents were repeating what their daughter had told them			1
the indictment , @entity123 said , finalizes the charges the prosecutor had filed and is " nothing surprising			2
" @entity14 's parents ' focus is not on their case , he said , but on her appeal of her conviction , which is under way			1
there is a break in the proceedings for experts to retest forensic evidence , he said			0
" this is , i guess you 'd call it , a bit of a minor distraction , " @entity113 said			0
@entity14 , 23 , was sentenced in december to 26 years in prison for @entity148 's death at the villa the two shared in @entity21 , the central @entity6 town where both were students			1
@entity148 , 21 , was found dead in november 2007 , semi-naked with her throat slashed			0
@entity14 and her former @entity6 boyfriend , @entity153 , were both found guilty of the murder			1
@entity153 is serving a 25 - year sentence			0
a third person , @entity19 , a drifter originally from the @entity158 , was tried separately and is serving a 16 - year prison sentence			0
the forensic experts retesting evidence as part of @entity14 's appeal must conclude their analysis by may 9 and their results are to be presented on may 21 to a jury composed of two judges and six citizens			1
evidence being retested includes a knife found in @entity153 's apartment with @entity14 's dna on the handle and what @entity21 prosecutors say is @entity148 's dna in a tiny groove on the blade			1
the prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab @entity148 in the neck and that it had been cleaned			0
the dna matter attributed to @entity148 consists of flesh , not blood , they say			0
the sample , however , was so small that forensic scientists investigating @entity148 's murder were not able to double test it in accordance with international forensic science norms , which @entity14 's legal team says raises doubts about its validity			1
the second piece of evidence the forensic experts will test is the tiny metal clasp from @entity148 's bra , which was cut from her body after her slaying			0
forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that @entity153 's dna is present on the metal clasp			0
the clasp was identified on an investigatory video on november 2 , 2007 , when @entity148 's body was found			0
but the clasp was not collected until nearly six weeks later , giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated			0
the court is not expected to make a final ruling on the appeal until next summer			0
@entity1 's @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and journalist @entity218 contributed to this report .			0
