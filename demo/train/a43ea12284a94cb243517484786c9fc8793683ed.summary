-- from the red carpet to the @entity4 , a public figure 's fashion choices convey intent and state of mind			1
during tuesday 's presidential debate , the flashbulb - wielding peanut gallery will express more curiosity about health care reform and foreign policy than about who designed @entity14 's ensemble			1
but while what each candidate is wearing certainly is n't ballot - worthy , neither campaign seems to be taking any chances -- even with something as small as an @entity21 flag lapel pin			2
" the littlest things can throw a campaign so the candidates tend to keep it safe and let the wives be the peacocks of the campaign , " said @entity22 , runway analyst and director of @entity21 content for @entity25 , a fashion forecasting service			1
despite their political leanings , @entity22 said both @entity14 and president @entity36 tend to lean toward the conservative side when it comes to wardrobe policy			1
" when it comes to things like creating brand image where everybody does the same thing or people are consistent , it helps consumers and voters remember who they 're looking at , " said @entity22 , calling to mind @entity51 ' black turtleneck , jeans and @entity55 sneakers ; @entity57 's gray t - shirts ; and even @entity59 's sweater vests			2
@entity14 's campaign - trail uniform of a button - down @entity62 shirt with rolled - up sleeves and blue jeans helps disassociate him from the immense personal wealth that has often been a point of contention , said @entity22			1
@entity36 , on the other hand , is more likely to appear on the campaign trail in a tailored power suit , rolling his sleeves or taking off his jacket for a more casual look , she said			1
" i think he 's much better off in a suit , " iconic @entity21 designer @entity74 told @entity0 's @entity75 about president @entity36			1
" he needs to be in a suit and he 's really professional and proper in a suit and he 's being photographed all the time so he should have his game on			0
" meanwhile , @entity82 vice presidential contender @entity81 has been lambasted in heavy - hitting fashion publications like @entity84 , @entity85 and the @entity86 for his poorly tailored suits			1
@entity88 , the men 's fashion editor of @entity90 : the @entity91 , told @entity92 , the @entity86 fashion critic : " i think he suffers from the misconception that the size a guy wears directly correlates with his masculinity			1
in their minds , being a 42 is more manly than a 40			0
and yet what actually happens when a guy wears something too big is the obvious : he looks smaller , dwarfed by shoulders that are too big , a shirt collar that is too roomy , lapels that are too wide			0
" " i think he looks like an @entity21 businessman on a weekend and i think he 's trying to portray that -- i think he wants people to think he 's the guy next door in his dress , so i think he 's accomplishing that , " said @entity74 of @entity81			1
@entity14 , @entity81 love @entity112			1
founder finds that ironic of course , what the candidates ' wives wear gets even more scrutiny			0
" i think @entity118 brought back that focus on fashion and the first lady having a look -- and that trickles over to the men as well , " said @entity22			2
although style mavens generally tend to covet the first lady 's ensembles , @entity118 did receive heavy criticism when she opted for an @entity130 gown for a 2011 state dinner with @entity133 president @entity132 , instead of a more diplomatic choice of an @entity136 - @entity21 designer			1
and long before @entity138 took center stage during the last presidential debate , another yellow bird ruffled a few feathers			0
in may , @entity142 faced a backlash after sporting an off - the - rack $ 990 @entity145 t - shirt with a prominent yellow bird design during an interview on @entity148 's " this morning			1
" critics called her choice to wear such an expensive staple item " out of touch			0
" according to @entity154 , a @entity156 assistant professor , color choice is also powerful visual tool -- whether viewers know it or not			0
@entity159 's is one of the most famous examples of color theory with its branded combination of yellow and red			0
@entity165 is known to illicit feelings of hunger while yellow tends to convey a sense of rush ; a fitting combination for a fast food chain			0
@entity172 said since the late @entity173 of " @entity174 " popularized the concept of red ( @entity82 ) and blue ( @entity177 ) states , who wears what color tie has been a very circumscribed choice			0
in the most recent debate , @entity14 opted for a red , diagonally striped tie while @entity36 opted for a blue tie with a very minimal pattern			1
@entity14 's choice of diagonals was smart , said @entity172 because diagonals imply " a strong sense of movement			2
" @entity36 's small , muted pattern fell in line with his more laid back performance in the debate , she said			2
as for the wives , @entity172 said both women made smart wardrobe choices for the last debate , including the first lady 's choice of a warmer blue suit			2
" that kind of color is a symbol to her loyalty , " said @entity172 -- very fitting on debate night , but also the couple 's 20th wedding anniversary			0
@entity142 , keeping with the patriotic red , white and blue palette , opted for an ivory suit			2
" that 's a color that in scientific terms reflects all colors and it also references a fresh , new outlook and peace , " said @entity172			0
for tuesday 's debate , @entity172 predicts the candidates will stick with the same tie colors but opt for hints of the opposing color -- to promote a more bipartisanship , moderate tone in a tight election			0
do you pay attention to what the candidates and their spouses are wearing ? how much of an impact does it make on your opinion of them ? share your thoughts in the comments below			0
