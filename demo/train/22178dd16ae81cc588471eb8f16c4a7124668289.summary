the @entity3 evacuated its 18 - man crew saturday night , and it drifted for 10 hours on sunday after the tug that was towing it lost power			1
monday night , tug crews had to cut the rig loose during a storm that whipped up 24 - foot waves , leading to its grounding			1
crews battle harsh weather trying to tow drilling unit to @entity9 harbor @entity50 , @entity7 's @entity9 operations manager , said tuesday that the rig " is upright , rocking with a slow motion , and is stable " -- but he added , " there is still a lot of work to be done to bring this to a safe conclusion			1
" three people suffered minor injuries over the past few days , but have already returned to work , @entity50 said			0
the rig was aground in an area of @entity61 , where water depth is 32 feet to 48 feet			2
a joint command has been set up to handle salvage efforts , but ongoing bad weather has kept crews from getting aboard the vessel , @entity16 said			0

@entity7 rig accident off @entity9 shows dangers of drilling in @entity29 " it 's a scary thought you know , because our food chain is out there			1
our people rely on our food , " she said			0
@entity7 says it 's working at far less depth and lower pressures than the @entity90 well that erupted off @entity113 , killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher that took three months to cap			0
the fuel on board the rig is used to power equipment and is not the result of the drilling operations @entity7 conducted off the @entity33 , on the opposite side of the vast state from where the @entity11 now rests			1
the @entity124 estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable by drilling			0
and the shrinking of the region 's sea ice -- which hit record lows in 2012 -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region			0
climate researchers say that a decrease in sea ice is a symptom of a warming climate , caused largely by the combustion of carbon - rich fossil fuels			0
the science is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most scientists			0
