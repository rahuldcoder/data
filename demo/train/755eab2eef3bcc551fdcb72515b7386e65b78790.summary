-- as they meet for the first time tuesday , @entity2 president @entity1 and @entity5 's president - elect @entity3 a @entity6 will be operating in a landscape of @entity2 - @entity5 relations that has changed profoundly since @entity5 's outgoing president , @entity11 , took office six years ago			1
illegal immigration is at the lowest level in four decades , and organized crime violence , which has driven much of recent cooperation between the two countries , is finally declining			2
violence remains a critical issue , but economic issues -- bilateral and global -- have risen to the fore as both countries struggle to emerge from the global slowdown			1
the two leaders will need to give greater emphasis to economic issues , including job creation			1
but this is also an opportunity to strengthen cooperation on global issues			1
in most trading relationships , the @entity2 simply buys goods or sells them to other countries			0
with its neighbors @entity5 and @entity34 , however , the @entity2 actually co-manufactures products			0
roughly 40 % of all content in @entity5 exported to the @entity2 originates in the @entity2			0
opinion : to - do list for @entity1 and @entity5 's new president the comparable figures with @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 are 4 % , 3 % and 2 % , respectively			1
only @entity34 , at 25 % , is close			0
the @entity2 and @entity5 economies are so deeply linked , growth in one country benefits the other , and lowering the transaction costs of goods crossing the border helps put money in the pockets of workers and consumers			0
to do this , it will be important to improve border ports of entry by investing in infrastructure and staffing , as well as implementing new risk management techniques to speed up trusted shipments across the border			0
pursuing an @entity65 between the two nations ' airlines and making the cross-border trucking pilot program -- in which @entity5 truckers can carry goods deep into the @entity2 and vice versa -- would also strengthen competitiveness			1
although these are generally seen as border issues , the benefits accrue to @entity2 states that depend on exports and joint manufacturing with @entity5 , including @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			2
@entity5 also has abundant oil reserves and one of the four or five largest stocks of shale gas in the world			0
@entity5 's new government will probably pursue major energy reform over the next couple of years that could spur oil and gas production in dramatic ways			1
if that happens , it is certain to detonate a cycle of investment in the @entity5 economy and could significantly contribute to discussions on possible @entity103 energy security			2
opinion : @entity5 's misconceptions @entity1 and @entity3 a @entity6 's administrations also offer a time for critical opportunities in education			1
with an ambitious but inexpensive public and private venture to spur educational exchange , @entity5 could train its next generation of engineers , scientists and medical professionals in @entity2 universities while @entity103 students enjoy access to @entity120 and other cultural competencies in @entity5 that they need to compete in the global economy			2
without doubt , security cooperation will also remain a critical part of the relationship between the nations			0
with most of the largest drug trafficking organizations crippled , it is time to focus on strategies that lessen violence and build the rule of law			0
the @entity2 government can still do a great deal more to reduce money laundering and arms trafficking , and the @entity5 government has its work cut out to reform its police , prosecutors and courts			0
these efforts can be far more effective if the nations work together to benefit the safety and security of citizens in both countries			0
migration is the one issue the two leaders will talk about tuesday that matters a great deal to both nations but does not lend itself easily to a bilateral agreement			0
but the enormous drop in @entity5 immigration to the @entity2 -- most studies show that illegal immigration has dropped to net zero and may be negative -- allows the two countries to think seriously about what @entity5 might be willing to do to police its borders if the @entity2 undertakes a major overhaul of its immigration laws			2
finally , as @entity5 continues to grow economically , it will be increasingly possible for the two governments to focus on global challenges			2
@entity5 hosted the @entity168 earlier this year and also joined the talks for the @entity171 trade agreement , which led to extensive discussions between the two governments on global economic issues			1
opinion : @entity176 's challenge trade , security and migration will undoubtedly remain the most important topics as the two leaders meet			1
but as the bilateral relationship develops , relations between the nations might one day resemble those between the @entity2 and @entity34 , in which global issues can be equally important			1
a balanced and wide - ranging @entity2 - @entity5 agenda -- one that seeks creative and collaborative approaches on topics ranging from local gangs to global terrorist networks and from regional supply chains to international finance -- promises significant benefits to people in both nations in the coming years			1
