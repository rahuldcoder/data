one of the most prominent developers of the plan that could shut the government down is a little - known congressman who has been in office only eight months			1
this newly elected @entity5 aligned lawmaker downplays his position , saying he has relatively little influence			2
but in reality , his efforts have pushed @entity11 to the brink			2
at issue is the @entity14 , also known as @entity14			1
some @entity15 are demanding that it be dismantled -- or at the very least delayed - and they think the best way to do that is attach it to a must - pass bill to fund the government			2
the idea has rankled @entity11 for more than a week and exposed fissures in the @entity15			2
so who is the lawmaker quietly influencing the debate ? sen. @entity28 , who staged a 21 - hour talk - a - thon on the @entity31 floor disparaging @entity14 , would be a good guess			1
but it would be wrong			2
the persuasive the answer ? @entity35 , who represents the western part of @entity37 and has wielded his influence behind the bright lights of the television cameras and the hot microphones			1
in august , while lawmakers spent time in their districts , @entity35 wrote a letter to his @entity15 leaders suggesting they tie the dismantling of @entity14 to the bill that funds the government for the next year			1
the letter read : " @entity50 wrote in @entity51 no. 58 that ' the power over the purse may , in fact , be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon ... for obtaining a redress of every grievance ... ' " meadows successfully convinced 79 of his colleagues to sign on to his letter			2
and he went further , leading a group of 40 lawmakers to demand that the continuing resolution , or the short - term government funding bill at issue , zeroes out funding for president @entity69 's signature domestic policy achievement so far			2
@entity15 divisions force delay in @entity73 's debt strategy in a lengthy interview with @entity75 , @entity35 explained his case			1
" our intent has never been to shut down the government , " @entity35 said			1
" it 's to stop the [ health care ] law			0
" senate majority leader @entity83 called those advocating for such a plan " anarchists			0
" a " bad day for government is a good day for the tea party , " @entity83 said on the @entity31 floor last week			1
meadows vs. the @entity15 @entity15 leaders in the @entity93 were reluctant and dismissed the plan -- at first			0
speaker @entity73 and many @entity15 believed the strategy could lead to shutdown as the @entity97 - led @entity31 would never agree to such a plan			1
additionally , leaders believed that @entity15 would be blamed for a shut down			0
@entity101 backs up their concern			0
a recent @entity75 / @entity103 indicated that 51 % of respondents would blame republicans			0
that 's a political risk that leadership did n't want to risk			0
even though @entity35 ' letter does n't represent a majority of the caucus , it was a factor in persuading @entity73 to reverse course and put forward a plan that funds the government but defunds @entity14			1
running against politics @entity35 said he understands that " leadership has a different responsibility			1
" and that leadership is responsible for thinking about the party			2
" this type of vote could potentially hurt our long term goals			0
i understand that , " he said			0
but he said that 's not his concern			0
" my job first is to make sure i represent the people back home , " @entity35 said			1
" i do n't believe that when i get here that people expect me to look at the political implications			0
that 's for somebody else to focus on			0
" for him , getting rid of @entity14 is priority no. 1			1
" [ @entity139 ] o ignore that would be to ignore our duty to represent the people back home , " he said			0
' @entity145 ' " for me it 's about representing the 749,000 people i was elected to represent , " @entity35 told @entity75 in his small @entity147 office			1
he said his constituents want him to fight against @entity14 " regardless of consequences			1
" @entity35 represents a conservative constituency			1
he was elected in 2012 and succeeded democrat @entity152 , who decided not to run for reelection after the latest round of redistricting made the district swing heavily @entity15			0
meadows won by 15 percentage points			0
@entity15 presidential candidate @entity159 won the district with 61 % of the vote , an impressive outcome in a state he won by 1 point			0
exclusive : @entity159 disagrees with @entity93 @entity15 ' tactics ' on @entity14 but there 's more to the story			1
@entity35 works very closely with the tea party groups and he is a conduit to their agenda			1
in fact , his catapult from local businessman to elected official was launched with the help of local tea party groups			1
he underwent a vigorous interview process with the @entity37 - aligned @entity5 groups that included an intense vetting and interviewing process			2
@entity183 , head of the @entity186 , @entity37 , tea party group and its separate political action committee , said it is to ensure candidates " truly represents who we are and what we want them to do			1
" @entity183 is pleased with @entity157 ' job performance so far			0
she said @entity35 is " turning out to be our poster boy			1
" on the issue of @entity14 , " he truly represents us , " @entity183 said			1
well - funded national tea party - aligned organizations , such @entity197 , are also watching closely			1
like @entity183 's organization , they hold lawmakers accountable			0
not only do they keep scorecards of how lawmakers vote on legislation , they are keeping track of what letters they sign on to and their role in every step of the legislative process			2
@entity15 leaders are well aware of the influence of these organizations			0
@entity15 rep. @entity15 of @entity215 , who was elected in 1998 and finds himself between the new generation of tea party - aligned groups and the more traditional @entity15 leadership , said the tea party groups " impacts everybody			1
" @entity223 said that @entity157 hosts conference calls with the groups ' members to explain what 's happening in @entity228 , including the challenges that he faces promoting their agenda			1
she said he told them he 's " persona non grata " around the halls of @entity228			1
@entity183 said she and her members remind him : " they do n't elect you			0
" they also offer assurance : " we have your back			0
we will support you , " @entity183 said she tells him			0
@entity35 relayed a similar sentiment			1
" there 's nobody in @entity11 , who ever voted for me and there 's no one in @entity11 , who will ever vote for me , " @entity35 said			1
" so it 's about representing the people back home			0
" the non-leadership leader " i think everybody wants me to pick a fight with leadership , " @entity35 said			1
but he contended that he is n't about playing the rebel , but finding results			0
are his tactics working ? @entity35 said yes			1
" the @entity31 for the first time is having to vote ... on @entity14 , " @entity35 said			1
" that 's why we had to do this			0
" the @entity93 has now voted 42 times on either defunding or repealing all or parts of @entity14			1
many republicans in the @entity31 thought the idea was a lost cause , including @entity272 @entity15 @entity271 , who said friday that the strategy " wo n't work			2
" the @entity31 eliminated the health care portion of the bill on friday before sending a revised spending plan back to the @entity93 for consideration over the weekend			2
a shutdown would occur tuesday , if there is no spending plan in place			2
but @entity35 successfully convinced a reluctant @entity73 to go along with his plan			1
and then after it became clear the @entity31 was n't going to play ball , the speaker hoped to move past the fight and pass a funding bill that would be able to pass the @entity31 , meaning it would n't defund health care			0
but @entity73 's @entity15 caucus , once again with @entity157 in the forefront , rejected that plan			0
@entity73 's now working on a plan that will appease members such as @entity157			0
what do shutdown and debt limit have to do with @entity14 ? meanwhile , @entity35 vowed to hold his ground			1
" if there is a real plan to make sure we can accomplish it through some other means , i 'm willing to look at that , " he said			0
but he said it must involve " at least delaying " the implementation of @entity14			2
if it does n't , he is willing to buck his leadership and oppose any bill he does n't think goes far enough			0
he admits some will have to take " some tough votes " to take			0
but for him he 's right where his constituents want him to be			0
" it 's a safe place for me to be , " @entity35 said			2
polarizing @entity11 @entity35 rejected the idea that he is adding to the gridlock in @entity11			2
he said @entity11 politicians have lost their way , but it 's not because of their inability to compromise			0
" pragmatism has been at the cost of principle and principle has been at the cost of pragmatism , " he said			0
still , @entity35 asserted that he is willing to compromise with the @entity97			2
" my ultimate success will be viewed by whether there is something we can accomplish , " he said .			0

a little - known , *freshman* congressman is flexing his legislative muscle in @entity228
@entity35 insisted on strategy of defunding of @entity14 as a condition of new spending
