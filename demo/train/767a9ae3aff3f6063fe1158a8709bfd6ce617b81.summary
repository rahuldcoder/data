the first frosts of winter have already dusted the spectacular city of @entity2 with a powder of glistening ice			0
the air outside feels sharp and crisp			0
@entity6 hurry along the elegant boulevards , wrapped up tight against the biting cold			1
@entity6 's winter , its annual deep freeze , has begun			1
but this year there 's more than just a bitter chill in the air			0
for the past nine months relations with the @entity15 have become decidedly frosty too			0
on the face of it the problem is @entity19			2
the @entity15 backed a popular uprising there in march , which toppled a @entity23 - friendly government			0
infuriated , @entity6 's president , @entity24 , annexed the strategic @entity25 , where it has a key naval base			1
since then he has been accused of fuelling a separatist rebellion in the mainly @entity6 - speaking east of the country			1
that unrest has already cost more than 4,000 lives			0
the @entity32 and @entity33 have imposed costly sanctions and travel bans			0
on the international stage , @entity6 has been excluded from the @entity39 group of industrialized nations			1
at the recent @entity42 summit in @entity43 , president @entity24 was cold - shouldered by his @entity45 counterparts			1
but the @entity6 leader appears unmoved , his @entity19 policy unchanged			1
one fascinating explanation for the failure of @entity45 sanctions and rebukes to change this vast country 's behavior may be in the mindset , the world view , of its strongman president			0
i 'm one of the few @entity45 journalists to have sat down with @entity24			2
i met him at his residence outside @entity60 in 2008 , just after @entity6 's invasion of @entity62			1
i asked him back then if he could guarantee that @entity6 troops would not invade other former @entity65 states , like @entity19			1
he reacted quite angrily , saying he objected to my question			0
it was @entity6 , he said , who should be given guarantees that no one attacks us			1
the comment sheds light , i think , on how @entity24 sees the world outside the walls of the @entity23			2
for him , @entity6 is under constant threat from the @entity15			2
@entity77 expansion into former @entity79 nations has eroded @entity6 's security			1
the prospect of @entity62 joining the western military alliance , let alone @entity19 , is unthinkable for him			2
the @entity85 , from this perspective , has never really ended ; we 're still living in the 1980s			0
the @entity15 , in particular the @entity32 , still strives to " subjugate " @entity6			2
president @entity24 repeated this just a few days ago in @entity87			2
sanctions are an inevitable consequence of @entity6 's resistance to this subjugation			1
@entity19 was the motive , but if it had not been @entity19 it would likely have been something else			0
from a @entity45 perspective , this seems like a cynical distortion of the facts , a @entity23 ploy to confuse and obfuscate			0
but it may help explain why @entity6 is doing what it is doing , and why sanctions are not changing -- and may never change -- @entity23 policy			1
it may also help to explain why , at a time of growing economic hardship , @entity6 's president remains so utterly popular at home			1
his world view is theirs too			0
like the harsh cold of the coming @entity6 winter , confrontation with the @entity15 is inevitable and must be endured .			0
