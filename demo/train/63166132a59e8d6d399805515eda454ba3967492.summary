@entity0 , a key @entity1 ally and a @entity3 member that borders the territory captured by @entity5 , which now calls itself the @entity6 , in @entity7 and @entity8 , could play a critical role in the @entity1 - led military assault against the jihadist group			1
@entity12 has the second - largest army in @entity3 and hosts an @entity1 airbase			1
@entity0 forces could participate in the @entity1 - led bombing , or @entity12 could allow the @entity1 to use the @entity17 in southern @entity0 to stage the attacks			1
but @entity0 prefers to play a secondary role			1
citing its concern over the fate of 49 hostages who were captured by @entity5 when the group seized @entity24 in june , it limited its role to stemming the flow of foreign fighters , tightening border security , and cracking down on @entity5 's oil - smuggling networks			2
the hostages were released over the weekend following what @entity0 president @entity31 described as a " covert rescue operation			1
" now that the @entity0 government 's thorny dilemma has been resolved , will @entity12 change its stance ? to the delight of its @entity39 allies , @entity0 signaled a possible change in policy on tuesday when @entity31 said " @entity12 could give military or logistical support to @entity1 - led air strikes against @entity6 insurgents in @entity7			1
" but the @entity0 president 's change in tone is more likely to be , not a change of heart , but rather an attempt to allay international criticism that has been mounting since @entity1 president @entity52 laid out his strategy to fight @entity5			1
the release of the hostages might have removed a major obstacle to @entity0 's playing a frontline role in the @entity1 - led @entity59 coalition , but there are many more			1
@entity12 and @entity61 have different priorities in the conflict			0
@entity61 is primarily concerned about the rise of @entity5 and views the conflict through the lens of counter-terrorism			0
hit hard by the ongoing civil war in @entity7 , @entity0 sees @entity5 as a symptom of the brutality of an illegitimate regime in its neighboring country that has posed @entity12 far greater challenges			2
the @entity7 civil war has dealt a blow to @entity0 's image as a regional superpower that mediates regional conflicts and pursues a non-sectarian foreign policy			0
@entity0 hosts more than 1.2 million @entity7 refugees [ @entity81 now believes there are more than 1.5 million refugees ] , which incurs not only financial costs but also presents political dilemmas for the @entity0 government in addressing the ethnic and sectarian balance within its own society			0
for @entity0 the most dangerous fallout of the @entity7 civil war has been the resurgence of the @entity91 ( @entity91 )			0
in retaliation for @entity0 's support for the @entity7 opposition , @entity92 gave a free hand to the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , the @entity7 offshoot of the @entity91 based in northern @entity7 , by allowing it to operate unencumbered , recruit new fighters for its campaign against @entity0 , and undertake a pseudo-governmental role in @entity105 regions of @entity7			0
the backbone of @entity0 's @entity7 policy has been to ignore isis because it has been waging war against the @entity105 group in northern @entity7			0
@entity0 believes that fighting the @entity92 regime is more important than the narrow counter-terrorism mission that president @entity52 has in mind			0
a military attack against @entity5 is likely to strengthen not only @entity92 's but also the @entity97 's hand			0
to @entity31 , a strong advocate of regime change , anything short of @entity92 's ouster carries the risk of further weakening @entity0 domestically and regionally and fueling extremism			2
there is also a deep - seated lack of trust in a long - term @entity1 commitment to the resolution of the conflicts in @entity8 and @entity7 that has kept @entity0 from playing a frontline role in the coalition against @entity5			1
enmeshed in a three - decade - long fight against the @entity91 , @entity0 knows all too well that countering @entity5 calls for long - term international commitment and cooperation			2
@entity12 does not want to render itself even more vulnerable to @entity5 attacks without an assurance from the @entity1 that it will not leave @entity0 in the lurch			2
domestic and regional public opinion is another point of concern			0
@entity0 public opinion has always been skeptical of @entity1 involvement in @entity0 and the @entity140			2
therefore , @entity0 has historically been wary of allowing the @entity1 to carry out military operations from the @entity1 airbase in @entity143			2
taking an active military role in a @entity1 - led military strike against a @entity147 entity is likely to draw criticism from the people of the region as well			1
@entity0 's image as an independent actor that is looking after its own interests and willing to defy @entity39 powers if necessary has won @entity12 favorable notice in the @entity157 world			0
the @entity0 parliament 's refusal to allow the @entity1 to station troops on @entity0 soil to open a second front against @entity8 in 2003 challenged @entity0 's old image as an @entity1 stooge and increased @entity0 's credibility on the @entity157 street			0
the @entity0 government does not want to deal a blow to its regional image by taking part in another @entity39 - led military operation in a @entity173 country			1
hemmed in by these constraints , @entity0 seems unlikely to take an active military role in the strikes against @entity5 unless the @entity1 shifts its policy to effect regime change in @entity7			1
until then , @entity0 will focus its diplomatic energy on convincing its allies at the @entity181 to set up a buffer zone along its border with @entity7 .			0

@entity0 could play a key role in the @entity1 - led military assault against @entity5 , writes @entity187
@entity12 has the second - largest army in @entity3 and hosts an @entity1 airbase , he says
but @entity0 prefers to play a secondary role , he writes
