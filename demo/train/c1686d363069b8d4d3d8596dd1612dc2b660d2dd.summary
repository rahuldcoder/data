despite concluding there was no foul play in the death of a @entity5 teen nearly two years ago , a sheriff 's office conducted additional interviews on the case as recently as this month			1
the parents of @entity9 , who was found dead inside a rolled - up gym mat at his school in @entity12 , @entity5 , have been unwavering in their belief that their son was murdered , even after the @entity15 ruled the death accidental and closed the case 18 months ago			1
the details of the recent interviews , conducted by the sheriff 's office between november 24 and december 15 , were provided to @entity21 in response to a public records request			1
the sheriff 's office interviewed about two dozen current and former @entity26 students who were on the school 's wrestling team on january 10 , 2013 , the day @entity9 disappeared			1
his body was found the next day			0
the additional interviews appear to be related to a video released by attorneys for @entity9 's family that challenged the whereabouts of one particular former student who was on the wrestling team			2
according to investigative records , the former student confronted @entity9 and told him " it ai n't over " regarding a confrontation @entity9 had with the former student 's younger brother			2
@entity21 is not naming the former student because he has not been called a suspect or been charged with a crime			0
the former student would have been at a wrestling match in another city at the time @entity9 is believed to have died , but lawyers say the bus did not leave @entity26 until after @entity9 's death			2
an attorney for the sheriff 's office confirmed the recent interviews , but did not respond to a question about whether the case has been reopened			1
" the @entity15 initiated the interviews of the @entity26 wrestling team coach , the bus driver and wrestling team members in response to claims made known to the sheriff 's office that the wrestling team was still on the school 's campus when @entity9 was last known to have been alive , " according to a statement provided by the department 's attorney			1
" investigators have tried unsuccessfully to contact some wrestling team members and will continue to attempt to reach those team members			0
" the statement added that the interviews so far have not changed the facts believed by the sheriff 's office			1
" the information gathered thus far indicates that the bus carrying the wrestling team had left the school 's campus prior to the time that @entity9 was last known to have been alive , " it said			2
several of those interviewed said the former student was on a school bus en route to a state tournament in @entity86 , @entity5 , the day @entity9 disappeared			0
others could not say for sure			0
however , there are inconsistent accounts about when the bus left the school			0
some of the current and former students told investigators the team left campus before 10 a.m. other students said the team left just before noon			0
the bus driver told investigators the team left at 12:30 p.m. , according to incident reports			0
according to a school bus schedule provided to @entity21 by an attorney for the school , the bus left for the tournament at 4 p.m. , hours after @entity9 was last seen alive around 1:30 p.m. the wrestling coach told investigators the school bus schedule was inaccurate , as it reflected a request made by him at the beginning of the wrestling season , and not the time the bus left on the actual day of the wrestling meet			2
analysis of the coach 's cell phone bill showed the last call that accessed a tower in the @entity12 area that day occurred at 11:28 a.m. at 1:53 p.m. , the phone accessed a tower in @entity121 , @entity5 , nearly 90 miles outside of @entity12			0
an employee at @entity123 in @entity86 told investigators the coach checked in for the team at 4 p.m. , according to incident reports			0
one student told investigators that the weigh - in for the team began at 4 p.m. , according incident reports			0
according to a document included in the investigative file , the former student participated in the weigh - in on january 10 , but when that weigh - in occurred is not indicated			0
previously released documents showed that the former student and his brother were advised by their attorney in 2013 not to speak to investigators or provide them any statements			0
in august , the brothers ' parents filed a $ 5 million libel lawsuit in federal court against the publishers of @entity144 and writer @entity145			0
the suit claims stories written by @entity145 and published in @entity144 and on @entity144 imply that the brothers played a part in @entity9 's death and their father was involved in a conspiracy to cover it up			2
the claim that the brothers played any part in the death " is completely untrue , " according to the lawsuit			0
the interviews come more than 18 months after @entity15 closed its investigation into @entity9 's death			1
@entity161 's office investigators concluded @entity9 got stuck while reaching for a shoe at the center of the rolled mat. the state medical examiner determined @entity9 died as the result of accidental " positional asphyxia			1
" @entity9 's parents , @entity169 and @entity170 , believe the story about the shoe is a cover - up and that their son was murdered			2
a forensic pathologist hired by @entity9 's family later found evidence of " unexplained , apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma " to the neck			1
he concluded @entity9 's death was the result of a homicide			1
a federal investigation into @entity9 's death , launched more than a year ago , continues			1
the @entity181 has taken possession of the gym mat where @entity9 's body was found , according to the records released by the sheriff 's office to @entity21			1
last month , the approximately 6 - foot gym mat was rolled in brown paper and loaded into a vehicle driven by assistant u.s. attorney @entity191 and @entity194 attorney 's @entity192 , according to the documents			1
federal authorities also reviewed evidence being stored as part of the case and were given copies of three discs with audio recordings of calls for service made the day @entity9 's body was found and two discs with video surveillance .			2
