-- the death of @entity3 leader @entity2 , who was killed thursday in his hometown of @entity5 , @entity3 , is " an important step " for @entity3 , but do n't expect the fighting to end right away , said @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity8			1
@entity8 , the first @entity9 television reporter to enter and report from inside @entity3 during the war , talked about how @entity2 's life ended and what his death means for @entity3 's future and the civil war			1
q : there are reports that @entity2 was hiding in a hole , possibly a sewer or drainage ditch , like former @entity23 leader @entity22 before he was captured			2
it does n't seem like @entity2 's m.o. what do you make of this ? @entity8 : we understood when he left @entity30 in august that he left with a large entourage , with lots of cash ... and a lot of weapons			1
and for him to end up basically in the same sort of spider hole that @entity22 did seems a bit odd , a bit out of character			0
when i was there , we were hearing all sorts of reports : that he was in @entity45 -- that was the explanation for the level of resistance there -- that he was in an oasis in the southern part of the country , and that he could be in @entity5			0
so it 's a bit of a surprise the way he , in theory , met his end			2
he was not somebody that people expected to really go this early			0
let 's not forget that @entity66 , for instance , in the case of @entity23 , it fell in late april ( 2003 ) ( and ) @entity22 was not caught until december of 2003			0
it was expected that @entity2 could be able to hold out a bit longer than this			2
q : what does @entity2 's reported death mean to his loyalists , those fighting the @entity75 ? and how will the @entity75 fill the power vacuum left behind by @entity2 , who ruled @entity3 for 42 years ? @entity8 : i think perhaps his role as a leader of the @entity81 insurgency may have been somewhat overstated			1
i was in parts of @entity3 where i spoke to lots of people who were opposed to the new rulers of @entity3 , but not necessarily great supporters of @entity2			1
there is a worry that this new regime in @entity3 will be very slow , if ( they ) succeed at all , in moving to democracy			2
there 's a worry that there 's going to be a lot of revenge , a lot of , basically , lawlessness			0
some of the times when we were told that these were @entity2 loyalists fighting for the leader , it was wrong			0
they were actually people defending their homes , afraid that their homes would be looted , and we have seen instances where looting has been a serious problem			0
so @entity2 ... was a rallying point for a certain element of the opponents of the new regime in @entity3			1
but he was n't necessarily leading all of them			0
q : does that mean you think those loyal to @entity2 will continue to fight even after his death ? @entity8 : we have to realize this has been a complete change of regime , and many of these people ( in the @entity75 ) have no experience running the country			1
yes , it 's an important step along the way , but the killing of @entity2 certainly does n't mean that it 's going to be smooth sailing			1
i mean , all you have to do is look around ( @entity3 ) : @entity130 , the revolution ( took ) only 18 days -- and months , months and months later , it 's still a very unstable and uncertain place			1
@entity3 has certain elements working in its favor : a smaller population , a better educated population , lots in the way of natural resources			0
but no , just because @entity2 is gone -- we believe -- does n't mean things are going to be rosy from here on in			2
let 's not forget even in @entity23 -- and there are huge differences -- the first few months after the fall of @entity22 were relatively quiet			0
it 's when the new people in power start to exercise that power at every level of society , things can get complicated			0
there 's been a lot of talk about tribal differences ( in @entity3 ) we have n't really seen that play out ... but i would not in any sense bet my bottom dollar that @entity3 will be smooth sailing now that @entity2 is dead .			1
