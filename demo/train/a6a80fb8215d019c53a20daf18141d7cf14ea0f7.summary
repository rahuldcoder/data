" the @entity60 advises that when flight crew members encounter a passenger with symptoms that they suspect could be @entity1 , such as fever and bleeding , that they keep the sick person away from other passengers			1
they 've been instructed to wear disposable gloves and to provide the sickened person with a surgical mask to prevent fluids from spreading through talking , sneezing or coughing			2
