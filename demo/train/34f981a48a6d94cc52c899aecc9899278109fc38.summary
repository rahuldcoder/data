it 's fairly clear the federal investigation into @entity2 wo n't be a duplication of the grand jury probe that led to charges of more than 50 counts of child sex abuse against @entity8			1
instead , federal authorities seem to be stepping into areas where the state attorney general 's office has n't gone			1
this time , they seem to be exploring the possibility of a cover - up at @entity2 , as well as possible bribes , fraud , or misuse of federal money , according to three former federal prosecutors asked to independently review the subpoena @entity2 received february 2			1
and on the case is one of the most experienced and respected assistant @entity24 attorneys in the region , @entity26			0
the subpoena asks for : -- payments made by university board members to third parties			2
-- records of complaints , interviews or out - of - court settlements regarding @entity8 , a former coach at the university			1
-- correspondence with @entity8 's children 's charity , @entity39			1
" if you thought there might be a cover - up , these are the type of documents you might want to get to know , one way or another , " said @entity41 , a former assistant @entity24 attorney and current professor at @entity43 in @entity44			1
" the subpoena appears to be exploring when or whether there was any institutional awareness of @entity8 's alleged conduct at @entity2 , " said @entity54 , a @entity44 lawyer and former federal prosecutor			1
" if , for example , there were private efforts by board members to settle claims before the matter became public , or there were reports to the board about the allegations , it could change the nature of the investigation			0
" already , state prosecutors have charged two former @entity2 officials with not doing enough when a report was brought to them in 2002 by an assistant football coach who said he 'd allegedly witnessed something inappropriate in a locker room shower on campus			1
the moral obligations of others have been questioned			0
but those charges involve inaction , rather than an overt cover - up			1
this federal investigation appears to be going deeper			2
" at this point , they do n't have to have proof , just a theory , " said @entity85 , another former federal prosecutor now in private law practice			2
" they 're trying to prove or disprove the theory			0
" while gov. @entity93 said in two recent television interviews that @entity39 is n't under investigation by the state — although his staff says he was speaking in past tense and meant " was n't " — the federal subpoena is specifically looking at issues related to the charity where it 's alleged @entity8 met almost all of his 10 accusers			1
@entity104 , the high - profile @entity105 lawyer hired to represent @entity2 in the wake of the @entity8 scandal , declined to comment on where the investigation might be going			1
" we do n't speculate on what prosecutors might be interested in , we just cooperate , " @entity104 said			2
each year , educational institutions such as @entity2 receive million of dollars in federal money earmarked for certain areas such as defense or medical research and educational programs			1
if that money was used for other purposes , that could be a federal crime , @entity85 said			2
" i 'm sure they get all sorts of federal funding that flows into large state university 's like that , " he said			1
" as part of that sort of grant or funding , you have to certify those funds will only be used for the certain things			0
that could be why they 'd be looking into interactions with @entity39 and @entity2			1
" fraud could be a possibility if false statements were made to an agency such as the @entity141 , @entity85 said			0
something like , " we do n't have any unauthorized persons using the training facilities			0
" @entity2 has said that , as part of his retirement agreement , @entity8 kept an office and a key to the @entity2 locker room			1
@entity8 left his coaching job as @entity152 's defensive coordinator after the 1999 season			1
he was asked , after the 2002 incident , not to bring children with him to the facilities , but university officials testified before a grand jury that the ban was unenforceable			0
if @entity2 did n't disclose that to an agency who asked for such information , that could constitute fraud			2
" the @entity141 might say , ' we would never have allowed them to go to a bowl ... or get certain funding , ' " @entity85 said			0
there 's also the possibility of hush money			0
" if they somehow diverted funds to keep victims , or others in the know quiet , " @entity85 said , " they might be trying to figure out if that happened			0
... that would explain why they 'd ask if trustees have ever made payments on behalf of university			0
" all these things requested in the subpoenas — e-mails , complaints , payments — all point to an investigation that might have little to do with the alleged victims , @entity41 said			0
" that looks much more like the back end — how did the university react to what @entity8 had ( allegedly ) done ? " she said			2
" not investigating what @entity8 had done			2
... this is more about the university and @entity39			0
" when contacted , several people close to the alleged victims named in the state grand jury presentments against @entity8 said they had not been contacted or interviewed by federal investigators			1
those close to the defense for former athletic director @entity202 and vice president @entity203 — both charged with failing to report the 2002 incident , then lying to a state grand jury about it — said the pair has not been subpoenaed			0
@entity8 's attorney had no direct knowledge of the probe			1
the @entity39 charity and a lawyer for the late head coach @entity152 received requests for documents and are cooperating without a subpoena , sources say			1
at this stage of the investigation , however , that 's not unusual , the experts said			0
" this is definitely the first step , " @entity41 said			0
" the first thing that happens is the prosecution sends out a subpoena for all the documents they can find and then start in on key witnesses			2
" the state grand jury continues to meet on the @entity8 case , a spokesman for the attorney general 's office said , even after two presentments have led to multiple charges against @entity8			1
because grand juries meet in secret , prosecutors ca n't talk about what topics they are exploring			0
however , @entity93 said publicly there is no indication @entity39 is under investigation			0
he also publicly defended his decision to accept more than $ 25,000 in campaign donations from current members of @entity39 board while running for governor			0
that number balloons to $ 200,000 when former members are included			0
@entity93 also received about $ 38,000 directly from current members of the @entity2 board of trustees .			2

documents may shed light on whether there was a cover - up , they say
