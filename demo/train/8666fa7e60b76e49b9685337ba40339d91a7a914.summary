-- a consortium of wealthy city businessmen is poised to make an audacious takeover bid for @entity5 champions @entity4			1
the self - styled " @entity15 " issued a statement on tuesday to confirm that they had held talks about ousting the current @entity10 owners , the @entity12 family , to assume control at @entity14			1
the @entity15 include @entity16 , the chief economist at @entity17 , who is reportedly a friend of @entity4 manager @entity18			0
" we can confirm that a group of high net worth individuals , who support @entity4 met in @entity23 yesterday , " a statement released on behalf of the @entity15 read			1
" this group is supportive of current management but are looking at the feasibility of putting together a proposal to be put to the @entity12 family regarding the ownership of @entity4			1
" these discussions are in early stages and no contact has been made with the @entity12 family			1
" the @entity15 are joining forces with the influential @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , who have mounted a vociferous campaign against the @entity12 over their debt leveraged buyout of the club and fears about its future viability			1
the current level of debt stands at $ 1,089 million and the @entity12 recently launched a bond issue to raise $ 750 million to reduce the debt			2
football floats on a sea of debt " as a first step , the @entity15 want supporters to demonstrate their commitment by joining the free online membership of the @entity33 , @entity51 , " the statement went on			2
" any new ownership model would aim not only to put the club on a sound financial footing , but would also aim to put the supporters at the heart of everything the club does			0
" in recent weeks a groundswell of opinion has built up against the @entity12 , who are rarely seen in public but did attend the @entity63 final at @entity64 on sunday as @entity4 beat @entity65 2 - 1			1
they would have seen a large body of fans donning the original green and gold shirts of @entity4 's founding club @entity70 , one of the trademarks of the @entity33 campaign			2
@entity75 , a vice-chairman of @entity33 , told @entity76 that the @entity15 had their unequivocal backing and that his group had been involved in a series of meetings with them			2
" these guys are @entity4 supporters to the core and they are talking about putting in their own money in any possible bid , " he said			0
@entity75 admitted that the @entity15 are at the " early stages " but had appointed a team of lawyers and advisers to bolster their activities			0
" we are talking about the long term health and sustainability of @entity4 , " he added			0
but the @entity15 will need to raise at least $ 1.52 billion to launch a buyout of the most successful club in the @entity5 , @entity96 from @entity97 told @entity76			0
the @entity12 reacted quickly to news of the putative bid			0
" @entity4 is not for sale , " said a spokesman for the family , who also own the @entity103 side @entity102			2
the statement of intent by the @entity15 comes on the day that the latest football " rich list " , compiled by @entity108 , found that @entity4 had slipped to third place behind @entity112 giants @entity113 and @entity114			0
@entity113 top rich list the list excludes transfer fees and is based on turnover and income and @entity4 's slippage to third can , in part , be explained by the fall of the @entity124 pound against the euro			0
real and @entity114 also benefit from negotiating their own television rights package while @entity4 are tied into the collective deal put in place by the @entity5 , but the statistics could give added justification for a takeover bid .			1

' @entity138 ' are *unhappy* about the level of debt built up the @entity12 family to buy @entity4
the group are forming an alliance with the @entity33
