@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 on tuesday rejected a @entity4 call to resign , telling a heated @entity6 hearing that @entity4 were trying to score political points instead of addressing significant issues			1
under attack from the outset by @entity4 members of the @entity12 , @entity2 rejected accusations he was stonewalling congressional investigators on the botched " @entity15 " gunrunning sting operation and failing to investigate recent leaks of classified information properly			1
sen. @entity19 , @entity20 , leveled the harshest criticism , accusing @entity2 of misleading @entity22 over what he and other top @entity24 officials knew about the @entity15 program and refusing to appoint a special counsel to investigate leaked national security details in recent media reports			1
@entity2 rested his head on one hand as @entity19 recited a litany of allegations involving the attorney general 's performance			1
" i 'm afraid we 've come to an impasse , " @entity19 said , adding that @entity2 " violated the public trust " in his view			1
" with regret , you 've left me with no choice but to join those who call for you to resign your office			0
" @entity2 responded by calling @entity19 's list of allegations " almost breathtaking in its inaccuracy " and said : " i do n't have any intention of resigning			1
" @entity51 spokesman @entity50 said monday that president @entity52 maintains " absolute confidence " in the attorney general , which @entity2 noted tuesday			1
regarding congressional demands for @entity15 documents , including a @entity51 committee that plans to take up a contempt measure against @entity2 next week , the attorney general said good - faith efforts to work with the @entity51 panel have failed to reach a deal			1
" the desire here is not for accommodation but for political point - making , " @entity2 said , calling such behavior " the thing that turns people off about @entity0			2
" in what appeared to be a coordinated move , republicans , led by sen. @entity73 of @entity74 , introduced a resolution tuesday supporting the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the classified leaks			1
@entity73 : @entity52 responsible for leaks at the @entity12 hearing , @entity4 senators said @entity2 's decision to appoint two @entity84 attorneys to investigate , rather than a special counsel , failed to address the seriousness of the violations and represented a @entity89 double standard			1
the issue sparked angry exchanges between senators , with chairman @entity92 of @entity93 and sen. @entity94 of @entity95 , both @entity89 , taking issue with arguments by @entity19 and sen. @entity98 , @entity100 - @entity99 , that @entity2 was acting improperly			1
in response to @entity89 support for @entity2 on the classified leaks investigation , @entity98 shot back : " if the shoe was on the other foot , you and everyone else on the other side would be crying to high heaven to appoint a special prosecutor that all of us could buy into			1
" @entity98 noted that as senators , @entity52 and vice president @entity112 had called for the appointment of a special counsel in past situations that involved @entity4 transgressions , such as @entity51 leaks in the @entity119 case that revealed the identity of the @entity122 operative			1
@entity6 breaks filibuster of @entity52 court pick the current leaks were more serious , @entity98 argued , and @entity2 should do now what @entity52 and @entity112 had called for then			1
however , sen. @entity127 , @entity128 , who chairs the @entity129 and is a member of the judiciary panel , repeated her past contention that a special counsel 's investigation would take too long to deal with the immediate threat from classified leaks			1
she said she would oppose the @entity73 resolution , adding that @entity2 took the right step in naming two @entity84 attorneys to investigate in addition to the @entity141 probe already under way			2
@entity2 told the committee that both he and fbi director @entity144 had been interviewed " because we were people who had knowledge of these matters , and we wanted to make sure that with regard to the investigation , that it began with us			2
" describing his experience as " a serious interview that was done by some serious @entity141 agents , " @entity2 said he believed about 100 interviews had been conducted so far			0
@entity2 earlier offered to negotiate with congressional leaders on turning over documents involving @entity15 to avoid what he said could become a constitutional crisis			1
he later modified his characterization of the problem to a possible constitutional conflict			0
" i am prepared to make compromises with regard to the documents to be made available , " @entity2 said			0
at the same time , @entity2 said congressional republicans must be open to working out an agreement			0
" i 've got to have a willing partner , " @entity2 said			0
" i 've extended my hand , and i 'm waiting to hear back			0
" the @entity170 will consider the contempt measure against @entity2 on june 20 , a panel statement said monday			1
a vote by the panel could occur that day , and the measure would then require approval from the full chamber			0
monday 's announcement escalated a high - stakes , election - year face - off over what @entity4 said is @entity2 's failure to respond to a subpoena for @entity24 documents on the botched operation			2
could @entity22 go from bad to worse ? the department has acknowledged the program , which allowed illegally purchased guns to " walk " across the border into @entity191 , was badly flawed			0
such sting operations have now been prohibited			0
the department 's @entity193 , which lost track of more than 1,000 firearms after they crossed the border , found itself under fire when two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the killing of @entity84 @entity202 agent @entity15 in december 2010			0
@entity15 's family has been among critics of the @entity24 's handling of the case			0
on tuesday , sen. @entity207 , @entity208 , raised the matter in his opening statement and again in direct questioning of @entity2 , noting that questions remain almost a year after three whistle - blowers testified before the @entity170 and @entity214 about gunrunning			2
" here we are , one year later , and the @entity203 is still waiting for answers			0
they 're still waiting for justice , " @entity207 said , noting assertions by @entity219 that sealed requests for wiretaps under the @entity15 program showed top @entity24 officials knew about the questionable operation long before so far acknowledged			1
@entity2 repeated what he told a @entity228 last week -- that he read the affidavits and summaries and found no incriminating information			0
" you reach conclusions on the basis of hindsight , " @entity2 said			0
" i try to put myself in the place of people actually looking at the material at the time			0
" @entity2 has testified at eight congressional hearings on @entity15 , and he has consistently maintained that he knew nothing about the flawed tactics until early last year			2
the chairman of the @entity170 , rep. @entity243 , @entity244 , said monday that the panel wants documents that explain why @entity2 and the @entity24 decided months later to retract a february 4 , 2011 , letter to @entity22 that denied any knowledge by senior officials of improper tactics in the gunrunning sting			2
the @entity24 slammed the @entity228 's monday announcement , calling it " unfortunate and unwarranted			0
" " from the beginning , chairman @entity243 has distorted the facts , ignored testimony and flung inaccurate accusations at the attorney general and others , and this latest move fits within that tired political playbook that has so many @entity84 disillusioned with @entity0 , " said spokeswoman @entity253			2
both @entity243 and the @entity24 statement said a resolution still could be reached to avoid the contempt measure			2
last week , @entity2 assigned @entity265 , @entity84 attorney for the @entity0 and a @entity89 appointee , and @entity268 , @entity84 attorney for the @entity269 and a holdover @entity4 appointee , to lead the investigations into the alleged leaks			1
@entity73 and other republicans are insisting on a special counsel , contending that investigators within the system would face a conflict of interest in pursuing top government officials			0
a recent report in the @entity281 provided classified details of what it described as a @entity84 cyberattack targeting @entity287 's nuclear centrifuge program sparked the bipartisan outrage			0
other recent possible leaks of classified information included details on the administration 's efforts to expand its drone program and @entity52 's involvement in " kill lists " against militants in @entity298 and @entity299			2
the public airing of details surrounding a recently disrupted bomb plot in @entity298 by @entity303 also angered intelligence and national security officials			0
republicans noted that some articles cited sources who took part in @entity51 meetings , which they said showed that leaks were coming from administration officials			2
sen. @entity313 , @entity74 , repeatedly asked @entity2 how two @entity84 attorneys could effectively investigate top national security issues involved in @entity51 meetings cited			1
@entity2 insisted the attorneys he named were dogged prosecutors who would follow any lead , no matter where it took them			0
@entity52 has strongly rejected claims that his @entity51 has deliberately leaked secrets to the media , saying the idea was " offensive " and would put @entity84 at risk			0
@entity98 , however , said tuesday that the pattern of the administration was to be uncooperative on issues that might embarrass it -- such as @entity15 and now the classified leaks			1
@entity2 responded the administration has prosecuted classified leaks more than any previous administration			1
@entity1 's @entity332 and @entity333 contributed to this report .			0
