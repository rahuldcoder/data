-- @entity1 is one of the legends of men 's tennis , holding the record of 286 weeks as world no. 1 -- a position he maintained for an unprecedented six years in a row			1
the @entity9 sat down for a chat with @entity0 's @entity12 host @entity11 , who like @entity1 is a former @entity13 champion			1
@entity1 was still a boy when @entity11 won his only grand slam crown in 1987 , but went on to notch a record seven championships at the @entity18 grass - court event and 14 majors overall -- which was a record until @entity21 beat it in 2009			1
@entity1 , now 40 , has been retired from top - level tennis for almost a decade , and has two sons with actress wife @entity24			1
he talks about his post-playing days , his record - breaking achievements , the state of the men 's game and why the @entity9 ca n't expect to dominate tennis anymore			1
on life after tennis : " i 've been into golf , trying to get into the gym to stay somewhat fit			1
i 've got two boys now , they 're active kids			2
" retirement is a work in progress			2
i try to figure out my day , and what i know about myself is that i need structure			2
i ca n't just wake up and watch tv and do nothing			2
i need a day off working out , seeing the wife , play a little golf , see my kids			1
" i 've worked hard my whole life , since i was a little kid			2
but now it 's a point in my life now where i can just enjoy it , but at the same time i still need to work			1
" on his post-retirement exhibition clashes with @entity21 in 2007 and 2008 : " it was pretty intense			2
when we signed up to do it , the last thing i wanted to do was play horrible and embarrass myself			2
i wanted to be respectful			2
" @entity21 was really good , and he 's a great guy ... i felt pretty comfortable , i was only 35 at the time , so i was still playing pretty good tennis , but i think the most important thing is that i really got to know @entity21			1
" he 's such a nice guy , good family man			1
he 's quick and he 's really good and he 's got all the shots and he 's a great player , but i just wanted to make sure i did n't make myself look like an idiot			1
i wanted to play well and i felt like i did that			0
" on the state of the men 's game : " to have @entity21 and @entity68 playing -- and @entity69 has now been the dominant player and @entity70 's getting closer -- it 's a great time for tennis , an interesting year			1
is there a guy coming through who is going to to dethrone those guys ? i do n't think so			0
@entity76 , @entity77 ? yeah , they have their moments up to that level , but i think it 's a little bit like the ' 80s with @entity83 and @entity84 -- those guys played each other all the time , and we 're seeing that today			1
" i love watching @entity21 and @entity68 play			0
i mean the lefty and the righty , the grinder against @entity21 , who is classic ... @entity69 being a great athlete ... i 'm a huge fan of all those guys			0
" on @entity9 's lack of successors to @entity95 , @entity83 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and himself : " it was a freaky time , it really was , and for @entity9 fans and media to expect it every 10 years ... let 's be realistic			1
it 's unfair to @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
they are really good players but they 're nowhere near @entity21 and @entity68 and @entity69			0
" to get to where i was with @entity96 and @entity97 and @entity98 , it might take another 10 , 20 years			1
i think the world has got a little bit stronger , a little bit better			0
guys are pretty hungry out there ... the game has gotten bigger , more people are playing the sport around the world			0
" @entity9 have been a little content , maybe a little soft			1
it 's just not happening at the moment			1
it seems like @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , they 're like major stars in our country and it seems like tennis has died down a little bit			1
i do n't see anything changing anytime soon			0
the @entity9 media and fans expect @entity13 winners , guys being number one -- it 's pretty hard to do			1
" on the dying art of serve and volley : " it 's gone			1
i mean you ( @entity11 ) , @entity144 , @entity145 , you were the guys that i grew up watching play , so i just developed this serve and volley game at a young age			0
you have to start young			0
i started at 13 , 14 -- if you 're 20 and do n't serve and volley , it 's too late			1
" and seeing you play @entity13 , seeing @entity153 ( @entity154 ) play @entity13 , it impacted on me -- if i was to win @entity13 , i needed to get into the net			0
i decided to serve and volley and do it as a young kid , and at first it was difficult			0
i love watching @entity21 , @entity68 , @entity69 but it 's sad to see @entity13 today with everyone staying back			1
" technology might be an issue because with these big @entity164 rackets , they do n't need to volley , you just hit the crap out of the ball			0
whereas we grew up with the wood racket , so you had to hit it properly			0
it 'd be nice to have someone come up that serves and volleys			0
it 's definitely a lost art , and it 's unfortunate			1
" on the @entity180 's 2011 rookie of the year @entity179 , widely tipped to be the next @entity1 : " huge serve , huge second serve			1
but again , he 's not really looking to get in , he 's looking to serve big and crack it and then get in			1
the feel is n't quite there with him , but he does n't need to do it when you serve so big			0
" it 's a timing thing , it takes a certain rhythm , practice			1
( players ) like @entity179 or @entity77 , @entity76 , they serve big , but they 're not willing to get into the net on their serve			0
i 'm a fan of all these guys , but serve and volley tennis , unfortunately , has pretty much gone			1
" on bowing out at the top by winning the @entity197 , his final tournament : " i broke the ( grand slam ) record when i was 29 -- i went through the next two years trying to find motivation			1
i just felt week in week out i did n't have it in me anymore , i just wanted to win one more major			2
i switched coaches , did n't really work out very well with that			0
i went back to @entity205 over the summer , and i just knew i had the game , i just needed to put it together and play that last @entity208			0
" it was raining a lot that first week , so i had to win five matches in seven days at 31 -- a lot of work at the @entity208			0
to beat @entity96 ( @entity96 ) at the end was a great ending			0
quite honestly , i was n't planning on retiring , but once @entity13 came and went for me , i knew i was done -- my heart was n't in it			2
i did n't want to practice , i did n't want to play any tennis			2
" but it was a great way to end it			0
it was n't really my plan , and from being as low as i could be -- losing second round at @entity13 against ( world no. 145 ) @entity223 , i was like almost in tears -- to come through two months later ... " on being no. 1 , beating @entity95 ' record of five successive years at the top of the rankings , and passing @entity229 's mark of 12 grand slams in 2000 " the no. 1 was a big deal for me -- six years in a row			1
i played in @entity234 for about two months to do it			0
that was huge for me , that 's a big record			2
to beat @entity229 at @entity13 with my parents there , beating @entity241 , a great @entity242 , it was great way to do it			0
it was 9 o'clock at night , it was a storybook ending , quite an emotional time for me			0
" so yeah , it was all about being no. 1 and winning majors , that was my goal , and i created a certain lifestyle to really create that			0
i was very focused , very single - minded			1
i just needed to be a certain way as far as my personality , so i felt i wanted to win majors and break some records and be world no. 1 as long as i could			0
" on being a father : " right now they are nine and six			0
they are great kids , i love them			0
i want them to listen a little better , i want them to do their homework and not give me a hard time and do what i say			0
i 'm taking it in small steps , but i 'm not sure they are going to be into tennis			2
i got them doing tennis lessons every week , and i have them doing golf lessons every weekend , just to try keep them active , get them out of the house			2
" we live in a day and age of a lot of computers , @entity278 , and @entity279 -- so much technology -- so i want to get them out of the house			0
i just want them to be good kids , respectful kids , be nice to people			0
if they play tennis great , if not , i 'm okay with that			2
