-- it 's not over in @entity2 , @entity3			1
although a judge has found two @entity2 teenagers guilty of raping a 16 - year - old girl in a case that showcased jaw - dropping examples of teenage alcohol use and tawdry text messaging -- all wrapped in allegations of a cover - up -- @entity3 's attorney general said monday it 's now time for a grand jury to look at whether anyone else should be charged			1
" i think the @entity2 community needs really two things			1
one is to get this over with , " attorney general @entity19 said in a nod to frustration the continued investigation is likely to cause in the city -- a small , down - on - its - luck @entity25 mill town that 's been the focus of intense criticism and media coverage for months			1
" but the other is to believe that justice has been done , that we have left no stone unturned and that anyone who is criminally liable has been brought to justice , " he said			0
healing process after rape never ends the victim 's mother told @entity0 that the verdicts are " the start of a new beginning for my daughter			1
" but she added , " we need to stress the importance of helping those in need and to stand up for what is right			0
" " we hope that from this something good can arise , " she said			0
" i feel i have an opportunity to bring an awareness to others , possibly change the mentality of a youth or help a parent to have more of an awareness to where their children are and what they are doing			2
the adults need to take responsibility and guide these children			1
" but the emotions inflamed by the case echoed past sunday 's verdict , with sheriff 's deputies and state investigators arresting two teenage girls monday for threatening the victim over @entity72			1
the girls -- one 15 , one 16 , both from @entity2 -- were in a juvenile lockup monday night , awaiting an appearance before a judge tuesday morning , @entity74 @entity73 said			1
grand jury @entity19 said state investigators have examined tens of thousands of text messages , images and videos and talked to 56 witnesses -- from teenagers who attended the parties to assistant football coaches and the high school principal			1
but 16 people who may know something about what happened that august night have refused to talk , he said			0
" i have reached the conclusion that this investigation can not be completed -- that we can not bring finality to this matter -- without the convening of a grand jury , " he said in a statement sunday			1
opinion : @entity2 case shows how the rules have changed the grand jury will begin meeting around april 15 and could take " a number of days " to complete its work , @entity19 said			1
" and i should point out that the convening of a grand jury , of course , does not necessarily mean that indictments will be returned or that charges will be filed , " he said			1
" a grand jury is an investigative tool that is uniquely suited to ensure fairness and to complete this investigation , " @entity19 said in the sunday statement			1
" and this community needs assurance that no stone has been left unturned in our search for the truth			0
" guilty verdicts @entity19 's announcement of the grand jury came shortly after judge @entity124 found @entity125 , 17 , and @entity126 , 16 , guilty of rape			1
@entity124 , who was hearing the case without a jury , also found @entity125 guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor			2
authorities accused @entity125 and @entity134 of putting their fingers in the girl 's vagina while she was too drunk to consent , an act that constitutes rape under @entity3 law			2
the incident took place during a series of alcohol - fueled end - of - summer parties in august			0
some of the abuse was documented in photographs shown in court and in texts read aloud during testimony , including one text in which a state forensics investigator testified @entity125 wrote , " i should have raped since everyone thinks i did			0
" trial focuses on text messages @entity124 sentenced @entity125 to a minimum of two years in a juvenile correctional facility			0
@entity134 received a minimum of one year			0
juvenile authorities could decide to keep both in custody until they turn 21			0
@entity134 's father , @entity163 , said he still believed his son was innocent " even though he apologized in the courtroom			2
" " the evidence they had against @entity126 was minimal , " he told @entity0 's " @entity169			2
" " @entity126 was just at the wrong place at the wrong time			2
i know my son is not a rapist , even though he has been convicted of rape			0
" both @entity125 and @entity134 must undergo treatment and will have to register as sex offenders , @entity124 ruled			0
@entity134 's attorney , @entity177 , said his client would appeal in an attempt to avoid that designation			2
meanwhile , the victim and her family remain under guard after the threats were posted online , @entity73 told @entity0			1
" she continues to be a victim and be victimized ... over and over , " he said			2
" and that 's what 's sad			2
" one of the tweets that led to monday 's arrests warned that if the poster saw the victim , " it 's gone be a homicide			1
" another threatened a beating			0
the girl accused of tweeting the death threat turned herself in after learning that investigators were looking for her , the sheriff said			2
nevertheless , " they 're going to have to answer to it , " he said			0
" we 're dealing with kids , again , " @entity73 said			0
" but the attorney general had just left the building -- the judge was still in the building -- when i received messages that there 's death threats already against the victim			1
" no charges had been announced against the suspects monday night , but " there 's no question they 're going to prosecute			1
" " i hope this sends a warning , " he said			0
" and i can assure you , we 've been monitoring @entity72 for 24 hours and continue to			1
if there 's anybody else there crosses a line and makes a death threat , they 're going to have to face the consequences			2
" internet outrage the case received widespread attention after a blogger who once lived in @entity2 uncovered some of the materials posted to social media sites			1
the blogger , @entity237 , wrote pointedly about the possibility that the teenagers had been given preferential treatment because they played on the town 's highly regarded football team			1
police have denied that claim			0
later , the loosely organized hacker group @entity245 got involved , posting a lengthy video in which another teenager -- who has not been charged -- made joking references to the rape			0
the ensuing ire over the case brought national attention and criticism to the city from around the country , leaving city officials struggling to defend the community and residents weary of the media spotlight			0
teen rape trial shines unwelcome spotlight on @entity3 town broader problem acknowledging the town 's frustration , @entity19 said monday that it would be a mistake to focus on one small @entity3 community , to think something unique in its culture is behind the incident			1
" i 'm afraid people are going to walk away and say this was all about @entity2 , " @entity19 said			1
it 's a cultural problem			0
" " i 'll guarantee that there are crimes very similar to this that occur every friday night and every saturday night in communities across this country where you have people , particularly young people , who are drinking too much and a girl is taken advantage of , and a girl is raped , " he said			0
such incidents stem from a larger social problem -- a rampant lack of respect and human decency , he said			0
" one of the lessons of life is we have to take care of each other , and we have to try to help people and we have to do what 's right			0
" and there were precious few people that night that were doing what was right			0
" teens treated girl ' like a toy , ' prosecutor says @entity0 's @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this report .			2

" adults need to take responsibility and guide these children , " victim 's mother says
two @entity2 teens arrested after @entity72 threats to victim , sheriff says
prosecutors will ask a grand jury to investigate the possibility of *additional* charges
ag @entity19 says it would be wrong to blame @entity2 alone
