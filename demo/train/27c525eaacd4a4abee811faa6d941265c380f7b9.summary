@entity0 -- the longstanding bad blood between @entity3 and @entity4 in @entity5 boiled monday amid another round of attacks : the killing of 25 people and wounding of dozens more in five car bombings			1
four of the blasts occurred in the @entity4 heartland in the southern region of @entity5			1
two car bombs exploded near a busy outdoor market in @entity18 , killing 13 people and wounding 24 others			0
a bomb went off near an outdoor market in @entity23 , killing six people and wounding 20 others			0
and two people died and 11 others were wounded in a bombing at a commercial area in @entity30			0
another blast occurred in @entity32 , a predominantly @entity3 area just south of @entity0			1
four people were killed and 14 others were wounded in that attack			0
@entity5 pulls plug on ' misleading ' tv networks no one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks , nor was it clear whether they were related			2
but the fighting has prompted fears among @entity5 leaders and international powers that the tensions between @entity3 and @entity4 could escalate and bring a return of the full - blown sectarian war that raged last decade			1
since the overthrow of @entity52 's government last decade , @entity3 have been politically marginalized and @entity4 , who represent a majority of @entity5 , have emerged with more power			1
there have been protests for months by @entity3 against the @entity4 - led government and its prime minister , @entity58			2
the anger has escalated since a confrontation last week between police and protesters in @entity63			0
the @entity64 last week said that the " failure to integrate @entity3 into a genuinely representative political system in @entity0 risks turning @entity5 's domestic crisis into a broader regional struggle			1
" " the most urgent task today is to tamp down the flames , and the burden for this lies above all with the government , " the @entity71 - based think tank said in a report			0
" the country is at a crossroads , " said @entity78 , @entity79 special representative in @entity5 .			2

four of the five blasts occurred in the @entity4 heartland in the southern region of @entity5
another was in @entity32 , a predominantly @entity3 area just south of @entity0
no one immediately claims responsibility
@entity5 has seen an *uptick* in *violence* in recent months
