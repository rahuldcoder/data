-- @entity1 shed tears of joy friday morning			2
" it 's just insane , " the graduate student at @entity5 said			2
" i 've been working on this for six years			2
" @entity1 was electrified by news that the @entity11 administration will stop deporting illegal immigrants who entered the @entity13 as children if they meet certain requirements			1
@entity1 came to the @entity13 illegally from @entity16 at age 14 to find his mother , who was already in the country , he said			1
without the change announced friday , he could n't get a job to help pay for school ; @entity1 , 25 , is pursuing a master 's degree in education with hopes of earning a doctorate and teaching middle school			2
he also would n't be able to consider job offers that presented themselves afterward			2
the uncertainty over what loomed after graduation spooked him			2
" now , maybe i will be able to work without being afraid that someone may deport me , " he said			1
" there is no fear anymore			2
" immigration shift sparks reaction from both sides news of the change raced across the country , buoying the spirits of immigrants and immigrant advocates who have campaigned for such a change for more than 10 years			1
" i 'm definitely speechless , " said @entity47 , a recent graduate of @entity48 who was student body president when he admitted that he was in the country illegally			2
" it gives us a chance to show the @entity13 people that we 're not here to use your tax dollars ; we 're not here to take your jobs ; we 're here to contribute , " he said			1
not everyone viewed the change with such enthusiasm			2
" this is a classic @entity11 move of choosing politics over leadership , " sen. @entity61 , @entity63 - @entity62 , said on @entity64			2
" this decision avoids dealing with @entity69 and the @entity13 people instead of fixing a broken immigration system once and for all			1
" rep. @entity73 , @entity74 , said the decision would invite fraud and hurt unemployed @entity13			1
" president @entity11 's decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants is a breach of faith with the @entity13 people , " said @entity73 , chairman of the @entity76			1
@entity83 's memo here ( @entity85 ) under the new directives , those who were brought into the country illegally before the age of 16 and are not criminals , among other requirements , are eligible to receive deferred action for two years , and will be eligible to apply for work authorization			1
" it 's a step in the right direction , " @entity47 said , though he characterized it as a " @entity97 deal			0
" " it 's not the solution ; it 's a temporary fix			0
but it implements part of the key focal points of the @entity104 , " he said			0
the @entity105 -- or @entity106 -- @entity104 , would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the @entity13 illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the @entity13 for at least five years , obtained a high school or general education development diploma , and demonstrated " good moral character , " the @entity107 said			1
efforts to pass the @entity104 in @entity69 have failed			0
@entity117 , spokeswoman for the @entity118 , said the @entity11 administration is within its authority to enforce the change			0
" this is a legitimate use of the tools that the administration has to focus on their immigration enforcement resources , " she said			0
" in light of the congressional inaction on immigration reform , this is the right step for the administration to take at this time			0
" @entity129 , a spokesman for the @entity130 said the policy is politically motivated and misguided			0
what to know about immigration in the @entity13 " they 're going to throw 830,000 people into an already dismal work environment , " he said , referring to estimates of the number of people who could become eligible to apply for work authorization under the new policy			1
@entity129 said the law also disregards the authority of @entity69			0
" the president is basically announcing amnesty without authority from @entity69 , " he said			0
" this is what they need to rally a certain part of their base , but it 's going to come at the expense of a lot of other people who say this is bad policy and a usurpation of the authority of the legislative branch of @entity69 , " he said			1
in @entity166 , @entity164 sheriff @entity163 , known for his tough anti-illegal immigration stance , said that politics is behind the policy action			0
" why now ? why not let @entity69 decide next year on this issue and on all the illegal immigration problems we have ? " he said			1
@entity163 said he will abide by the directive , but added he will continue to enforce state laws as he sees fit			0
" we 're going to continue enforcing these illegal immigration laws , including the state laws , " he said			1
the new immigration directive could also help resolve immigration snafus that that system has created			0
@entity180 nearly missed her graduation and salutatorian speech because she was caught in one such mix - up			0
an undocumented immigrant who was brought to the @entity13 by her parents when she was 4 , @entity180 traveled to @entity186 , @entity187 , last month to beat a deadline to apply for a visa			1
but because of a miscalculation , she missed a deadline and risked being barred from the @entity13 for three years			1
it took a waiver to allow her to return to the @entity13 , where her father is a naturalized citizen			1
her attorney , @entity195 , said those who have grown up in the @entity13 after entering illegally did so without intent to violate the law			1
overheard on @entity0 : decision to defer some deportations symbolic " it 's not the end of the road , but it is great news , " she said of the administration 's announcement			0
" it will allow them to live without the fear looming over their head that they can be sent to their home country at any moment			0
" in downtown @entity219 , about 150 young demonstrators -- many of them undocumented immigrants -- rallied in front of the federal immigration office friday and exalted over the news from @entity223			1
some shed tears of joy and chanted , " undocumented , unafraid ! " demonstrators then symbolically blocked a freeway on - ramp and next obstructed @entity230 for about an hour to halt the movement of a fleet of @entity234 vans and buses , which are typically used to haul away illegal immigrants to the border for deportation			1
protestors then broke up peacefully			0
protest organizer @entity240 asserted that " there 's so many undocumented youth graduating from @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 " and the executive order will ensure " that they are going to be able to use their degree and work			1
" it 's a night and day change , and there 's hope , " @entity240 said			0
@entity254 , 20 , a senior at @entity48 , drove four hours to downtown @entity219 early friday to participate in the " historic moment , " he said			1
" i was brought here at the age of 3 ( from @entity187 ) and was raised in @entity257 , @entity258			0
i grew up here , this is my country and i have no intention of going back , " @entity254 said			0
" i want to come here and contribute , to be a teacher , educating young minds			2
that 's what i plan to do for the rest of my life			0
" photos : putting a face on the immigration debate @entity0 's @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			0
