they looked at 114 national dietary surveys covering more than 60 % of the world 's population			0
they also used evidence from studies published in medical journals that discussed sugary drinks and other dietary habits			0
their data was included in the 2010 @entity61 , which looks at the health and mortality of populations across the world			0

when the researchers controlled for these factors , they were able to determine what percentage of deaths from diabetes , heart disease and cancer were linked to sugary drinks			1
" the investigators examined changes in sugar - sweetened beverage consumption and then its association with change in body fatness or @entity107 ( body mass index ) , and subsequent deaths from cardiovascular disease , diabetes and cancer , " says @entity98 , professor of nutrition at the @entity100 in @entity101 and chair of the @entity104 's @entity103 , who was not involved in the study			1

" so this is not just a problem in wealthy nations			0
" the average consumption of sugar - sweetened beverages in @entity13 , the country with the highest death rates among larger nations , was 24 ounces per day			1
the @entity21 released this statement in response to the study : " this abstract , which is neither peer - reviewed nor published , is more about sensationalism than science			1
in no way does it show that consuming sugar - sweetened beverages causes chronic diseases such as diabetes , cardiovascular disease or cancer - the real causes of death among the studied subjects			2
