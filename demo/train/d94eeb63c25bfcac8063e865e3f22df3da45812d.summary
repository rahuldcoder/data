the shooting death of 17 - year - old @entity1 and its galvanizing effect on african - americans has often been compared to the 1955 lynching of @entity5			1
i have often resisted this comparison because it was what took place following @entity5 's death -- the @entity10 -- that made the death of the young man such a pivotal role in launching the civil rights movement			1
yet there is no denying that the death of @entity1 has moved this generation of african - americans in a way that we have not seen in a 40 years			1
this post-civil rights movement generation -- i am a member of it since i was born in november 1968 -- has often been reluctant to embrace a social justice agenda			0
instead , too many have had a me - myself - and - @entity27 mentality			2
very few issues have led this generation to say , " enough is enough ! " the @entity1 case may be that catalyst that i and others have often said is long overdue			1
many have asked , " well , what makes this case unique ? " to be honest , it 's as simple as a young kid walking home from the store with a bag of @entity41 and an iced tea , being seen as suspicious , and ending up dead			1
the legal system will sort out whether or not @entity44 was justified in shooting @entity1 , but that still does n't change the reality that a young man is dead			1
so , we have to seek ways to end racial profiling ; to end @entity51 's deadly obsession with guns ; to end the fear that people have toward one another			2
it has been amazing to watch as millions across the country weighed in on the tragedy , signing petitions , organizing rallies and vigils and demanding changes to the @entity64 law that some believe contributed to @entity1 's death			1
yes , there is anger and frustration			2
but nothing is wrong with folks being angry about @entity1 's death			1
during a recent interview with entertainer and humanitarian @entity75 for my @entity78 show , " @entity77 , " he said that even the rev. @entity79 recognized the benefit of anger in a social justice movement			1
" he said , ' we first need to be angry at our plight before we 'll act upon changing our condition , ' " @entity75 said			1
" so , anger is a necessary force			2
it 's not so much that you 're angry , it 's what you do with your anger that finally determines the importance of anger			1
" that 's why i vehemently disagree with my media colleagues who are quick to ask whether @entity44 's arrest will quell the voices of anger and satisfy protesters			2
an arrest is one thing ; having a jury and judge hear the evidence is another			0
everyone i know who has been up in arms over this case understands that it 's not about bounties , burning down buildings or lashing out at whites , @entity114 , police , prosecutors or anyone else			2
those advocating hateful actions have no place even being interviewed			0
they represent a minuscule population , but often overshadow and distract from those doing the real , substantive work			0
but it is clear that there is a need to change a system that only responds to protests and outrage			1
justice is supposed to be blind			0
but too often , especially for african - americans , the feeling is that justice works for others and not us			0
but if we 're going to see a true change in this nation when it comes to social justice and the legal system , it will have to be led by young people			2
it will be led by those college students who called themselves the " @entity145 ' in @entity64 who marched from @entity147 to @entity148 on @entity149 weekend saying they were doing to so reach dr. @entity79 's dream of a better @entity51			1
it is going to require a 21st - century @entity153 , the fearless , passionate and successful group that played a vital role in the civil rights movement , only to fall victim to more militant voices toward the end of the 1960s			0
this change in @entity51 will not take place only in the halls of the legislatures and @entity164			0
it is going to have to take place in towns , cities , communities and homes			0
it truly must be bottom up and not top down			0
@entity75 , who was an adviser and funder to @entity153 while also being a confidant to dr. @entity79 , said the only way we are going to see a truly changed @entity51 is if the nation 's young rise up in a moral army for good and righteousness			1
but he cautioned that it ca n't be exclusively the province of political leaders , which he says was a miscalculation of the civil rights movement			0
" we had to have young , bright men and women sitting in places that could legislate the branches of government ; that could write laws and become engaged , " he said			0
" and once we got them into the positions , we no longer had these people in the community servicing the growth and the counseling of @entity198 coming up			0
" the grassroots infrastructure became the political infrastructure			0
we 're now getting back to that , and i think we 're getting back to that in a very healthy way			0

@entity206 says he 's resisted comparing the @entity64 shooting to the @entity5 case
@entity10 came on the heels of that killing , he says
dr. @entity79 saw the value of well - directed anger , @entity75 noted
a system that only responds to protests and outrage should change , @entity1 says
