-- being a tech dad is a curse			0
we are always chasing the latest and greatest that tech minds are producing despite our economic status , how many kids we have or whether or not the cfo at home ( the wife ) will approve			1
we need to have it			0
we do n't want to wait			0
we do n't care what it costs			0
some gadgets are are more valuable than others -- to you personally and professionally			0
that 's why i think the @entity19 is a must - have for all parents			1
i firmly believe that it was secretly made with kids in mind			1
not only is the @entity19 a great tool for business needs , it 's also the secret weapon of parenting			1
other than the obvious -- games , education and creativity -- there 's a slew of reasons why i think the @entity19 was created for kids -- at least tech - tech loving adults with kids			1
reason # 1 : your kids are going to get on your nerves every parent has been there			2
you 're in a restaurant , out shopping or even chillin ' at home when your kid has a breakdown of sorts			0
they wo n't zip it up no matter what the heck you do or say			0
just when you 're about to flip your lid , bust out the @entity19			1
it 's like using duct tape to cover their mouths -- but legal of course			2
the secret weapon app in this case , of course , has to be " @entity65			1
" the very addictive game is simple for even your toddlers to play			0
my four year old is obsessed with " @entity65 " and even pressured my wife and me to get the plush toys			0
reason # 2 : they are bound to ask , " are we there yet ? " @entity77 car drives are the death of any parent 's sanity			1
if you 're lucky enough , your kids will pass out from the humming of the tires against the asphalt			2
however , when ( and i really mean when ) , your kid flies off the handle because they ca n't take another three hours before you get to @entity91 's house , bust out the @entity19 and get back to the tranquility of wheels on asphalt			1
in terms of car - ride @entity19 savers , i 'd have to suggest the instant classic " @entity99 , " " @entity100 " or " @entity101			1
" reason # 3 : they always want you to read them a book at the most inopportune time kids love books			1
what 's not cool is when it 's your time to put the little rascals to bed and they want you to read a book as you 're watching the game			1
of course , when you say , " go pick out a book , " they pick our the " @entity120 " of bedtime stories			2
in this situation , there are a slew of kids books for the @entity19 that are animated , do voiceovers , etc. you can slap on the game , put it on mute and let bedtime stories get autopiloted			1
night - night , kiddos			2
the app that my kids seem to prefer is the " @entity136 " interactive book			1
with some voiceover and animation , it is an entertaining book for the kids and goes by pretty quickly so you can tuck the little rascals in and head back to the couch for the game			1
reason # 4 : @entity146 likes to ruin family plans we 've all been there			0
you and the family have outdoor plans for the weekend and mother nature decides to dump three inches of rain over your parade			0
you 're stuck in the house and for the first 24 hours , the kids are good to go			2
however , promises of rollercoaster rides , cotton candy and games has turned into a long couch jockey session that turns the kids into anxious , rambunctious and pesky kids			2
a weekend stuck in the house comes with a breaking point and it 's your job as a dad to know when that is			2
when you sense it coming , break out the @entity19 and fire up " @entity170 , " " @entity171 " or the arcade classic , " @entity173			1
" reason # 5 : ever try potty training a kid ? other than the no - sleep thing , potty training is the worst thing a parent goes through			2
it 's such a frustrating experience			2
you know how easy it is to hit the head			0
you do it a zillion times a day			0
so , why does n't your kid get it ? why does he insist on hiding behind the couch in the playroom and dropping something in his pants that should be quarantined by the @entity194 ? well , in comes the @entity19 to the rescue			1
trust me on this one			0
find yourself a slew of games that he likes , plop him down on the bowl and let ' er rip			0
it might take a few tries , but eventually , little @entity205 will be tugging at your leg pants and saying , " @entity207 , pops , i need to drop one			0
where 's your @entity19 ? i have to catch up on the scores from last night 's game			1
" in my case , my youngest would play " pac - man , " " @entity214 " and " @entity215			0
" not sure if i was prouder of her actually doing the deed or selecting to play " pac - man			0
" my inner geek dad rejoiced			0
so regardless of all the @entity220 speak that @entity221 fed the world when he launched the @entity19 and introduced the @entity19 2 , do n't let him fool you			1
the @entity19 is n't a revolutionary communications tool			1
it 's your parental ace in the hole			0
