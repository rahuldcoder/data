-- @entity1 knows you have been waiting			1
the star of the hit @entity5 series " scandal " is fully aware that there is a legion of " gladiators in suits " ( as fans call themselves ) eagerly awaiting the return of the series			2
she , too , is pretty excited to be back playing @entity16 insider and crisis management expert @entity15			1
@entity15 is a " fixer " who formerly worked for her lover , @entity21 president @entity20			2
when told that there are many women who try to emulate both @entity15 's sense of fashion and take - charge personality , @entity16 laughs			1
" i do , too , " she said			0
the series ended its first season with the revelation that the character @entity31 , an employee of @entity15 's ( and played by @entity32 ) , was not actually @entity31			2
@entity31 calls @entity15 after she is jailed for the murder of her boyfriend , a reporter who was digging into the secrets of president @entity20 's administration			0
did we mention that said president also happens to be in love with @entity15 ? season 2 answers the " who is @entity31 " question in the first episode , but @entity1 said there will be plenty of other surprises and mystery this season that even she is n't sure about			1
" every week is a surprise , " she said			0
" it 's kind of ridiculous because we do n't get an outline of the season , so the same way when [ fans ] watch it week to week and we live tweet with them and they are shocked , we feel that way when we read [ the scripts ] week to week			2
it 's shocker after shocker and it 's great			0
" while last season focused more on " realizing no one is who you think they are , " @entity1 said the new season will be more about " how those secrets complicate other people 's lives			1
" " it 's about how those secrets impact those around them , either because they know or they do n't know , " she said			0
" things get very complicated			0
" not that @entity16 can be called on to unravel too much before the show 's premiere thursday night			1
the actress said there is no way she is trying to run afoul of series creator @entity89 by revealing plot lines			0
@entity16 is more comfortable talking about the other star of " scandal , " @entity15 's stylish wardrobe			1
the actress said it 's exciting that fans have gotten so into @entity15 's pantsuits and handbags , because she and costume designer @entity99 have worked really diligently on @entity15 's look			0
" we 've always been on the same page in terms of her style , " @entity1 said			1
" a big part of that was this is a woman who used to work for the establishment , but now she works for herself			0
we wanted the clothes to be really elegant , smart and tailored in a @entity16 aesthetic , but we also wanted to be more fashion forward and use more @entity114 designers , because she does work for herself and she has global clientele			1
" @entity119 fashion : outfitting ' scandal ' @entity1 said @entity15 also does n't shy away from her femininity and certainly not her sexuality , which has resulted in some steamy scenes with president @entity20			1
the actress said she is loving the fact that not many eyebrows have been raised by the fact that a black female character on a television show is involved in a torrid romance with a white male character			0
" i think the big deal is that it 's not a big deal , and i think that 's cool , " @entity1 said			1
" what i love is that the conversation is not ' oh this is such a big deal , ' but ' oh how interesting that this is part of the full picture of who they are			0
' " the actress said that it 's fun for her to play " inside the @entity146 " in a series that is not at all like the current political landscape			0
@entity16 is herself very politically aware , and spoke at the recent @entity148			2
her interest in politics stems , she said , from her parents - especially her mother , a retired professor whose dinner parties exposed a young @entity16 to activism early on			1
" as a kid , there would be dinners where her colleagues would be talking about a woman 's right to choose , affirmative action and redistricting , " @entity1 recalled			2
" i grew up talking about these issues and knowing that politics were not separate from us as people			2
" @entity16 's next big project is the eagerly awaited @entity169 film " @entity170			1
" the movie is set before the @entity172 and @entity16 plays a slave whose husband ( played by @entity175 ) seeks to rescue her from a brutal master on a @entity178 plantation			2
the project not only reunited @entity16 and @entity175 , who appeared together in the @entity182 bio-pic " @entity182 , " but it also gave the actress an opportunity to delve into a role that she said was challenging artistically and emotionally taxing			1
it was a part @entity1 said she 's not sure she would have been able to portray were it not for having the balance of the @entity15 role on " scandal			1
" " there would be days that would be so hard for me that @entity175 would turn to me and say , ' how are you doing , @entity194 , " she said			0
" it was to remind me that [ the role as @entity196 the slave ] was not just it			0
i feel very blessed that at this point in my career i am able to play both of these women , because we have a full range of experience and identity and history			0
it 's exciting to not just be defined by one section as to who we are as women and people of color			0

" scandal " returns for season 2 on thursday
@entity1 @entity16 says there will be plenty of mystery and surprises
she says she grew up with an interest in politics
