-- which came first , the troubles or the fame ? after the suicide of a former contestant on @entity8 's " @entity7 , " the spotlight shined bright on the issues of reality tv stars			1
@entity12 restaurant owner @entity11 plunged into @entity14 's @entity13 in september 2010 , and the @entity14 medical examiner ruled the death a suicide			1
@entity11 had appeared on the first season of the @entity20 reality show hosted by famed chef @entity8			1
at the time the episode was taped in 2007 , @entity11 was facing financial issues stemming from his then - struggling restaurant			2
@entity8 offered advice on how to turn his business around , telling the chef , " your business is about to f * * king swim down the @entity13			0
" @entity8 released a statement following @entity11 's death			0
" i was fortunate to spend time with @entity33 during the first season of ' @entity7 , ' " @entity8 said			1
" @entity33 was a brilliant chef , and our thoughts go out to his family , friends and staff			0
" @entity11 's death once again raised the specter of suicide in connection with reality television			1
" i absolutely do n't feel that everyone who appears on a reality show is a damaged person , " said @entity44 , founder of entertainment site @entity45 , which in 2009 examined the suicides of 11 people connected to reality shows			1
" i 'm just saying that there 's probably a higher percentage than in the normal population who are attracted to that and who might have some vulnerabilities that will be exploited by being on television			0
" there have been several cases , including @entity60 , a boxer who killed himself in 2005 after participating in the reality show " @entity62 , " hosted by @entity63 and @entity64			1
in 2008 , a one - time " @entity67 " auditioner , @entity66 , was found dead of an overdose near the home of one of the show 's judges , @entity70			1
@entity73 later said that @entity66 had been obsessed with her for several years and that she had begged producers not to allow @entity66 to audition			0
the @entity20 declined to comment on @entity66 's death , but former " idol " producer @entity77 told @entity78 he had no recollection of @entity73 requesting that @entity66 not be allowed on the show			2
@entity81 , a 2006 contestant on " @entity82 , " which is also hosted by @entity8 , was found dead of a gunshot wound in her @entity85 home in 2007			2
a representative of the @entity89 medical examiner 's office confirmed to @entity0 that @entity81 's death was ruled a suicide			2
princess @entity93 - @entity92 is a development producer who has worked on casting several reality shows , including " @entity95 of @entity96			1
" she said she has seen the process morph over the years			0
" i know that when i am casting , i am looking for that person who is going to shine , " @entity93 - @entity92 said			2
" that could be shining in personality , shining in lifestyle or shining in just their story			0
but i think it 's definitely changed in that ( casting professionals ) are probably now looking for a little bit more of the crazy			0
" but with so many people these days pursing the limelight via reality shows , is the number of troubled contestants just an expected statistic ? celebrity and fame expert @entity113 said that may be , though she pointed to a 2006 study authored by dr. @entity118 ( host of @entity121 's dr. @entity119 " and former @entity123 reality shows " celebrity rehab " and " @entity124 " ) and @entity126 as evidence that reality television attracts a specific type of personality			1
in the study , published in the @entity137 , celebrities including television stars , comedians , musicians and reality stars were given the @entity138			2
" the numbers for the reality stars were off the charts , " @entity113 said			2
" it makes sense , because you are not an actor playing a role , you 're not a musician hiding behind a guitar , you 're you			0
the level of narcissism for reality stars is documented and goes well beyond the normal population			2
" and while narcissism is n't an indicator for suicide , @entity113 said it can be an indicator of a troubled person who lacks the stability to deal with the dark side of notoriety			1
" reality television has provided an outlet for narcissistic individuals , many with limited abilities , to believe that they can succeed in the entertainment industry , " the study said			0
" this desire to enter the industry may be fueled by the types of fantasy feelings of success , power and glory that narcissists seem to exhibit			0
" dr. @entity173 , who in 2010 was medical director for the @entity174 , said that there is no data that definitively link reality television with an increased probability of suicide but that a mental disorder like narcissism could make a person more prone to taking his own life			1
" ninety percent of people who kill themselves have a mental disorder when they kill themselves , the most common one being depression , " she said			0
" there are all of these background factors that are the most important , and these reality shows and whatever happens might be the final straw			1
" the wrap 's @entity44 said their series on reality show suicides sought to examine whether the sometimes brutal nature of appearing on reality shows with all that entails , including public scrutiny , was a cause or whether such shows simply attract troubled individuals			1
@entity44 said the debate rages on			0
" i think the experts will tell you that both are factors , " she said			0
" to some degree , there are people who are needy in some way who are looking for fame for some particular reason to fill some need that they have which makes them particularly vulnerable			0
" " but also the experience of being on television exposed in that way and often seeing themselves on television being ' @entity221 - edited ' or what they call ' franken - bytes , ' where they edit a sequence together just to heighten the drama of every scene , is sometimes really mortifying for people , and they 're really not prepared for that			2
" @entity231 , who runs @entity232 , said she worries that those who are focused on the fame that reality tv brings may not be mentally or emotionally prepared for the downside			1
" if you fail on reality tv , you 're failing in a very big way , " she said			1
" in a way that is seen by millions and millions of people , and to have that level of vulnerability exposed can raise the dramatic stakes of your situation			0
" for help please contact the @entity245 or call 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255 and they will put you in touch with someone in your area .			0
