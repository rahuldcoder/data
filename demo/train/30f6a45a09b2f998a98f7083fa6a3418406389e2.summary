-- have you been wondering why @entity2 , @entity3 , is the first stop for president @entity5 after his @entity6 address ? could be that he wants to continue his conversation with @entity10 families about rebuilding the nation 's economy			1
or that he wants to lift @entity14 blues that @entity3 will turn red in the next election			2
any true space cadet will tell you that @entity2 was chosen for its " @entity20 moment			1
" in his speech tuesday night , @entity5 spoke of this generation 's @entity20 moment , challenging @entity10 to take the next innovative leap forward			1
where else to launch that new course of direction but in the tiny @entity29 town that 's best known for its own @entity20 moment			1
and it was a whopper			0
on september 6 , 1962 -- when @entity5 was but a mere lad , @entity32 occupied the @entity34 and the @entity35 was raging -- a 20 - pound hunk of smoldering metal fell from the sky and crashed in the middle of @entity2 's @entity40			1
turns out it was a piece of the @entity43 satellite @entity44 the @entity20 moment that @entity5 referenced happened when the @entity43 launched the first - man made object into space -- @entity48 in 1957 -- shocking the @entity10 into a technological boom			2
@entity20 came five years later			2
it burned up in the atmosphere and ended up linking @entity2 to @entity20 in a way no other @entity10 town is			1
two @entity2 police officers noticed what looked like a piece of cardboard lying in the street , according to the @entity59 , which sponsors a @entity20 festival in @entity2 every year			1
they approached the glowing object and kicked it to the curb , thinking it was a piece of slag from a local foundry			0
wrong ! after they heard about @entity20 breaking up in space , they realized what they had stumbled upon and rushed back to retrieve it from the gutter			0
it was sent to the @entity74 for analysis and was confirmed as a piece of the @entity43 satellite			0
the @entity43 eventually reclaimed their precious chunk			0
but @entity2 was forever etched into the history of space exploration , a fact that is now celebrated each year with @entity82			0
... it 's wacky ! it 's tacky ! it 's time to celebrate with @entity82 ! " says the festival 's website			0
" be hokey , fun , and ridiculous ! " @entity88 , a @entity59 staffer , said she watched @entity5 's speech tuesday night and after he spoke of the @entity20 moment , she wondered : is this why he 's coming to my town ? " oh my gosh , " she said to herself			1
" i wonder if he knows we have a ( @entity20 ) replica here			0
" no matter , @entity88 said , @entity5 's visit to @entity2 is sure to be cosmic .			2
