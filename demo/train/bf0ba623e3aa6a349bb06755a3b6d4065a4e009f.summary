the @entity153 determined that a fingerprint lifted from the @entity136 ransom note matched @entity3			1
that gave the state 's attorney two powerful pieces of evidence against @entity3			1
but a confession would seal his fate			2

" @entity182 " was how @entity31 described it			0
@entity9 , who wrote a book that attempts to prove @entity3 is innocent , said a political component is keeping him in prison			1

" this is not a largely understood case , " @entity194 said			0
" people know the term @entity3 , and that there was a sensational crime , but i do n't think it 's talked about in detail			1
" he added , " i feel like it defies logic , and that 's what 's troubling about it			0
when you look closely at the nature of these kinds [ of confessions ] and when you know how these confessions were acquired , there 's enough there to -- at the very least -- to make you feel very unsure			0

" he still wants to be out			0
" @entity31 said that time has come			0
" this is a case where i have serious doubts about his guilt , " he said			0
" but it 's a case where there is no question in my mind that the circus - like atmosphere that pervaded his arrest and his prosecution resulted in a trial proceeding for @entity11 and a guilty plea that was fundamentally unfair			2
" " they probably have good hearts and are dedicated , " @entity107 said of @entity3 ' believers			1
