@entity0 -- when a two - member panel holds a @entity6 parole hearing for notorious murderer @entity7 on wednesday , he will be represented by state - appointed attorney @entity8 , who will urge the state to put @entity7 in a mental hospital , @entity2 told @entity1			1
@entity7 , 77 , and @entity2 , 45 , who was a small boy at the time of the " @entity7 " killings in 1969 , have n't yet met			1
in fact , it is unclear whether @entity7 will attend the parole hearing , his attorney said			1
" he did n't come to my interview either , so i have never met him , " @entity2 said in an exclusive interview with @entity1			0
" i went to go interview him last month			0
i asked the correction officers was he coming out of his cell , and they said nope			0
and i said ok , who 's the next inmate ? " @entity2 is a @entity24 , @entity6 , general practitioner lawyer who also works as a state - appointed attorney for inmates at about nine parole hearings every two months , he said			1
" i always knew in the back of my mind that there was an opportunity to do this for someone of this notoriety , " @entity2 said about being assigned to represent @entity7 at the hearing			1
" i 've worked in many prisons			0
i 'm not this crusader to go in and get people accused of murder off			0
but if they have earned a second chance and done the proper courses and gone to @entity43 and anger management and shown remorse and have a job waiting for them and a residence , i 'm all for parole , " he said			2
@entity2 will tell the parole board that @entity7 is in need of psychiatric care at @entity53 , about 95 miles southwest of the state prison in @entity55 , @entity6 , where he is serving a life sentence and where the parole hearing will also take place			1
@entity55 is about 170 miles northwest of downtown @entity0			1
a recent prison photo released to @entity1 shows @entity7 yielding to old age -- with unruly long gray hair and a full beard , but with subdued eyes that no longer flash a signature helter - @entity66 menace			1
@entity7 still bears a swastika tattooed on his forehead above , and between , his eyes			1
" @entity7 does not need incarceration at this point in his life , " @entity2 said			1
" i mean the issues in regard to his psychiatric makeup and the health concerns that a 76 - or 77 - year - old man would need , " he explained			2
" what he did was heinous from what he said			0
how many years has he been in prison ? i was just a little boy , but after all these years , has there been any rehabilitation ? i do n't know			1
he probably needs more hospitalization than incarceration			0
" @entity7 was initially sentenced to death for the 1969 slayings of actress @entity92 and six others by a group of his followers as part of what prosecutors said was an attempt to incite a race war			1
the enduring fascination of the @entity92 murder his death sentence was changed to life in prison after @entity6 's death penalty was overturned for a period during the 1970s			1
@entity7 has been denied parole 11 times			1
the last time he appeared at his parole hearing was 15 years ago			1
in an interview tuesday with @entity1 , @entity111 , the sister of @entity92 , said she has been attending @entity7 's parole hearings for the past 15 years -- and @entity7 has not shown up			1
@entity114 agreed with some legal experts ' observations that wednesday 's parole hearing could be the last one for the aging @entity7 , who , if he 's denied parole this week , may not be eligible again until as late as 2027			1
if it denies parole for @entity7 , the two - member panel of the @entity123 can schedule his next hearing three , five , seven , 10 or 15 years from now , said spokeswoman @entity125 of the @entity127			1
said @entity114 : " i 'm hoping he 'll show up this time , and then i will have a lot more to say			2
" he needs to look into our eyes , victims ' eyes , and see the pain that he has caused , " @entity114 added			0
" i think that that is something that is essential to his coming to peace , perhaps before he passes			0
" as you said , this is probably going to be his last parole hearing , " she told @entity1			1
@entity114 acknowledged that @entity7 holds a prominent -- and grisly -- place among mass murderers			1
" there is a unique social icon kind of a thing that goes along with the @entity7 , " @entity114 said			1
" they have made murder popular			0
they have more followers than they have ever had			0
there have been murders done in their name			0
quite frankly , i do not understand it			0
i understand there are a lot of young people that are looking for something to believe in , but i do n't see how you could possibly think this man is leadership material			0
i do n't get it			0
" @entity2 , @entity7 's state - appointed attorney , said he would be surprised if @entity7 shows up to the parole hearing , but he 's still hoping it happens			1
" that will shock me too , but i 'm going to do what i have to do			0
i 'm anticipating him doing that , changing his mind and coming out , " @entity2 said			0
" i would hope he would			0
then my argument would basically be established , that he needs hospitalization and not incarceration at this point			0
" as a boy , @entity2 said he remembered reading " @entity66 , " the best - selling book about the @entity7 rampage			1
" even now all these years later , it 's the kind of thing that goes boo in the night , " @entity2 said of the killings			2
i read a copy of ' @entity66 , ' a copy in my grandmother 's house			2
i think i was on punishment			0
i could n't put it down			2
i did n't read the whole thing , but i read enough to know it was a horrible , horrible time			2
" former prosecutor @entity190 , who co-authored " @entity66 " and prosecuted @entity7 and members of his " family , " said he believed @entity7 wo n't be paroled			2
" look at his two co-defendants right now who are still alive , " he said of @entity193 and @entity194 , who are still imprisoned on life sentences			2
" he orchestrated and was behind all the murders			0
" it 's preposterous on its face			2
basically , it 's a nonissue and not going to happen , " @entity190 said of the possibility of parole			2
he frequently has n't showed up at parole hearings			2
" in attempting to ignite an apocalyptic race war that @entity7 called " @entity66 " after a @entity208 song , @entity7 's " family " took the lives of seven people over two nights in august 1969 in @entity0 : they inflicted 169 stab wounds and seven .22 - caliber gunshot wounds			1
they used the blood of their victims to scrawl anti-establishment messages on the walls : " pig , " " @entity223 , " " rise " and a misspelled " @entity224			0
" actress @entity92 , 26 , famed hairstylist @entity226 , 35 , coffee fortune heiress @entity227 , 25 , and two others died shortly after midnight on august 9 , 1969 , at a rambling house overlooking @entity231			0

a fork jutted from @entity236 's abdomen , where one of his killers had carved the word " war			0
