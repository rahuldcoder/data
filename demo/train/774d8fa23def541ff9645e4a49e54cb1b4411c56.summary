-- it was an exciting day for @entity2 and her 11 - year - old daughter @entity3			1
they were summoned to their parish , the @entity7 and @entity8 in @entity9 to pick up the equivalent of a jackpot for @entity13 @entity12 : tickets to attend a mass presided by the pope in @entity17 , about four hours from @entity9			1

he also visited the @entity36 in 2008			0
but @entity23 's trip will likely be overshadowed by his deceased predecessor , pope @entity38 a week before @entity23 's arrival , an exhibit to honor @entity38 opened in @entity9			1
the exhibit , entitled " @entity42 in @entity43 , " is at @entity9 's @entity44 ( @entity45 )			1
it includes 200 personal items used by @entity38 throughout his life and papacy			0
exhibit organizer @entity50 says they 're expecting as many as 300,000 visitors in the three months the exhibit will last			0
@entity55 is also an admirer of the late pontiff , who first visited @entity9 in 1979			2
" it was such a magnetic energy that you could feel whenever he was around really			0
it would just transform the people when he visited , " @entity55 said			0
@entity38 's shoes , which are also part of the exhibit , are indeed big shoes to fill			0
@entity9 was the first country he visited in 1979 , shortly after becoming pope			2
he would visit four more times in 1990 , 1993 , 1999 and 2002 , traveling to 12 of @entity9 's 31 states			2

" @entity38 was an energetic 58 - year - old when he first arrived in @entity9 in 1979			1
the rev. @entity72 , spokesman with the @entity73 , says it 's just a matter of time before @entity13 @entity12 learn to love @entity23			1
" when @entity38 came to @entity9 for the first time nobody knew him			2
it was only after getting to know him that people started loving him			0
therefore , we should n't jump to conclusions			0
let us welcome @entity23 to this land and show him that @entity13 are good hosts , " @entity72 says			1
a survey conducted by @entity83 , a national polling firm , found that more than three - quarters of @entity13 @entity12 are not excited by the visit or less excited than they were when the previous pope visited			1
one place the pope will not visit is @entity9			1
@entity23 is 85 and the city 's high altitude poses a risk to the pope 's health , say @entity95 officials			2
@entity2 still treasures the previous pope 's visits , including to her native @entity9 , but adds , " there 's no comparison between them ; they 're very different			2
" " pope @entity38 loved being close to the people			0
" of his decision not to visit @entity9 , @entity2 says , " i know there 's a lot of conflict right now , but we do n't like the fact that he 's not coming to @entity9			2
