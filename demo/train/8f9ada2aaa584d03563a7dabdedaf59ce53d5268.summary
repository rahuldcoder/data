eleven days later , searchers are still looking for passengers and crew aboard the @entity39 ferry			1
they have retrieved 187 bodies so far , with another 115 still missing			1
the search saturday was suspended due to bad weather that made diving through the murky waters especially dangerous			2
a day earlier , divers found the bodies of 48 girls -- wearing their life jackets -- pressed into a room too small for so many people			1
divers believe that they will face the same scene again			2
there may be a second , similar room , where 50 more girls are believed to have been trapped when the ferry rolled over			1
@entity1 coast guard diver @entity57 said he had tears in his eyes when he heard about the accident			2
" even now , i 'm searching as if i 'm looking for my own children -- and other coast guards feel the same way , " he told @entity2			2
" i have two medical patches on me , have difficulty breathing and my head hurts			2
but it hurts the most in my heart , knowing those children are still in the cold water			2
" those still diving face a search that is getting harder and slower			2
now they will head down deep for cabins near the seabed			2
in the cramped spaces , divers have been battling a forest of floating objects and doors forced shut by tremendous water pressure			2
currents tug at the breathing tubes that keep them alive as they look for the dead			0
there may be fewer bodies to retrieve , but divers have already searched the easily accessible places , said @entity89 capt. @entity88 , commander of the rescue operation			1
" but the navy will not stop until the last body is found , " he said			1

@entity57 thinks he may have pulled 25 people from the frigid waters of the @entity110 , he said saturday			0

there were a lot of people and not enough boats , people in the water yelling for help			0
the ferry was sinking fast , " he said			1

investigators also searched the company that owned the ferry and the home of the man whose family controls it , and conducted a wide - ranging probe into the country 's marine industry			1
prosecutors have said that authorities have yet to determine what caused the sinking			0
leading theories include changes made to increase the ferry 's passenger capacity , and shifting cargo			1
on friday , investigators checked out the @entity39 's sister ship , the @entity183 , and said they found 40 of its life rafts were n't working , emergency slides to help evacuate passengers were inoperable , and equipment to tie down cars and cargo either was nonexistent or did n't work very well			1
like the @entity39 , the @entity192 had been modified to add more passengers , the prosecutor 's office said			0
investigators are looking into whether those modifications could have contributed to the @entity39 's fate			0
@entity197 , an opposition lawmaker who represents @entity0 , an island near where the ship sank , told @entity2 that modifications to add 117 more passenger cabins to the ship raised the ferry 's center of gravity			2
on friday , the @entity206 announced it would ask lawmakers to consider legislation prohibiting modifications to ships to increase passenger capacity			0
