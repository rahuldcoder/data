-- the morning after teams of gunmen carried out a brazen series of attacks across southern @entity6 , killing scores of people and taking hostages in three locations , the situation showed little signs of a quick resolution			1
a series of gunshots rang through the air at the @entity16 thursday morning , where about 100 members of a specialized unit of the @entity20 police undertook an operation to rescue four to five foreigners hostages on the 19th floor			1
a few blocks away , a series of gunfire sent curious onlookers scurrying for cover at the @entity30			2
shortly afterward , police escorted dozens of people -- who appeared to be mostly westerners -- out of the hotel			1
@entity36 , the police chief of @entity38 state , where @entity6 is located , said all hostages there had been freed			1

it was not immediately known whether gunmen at the hospital fled or were killed			2
@entity52 @entity51 was attempting to locate about 20 @entity52 nationals missing in the city as police said four suspected gunmen took cover in a building called @entity59 , where several @entity61 families live			1
police said gunmen fired indiscriminately from the building throughout the night			1
stray bullets killed a couple in their home and a 16 - year - old boy who stepped outside , police said			2
authorities asked residents in @entity6 to stay inside , uncertain whether other attacks were planned in the city			1

@entity6 remained locked down with police checking cars randomly			1
the stock market in the city -- the financial capital of @entity20 -- was closed , as were schools and colleges			0
government officials said the attacks caught them completely unawares , with no intelligence chatter indicating that such a coordinated assault was in the works			2
instead , authorities had focused their attention on securing movie theaters and malls after receiving indications that terrorists were intending to attack those locations , @entity41 reported			0

at the five - star @entity30 , a fire continued to burn hours after it began on the top floor of the majestic , century - old @entity115 building popular among @entity117 tourists and diplomats			1
@entity0 employee @entity119 was among the guests at the @entity30 who holed up in her fourth - floor room for several hours , then ran out her door , down the stairs , into the lobby and past the pool in the rear of the hotel to safety			0
" i saw a few casualties on the way down , " she told @entity0			0
she said she also saw the guest in a room above hers			0
he had smashed out his fifth - floor window to escape the fire and was hanging out his window , but no one was there to help			0
" he was just screaming and yelling for help , " she said , adding that she did not know what became of the man			0
" i 'd been instructed just to get out of my room , " she said			0
@entity144 , a spokesman for @entity38 , said no one had claimed responsibility for the attacks			1
but several @entity20 news outlets reported receiving e-mails from a group calling itself the @entity151 that claimed responsibility for the attacks			2
@entity0 was not able to verify the reports			0
@entity144 said nine suspects were arrested overnight and three other people were detained for questioning			2
@entity41 reported that seven of the nine arrested are fishermen			0
the network said that police found a boat loaded with explosives near the @entity30			2
@entity163 , chief of @entity6 police 's anti-terrorism squad , was among the fatalities at the @entity167 , officials said			1
in addition , 11 other police were killed , @entity168 said			2
he said officials did not know how many attackers were involved			0
a man told local television that he was in the @entity167 around 10 p.m. when gunmen entered the lobby and began rounding up guests , asking for anyone with a @entity180 or @entity181 passport and taking hostage about 15 of them			0
the @entity184 , another popular hangout for @entity117 tourists , was also targeted , and one police official said an attack occurred at the @entity190 railway station , a @entity115 building			1

@entity36 , the police chief of @entity38 , said the gunmen used grenades and automatic weapons			1
@entity20 has suffered a number of attacks in recent years , including a string of bombs that ripped through packed @entity6 commuter trains and platforms during rush hour in july 2006			1
about 209 people were killed in that attack			0
last july , a series of synchronized bomb blasts in the western @entity20 city of @entity213 left 49 dead and more than 100 wounded , police said			1
but @entity214 , a businessman in @entity6 , described wednesday 's attacks as unlike any previous ones			1
" they really do n't fear for their lives or any other activity that could put them in danger , " he told @entity0			0
