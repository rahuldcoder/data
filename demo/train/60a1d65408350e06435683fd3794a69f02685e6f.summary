-- two 's company , three 's chaos in " @entity3 , " a high - tech , high - octane gloss on the type of story we 've seen a million times in sitcoms and screwball comedies			1
taking his cue from @entity15 's " @entity14 , " director @entity16 aims for a kind of macho rom - com , a date movie that appeals to both men and women			1
the end product is slick , flashy and obnoxious			2
@entity23 has top billing , but rising stars @entity25 and @entity27 call the shots as charmingly irresponsible @entity31 operatives @entity29 and @entity32			1
after an embarrassing fracas overseas , these best buds are assigned to office duty			2
and with homeland security very much on the back burner , it 's not long before their thoughts turn to women ... or , as fate would have it , the same woman			1
divorced dad @entity32 meets @entity45 through a dating agency			2
but within minutes of their first date , she bumps into @entity29 , a confirmed bachelor and ladies man			0
she calls him on his transparent lines , but he 's persistent , and circumstances throw them back together even as she fixes up a second date with @entity32			0
( @entity45 's a consumer products tester by trade , not someone who 'd buy a car without taking it for a spin			0
) when they realize they 're both chasing the same girl , the guys decide to let the lady make her choice -- without coming clean			0

in the movie 's breeziest patches , the two hunks eavesdrop on @entity45 as she compares their shortcomings with @entity77 ( an authentically abrasive @entity78 )			0
it might help if both men did n't come off so self - involved			2
we 're meant to understand they love each other , as much as -- and probably more than -- @entity45 , but that does n't make their romantic trickery any easier to stomach			0
@entity27 is a terrifically intense actor , who made a strong impression in " @entity89 " and " warrior , " and will soon be appearing as @entity91 in " @entity92			1
" but he does n't make as much sense as a sensitive and domesticated superagent			1
@entity25 , on the other hand , is all too convincing as a smug and superficial womanizer			1
@entity23 has the trickiest job of all , trying to retain our sympathies as she falls for both men			0
she might have pulled it off , except , it seems , " @entity103 " director @entity16 is n't interested in the emotional integrity of the character			1
he appeared far more invested in showing off the latest spyware gizmos and gadgets			0
in almost every respect , " @entity3 " can be seen as the polar opposite of @entity23 's last rom - com , " @entity112			1
" most critics were n't kind to that picture ( and it bombed in theaters ) , but , at the very least , it was an attempt to make sense of sex and romance in a real way			2
this crass and miscalculated movie might have been engineered by machines .			0
