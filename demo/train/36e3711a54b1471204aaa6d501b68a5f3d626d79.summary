@entity0 , @entity1 -- no group has stepped forward so far to claim responsibility for a massive car bombing in the southern @entity1 city of @entity7 that killed at least 45 people over the weekend in what appeared to be the latest attack on the @entity12 minority in the country			1
the blast sunday tore into nearby buildings , wounding about 150 people , and authorities warned that the death toll could rise as rescue workers continued to search for bodies amid the rubble			1
caused by a vehicle loaded with about 150 kilograms ( 330 lbs ) of explosives set to a timer , the explosion took place in @entity28 , an area of @entity7 where many @entity12 live , police said			1
in recent months , a number of large - scale bomb attacks have targeted @entity12 , who are overwhelmingly outnumbered by @entity31 in @entity1			1
a huge bombing last month in a @entity12 neighborhood in the city of @entity35 killed about 90 people and fueled outrage about authorities ' failure to stem the attacks , many of which were claimed by the @entity31 militant group @entity43			2
@entity1 security forces responded by carrying out raids in the area in which four militants were killed and others arrested			0
but sunday 's attack in @entity7 suggested they had n't done enough to dissuade further attacks			2
@entity52 says it has documented 92 separate attacks on @entity12 across @entity1 since january 2012 that have resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people			0
it has criticized what it says is the lack of prosecutions of those responsible for the violence			0
@entity1 's prime minister @entity63 and president @entity64 both condemned the bombing sunday			0
although many of the recent attacks against @entity12 in @entity1 have focused on the @entity69 in @entity35 , sectarian violence has struck @entity7 previously			1
in february 2010 , for instance , at least 18 people died in blasts that took place near a bus full of @entity12 religious observers and in front of a hospital in the city			0
and in late 2009 , a suicide bomb attack on a @entity12 procession moving through @entity7 killed at least 40 people			2
@entity2 's @entity82 reported from @entity0 and @entity83 wrote from @entity84			0

the blast apparently targeted @entity12 in @entity7 , police say
authorities say the toll could rise as rescue workers search the rubble
@entity12 have been the *victims* of dozens of sectarian attacks in the past year
