but every day he dreams of going back to the ocean			1
for decades , he made an impressive career out of freediving with great white sharks			1
the @entity6 daredevil survived numerous encounters with these ocean predators			1
and when he needed to get closer to the animals , taking the cage out of cage diving was a risk the pioneering diver was willing to take			1
but a debilitating stroke three years ago tragically left the ex-fisherman unable to get close to the sharks he came to love			1
today , the closest he can get is through the tours of a local shark diving firm , @entity20 , where he provides his expert knowledge for eager tourists			1
" it 's been 11 years since i last swam with a shark , and i 've love to get back into it again at a later stage , " @entity24 says			1
" i 'm not ready yet -- but i 'm sure once i can swim properly , i 'll be there again			1
" this passionate pioneer of the oceans has spent years studying what many believe is one of the most dangerous predators in the world			1
" i 'm just mesmerized by how they move and what they do , and that fascinates me			2
they 're like an aeroplane -- they fly in the water			2
those wings flex with the weight of the body			2
" born in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity24 has been a bit of thrillseeker ever since he was a child			2
by his teens , he could often be found with his friends trying to catch snakes with their bare hands			2
following graduation , the young risk - taker drifted from various jobs			2
finally after serving his mandatory national service in the army , @entity24 found spearfishing			2
an accidental encounter the ancient and rather arduous tradition of spearfishing has been used for millennia across the globe			2
it has also become a competitive sport and @entity24 soon became one of the country 's top spearfishers			2
then one day in 1977 during a seemingly normal practice dive , @entity24 would have a close encounter that would change his life forever			2
he 'd been diving for a few hours and was reeling in his line when a sharp movement flicked past him			2
thinking it was a shoal of fish , he tried to move around it and was confronted with a big , black eye			0
" it was a white shark , my first white shark and i thought ' wow , wait until i tell my friends , ' " he recalls			1
" first white shark and it 's huge			1
( it ) looks like a house next to me			0
" once the initial shock and awe of the situation wore off , @entity24 started to tussle with the large predator , pushing back as the shark came in a little too close for comfort			1
" when he bit down on the ( spear ) gun , i was paralyzed from shock			0
i did n't expect it			0
and then it reopened its mouth and i saw my hands go in			0
i thought ' uh oh ' and i jumped back to life and jerked it out of his mouth			0
" i put my fist on his eye meaning to gorge his eye out and he just spat the gun out and dived down and swam away			0
" after this dramatic confrontation , @entity24 laid still for five minutes , recalling how he swore he would never dive again			0
but the decision did n't last too long			0
he adds : " the next morning a buddy calls ' hey are we going to dive some cray fishes this afternoon ? ' i said , ' yeah , that 's a good idea			0
' " ' i became the guy ' in the late 80s , @entity24 began to see business opportunities from the big , blue sea			0
shark tourism was booming and cage diving was quickly becoming a popular way of getting up close with the great whites off the coast			1
by 1997 , the savvy entrepreneur had started his own company taking eager adventurers to sea and lowering them gently beneath the waves to meet the sharks at close range			1
within months , the business began to take off and filmmakers came knocking at his door			0
the budding entrepreneur had found his niche			0
" i became the guy -- if you want to film sharks , go to @entity0			1
within two years they needed shots they could n't get so i said jump in the water and we 'll get it			0
because when you 're in the cage with a camera it shakes so i started taking people out of the cage			0
" over the years , @entity24 's reputation as one of @entity6 's leading shark experts has brought big opportunities and even the chance to join a film shoot in @entity163			1
but then things took a turn for the worst			0
" when i came back , i actually had a stroke on my right hand side which paralyzed me completely			1
" refusing to let his stroke become a setback , he began to fight back recovering quickly			1
but then three years ago , @entity24 suffered another stroke , this time it was too much and left him unable to swim with the sea creatures he loves			1
" at the moment i 'm just really starting to walk			0
but i still fall down every now and then			0
but i mean that happens , " he says			0
" i 've just got to get stronger ... i 'm walking short steps and it 's going slowly			0
" i mean the way i 've lived my life , if i have to do it again , i 'll do it exactly the same			0
" watch the full show to find out more about @entity24 's exciting experiences of freediving with great white sharks .			1
