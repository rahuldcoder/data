-- @entity1 is known for indy 500 car racing and its playoff - worthy @entity4 basketball team			0
but this week , astronomers like me have taken over the town for the 222nd meeting of the @entity9			0
you may have seen coverage of new discoveries about exoplanets , star formation , dwarf galaxies , cosmology and more			1
a public star party on monday evening gave the public a chance to see @entity20 and other sights , followed by the @entity22 whizzing overhead			0
tuesday evening , @entity24 founder @entity23 gave a public lecture , " discovering planets from your sofa : adventures in @entity29 , " about how hundreds of thousands of interested citizens are making original scientific discoveries , including finding new exoplanets			2
@entity9 meetings are terrific for learning about the latest research , networking with colleagues , recruiting graduate students or forming new research collaborations			1
but something is very different about this particular conference			2
that 's because many colleagues who work for federal agencies like the @entity43 and @entity44 have been told to stay home			1
deep cuts in already paltry federal travel budgets mean federal scientists are not presenting their research findings			1
there is less communication between program officers and the scientists who carry out the @entity43 and @entity44 missions			2
important work funded by taxpayer dollars is not being disseminated , reducing return on investment			0
there are fewer conversations in which @entity43 and @entity44 officials learn about astronomers ' latest results and talk about agency plans			1
hundreds of thousands of scientists work in the federal government			1
to take just one example , @entity44 scientists were instrumental in deducing the initial fluctuations in matter density in the newborn universe , 13.7 billion years ago , which led to the formation of galaxies like the one we live in today			2
this work garnered the @entity76 for physics			0
the nation benefits when top scientists like these contribute their efforts to the federal agencies			1
but civil service scientists are at a significant competitive disadvantage , thanks to new travel restrictions			1
at first glance , it might sound like a good idea to keep government employees and contractors from traveling to distant cities to meet with colleagues			2
after all , budgets are tight and travel costs money			1
stories about excessive spending at government conferences involving the @entity99 and @entity100 have rightly angered taxpayers who have had to tighten their own belts			2
but the @entity9 conference is strictly business and the downside of missing it is considerable : the government loses touch , government scientists fall behind and we all lose an opportunity to forge ahead			1
for @entity44 , which funds about 300,000 jobs at more than a dozen @entity44 centers and facilities , its cap of 50 civil service scientists and contractors ( or even100 , possible only with a waiver ) at an @entity9 meeting is very low			2
ceo @entity120 pulled her @entity122 employees back into the office , away from telecommuting , because personal interactions are vital to innovation			0
we do use e-mail , @entity130 , video conferences and every other modern technique to save money and time			0
but every so often , you have to have a real conversation			0
government scientists are evaluated regularly , like most of us , and their scientific stature is measured in part by invitations to give talks at international meetings or to help lead those meetings			1
yet federal scientists and contractors are prevented from attending any international meetings			1
let 's be clear : not only ca n't government employees travel to meetings on the government 's dime , they ca n't present the results of their scientific research at all , even if they take vacation days and pay for the travel			1
travel policies that diminish the effectiveness of government scientists are counterproductive			1
not only does the work have less impact , some of our nation 's very best scientific talent will choose to leave government service			2
this is good news for universities and companies who offer these outstanding scientists a better research environment			1
but the government ends up losing top talent			2
science careers are attractive in many ways , but across the country , sequestration is devastating budgets for research			1
in many disciplines , 10 proposals for new research projects are rejected for every one that is funded			0
this turns serious scientific progress into a scattershot lottery and discourages students from pursuing the kind of research careers that fuel our economy in the long term			0
young people are attracted to science through astronomy			0
students come to our talks , star parties and classes			0
fascination about black holes and dark energy motivates them to study critical subjects like physics , mathematics and computing			0
astronomy research experiences for undergraduates -- funded by the @entity43 , among others -- are an effective way to retain students in @entity213 , or @entity214 , majors			0
@entity214 disciplines are critical for the future of our nation			0
the skills for astronomy are used in many other fields of science , not to mention areas like data mining and computing that are at the heart of modern businesses			0
my own research students study supermassive black holes billions of light years from @entity233 -- not exactly an issue in daily life , it 's true , but while some of those students have pursued careers as astronomers , many have gone into other areas , including theoretical physics , high school science teaching , oceanography , energy , veterinary school , the financial industry and computing , contributing in important ways to the @entity214 enterprise			0
a recent article in the prestigious journal nature shows that the best science comes from international collaborations			0
so our short - sighted policies are preventing government scientists from conducting the best possible research , not to mention losing @entity261 leadership in important international efforts			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity265 .			1

@entity265 : @entity268 conference *highlights* new discoveries
at meetings , she says , scientists learn latest research , network , recruit researchers
@entity265 : cuts in travel budgets mean many federal scientists told to stay home
@entity265 : government will fall behind , lose its scientists if it does n't invest more
