-- here are 15 things everyone should know about @entity3 : every one of mr. @entity6 's cardigan sweaters was hand - knitted by @entity3 ' mother			1
most people have heard of @entity8 , the @entity12 - educated gorilla who could speak about 1000 words in @entity15 , and understand about 2000 in @entity16			2
what most people do n't know , however , is that @entity8 was an avid @entity19 fan			2
as @entity20 reported , when @entity3 took a trip out to meet @entity8 for his show , not only did she immediately wrap her arms around him and embrace him , she did what she 'd always seen him do onscreen : she proceeded to take his shoes off ! 2			1
he made thieves think twice			0
according to a tv guide piece on him , @entity3 drove a plain old impala for years			1
one day , however , the car was stolen from the street near the tv station			1
when @entity3 filed a police report , the story was picked up by every newspaper , radio and media outlet around town			1
amazingly , within 48 hours the car was left in the exact spot where it was taken from , with an apology on the dashboard			1
it read , " if we 'd known it was yours , we never would have taken it			0
" @entity0 : memorable commencement speakers 3			0
he watched his figure to the pound			0
in covering @entity3 ' daily routine ( waking up at 5 a.m. ; praying for a few hours for all of his friends and family ; studying ; writing , making calls and reaching out to every fan who took the time to write him ; going for a morning swim ; getting on a scale ; then really starting his day ) , writer @entity54 explained that mr. @entity3 weighed in at exactly 143 pounds every day for the last 30 years of his life			1
he did n't smoke , did n't drink , did n't eat the flesh of any animals , and was extremely disciplined in his daily routine			0
and while i 'm not sure if any of that was because he 'd mostly grown up a chubby , single child , @entity54 points out that @entity3 found beauty in the number 143			1
according to the piece , @entity3 came " to see that number as a gift ... because , as he says , " the number 143 means ' i love you			1
' it takes one letter to say ' i ' and four letters to say ' love ' and three letters to say ' you			0
' one hundred and forty - three			0
he saved both public television and the vcr			1
when the government wanted to cut public television funds in 1969 , the relatively unknown @entity3 went to @entity91			1
almost straight out of a @entity98 film , his 5 - 6 minute testimony on how tv had the potential to give kids hope and create more productive citizens was so simple but passionate that even the most gruff politicians were charmed			0
while the budget should have been cut , the funding instead jumped from $ 9 to $ 22 million			0
@entity3 also spoke to @entity102 , and swayed senators into voting to allow @entity104 's to record television shows from the home			1
it was a cantankerous debate at the time , but his argument was that recording a program like his allowed working parents to sit down with their children and watch shows as a family			0
@entity0 : forgotten kids shows sure to give you nightmares 5			0
he might have been the most tolerant @entity119 ever			0
mister @entity3 seems to have been almost exactly the same off - screen as he was onscreen			1
as an ordained presbyterian minister , and a man of tremendous faith , mister @entity3 preached tolerance first			1
whenever he was asked to castigate non-christians or gays for their differing beliefs , he would instead face them and say , with sincerity , " @entity125 loves you just the way you are			0
" often this provoked ire from fundamentalists			0
he was genuinely curious about others			0
mister @entity3 was known as one of the toughest interviews because he 'd often befriend reporters , asking them tons of questions , taking pictures of them , compiling an album for them at the end of their time together , and calling them after to check in on them and hear about their families			1
he was n't concerned with himself , and genuinely loved hearing the life stories of others			2
and it was n't just with reporters			0
once , on a fancy trip up to a @entity157 exec 's house , he heard the limo driver was going to wait outside for 2 hours , so he insisted the driver come in and join them ( which flustered the host )			2
on the way back , @entity3 sat up front , and when he learned that they were passing the driver 's home on the way , he asked if they could stop in to meet his family			1
according to the driver , it was one of the best nights of his life the house supposedly lit up when @entity3 arrived , and he played jazz piano and bantered with them late into the night			1
further , like with the reporters , @entity3 sent him notes and kept in touch with the driver for the rest of his life			1
he was color - blind			0
he could n't see the color blue			0
of course , he was also figuratively color - blind , as you probably guessed			0
as were his parents , who took in a black foster child when @entity3 was growing up			1
@entity0 : praise for the blind genius who invented cruise control 8			0
he could make a subway car full of strangers sing			2
once while rushing to a @entity196 meeting , there were no cabs available , so @entity3 and one of his colleagues hopped on the subway			1
@entity20 reported that the car was filled with people , and they assumed they would n't be noticed			2
but when the crowd spotted @entity3 , they all simultaneously burst into song , chanting " @entity205 in the neighborhood			1
" the result made @entity3 smile wide			1
he got into tv because he hated tv			0
the first time he turned one on , he saw people angrily throwing pies in each other 's faces			0
he immediately vowed to use the medium for better than that			0
over the years he covered topics as varied as why kids should n't be scared of a haircut , or the bathroom drain ( because you wo n't fit ! ) , to divorce and war			2
he was an @entity227 dropout			0
@entity3 moved from @entity228 to @entity229 to pursue his studies in music			2
he composed all the songs on the show , and over 200 tunes			2
he was a perfectionist , and disliked ad libbing			0
he felt he owed it to children to make sure every word on his show was thought out			2
@entity241 got his start on the show as an assistant			1
he helped puppeteer and operate the trolley			2
several characters on the show are named for his family			2
queen @entity250 is named after @entity3 ' wife , and the postman mr. @entity252 is named for his maternal grandfather who always talked to him like an adult , and reminded young @entity255 that he made every day special just by being himself			1
sound familiar ? it was the same way @entity3 closed every show			1
every one of the cardigans he wore on the show had been hand - knit by his mother			2
