-- from 1984 to 1999 , @entity1 was in charge at @entity3 , an investment firm that sought out small and sometimes troubled companies that , with careful management and @entity3 - provided cash , offered the chance for big profits			1
@entity16 , like many venture capital firms , invested in startups with the hope that the profits they made on the successes would outweigh the losses they incurred on the failures			1
venture capital markets are simple things			1
two groups of people who want to create new businesses come together			0
venture capitalists have money but lack ideas			1
entrepreneurs have ideas but lack money			0
when they get together , they trade and new businesses are born			0
we praise entrepreneurs as forming the foundation of a vibrant economy but vilify venture capitalists as money - grubbing opportunists			1
entrepreneurs pour , sweat , blood and tears into their businesses , and we cheer them when it pays off			0
but we do n't see the risk venture capitalists take by investing in entrepreneurs , and so when venture capitalists strike it rich we assume the profit is ill - gotten gains			1
when entrepreneurs , empowered by venture capitalists , take new ideas and turn them into new products and businesses , job creation occurs			1
venture - backed businesses generate a large number of good jobs because businesses that require the financial muscle of venture capital usually require the intellectual muscle of highly skilled and educated labor			1
in 2008 , more than 80 % of the employees in the software industry , 74 % of employees in telecom , 75 % in semiconductors , and more than half in networking and electronics owed their jobs to venture capital , according to the @entity67			1
from the end of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010 , when the unemployment rate hovered stubbornly around 9 % , job postings by venture - backed companies rose 16 %			2
venture capitalists wo n't always get it right though			1
sometimes they 'll encourage companies to take on too much debt , or they 'll back ill - conceived business plans			0
when the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs make bad decisions , it hurts just as when the government makes a bad decision			2
but when venture capitalists and entrepreneurs make bad decisions , the people who are hurt are people who knowingly chose to invest , work for or do business with them			2
venture capital brings together expertise and prudence			2
they are an experienced and hands - on bunch of people			0
they do n't simply hand over money			0
they want spots on the boards of directors that give them the ability to monitor what the entrepreneurs are doing and to provide advice			0
and because it is often their personal money on the line , venture capitalists tend to be careful in considering the partnership of potential customers and entrepreneurs			1
most politicians do not have the business experience to offer meaningful and smart investment advice			0
no wonder the government stands to lose more than $ 500 million from investing in @entity121 , a @entity123 - based solar panel manufacturer that declared bankruptcy last year			0
if there is any chance of our economy returning to normalcy , it will require our politicians to start putting more faith in businesses			2
a good way to start is to stop vilifying venture capitalists			2
