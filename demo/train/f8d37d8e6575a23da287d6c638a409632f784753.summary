-- consumer demand for mobile media is growing fast , but the smartphone app market has quickly become heavily saturated and fairly confusing			1
perhaps one of the best ways for a company to increase its customer base is to go after the kinds of phones that the majority of mobile users in the @entity12 and elsewhere currently have -- feature phones			2
feature phones are usually cheaper devices that offer less computing ability than smartphones			2
this weekend , @entity17 acquired @entity18 , a platform that delivers @entity21 - based apps that run on most feature phone models			1
according to @entity24 , as of january 2011 only about 28 % of all mobile phones in the @entity12 were smartphones			0
this means 72 % of @entity12 cell phones are feature phones , most of which have a broad array of features , including the ability to run @entity21 - based apps			1
in january , @entity17 launched a @entity18 - powered feature phone app , which brought easier @entity17 access to more than 2,500 mobile devices worldwide			1
but so far , @entity17 's feature phone app is only for use in markets outside the @entity12 recently , the weblog @entity40 noted that feature phone apps make a lot of sense for companies seeking to grow their user base in emerging mobile markets worldwide			1
the market for feature phone apps represents a huge growth opportunity right here in the @entity12 so i would n't be surprised if @entity18 and other feature phone app platforms , such as @entity53 , start attracting more interest and investment and start rolling out richer offerings for @entity12 mobile users			1
the main reason for this is that most smartphone data plans are likely to remain pretty costly , and the majority of mobile users are very cost - conscious			0
increasing consolidation among @entity12 carriers wo n't bring monthly bills down			0
for instance , @entity67 's newly proposed acquisition of @entity68 would increase market consolidation by absorbing the lowest - cost major @entity12 carrier , which @entity72 believes will lead to rate increases for current @entity68 customers ( among other problems for consumers )			0
earlier this year , @entity77 announced that it 's making @entity79 the default browser on its @entity81 operating system , which powers a huge portion of @entity12 feature phones			2
this move will make web browsing much easier on feature phones , and it could spark a far greater appetite for mobile content and services among feature phone users			1
at the same time , feature phones are getting smarter and easier to use			0
for instance , the new @entity91 , available from @entity67 , emulates the @entity95 @entity94 interface , but it 's powered by @entity81 and it does n't require a two - year contract			0
when it comes to user experience , apps probably make much more sense on feature phones than smartphones in the long run			2
one of the great strengths of smartphones is their fully featured , easy - to - use web browsers			0
increasingly these will support @entity107 functionality , which allows web pages to work more like apps			0
since it 's much easier and cheaper to develop for the mobile web than for several native app platforms , a lot of smartphone services that are delivered mainly via apps today probably will migrate to a mobile browser experience			0
feature phones will probably always lag behind smartphones in terms of web browser usability			0
( @entity79 is nice and fast , but it 's definitely nowhere near the experience of @entity122 or @entity123			0
) so on feature phones , apps are probably the best way to deliver a richer and more user - friendly experience			2
of course , wireless carriers would have to play ball for the feature phone app market to grow			1
right now , carriers control which @entity21 - based apps customers can download onto feature phones			2
for the @entity12 feature phone app market to take off , carriers would have to loosen restrictions			1
i doubt @entity17 would have bought @entity18 if it only wanted to introduce apps outside of the @entity12 they 're probably also looking to get an early jump on a huge and largely underserved @entity12 consumer market			1
the feature phone app space is probably about to get very interesting			1
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity142 .			0

@entity17 just bought @entity18 , a platform for apps that run on feature phone models
about 72 % of @entity12 cell phones are feature phones
wireless carriers would have to play ball for the feature phone app market to grow
