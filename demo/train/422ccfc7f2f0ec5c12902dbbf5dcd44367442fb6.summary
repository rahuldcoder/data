a little more than a decade ago , @entity1 high school running back @entity2 was scoring touchdowns for the @entity5			2
on sunday , he 'll pilot an @entity7 helicopter over the @entity9 world championship			1
" i ca n't believe my son is flying over the @entity14 , " @entity10 told @entity3 on the phone from her home			1
you can understand why she 's so excited			1
around kickoff time , when opera star soprano @entity17 sings " ... and the home of the brave ... " 80,000 fans in the stands — and millions more on tv — will watch @entity2 and his eight fellow pilots soar high over @entity23 , @entity24 's , @entity25			1
does anyone you know ever get a chance to do that ? probably not			0
" it 's a once in a lifetime career opportunity that you get to do this , " @entity2 said in a phone call friday with @entity3			1
a bit of advice : do n't blink on sunday , or you might miss them and their amazing military hardware			1
you 'll see a v - shaped wedge formation of three workhorse @entity42 , three @entity45 attack helicopters and three @entity47 heavy - lifters — those are the big choppers with the double rotors whirling on top			1
total cost , the @entity51 tells @entity3 : about $ 100,000			1
military flyovers at the @entity14 have been around a while			1
the first was at 1968 's @entity55 , when @entity57 jets thrilled spectators at @entity60 's @entity59			1
related : unpublished photos of @entity62 @entity2 , like his eight comrades , has paid some dues to get here , ending up with a tour in @entity68			0
his journey started as a boy , dreaming of piloting aircraft			0
but at first @entity2 chose a more conventional path , considering a career as a veterinarian and then a pharmacist			0
he did stints at two universities , but it was no use			0
as his mom put it , " the flying thing just bit him			0
" @entity2 first soloed in a small plane in 2008 and then enrolled in commercial flight school			0
that meant packing up a car with his wife and young daughter and driving 2,500 miles to @entity89			0
after graduation @entity2 chose military service over an airline job			1
" he loves his country , and he wanted to serve , " his mom said			0
in 2012 , @entity2 left his then - pregnant wife and 7 - year - old daughter behind to join the war in @entity68			2
turns out , @entity2 was really good at flying @entity42 , his mom said			1
" i love helicopters , " @entity2 said			2
" and i like the versatility of the @entity100 , " especially hauling supplies and soldiers in and out of combat zones with the @entity104			0
as he put it , moving the " bullets and beans ... and troops			0
" flying a chopper in a war zone got a little hairy at times for some of the pilots in the unit , @entity2 said , but , " we knew what to do and how to react			0
" when @entity2 's tour ended last may , he returned to his base at @entity119 , @entity120 — and a newborn son			2
one night recently , @entity2 's mother was working her part - time second job at a department store , when her cell phone rang			1
" @entity2 said , ' @entity126 , i 'm calling to give you some good news ... i 'm going to fly my @entity100 over the @entity14			1
' i thought he was kind of teasing			0
i said , ' seriously , @entity129			0
" the band of brothers who 'll be flying sunday are all friends — a really tight - knit group , said @entity2 , part of @entity136 5 - 101 , " @entity134			1
" last year at this time , some of them were watching the @entity14 on tv half a world away			1
now they 're among the stars of the show			0
so , how does a military flyover at a football stadium work , exactly ? well , it 's tricky , especially in the @entity146 , which is the busiest aviation corridor in the nation			1
normally pilots flying in the region have to be aware of traffic from multiple airports , including @entity153 south of the stadium and @entity155 , which is north			0
let 's not forget the traffic from @entity157 and @entity158			2
but hey , this is the @entity14			1
basically the @entity161 has cleared the airspace on sunday			2
traffic : not a problem			0
next , good pilots always keep an eye on the weather			0
the game - time forecast calls for west to northwesterly winds at 10 mph with temperatures in the upper 30s or low 40s			2
although there 's a slight chance of light rain , @entity2 is confident conditions should be good enough to get the job done			2
then the hardest part : @entity2 and his fellow pilots have to time their flyover to the second			2
the mission : soar across the stadium during the final note of the " @entity186			2
" beginning at a holding area , @entity2 and his fellow pilots coordinate via radio with controllers on the ground			0
they know exactly how long it will take for them to reach their destination			0
in the military the procedure is called " time on target " — aka t.o.t. it 's all part of the job of being a military pilot			1
that 's just what we do , @entity2 said , " be at a specific place at a specific time			2
" come flyover time — back in @entity5 — @entity2 's friends and family plan to be watching			1
