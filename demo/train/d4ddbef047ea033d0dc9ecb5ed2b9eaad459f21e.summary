-- @entity2 driver @entity1 will start the @entity4 @entity3 in pole position after a breathtaking final qualifying session at @entity7			1
@entity1 narrowly beat teammate and rival @entity9 in to second place on the grid after both drivers broke course records			1
in the end , @entity1 prevailed by just 0.033 seconds			1
the season has , in many ways , been defined by the bitter rivalry between , and dominance of , @entity1 and @entity9			1
the former friends have locked horns , and clashed wheels , at a series of races , from @entity24 to @entity25 to @entity26 to @entity27			0
but going into the penultimate race of the season , @entity9 is 24 points ahead			1
most seasons this would put @entity9 in control of the championship			1
double jeopardy the introduction of double points for the final race in @entity39 has completely transformed the calculus			0
neither driver can win the championship in @entity4 but if @entity9 wins , and @entity1 fails to finish , double points means that the @entity25 could still steal the title from @entity45 despite being 49 points behind			1
" that was good and i am happy to be on pole , " @entity1 said in a press conference after the race			1
" it is the best place to start the race , but i have to do better than i did last week in @entity54 and convert this into a win			1
" @entity9 , for his part , was gracious in defeat			1
" congratulations to @entity1 , " he said			2
" he drove a really great lap and it was a truly thrilling session , just what qualifying is all about			0
every time i went out i had to go faster and improve and so did @entity1			2
i hope everyone enjoyed watching that			0
" but the biggest cheers were reserved for the @entity4 driver @entity67 , who was third fastest for @entity68			1
" that was very emotional for me , " @entity67 said			1
" i really felt the crowd with me today			0
" crowd sourced racing ? meanwhile , off the track , @entity73 denied that @entity75 is in the midst of a financial crisis			0
last week two teams effectively went out of business			0
@entity80 folded on friday whilst @entity81 went in to administration			0
neither team had appeared at the @entity85 or @entity4 races			2
" people say @entity75 is in crisis ... absolute nonsense , " @entity73 told @entity86			0
" we 've had a couple of teams in crisis			0
they need to know how much is coming in and how much is going out			0
maybe the major four or five teams can make a contribution for one year only			0
" the administrators taking charge of @entity81 's financial affairs had announced an innovative plan to allow the team to race at @entity39 : crowd source the necessary $ 3.7 million			2
@entity73 , however , was not impressed			0
" it 's up to the fans if that 's what they want to do / maybe people will put investment in the team , " he said			2
" i think it 's a disaster			2
