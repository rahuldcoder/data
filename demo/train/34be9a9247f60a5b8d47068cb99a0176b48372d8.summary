-- it was @entity3 's big moment , a chance to show how far the " noisy neighbors " from the blue half of town have come from under the shadows of their big rivals -- but the day of wild celebrations ended with a humble apology to one of football 's most iconic names			1
when @entity17 lifted a banner proclaiming " @entity23 " during a victory parade marking a 44 - year wait for an @entity22 league title , it brought into sharp focus comments by @entity26 manager @entity25 back in 2009			1
" not in my lifetime , " the @entity27 said when asked if his team would ever be underdogs against @entity3			2
@entity26 may not have been underdogs this season , but certainly had to play second fiddle as @entity3 won both league derby clashes and snatched the @entity34 crown from @entity25 's team in the final minutes of the campaign , if only by the narrowest of margins			1
@entity40 dreams : @entity41 celebrates title success city officials , to their credit , moved quickly to say sorry			2
" the creation of the tasteless material is in itself reprehensible and in accepting and brandishing it , @entity17 has made a significant error of judgment , " said a club spokeswoman			1
" the club wishes to express its sincerest apologies to sir @entity25 and @entity26 for any offense or distress caused			1
" @entity17 , who has history with @entity25 after his acrimonious departure from @entity58 to join @entity3 in 2009 , was also contrite			1
" i got carried away in the excitement of the moment and i certainly did n't mean any disrespect to sir @entity25 , who i admire as a man and a manager , " said the @entity60 international , who was given the banner by a supporter			1
did @entity3 win the title - or did @entity26 throw it away ? the incident took some of the gloss off an event that saw more than 100,000 people line the streets of @entity75 to celebrate @entity3 's triumph			1
however , chairman @entity77 was at pains to emphasize that the club 's first title since the @entity34 began 20 years ago is only a small step in the plans of @entity84 's @entity41 owners , especially in context of @entity26 's 12 championships in that period			1
" @entity26 set the benchmark for success for every club , " @entity77 said in an interview with @entity3 's website			1
" i have the highest respect for @entity26 and sir @entity25			1
to get 89 points and not win the league is unbelievable			2
" we are trying to accomplish just some of what @entity26 have been able to do in the past			2
we look at teams like @entity26 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 and what they mean to their cities			2
" this is one step in that direction but there is a long way to go yet			0
" @entity3 's success has come , in large part , due to a spending spree of hundreds of millions of dollars on star players such as @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity17 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , and there has been widespread speculation that @entity123 's @entity34 - leading scorer @entity122 will be the next big - money buy			1
but @entity77 said the future emphasis would be on developing a new training and academy facility to nurture talent to comply with @entity130 's new financial fair play rules			2
" we have a championship - winning team			0
we are not starting from the same point as in other preseasons , " @entity77 said			0
" we have had to improve in a very dramatic manner			0
now we have a nucleus of players who have won the @entity137 and the @entity34			0
to improve further we have to harness that nucleus and to improve in a tactical way			0
" you 're not going to see any major changes			0
there will be improvements but it will be in a very manageable way			0
" when you look at financial fair play , when you look at what the academy does for the community , how do we manage the evolution of this club over the next 10 years , it is fundamental to our growth strategy to have a continually successful program that produces young talent into the first team			2
" already today there are some wonderful young players in the academy and the reserve team , players who i think will be future superstars			0
" @entity77 said this season 's success will help further @entity3 's goal of becoming one of the world 's biggest clubs			1
" today we are a global brand , that was n't the case three years ago			0
we go to the @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity60 ... @entity3 has become an important club with a growing fan base , " he said			1
" if we are not there already , we are very close to being the most popular club in the @entity182			2
@entity183 is a huge market with a lot of potential and as @entity34 champions that gives us a lot of benefits , the same with @entity190			0
" manager @entity191 and his squad paraded the trophy on an open - top bus tour of the northern city on monday			2
to continuous chants of " champione " there was a massive roar when the team first emerged on a raised stage in front of the historic town hall			0
@entity191 and captain @entity204 received the biggest applause when they came out last , carrying the @entity34 trophy they had snatched from city rivals and defending champions @entity26 in the dramatic finale			1
@entity3 beat @entity210 3 - 2 sunday with two goals in stoppage time from @entity213 and @entity115 to edge out @entity26 , 1 - 0 winners at @entity215 , on goal difference			1
@entity217 star @entity204 told the gathered fans : " i want to say thank you , you guys have been amazing			0
" @entity191 added : " i think that you should be proud of these players			0
they did everything for you			0
they wanted to win this championship for you			2
" for @entity26 fans , there was also some consolation late monday when the club announced that veteran midfielder @entity230 would play on for another season			1
the 37 - year - old former @entity233 international midfielder came out of retirement midway through the campaign and starred for the former champions in several matches			0
however , @entity25 was not complimentary to @entity3 's spending policy when he talked about his postseason plans , with both clubs having been linked to young @entity217 star @entity241 -- who is expected to leave @entity243 club @entity242			1
" we know @entity3 are going to spend fortunes , pay stupid money and silly salaries			1
we ca n't do anything about that , " @entity25 told @entity26 's television channel			1
" we are not like other clubs who can spend fortunes on proven goods			2
we invest in players who will be with the club for a long time , who will create the character of the club and the excitement for our fans			0
we are good at that and we are going to continue that way			0
" meanwhile , controversial @entity210 midfielder @entity265 , who was sent off at the @entity266 for elbowing @entity17 in an off - the - ball incident , has been hit with two charges of violent conduct by the @entity270			2
@entity265 , who departed early in the second half to leave his team with 10 men , clashed with both @entity115 and @entity204 on his way off the pitch			0
and while @entity3 celebrated their title success , @entity277 manager @entity276 paid the price for a poor season which saw them narrowly avoid relegation			1
@entity277 , among the founding members of the @entity285 , announced in a statement monday that @entity276 had been sacked after just under a year in charge			0
the club 's @entity174 owner @entity288 gave his reasons in a statement on their official website			1
" we need to be clear and candid with ourselves and with supporters about what we have lacked in recent years			0
" compelling play and results that instil a sense of confidence that @entity277 is on the right track have been plainly absent			0
" @entity301 , manager of @entity302 who beat @entity277 2 - 0 on the last day of the season , is the early favorite to succeed fellow @entity306 .			0

@entity3 apologize for " tasteless " banner held up by @entity17 during parade
@entity311 read " @entity312 ' " referred to @entity26 manager @entity25
city chairman says the club 's policy of big signings will change after title win
however , @entity25 says @entity3 will continue to spend " stupid money "
