-- this week 's special unveiling the top @entity2 nominations was a 60 - minute encapsulation of the year in music : there was @entity6 , of course , a @entity9 sighting , a glimpse of @entity11 and another of @entity12			1
but the five - letter name on everyone 's lips was @entity16 , the @entity17 singer who picked up six nominations and managed to steal the show without even being there			1
screaming commenced when her name was mentioned , @entity23 reports , and the love was so widespread , her competition joined in			0
" she 's the coolest , most down - to - earth woman , and of course she has a voice like an angel and her album is incredible , " @entity12 , who 's also up for six @entity2 and is vying for album of the year with the singer , told @entity0			1
thinking about that , he joked , " damn it , why am i up against @entity16 ? ! " country singer @entity33 expressed his sympathies for " anybody who has to go up against @entity16			2
" he admitted , " i was actually hoping that if we did get a nomination , it would n't be any category with her in it			0
" ( his hopes came true : @entity33 is up for best country solo performance , best country duo / group performance and best country album honors			0
) the 23 - year - old @entity16 has had a banner year since releasing her second album , " 21 , " in february , and her singles " @entity47 " and " @entity48 " have been impossible to escape			1
( she 's had to cancel her remaining 2011 appearances to have throat - related surgery but is expected to make a full recovery			0
) but does her success make her unbeatable ? if not , then pretty close to it , industry observers say			1
spin magazine 's editor - in - chief , @entity55 , said he is fairly convinced			2
the @entity2 can surprise you , he said , but @entity16 is a unique artist			1
whereas some of her competitors may incite arguments about talent , " with @entity16 , you just have a singer , in the very classic sense , " @entity55 said			1
" she may not be your favorite , but you ca n't deny that she 's good at what she does			0
" frankly , he 's expecting the young star " to win everything that is n't nailed down			0
... every now and then there 's a juggernaut that 's the perfect mix of huge commercial success ( the album recently went quadruple platinum ) and critical acceptance			2
" that 's not to diminish the talents and achievements of the other players who are also in the running , said @entity82 , @entity84 's editorial director , but rather to view " 21 " as a different beast			0
" @entity86 ( @entity87 ) put out a really good album ; @entity86 and @entity89 put out a really good album ; @entity12 has emerged as a really powerful songwriter ; and @entity11 this year set @entity84 chart records			0
it 's been a phenomenal year for music , " @entity82 said			0
and yet , " when you talk about @entity16 's year , it 's hard to make the case , from a recorded music perspective , that anyone else is even in the same arena , " he continued			1
" what the @entity2 voters tend to love are albums that are both critically successful and commercially successful , and she is an arrow in the heart of that bull 's - eye this year			1
... it 's like @entity16 and everyone else when it comes to sales , and at the same time , she did it with an album that 's incredible			1
" to top it off , added @entity116 's managing editor , @entity115 , she 's got the back story : " this album ( ' 21 ' ) was born from heartache ; she was lovelorn			2
she 's an unlikely pop star in the first place , and then she goes on with this amazing voice to triumph , " @entity121 said			0
basically , she 's " served on a @entity2 platter			2
" of course , there are no guarantees			0
@entity121 said she sees the @entity127 bringing some heat for the industry darling in the album of the year category , and @entity82 noted that @entity2 predictions are hit - or - miss. " to be honest , i 'm expecting it to be a big night for @entity16 , " @entity82 said			1
" ( but ) it 's in the voters ' hands , and if i 've learned one thing about predicting @entity2 votes over the last 10 years , it 's that no one is particularly good at it			2
" interestingly enough , the artist consistently mentioned as the one who could have stepped on @entity16 's toes for album of the year is none other than @entity86 , who was n't even nominated in that category			1
the 34 - year - old rapper received seven nominations , including a song of the year nod for " @entity149 , " a category in which he 'll face @entity16 's " @entity47			1
" but it was the album of the year miss for @entity86 's " @entity153 " that left many incredulous			2
" @entity86 certainly deserved an album of the year nomination , and i was pretty surprised that he did n't , " @entity121 said			0
" i think if anyone could beat @entity16 in that category , it would be @entity86 , or at least rival her			2
but he did n't really have the momentum with this album as with previous albums , and certainly not in comparison to @entity16 's ' 21			1
' " ( @entity121 also has a theory that @entity86 may have split the vote by also putting out another critically recognized album with @entity89 , " @entity166			0
" ) if @entity86 had been nominated , said @entity167 , the race for the album of the year honor would 've been a tight one			0
as it stands though , he said , " if i 'm another nominee , i 'm happy to be there			0

industry observers says @entity17 singer @entity16 may be the one to beat at the @entity2
magazine editor says there 's no denying @entity16 's talent , even if you *'re* not a *fan*
@entity182 scored six nominations this year for her album " 21 "
