-- forget @entity2 special effects or @entity4 paintings -- some of the most stunning images are created by the mysterious and often violent forces in the universe			1
the @entity9 is about 3,800 light - years away in the constellation @entity11			1
witness the handful of new snapshots taken by the @entity14 , which was equipped with a new imaging camera during a space shuttle servicing mission in may			1
it 's back in business and there 's lots to ooh and aah over			0
" let there be no doubt , this is truly @entity14 's new beginning , " said @entity21 , @entity22 's associate administrator , during a news conference wednesday			2
take the image on the left of planetary nebula @entity9 , also known as the @entity9 or the @entity9			2
its " wings " are made of gas heated to more than 36,000 degrees @entity31 and there is a dying star at its center			2
" the gas is tearing across space at more than 600,000 miles an hour -- fast enough to travel from @entity39 to the moon in 24 minutes , " @entity22 's web site says			0
the " butterfly " is more than 2 light - years across			1
@entity22 took advantage of the special filters on @entity14 's camera to isolate the light of different elements , said @entity47 , chair of the science oversight committee for @entity49			1
the red in the image is nitrogen gas , for example , and the blue is oxygen			0
see some of the previous amazing images taken by @entity14 colors are also prominent in the image of globular star cluster @entity59 , which contains almost 10 million stars , but the color contrast here is real			1
the gold dots are stars like our sun , but the blue ones are extremely hot , while the red ones are cool , @entity47 said			0
" just by looking at the color of the stars in the picture , you can sort them by temperature and evolutionary state because the temperature differences here are caused by differences in the internal structure of these stars and in the kinds of fuels they 're burning deep inside of them , " @entity47 said			0
another image shows @entity85 , a group of five galaxies -- some of which are 290 million light - years away in the constellation @entity90			1
over time , those galaxies will eventually merge into a single big galaxy , @entity47 said			0
finally , images of a stellar nursery as seen in visible and infrared light reveal the secrets inside the @entity97 , located 7,500 light - years away			1
" this is a cloud of dense material which is being bombarded by intense radiation from surrounding stars , " @entity47 said			0
" but dissolve to infrared and the cloud disappears			0
... an energetic infant star is being formed inside this cloud			0
" @entity14 is expected to continue its mission for at least five more years .			2

@entity14 was equipped with a new imaging camera in may
