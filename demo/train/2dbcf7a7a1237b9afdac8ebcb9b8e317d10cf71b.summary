-- saturday 's discovery of a pulse signal in the search for @entity4 marks yet another potential breakthrough in the mystery of the plane 's disappearance			1
officials hope this lead will be unlike the others -- which so far have yet to locate the aircraft , which is believed to be at the bottom of the @entity16			2
but all of the past month 's leads , whether genuine or false , have made for a dramatic narrative in how a commercial airliner could vanish while carrying 239 people			1
march 8 @entity4 takes off just after midnight from @entity21 for @entity22			1
the @entity23 disappears within an hour of takeoff , following verbal communication with air traffic controllers			0
ground eyewitnesses , however , claim they saw the plane			0
they are an oil rig worker in the @entity30 , fishermen in @entity32 and @entity33 , and islanders in @entity35			0
but all those accounts are eventually proven to be false			1
march 9 a @entity38 reconnaissance plane spots oil slicks that stretch between six and nine miles in the @entity30 , the same body of water where @entity4 dispatched its last communication from the cockpit within the first hour of its takeoff			1
the slick turned out to be fuel oil typically used in cargo ships			0
meanwhile , other sightings of a plane door and its tail also prove untrue			0
march 14 citing " satellite information " and giving scant details , @entity32 officials say they are focusing their attention on two massive " arcs " on both sides of the equator			0
they release a map to the press and , suddenly , the search for the plane covers a vast canvas of the @entity63			2
the plane could have taken either path -- which means the search area now blankets 2.97 million square miles , nearly equivalent to the size of the continental @entity67			2
the northern arc stretches over @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
speculation turns toward whether the plane actually landed to the north , but officials later dismiss this arching route as the possible location of the plane			0
no crashes , or even a sighting of a wayward @entity81 , have been reported			2
moreover , this north corridor flies through tightly guarded airspace over @entity84 , @entity85 and even @entity67 military installations in @entity87 , and no one has reported a rogue plane			2
that leaves the southern arc : it stretches from @entity33 to the southern @entity16			0
this becomes a solid lead for investigators			2
but it raises a gargantuan question : how do you find a plane in an ocean ? march 18 the @entity101 military reveals the plane had virtually reversed course and took a sharp turn -- westward , toward the @entity104			2
the @entity32 government says evidence suggest the plane was deliberately flown off - course and traveled back over the @entity108 and out into the @entity16			2
it 's another good lead in the hunt for the missing plane			1
the @entity101 information bolsters the search in the southern arc , over the @entity16			2
but a search of the @entity104 yields nothing			2
march 19 a @entity67 official familiar with the investigation tells @entity0 that based on present search patterns and available data , it 's far more likely that the plane would be located in the southern arc			1
based on @entity67 data about the jet 's fuel reserves , @entity123 authorities conduct a search about 1,600 miles off their western coast			1
in fact , investigators spot two objects in the @entity16 that could be related to the missing plane , @entity123 officials say			1
it 's the best lead for the moment			1
the @entity137 and @entity67 aircraft are sent to investigate -- but the search area is so far from land , that the planes can only search for two to three hours before they have to return to land for refueling			2
march 22 three days later , a land - and - sea search involving several countries continues for any sign of debris off @entity123			1
the hunt is even taking place in outer space -- with satellite photos of the surface below			0
@entity123 prime minister @entity152 says there 's no shortage of leads -- just no results			1
he 's optimistic , however			2
" we have now had a number of very credible leads , and there is increasing hope -- no more than hope , no more than hope -- that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill - fated aircraft , " @entity152 says			1
still , there 's no sight of the reported two parcels			1
experts wonder whether the two objects were part of the junk swirling in a vast @entity174 , or rotating currents			2
march 23 @entity177 's @entity176 cites radar data from a satellite showing material floating in the @entity16 about 1,430 miles off @entity180 , @entity123			1
in all , the satellite images by a @entity177 defense firm show 122 floating objects			1
could this be signs of the wreckage ? the problem is , they 're scattered over 154 square miles , about the size of @entity189 , @entity190			0
march 26 search aircraft spotted three objects drifting in the sea , @entity123 officials say			1
but search teams are n't able to locate them on subsequent passes , officials add			2
it 's the same story with two objects spotted by a civil aircraft			1
and a blue object sighted by a @entity203 military plane			0
none could be found again on a second pass			0
if that 's not enough , a @entity101 satellite locates 300 floating objects , including a big one measuring 50 feet by 6 feet , @entity101 officials say			1
they are just 125 miles from the @entity177 satellite 's sighting of 122 objects			1
then , the @entity214 government says one of its intelligence satellites identified 10 floating objects , the largest of which is 13 feet by 26 feet			1
they 're also floating near the other satellite sightings , some 1,550 miles off western @entity123			1
there are so many leads , it 's dizzying			1
perhaps the day 's most dispiriting news is that crews ca n't find a 75 - foot - long object that was captured in satellite images provided by @entity226			1
could it have been part of the plane 's wing , experts asked ? the only good news is there 's no shortage of potential clues			2
the bad news is , nothing comes of them			0
march 27 the search moves to a different patch of the ocean -- 680 miles northeast of the primary area of focus -- because of " a new credible lead " provided by @entity32 investigators , @entity123 officials say			1
the new information is based on an analysis of radar data on the day the plane disappeared and suggests the aircraft was traveling faster than previously estimated before it dropped off radar , the @entity247 said			0
this means the plane burned fuel faster , shortening its maximum possible distance over the southern @entity16			0
the advantage is the search moves closer to the @entity123 coast , making the area easier for planes to reach			1
@entity263 can now spend more time searching			0
march 28 aircraft spot possible debris in the new search field			2
in fact , @entity0 's @entity267 is embedded aboard a @entity203 military plane that sights 11 small objects drifting at sea			1
" at one point , sure , everybody on board got a little excited , but it 's impossible to tell from that distance what anything is , " she says			2
but it 's the same story : a dead end			2
march 29 a @entity71 war ship and a second vessel retrieve objects from the ocean , @entity123 officials say			1
also , a @entity71 plane crew drops buoys to mark three suspected debris sites , @entity71 's state - run media reports			1
but they 're all blind alleys leading to nowhere			0
some of the objects retrieved by the ships were merely fishing gear			2
march 30 @entity123 aircraft put an eye on four orange items bobbing in the water			1
crews take photos and send back coordinates			0
one item is 6.5 feet long			0
the discovery become one of the " most promising leads " in the new search area , says @entity123 flight lt. @entity306			1
but it ends as a hope dashed			0
the promise does n't deliver			0
@entity123 prime ministry @entity152 stands undaunted , however			1
" we are searching a vast area of ocean , and we are working on quite limited information			0
nevertheless , the best brains in the world are applying themselves to this task , " @entity152 says			0
" if this mystery is solvable , we will solve it			0
" the search , however , is now approaching its fourth week			0
april 2 under growing criticism at home , @entity32 prime minister @entity320 pledges to get to the bottom of the plane mystery -- if not the ocean itself			0
" we want to provide comfort to the families , and we will not rest until answers are indeed found , " he says			0
the mission , however , could last longer than initially thought			0
" we 'll keep going til hell freezes over , " @entity331 , @entity123 's former defense minister and current ambassador to the @entity67 , tells @entity0			1
" it could take months , it could take years			0
" april 4 time is running out			0
the plane 's black box -- the cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- has enough battery life to last 30 days , at most			0
after 30 days , the black box 's locator beacons -- known as pingers -- will die			0
in other words , the plane will no longer be able to make an electronic cry for help			0
we 're now on day 28			0
saturday , april 5 crews are now searching for the plane on a prayer that the pingers will last long enough for search teams to find them			1
will that miracle arrive ? as if a godsend , a pulse is heard rising from the @entity16 by a @entity71 ship in the search area , @entity123 officials say			1
the pulse carries the same standard beacon frequency as the black box : @entity362 , according to a @entity364 correspondent aboard the @entity365 ( pronounced " high shuen " )			0
the @entity71 ship heard it for a minute and a half but could n't record it , a @entity369 - based @entity368 newspaper reports			0
after so many false starts , has the revelatory lead finally arrived ? it 's not out of the question , experts say .			1

the long list of leads in the search for @entity4 spins a dramatic narrative
all of the reported objects floating in the ocean have proven to be false leads
the best leads have now placed the search closer to @entity123 's west coast
has the case - breaking lead finally arrived with a discovery of a pulse signal ?
