@entity0 -- the burst of enthusiasm for the " @entity4 " debt reduction plan as a way out of the debt ceiling crisis has appeared to fade as @entity9 and @entity10 lawmakers studied and found fault with the details of the proposal			1
most notably , both sides highlighted well - worn party - line divisions : conservatives complained the plan would raise taxes while liberals warned it would cut entitlement benefits			1
" it would be irresponsible for us to try to rush through such a complex package without time for meaningful review , " said sen. @entity21 , the top @entity10 on the @entity22 who said his staff has already identified " serious flaws " with the proposal			1
" this great ' @entity4 ' would save $ 4 trillion over 10 years , " rep. @entity29 , a @entity30 from @entity31 , said sarcastically			2
" seniors will pay more			0
working people will pay more			0
@entity36 people not so much			0
but it would save $ 4 trillion over 10 years			0
" despite some strong pushback from liberal groups and labor unions to the proposed changes to entitlement programs , @entity39 @entity38 seemed to leave the door open to the plan , telling reporters , " we have n't seen it but it has some good principles in it			1
" @entity54 @entity10 aides acknowledged some of the ideas for tax reform and spending cuts are similar to @entity10 - backed plans			1
but the aides privately cringed when president @entity60 endorsed the proposal on tuesday , because his very public embrace makes it even tougher to sell to @entity54 conservatives			0
@entity65 @entity10 @entity64 , leader of a large block of @entity54 conservatives , dismissed the proposal			1
he pointed to @entity54 passage of the " cut , cap , and balance " bill , which would make raising the debt ceiling contingent on congressional passage of a balanced budget amendment to the @entity72			0
" forget the ' @entity4 , ' let 's go with the ' @entity76 , ' " @entity64 said , referring to the winning number of votes for the measure			1
he said the " @entity4 " plan was a nonstarter for him and for the members of the @entity83			2
" in simple terms : our guys do n't like it , " he said			0
with growing signs that the monthslong work would not provide the key to avoiding default , @entity9 and @entity10 leadership aides in the @entity93 sought to turn attention back to a last - ditch plan developed by @entity97 @entity96 and @entity97 @entity98			1
that plan , which is still not finalized , would allow the president to seek an increase in the $ 14.3 trillion debt limit without the approval of @entity104 , set up a special committee to recommend ways to reduce the debt and possibly include a trillion dollars or more in immediate spending cuts			0
however , as the august 2 deadline approaches , even that backup proposal appeared in trouble as @entity10 continued to say it would not get the votes needed to pass the @entity10 - controlled @entity54			2
house speaker @entity115 and majority leader @entity116 met wednesday with the top two @entity117 , @entity38 and @entity119			0
congressional aides said the leaders talked about the @entity123 plan , among other proposals			1
while @entity54 leaders met to consider next steps in the debt impasse , @entity10 freshmen continued to insist they were in no mood to compromise			0
@entity131 @entity10 @entity130 said he and others want to pass something that 's " transformative , " not something that kicks the can down the road to another committee to study how to reduce the debt			2
asked about the @entity123 plan 's prospects in the @entity54 , @entity130 told reporters bluntly , " if there a state or condition worse than death , that 's what it is			1
i ca n't think of one , so we 'll just go with death for now			0
" some senators said they would like to tie elements of the " @entity4 " proposal to the @entity123 measure as a way to salvage the group 's work and to keep open the possibility of deeper reductions in the debt			1
@entity161 said one idea is to allow a vote on the gang 's work if the special committee set up under the @entity123 bill fails to reach agreement on ways to reduce the debt			2
" what i would like to see is that this plan gets a vote , " @entity161 said			0
@entity175 @entity9 sen. @entity174 said it makes sense to tie the @entity123 plan with elements from the " @entity4 " proposal			1
" that seems to be the most likely formula for a successful completion , " @entity174 said			0
rep. @entity184 , a moderate @entity10 from @entity65 , said he was encouraged by the " @entity4 " proposal but has concerns about how parts of it would work			1
joking with reporters , he said both @entity93 compromises are n't exactly being embraced by @entity190			0
" the @entity192 plan is less popular than the " @entity4 " plan , but both of them come in at about the approval rating of the @entity104 , " he said .			2

conservatives do n't like plan 's tax increases , while liberals do n't like proposed entitlement cuts
*democrats* , @entity10 sought to turn attention back to the @entity123 plan
some want to tie elements of " @entity4 " proposal to @entity123 measure
