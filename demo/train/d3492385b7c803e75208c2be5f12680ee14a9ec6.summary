in the past week , we 've seen an 80 - year - old basketball franchise owner fall under the weight of racist comments about banning blacks and @entity5 from his arena , and a 73 - year - old @entity9 rancher implode after saying blacks would be better off picking cotton			1
so , does that mean we are finally coming to the end of all of this ? once these octogenarian white men from another time die off , will we finally be free of empirical racism in @entity18 ? doubt it			1
i 'm a young guy -- 24			1
i went to @entity21 in @entity22			1
i hang out with the basketball team ( in fact , i am @entity21 's first play - by - play announcer for our home games			1
my friends are of mixed background			2
but i also see others around me who , on the surface , may roll with a similar crowd , listen to the same music , say the right things , but who are also slowly being infected with the @entity18 disease of racial bias			1
i hear the subtle signs of racism on talk radio or on the @entity42 , where coded language of " quotas " and " boot - straps " is used in substitution of the old phrases of " ghettos " and " laziness			1
" i read the @entity51 feeds and troll the comment boards , listening to how those of like mind cluster together , reinforcing their own points of view			1
but we 've got a black president , right ? it 's all good , right ? yes , racism , in less than a half - century , has largely gone from commonplace to taboo			1
if you are a 67 - year - old beloved cooking show star who admits to having used the n - word , there are going to be consequences			2
if you own a nearly all - black @entity67 team yet verbalize a disgust for african - americans , you 're going to get checked			2
today , any controversial statement , once exposed to the disinfectant of sunlight and mass media , gets met with immediate backlash			2
@entity77 owner @entity76 learned this firsthand when @entity67 commissioner @entity79 banned him for life			1
cue applause , drop the mic , walk off the stage			2
sure , we have come a long way			2
from the days when my father , a leading real estate inspector in @entity89 , could n't live in certain areas or shop in certain stores , to today , when i can graduate from a leading university , enter the field of media , and truly believe i have a chance to exceed my dreams , a lot has changed			2
but , for my generation , there are still real problems			1
we do n't truly understand our history			2
and too often do we go from captivated to uninterested overnight , distracted by the next shiny object or hot internet meme			2
we @entity104 are the " here today , gone tomorrow " type of activists			2
this is most disappointing because access of information is easier than ever before			1
you no longer have to be rich or famous to have a voice			2
just get a @entity51 handle , post to your @entity114 page or fire up a @entity116 blog			2
so the question becomes , what happens next ? we can not simply stand idly by celebrating surface victories while the problems persist			0
@entity123 , as with all other prejudices , has to be attacked at the source			0
it will not become extinct with the passing of the older generations			0
a new racist is born every minute			0
i went to a largely white high school in the western suburbs of @entity89			0
when i was younger , maybe 10 or 11 , i got into a fight with a neighbor kid who had just called me that magic word -- the " n " word			1
parents intervened , the skirmish ceased , and each of us was swiftly scolded			0
now it 's quite obvious where he learned the word			1
he was n't born saying it ; someone had to teach it to him			0
that kid is much older now , also in his mid- 20s			0
i have n't seen him since , but i wonder what 's in his head now ? is he growing up to become the next @entity76 or @entity152 or @entity153 ? or has time and society shifted his adolescent feelings about me and others like me ? it must be remembered that racism is not an innate trait			1
it is a learned characteristic			1
we see it on tv			0
we hear it on the radio			0
we watch it coming from our parents			0
i just hope my generation has made that kind of an education a little less desirable			1
within our generation are the remnants of a time long past			1
today , we live in an age of tolerance			0
yet everything is moving 100 miles per hour			0
that 's one of the big differences between generations past and @entity104			1
for us , technology is a given			1
but it 's also an opportunity			0
it provides an unprecedented level of exposure and opportunity to interact with others not like ourselves			0
in our generation a six - second vine clip has the potential to become the lead story on the news , and what we do at a party or a game or in school can be celebrated or scorned with the click of a " like " button			1
but we 've got next			0
there is a changing of the guard coming in our society , and our number is coming up			0
so now , it falls upon a generation of young people to see the fight through			1
we are trapped in between two worlds , the new and the old			0
our choices will shape the future			0
it is our duty as a generation to teach ourselves discipline			1
to know right from wrong , unacceptable from appropriate			0
this wo n't be on @entity76 's generation			1
it will be on us			0
it is our duty to wash out the ignorant tendencies of our forebears across the board , regardless of race			0
dedication will be required , along with an attention span that lasts longer than 140 characters			0
join us on @entity233 / @entity232 .			0

@entity235 looks at the generational differences in racial *attitudes* in @entity18
racism is a learned *behavior* , he says , that his generation must fight to *unlearn*
@entity235 : technology exposes us to new ideas but makes it easier for like thinkers to cluster
