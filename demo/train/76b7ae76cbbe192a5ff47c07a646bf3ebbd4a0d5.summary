-- @entity1 put an end to capital punishment wednesday as gov. @entity4 signed legislation abolishing the practice and commuting the sentences of his state 's remaining death row inmates			1
the move came 11 years after a spate of death - row exonerations prompted one of @entity4 's predecessors to halt executions			1
in announcing his decision , @entity4 said that a flawed system of capital punishment had put the state in " grave danger " of putting innocent prisoners to death and that creating a " mistake - free " system was impossible			1
" having said that , we can not have a death - penalty system in our state which kills innocents , and unfortunately our system was in grave danger of doing exactly that in 20 instances , " he said			2
@entity1 conducted its last execution in 1999			1
then - gov. @entity32 , a @entity33 , halted executions in 2000 after revelations that 20 death - row convicts were not guilty of the crimes that put them there			1
@entity32 commuted 167 death sentences to life in prison without parole , and @entity4 commuted another 15 on wednesday			2
@entity4 's move leaves 34 states and the federal government with capital punishment on the books			2
@entity1 is the third state to abolish the practice since 2007 , and a court ruling struck down @entity52 's death - penalty law in 2004			1
@entity4 , a @entity53 , took office after the 2009 impeachment of gov. @entity56 and won a full term in november			1
during the campaign , he said he would support keeping the death penalty for the " most severe " crimes			0
but he said wednesday that he had " no regrets " about his decision			0
" i think it 's the right and just thing to abolish the death penalty and punish those who commit heinous crimes , evil people , with life in prison without parole or any chance of release , " said @entity4			1
several prosecutors and the @entity73 had lobbied to keep the death penalty , arguing that reforms passed after @entity32 's moratorium had improved the system and that the threat of execution deterred crime			0
@entity80 , the state fop president , said execution should remain a potential punishment in " extreme cases " like the killing of a police officer or a child			2
and police and prosecutors have used the threat of the death penalty to help obtain a suspect 's cooperation , he said			0
" the criminal , when they know their cooperation in an investigation will yield that case not being forwarded to the death penalty , they might be more cooperative			0
and we 've seen that many times , " @entity80 said			0
he predicted opponents in the legislature would try to reinstate capital punishment before long			0
" i believe it 's going to prove over time to be problematic , " @entity80 said			0
and state sen. @entity103 , one of several @entity104 to oppose repeal , said @entity4 should have pushed for a statewide debate and a referendum on whether to keep capital punishment			1
" this removes a remedy of the people of @entity1 for great and evil acts of a unique kind : wanton cruelty , terrorism , rape and murder , the butchery of small children , mass murder , " said @entity103 , from the southern city of @entity109			2
" it removes a remedy for the community to seek the penalty of death in which someone forfeits one 's life for these great wrongs committed to innocent people			0
" but @entity4 's decision drew swift praise from the @entity133 , which called it a " historic stand " by the governor and state lawmakers			1
" executions in this country are carried out as part of an unequal system of justice , in which innocent people are too often sentenced to death and decisions about who lives and who dies are largely dependent upon the skill of their attorneys , the race of their victim , their socioeconomic status and where the crime took place , " @entity138 , director of the @entity139 , said in a statement issued after @entity4 's announcement			1
" such arbitrary and discriminatory administration of the death penalty , which comes at an enormous financial cost to taxpayers , is the very definition of a failed system , and the state of @entity1 is to be commended for ending it			1
" and the @entity168 of @entity1 said abolishing the death penalty " advances the development of a culture of life in our state			2
" " no longer will there be a risk in @entity1 that an innocent person will be convicted and sentenced to death			0
the law becomes effective on july 1 , 2011 , " the conference said in a written statement			0
it added , " @entity182 will continue to be protected and those who commit crimes will still be held accountable through alternatives to the death penalty , including life without parole			0
