-- amid conservative opposition , a bill that would designate a day of " significance " in @entity4 for slain gay politician @entity5 is heading to gov. @entity7 's desk			1
@entity5 was @entity4 's first openly gay elected official			1
he was assassinated in 1978			0
the legislation would denote may 22 -- milk 's birthday -- as a day of significance across the state			1
the governor 's office said tuesday it had received more than 100,000 constituent phone calls about the bill , although it was not immediately clear if most were in favor of it or opposed			1
the governor 's office said @entity7 has not taken a position on it yet			1
milk , the state 's first openly gay elected official , served briefly as @entity24 's supervisor before he and mayor @entity25 were assassinated in 1978			2
@entity7 vetoed a similar bill last year , saying he believed milk " should be continued to be recognized at the local level by those who were most impacted by his contributions			2

milk was a " unique " historical figure who led a civil rights movement and then was " assassinated in his public office for being who he was , " @entity32 said			1
" in a perfect world , we 'd have a state holiday for him , like [ the @entity51 ] @entity50 or @entity52 , " @entity32 said in a telephone interview			0
but the @entity4 state finances are in such " disarray ... we think it 's appropriate in light of our fiscal crisis " to have a special day of significance that wo n't cost the state anything , said @entity32 , whose district includes portions of @entity24			2
that way , he said , milk is still afforded " the respect that he 's due			0
" the day of significance would not close schools or state offices , according to its text			2
however , @entity71 , the president of @entity72 , said the bill was vague and could allow for a number of things at schools , including gay pride parades or " mock gay weddings			1
" " there 's no definition in the bill , " he said			0
" there is absolutely no limit to what could occur on campuses and go into little children 's brains			0
" " @entity5 was a terrible role model for children , " @entity71 said			0
his organization plans to oppose the bill through automatic phone calls , e-mails , media interviews and news conferences , he added			0
@entity32 said that claims that the bill would lead to schools holding gay - pride parades and similar activities were " hyperbole			1
" the bill " mandates nothing , " he said , although it certainly " affords an educational opportunity			0
" president @entity103 also posthumously honored milk with a @entity105 this year , and @entity106 portrayed him in this year 's film " milk , " which garnered him an @entity108 for best actor			0
