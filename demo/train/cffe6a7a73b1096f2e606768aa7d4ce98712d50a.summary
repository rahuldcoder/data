-- there is something magical about animal migrations			1
perhaps it 's the fact that as more of us move to cities ( the @entity11 predicts that nearly 70 % of the global population will be urban dwellers by 2050 ) , the sight of congregating herds , schools of fish , or flocks of birds is increasingly rare			2
or maybe witnessing animals cross great distances to eat , mate , breed and , in essence , survive helps us to take stock of our own lives			1

in fact , the annual phenomenon has earned @entity33 the nickname " butterfly town "			1
" i always hear that the monarchs are coming before i ever see one			2
i get emails saying , ' i saw my first monarch of the season ! ' everyone wants to be the one to herald their return , " says @entity48 , executive director of the @entity49			2
the season sees an influx of tourists as well			2
during the winter months , nearly 100,000 visitors come to witness the spectacle			0
the last few years has seen a drastic decline in their population , a fact some credit with the degradation of milk weed -- the only flora monarchs can lay their eggs on			0
to help restore the population , many locals have started replanting the stuff , while the local government has instilled a $ 1,000 fine for disturbing a monarch			1

from may through july , millions of sardines spawn in the @entity90 and make their way north up the coast			0
the migration also attracts predators , both of the human and animal variety			1
each year , thousands of locals and tourists perch with massive fishing nets to catch the unwitting fish			1

where : @entity83 when : may - july sign of the wildebeest while tourism is n't always a welcome phenomenon for environmentalists , there are some instances where conservation efforts are abetted by traveler interest			1
in the @entity121 , for instance , the tens of thousands of visitors that stream in july and august for the @entity121 ( so called for the millions of wildebeests that trek from @entity124 to @entity125 ) actually help to ensure funding goes to conservation			0
" you could argue that tourism is one of the major reasons this huge ecosystem still exists today , " says @entity128 , the vice president of philanthropy and marketing at the @entity131			0
at the peak of the migration , the banks of the @entity138 are lined with hundreds of vehicles packed with environmental voyeurs all eager to glimpse the beasts make the life - threatening swim across the currents			2

" it looks like someone came along and planted all these crabs overnight , " explains @entity156 , the marketing manager at @entity157			0
when the crabs come out , the atmosphere becomes positively festive , notes @entity163			0

where : @entity150 when : october - november a whale of a time as it happens , humpback whales are a species constantly on the move			1
this is good news for tourists , who have a plethora of choice for where and when they 'd like to engage in whale watching activities			0
