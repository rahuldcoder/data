could a wooden marionette help solve @entity2 's budgetary woes ? with @entity2 's declaration on thursday of bankruptcy , some of the city 's creditors may think so			1
the museum of the @entity9 , home to 60,000 pieces of art , is also home to the original @entity15 marionette puppet that was the star of its own 1950s - era children 's show			1
it was acquired in 2001 , according to the @entity21 's director of communications			0
" it is estimated that the marionette could sell at auction for $ 400,000 to $ 500,000 , " said @entity22 , a puppet collector who was featured on the television program " @entity24			0
" that would hardly make a dent in the city 's immense $ 18 billion debt			1
but , despite an opinion from the state 's attorney general that appeared to assure @entity36 would stay , legal experts say there 's still a risk he could wind up packing his bags and riding into the sunset with many of the museum 's other residents			1
the arts institute 's director , @entity45 , maintains that @entity21 's collection is among the top six in the @entity49			2
while he could not specify a value , @entity45 told @entity51 in may that it would likely be in the billions of dollars			0
it was then that that a request by @entity2 's emergency manager , @entity55 , for an inventory of holdings sparked alarm among @entity2 residents and museum administrators that the @entity21 's collection could be sold to help pay off the city 's debt			1
then , in june , @entity64 attorney general @entity63 issued an opinion stating that @entity2 ca n't sell the @entity21 's art , although the city technically owns the collection			1
" it is my opinion , therefore , that the art collection of the @entity9 is held by the @entity2 in charitable trust for the people of @entity64 , and no piece in the collection may thus be sold , conveyed , or transferred to satisfy city debts or obligations , " @entity63 told @entity51 in a written statement			1
he said that he recognized the extreme financial hardships the city is experiencing , and the challenges the city faces , but argued that selling the artwork would " damage not only the city 's but the state 's cultural commonwealth			2
" but the opinion could be for naught , said @entity90 of @entity91 prior to thursday 's declaration			2
" it 's certainly better than nothing , but a state attorney general 's opinion is certainly not going to be definitive in federal bankruptcy court , " @entity90 said			1
" i do n't think that is going to carry a huge amount of weight			0
" @entity101 , a law professor at @entity102 in @entity2 , echoed that sentiment			2
" he just issued an opinion , which is not binding on anyone and certainly has no legal effect in a bankruptcy case , " she said			2
" a bankruptcy judge may or may not find it persuasive on the merits of its analysis , but it has no binding effect			0
" @entity116 , spokesman for emergency manager @entity55 , said that " nothing is being considered for sale			0
" " all of the city 's creditors have asked about the @entity21 and whether it has been valued -- it has not -- and some creditors have said everything that is n't nailed down should be sold to pay them , " @entity116 wrote in an e-mail to @entity51			2
" that wo n't happen because the emergency manager 's proposed restructuring plan is focused on restoring essential city services			0
" however , @entity2 's creditors say promises were made and debts must be paid			1
" if they 're talking about not being solvent when they have these assets , they do still have some degree of solvency by selling these assets , " said @entity131 , a managing director at @entity132 , an investment management corporation whose investors are owed approximately $ 200 million by the city of @entity2			1
even as signs of the coming bankruptcy grew stronger , the @entity21 's officials remained resolute in their determination to protect their collection			1
" our position has n't changed			0
we only sell works of art to buy works of art , " @entity45 said			0
" we are not given works of art so that we can settle debts made ( during ) decades of mismanagement and corruption			0
" @entity15 is a marionette in the image of a freckled - face boy dressed in cowboy attire			0
" the @entity15 " ran on @entity158 from 1947 to 1960			0
one of @entity162 creator @entity161 's @entity160 puppets is also among the @entity21 's puppet collection , which boasts around 800 pieces			1
the @entity21 was founded in 1885 and houses more than 100 galleries , a lecture and recital hall , an art reference library , and a state - of - the - art conservation laboratory , according to the museum 's website .			0

despite an opinion from @entity64 's attorney general , @entity15 may be moving
the city of @entity2 owns @entity36 and many other puppets
a court may make @entity15 part of the booty in the bankruptcy
museum officials remain resolute in their determination to protect their collection
