@entity0 -- @entity2 , the @entity1 host and @entity5 columnist , has returned a prestigious prize to the @entity7 , another rebuke for the esteemed civil rights group 's opposition to an @entity12 center near ground zero			1
@entity2 , who received the @entity7 's @entity15 @entity14 five years ago , gave back the honor to @entity7 for publicly siding " with those urging the relocation " of the center , which would be located near the site of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
" i can not in good conscience hold onto the award or the honorarium that came with it and am returning both , " he said			2
it is the latest in a wave of stinging criticism toward the @entity32 organization 's position from a range of people and groups , including those in the @entity32 community , and the @entity7 said it was " saddened and stunned " by @entity2 's decision			1
the @entity7 , which exists to fight discrimination , especially anti-semitism , has said the center 's backers had " every right to build at this site " and that " the bigotry some have expressed in attacking them is unfair , and wrong			1
but at the same time , it said " that building the center at the site will cause some victims more pain -- unnecessarily -- and that is not right			2
" m in a letter dated friday to @entity7 national director @entity52 , @entity2 explained that he had been " delighted and moved " to be picked for the award " because of the high esteem " he had for the @entity7			1
" i have always been impressed by the fact that your mission is broad -- ' to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens ' -- and you have interpreted it broadly over the decades			0
you have fought discrimination against all religions , races , and creeds and have built a well - deserved reputation , " @entity2 said			2
that 's why , he said , he was " stunned " that the @entity7 used its " immense prestige to take a side that is utterly opposed " to its own " animating purpose			1
" he said the group 's statements that it " must honor the feelings of victims even if irrational or bigoted , made matters worse			2
" @entity2 said he hopes his move will complement those who are urging the @entity7 " to reconsider and reverse " its stance			1
" this decision will haunt the @entity7 for years if not decades to come			2
whether or not the center is built , what is at stake here is the integrity of the @entity7 and its fidelity to its mission			2
admitting an error is a small price to pay to regain your reputation , " he said			0
@entity52 responded with a letter to @entity2 , saying he 's " not only saddened but stunned and somewhat speechless by your decision			1
" " as someone i greatly respect for engaging in discussion and dialogue with an open mind , i would have expected you to reach out to me before coming to judgment , " @entity52 said			0
@entity52 reiterated that the group is n't opposing the right for an @entity12 center or a mosque to be built and that it has and will continue to stand up for @entity110 and others who are " targets of racism and bigotry			1
" " what we did was to make an appeal based solely on the issues of location and sensitivity			0
if the stated goal was to advance reconciliation and understanding , we believe taking into consideration the feelings of many victims and their families , of first responders and many @entity0 , who are not bigots but still feel the pain of 9/11 , would go a long way to achieving that reconciliation , " @entity52 said			0
@entity52 told @entity2 in his letter that he 's holding onto his award and check " in hope that you will come to see that @entity7 acted appropriately and you will want to reclaim them			1
" the @entity7 this week said it wo n't fight the building of the center after @entity0 's @entity140 eliminated a hurdle to the construction of the @entity12 center two blocks north of the site of the attacks on the @entity147			1
the commission denied landmark status for the building already at the site , moving the center one step closer to reality			0
the existing building is owned by the @entity156 , a @entity110 outreach group , and already serves as a site where prayer services are held			0
" we raised an issue ... but once the community board ruled , we move on , " @entity52 told @entity1 on wednesday			0
the @entity156 wants to demolish the existing structure and build a " $ 100 million , 13 - story community center with @entity12 , interfaith and secular programming , similar to the @entity167 , " its website says , referring to the cultural institution on the upper east side of @entity170			1
the project calls for a mosque , a performing arts center , gym , swimming pool and other public spaces			0
on wednesday , @entity52 , a @entity177 survivor , compared the ground zero controversy to the battle over building a convent near the @entity182 concentration camp at @entity183			0
" we 're not challenging rights			0
we 're asking , is this the right thing to do ? " he said wednesday			0
@entity1 's @entity186 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 returns an @entity7 award over @entity12 center stance
@entity7 says it 's " *shocked* and saddened " by the move
