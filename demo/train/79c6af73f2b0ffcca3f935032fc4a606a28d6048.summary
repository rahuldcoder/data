-- are younger people more likely to embrace their sexual identity ? that 's the implication of findings from a recent large @entity6 survey			1
the survey , which asked 120,000 @entity9 adults whether they identified as lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender , found that 6.4 % of people aged 18 to 29 said they were @entity14 : about three times more than people over age 65			1
but do results like these indicate that younger adults are more likely to be @entity14 , or are they simply more likely to acknowledge it ? it 's probably the latter , say my colleagues			1
" these numbers might reflect a generational change in social acceptance for @entity14 identities , " said psychotherapist @entity24 , director of the @entity25 at the @entity27 - based @entity26			1
" today 's youth and young adults , at least in some communities , are gradually more comfortable being open about their sexual and gender identities			1
" another potential reason for the increase in self - identified @entity14 youth is the influence of a new generation of parents who embody a positive attitude and would n't have it any other way			1
" today 's millennial parents are more than just accepting of their children 's sexual identity			2
they 're comfortable and embracing of it , too , " said @entity49 , psychologist and author of the book " @entity52			2
" " they want to actively support and engage their children through communication about all aspects of their lives			2
" hate your body ? 4 ways to get your sex life back research , including this survey , also suggests that young women may be more likely than men to identify as bisexual			1
" the pattern across surveys is that men are more likely to identify as gay , whereas women are more likely to identify as bisexual , " explained social psychologist @entity70			1
" we do n't know exactly why this is , but many psychologists believe it results from women 's sexuality being somewhat more ' flexible ' or ' fluid ' and men 's sexuality being somewhat more ' fixed			2
' " many other young people are eschewing traditional descriptors for sexuality and gender completely			1
" there 's been a lot of work done on how @entity14 youth is more and more frequently rejecting labels altogether , blurring the lines between sexual orientation and gender , creating new labels and identifying as gender - queer , gender - fluid or pansexual , to name a few , " said sex therapist @entity88			1
" the very term ' @entity14 ' is too confining now , which is why i prefer the term @entity14 , or @entity102			1
" that term could also include the 1 % of people who identify as asexual , which means they are n't sexually attracted to anyone			1
" while we 're creating space for a variety of sexual identities , we also need to create space for non-sexual identities , " said college sex educator @entity105			2
are you ' normal ' in bed ? indeed , many of the experts i spoke to expressed frustration that @entity6 and other surveys limit the options from which a respondent can choose			2
" the terms lesbian , gay and bisexual just do n't capture all sexual minority identities , " @entity70 said			2
" these studies are missing a tremendous opportunity by not including an ' other ' category			0
it 's a shame , because the ' other ' category is the wave of the future			0
" separate from sexual identity is gender identity			0
while not addressed in the @entity6 survey , experts say , this distinction is increasingly important , particularly for today 's youth			1
" gender nonconforming expression and identity are different from sexual orientation , " @entity24 explained			0
" sexual orientation is about who you are attracted to and who you fall in love with			0
gender expression and identity refer to the gender you feel comfortable expressing and identifying with , which might or might not be aligned with the biological sex you were assigned at birth			0
" as transgender and gender - nonconforming children and teens become more visible , both in communities and in the media , parents are less likely to dismiss them			0
" only a decade ago , a parent would have probably answered ' stop saying silly things ' to a 6 - year - old son who insisted on being a girl , " @entity24 added			0
" today , the same parent will stop and think about the transgender children they 've seen on tv or in magazines and may more readily inquire with professionals and other parents			0
" more than just stop and think , they 'll also hopefully want to talk			0
says @entity49 , who specializes in breaking through to teens , " open communication is a primary value for today 's parents , much more so than setting limits and rules , and the spirit of open communication trumps the content of any conversation			0
" what to do after an affair while it 's important not to confuse gender and sexual identity , parents can take a similar approach in discussing them with their kids			0
" of course , you should reassure the child of your love , but you 'll also want to find ways to expose your child to others like him or her so the child does n't feel different or alone , " @entity88 suggested			0
" allow yourself to experience mixed or negative feelings if you have them , and consider joining a support group			0
you 've also got to be prepared to be your child 's advocate with schools , neighbors and community activities			0
" i find the survey results very encouraging , as they indicate not just a shift of differences in human sexuality toward the mainstream but also suggest that the future is promising for people who do n't fit into " the norm			1
" " we 're evolving , culturally , beyond the need to impose rules on who 's allowed to do what with their genitals and their hearts , " @entity105 said			0
" this new generation of young people understands that love is love , that people are people and that the freedom to experience joy and mutually consensual pleasure is a birthright			1

a survey shows youths are more likely to identify as @entity14
the numbers may reflect a generational change in social acceptance , experts say
some young people are *bypassing* traditional descriptors of sexuality
