-- within the last month , our country has witnessed two senseless , high - profile acts of criminal violence that would have been labeled terrorism if brown - skinned @entity7 men with foreign - sounding names had committed them			1
because two white men committed these acts of violence , however , our political and media chattering class never used the word " terrorism " in its discussions			1
most recently , @entity17 , a 36 - year - old man from @entity18 , walked up to two security guards outside the @entity21 metro station in suburban @entity22 and started shooting			2
he was then shot and killed			0
according to the @entity24 , @entity23 appeared " to have been a right - wing extremist with virulent anti-government feelings " and also battled mental illness before his shooting rampage			0
a few weeks ago , on february 18 , another white anti-government extremist named @entity31 flew his small airplane into an @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , killing two people and injuring 13 others			1
according to media reports , @entity38 had left behind a disjointed suicide letter in which he expressed his hatred of our @entity43 government and outlined grievances with the @entity46 , chillingly stating that " violence not only is the answer ; it is the only answer			1
" both the @entity50 and @entity46 attacks come at a time of " explosive growth in [ domestic ] extremist - group activism across the @entity43 , " according to the @entity54			0
a recently released law center report showed so - called patriot groups -- steeped in anti-government conspiracy theories -- grew from 149 in 2008 to 512 in 2009 -- a 244 percent increase that the @entity54 report judged to be an " astonishing " rise in the one - year period since president @entity62 took the oath of office			0
the number of these groups that are domestic extremist paramilitary militias grew from 42 in 2008 to 127 in 2009 , the report said			0
even so , for any reasonable observer who is still skeptical about labeling the recent @entity21 area shooting and @entity46 attack terrorism , keep one thing in mind : let us imagine that these @entity21 and @entity46 attacks had been committed by an olive - skinned @entity74 @entity7 man named @entity75			1
our national media and political commentators would have wasted little time in calling both of these acts terrorism , and some might have also called for the closings of other @entity46 and federal government office buildings around the country as a necessary counter-terrorism safety precaution			2
instead , shortly after the @entity46 plane attack , some prominent media commentators immediately asked why people -- especially conservatives on the right -- were not calling the @entity46 attacker a terrorist			2
" if this had been done by a brownish - looking @entity7 guy whose suicide note paralleled @entity101 political themes , " wrote media commentator @entity90 , then right - wingers would " demand that anyone who refused to label the attack ' terrorism ' be put up on treason charges			2
" in a recent piece , @entity102 , of the @entity103 , wrote : " in common usage , a ' terrorist ' is someone who attacks in the name of a political cause and aims to spread terror -- to foster fear that such attacks will be repeated until grievances are addressed			0
" following suit , the @entity46 attacker 's suicide manifesto before his aerial kamikaze attack reads in part : " i know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after ... i can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be whitewashed and ignored " -- at which point , @entity121 willing , -- " the @entity43 zombies wake up and revolt			0
" if this same above - mentioned suicide letter had been instead written by an @entity74 @entity7 man named @entity75 right before crashing his airplane into an @entity46 building , most of the right - wing blogosphere would instantaneously erupt with screaming headlines of another act of @entity7 terrorism			1
because @entity134 , the @entity134 ; @entity136 bomber @entity135 ; @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity142 bomber @entity141 ; the @entity21 shooter and @entity46 attacker were all white men motivated by their respective ideologies , surprisingly , the term " terrorism " has never seemed to stick to any of them			1
to prove my point even further , the recently indicted @entity43 woman @entity148 , who called herself " @entity148 , " can rightfully be termed a wan na - be terrorist			0
but why does this not apply to other white extremists ? if our nation is truly conducting a '' war on terror '' and not a " war on @entity159 , " it is our duty as @entity43 of all colors , political persuasions and nationalities to condemn and distance ourselves from all acts of terrorism , regardless of the race or religion of those who commit violent acts in the name of extreme ideology			1
simply put , terrorism is terrorism , whether it is committed by a white , black or brown person anywhere in the world			1
if we as a nation fail to adequately condemn all acts of terrorism equally , the only clear message that we will be sending to the rest of the world is that the word " terrorist " applies only to those with olive skin and foreign - sounding last names			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			0

@entity186 : imagine if recent violent acts had been committed by @entity7 men
white man @entity31 flew plane into @entity46 building ; another shot @entity21 guards , he writes
@entity186 : outcry would ensue if @entity7 left note calling violence " the only answer , " as @entity38 did
terrorism is terrorism , whether it is committed by a white , black or brown person , he says
