" every single person in the family asked me how could this happen in a place like @entity1 in the 21st century , because it was just so simple , " he said			2
" when they knew the baby was not going to survive , why not think about the bigger life which was the mother , my wife @entity7 ? and they did n't			0
" all he wants , he said , is the truth .			0
