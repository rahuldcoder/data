-- we have all succumbed to city noise : a 5 a.m. call to prayer courtesy of a mosque after a lengthy flight , a late - night @entity7 bar crowd living it up in the wee hours , a raucous @entity11 scene in @entity12 during an important business trip			2
whatever the scenario , even the loftiest skyscraper accommodations ca n't always escape the din			0
thankfully , the age of ultra-quiet hotels -- tranquil urban cocoons that are ideal for guests in search of an escape or simply a space to rest and concentrate -- is upon us			2
the party hotels of the 1990s gave rise to the sleep - friendly accommodations of the 2000s , which prioritized high - end amenities for comfort			2
money - saving hotel tips but there is a more scientific approach that involves innovations you do n't necessarily see , like triple - paned windows , extra-thick walls and cork floor layers			1
the true measure of a hotel room 's soundproofing is evaluated by how well it deflects its cacophonous surroundings			0
yet few major booking sites offer visitors the opportunity to single out quiet hotels in notoriously noisy cities like @entity48 and @entity49 , relying instead on user - generated feedback			1
this is where brand recognition comes in			0
soundproofing styles have become proprietary secrets among hoteliers			1
lavish hotel breakfasts start the day out right all @entity59 hotels must meet the approval of an acoustics consultant			1
some properties rely on white - noise removal systems , like the @entity65 machines found in rooms at several @entity68 properties , including the @entity69 in @entity71 's @entity70			0
others , such as the @entity73 in @entity7 , outsource soundproofing to companies like @entity76 , which has installed @entity78 sound - masking devices in rooms			1
" in the @entity83 , guest - room noise has repeatedly topped the list of complaints , " says @entity80 , @entity81 vice president			0
" but noise complaints are rarely resolved to the guest 's satisfaction , and new approaches are definitely needed that tackle the problem from a different angle			0
" technology aside , one of those angles can be as simple as choosing a quiet neighborhood , like those where several of our top choices reside			1
consider it the ultimate do - not - disturb sign			1
departures : memorable hotel arrivals @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 @entity105 is home to hundreds of colonial churches , many with bell towers that clang and echo across the bowl - shaped valley in which the city sits			0
finding a soundless refuge for a mid-afternoon nap or business briefing can be tricky , but the double - and triple - glazed windows in the 31 rooms at @entity104 , a converted 1920s mansion that opened in 2012 in the city 's @entity118 , make it easier			1
@entity121 and the garden - view @entity122 are the quietest , but thick @entity125 marble and dense leather also help absorb noise in the plaza - facing accommodations			0
the @entity129 this @entity49 landmark hotel , which closed for six years during an extensive renovation before reopening in october 2012 , resides in the @entity132 , which was designed by @entity134 - period architect @entity133			0
it sits near the @entity137 bullet - train lines of @entity132 , but not a sound is heard from the plush goose - down - swaddled beds in each room			2
two layers of double - paned windows and thick blackout curtains keep out the @entity145 street noise , while steel - framed concrete walls , exterior brick - wall claddings and rubber seismic - isolation units allow guests to put @entity49 on mute as they listen to the clink of ice cubes in @entity153 crystal glasses filled with hibiki @entity155 whiskey			1
the @entity156 , @entity157 draft - free windows and soundproofed walls constructed with reinforced concrete and terracotta tiles were part of what made this property such a bastion of tranquility when it first opened in 1931			1
several renovations later , guest rooms feature solid mahogany doors , dense triple curtains and thick luxurious fabrics , all of which absorb sound			2
triple - glazed windows in bedrooms and suites facing busy @entity178 block any additional noises			1
departures : @entity182 's top walking cities @entity183 , @entity184 @entity186 's buzzy , crane - lined capital city sees new skyscraping hotels climb high nearly every month			2
but situated in a lush walled garden in the suburbs of @entity184 , the @entity183 bucks the city 's sky - rise tendencies			0
its 9,000 - square - foot @entity193 ( which sleeps eight guests ) is inspired by a @entity197 emperor 's bathhouse and is flanked with nearly inch - thick glass windows			2
it is also home to an open fireplace and a large , granite spoon - shaped bath , which is filled with green tea at night			0
@entity205 , @entity206 this elegant @entity206 newcomer is a favorite of visiting noise - sensitive musicians because of its intensely soundproofed rooms , each -- whether facing the interior gardens of the former @entity215 consulate or the bustling @entity216 -- featuring thick curtains and triple - glazed windows			1
the property takes things a step further by adding discreet bed - and - bath - side buttons , which dim the lights and activate the do - not - disturb function on the phone and doorbell , and a signature valet box that allows housekeeping to quietly pick up and deliver shoes , laundry and dry cleaning without entering			1
departures : 10 outdoor dining destinations @entity232 , @entity233 location , as we know , can make all the difference			0
and while many luxury hotels in @entity233 are adjacent to the sirens and traffic of the @entity242 , this @entity238 newcomer is nestled on the especially quiet @entity243 in the @entity244			2
it features triple - glazed windows , weighty 175 - pound doors , wood floors topped with thick carpets , dense velvet blinds and wood ceilings with micro holes that absorb noise			1
the @entity255 's @entity155 tubs made of marble and @entity258 myrtle wood are an excellent way to capitalize on the silence			0
departures : top @entity263 hotel suites @entity264 , @entity7 @entity264 , @entity268 hotelier @entity266 's first foray into @entity7 , ditched its usual @entity270 hotel atmosphere for a relaxing " urban ryokan " vibe on a quiet side street in @entity274 's extreme west end			0
some of the property 's 56 rooms feature double - glazed windows , deep soaking tubs , hanging fireplaces and low platform beds placed inside large wooden cubbies that create a thick sound shield			1
the rooftop pool doubles as a hot tub in the winter			0
