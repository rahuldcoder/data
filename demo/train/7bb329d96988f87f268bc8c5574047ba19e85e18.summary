we pay a lot of attention to revolutions when they emerge suddenly and violently , but when a transformation arrives gradually and peacefully it 's easy to miss. let 's stop for a moment and take a look at a slow - motion development changing the world as we know it : the @entity12 is giving up its addiction to foreign oil			1
for decades , we bemoaned the awful toll this addiction has taken			2
the need for oil and natural gas -- much of it from @entity20 dictatorships -- shaped the foundation of global geopolitics			1
it created morally questionable alliances and repeatedly placed @entity25 in a position to choose between its fundamental values and its economic interests			0
now all that could change			0
when president @entity31 started his first term , the country faced stiff economic headwinds			0
now , as he prepares to start his second term , the country enjoys a rare and unexpected tailwind , propelling it in one of the most important areas , with a host of positive implications			0
clearly , the booming @entity12 oil and gas businesses are not problem - free , but the benefits -- economic , geopolitical and environmental -- of this impending energy independence far outweigh the drawbacks			1
the days when @entity20 oil - producing dictatorships and their friends at @entity53 could so easily wave their power over a trembling , oil - thirsty @entity49 are on their way to becoming a relic of the past			1
@entity12 still needs imported oil			1
but growing production and shrinking consumption have created a most promising trend			0
according to the @entity63 , the @entity12 will become the world 's leading oil producer in just a few years			1
the @entity12 could produce more oil than @entity68 as early as 2017 and become a net oil exporter by 2030			1
and if you count other petroleum products , the future is already here			0
in 2011 , the @entity12 exported more petroleum products -- including gasoline , diesel and other fuels -- than it imported			2
that had not happened in more than half a century			0
@entity78 : a tax we could learn to love the first major sign of impact is visible in @entity84			0
the loosening of oil markets has strengthened the world 's hand against oil - rich @entity84			1
one main reason the international community has been able to impose strong sanctions on @entity93 , aimed at persuading the regime to stop its illegal nuclear enrichment program , is that the global economy can do without @entity84 oil			2
@entity84 's production has fallen 40 % , a drop that not long ago would have created unacceptable economic hardships for the rest of the planet			2
the trend is even more dramatic when you include natural gas , a product that is revolutionizing energy markets			0
the @entity12 is about to become the second - largest exporter of natural gas behind @entity110			2
gigantic oil and gas finds in the @entity12 and elsewhere are transforming the landscape , in some cases quite literally			1
other than rising oil prices , the reason for this shift is that new and controversial technologies such as fracking and horizontal drilling have multiplied the amount of viable deposits in unexpected places			0
the techniques take an environmental toll , but there are upsides			0
fracking , as we keep learning , is creating very troubling problems , which deserve scrutiny			0
but it is helping to replace coal , the dirtiest form of energy production , with much cleaner natural gas			0
another dark lining in this silver cloud is that cheaper oil and gas will reduce incentives to produce green energies			2
rather than abandoning the new sources of energy , efforts should focus on finding ways to reduce the negative impact of fracking and on continuing the push for alternative energy			0
fracking protesters say drilling jobs not worth environmental risks the @entity31 administration now faces a balancing act as it starts its new term			0
energy policy , the quest for full energy independence , must be weighed against the growing threat of climate change			1
a decision on the controversial @entity164 pipeline is imminent and political pressure against fracking will grow			0
the president should support strong climate legislation , without reversing the powerful gains of surging @entity12 oil and gas production , with all its transformational benefits			1
the two goals are not mutually exclusive			0
@entity173 , @entity12 was the @entity68 of whale oil , the fuel of its day			1
whale oil was displaced by hydrocarbon production , which the @entity12 also dominated			1
that started changing with enormous geopolitical consequences after easy , high quality oil was found in the @entity180 and other parts of the @entity20			1
the @entity12 built alliances with autocratic regimes as part of a commitment to satisfy its needs and preserve the free flow of oil , which became the life - blood of the global economy			1
for oil - rich countries , this brought enormous fortunes , but it also brought something known as the " resource curse			0
" with wealth concentrated in the hands of autocrats , corruption mushroomed , and other sectors of the economy withered			0
a trend away from the concentration of oil production in such an unstable , undemocratic part of the world bodes well			1
it bodes well for human rights , and it also bodes well , ironically , for the economies of oil - rich countries , which may at long last find an incentive to diversify into other industries			0
it certainly bodes well for the @entity12 economy , which is already creating tens of thousands of jobs in industries related to the new boom			2
@entity217 : @entity219 's film overlooks fracking 's boon in what sounds like something from another era , the @entity222 forecast declining gasoline prices for the next few years			2
that 's the first bit of good news for @entity12 consumers			1
the really good news is the knowledge that soon , every time you fill up your tank you will not be sending a piece of your paycheck to the @entity20			2
that , among other things , is excellent news for @entity12 's balance of trade and for the soundness of the @entity12 economy , which sadly now struggles with a politically dysfunctional @entity25			1
no matter how much oil the @entity12 and its friends in the @entity246 produce , the @entity20 remains a principal global petroleum producer for the foreseeable future			1
the @entity12 still needs to ensure the free flow of oil , because a stop in production will cause prices to spike on global markets , affecting the entire planet			1
but @entity12 and its friends are becoming much less vulnerable to oil shocks			2
and supplies from other parts of the world are becoming more plentiful			0
the emerging changes in the world 's energy markets , if they continue to develop , are nothing short of revolutionary			1
as @entity31 prepares for a new term in office , they are gradually rerouting us from a destiny that we had thought was inescapable and rather dismal to one that , while far from assured , looks much more promising .			0

@entity273 : the @entity12 will become the world 's leading oil producer in a few years
@entity277 : it is truly transformational that the @entity12 is giving up its addiction to foreign oil
despite energy independence , we need to keep looking into green energy , she says
@entity277 : it 's beneficial for the @entity12 to not rely on unstable , undemocratic @entity20 for oil
