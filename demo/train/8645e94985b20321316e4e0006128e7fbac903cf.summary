@entity1 @entity0 is well aware that if he runs for president in 2016 -- a decision he says he will announce by march -- he will face a monumental challenge			1
he is n't a registered @entity6 , but would be vying for the party 's presidential nomination			2
he does n't have much name recognition , but would be likely going up against the uber - recognizable @entity10			0
and as of late , it does n't even seem like he has the support of his base			0
liberal group @entity14 ready to kick - off $ 1 million campaign in the last few months , the liberal activists inside the @entity17 have been organizing around the possibility of a long - shot presidential run by sen. @entity20 of @entity21 , not @entity0 ' seemingly more likely run			1
liberal groups have been pining for a @entity25 run for months and on tuesday , a coalition of groups announced they would kick off their efforts in @entity29 with a rally and plans to open local offices			1
this comes despite the fact @entity25 bluntly said " no " when asked if she was running in 2016			2
@entity0 ' hope , although he is somewhat loathe to admit it , is that he will someday get that same support			1
" obviously one would hope one would have as much support as possible from all walks of life , " he said on tuesday when asked why he thinks those groups are n't rallying around him			0
" i am a great fan of @entity20 and as for what people do and why they do n't do it , i am not going to speculate			1
" @entity45 , the @entity46 of @entity47 , said that although @entity14 members have " enormous respect for @entity0 , " it is @entity25 who is " on fire			1
" with a new knee , @entity53 's still considering 2016 plans " sen. @entity25 is perfectly in tune with this moment in history and her message , which has been a consistent , singularly focused message ... resonates with an almost electric energy , " @entity45 said			2
a source at @entity14 , however , was more blunt in their assessment of why @entity25 over @entity0			1
" you can see when the needle breaks the gauge , " the source said			0
" it happens with @entity25			0
it happens with @entity25 in a way that it does n't happen with anyone else right now			0
" this is a problem for @entity0 : the people he could once rely on -- liberal organizers -- have found someone else to support			1
" if we ca n't do that , " @entity0 said on invigorating the grassroots to get around him , " then i am not going to [ run ]			1
" campaign should focus on issues , not personality @entity0 is the most serious progressive candidate actively entertaining a run at the presidency in 2016			1
he has taken a number of trips to @entity87 and @entity29 , two presidential mainstays , and regularly speaks at liberal conferences across the country			1
on tuesday , in an editorial board meeting with @entity2 , he reiterated that he was strongly considering a run as either a @entity6 or a independent			0
but that is about all he was interested in talking about regarding 2016			0
torture report splits 2016 democrats " ten minutes into this discussion and no one has asked me about any of the major issues facing this country , " @entity0 said after a group of @entity2 producers and reporters peppered him with questions about the race , @entity10 and his prospects for running			1
" [ i have ] no intention of taking on @entity10 , that is not the issue , that is the wrong question , " he said			0
" i am not taking on @entity10			0
i am taking on the issues			2
" to @entity0 , elections should be more simplified			1
candidates outline where they stand on complex issues , devoid of personality politics and poll questions about who @entity117 would rather have a beer with			0
a number of times in the hour , @entity0 -- a senator who has come to be known as much for his fly - away hair as his passionate speeches in the @entity125 -- bluntly lamented the way political journalism in the @entity117 focuses on personality as it does			1
" i think this is not about personality , " @entity0 said , raising his @entity129 - by - way - of - @entity131 voice			2
" i am not a singer , i am not a dancer , i am not an entertainer			0
" these 2016 long - shots think they can win ? @entity0 would rather have voters know his policies , than his favorite vacation destination or his childhood icons			2
in @entity144 's view , it was personality -- not policy -- that elected former president @entity148 , someone the independent says was a " very nice guy ... but the worst president this country has had			2
" " i think the media , and i have to throw this back at you guys , makes it too easy to cover my grandchildren , " he said			0
" or @entity157 's dog riding on the top of his car			0
very interesting , but it is not important			0

@entity0 needs the liberal grassroots to rally around a prospective presidential *bid*
@entity166 activists have rallied around the idea of sen. @entity20 running for president
@entity0 says campaigns -- and media -- should focus on issues , not personalities
