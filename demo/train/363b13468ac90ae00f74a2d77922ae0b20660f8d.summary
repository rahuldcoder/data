-- imagine you 're the kind of person who worries about a future when robots become smart enough to threaten the very existence of the human race			0
for years , you 've been dismissed as a crackpot , consigned to the same category of people who see @entity10 lurking in their waffles			0
in 2014 , you found yourself in good company			2
this year , arguably the world 's greatest living scientific mind , @entity15 , and its leading techno - industrialist , @entity17 , voiced their fears about the potentially lethal rise of artificial intelligence			1
they were joined by philosophers , physicists and computer scientists , all of whom spoke out about the serious risks posed by the development of greater - than - human machine intelligence			2
in a widely cited op - ed co-written with @entity32 physicist @entity31 , @entity34 laureate @entity33 and computer scientist @entity35 , @entity15 sounded the @entity37 alarm			1
" one can imagine ( @entity37 ) outsmarting financial markets , out - inventing human researchers , out - manipulating human leaders , and developing weapons we can not even understand			1
whereas the short - term impact of @entity37 depends on who controls it , the long - term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all			1
" @entity17 was reportedly more emphatic , expanding on his tweeted warnings by calling @entity37 humanity 's biggest " existential risk " and likening it to " summoning the demon			1
" the debate over @entity37 was given a big boost this year by the publication of philosopher @entity56 's " @entity55 : paths , dangers , strategies , " which makes a close study of just why and how @entity37 may be so catastrophically dangerous ( 2013 's " @entity62 " by documentarian @entity63 makes a similar case )			1
@entity56 : when machines outsmart humans @entity56 is the director of the @entity66 at @entity67 , one of several new institutions devoted to studying existential threats to the human race , of which @entity37 figures centrally			1
in may , the @entity32 christened its own future of @entity73			0
in the academic community at least , @entity37 anxiety is booming			1
they 're right to be worried			0
the first and most immediate issue is the potential for @entity37 to put large numbers of humans out of work			1
a study by @entity83 and @entity84 of @entity67 's @entity85 put the matter starkly			0
in their analysis of over 700 jobs , almost half could be done by a computer in the future			0
this wave of computerization could destroy not simply low - wage , low - skill jobs ( though those are in acute danger ) but some white - collar and service sector jobs previously thought to be immune as well			0
technology is marching on both our manual and mental labor			0
as serious a threat as widespread job loss is , we 've seen this movie before			0
during past technological upheavals , humans have cleverly created jobs and industries from the ashes of obsolete ones			0
we may be able to keep our collective heads above water even if @entity37 encroaches on more creative and intellectual industries ( heck , we may even start working less )			1
what we should be more concerned about is humanity losing its perch as the @entity119 's foremost intelligence			2
for those anxious about @entity37 , current efforts to develop self - correcting algorithms ( " machine learning " ) , coupled with the relentless growth in computer power and the increasing ubiquity of sensors collecting all manner of intelligence and information around the world , will push @entity37 to human and ultimately superhuman intelligence			1
it 's an event that 's been dubbed " the intelligence explosion , " a term invoked in 1965 by computer scientist @entity137 in a paper outlining the development path for artificial intelligence			2
what makes an intelligence explosion so worrisome is that intelligence is not a tool or a technology			1
we may think of @entity37 as something that we use , like a hammer or corkscrew , but that 's fundamentally the wrong way to think about it			1
sufficiently advanced intelligence , like ours , is a creative force			1
the more powerful it is , the more it can reshape the world around it			1
artificial intelligence does not need to be malevolent to be catastrophically dangerous to humanity			2
when computer scientists talk about the possible threat to humanity from superintelligent @entity37 , they do n't mean the terminator or @entity163			1
instead , it 's typically a more prosaic end : humanity wiped out because an @entity37 tasked with a simple goal ( say , creating paper clips , an example that is often used ) requisitions all the energy and raw materials on @entity119 to relentlessly churn out paper clips , outsmarting and out - maneuvering all human attempts to stop it			2
in @entity176 's telling , there are always humans left to fight back , but such an outcome is implausible if humanity is faced with a truly superior intelligence			0
it would be like mice attempting to outwit a human ( we 're the mice )			0
in that event , @entity37 researchers like @entity185 see a less inspiring finale : " all the people are dead			2
" needless to say , not everyone shares this bleak forecast			0
in the @entity37 optimist camp , futurist and @entity195 director of engineering @entity196 also sees intelligent machines precipitating human extinction , of a sort , only in @entity196 's telling , humanity is not exterminated but subsumed into a superintelligent machine			2
@entity196 's human - machine symbiosis is not a techno - catastrophe but the ultimate liberation from humanity 's biological frailties			0
others are skeptical that @entity37 will ever reach human levels of intelligence and cognition , let alone surpass it			1
some , like @entity215 's @entity214 , are on the fence			0
" i do n't know of any proof that we should be worried , " @entity214 told me this year , " but nor of any proof that we should not be worried			0
" @entity137 @entity137 famously described the development of an ultraintelligent machine as the " last invention that man need ever make , " for after that , humanity would cede innovation and technological development to its smarter progeny			0
even if it 's not a straight line from @entity234 to extinction , we humans should probably be watching our machines just a bit more closely .			0

@entity239 : 2014 is the year notable concerns were raised about @entity37
sufficiently advanced intelligence is a creative force , not a tool , he says
@entity239 : more powerful it is , the more it can reshape the world around it
