modern contraceptives have radically changed women 's lives , but they are not risk free			2
a new study out of the journal of @entity5 finds the levonorgestrel - releasing intrauterine system ( @entity7 ) or progesterone - releasing @entity8 , may be associated with a higher than expected incidence of breast cancer			1
this form of @entity8 was originally developed as a contraceptive , but later was also used as a treatment for women who suffer from heavy periods ( menorrhagia ) as well as endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain			1
@entity19 is a synthetic progesterone , which is a hormone that 's naturally produced in a woman 's body			2
the hormone causes changes to the uterine lining and mucus in the cervix which makes it harder for sperm to reach the uterus , therefore making it more difficult to conceive			0
because it strengthens the uterine lining , it helps cut down on heavy bleeding			0
@entity19 is also the hormone used in the @entity19 contraceptive , better known as the morning after pill			0
in this study , @entity39 researchers from the @entity40 at the @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity39 , wanted to examine the association between premenopausal use of the @entity7 and cancer rates , especially when it came to endometrial adenocarcinoma ( cancer of the uterine wall )			2
the study followed more than 93,000 @entity39 women between the ages of 30 and 49			1
all of the subjects were using the hormone - releasing @entity8 to treat their heavy periods from 1994 to 2007			1
at that time , up to 60 % of all @entity55 sold in @entity39 were used for heavy periods and not for contraception			1
investigators found that over time , the device did not significantly raise the risk of uterine cancer or ovarian , pancreatic and lung cancers			2
but researchers did see a spike in the number of breast cancer cases , especially in women between the ages of 45 - 49 , compared to women in the general population who were not using this particular @entity8			1
" the number of diagnosed new breast cancer cases among @entity39 women who used @entity7 for menorrhagia was 19 % higher than in @entity39 general population , " said dr. @entity73 , the lead author of the study			1
however , the research does not say that this type of @entity8 causes breast cancer			1
@entity73 also adds " one limitation of our study was that women suffering from heavy menstruation may in fact represent a selected group of women who may have other risk factors for cancer , such as factors related to lifestyle , genetic factors , just to name a few			1
" according to @entity73 , this study is the first linking premenopausal @entity99 - @entity98 use and breast cancer			1
two earlier studies did not reveal an increased cancer risk , according to the study			1
for physicians , this research is a new piece of information they can pass on to those patients			0
" it 's a great reminder that we need to weigh the benefits of some of these methods against the risks , " said dr. @entity109 , director of @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112			0
" we need to educate our patients , because many of these therapies may work , but some could have serious side effects			0
women need to be told			0
then it 's up to the patient , along with a doctor 's guidance , to make the decision			0
" the study authors agree			0
" lng - ius use seemed to protect against endometrial cancer , which is a common cancer type steadily increasing in the population , " said @entity73			2
" we are still convinced @entity7 is the best treatment modality for heavy menstrual bleeding , a common health problem affecting the quality of life of a large proportion of female population overall			0
we certainly hesitate to recommend any change of the clinical menorrhagia management guidelines			0
" @entity73 also stressed , " however , health benefits and health risks should be carefully taken into account while counseling menorrhagia patients , in relation to any hormonal or surgical therapy			0

study of @entity39 women using progesterone - releasing @entity8 found higher instance of breast cancer
the women were using the @entity8 to help with their heavy periods
two earlier studies did not show such a risk
