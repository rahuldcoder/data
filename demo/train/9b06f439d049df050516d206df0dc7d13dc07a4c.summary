-- travel is meant to be a rich experience , a means of engaging with culture , cuisine and pleasure			2
in the last decade , cities around the world have helped this along by building exceptionally designed , clean , well - functioning airports			1
along with them have come equally stunning airport lounges , and the super-luxe first - class areas in international hubs around the world are a testament to a new age of luxury			1
instead of feeling like they 're on the wrong side of a quarantine -- and serving decidedly lack - luster food ( everyone 's had a run - in with those dreaded airport " panini " ) -- these lounges are oases offering first - rate amenities , privacy and calm			1
it 's all so good , in fact , you might even want to get to the airport early			2
departures : the top villas in @entity36 airports are gateways to the world , and these 10 airport lounges cater to global travelers who want the journey to be as memorable as the destination			1
amazing first - class air cabins @entity46 @entity45 , @entity47 , @entity48 the feeling that half of @entity51 has joined you at your gate at @entity45 is over			1
this march , @entity46 premiered its new clubhouse with an @entity55 - meets - uptown mod cocktail lounge at its heart , complete with a red leather sofa and purple lighting			1
but it 's the @entity61 , featuring dr. @entity63 products and treatments , that really makes the @entity45 a standout layover option			1
14 outstanding airport amenities in the end , just like the $ 17 million flagship at @entity70 , this lounge offers everything you need ( massages , facials , foot treatments ) , everything you did n't know you needed ( a @entity79 and @entity80 salon ) and several things that you do n't really need at all but are certainly nice to have ( anyone for a game of pool ? )			1
beyond @entity86 checkpoint in @entity87 , above boarding gates @entity88 and @entity90 ; virgin - atlantic.com			1
departures : let 's go glamping ! @entity94 , @entity70 the decidedly unfashionable herringbone print , velvets and crystal chandeliers of the @entity94 at @entity70 recall a well - to - do @entity94 gentleman 's study in all its relaxed , un-modern glory			1
quite simply , this is a retreat -- albeit one with full waiter service , complimentary wines and @entity106 and private , hotel - style cabanas with day beds and en - suite bathrooms			1
if retreating is n't your habit , book a theater ticket with the concierge , then head to the terrace for a drink from the fabulous @entity115 and views of the runway			0
@entity120 's @entity119 , @entity121 to enter @entity120 's first - class lounge is a dangerous game of choose - your - own - indulgence			1
leave the kids at the door			0
staff nannies keep little ones busy in the kids ' retreat among colorful beanbags and toys ; parents head to the @entity134 for a complimentary treatment			1
departures : spectacular hotel rooftop pools then the real decision - making begins			1
will it be the @entity106 bar for the finest wines and bubbly or the cigar lounge ? @entity143 dining in a fine - dining atmosphere or dinner at the chef 's table ? just do n't forget the kids			1
@entity150 , @entity151 from felt walls that swallow outside noise to @entity161 tableware to the wireless , mobile phone - charging system @entity152 ( wireless ! ) , the simplicity and thoughtfulness of the @entity150 make it exceptional			1
a buffet is always on , and in addition to the views , the elegant @entity166 and @entity167 furniture designs provide their own easy pleasure			0
for those on the way to @entity174 , the midnight buffet is particularly elaborate			0
travelers in need of a spa will need to have patience -- the @entity179 ( complete with traditional @entity166 saunas ) will reopen this winter , but in the meantime there are showers at the lounge			1
@entity185 between @entity186 and 37 ; finnair.com			0
@entity187 , @entity188 @entity189 's @entity187 offers its own passport control and security checkpoints , so travelers get personal attention all the way until they walk down the gangplank to the airplane			0
( behind security in @entity199 , there is also a smaller but no less elegant first class lounge for @entity202 flights			0
) creatively done lighting radiates from behind a black glass wall and from the tops of marble partitions in the restaurant			0
everything , from the size of the tables to the marble and oak bar to the monsoon showerheads , is presented generously and thoughtfully			0
next to @entity214 ; lufthansa.com			0
departures : top hotel room service the pier , @entity218 the seasoned traveler will be forgiven for any long - standing preconceptions about eating ( or , sadly , not eating ) in airports			1
thankfully , not far from @entity223 at @entity218 , those expectations will be overturned			0
at the pier — @entity226 's glass - enclosed first - and business - class break area — you 'll find freshly made @entity229 noodles at the @entity230 and proper fine dining and modern decor at the first - class @entity234 restaurant			2
( there are also two more fully stocked café / bars			0
) in addition to the business centers , the @entity238 , the leather armchairs and the pebbled showers , a glass of @entity106 also goes a long way to ease travel stress			0
@entity186 62 - 66 , @entity246 ; cathaypacific.com			2
@entity247 , @entity248 modernity , with polished surfaces , clear glass and stainless steel , is the norm of airport luxury today , give or take a @entity256 modern knock - off table or two and a leather armchair			2
which is why we 're thrilled with the 98 - foot , 8,400 - plant vertical garden that greets passengers at the @entity247 at @entity248			2
it leaves the air in the atrium feeling cleaner and lighter			0
better yet , part of the garden is incorporated into each of the @entity269 day spa treatment rooms , so you can forget , for the moment , that you 're in transit			2
the upper floor of the lounge , designed by @entity275 and replete with recliners and sofas ( in addition to those leather armchairs ) , also includes an open kitchen restaurant serving food by @entity283 chef @entity282			2
@entity285 , @entity286 @entity286 airport knows how to do things on a massive scale better than anyone , which is why @entity285 worked with it to create this first - and business - class terminal cum mall cum hotel			1
it includes a handful of worthwhile airport elements ( duty - free , fine boutiques ) and complements them with the fundamentals of a fine lounge ( a full - service @entity302 spa , including @entity304 and sauna ; several restaurants , cafés and bars ; private meeting rooms and business centers )			1
hotel - style bedroom suites and child entertainment round out the offerings , and the result is truly over the top			1
near main @entity317 building ; qatarairways.com			0
@entity319 @entity318 , @entity320 at @entity325 , as throngs of travelers roll handcarts piled high with suitcases to overflowing check - in lines , @entity321 greet first - class passengers of @entity319 curbside , taking their bags , guiding them to an armchair in the first - class check - in lounge and checking them in personally			2
next it 's off to the first - class @entity318 , where , depending on their mood , guests can choose from meeting rooms , café / bars or 13 @entity339 - leather slumberettes			2
do n't worry -- the staff will wake you before your flight			0
terminal 2 on @entity343 ( @entity344 ) ; terminal 3 on @entity343 ; singaporeair.com			0
@entity345 , @entity346 guests of the @entity349 can sun themselves under an enormous glass dome , surrounded by bright , simple materials -- like chrome and wood -- rather than some of the richer , upholstered surfaces found in other first class lounges			0
the architecture is open , the greenery is plentiful and the staff at the welcome desk is attentive			0
expect warm and cold buffets , leather recliners facing the panoramic windows , a proper @entity365 bar and a @entity229 bridge in an atrium surrounded by palm trees			0
somehow , it all works together impeccably -- @entity370 just voted it the best airport lounge of 2012			0
