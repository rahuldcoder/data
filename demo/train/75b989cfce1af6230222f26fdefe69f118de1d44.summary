-- it 's a case that has become emblematic of the risks involved in international adoption			1
the case involves a now - 6 - year - old girl , two countries ( the @entity7 and @entity8 ) , and two families who , in addition to th girl , have been deeply affected by what a @entity8 woman describes as her daughter 's kidnapping five years ago			1
@entity16 , a 26 - year - old @entity8 mother , says she was arriving home in @entity18 in november of 2006 with her three children when a woman grabbed her then - 2 - year - old daughter and got into a waiting taxi			1
after months of posting flyers , visiting orphanages and talking to strangers , @entity16 says she found her daughter by staging a hunger strike and pressuring @entity8 authorities to show her international adoption records			1
as she was patiently reviewing about 2,000 files in 2008 , the mother 's heart sank			0
her little girl had been offered for adoption under a false name and adopted by an @entity7 family in @entity37 , @entity38			1
the mother - daughter relationship was confirmed through dna -- a dna sample is taken from every @entity8 child adopted internationally , and the sample from the girl matched @entity16			1
after a three - year legal case , a @entity8 judge issued a ruling that is expected to test the limits of international law : an @entity7 couple must return the girl they adopted to her biological mother in the country of her birth			1
when @entity16 learned about the decision in late july , she broke down in tears			2
for the first time the judge was giving her the possibility of seeing her daughter again			2
would she remember her after such a long time ? " i have fought so hard for this			0
it 's been almost five years and this surprising ruling makes me very happy , " @entity16 said			2
she also had a message for the @entity7 couple who adopted her daughter			2
" all i want to tell them is to return my girl			0
i do n't have anything against them because perhaps they took my daughter without knowing that she had been stolen from me			0
that 's why i want to ask them to return her to me because i have been suffering for five years , " @entity16 said			2
the @entity7 couple apparently had no idea that the girl they were adopting was kidnapped			2
they have n't made any public statements			0
but @entity79 , a spokesman for the adoptive parents , issued a written statement saying : " the family will continue to advocate for the safety and best interests of their legally adopted child			0
they remain committed to protecting their daughter from additional trauma as they pursue the truth of her past through appropriate legal channels			0
" eight people are behind bars in @entity8 in connection with this case , including the judge who allowed the adoption to take place			1
he is accused of taking bribes in exchange for expediting cases			0
all eight individuals have trials pending			0
@entity108 , vice president of @entity109 , a nonprofit corporation that monitors adoption practices throughout the world , called the case of the @entity8 girl " an absolute tragedy			1
" speaking to @entity0 affiliate @entity115 in @entity38 , @entity108 added that " if something like this is what it takes for there to be real reform and oversight over the international adoption process , that portion of it is a good result ; but i would never wish this on anyone			1
" @entity128 , assistant director of a @entity8 non-governmental organization known as @entity130 , says this case should send a message to authorities in charge of monitoring adoptions throughout the world			0
" more than anything , " @entity143 says , " this case is about a child 's right to live with their true family , the parents ' right to raise their own biological children which in this case was clearly violated , and the respect to the rule of law			0
" the ruling issued by the @entity8 judge says the girl must be returned to her biological parents within two months			1
advocates for the biological family in @entity8 say that because this could be considered a human trafficking case under international law , if the girl is not returned , @entity154 could be asked to assist in taking the girl back to her native country			1
@entity161 spokeswoman @entity160 said tuesday she had seen reports on the case			0
her only comment was that the situation " speaks to the complicated nature of these foreign adoption cases			0
