-- i hate the holidays			2
this is the dangerous season when more family finances go off the rails than at any time of the year			1
from the opening gun on @entity10 through the last - minute grabs on christmas eve there seems to be a national moratorium on sound spending practices			1
that said , if you 're expecting some finger - wagging lecture about not spending money on gifts this year , well , i hate to disappoint you , but that 's not where i am headed			1
gift - giving is part of our celebration ritual			2
and there 's nothing wrong with that			2
all that i care about -- and what you should care about just as much -- is that your gift - giving shows respect			2
that means crafting a gift - giving strategy that is affordable for you today			2
what you gave to someone last year , or the length of last - year 's gift - giving list should be irrelevant			1
yet we all know that there 's this internal pressure to keep up appearances or traditions , even if your financial circumstances have changed			1
so even if you did a fabulous job the first 11 months of the year scaling back your spending so you could ramp up your retirement savings , or pay down your debts , there 's a temptation to let those good habits get pushed to the back burner during this dangerous season			1
here 's how to make it through this holiday season with your financial integrity intact			1
pay cash i challenge you to not make one holiday gift purchase with a credit card			1
you ca n't have regrets in january if you limit your spending to money you actually have			1
the tab for unpaid credit card balances in the @entity64 is $ 690 billion			0
it 's one thing to run up a balance if your family is struggling to make ends meet -- and even that has obvious serious consequences -- but there is just no excuse for running up any credit card debt for gifts			0
the simplest way to keep your household on track is to put the credit cards away and use a debit card tied to a bank account			0
and do n't you dare let the bank snooker you into accepting overdraft protection			1
that 's just a temptation to allow yourself to slip and spend more than you have			1
the only one who really benefits is the bank ; the average charge for an overdraft is $ 30			0
prioritize it takes a plan to make it through this season unscathed			1
here 's my three - step strategy : set a spending limit , stick to a firm list of recipients and most important , no wavering from steps 1 and 2			2
your spending limit is pretty simple : how much extra cash do you have handy ? no dipping into savings ( unless you in fact were smart and have a holiday savings account you 've been socking money into throughout the year )			1
no touching the emergency fund			0
no gift is an emergency			0
and no robbing @entity110 : no cheating by not making your @entity113 deposit this month or skipping the kid 's @entity115 savings contribution to free up cash for presents			2
next , decide who 's on your list			0
then divvy up your cash to each person : literally write down how much you intend to spend on each person			1
if the numbers do n't add up , then you 've got a few choices : spend less on that person , spend less on someone else			1
reduce the number of people on your list			0
or get creative : offer to babysit for the kids of harried friends or family			0
that 's probably going to be worth a hell of a lot more than any monetary gift			0
have a friend who keeps talking about tackling cleaning out their garage or fixing up a spare room ? okay , your gift is three weekends over the course of the year to serve as their sub-contractor and cheerleader			2
you get the idea : before you spend a penny on gifts this season you need to have a formal plan from which you will not deviate			2
do n't get played retailers know we are suckers for anything that seems like a deal			1
so they try to play us for chumps			0
instead of offering a $ 50 sweater for $ 50 , they advertise that the sweater was $ 75 but they are going to let you steal it from them for $ 50			0
@entity164 , one - third off ! and this works like a charm thanks to our anchoring habit			0
that 's a term used by behavioral economists to describe how we get fixated on a number			0
in this case , we 're anchored to the fact that the sweater is " worth " $ 75 , so we feel like we 're getting a great deal at $ 50			0
but is it really a deal ? for starters , slow down and size up what you 're buying			0
does it seem worth it at $ 50 ? quality matters			0
and most important , do you have the $ 50 to spend ? the sales price does n't matter if you were intending to spend $ 40 on this specific gift			1
it 's still overpriced by 20 percent based on what you can truthfully afford			0
standing in your truth is the most important gift to bestow this and every holiday season			1
it 's not just about doing what is right for you			0
when we stand in our truth -- without embarrassment , without fear -- we remove layers of stress and panic			1
and that makes us happier and more present for those we love			2
that strikes me as the most generous gift any of us has to give			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			1

@entity208 says holiday shopping makes us forget our sound spending practices
she says how we spend should *reflect* our financial *situation* in the here and now , not last year
she says there are *disciplines* to maintain : pay cash , prioritize , do n't get played
@entity208 : stand in your truth about what you have to spend , and you will have less stress
