@entity0 -- the @entity3 navy suffered its worst peacetime disaster this week when an explosion and fire sank a submarine with 18 sailors on board in a @entity11 dockyard			1
divers have entered the vessel 's sunken hulk , but have so far been unable to locate those trapped inside			2
@entity16 officials , meanwhile , are trying to figure out what went wrong on the @entity18 , a submarine that had only recently returned from an extensive refitting in @entity21			1
they are also facing the challenge of patrolling @entity3 's vast coastline with an aging , and now depleted , submarine fleet			1
the sinking of the submarine is " an unprecedented setback to the national effort to strengthen undersea defense capabilities , " the @entity26 , a daily newspaper , said in an editorial thursday			1
the disaster struck at a particularly unfortunate time for @entity3 authorities , as prime minister @entity36 acknowledged in a speech thursday to mark the 66th anniversary of @entity3 's independence from @entity40			1
@entity3 unveils home - built aircraft carrier " the accident is all the more painful because the navy had recently achieved two major successes in the form of its first nuclear submarine , @entity49 , and the aircraft carrier , @entity51 , " he said			1
" eighteen brave sailors are feared to have lost their lives , " @entity36 said			1
the @entity3 navy had last week activated the reactor on the @entity49 , its first domestically built nuclear submarine			1
and on monday , it launched the @entity51 , a home - built aircraft carrier			0
in a country where the military has long relied heavily on @entity21 military hardware , @entity36 and other officials had hailed both events as big steps forward for @entity3 's technological capabilities			1
but the explosion and fire aboard the @entity18 brought the moment of national pride to an abrupt end			1
@entity16 officials have ordered an investigation into what set off the blast			0
at a news conference wednesday , @entity3 navy chief @entity76 struggled to come up with possible theories about the cause , noting that the recently refurbished submarine had received " highly satisfactory gradings " in an inspection last month			1
" we are at this point in time unable to put our finger on what could have actually gone wrong , " he said			0
the @entity18 was one of 10 @entity89 diesel - electric submarines supplied to the @entity3 navy by the @entity21 defense contractor @entity92			1
the navy also has four smaller @entity94 - built diesel electric submarines , and one nuclear - powered submarine leased from @entity21 last year			1
according to the navy , the 10 kilo - class vessels have " a displacement of 3,000 tonnes , a maximum diving depth of 300 meters , top speed of 18 knots , and are able to operate solo for 45 days with a crew of 53			0
" commissioned between 1986 and 2000 , some of them are also getting on a bit			0
the @entity18 was commissioned in 1997			2
but after its recent refit , from which it only returned in april , it " was probably the most modern submarine " in the navy 's inventory , said @entity106 , @entity3 correspondent for @entity107			1
the redesign included the installation of new missile , communication and cooling systems , as well as a new radar , @entity21 state news agency @entity113 reported			2
the upgrade also included other measures to improve the submarine 's combat quality and operational safety , the agency said			2
with the @entity18 now apparently a write off , the navy will have to make do with the 14 submarines it has left			2
that falls well short of its desired level of 24 , according to @entity106			0
and four or five of the remaining vessels are due for retirement because of their age			0
" they 're being kept alive by various means , " @entity106 said			0
" they 're in the @entity139 , as it were			0
" reinforcements , meanwhile , appear to be a long way off			0
plans to modernize the fleet have been delayed by about five or six years because of " technical problems , bureaucratic wrangling and cost overruns , " @entity106 said			2
a series of corruption scandals in recent months , including in a new submarine project , have paralyzed government decision - making about expensive investments , he said			2
the delays are holding back the @entity155 's efforts to counter @entity157 's increasing maritime strength in @entity158			0
the navy wants to play a more assertive role throughout the @entity161 , a crucial zone for world trade , and farther afield , according to @entity106			0
@entity1 's @entity164 reported from @entity0 , and @entity165 reported and wrote from @entity166			0
@entity1 's @entity167 in @entity11 contributed to this report .			0
