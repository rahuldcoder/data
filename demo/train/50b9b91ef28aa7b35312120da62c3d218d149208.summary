-- the @entity1 recently finalized a rule that for the first time requires @entity7 coal and oil - fired power plant operators to limit emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants			1
@entity1 rules in place under the @entity13 have targeted acid rain and smog - forming chemicals emitting from power plants			2
but perhaps surprising to many , those rules have never included limits on mercury , a neurotoxin known to damage developing fetuses and children			2
how this policy affects your health the benefits of this new rule , in terms of dollars saved and death prevented , far outweigh the costs to companies and consumers , according to peer - reviewed @entity1 studies			1
@entity7 power plants account for only about 1 % of global mercury emissions			0
even so , for each dollar spent reducing mercury and hazardous air pollutant emissions under the new rule , the @entity1 projects up to $ 9 in health benefit savings by preventing an estimated 11,000 premature deaths and 4,700 heart attacks each year			1
among children , the new limits are projected to prevent 130,000 cases of asthma and 6,300 cases of acute bronchitis each year , the @entity1 estimates			1
" these standards rank among the three or four most significant environmental achievements in the @entity1 's history , " said @entity49 , @entity50 director of the @entity51 , an environmental advocacy group			1
" this rule making represents a generational achievement			0
" despite federal limits on emissions of mercury from other sources , such as waste incinerators , there have been no limits on coal - fired power plants , which the @entity1 says constitute the single largest source of mercury emissions			1
" as a mom , i 'm especially excited to know that millions of mothers and babies will now be protected from mercury poisoning , " said @entity67 , director of @entity68 , a clean energy advocacy group			0
" we all teach our kids the simple rule that if you make a mess you should clean it up - and now polluters will have to follow that same rule , " she wrote in an e-mail conversation			0
" mothers around the country who have been worried about mercury pollution causing learning disabilities and other problems for their kids will be able to sleep easier tonight			0
" health experts have known for a long time that mercury causes damage to developing fetuses , with long - term effects on the child			0
methylmercury , found in fish and shellfish , can harm a child 's thinking , language , fine motor skills , memory , attention , and visual spatial skills when exposed in the womb			1
one study estimates that for each part per million of mercury found in a mother 's hair -- a common way of testing for mercury exposure -- her child loses approximately 0.18 iq points			1
outbreaks of methylmercury poisoning have resulted in some children being born with severe disabilities , even when their mothers did not show signs of nervous system damage			0
but adults are at risk for mercury poisoning too ; symptoms can include impairment of vision , speech , hearing and walking			0
in addition to mercury , the new @entity1 rule also limits emissions of hazardous air pollutants like arsenic , benzene , chromium , formaldehyde , hydrochloric acid , and nickel			1
how to protect against mercury exposure once airborne , mercury enters bodies of water through precipitation , becomes methylmercury , and accumulates in the food chain			0
the @entity1 and the @entity149 recommend that pregnant women and young children limit their consumption of fish and shellfish to two meals a week , because the methylmercury contamination found in fish can cause harm to humans			1
the @entity1 and @entity149 say that some larger predatory fish , such as shark , swordfish , king mackerel , and tilefish , should be avoided entirely by pregnant women and children			1
exposure can also occur from breathing in polluted air , for example near incinerators and coal - burning power plants			0
a lab test using blood or hair samples can determine the amount of methylmercury in the body			0
what 's the controversy ? the new rule requires that the vast majority of mercury contained in coal be captured and prevented from releasing into the air when burned for energy			1
it would require operators to shut down or upgrade the most environmentally dangerous power plants			0
power plant operators have three years to comply with the new standards , but plant operators may be granted additional time to install the necessary emissions improvement technologies if they are able to demonstrate a valid need			0
not everyone supports the new limits , in part because the new rules will increase costs for plant operators who need to make upgrades			0
the rule has been criticized by industry groups and some republicans			0
" analyses predict @entity1 's rules will force the premature retirement of power plants that are needed to provide affordable , reliable power to consumers and our growing economy , " said @entity205 , the chairman of the @entity206			1
" other plants will require multi-million dollar retrofits that will result in higher electricity bills , " said the @entity216 congressman from @entity217			0
the @entity1 states that its rule is cost - effective and " ensures electric reliability , " noting that the agency has received more than 900,000 comments from industry and the public to better inform the decision			2
amid a divisive political climate and persistent unemployment , the @entity1 noted in its march 2011 rule proposal that it " finds that more jobs will be created in the air pollution control technology production field than may be lost as the result of compliance with these proposed rules			1
" the final @entity1 rule regulating power plant mercury emissions has been decades in the making			1
the 1990 version of the @entity13 signed into law by president @entity241 directed the @entity1 to conduct studies to determine whether regulating mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from power plants was " appropriate and necessary			1
" in december 2000 , having completed the required studies , the @entity1 formally announced its intention to regulate mercury emissions from power plants			2
then in 2005 , under the administration of president @entity251 , the @entity1 reversed its determination that mercury regulations were " appropriate and necessary , " and removed power plants from the list of sources to be regulated			2
instead the @entity241 - era @entity1 proposed the " @entity257 , " a cap - and - trade system for mercury emissions			2
under " cap and trade , " mercury emissions would not be restricted , but heavy polluters would pay a fee that could be pocketed by companies whose factories or power plants pollute less			0
in february 2009 , the new epa administrator @entity267 announced a return to the 2000 decision to put limits on mercury emissions			2
the rule proposed on march 2011 was made final in an announcement on december 21 at the @entity273 in @entity274			0
altogether , the environmental regulations beginning with the 1970 @entity13 have saved millions of @entity7 lives , according to the @entity1			2
the reductions in fine particle and ozone pollution emissions mandated under the @entity13 prevented more than 160,000 cases of premature mortality , 130,000 heart attacks , and 1.7 million asthma attacks in just the year 2010 , according to @entity1 figures .			1

the new limits are projected to prevent 130,000 cases of asthma , 6,300 cases of bronchitis
methylmercury , found in fish and shellfish , can harm a child 's thinking , language
the new @entity1 rule also limits emissions of hazardous air pollutants like arsenic , benzene
