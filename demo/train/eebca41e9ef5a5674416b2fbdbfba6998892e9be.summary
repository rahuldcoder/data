shortly after the attack on the @entity3 diplomatic compound in @entity4 last september , a phone call was placed from the area			1
whoever made the call was excited			2
" @entity10 , @entity10 ! " he repeated , meaning " congratulations " in @entity9			0
two sources with high - level access to @entity14 intelligence services have told @entity15 the call was made to a senior figure in @entity18 , or @entity18			1
there is no proof that the call was specifically about the attack , in which @entity3 ambassador @entity23 and three other @entity3 were killed , but the sources say that is the assumption among those with knowledge of the call			1
@entity28 releases official timeline of @entity4 attack one of the sources says the phone call was discovered when a @entity14 intelligence service trawled through intercepts of communications made in the wake of the attack			1
that source told @entity15 that the call was made specifically to @entity40 , leader of an @entity18 faction based in northern @entity42			1
@entity44 officials told @entity15 they had no comment on whether any call had been intercepted			1
if the call was made and subsequently detected , it could fuel an already partisan debate in @entity50 over the @entity53 administration 's initial public characterization of the @entity4 attack , and what information @entity3 intelligence officials had about who was involved			1

on monday , sens. @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity71 - @entity70 , and @entity72 , @entity73 , issued a statement with more questions about the attack , saying : " we do not know what person or persons , representing what executive branch agency or agencies , changed the unclassified talking points to remove references to @entity84 and a terrorist attack in describing the attack on the @entity87 in @entity4			2
" read more : @entity4 tries to escape its ghosts , past and present the administration says the unclassified talking points were the basis for comments made by the @entity3 ambassador to the @entity93 , @entity94 , on television talk shows in the immediate aftermath of the attack			1
the senators added : " @entity84 , its affiliated groups , and local militias were able to establish sanctuaries almost uncontested in the ungoverned spaces of eastern @entity103			0
some of these individuals were involved in the attack on the @entity87 in @entity4			2
" @entity40 's links to @entity103 a veteran jihadist who had lost an eye while fighting in @entity108 as a teenager , @entity40 had established relationships with some of the more radical @entity103 militia , and at the time of the @entity4 attack was putting together an elite unit specifically to attack @entity14 interests in the @entity116 and @entity117			1
read more : what really happened in @entity4 ? a few months later , that unit carried out the attack on the @entity122 natural gas facility in southern @entity123 in which 33 foreign workers were killed			2
the group traveled through southern @entity103 on their way to the plant , according to counterterrorism officials			0
@entity130 officials say that @entity40 himself is now dead , killed saturday as @entity133 and @entity130 special forces penetrated the remote @entity135 mountain range in northeastern @entity42			1
but @entity133 defense minister @entity136 said monday there was no confirmation that either @entity40 or another senior figure in @entity18 , @entity140 , had been killed during the @entity133 campaign against @entity143 hideouts in northern @entity42			1
" i have no proof of the deaths of those two men , " @entity136 said			0
nor is there proof that @entity40 directed or was involved in the @entity4 attack			1
his group never claimed any responsibility for it			0
but in the weeks after that attack on september 11 , several senior @entity3 and @entity103 officials suggested that members of @entity18 may have been involved , without offering details			1
the president of @entity103 's parliament , @entity156 , asserted that @entity3 intelligence had intercepted communications between elements of @entity18 and @entity161 , a group widely blamed for playing a part in the attack			1
on september 19 @entity164 , director of the @entity165 , told a congressional committee : " we are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to @entity18 or @entity18 's affiliates ; in particular , @entity18			1
" and in november , gen. @entity173 , commander of @entity174 , said it was " very likely that some of the terrorists who participated in the attack in @entity4 have at least some linkages to @entity18			1
" " that is not to say that it was @entity18 which planned , or organized or led the activity but clearly some of the individuals had some linkages , " he said			2
soon after the @entity4 attack , @entity40 was relieved of his position as emir of the @entity116 and a deputy leader of @entity18			1
the group 's overall leader , @entity188 , appears to have lost patience with @entity40 's " freelance " kidnapping of @entity14 , which are reputed to have netted several million dollars			2
a written decree demoting @entity40 was taken to @entity195 , the city in northern @entity42 where @entity40 was based , and read out to the jihadist ranks there			0
some counterterrorism experts believe that @entity188 suspected @entity40 of a role in the @entity4 attack and was anxious that such a high - profile operation would promote a severe backlash from the @entity3 , setting back @entity18 's efforts to establish a foothold in @entity42 and @entity103			1
@entity40 was one of several leading militants based in @entity42 who spent time in @entity103 in the aftermath of @entity208 's overthrow , developing relationships with militant @entity143 brigades and buying weapons with the proceeds of smuggling and kidnapping operations			0
according to sources in direct contact with @entity14 intelligence agencies , @entity40 was in @entity103 for four months from december 2011			2
they say his visit was facilitated by the leader of a radical @entity143 militia with influence in @entity4 and the @entity223			2
according to the sources , he met a @entity103 veteran of jihad in @entity108 who had set up camps near @entity228 in southern @entity103 providing training for jihadists from @entity123 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity42 as well as @entity103 and ethnic @entity233			0
western intelligence officials believe the camps may have been used by those who attacked the @entity122 gas facility in january , according to the sources			0
across @entity117 and as far east as @entity238 , counterterrorism agencies are seeing a fluid movement of fighters , weapons and expertise among jihadist groups			0
the @entity244 reported in january that several of the militants involved in the @entity123 attack had also been in @entity4 in september , citing a senior @entity123 official			1
the official said one of the militants captured had described the @entity252 ' role in both assaults , according to the @entity244			0
asked about the report at a hearing of the @entity257 on january 23 , then - @entity3 secretary of state @entity254 said : " i can not confirm it			0
i can give you the background that i was able to obtain			0
this information is coming from the @entity123 government related to their questioning of certain of the terrorists that they took alive			0
" she also alluded to links between the attack in @entity123 and sources of weapons in @entity103			0
" the @entity272 of weapons coming out of these countries in the @entity275 and @entity117 is the source of one of our biggest threats			0
there is no doubt that the @entity123 terrorists had weapons from @entity103			0
... so we just have to do a much better job , " she said			0
the combination of different jihadist groups and factions , in shifting coalitions of the willing , has become a growing feature of the militant landscape , and one that makes tracking individuals and groups more difficult			0
instability in @entity117 -- especially in @entity103 and @entity42 -- has afforded these groups new space in which to operate .			0
