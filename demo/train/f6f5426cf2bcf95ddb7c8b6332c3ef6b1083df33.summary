-- something looked a little different on monday night 's 17th season premiere of @entity4 's " @entity3			1
" for one thing , the dancers and celebrities entered the stage on a red carpet set up just outside the studio , and then took their seats next to the judges ' table on stage			2
what used to be an upstairs " luxury box " for teams is now a " practice room " for last - minute preparation , and some couples had prerecorded music to use along with live band performances			2
that , and the judges have moved from one side of the stage to the other -- or , as host @entity27 called it , " @entity30 style			2
" but the more things change , the more they stayed the same on " dwts , " and the 12 teams brought their " a " games to the dance floor , to the delight of the audience			1
for " @entity40 " actress @entity39 , monday 's premiere brought tremendous praise from the judges and a 27 out of 30 for her cha - cha			1
@entity44 's 27 is three points better than " silver medalists " @entity47 and @entity48 , each of whom earned a 24 with a contemporary dance			1
fan favorite @entity52 also got off to a strong start thanks to a simple , classy foxtrot that earned her a 21 and a lengthy standing ovation from the audience			2
the actress proved to be quite nimble on the dance floor , so she could surprise in the coming weeks			0
the news was n't as good for " @entity60 " @entity61 , whose extremely awkward cha - cha , set to the theme song from " @entity65 , " garnered a 14 from the judges , including a 4 from resident malcontent @entity67			0
@entity61 stands in last place , three points behind football great @entity71 , but the tv personality has no regrets			0
" people do n't regret what they do , " @entity61 told @entity0 's @entity75 backstage			1
" they regret what they do n't do			0
" his statement would get a hearty " hear , hear ! " from @entity52 , who told @entity0 that she was focused on living life to the fullest with her new opportunity			0
" everyone should find their joy where they can , " the actress said			0
" there 's so much nonjoy that is out there , that it is suffocating us in a way			1
if we could get out of our mind and our ego and into our spirit , that 's a great entree into life			1
( do n't ) waste your time worrying about dying			0
live ! " @entity52 revealed in march that she had been diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , a condition in which cancer cells spread into the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord			0
@entity0 's @entity75 contributed to this report .			1
