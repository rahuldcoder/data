editor 's note : @entity2 holds the @entity4 chair in @entity5 and international affairs at @entity7			1
his most recent book is " the @entity9 : why @entity10 went @entity11			0
" @entity2 says the elite running @entity13 has lost the support of two key groups -- women and young voters			1
( @entity18 ) -- with an apparent political coup in @entity13 by president @entity21 and his supporters over the weekend , the ruling mullahs have dispensed with all democratic pretense and joined the ranks of traditional dictators in the @entity26			1
the hardliners in @entity28 , led by the @entity29 and ultraconservatives , have won the first round against reformist conservatives but at an extravagant cost : loss of public support			1
widespread accusations of fraud and manipulation are calling into question the very legitimacy and authority of the mullahs ' @entity43 - based regime			2
the electoral crisis has exposed a deepening divide between female and young voters , who represent about 70 percent of the population , and a radical conservative ruling elite out of touch with the hopes , fears and aspirations of young @entity13			1
the consensus in @entity13 , particularly among young voters , is that the election was stolen from reformist candidate , @entity56 , and that the outcome did not reflect the electorate 's genuine will			1
after the @entity61 announced the final election results showing a nearly 2 - to - 1 landslide for @entity21 ( 62.63 to 33.75 percent ) , thousands of young protesters took to the streets and clashed with police and set trash bins and tires ablaze			1
shock and disbelief turned to anger and rage			0
what poured gasoline on a simmering fire among the youth was a belief of widespread fraud			0
" it 's like taking 10 million votes away from @entity56 and giving them to @entity21 , " said @entity28 - based analyst @entity78			2
that is equivalent to more than 30 million votes in the @entity84 electorate			0
" death to the dictatorship " and " down with the dictator " shouted the demonstrators while being clubbed by police and anti-riot squads			0
for the first time , young @entity13 showed defiance against their tormentors and overcame their fear			1
many young men reportedly roamed @entity28 streets looking for a fight with the police			2
the ruling mullahs face an unprecedentedly serious crisis at home			1
while it does not threaten their existence , the crisis risks undermining their ability to govern effectively and pursue a successful foreign policy			0
in his first response to the results of the election , @entity56 nailed it on the head			2
" i wo n't surrender to this manipulation , " he wrote on his web site			0
" the result of such performance by some officials will jeopardize the pillars of the @entity117 and will establish tyranny			0
" @entity56 's warning to the mullahs that stealing the election would weaken the very foundation of their regime and ultimately bring about its collapse carries weight because he has been part of the political inner circle of the @entity117 , not an outsider			1
@entity56 is a former prime minister admired for the way he managed the country 's economy during the prolonged and bloody @entity133 in the 1980s , a conflict which cost @entity13 over $ 500 billion			1
he worked closely with @entity134 , then @entity13 's president and today supreme leader , and clashed with him over political authority and powers			1
@entity56 is a member of @entity13 's @entity138 , which mediates between the parliament and the non-elected @entity140 led by @entity134			1
initially , many reformists were skeptical about @entity56 's reform credentials and feared that he was too conservative for their taste			2
throughout the presidential campaign , @entity56 labored hard to portray his proposals on social policy and foreign affairs as an extension of the @entity43 system in order to disarm conservative critics , even denying that he is a mainstream reformist candidate in the hope of winning the support of reformers and moderate conservatives			2
indeed , as the presidential campaign progressed , @entity56 won the backing not only of an important conservative segment of the electorate but also the formidable youth constituency			0
his charismatic wife , @entity161 , electrified the female vote and won the hearts and minds of women voters who flooded their campaign rallies			1
in the past two weeks , @entity56 's campaign gained momentum			2
there was increasing evidence that the tide was turning and that women and young voters would tip the balance of power his way , if they turned out to vote in large numbers			1
some important facts : there are 46 million eligible voters in @entity13 , half of whom are women			1
in 1997 , more than 60 percent of the votes that brought moderate @entity183 to power were cast by women , and in 2000 , women voters were instrumental in giving reformists a sweeping majority in the @entity188			1
promising greater individual freedoms to youths was instrumental in the two landslide victories by @entity183 in 1997 and 2001			0
surely , if the turnout was 85 percent as the @entity61 said , @entity56 should have done much better than the mere 33.8 percent he supposedly received			0
according to many independent media reports from all over @entity13 , women and young voters turned out in record numbers , especially in cities where @entity56 is very popular			1
that should have given @entity56 a comfortable lead over the incumbent			0
multiple irregularities were reported , including the fact that @entity56 supposedly lost the vote in his home province			0
there is an alarming discrepancy between the final results and the voting patterns of the @entity13 electorate over more than a decade			1
lack of transparency in the vote count has reinforced @entity13 ' suspicion			1
the weight of evidence is at odds with the final outcome given by the @entity61			0
before @entity56 formally appealed the election result , supreme leader @entity134 closed the door for any possible compromise			2
in a message on state tv , he urged the nation to unite behind @entity21 , calling the result a " divine assessment			0
" yet the @entity140 , not @entity134 , is the authority that either ratifies or annuls the results			0
it is refreshing that @entity134 has finally ordered an investigation into allegations of ballot fraud			0
it is a good start			0
a more reassuring intiative would be for the @entity140 to order a full recount with the presence of independent observers			0
that would go a long way to putting to rest @entity13 ' concerns			2
in the meantime , trying to divert attention from the mess at home , @entity134 and @entity21 have blamed external " enemies " and " foreign media " for instigating a " full - fledged fight against our people			0
" the truth is that the crisis is internal and has nothing to do with foreign media or the @entity250			0
the @entity252 administration has done the right thing by keeping a low profile and not actively interfering in @entity13 's unfolding domestic crisis			1
unlike his predecessor , @entity252 has defused the minefield of relations between @entity259 and @entity28 , shifting the focus of @entity13 to their own society			1
but the disputed result shows that the ultraconservative mullahs are not only out of touch with a plurality of their citizens but also with reality			2
their conduct reflects a deeper crisis of self - confidence and fear of the future			0
has the @entity43 revolution run out of ideological steam ? if the mullahs fear @entity56 , a loyalist , they must be scared of their shadows and uncertain about their authority and power			0
that speaks volumes about where the @entity117 is and where it is heading			0
the mullahs are swimming against the dominant current of @entity13 society			1
in the next four years , @entity13 will likely be engulfed in social and political turmoil unless the electoral crisis is resolved in a transparent manner			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity13 's ruling mullahs *forfeited* their public support in the election
@entity2 : ruling mullahs are out of step with women and young voters
he says hardliners are swimming against the current of @entity13 society
