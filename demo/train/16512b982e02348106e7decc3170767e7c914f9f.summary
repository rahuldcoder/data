background : how remote rock split @entity4 , @entity5 the @entity9 , a key military ally of @entity5 , has called on the two sides to find a peaceful resolution to the disagreement , which is generating more and more unease in the region and starting to hurt economic links between the world 's second and third largest economies			1
" it 's in everybody 's interest for @entity5 and @entity4 to maintain good relations and to find a way to avoid further escalation , " @entity9 defense secretary @entity37 said monday at a joint new conference in @entity0 with his @entity5 counterpart , @entity39			1
despite describing the @entity9 - @entity5 alliance as the " bedrock of peace and stability " in the @entity33 , @entity37 reiterated that @entity50 does n't take a position on competing sovereignty claims			2
he did , however , express concern about the demonstrations in @entity4			1

it is halting work at the factories until tuesday , it said , as well as at a plant in @entity67 , @entity68 , where some employees have staged a strike over the island issue			0
unrest took place in dozens of other cities in @entity4 over the weekend			1
thousands of protesters hurled bottles and eggs outside the @entity5 @entity78 in @entity21 on saturday , expressing anger over @entity0 's announcement last week that it had acquired several of the disputed islands from a @entity5 family to bring them under public ownership			1
@entity4 declared the purchase to be " illegal " and sent six surveillance vessels to carry out patrols on friday around the remote islands in an effort to underscore its claim to sovereignty			1
the ships briefly entered @entity5 territorial waters despite warnings not to do so , the @entity92 said			0
the islands , situated in the @entity24 between @entity97 and @entity98 , are under @entity5 control , but @entity4 claims they have been a part of its territory " since ancient times			1
" @entity33 's disputed islands -- who claims what ? the events last week ratcheted up the tensions between the two @entity109 nations , where lingering resentment from past conflicts remains close to the surface			1
that was in evidence in @entity21 at the weekend			1
waving @entity4 national flags and holding portraits of the late leader @entity117 , the mostly young protesters chanted " down with @entity5 imperialism " and called for war as they made their way down the streets under the watchful eyes of police and guards			2

the demonstrators began smashing large plant pots and other objects in the street so they could throw the shards at the police , @entity145 said			0
the @entity19 tone of the protest was clear from the slogans and images on display , he added			2
@entity5 news media organizations have also reported incidents of assaults on @entity5 citizens in @entity4 in the past few days			2

in @entity21 , police walking alongside the demonstrators were seen to ask spectators to join in instead of blocking the street			0
by saturday night , @entity4 's state - run media had started appealing for restraint , running commentaries that condemned violence and lectured the public on the expression of patriotism			0

animosity between @entity4 and @entity5 over the disputed islands runs deep			1
they have come to represent what many @entity4 see as unfinished business : redressing the impact of the @entity5 occupation of large swathes of eastern @entity4 during the 1930s and 1940s			0
@entity4 says its claim goes back hundreds of years			0
@entity5 says it saw no trace of @entity4 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity5 sovereign territory in 1895			2
@entity5 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers			0
the @entity5 surrender at the end of @entity220 in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further			0
the islands were administered by the @entity9 occupation force after the war			0
but in 1972 , @entity50 returned them to @entity5 as part of its withdrawal from @entity97			0
a public initiative begun in april this year by the outspoken governor of @entity0 , @entity229 , to raise money to acquire the islands for the city authorities set off a new cycle of tensions that included civilian protesters from both sides landing on the islands to stake their nations ' claims			1
@entity229 's move put pressure on the government of prime minister @entity243 to step in with its own bid , which resulted in the controversial deal last week with the @entity247 family , the private owners up until that point			0
@entity5 's attempts to portray the purchase as a routine internal real - estate transaction , with the islands passing from one @entity5 owner to another , has failed to placate the @entity4 authorities			2
