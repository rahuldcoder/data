@entity0 -- two years after the terror attack on the @entity5 diplomatic compound in @entity6 , @entity7 , many @entity2 still have unanswered questions about security issues related to the incident			1
many democrats say that after dozens of hearings , briefings , probes and reports on the subject , this latest committee could amount to nothing more than a fishing expedition			2
one thing both parties agreed on at wednesday 's first hearing of the latest inquiry - the new @entity20 - was that substantial security improvements by the @entity26 and an eye to the lessons of the past are necessary to prevent future @entity5 deaths			1
the september 11 , 2012 , attack left @entity5 ambassador @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 dead , and immediately sparked controversy , with republicans accusing the @entity39 administration of mishandling the attack and manipulating the talking points used to discuss it for political reasons			1
numerous investigations into the attack have been championed on the right by media organizations and by @entity2 , including former presidential candidate @entity48 and @entity50 chairman @entity49			1
the goal of this latest committee -- the @entity20 -- is to " produce the final , definitive accounting on behalf of @entity53 of what happened before , during and after the terrorist attacks on our facilities in @entity6 , " according to committee communications director @entity58			1
wednesday 's hearing , titled " implementation of the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) recommendations " -- a topic the committee spokesman said was selected by @entity11 -- was aimed at examining the steps being taken to implement a series of proposals to make sure high threat diplomatic posts get the security they need			2
@entity71 , assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security , @entity71 , former director of the @entity73 and @entity74 , former assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at the @entity76 testified before the committee			2

now is the time for the @entity26 to finally institutionalize some real , meaningful and progressive change , " @entity74 , also a member of the @entity61 's @entity84 on @entity85 , said in his opening remarks			2
" they ca n't lose this moment			2
words and cursory actions by the @entity26 ring hollow absent transparency and verifiable and sustainable actions			2
" past recommendations ignored ? @entity74 , @entity20 chairman rep. @entity97 ( @entity98 ) and other members said too often the recommendations made after a security failure have been ignored			0
@entity97 cited proposals presented after the @entity104 embassy bombing in 1983 and the 1998 bombings of the @entity5 embassies in @entity107 and @entity108			1
" it is stunning to see the similarities between the recommendations made decades ago and the recommendations made by the @entity113 and , if you doubt that , i want you to compare the recommendations of those made 25 , a quarter of a century ago , 25 years ago , with the recommendations made by the @entity113 , " @entity97 said			2
" we do not suffer from a lack of recommendations			0
we do suffer from a lack of implementing and enacting those recommendations and that has to end			0
" @entity125 rep. @entity124 , the ranking @entity126 on the committee who has accused @entity2 of politicizing the @entity6 attack , said his goal was to focus on reform efforts and to learn from past tragedies			1
@entity124 called the attack a " transformational moment " -- a comment later echoed by @entity74 and @entity2 members			1
related : war against @entity139 - what does @entity136 's ' yes ' mean ? one high - energy exchange between @entity142 @entity2 @entity141 and @entity74 focused one of the @entity145 's 40 recommendations that the @entity26 create a new post -- undersecretary for diplomatic security , to help make sure one designated official would be accountable for security			1
@entity74 said that was the panel 's top recommendation			0
" in our executive summary we said one clear and overarching recommendation is crucial to the successful and sustainable implementation of all the recommendations in this report is the creation of an undersecretary , " @entity74 said			0
state has declined to implement that recommendation , even though it is similar to one made after the @entity165 embassy bombings , @entity74 said			0
@entity141 slammed the agency 's track record			0
" what 's it going to take for the @entity26 to put in place the practices that will save @entity5 lives ? " he asked			1
" they did n't follow their own standards that were developed in 1983 after the @entity104 embassy bombing			0
they did n't follow the waiver policy to deviate from those standards and now they 're not following the @entity145 's number 1 recommendation			0
what 's it going to take ? " @entity71 said the department looked at the recommendation very seriously and decided what was most important was that he had direct access to the secretary			0
" i am directly reportable to the secretary for security threat information and security threats against our people , " he said			0
@entity71 said a good deal of progress had been made in implementing other recommendations to mitigate the risk to @entity5 personnel in dangerous places			1
" like you , we want to keep our people safe , " said @entity71 in his opening testimony , but he also warned that " while we can do everything we can to reduce the risk , we can never eliminate it fully			0
" @entity71 , who was also chairman of the @entity84 on @entity85 , said better communication , planning and logistics and risk management might have helped prevent the deaths in @entity6 and said improvements were being made in each of those areas			1
@entity71 and @entity74 raised questions about whether @entity5 personnel even need to be stationed in dangerous places and said there must be a risk - management process in place to answer that key question in each instance			1
" we need to ask the question , why are we in the most dangerous places ? " @entity71 said			0
" and the 30 places that we identified as the highest threat , highest risk , that 's exactly what we 're doing , going through every single one of those 30 and doing this vital presence validation process			0
the first step is , what is our national interest for being there ? "			0
