@entity1 sen. @entity0 may repeatedly say she is n't running for president in 2016 , but do n't tell that to the nation 's largest liberal grassroots organization			1
@entity7 , an 8 - million member liberal grassroots organization , is poised to kick off a $ 1 million campaign to draft @entity10 for president in 2016			1
the plan will be put to @entity7 members tuesday morning , but because of the @entity17 senator 's popularity with the liberals , the plan is expected to easily pass			1
the campaign includes @entity7 opening offices and hiring staff in @entity21 and @entity22 , two states that are critically important in the presidential nomination process , and " the assembly of a national volunteer army ready to go to work if sen. @entity10 enters the race			2
" if passed , @entity7 will also begin producing " ads and media products that call attention to how sen. @entity10 has stood up and fought for the middle class and her powerful vision for our country 's future			2
" " there is too much at stake to have anything other than our best candidates in the debate , " @entity37 , executive director of @entity38 , said in a statement			0
" we are prepared to show senator @entity10 she has the support she needs to enter — and win — the presidential race			0
" @entity10 has said a number of times that she is not running for president , despite all the liberal excitement around her possible candidacy			0
through her lawyer , @entity10 even disavowed @entity58 , a super pac hoping to draft the liberal senator			2
" as senator @entity10 has said many times , she is not running for president , " @entity61 , @entity10 's press secretary , said on tuesday			0
that said , should she decide to run , @entity10 would be far from the first presidential hopeful to backtrack on a pledge not to do so			0
" this is a huge opportunity for @entity7 members , if they choose , to inspire senator @entity10 as she has inspired so many of us , " said @entity68 , executive director of @entity69			2
@entity7 's campaign is as much a boost to @entity10 as it is a slight to @entity76 , the @entity77 frontrunner for the 2016 nomination and someone who has failed to connect with some liberal activists			1
@entity7 organizers wo n't fault @entity82 directly , but they regularly talk about finding a nominee that fits the moment for @entity77 , not someone associated with what they see as a longtime rigged political system			2
polling , however , has shown that self - identified liberals overwhelmingly back the former secretary of state			0
in a july @entity2 / @entity93 , 66 % of liberals said they would back @entity82 over people like @entity10 , vice president @entity95 and @entity97 gov. @entity96			0
in the same poll , only 13 % of liberal backed @entity10			0
but in polls of strictly members of liberal groups , @entity10 fares much better			0
in a november poll of @entity106 's one million members , @entity10 garnered 42 % support , compared to 24 % for @entity109 independent senator @entity108 and 23 % for @entity82			1
@entity7 is not the only liberal political group pushing for a @entity10 run			1
@entity106 said tuesday it would poll its members about joining the " @entity10 " effort			1
" @entity1 consultants can spout off a dozen reasons why @entity0 should n't run , but none of that beltway blather means a thing next to this one , simple truth : the @entity77 and our country desperately need @entity10 's voice in the 2016 presidential debate , " @entity106 executive director @entity120 said in a statement out tuesday .			1

@entity7 is a liberal grassroots *advocacy* group with 8 million members

the liberal group is *widely* expected to *approve* the vote and put $ 1 million into the campaign
