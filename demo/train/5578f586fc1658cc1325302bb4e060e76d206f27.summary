-- @entity3 , the wife of a former @entity5 assistant basketball coach accused of molesting ball boys , plans to sue @entity7 and two of the network 's reporters for libel in a federal court , her lawyers said wednesday			1
a draft of the lawsuit says sports journalists @entity20 and @entity22 " spitefully destroyed @entity3 's reputation in an attempt to capitalize financially in the tragic wake of the @entity19 sex abuse scandal			1
" it says @entity3 's reputation was ruined by the malicious publication of false and defamatory accusations			1
in response , @entity7 backed its stories			1
" the suit is without merit and we stand by our reporting , " the sports programming network said			2
@entity3 broke her months - long silence wednesday to talk about the accusations against her			1
" i 'm here today as a wife and a mother who has had to endure the trauma of being smeared in the public as a monster , " she said at a news conference			0
" my life has been destroyed by the defamation i have suffered , and this will last a lifetime			0
" @entity3 called the lawsuit the first step to restore her reputation			1
" i have never engaged in or condone despicable conduct falsely reported by @entity7 , " she said			1
" they have maliciously attacked me in order to attack my husband			0
" the @entity7 reporting has forced her to live in seclusion and impaired her ability to volunteer in the community , she said			1
" they should apologize and retract these horrible lies , " she said			1
among the false accusations @entity3 alleges in the lawsuit are : â € ¢ creating a space in which children could be sexually molested in secret			1
â € ¢ witnessing her husband sexually molest children , but not doing anything to stop it			0
â € ¢ knowingly permitting the sexual molestation of children in her home			0
her husband , @entity69 , was fired from @entity5 in november after several ball boys came forward and said the basketball coach molested them			2
@entity69 has not been charged with a crime			2
he has maintained his innocence , saying shortly after the allegations surfaced that they were " patently false in every aspect			0
" @entity76 and his stepbrother , @entity77 , who are former @entity5 ball boys , were the first to step forward publicly last year with allegations against @entity3			2
another man , @entity80 , made similar accusations later , filed a lawsuit and then admitted that he made up the story			0
a prison inmate , @entity84 , also made the same allegations , only to recant them			0
the draft lawsuit details the @entity88 ' relationship with @entity76			0
" the fines mentored @entity76 when he got in trouble , " it says			0
" rather than humiliating him in front of @entity3 or their other children , @entity69 often came home from work , and sternly spoke to him , in private , as if he were his own teenage son			1
" @entity76 was family , and when he messed up , the @entity88 made sure he learned from his poor decisions , even if that required occasional parental corporal punishment and reprimanding			0
" it says that the @entity88 gave @entity76 money but that he took advantage of their generosity by making up " countless stories " to " gain the @entity88 ' sympathy and justify his requests for money			0
" when @entity76 told @entity3 that her husband had sexually molested him , the draft says , " @entity3 ' went off ' on @entity76 because @entity76 finally crossed the line			2
" " @entity69 assured @entity3 that it was just another one of @entity76 ' fabricated stories , " the draft says			1
" @entity3 would patiently suffer @entity76 ' vilification of her husband with the hope that @entity76 would eventually outgrow the lies and his dependency upon her family for financial support			2
" @entity3 made headlines last year when @entity7 and the @entity122 newspaper in @entity5 released details of a 10 - year - old taped conversation with @entity76 that appeared to show she knew about her husband 's alleged sexual abuse			1
in the tape , the woman that @entity7 , citing experts , identified as @entity3 said she knew " everything that went on " with her husband , adding that " he thinks he 's above the law			1
" " @entity69 has issues ... and you trusted somebody you should n't , " the woman said , speaking to @entity76			2
the woman appears to acknowledge an inappropriate sexual relationship between @entity76 and @entity69 , saying , " it 's just wrong , and you were a kid			2
" she also said that her husband should " find ( himself ) a gay boy , get your rocks off			0
" the lawsuit refers to that recording as " an admittedly doctored , substantially inaudible , and entirely speculative tape , which @entity76 purported to be a recoding of a telephone conversation between he and @entity3 in 2002			1
" @entity7 changed the audio quality , produced only portions of the tape and presented it out of context " such that the tape seriously misleads and misrepresents the conversation that occurred , " said @entity152 , @entity3 's attorney			1
@entity3 's nephew , @entity154 , said at the time that the voice on the tape was his aunt 's but that the tape was " all tampered with			1
" last week , a @entity158 justice dismissed a defamation lawsuit against @entity5 longtime head basketball coach @entity160			0
the suit was filed in december by @entity76 and @entity77			0
@entity160 initially supported @entity3 , a longtime friend and colleague , accusing @entity77 and @entity76 of fabricating their accusations of @entity3 's alleged misconduct			2
the coach later apologized for his comments			0
justice @entity168 of the @entity169 @entity158 ruled that the initial statements made to media outlets by @entity160 " were likely to be an opinion -- a biased , passionate , and defensive point of view of a basketball coach -- rather than objective fact			0
thus , plaintiff 's defamation claim against @entity160 fails as a matter of law			0
