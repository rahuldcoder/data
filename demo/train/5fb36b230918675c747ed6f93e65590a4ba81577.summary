-- imagine that the chair you 're sitting on became a sofa on demand as the day moved from light to dark			0
or if all your furnishings could move out of your way as you walk through a room			0
these thoughts could one day become reality through research being conducted at the @entity12 ( @entity12 )			0
the @entity12 biorobotics lab is developing self - configurable robotics known as " @entity15 , " which can merge with materials and furnishings to create adaptable furniture for the home and office			1
" it 's a bit of a science - fiction project in my lab to create intelligent furniture which can change shape and functionality , " explains lab director @entity22			1
" we envisage the @entity15 moving and combining to create a diversity of elements including tables and chairs			1
" the goal is to create furniture that can be re-used in multiple ways			2

each module is just 22cm long and the team imagine just 10 of them could combine to build a broad range of furniture			1
" the @entity15 would be coupled with more passive materials such as a table top or cushion to create the end results , " says @entity22			1
however , the team 's immediate goals are to create mobile furniture to assist the elderly and those with reduced mobility			1
" let 's say an elderly person is using a walker , the furniture could have modules attached for it to move out of the way in a cluttered apartment or have a stool follow the person and remain close by , " describes @entity22			2
for now , the team have managed to enable a few modules to interact , coordinated by algorithms on a pc , but they plan to improve human - robot interactions by either embedding cameras to track where users are or using voice recognition for people to instruct their furniture			2
further hopes lie in using tablets to display a room virtually , with people using augmented reality to then move and place furnishings as they desire			0
" eventually we want less and less human interaction to have a more fluid transition of furniture , " says @entity22			0
designs are n't limited to the home and could be applied to the workplace to create high - end conference rooms that reconfigure according to functionality , and eventually anywhere , with people creating their own uses for the building blocks			0
" what i really hope is to provide @entity105 blocks for people to find their own use such as artists or designers , " says @entity22			0

robots known as " @entity15 " are *paving* the way for furniture that can build itself
@entity15 will combine active and passive parts to create all *kinds* of furnishings
each roombot is a small cube and contains batteries , motors and a wireless connection
mobile furniture could *benefit* the elderly and people with poor mobility
