-- @entity1 is trying to make interactive pictures happen , again			1
the @entity4 startup made a splash three years ago with its first @entity1 camera , which let users refocus an image after shooting it			1
now @entity1 is back with a new , higher - end and more powerful camera , the $ 1,600 @entity11			1
the @entity11 is hefty but slick - looking , with minimal buttons , a noninterchangable zoom lens and a matte - black finish			2
visually , it has little in common with the original @entity1 , a small rectangular box that did n't bear much resemblance to any traditional camera			1
inside it uses a higher - grade version of its light - field technology to snap what the company calls " living pictures " -- photographs in which you can change the focus on different subjects in the frame long after you 've shot them			0
the allure of these unique images is not having to worry about making sure a photo is in focus in the moment			0
the photos are also " interactive " for all viewers , who can tinker with the image later on a computer or mobile device , bringing one subject or an entire scene into focus with a tap or a click			2
the company believes that these types of interactive photos are the next evolution in photography			0
" we think that if you look at how pictures work today in the world and on the @entity54 , we 're really still tied to the legacy of print , " said @entity1 ceo @entity49			2
" this will really replace digital in the way that digital has replaced film			0
" better than its predecessor @entity1 was founded by @entity64 graduate student @entity63 , the brains behind turning light - field technology into a commercial product			1
after raising $ 50 million in funding , @entity1 released its first product , a camera for consumers , in 2011			1
its first @entity1 was much - hyped but pricey at $ 399			1
while the company has been hesitant to share exact sales numbers , the lack of @entity1 " living images " filling up your social media feeds or websites indicates the camera did n't quite take off			1
it was seen as a cool gadget with one clever trick up its sleeve , and was alternately praised as groundbreaking and dismissed as a gimmick			0
the first @entity1 camera also suffered from low - quality images , a subject the @entity1 team eluded by insisting that @entity1 photos can not be measured in mere megapixels			1
the @entity1 format is an entirely new type of photograph that is measured in megarays			2
the original @entity1 took 11 - megaray photos and the @entity11 takes 40 - megaray shots			1
having four times the amount of megarays sounds cool , but what does it actually look like ? @entity49 says that if you were to export a @entity11 image into a traditional flat photo , it would be the equivalent of 4 to 6 megapixels			1
it 's better , but still a long way from @entity112 quality			0
the company says its new camera is " professional grade " and should appeal to full - time photographers and artists			1
it begins shipping in july but is available for preorders immediately			0
the design of the @entity11 includes a tilted 4 - inch touchscreen inspired by the way smartphone photographers hold their phones and the old @entity127 viewfinders , where you look down			2
the thick lens has a 30 - 250mm zoom range with a consistent f / 2.0 aperture			0
while composing a shot , you can hit a button on top of the camera to play with depth and focus in real time on the touchscreen			0
there 's a color overlay that shows you what parts of the scene can be brought into focus later			0
the guts of the camera are far more powerful than the original @entity1			1
the operating system is built on @entity147 with a speedy @entity149 processor inside			0
it has wireless capabilities , and the 1 - inch optical format sensor is four times larger than the first @entity1 sensor			2
a bold strategy one hurdle still facing the company is that the light - field image format is n't widely supported and the images are best hosted on @entity1 's site and viewed in custom @entity1 mobile and desktop apps			1
some social networks such as @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 have added special support for @entity1 images			2
@entity168 shows them , but the originals are hosted on @entity1 's site			2
@entity171 for the semiprofessional market is an interesting strategy for @entity1 , whose original camera occupied a dying gray area in the photography industry alongside the amateur point - and - shoot			1
it was n't a professional camera , and it was n't packed inside a smartphone			0
many thought a partnership with a smartphone or camera company would have been an ideal solution for @entity1			1
in the beginning , @entity63 did try to license the technology to the big optics companies , but he did n't have any luck			0
so he decided to make his own hardware instead			0
" transformational tech needs a transformative product to bring the full benefits , " said @entity63 , who is now @entity1 's executive chairman			2
@entity49 also dismisses the idea of just licensing the light - field technology			0
he believes that 's like saying @entity197 in its early days was just going to be an electric battery and engine company			0
instead , @entity1 insists on being a consumer - focused hardware startup			0
this may prove a challenge in software - driven @entity4 , where billion - dollar companies are built relatively cheaply on lines of code			0
but with a $ 40 million injection of new funding , an entirely new product for a different audience and a renewed push to make a different photo format catch on , @entity1 is confident in its technology and ready to try again .			1

the camera company @entity1 is back with its second product , the $ 1,600 @entity11
@entity1 cameras let you take a photo and refocus the image later on a computer
the new @entity11 is more powerful than the original @entity1 and aimed at a more professional market
