@entity0 -- eating a box of @entity3 in one sitting will be a little bit easier this year : the @entity6 confirmed wednesday that it has reduced the number of cookies per box to save money because of rising transportation and baking costs			1
people buying girl scout cookies like these on their web site this year can expect fewer cookies in the packages			1
@entity18 , a national @entity3 spokeswoman , said that " the cost of baking a cookie today is significantly higher than it was even a year ago , and our bakers can not continue to absorb these rising costs			1
" she also said transportation costs have increased 30 to 40 percent from a year ago			0
the combined cost increase prompted the organization to " lower the net weight of our cookie boxes slightly rather than ask our customers to pay a higher per - package price during these difficult times , " @entity18 said in a written statement			2
there will be two to four fewer cookies in boxes of @entity3 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , she said			1
the @entity6 also reduced the size of some cookies , but @entity43 lovers should n't worry that their sweet snacks will get any slimmer : only the @entity46 will change shape			1
@entity18 said it is too early to tell how @entity3 sales will fare for the year			2
she said the cookie - selling season ranges from october to may , with the bulk occurring between january and march			0
each individual council determines when its scouts will sell , and many have just begun in the past few weeks			0
@entity18 said she 's heard a range of comments on how sales are going : one council in @entity59 is having its best year ever , which attributes to new marketing , and other groups are reporting low numbers			0
sales average $ 700 million a year , she said			0
" we hope @entity3 lovers will understand the situation and continue to support our girls , " she said			2
" as the premier leadership organization for girls , we also intend to use these circumstances as a business learning experience for the girls			0
