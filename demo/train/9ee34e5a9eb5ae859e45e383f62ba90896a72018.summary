their children said they were nine days short of their 66th wedding anniversary			1
" it 's consoling to us that they went together , " said their daughter , @entity25			2
" on one hand it 's difficult to lose both parents at once when you did n't see it coming ... but it 's very consoling that they got to go together			2
" according to @entity25 , her father 's health had been deteriorating more quickly than her mother 's for about a year			2
" we would ask , ' why is he still here ? ' " @entity25 said			2
" and the answer was that he was here for @entity42			2
" " he loved her very dearly			2
he wanted to be here with her , " she added			2
" he would sleep all day toward the end but when he 'd wake the first thing he 'd ask is , ' where 's your mother ? how 's your mother ? ' " decades of love sound like this @entity25 said @entity18 contracted a rare infection shortly before her death and it was clear she was not going to recover			1
when @entity25 and her siblings told her father the news , she recalled , he took it calmly but they saw a " shift " in him			0
just a few days later , @entity25 and one of her sisters noticed that their father appeared to be very ill , she said			0
" my sister said , ' it 's almost like he 's trying to catch up to @entity42			0
' " three days later , @entity17 died , at 7:30 a.m. " i think he realized what was happening and wanted to pave the way for her , " the couple 's son , @entity67 , said			1
after their father died , the @entity73 children surrounded their mother -- who was not lucid -- and told her , " @entity76 's up there waiting			1
they got the card game going and it 's time you got up there			0
do n't stick around for us , " @entity67 said			0
@entity83 died that night , at 6:30 p.m. " i think certainly when two people are that close for 66 years you become pretty in sync mentally			1
so regardless of their state i think they realized it was time , " @entity67 said			0
@entity18 and @entity17 met when they were students at the same elementary school in @entity22 but were separated when @entity17 's family moved several towns away , according to @entity95 , another daughter of the @entity96			1
" @entity76 was a year ahead of @entity42 and i remember @entity42 would tell us , ' i had a crush on your dad when i was in the third grade , ' " @entity25 said			0
it was n't until @entity17 was serving in @entity4 and stationed in @entity103 that their relationship began			1
@entity18 's brother - in - law @entity106 , who was also serving , overheard that @entity17 was from the same county in @entity22 as @entity18 and suggested that @entity17 write to her			1
their relationship grew from there , according to their daughter @entity110			0
" @entity42 knew who he was right away , " @entity25 said of her mother 's reaction to the letter			0
the two continued to write each other until @entity17 returned from the war in 1945			1
the couple married two years later , on august 20 , 1947 , and had six children together : @entity95 , @entity122 , @entity25 , @entity110 , @entity67 and @entity17 worked in @entity22 's @entity124 school system as a principal , teacher and coach and @entity18 became a school secretary			1
" i guess to me , the most important part of the story was their dedication to each other -- loyal right to the end , " @entity129 said			0
" supportive and protective of each other , and that was the beautiful part			0
they worked at being married for 65 years			1
it did n't just happen			0
they went into it with the idea that this was forever , and it was			0
they made it that way			0
" the two were laid to rest together in a joint funeral			0
" @entity42 were ordinary people , " @entity110 said			0
" i guess if people can learn from our story it 's that there is love that lasts , and that 's a good thing			2
