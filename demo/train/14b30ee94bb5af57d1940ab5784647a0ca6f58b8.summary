-- the beating of @entity2 20 years ago thursday marked the end of a 100 - mph car chase and the beginning of a chain of events that would forever change @entity8 , its police department and the racial conversation in the @entity11			1
@entity2 , then a 25 - year - old convicted robber on parole , admittedly had a few drinks under his belt as he headed home from a friend 's house			1
when he spotted a police car following him , he panicked , thinking he would be sent back to prison			1
" i had a job to go to that monday , and i knew i was on parole , and i knew i was n't supposed to be drinking , and i 'm like , ' @entity24 , ' " @entity2 told @entity0 in a recent interview			1
realizing he could n't outrun police but knowing what they were likely to do to him when they caught him , @entity2 said he looked for a public place to stop			1
" i saw all those apartments over there , so i said , ' i 'm gon na stop right there			2
if it goes down , somebody will see it			2
' " it did go down			2
four police officers , all of them white , struck @entity2 more than 50 times with their wood batons and shocked him with an electric stun gun			1
" ' we are going to kill you , n * * * * r , ' " @entity2 said police shouted as they beat him			1
the officers denied using racial slurs			2
@entity2 was right in his expectation of a beating , but his hope of having a witness was fulfilled in a big way			1
not only did somebody see it , somebody videotaped it -- still a novelty in 1991 , before people had cell phone cameras			2
the video showed a large lump of a man floundering on the ground , surrounded by a dozen or more police officers , four of whom were beating him relentlessly with nightsticks			1
one officer 's swings slow down as he appears worn out by his nonstop flailing			1
@entity2 was beaten nearly to death			1
three surgeons operated on him for five hours that morning			2
the dramatic video of the episode appeared on national tv two days later			2
at last , blacks in @entity8 -- and no doubt in other parts of the country -- had evidence to document the police brutality many had known but most of @entity11 had always denied or tolerated			2
" we finally caught the @entity81 with a camcorder , " @entity2 attorney @entity80 said			1
four @entity84 officers -- @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and sgt. @entity88 -- were indicted on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police officer			2
in april 1992 , after a three - month trial in the predominantly white suburb of @entity97 , three of the officers were acquitted of all charges			0
but the jury , which had no black members , was deadlocked on one charge of excessive force against @entity86			0
a mistrial was declared on that charge			0
@entity86 's attorney , @entity106 , said the unedited video worked against @entity2 and helped prove the officers ' case			1
" most of the nation only saw a few snippets where it 's the most violent			2
they did n't see him get up and run at @entity86 , " @entity106 said			0
" in a use - of - force case , if the officers do what they 're trained to do , how can you find them guilty of a crime ? and the jury understood that			0
" still , black @entity8 exploded in outrage			0
rioters rampaged through the streets , looting businesses , torching buildings and attacking people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time			0
on the third day of rioting , @entity2 emerged from seclusion to make a plea that echoes to this day : " people , i just want to say , can we all get along ? " he said			1
" can we get along ? " by the time it was over , 55 people were dead , more than 2,000 were hurt , and property damage exceeded $ 1 billion			0
nearly a year later , the four officers were tried in federal court on civil rights charges			0
this trial would be very different from the first : it took place in @entity8 , two african - americans were picked for the jury and @entity2 actually testified this time			1
" there was no way in the world that any jury would acquit all of the defendants again , " @entity106 , the defense attorney , told @entity0			1
@entity2 's own testimony may have hurt the federal case , as he hedged on whether police had used racial slurs during the beating			1
@entity2 recently told @entity0 that slurs definitely were uttered , but he said he vacillated on the stand because his mother had advised him to avoid talking about race			1
ultimately , @entity88 and @entity86 were found guilty , while @entity85 and @entity160 were acquitted			0
" it was like , ... i just hope we just get one			0
i hope we just get one on that , " @entity2 said			1
" if we get one , we 're good			0
so to get the two , i was really happy			0
" " we got half - justice , " his attorney , @entity80 , growled , but the verdicts and the 30 - month sentences seemed to satisfy the community			0
one more trial awaited : @entity2 's lawsuit against the city of @entity8			1
this time , there was only one @entity177 on the jury , and she was a force to be reckoned with			0
" half of them had no sympathy whatsoever , " @entity180 told @entity0 , referring to her fellow jurors			1
" they did not care at all			0
they just did n't care			0
like , ' he broke the law			0
he deserved what he got			0
' " " i told them they were crazy ! " she recalled			0
" it was about justice for what happened to him			0
no one deserves to get beat like that			0
" eventually , the other jurors came around , and @entity2 was awarded $ 3.8 million in damages			1
but the aftereffects continue to this day			0
@entity2 sometimes still wears a protective vest in response to a fear of reprisal and some genuine threats			1
and he 's had several more run - ins with the law , including a 90 - day jail stint in 1996 for a hit - and - run involving his wife at the time			2
2001 : @entity2 arrested three times in six weeks 2003 : @entity2 arrested after domestic dispute 2007 : @entity2 involved in shooting even on thursday , 20 years to the day after the beating , @entity2 had a minor run - in with police			1
people wonder why he kept getting into trouble			0
" the trouble that they see me in is a part of my life that i 'm working on , " he said , acknowledging a long - standing problem with alcohol			2
in 2008 , he appeared on @entity227 's " @entity228 " reality show			2
but despite those troubles -- not to mention frequent nightmares and the fact that he 's spent virtually all of his share of the $ 3.8 million -- @entity2 says he is happy			1
he 's a grandfather now , and he 's engaged to marry a special woman who has returned from his past -- @entity180			1
" she 's a nice , friendly person , " he said			2
things have changed at the @entity84 , too			0
the upper ranks are much more diverse			0
changes also have been made -- sometimes under court order -- in the way certain neighborhoods are patrolled and in how complaints are handled			0
" the main impact that the @entity2 case had is that it accelerated change , " journalist @entity243 said			1
" it 's not tenable any longer in the @entity11 for a police force of a major city to govern without having the community being a part of that governance			1
" whether society itself has sufficiently changed is a question for every generation to consider .			0

it has been 20 years since the police beating of @entity2
there were riots after none of the cops involved were *criminally* charged
today , @entity2 has moved on with his life : he 's a grandfather , and he 's engaged to a juror
