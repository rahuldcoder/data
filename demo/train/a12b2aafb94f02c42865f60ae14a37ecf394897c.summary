-- scientists are more convinced that human activity is behind the increase in global temperatures since the 1950s , which has boosted sea levels and the odds of extreme storms , according to a leaked draft of an upcoming @entity11 report			1
" it is extremely likely that human influence on climate caused more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 , " according to a summary of the draft obtained by @entity0			0
" there is high confidence that this has warmed the ocean , melted snow and ice , raised global mean sea level and changed some climate extremes in the second half of the 20th century			0
" those conclusions come from the upcoming report of the @entity30 , the fifth in a series of multiyear reports seen as a benchmark on the subject			1
the panel 's last report , in 2007 , concluded that it was 90 % certain that rising temperatures were due to human activity ; the new draft raises that figure to 95 %			1
climate change may increase violence , study shows the panel 's report is slated for release in sections , starting in september , and could be revised			1
but @entity49 , a research meteorologist at the @entity50 and the president of the @entity52 , said the report is expected " to strongly identify the significant human impact on the climate system			0
" " there are certainly some uncertainties that should be acknowledged , but the consensus is very clear that humans are playing a significant role , " said @entity49 , who contributed to the 2007 report but was not involved in compiling the upcoming document			1
increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other emissions have driven up global average temperatures by about 0.6 degrees c ( 1 degree f ) since 1950 , the report states			1
that 's likely to go up by between 1 and 3.7 degrees c ( 1.8 to 6.6 f ) by 2100 , the draft states			2
climate change sticker shock : @entity72 thaw could cost $ 60 trillion meanwhile , the rise of sea levels , currently about 3 mm ( 1/8 inch ) per year , is " very likely " to speed up			1
global average sea levels are expected to go up between 50 and 97 cm -- 20 inches to more than 3 feet -- by 2100 , according to the draft			1
" emissions at or above current rates would induce changes in all components in the climate system , some of which would very likely be unprecedented in hundreds to thousands of years , " it states			0
those changes are likely to occur " in all regions of the globe " and affect the water cycle , rising ocean acidity and changes in the water cycle			0
" many of these changes would persist for many centuries , " it added			0
opinion : @entity97 is right on climate change the effect has already been seen in shrinking summer icepacks in the @entity102 and warming permafrost in the @entity104 , it states			0
" it is very likely that the @entity72 sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin and that @entity104 snow cover will decrease during the 21st century as global temperature rises , " the draft states			2
the science of global warming is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most researchers , who point to heat - trapping carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels as the major cause			0
a may study of research papers published between 1991 and 2011 found that more than 97 % of those that expressed an opinion on the cause of increasing temperatures supported that consensus			1
skeptics point to the fact that the rate of warming has slowed since 1998 , a record warm year			0
but two more years , 2005 and 2010 , have topped that record -- and the report notes that each of the last three decades have been warmer than the last			0
meanwhile , the insurance industry and urban planners are treating sea - level rise as a real threat			2
a study published over the weekend in the scientific journal @entity140 warned that the world 's largest coastal cities will face tens of billions in flood losses a year even with improved defenses			2
the most vulnerable city on the list was the @entity148 city of @entity149 , with @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 rounding out the top five			0
@entity151 and much of @entity155 are still rebuilding from 2012 's catastrophic @entity156 , and a federal government report released monday said reconstruction should take into account " the existing and future threats exacerbated by climate change			2
" " more than ever , it is critical that when we build for the future , we do so in a way that makes communities more resilient to emerging challenges such as rising sea levels , extreme heat and more frequent and intense storms , " housing secretary @entity163 wrote in the report 's preface			1
@entity0 's @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .			2

sea levels are " very likely " to rise more *rapidly* , draft finds
an upcoming @entity11 report says scientific consensus is hardening
the report says it 's 95 % certain that humans are behind rising temperatures
the conclusions are *consistent* with those of other recent studies
