-- just when many colleges have started sending out their acceptances , director @entity4 's " admission , " a comedy set in a fictionalized @entity7 admissions office , has debuted in movie theaters across the country			1
the film is off to a so - so start at the box office , but its timing could not be better for drawing in high school seniors and their parents			1
@entity18 , in the role of @entity16 , an admissions officer with a screwball love life , gives us a lot to laugh at in " admission , " but as a college professor who has served on his school 's admissions committee , i found myself doing more squirming than laughing as i watched the film			1
what had me squirming was the focus of " admission , " @entity16 's efforts to gain entry into @entity7 for @entity31 , a brilliant student , who was a screwup at his local @entity34 high school but who has found himself at @entity36 , a nearby progressive , prep school			2
@entity31 is the classic diamond in the rough			0
he has gotten fives on all his advanced placement tests , despite never having taken an @entity42 course , and he is near 800 ( the top score ) on his @entity44			0
but @entity16 , whose motives for helping @entity31 are personal and professional , can not convince her fellow admissions officers that @entity31 is right for @entity7			1
after they vote to reject him , she takes matters into her own hands			0
in the middle of the night , she sneaks into the @entity7 admissions office and changes @entity31 's folder from deny to accept			2
the result is a blessing for @entity31 but the end of @entity16 's career in college admissions			1
what worried me -- and will , i assume , worry high school students and their parents -- is the film 's implication that the only way a diamond in the rough gets into a college such as @entity7 is through an admissions officer willing to sacrifice her best interests			1
my @entity72 undergraduate experience , as well as my current @entity74 experience , tells me that admissions officers are a lot smarter than " @entity28 " suggests			1
the admission officers i know find it easy to advocate for the student with great grades or the 220 - pound halfback who likes physics or the cellist who has played in the local symphony , but their eureka moment comes in discovering the promising student everyone else has ignored			2
still , i take the larger point of " admission " -- namely , these days getting into a prestigious college has become a blood sport			1
as @entity16 tells herself in the @entity96 novel on which " admission " is based , " the system as far as she was concerned was not about the applicant at all			2
it was about the institution			0
it was about delivering to the trustees , and to a lesser extent the faculty , a @entity104 of scholars , an olympiad of athletes , a conservatory of artists and musicians , a @entity111 of strivers			0
" colleges want students who will enhance their ratings and their brand , which means many worthy applicants get left behind			0
at the country 's most selective colleges and universities , only 3 percent of the students come from the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder			0
even worse , at all too many high schools , it is hard for aspiring students to get help on their college applications			2
a 2010 @entity130 study found that across the nation the ratio of high school students to guidance counselors was 460 to 1			0
what are good students and their parents supposed to do then ? here " @entity28 " provides no checklist of answers , but its satire on the workings of a fictionalized @entity7 ( last year the real @entity7 took in just 2,095 of the 26,664 who applied ) , provides solid , commonsense advice			0
" @entity28 " tells students and their parents that although the @entity145 of @entity146 offer a great education , those who obsess over gaining admission to them are , in most cases , headed for disappointment			0
they are letting themselves play a game in which there are certain to be more losers than winners			0
equally important , " admission " asserts that landing a spot in a prestigious college ( @entity16 is a @entity158 graduate ) does not guarantee a happy post-college life			1
indeed , if there is an overriding message in " admission , " it is : do n't lose perspective			1
the one truly shallow moment in the film comes when the director of @entity7 admissions complains to his staff that @entity171 has lowered @entity7 to no. 2 in its rankings			1
the director is deeply upset by the downgrade			0
he believes , as all too many parents and their children do in real life , that the quality of an education can be measured like a baseball batting average or the carats in a diamond ring			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			1

@entity185 : new film starring @entity18 *exaggerates* the plight of college admissions staff
he says admissions officers do n't have to go to *extraordinary* *lengths* to admit *unusual* applicant
film properly sends message not to lose perspective over college admissions , @entity197 says
@entity197 : landing a spot in a prestigious college does n't guarantee happiness in life
