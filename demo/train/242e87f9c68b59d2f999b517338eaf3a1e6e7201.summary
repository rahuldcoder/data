-- the recipe for bingsu , @entity4 's beloved shaved ice dessert , used to be simple			1
a little bowl of shaved ice , red beans boiled in sugar water , a little bit of condensed milk and maybe some fruit or ice cream heaped on top			1
that was before the @entity15 debuted the first so - called luxury bingsu three years ago , to spectacular sales and a frenzied following			1
competing @entity15 hotels promptly entered the fray with spoons blazing			1
with bingsu now at the top of every hotel restaurant 's summer agenda , the battle to come up with the most luxurious , inventive , delicious variation of the dessert has gotten more intense this year			1
here are the hotels that are currently winning the war			2
@entity15 this @entity30 luxury hotel started it all			1
in 2010 , the hotel dreamed up a sweet pumpkin bingsu , made with a base of dunggulle tea made from the dried root of @entity38 's seal , and an omija bingsu using shaved frozen berries			1
while most bingsu in @entity4 is made with frozen ice , the hotel debuted bingsu with a frozen milk base , and found that customers loved the change			1
they bought an expensive shaving machine in 2011 and also ordered traditional @entity50 pottery known to keep cold food insulated longer			0
@entity15 's bingsu fanatics promptly fell in love with the new menu			1
the hotel 's berry bingsu in particular came as a shock			2
@entity4 's best bars for summer the combination of blueberries , blackberries , raspberries , black currant compote with handmade dark chocolate , whipped cream , pistachios and mint created a completely new taste			2
the hotel became mobbed at meal times and on the weekends , and raked in several hundred thousand dollars of profit in a season , to the amazement -- and likely some envy -- of its competitors			0
since that memorable debut , the @entity77 has had to top its own bingsu menu each year			0
in 2012 , it introduced a peach bingsu and a chocolate bingsu			0
and this summer ? the @entity82 , made with pineapple , coconut chips , caramel sauce and macademia nuts , is new to the menu			0
another new addition is the @entity89			0
it 's made with mascarpone cream , espresso sauce , @entity93 , @entity95 cookies and almonds			0
despite the new dishes , the @entity97 remains the hotel 's most popular			0
@entity15 , 606 @entity100 , @entity30 , @entity15 ; +82 2 2016 1205 ; bingsu prices start at ₩ 33,000 ( $ 29 ) a bowl @entity103 the effort that the @entity103 has put into its bingsu menu has been extreme			1
since the beginning of the year , the hotel 's top chefs have created approximately 30 variations of the dessert , presenting a different version each week for tastings and deliberation			2
from this process , a final three bingsu have ended up on the menu			0
the @entity118 bingsu is made with shaved frozen pure coconut water from the @entity120 , mixed with coconut biscuits and coconut jelly , all made at the hotel			2
the @entity126 bingsu is dubbed the " 19 - plus " bingsu , for its alcoholic content ( 19 is the legal drinking age in @entity4 )			2
the sweet @entity129 is frozen , shaved , then blended with frozen mango shavings and fresh mangoes			0
10 best @entity50 restaurants in @entity15 when creating the latter bingsu , hotel chefs went through dozens of trials to capture the " sparkling " aspect of the wine in the actual bingsu			1
in order to make the perfect red bean paste , which can be ordered separately with each bingsu , a designated red bean chef has the arduous job of boiling the red bean until wrinkles form , then pouring cold water until the wrinkles are stretched out again , and repeating the process over and over until the perfect moist texture is reached			0
some of the hotel 's bingsu are sweetened with natural xylitol from @entity153			2

the lounge takes its bingsu ice seriously -- in order to recreate ice most similar to natural ice , a " maturing process " is used to make the ice " smoother			1
" chef @entity173 did the research for his recipe by visiting restaurants in @entity163 famous for their ice desserts			0
@entity179 's 50 best foods upon returning to @entity4 , he created green tea syrup using a maturing method at low temperatures , and also came up with the perfect red bean recipe by soaking the beans in water for a day , then boiling them for eight hours and adding three kinds of sugar at varying intervals			0
the result is the chewiest and shiniest red bean paste imaginable			0

the basic menu lists apple mango , persimmon , triple berry , affogato and milk bingsu that are all served with organic red bean sauce , ddeok ( sticky rice cakes ) and ice cream			2
the hotel uses shaved frozen milk as its bingsu base , somehow managing to make the shaved ice is as soft as cotton candy			1
each of the five bingsu has several layers of ingredients			0
it 's fun to eat layer by layer , but mixing it all vigorously is the @entity50 style and recommended			0

one commenter on the hotel 's website even left a note saying he could n't forget the taste of the dessert and was planning to visit @entity15 again for that specific reason			1
@entity253 popular since its 2011 debut , the apple mango bingsu has had customers literally lining up for bowls -- an unusual sight in the austere luxury hotel			1
" we use the highest quality apple mangoes from @entity262 and have opted to use a minimum amount of ingredients to keep the taste very clean and healthy , " says hotel a representative			0
the sought after bingsu will return with the @entity268 's reopening on august 1			2
