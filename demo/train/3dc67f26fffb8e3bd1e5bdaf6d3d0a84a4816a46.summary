-- there 's a devastating narrative being told about the pc these days : it 's dying			1
it 's not a slow death either			0
sales of traditional pcs are collapsing faster than anyone expected			0
and this is n't just some vague perception from the @entity13 crowd			0
this is backed up with real data , most notably in the latest @entity17 report released this month that says pc sales are down 14 % year over year			1
the entire market appears to be imploding , and it does n't just apply to pcs running @entity21			0
even @entity24 's @entity23 computer sales are basically flat year over year , yet its @entity26 business continues to grow			1
so what 's going on here ? why are n't people buying regular laptops and desktops anymore ? there are a ton of theories floating around out there , but the consensus seems to be that @entity3 makers still have n't figured out how to leverage the transition into mobile devices			2
perhaps the biggest blame falls on @entity40			2
it made a huge gamble with the introduction of @entity44 , a radically different kind of operating system designed primarly for touchscreen devices			2
@entity21 8 replaces your traditional desktop screen with a new touch - friendly start menu that has a lot of people confused			1
@entity17 's report sums it up nicely : " while some consumers appreciate the new form factors and touch capabilities of @entity44 , the radical changes to the @entity54 , removal of the familiar @entity57 button , and the costs associated with touch have made pcs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices			1
@entity40 will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the pc market			2
" it 's as if @entity40 is eating itself , trying to catch up with the mobile revolution while still packaging its new operating system in pricey hardware that 's clearly declining in popularity with consumers			1
and because @entity44 tablets are full pcs with expensive components , people are moving to cheaper tablets like the @entity80 or ones based on @entity84 's @entity83 operating system			1
after all , why buy a brand new expensive computer that 's difficult to learn when you can get an easy - to - use tablet that can do most of the same stuff at a fraction of the price ? however , there is a small ray of hope for the @entity40 faithful			1
@entity40 is gearing up to release a new version of @entity21 later this year , codenamed @entity96			1
according to several reports , @entity96 will give users the option to replace the new start screen with a traditional desktop by default			1
if the reports are true , it would be a smart move , and one that could help ease the transition into modern mobile computing			0
the company is also toying around with the idea of making smaller , cheaper tablets that are much more popular with consumers			1
@entity40 recently issued a statement to its manufacturing partners that @entity44 will now support smaller screens in the 7 - inch range			1
plus there are several reports that @entity40 will add such a tiny tablet to its surface line of devices			2
you can expect to see a bunch of similar devices from other manufacturers later this year			0
let 's be clear though			0
this game is n't over yet			0
@entity40 and @entity84 have n't either			0
the personal computing industry has been turned on its head , and everyone is still noodling around with strategies on how to adapt			0
even the way we define " pc " is changing , and we 're getting to the point where there 's almost no distinction between mobile and regular computing			2
the pc as we know it may be dying , but the pc as it will be is just getting started			0

@entity40 's mobile - friendly @entity44 has confused some users
but company is working on " @entity96 , " that 's reportedly more desktop friendly
