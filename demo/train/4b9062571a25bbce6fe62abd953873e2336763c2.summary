improving views of the economy have helped hike president @entity6 's approval rating to a 20 - month high , a new @entity2 / @entity1 poll showed tuesday , as markets climbed to record levels at news of an economy in overdrive			1
more @entity12 still disapprove of the job @entity6 is doing as president			1
but at 48 % , @entity6 's approval rating is at its highest point in @entity2 polling since may 2013			1
the gains were driven by newfound backing among women , independents and millennials — groups where @entity6 's approval numbers jumped 10 percentage points from a month ago			1

the approval jump follows a late - quarter jolt in @entity6 's governing agenda , which gained momentum after unilateral actions on immigration and relations with @entity35			1
separate surveys have showed those moves popular among the @entity12 people			0
it all amounts to some welcome good news for @entity6 , whose unpopularity — despite consistently improving economic conditions — led to widespread losses for his party in november 's midterm elections			2
tuesday 's poll still reflected pervasive disaffection for @entity6 : 56 % of respondents said the president has fallen short of their expectations , and 49 % said his policies would take the country in the wrong direction			2
the steady economic recovery has posed a conundrum for the @entity57 , which wants some credit for decisions that helped pull the country from last decade 's recession			0
to the frustration of @entity6 and his aides , polls until recently showed @entity12 largely pessimistic about the country 's financial state , despite solid job growth and a bull market on @entity69			1
in public remarks — even those unrelated to the economy — @entity6 has touted the latest positive economic sign			2
but even as the unemployment rate dipped below 6 % , a large portion of @entity12 were still gloomy about the economy			2
that 's because of how people felt about their own economic standing , which for many still includes stagnant wages or jobs in low - paying service fields			0
but as the recovery powers on , and the days of the downturn fade further into the past , @entity12 appear to have turned the page in their views of the economy			2
tuesday 's @entity2 / @entity1 poll showed for the first time in seven years , a majority of @entity12 — 51 % — have a positive view of the economy , a sharp increase from the 38 % who felt that way in october			1
the jump was present in every demographic group — men , women , whites , non-whites , urban , rural — and was largest among @entity12 who earn less than $ 50,000 annually			0
@entity12 ' increasingly positive economic views parallel a drop in gas prices — a phenomenon most experts say a president has little control over			0
and they come as new data show the @entity12 economy growing at a surging rate			0
the @entity112 said tuesday that gross domestic product grew at 5 % in the third quarter — its fastest pace in more than a decade			0
stocks rose sharply , with the @entity116 topping 18,000 for the first time ever and the @entity118 500 also reaching new heights			0
