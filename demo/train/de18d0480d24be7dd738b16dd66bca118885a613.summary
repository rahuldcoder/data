timeline of @entity10 protests in @entity4 the advocacy group said it had taken 10 days to confirm his self - immolation , which took place february 3 , " because @entity3 are too frightened of @entity4 state reprisals to speak about protests			1
" independently verifying the reported self - immolations inside @entity4 is often difficult because of restrictions on reporting from the restive areas and the reluctance of local officials to comment on the accounts provided by foreign groups such as @entity17			1

but @entity10 refugees in @entity96 have claimed the @entity4 government officials are pressuring their @entity96 counterparts to make the country less hospitable to @entity3			1
