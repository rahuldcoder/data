@entity0 -- it 's the biggest storyline heading into next year 's midterm elections : will @entity4 succeed in taking control of the @entity6 ? @entity4 argue that an announcement over the weekend vastly improves their chances			1
the news from @entity12 's former @entity9 gov. @entity11			1
the man known for his signature bolo tie said he would not run for @entity6 next year , as many @entity9 had expected			1
@entity11 captured nearly two - thirds of the vote in his 2008 re-election as governor of the red state and was seen by many as the best chance for the party to keep the seat of retiring sen. @entity25 blue			1
@entity11 has recently faced potentially damaging stories about his ties to a political nonprofit group and its disclosure practices			1
but sources said that may have just been the tip of the iceberg when it came to opposition research @entity11 may have faced had he decided to launch a @entity6 bid			1
but @entity11 denied that impacted his decision			2
" this is n't my first rodeo , " he told @entity38			0
@entity11 wo n't run for @entity6 in 2014 a @entity4 source said @entity11 's decision is a " sea change in the 2014 atmosphere			1
" " winning the majority is something we 've always thought not only possible , but our mission and bar for success , yet many others remained skeptical -- particularly donors and the pundit class , " said the source , who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely			0
" this development starts to break through that wall and crumple the belief that a @entity4 majority is out of reach			0
" next year , the @entity9 will try to maintain their majority in the @entity6 , where they currently hold a 54 - 46 edge ( including two independents who caucus with the party ) over the @entity4			2
they hope to expand that to 55 - 45 following october 's special @entity6 election in @entity66 , which they are favored to win			2
but they most likely will be defending 21 of 35 seats up for grabs in november 2014			1
besides @entity12 , @entity4 are also optimistic about capturing seats in two other states that vote red in presidential elections : neighboring @entity73 , where @entity9 sen. @entity74 is not running for re-election ; and @entity76 , where @entity9 sen. @entity77 is retiring			2
if the @entity4 captures @entity12 , @entity73 , and @entity76 , it only needs three more seats to reach the magic number of 51			0
@entity4 eyes are focused on four @entity9 facing tough battles next year : @entity83 of @entity84 , @entity85 of @entity86 , @entity87 of @entity88 , and @entity89 of @entity90			0
take three of those four races and the @entity4 will do what they could n't do in 2010 and 2012 : win back the majority			0
" we are in a strong position not only to win in @entity12 , but national pundits are now beginning to recognize something that we 've been saying since february : republicans are positioned to win the @entity6 majority in 2014 , " @entity99 spokesman @entity98 said in an e-mail on monday			1
@entity104 deputy executive director @entity103 disagrees			0
" republicans have been feeling good about their chances in the @entity6 for six years and they 're still in the minority , " @entity103 told @entity1			1
" the math still strongly favors @entity9 and so does history			0
@entity9 incumbent senators are very tough to beat			0
only three @entity9 incumbents have lost re-election in a decade			0
" sources say that recent stories about @entity11 were just the tip of the iceberg when it came to opposition research he might have faced if he had launched a @entity6 bid			1
" democrats and @entity4 agree on @entity11 : there was a treasure trove of opposition research			1
it 's highly unlikely that his candidacy would have been successful , " said a @entity9 source who asked for anonymity in order to speak more candidly			0
" now we have a list of prospects , and while there 's no question that they begin as underdogs in a red state , @entity9 are better off with a candidate that can win rather than a candidate that would self - combust before the 2014 elections			1
" but @entity11 had statewide name recognition that no other @entity143 may be able to match , said @entity144 , political editor of the non-partisan @entity145			1
" republicans have a narrow path to the @entity6 majority in 2014 , but it got a little wider when @entity11 decided not to run , " @entity144 said			1
" we still do n't know who the candidates will be , but @entity11 was a proven vote - getter with nearly universal name identification			2
no @entity143 will start from the same place he would have			0
democrats can win in @entity4 - leaning states , but it takes someone with proven independence from the national party			0
we 'll see if @entity9 can find that candidate			0
" democrats are also defending retirements in @entity162 , where sen. @entity163 is not running for a sixth term , and @entity165 , where sen. @entity166 is not bidding for a seventh term			2
as of now , both of those seats appear to be safer for the @entity9			0
the two @entity4 retirements are in states that appear to be safe for the @entity4 : sen. @entity172 of @entity173 and sen. @entity174 of @entity175 , although @entity9 think an ugly primary in @entity175 could lead to a very conservative nominee who would be beatable in the general election			0
the only other seat @entity9 hope to put in play is in @entity181 , where @entity6 minority leader @entity182 , who 's running for a sixth - term , is facing a challenge from @entity9 secretary of state @entity184 .			2

former democratic *montana* gov. @entity11 decides he wo n't run for @entity6
@entity11 was a favorite because of name recognition and electoral success in red state
recent reports have tied @entity11 to nonprofit group with questions about practices
democrats are defending far more @entity6 seats in 2014 than republicans
