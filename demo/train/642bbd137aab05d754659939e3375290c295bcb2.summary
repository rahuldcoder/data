announcing @entity5 as this year 's recipient of the @entity7 , @entity2 - @entity1 president @entity0 saluted her as " a tremendously talented performer with a diverse body of screen and stage work , live performances and several hit records			1
" but that 's something of an understatement			1
@entity5 , 82 , has been performing since age 16 , when she won the title of miss @entity18			1
that led to a contract at @entity22 , where she spent two years before she was scooped up by @entity24 , the mecca of musicals			1
read more @entity2 : @entity5 to receive @entity27 what was your reaction when you learned you 'd been chosen to receive @entity2 's @entity7 ? @entity0 called and told me i was picked for the award			1
it was a surprise to me — i was amazed and am delighted to receive it			1
the last recipient was @entity36 , who 's an old friend of mine from our @entity24 days — we were under contract at the same time			1
it 's special because it 's from my peers — people who have talent and know what you do — so i 'm looking forward to it ! i 've asked my daughter , @entity47 [ @entity48 ] , to present it to me , and we 're bringing the whole family , so it will be a family affair ! looking back , what was your big break ? i loved @entity55 and @entity56 and all the musicals , and i came into the business after entering the miss @entity18 contest , doing a @entity55 imitation and winning the prize , which led to a studio contract and the beginning of my career			1
which of your films do you feel proudest of ? " @entity76 " was my favorite role and the best part that i had to play , as was " mother , " a wonderful @entity73 movie that he wrote a great screenplay for			1
i also loved " @entity83 , " " @entity82 " with @entity84 , " @entity85 " with @entity86 — and i had great fun working on " @entity78 " with @entity79 , who i thought was a wonderful man			1
but the greatest movie that i was a part of was " @entity88			1
" i was very fortunate that [ producer ] @entity90 took a young girl who had no training at all — did n't dance , did n't sing , did n't do anything — and gave her a chance to be in that film			1
and then i had to prove myself ! i owe a lot to him and [ @entity24 executives ] @entity101 — mr. @entity101 — and @entity102 and @entity103			1
it was the era when they would take an unknown girl and make a star of her overnight			1
@entity108 was very good to me			2
read more @entity48 to present mother @entity5 with @entity109 what was it like to work at @entity24 in its heyday ? they ran it like a university might be run			1
they had one floor of producers , one floor of directors , one floor of writers			2
and another building were all the editors			2
and everybody had students under them , learning the business			2
so there were always the top writers , and then there were the younger writers , and they were being taught by the older writers , and everybody kind of shared ideas			2
you had your drama teacher , then you had your voice teacher ; you learned how to interpret classical and regular lyrics , then you had your music department — @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , all these great musicians and writers and lyricists and arrangers			2
is it true that , while working with @entity148 on " @entity88 , " you were being tutored by @entity149 ? yes , it 's true			1
he was working on the soundstage next door to us , and he kept encouraging me not to be discouraged , not to cry , to keep practicing and to believe that i could do it			2
he would let me watch him rehearse — he never let anyone watch him rehearse — so i could see how hard it was , no matter how great your natural talent			2
you were , until recently , a great collector of movie memorabilia			2
what do you think of the @entity165 's plan for its own museum of @entity167 ? the biggest fan of all time is me			2
anyone who 's a fan wants to touch an object held by their favorite star			1
we should have had a museum many , many years ago			2
it 's much too late			0
we 're behind on it			0
but i 'm excited and looking forward to it			0
read more @entity179 [ 4 ] how did you feel about your daughter following you into the business ? and now returning to the @entity184 franchise ? @entity185 is a great producer , and i 'm very grateful to him for giving my daughter an opportunity to play a great part			0
my first [ big ] role was " @entity192 ' in the rain , " and my daughter 's first [ big ] role was " @entity184			1
" i had one bun for a hairdo , and @entity47 had two buns ! she just finished the new " @entity184 " — and my granddaughter , @entity197 , is playing a role in it , too ! it 's very exciting to see my granddaughter jumping into the fray also			1
if director @entity205 had asked you to play a cameo in the new " @entity184 " with your daughter and granddaughter , what would you have said ? i would have said yes ! it would have been great fun			0
i 'm not sure they would have agreed ; in fact , they must not have , because they did n't invite me in			0
otherwise i would have been there			0
are you still traveling and performing a lot ? i was until just this last february , when i closed in @entity218			0
i 'm going to cut way back now			0
i have never taken any time off — no vacation ever in 66 years — so i 'm going to take off			0
i have n't been feeling really well the last two years , so i 've decided that @entity108 is giving me a sign : " take it easy , kid ! " and i 'm going to do just that			0
read more @entity2 : ' birdman , ' ' @entity224 [ 5 ] so do you now consider yourself to be retired or just on hiatus ? hiatus			0
it 's the ham in me — i love to sing and dance			0
i watch @entity229 every night — what would i do without @entity229 ? i would really be lost and unhappy without them ! and i like new movies — i liked " @entity233			0
" the parts are so different			0
i was in musicals and comedies , mostly ; the young actors today have more dramatic films , fuller roles to play than i had the opportunity to do			0
i enjoy watching all of them			0
if @entity148 had a theme song , it probably was " @entity244 ' in the rain			0
" what would yours be ? " @entity247 n't done yet			0
" ( sings the song			0
) also the songs from " @entity76 " and " @entity88 " — maybe " @entity249			1
" ( sings that song as well			0
