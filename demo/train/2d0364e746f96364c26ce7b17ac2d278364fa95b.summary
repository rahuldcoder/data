-- witnessing the gruesome devastation of @entity2 in @entity3 in august 1945 -- 68 years ago this week -- the physicists who worked on the @entity5 were aghast at the scale of damage their work had wrought			1
both cities were obliterated and several tens of thousands of people died instantly			2
soon after those atom bombs were dropped , the press , with information scarce , chased after an @entity16 physicist who was instrumental in discovering nuclear fission , then working as an exile in @entity19			1
she was @entity21 , and they anointed her the " @entity24 mother of the bomb			1
" this was far from the truth			0
she was so opposed to using fission to create an atom bomb that when offered the opportunity to work on the @entity5 , she flatly refused			1
her refusal arose from a strong revulsion : " i will have nothing to do with a bomb			2
" @entity36 , as she was , she foresaw the power of fission to unleash untold damage and suffering			0
still , the myth persisted			0
@entity21 was born into an enlightened @entity24 family			1
unusually for the time , her father strongly supported her education and interest in physics			0
with a doctorate in physics from the @entity48 in 1906 , she studied under @entity49 and went on to work with @entity50 in @entity51			0
in may 1938 , working at the @entity52 in @entity51 , @entity21 , @entity53 and @entity54 discovered that the uranium atom could be split when bombarded by neutrons			1
they expected this to produce new elements heavier than uranium			0
at this critical juncture in their work , @entity21 had to flee @entity65 's @entity64 , and her participation in the scientific collaboration was cut short			1
she ended up in @entity19			0
later that year , @entity53 and @entity69 found a puzzling development and shared it with her -- instead of finding a heavier nucleus as one of the byproducts of fission , they detected a lighter one : barium			0
@entity21 and her physicist nephew , @entity77 , solved the puzzle by figuring out that the radioactive decay of one of the unstable products of fission had produced stable barium			1
@entity21 's work , along with that of @entity53 and @entity69 , laid the groundwork for the nuclear bomb			1
but it was @entity89 and his research group in @entity91 in 1942 that made the bomb a reality , by setting up a self - sustaining chain reaction			0
but soon after @entity97 and @entity98 were flattened , the international media hounded @entity21 with questions			1
the newspaper @entity100 ran an article headlined " fleeing jewess , " which described her escape from @entity64 with the secret of the bomb and its handover to the @entity106			0
according to @entity21 's recent biographer , @entity110 , the @entity109 myth started with an article written in 1940 for the @entity113 by @entity114 , the official chronicler of the @entity117 project			2
his dramatic piece read like a juicy spy novel -- from the genesis of the idea of fission , to @entity21 's escape from @entity64 , to her sharing her work with her nephew @entity77 , in @entity127			1
@entity77 supposedly cabled it to @entity129 , who in turn passed it on to scientists in @entity133			0
suddenly , the unverified 1940 story turned @entity21 into the " @entity24 mother of the bomb			1
" not only did she not work on the bomb , she had converted in 1906 to @entity138			2
the stories upset her greatly , and she set the record straight during her visit to the @entity133 in 1946			0
speaking to @entity142 of the @entity143 , she stressed her support for the peaceful uses of atomic energy			0
while journalists gave her a starring role in the bomb , she was not credited with the scientific discovery of fission by the @entity152 , which awarded the prize to @entity53 alone , in chemistry			1
debate has continued on whether she was yet another of those invisible women who should have won a @entity152			2
she finally received recognition when president @entity158 awarded her , @entity53 and @entity69 the @entity159 in 1966 , and the element with atomic number 109 was named @entity162 in her honor in 1997			0
when i met the wife of her nephew @entity77 at a dinner in @entity168 10 years ago , she talked lovingly of @entity169 the person and told me that her epitaph read , appropriately , " @entity21 : a physicist who never lost her humanity			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			2

@entity176 : atom bombs obliterated @entity98 and @entity97 in august 1945
@entity180 : afterward , fission *pioneer* @entity181 *falsely* *dubbed* " @entity183 "
her work laid the foundation , but she was *firmly* opposed to it being used for destruction
@entity190 gave @entity21 a major role in the bomb , but she was overlooked for a @entity152
