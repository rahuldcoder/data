-- once again , it was all about " @entity2 " at the box office , as three new releases failed to even approach the @entity7 superhero blockbuster 's third - weekend gross of $ 55.1 million , according to studio estimates			1
the movie dropped 47 percent -- an admirable hold for a picture that 's putting up such huge numbers			0
by the end of sunday , " @entity2 " will have made an estimated $ 457.1 million domestically , passing $ 450 million in a record 17 days			1
( the previous record holder , " @entity16 , " reached that milestone in 27 days			0
) meanwhile , " @entity2 " also passed " @entity18 : @entity19 " to become @entity21 's biggest movie ever both domestically and worldwide			1
it now sits in fourth place on the all - time worldwide chart , behind only " @entity25 , " " @entity26 , " and " @entity27 and the @entity28 -- part 2			0
" " @entity2 ' " continued dominance meant fewer moviegoers for " @entity32 , " which sunk on arrival with only $ 25.3 million			1
that 's the worst domestic opening ever for a movie with a reported budget of at least $ 200 million			1
( @entity37 spent $ 209 million on the @entity39 picture			1
) it 's also a smaller debut than this year 's other notorious flop , " @entity42 , " which started out with $ 30.2 million			1
to the dismay of @entity46 fans everywhere , @entity43 has now starred in two of the year 's biggest bombs			0
" @entity32 " has so far earned $ 226.8 million overseas , which will help to lessen the damage from the movie 's dismal opening here			1
also , @entity37 will clearly be hoping that the upcoming @entity54 holiday weekend will soften the film 's second - weekend decline			0
still , no matter how you look at it , @entity32 's performance is a major disappointment			0
moviegoers were n't able to get past the idea of a seeing a board - game adaptation crossed with an alien - invasion flick , although those who did see it gave it an okay " b " rating according to the market - research firm @entity67			2
" @entity32 " struggled to attract younger moviegoers , as 55 percent of its audience was at least 30 years old			2
men represented 57 percent of ticket buyers			0
in third place , " @entity75 " collected a decent $ 17.4 million for a five - day tally of $ 24.5 million			1
( the movie opened on wednesday			0
) the result is a bit of a setback for star @entity80 , whose prior comedies " @entity82 " and " @entity83 " debuted to $ 26.5 million and $ 30.6 million , respectively			1
now the question is whether the @entity86 movie will fall at the same velocity as " @entity83 , " which ultimately ended its domestic run with just $ 60.1 million			1
both " @entity75 " and " @entity83 " earned a poor " c " grade from @entity67 audiences , which is n't a promising sign			2
however , whereas " @entity83 " dropped an alarming 39 percent from friday to saturday , " the dictator " managed to rise 16 percent			0
the movie cost $ 65 million to produce and drew a young , male crowd -- 65 percent of the audience was male , and 56 percent was under the age of 25			2
overseas , " @entity75 " fared well for an r - rated comedy , earning $ 30.3 million in 29 markets and topping the weekend in @entity100 and a number of @entity103 territories , including the @entity104 and @entity105			1
the weekend 's other new comedy , @entity108 's pregnancy - themed " what to expect when you 're expecting , " debuted to an underwhelming $ 10.5 million			2
the @entity39 movie , which cost $ 40 million and features an ensemble including @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117 , attracted a crowd that was 70 percent female and 64 percent over the age of 25			2
@entity67 participants gave it a lackluster " b - " rating			0
among holdovers , the @entity123 film " @entity124 " plunged a steep 57 percent for $ 12.8 million			2
the $ 125 million horror comedy , starring @entity127 as an out - of - his - time vampire , has so far drained $ 50.9 million domestically and $ 81.3 million overseas			2
in limited release , the sports drama " @entity132 , " starring " @entity129 ' " @entity133 as the coach of a @entity136 lacrosse team , scored a surprisingly solid $ 280,000 from 55 theaters			0
the @entity104 geriatric comedy " @entity139 " continued to excel in limited release , grossing $ 3.3 million from 178 locations			1
the movie jumped 22 percent this weekend even though it did n't add any additional theaters			0
however , another @entity104 comedy , @entity144 , debuted to only $ 40,800 at five theaters			0
" @entity2 " -- $ 55.1 mil 2			1
