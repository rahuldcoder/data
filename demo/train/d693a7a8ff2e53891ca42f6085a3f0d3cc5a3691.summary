-- an advisory panel to the @entity2 has recommended that devices used in electroconvulsive therapy ? also known as " electroshock therapy " ? should continue to be classified as high risk			1
the devices , which induce a seizure by delivering an electrical current to a patient 's brain , are used to treat intractable cases of depression , as well as bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , and other mental disorders			2
on friday , a majority of experts on the panel expressed support for classifying @entity22 devices as high risk for the treatment of depression and several other conditions			1
although the panel members " weighed in , " no formal vote was taken and none is expected , according to @entity2 spokesperson @entity28			0
@entity2 mulls future of electroshock therapy if the @entity2 follows the panel 's advice , as it usually does , the makers of @entity22 devices may need to provide the agency with additional safety and efficacy evidence , like that required for prescription drugs			1
@entity22 machines are currently in a high - risk category but have so far avoided the cumbersome @entity2 approval process thanks to a grandfather clause			1
proponents of @entity22 were dismayed by the panel 's assessment			2
just two small companies in the @entity49 make @entity22 devices , and some experts worry that neither will have the resources to conduct the studies that the @entity2 may require , which could ultimately restrict access to the treatment			1
" it 's going to be very unfortunate , " says @entity56 , @entity57 , a professor of psychiatry at @entity59			0
" it 's going to disappear out of our practices			0
there are 100,000 people who undergo @entity22 in the @entity49 , and it wo n't be available to them			0
" @entity0 : 10 myths about shock therapy one of the device manufacturers , the @entity70 - based company somatics , declined to comment			0
@entity71 , the legal director of @entity72 , in @entity73 , @entity74 , one of many patient advocacy groups that argued for stricter oversight of @entity22 devices in the lead - up to last week 's meeting , says her organization was " pleased " with the outcome			1
" we agree that the manufacturers of @entity22 devices should have to go through the [ pre-market approval ] process to show they are clinically safe and effective , " @entity71 says			2
" we hope the @entity2 takes the committee 's advice			0
" @entity0 : what @entity22 feels like the @entity2 's official decision will not be made for at least a year , and doctors can continue to use @entity22 devices in the interim			1
even if the agency requires manufacturers to seek approval for their products , the devices will remain in use during the approval process , @entity91 says			0
" we 're optimistic that this life - saving procedure will continue to be available as a treatment option for patients with debilitating illnesses , " the president of the @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity57 , said in a statement			0
the association supports reclassifying @entity22 devices as medium risk , which would preclude the need for additional research regarding their safety and effectiveness			2
