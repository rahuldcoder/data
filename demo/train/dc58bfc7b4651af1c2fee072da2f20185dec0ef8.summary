-- we are often asked to declare our identity for documents , applications , bank loans and even social networking sites			2
but how much of our identity is lost when we select " female , " " @entity9 " or " @entity10 ? " i think much of my own identity is lost when i fill in those boxes			2
i am technically a white , male , heterosexual , @entity15 , upper - class ph.d. student			1
but i am more than meets the eye			0
i 'm covered in tattoos and piercings , and this often leads to assumptions about my character			1
" is he a drug addict ? is he a skinhead ? does he play music for a band ? " i am none of these things			0
the lesson i hope to teach others through my life is that it 's important to see past appearances			1
my sociopolitical views are a large part of my identity , and i incorporate these into what i wear ; whether it 's t - shirts emblazoned with the images of activists whom i admire or deliberately manipulating my demeanor to reflect the " professorial " role i assume in the classroom , i am continually aware that others are reading my presentation as a measure of my character			1
and it is to this end that i deliberately try to throw people off			0
i hope to debunk some of the myths surrounding tattoos and piercings			1
and i know that everyone who interacts with me is left wondering how someone so " deviant - looking " can be kind , courteous and hospitable			0
my body is also a billboard for my life , and my tattoos tell the story of my identity			1
my earliest tattoos were direct quotes and @entity64 verses and captured my identity as an outspoken social - justice advocate			1
i began to display my political views more directly in later tattoos			1
i have the " female " sign behind my left ear to reflect my commitment to feminism and women everywhere ; i have the @entity74 logo behind my right ear to reflect my commitment to @entity78 struggles			0
the tattoos on my arms capture my commitment to " faith , " " family " and " mom and dad			2
" i also have a bald eagle on my forearm to reflect my commitment to making this country a better place and a skull wearing a graduation cap to reflect my lifelong commitment to teaching			0
i know that my appearance is misleading , and i know that many people would disagree with what i see as efficacious inscriptions			0
but one thing is for certain : i will not blend in with the crowd			0
i will be noticed , for better or worse			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity103 .			2

@entity105 is technically a white , male , heterosexual , @entity106 student
@entity103 : my tattoos and piercings lead to assumptions about my character
sociopolitical views are a large part of identity , and tattoos tell story , he says
" i hope to teach others *...* it 's important to see past appearances "
