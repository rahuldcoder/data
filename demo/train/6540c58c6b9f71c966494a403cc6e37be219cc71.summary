@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the picturesque temple town of @entity0 , 10 - year - old @entity4 and her three siblings walk to school every day on an empty stomach			1
she says her parents ca n't afford to feed them adequate meals ; they eat bread and milk for dinner and nothing for breakfast			1
as the eldest child , she often has to skip class to help her parents harvest wheat			0
@entity4 says her parents believe this is a more efficient use of her time , but she has another good reason for attending school -- more food			0
" at school we get the most amount of food			0
at home we do n't get this much			0
at home my mother tells us to only eat a little bit so there 's enough for everyone , " she says			0
following a landmark decision by the @entity37 in 2001 , all government schools in @entity1 are mandated to provide free meals to students below the age of 13			1
in a country where more than 40 % of children below the age of five are underweight , according to @entity46 , @entity1 's midday meal scheme is making great strides			1
the @entity48 is working with the government to feed 1.4 million underprivileged children every day			1
they began in 2000 , feeding a few thousand school children in several schools in the southern city of @entity55			1

@entity48 's vice chairman , @entity61 , says the benefits are manifold			1
enrollment in schools has increased by roughly 20 % , attendance has improved , children are healthier and their cognitive abilities have also increased			1

but preparing food for so many takes more than an ordinary kitchen			2
you could call it a culinary revolution			0
in what looks like a factory for food , fresh meals are being mass - produced for millions of children			1
custom - made cauldrons can prepare rice for 1,000 kids in 15 minutes			1
a printing press - like machine can make an impressive 40,000 @entity1 flatbreads or chapattis in an hour			1
" @entity1 is a place of numbers			2
if you 're doing something to provide meals for 1,000 or even 5,000 children , you are merely scratching the surface , " adds @entity61			2

" we want to treat these children with dignity			0
we do n't say ' you are poor children and whatever we give you , you must eat that , ' no. we adapt our cooking methods , our menus , recipes to meet the local children 's requirements , " says @entity61			2
" you see , in @entity1 every 300 miles you come across a different culture , a different language , a different kind of food habit , so at @entity48 we are sensitive to local cultural requirements and tastes			1
" while there are several school feeding programs that distribute rations of wheat and rice , cooked meal programs are rare			0
