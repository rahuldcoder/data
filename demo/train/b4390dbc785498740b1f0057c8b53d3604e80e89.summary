-- [ warning : the following contains spoilers for the " @entity5 " season finale			1
] permission to squee ? saturday night 's " @entity5 " season finale was a roller coaster of feels , with deaths , goodbyes and one incredible @entity11 move by the doctor			1
it was the end of the first season of @entity15 as the @entity16			1
here are five moments that had us cheering or reaching for the tissues : 1			1
the master kills @entity21 this one really hurt			1
unit captured the master and made the doctor the president of @entity26 , as they faced a massive invasion by dead - people - turned - @entity29			1
the master tried the old talking - to - your - captor trick to bowtie - wearing geek @entity21 ( " bowties are cool , " after all ) , telling @entity21 that she was about to be killed within 60 seconds			1
unfortunately for @entity21 , the master was no longer handcuffed and made good on her promise			1
it was part of a terrific nutso performance by @entity40 , but we 'll really miss @entity21 , who was like the ultimate " @entity5 " fan			1
windsurfing into the tardis the plane that carried the doctor and members of @entity47 exploded , and the doctor was sent flying out of it , about to crash to the ground			1
was this how it would all end ? instead , the doctor spotted the tardis and aimed himself to land right inside it			2
wow ! the master 's @entity57 interface assistant @entity56 was quite impressed by this , but the @entity58 destroyed him as he squeed			2
@entity60 reunites with @entity61 after talking her way out of being killed by the @entity29 by impersonating the doctor , @entity60 found herself in a graveyard , and discovered that an approaching @entity29 was her late boyfriend , @entity61 , who still had emotions , but was begging her to switch them off			2
the doctor arrived in time to tell her not to do it , but the master did as well			2
after a heart - wrenching exchange among all of them , @entity61 and @entity60 said one last goodbye , as @entity60 took his sonic screwdriver and aimed it right at him , making him emotionless			2
however , he was able to take control of the @entity29 and fly them away , blowing themselves up and foiling the master 's plan			2
@entity83 's father kills the master @entity60 was determined to kill the master , but she turned over the master 's vaporizing remote control over to the doctor , but then the master was vaporized by someone else : the @entity29 version of the doctor 's old friend , unit 's @entity92			2
@entity60 's goodbye two weeks later , when @entity60 ( @entity96 ) was awakened by a portal from the afterlife , she heard from @entity61 , who sacrificed his one chance to return to life by returning the young boy he had accidentally killed while he was a soldier			0
@entity60 and the doctor later met at a restaurant , where she broke the news to him that she could n't travel with him any longer			0
he assumed it was because she was back together with @entity61 , and she would n't tell him otherwise			0
the doctor had news for her as well : the master gave him the coordinates for @entity110 and he found it			0
but we saw the reality : it was n't there , and the doctor destroyed the @entity117 ' control panel in frustration			0
@entity60 hugged the doctor , something he never likes doing , and told him , " doctor , traveling with you made me feel really special			0
thank you for making me feel special			0
" he thanked her for the same			0
do n't mind us , we 've got something in our eye			0
@entity15 's message to grieving boy but it was n't over : the doctor got a visit from @entity133 , played by @entity134			1
what does the @entity137 special hold for us ? fans on @entity139 had a lot to say about this finale , and they had mixed feelings			1
" it 's one of @entity146 's trickiest finales ever , " tweeted @entity143			0
" while he wrapped up @entity148 in a pleasing way , i felt something big was missing			0
" " i have so many feels right now , " said @ @entity151			0
" loved it ! ca n't wait for , ca n't believe i 'm saying it ... @entity137 ! " @entity155 summed it up as " a thrilling conclusion to an uneven season that showed the strengths and weaknesses of producer @entity146 's fairytale approach			1
