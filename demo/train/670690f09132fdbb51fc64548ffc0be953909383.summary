-- it was a strange sight indeed -- one large aircraft carrying another large aircraft strapped on top			1
but that 's exactly what skyward - looking folks in @entity7 saw tuesday as @entity9 , atop a @entity10 747 , made an inspiring pass over the capital in its final flight			1
it makes you wonder : how can the 747 transport something that big and heavy ? well , the shuttle - airliner combo is not as heavy as you might first think			1
in fact , it 's a relatively easy load to hoist			2
when the shuttle missions started in the 1980s , @entity20 designated several places as landing strips for the orbiter , including @entity25 in @entity26			0
discovery taken its final destination , a @entity30 museum but all the launches were from @entity32 , so @entity20 needed a way to transport to @entity34 from @entity25			0
a shuttle ca n't fly itself after it leaves orbit , as it is basically a big glider			0
so @entity20 created the designed the @entity37 , which is a @entity10 747 designed to fly with a shuttle on top			1
all that 's well - known , at least to space buffs			0
but what may surprise many people is that a @entity10 747 with a space shuttle strapped on its roof weighs less -- that 's right , less -- than a 747 airliner full of passengers			1
at first that might seem counterintuitive , but @entity50 , a spokeswoman for @entity20 , says the 747 they use is stripped clean of anything in the main cabin			2
there 's a cockpit and a big empty shell			0
but the 747s used by airlines have hundreds of seats , galleys , lavatories -- even a bar in some cases			0
add 300 - plus passengers , their luggage , food , water and assorted other cargo , and the weight adds up			2
capturing @entity9 's final flight the 747 that carried @entity9 weighed about 488,000 pounds			1
@entity72 , a spokesman for @entity10 , says a commercial 747 airliner can weigh more than 800,000 when carrying passengers			1
there will be another chance to see the @entity37 in action later this week			0
that 's when it will carry @entity80 , which was used for tests but never flew in space , will be flown from @entity83 in @entity84 to its new home on board the @entity88 , a retired aircraft carrier turned floating museum in @entity91 .			0

@entity9 *hitches* ride atop a @entity10 to @entity7
the load is not as *taxing* on the *specially* *outfitted* 747 as you might first think
a regular 747 carrying a full *complement* of passengers is much heavier
