@entity0 -- @entity2 may have electrified the 2008 @entity4 presidential ticket when she was picked as @entity6 's running mate , but just four years later her wattage has dimmed on the @entity4 stage			1
she was snubbed for a coveted speaking role at the @entity10 in @entity11 even though @entity6 , the senator from @entity12 who surprised many when he selected @entity15 's governor , is scheduled to speak			2
other speaking spots were doled out to lesser lights like @entity18 , who vied unsuccessfully for the nomination this year			0
once the face of the tea party movement , @entity2 is not among speakers listed for the @entity23 on sunday			1
former presidential candidates rep. @entity25 , @entity26 , and pizza magnate @entity27 are headlining			2
rare opportunity for speakers at @entity4 convention with @entity4 positioning themselves for a presidential run last year , @entity2 drew the most attention when she rode into @entity0 on the back of a motorcycle before launching a bus tour			1
she eventually opted against a @entity37 bid			0
instead , @entity2 has hit the trail for down - ballot candidates in competitive congressional races , stumping for such political mavericks as @entity43 candidate @entity42 and more mainstream politicians like sen. @entity45 of @entity46			1
@entity2 's mission : to recreate the same kind of success she had in the 2010 midterm elections when many of the candidates she endorsed won			1
political experts say @entity2 is also carefully calculating how to wield her burgeoning kingmaker status and star power to position herself for even greater prominence in the party			1
" she has a tremendous amount of pull among the people who make up the 800 - pound gorilla in the party -- the conservative base of the party , " said @entity59 , a @entity4 strategist and senior vice president at @entity61			0
" she will be a force to be reckoned with for the foreseeable future and beyond			2
" @entity65 candidate to receive prime @entity10 speaking slot but first she has to figure out how to get back into the bigger national spotlight , political experts say			1
during this presidential election cycle , @entity2 has been relegated to the farm leagues , said @entity76 , a resident scholar at the @entity77 and co-author of the book " it 's even worse than it looks : how the @entity81 constitutional system collided with the @entity82			1
" it is a role that she slipped into through her own failure to bone up policy matters , he said			0
" i think it 's really interesting that she has fallen so far in the last year that they have no interest in having her appear at the convention , " @entity76 said			2
" in a lot of ways this political capital she pretty much squandered by becoming a @entity99 commentator and going on reality television instead of deepening her knowledge of policy issues			2
she decided to focus more on making money than on throwing herself into remaining deeply relevant in politics			2
" will @entity4 talk about @entity106 , @entity2 ? in her absence , some of the same @entity4 women who @entity2 supported as part of her " @entity111 " pack have come to gain broader acceptance by the party 's mainstream			1
in 2010 , @entity2 endorsed @entity117 sen. @entity116 , calling her a " @entity117 ' mama grizzly ' who has broken barriers			1
" just two years later , @entity116 will speak during a prime - time convention slot on tuesday			0
@entity2 's relative absence on the national stage also allowed @entity25 " to fill the vacuum , " @entity76 said			1
politics , parties keep some away from conventions @entity2 's persona non grata status is " more a matter of they ca n't control her message as they 've already learned , " said @entity134 , professor of @entity81 government at @entity136			1
" it 's always useful when they can showcase @entity4 women , but they 'd rather showcase @entity116 than @entity2			1
" some conservatives feel the party is giving the cold shoulder by not allowing her to speak			0
" i think it 's a big mistake , " @entity59 said			2
" if no other reason you would have a very popular voice using prime time to peel the bark off @entity149 in front of a national television audience			0
" for her part , @entity2 is careful in how she has phrased her notable absence from the convention 's speaking roster			1
" this year is a good opportunity for other voices to speak at the convention and i 'm excited to hear them , " @entity2 wrote in statement earlier this month			1
" as i 've repeatedly said , i support @entity161 and @entity162 in their efforts to replace president @entity149 at the ballot box , and i intend to focus on grassroots efforts to rally independents and the @entity4 base to elect @entity43 and @entity37 members so a wise @entity170 is ready to work with our new president to get our country back on the right path			1
" but do not count @entity2 out , political experts say			1
she still has plenty of pull and will likely bide her time before making her next big move			0
drama is rare in modern conventions " to say she is irrelevant would be a mistake , " @entity76 said			0
" when she gets involved in a primary it has an impact			0
that does n't translate into the broader national role that she could have had			0
but there are second , third , fourth , and fifth acts in @entity81 politics			0
the fact that she is n't a major factor in @entity81 politics now does n't mean she wo n't be in 2013 or a subsequent point			0
" @entity2 backed @entity193 in the @entity195 @entity4 primary against politically beleaguered @entity43 candidate rep. @entity196			1
@entity4 leaders , including @entity161 , are now pushing @entity196 to drop out of the highly contested race against @entity200 sen. @entity199 after the congressman 's controversial comments on " legitimate rape			0
" during a recent @entity99 interview , @entity2 suggested " maybe it is a third - party run of @entity193 that i can get behind			2
" @entity2 is scarcely twiddling her thumbs while sitting on the sidelines			2
her endorsements of congressional candidates have built an army of supporters inside the @entity213			0
" if @entity161 loses by a big margin there will be a move by center - leaning republicans to recapture dominance , " @entity76 said			0
" but you 're not going to see a lot of conservatives saying ' we were wrong about this			0
' you 're going to have another chapter in this ongoing struggle			0
there will be a vacuum , @entity2 could fill that vacuum			2
" and if @entity161 wins @entity2 will be right there on his heels making sure he sticks to his conservative promises , political experts say			1
she 'll be joined by other conservative voices such as @entity25 , @entity27 , rep. @entity235 , @entity236 , and sen. @entity237 , @entity238 € ” all vying for dominance of who represents conservatives			0
" if @entity161 and ( @entity162 ) win , the question is do they implement a series of policies that fit the sharp conservative agenda , " @entity76 said adding that conservatives will rally to force the @entity161 administration to keep its promises			0
" if ( the @entity161 administration ) tack to the center , who 's going to be leading that charge ... @entity2			1

@entity2 's star has been *eclipsed* a bit during this presidential election cycle
@entity2 's focus on supporting congressional will help *bolster* her support in the future
@entity2 's *challenge* , political experts say , will be how she *negotiates* her way back into the national spotlight ; relevance
