-- imagine a gadget that knows your mind better than you do			2
picture a device that can rank the activities in your life that bring you joy , or interject your typed words with your feelings			1
one woman has helped create just that			2
@entity12 believes that the brain -- with its 100 billion neurons that receive , register , and respond to thoughts and impulses -- has the power to accomplish almost anything , if only its power could be properly harnessed			1
her company @entity20 , which she co-founded with @entity21 , has produced @entity22 , a lightweight headband that uses electroencephalography ( @entity26 ) sensors to monitor your brain activity , transmitting that information to a smartphone , laptop or tablet			1
the high - tech headband has been used to pour beer , levitate chairs , or control the lights -- all without the wearer lifting a finger			1
and in a world where technology is often blamed for raising stress levels , 35 - year - old @entity12 believes her $ 300 headband could even help calm us down			1
the @entity44 -- who has worked as a fashion designer , art gallery director , and psychotherapist -- spoke to @entity0 about her influences and vision for the future of technology			2
@entity0 : how does @entity22 help reduce stress ? @entity12 : @entity22 tracks your brain activity			1
your brain sends electro - signals just like your heart does , and this headband is like a heart rate monitor			1
as it tracks your brain activity , it sends that information to your computer , smartphone or tablet , where you can do exercises that track your brain activity in real time , and give you real time feedback to teach you how to calm and settle your mind			1
@entity0 : technology is often blamed for making people stressed -- is there a certain irony in also using it to also calm us down ? ag : technology can definitely be responsible for making people stressed because it pulls at our attention , it distracts us , it increases the number of demands and in some ways decreases our own agency			2
we 're very interested in inverting that on its head and creating solutions that help you calm yourself ; that can help you stay grounded , choose what to focus your attention on , and manage your own mind and your response to the world			0
technology itself is not the evil , it 's the way that it 's implemented			1
technology can have some great solutions for us			0
look at all the amazing medical interventions that we have			0
@entity0 : you 've suggested @entity22 could provide medical benefits for children with @entity107 -- how ? ag : to be clear , @entity22 is not a medical device , it 's a computer product			1
exercises using @entity22 have suggested that they can help people with @entity112 , by helping you increase your state of focused attention			1
we 've had amazing emails -- just recently we had an email from somebody who is 29 years old with @entity112 and after just two days of using @entity22 had noticed a benefit			1
three weeks out they sent me an email saying ' this is not a game changer , this is a life changer			0
' @entity0 : have you had interest in the product from any unexpected places ? ag : we 've been contacted by a lot of sports stars and sports celebrities -- people wanting to use it to improve their sports game			0
we were surprised because we 're so used to thinking of it as a cognitive tool			1
there 's been quite a number of research labs using @entity22 , and they 've been looking at applications in depression , epilepsy , and communications			1
and then we 've also had a lot of interest from companies interested in integrating our technology into their wellness and development programs			0
companies like @entity156 wanting to offer this to their employees to help improve their productivity and their wellness			0
@entity0 : do you have any reservations about the development of mind - mapping devices ? ag : in @entity20 we believe very strongly that you own all your own data			2
we have a very strict privacy policy			0
it 's like a heart rate monitor , it 's very binary so we ca n't read your thoughts , we ca n't read your mind			2
but we 're very much into leading the way on the very responsible use of this technology			0
@entity0 : what inspired you to get involved in this area ? ag : my background is in neuroscience , design and psychotherapy , and i 'm very interested in helping people understand their own minds and use their minds more productively in their own life			0
our brains get in our way in so many ways			0
the things that we think , the feelings that we have , all of these things can be beautiful supports to our life and encourage the lives that we live			0
but they can also cause all kinds of anxiety , worries , all of these things that hold us back			0
particularly women are a huge inspiration to me because we 're so good at holding ourselves back with the thoughts that are in our heads			0
we 're constantly worried about things like ' does this person think this way about me ? ' or ' have i done well enough ? ' or ' have i achieved as much as i 'm supposed to ? ' we have these dialogues within ourselves that can be really debilitating , and you know the answer is ' of course you 're good enough , ' and ' of course you 've done well enough , ' and ' of course you can achieve that			0
' and if you can learn to understand and gain control over your own internal dialogue , you can really learn to sort of undo the shackles that hold you back in your daily life , and your career , and your relationships			2
