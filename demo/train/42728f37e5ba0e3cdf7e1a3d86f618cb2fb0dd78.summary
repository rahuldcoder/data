-- a @entity3 exterminator and father of four children adopted from @entity3 's foster care system has told police that a body found in the pest - control truck he was driving is one of them -- his 10 - year - old daughter , authorities said wednesday			1
@entity14 , 53 , already faces a charge of aggravated child abuse for injuries to the dead girl 's twin , @entity18 , who was also found in the truck , which was parked on the side of @entity23 near @entity24 , @entity3 , officials said			1
according to a probable - cause affidavit filed by the @entity26 , a roadside assistance ranger with the @entity28 stopped to check the red @entity30 pickup monday around 5:30 a.m. and found the 10 - year - old boy inside next to an open gas can			0
the boy " appeared to be in respiratory distress and ( was ) trembling " and his clothing " was soaked with an unknown chemical , " the affidavit said			0
the ranger then found @entity14 on the ground beside the truck and called for help			2
the boy was hospitalized in intensive care with severe burns to his abdomen , upper thighs and buttocks , the affidavit said			1
while examining the boy , doctors noted he had sustained previous injuries , including a broken collarbone , a broken arm , scarring to his buttocks and lower abdomen , and ligature marks on both wrists , police said			0
after @entity14 and his son were taken to a hospital , a worker decontaminating the truck discovered the body of the girl , wrapped in a plastic bag , the document said			1
@entity14 told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter , and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire , the affidavit said			1
@entity14 said he did n't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him , the document added			1
" basically , to paraphrase , he was stating that he placed his daughter in a plastic bag being distraught over her death , " @entity71 told reporters			1
" he drove here from @entity3 accompanied by his son , @entity18			0
he then pulled off to the side of the road saying that he poured gas on his self , intending to light himself on fire			0
his son 's head was in his lap and he decided , after giving his son some sleeping pills , that he was n't going to do that			2
" @entity14 told police that he doused himself with gasoline and inadvertently got some on the boy , @entity88 capt. @entity87 said			1
but , she added , the man 's story does n't add up -- there was no gasoline on the boy			0
instead , he was covered with another chemical whose composition had yet to be determined			0
" that 's why we 're still treating this as a hazmat ( hazardous materials case ) , " she said			0
@entity71 said the chemicals were so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well , he said			0
@entity18 , who was transferred wednesday morning to a specialized burn unit at @entity111 's @entity110 , has not been able to talk to investigators because he is on a breathing tube , she said			0
@entity87 said police would decide how to charge @entity14 further once the autopsy on his daughter determines her cause of death			1
asked whether @entity14 has expressed remorse , she said , " he feels remorse , but we 're not getting consistent statements with what we 're seeing in our evidence			2
" she added , " it 's a complex case			0
" at a hearing wednesday in @entity111 attended by @entity14 's wife , @entity128 , a judge ordered that the remaining two children in the home be placed in foster care			1
@entity3 's @entity133 had opened a child protection investigation within the past few days to look into a complaint involving the @entity14 family , and it was n't the first such complaint , spokesman @entity132 said			1
reporters in the courtroom wednesday heard tales of abuse , mainly concerning the twins , from state officials and experts			2
the caller to the child protection hotline in the latest case reported that the twins were routinely locked in a bathroom for long periods of time and had been bound with tape , the court heard			2
the story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home , officials said in court			1
an investigator told the court that she had showed up last friday night at the family 's home but had not seen the children			1
instead , she said , she had left the family 's house after speaking with @entity14 , planning to return on monday			2
asked why she had not planned to return sooner , she said , " i 'm not allowed to do investigations on a weekend			0
" however , a spokesman for the department , @entity167 , said it is the job of investigators to follow through immediately or refer to someone else in the department to follow through when a matter is urgent			0
