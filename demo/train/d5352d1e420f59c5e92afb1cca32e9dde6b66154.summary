-- world motorcycling champion @entity1 is determined to show he is still the man to beat in 2012 , having set the early pace ahead of the @entity6 season 's opening race in @entity7 on sunday			1
the 26 - year - old @entity8 led the pack at thursday 's first practice session at @entity11 , and was also fastest at the first of two runs on friday			1
the @entity15 rider was followed by @entity17 's 2010 world champion @entity16 of @entity18 in both outings			1
@entity22 's @entity21 rider @entity20 , another to have won the championship , finished third on thursday -- while @entity15 's @entity25 was in that position after friday 's opener			1
@entity1 has been in sparkling form during pre-season testing along with @entity31 teammate @entity30 , who was fourth last year after an injury - hit season			2
" we started this evening with huge chatter issues and i was a little afraid we could n't fix this but after a few more exits we managed to reduce it to a more comfortable level , " @entity1 , who has won the world title with two different teams , said on the @entity6 website after thursday 's session			1
" this is a positive point for the weekend but with such a short session it 's slightly strange			0
it was an okay start			0
" @entity47 : the motorcycling star who shined so bright in contrast , it was a slow start for @entity51 , a seven - time world champion in the sport 's premier class , who finished the thursday session in 10th place and the same again in friday 's first run			1
the @entity18 rider will be hoping to make a comeback after a disappointing 2011 season , his first with @entity22 after a long period of dominance at @entity17			2
@entity51 and teammate @entity20 must also familiarize themselves with the still - new @entity64 machines			2
" i used the hard tire the whole session , trying to do a lot of laps in order to understand it			0
the new tire is much better for warming up , so good for safety , but it started to slide a lot after some laps and made some of the under - steer worse , " @entity51 said			0
" we have to work with the setting and also the electronics			0
the soft will be important for saturday ( qualifying ) , but the hard will be the tire for the race			0

two - time world champion @entity1 wins first practice session of the @entity6 opener in @entity7
the @entity15 rider was followed by @entity17 's @entity16 and @entity22 's @entity20
@entity1 struggles against chatter issues but manages to take the race in 1 ' *54.474*
@entity51 hopes to turn around a disappointing year , finishing 10th
