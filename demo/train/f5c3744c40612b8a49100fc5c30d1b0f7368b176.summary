@entity0 -- the fire that crippled the @entity4 started with a leak in a fuel - oil return line running from one of the ship 's engines , the @entity2 said monday			1
leaking oil hit a hot surface , starting the fire , said @entity13 , the lead investigator for the @entity2			1
@entity13 said there was no indication the leak in a flexible hose section was intentional			1
" fire suppression was immediately activated by the crew , first by waterfog and then by ( carbon dioxide )			1
they did a very good job , " @entity13 said			1
" we are looking at the cause of the fire and why the ship was disabled for so long , and we are also looking at the crew response to the fire as well			1
" @entity13 said the investigation will last for several months			0
the @entity2 said it has conducted 21 interviews with passengers and crew members since thursday , when investigators boarded the ship while it was still at sea			1
@entity13 said the oil return line is one of the items that is routinely inspected , but she did not say when it was last inspected or describe its condition at that time			2
@entity41 , a spokesman with @entity42 , told @entity1 monday that the ship 's last scheduled @entity2 inspection was on november 15			1
@entity41 also said the cruise line agreed with the @entity2 's determination of the origin of the fire			1
@entity49 spokesman @entity49 said the line ran from the ship 's " number - 6 engine " to a fuel tank			1
the @entity54 was on the third day of a planned four - day cruise from @entity56 , @entity57 , to @entity58 when the fire broke out and brought the trip to a halt			2
it was carrying more than 4,200 people , including 3,100 passengers			0
the @entity54 was eventually towed into port in @entity66 , @entity67 , thursday night , and the last passengers disembarked friday			0
stranded on the crippled ship , passengers and crew lived with worsening conditions , as toilets stopped working , and waste spilled onto floors and into hallways			2
passengers had to use plastic bags to collect their waste			0
@entity80 described the ship as " a floating toilet , a floating @entity82 , a floating hell " in a lawsuit filed friday against @entity42 for unspecified damages related to the cruise			0
passengers reported long lines for food , shortages of fresh water and widespread boredom			0
many passengers slept in hallways or outside to escape the odors and heat below decks			0
@entity97 , a senior marine investigator for the @entity2 , told @entity1 sunday that investigators had located the area where flames erupted in the engine room			1
" we know that the fire originated in front of a generator , " @entity97 said			2
" you can see the ignition marks on the wall			0
" there are three generators in the engine room where the fire broke out			1
three other generators are in a second engine room that was n't involved in the fire , @entity97 said			1
the same ship encountered a problem in january with its propulsion system , according to a notice posted on the website of carnival senior cruise director @entity121			0
on saturday , carnival crew members were bused to and from the ship to help with the clean - up			2
one housekeeper told @entity1 it was n't pleasant work but said it had to be done , and the crew was willing to do it			0
passengers have praised the crew for its response during the ordeal			2
because the @entity54 is a @entity135 - flagged vessel , the @entity133 is the primary investigative agency and will work with the @entity2 and the @entity136			2
investigators pulled the voyage data recorder , a device that records alarms , voice communications on the bridge , engine speed , navigation information and rudder angle , @entity97 said			0
it appears that the fire suppression worked as designed , @entity97 said friday			0
the engineer who was on watch around dawn february 10 saw the fire ignite over a video feed and immediately notified the bridge , @entity97 said			0
on crippled cruise ship , icky jobs fell to ' amazing ' crew @entity156 filed over ' floating hell ' cruise @entity1 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0
