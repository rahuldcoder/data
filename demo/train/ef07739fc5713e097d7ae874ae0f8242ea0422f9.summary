-- an hour - long documentary that aired tuesday night on @entity3 state tv made the case that the @entity5 long has been a force for turmoil , unfairness and violence , not peace , in the @entity11			1
the special programming did not focus on the back - and - forth that has precipitated a possible military strike on @entity3 , instead stepping back decades to offer an anti-american viewpoint that casts the @entity17 government as a champion of justice and the @entity21 people			1
since the days of president @entity24 , the documentary alleges , staunchly pro-israeli @entity5 leaders have consistently been against @entity3 because of the latter 's opposition to @entity27			2
what 's happening now , the special claims , is the culmination of a decades - long @entity5 effort to destroy @entity3 largely for that reason			2
" if @entity3 is the oldest ( community ) in the world , then it is now in the heart of the world , " the documentary begins			0
the well - crafted piece -- which included archival footage , interviews with analysts and commentary -- was broadcast at 11 p.m. ( 5 p.m. et ) , which happened to be the same time that @entity5 secretary of state @entity46 and @entity5 defense secretary @entity47 made their case for military action against @entity3 to the @entity51			1
@entity53 's offensive remarks about @entity3 led by president @entity55 , @entity5 officials have accused @entity3 's government of not only using conventional weapons to kill its own people , but also carrying out chemical weapons attacks			1
@entity17 has denied the latter allegations , though @entity55 -- who has been supportive of an end game in which president @entity62 leaves office -- has contended there should be a military response to prevent more such attacks			0
the @entity3 documentary 's arguments were presented within the context of history , albeit a version highly favorable to that of @entity62 and his father , and predecessor , @entity75 , as well as their longtime allies			0
it begins in the late 1970s , with video showing @entity24 's efforts -- in the documentary 's words -- to " impose peace " in the @entity11			0
in this scenario and others to come , @entity3 was at odds with and isolated by the @entity5 because , the tv special claimed , it chose not to join @entity88 in working with @entity27			1
@entity89 and groups fighting alongside @entity3 troops in @entity92 , like @entity93 , are characterized in the documentary in a positive light for their steadfast opposition to @entity27 and support of the @entity21 people			1
the film alleges the @entity5 pushed late @entity102 leader @entity101 to fight @entity89 for eight years to drain both countries ' resources			0
number of @entity3 refugees rises about 2 million the documentary does n't stop there in casting aspersions on @entity110			2
it accuses the @entity5 of training and funding @entity114 extremists , including the group that became @entity116 , and putting them in @entity117 to battle troops from what was then the @entity120			1
the special ends with a clip from the late 1980s or early 1990s that shows @entity3 president @entity125 meeting with his @entity5 counterpart , @entity126			2
it promises more such programming to come , without detailing when it might air			0
the documentary offered scarce mention of the ongoing civil war that 's racked @entity3 since 2011			0
the @entity133 has said more than 100,000 people -- many of them civilians -- have died since @entity62 's forces began cracking down on protesters , setting off a chain of events that led to a war opposing fighting forces			0
another 2 million people have fled the war - torn nation , according to the @entity133 refugee agency			0
the big debate : should @entity5 strike @entity3 ?			1
