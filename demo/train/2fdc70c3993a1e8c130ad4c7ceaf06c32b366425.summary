@entity0 -- on sunday , about 100,000 @entity3 spectators -- including a bevy of @entity3 's top celebrities and corporate bigwigs -- will pack into a stadium to watch two teams go at each other with everything they 've got			1
no , it 's not cricket			2
it 's not even hockey			0
it 's football and the all - new , swish , @entity14			1
the 10 - week tournament features mostly @entity3 players , but also a number of " marquee " @entity19 soccer stars , admittedly out of their prime but still huge draws : former @entity24 strikers @entity22 and @entity25 , and former @entity26 attackers @entity27 and @entity28			1
the stated aim of the league is to promote the beautiful game in @entity3 , a country of 1.2 billion people that has long languished in football 's global rankings -- 158th in the world on @entity37 's latest list			1
similar to @entity39 ( @entity39 ) in the @entity40 , eight franchise teams from across @entity3 will face off against each other twice each before heading to a set of play - offs in december			1
as a mandatory requirement , each team must consist of 14 @entity3 domestic players and four local players from the same state			1
the teams have entered alliances with several high profile @entity19 clubs including @entity53 , @entity54 , and @entity55			2
@entity28 , a member of @entity26 's famous 2004 " @entity57 " squad is now the public face for @entity59			0
when @entity1 caught up with him in @entity60 , he said : " i went to the @entity40 to promote the game there , and it worked really well			0
i want do the same thing here			0
" i feel like i can give something back to football , " says @entity28			0
however , competing with cricket as the numero uno sport will be an uphill challenge			2
@entity3 's cricket craze @entity3 has always been a cricket - crazy nation			1
while the few football stadiums in the country remain empty , @entity3 rarely miss an opportunity to see their cricket team play , flocking in the tens of thousands to cheer the " @entity74			1
" their team has performed well in recent years , a major highlight being the @entity78 triumph on home soil			0
the @entity3 team was also ranked number one in the world at one stage , at both test cricket and one day international cricket -- the sport 's two most popular versions			1
the country 's cricket governing body , the @entity88 , is the richest and most influential in the sport , capitalizing on @entity3 's appetite through multimillion - dollar sponsorship deals and broadcasting rights			1
@entity3 football , on the other hand , is its indigent cousin			1
@entity3 lacks even basic infrastructure for the sport to grow and prosper			1
there are only six stadiums that meet the current @entity37 guidelines ; maintaining them to international standards has been a regular concern			0
the latest @entity105 places @entity3 at a humbling 158th place , eight down from the previous month			2
@entity3 is set to slip further after losing to @entity107 last week			2
the national team has failed to qualify for the @entity109 since 1950 and the last time it tasted success at an international sporting event was more than five decades ago , when it managed to beat @entity113 to win the @entity114			1
a football revival ? the @entity14 aspires to become the premier football league in @entity3 , providing a platform to unearth domestic talent			2
the hope is that a cocktail of big corporate money , @entity123 's glitz , and some of @entity125 's former superstars will help local players further develop their skills , and boost interest			0
@entity3 broadcasters are betting on a big response			0
@entity131 , the chief operating officer of @entity132 , told @entity1 the games will be available on an unprecedented number of platforms			0
" we are broadcasting the games in five different languages			0
@entity139 and @entity140 is the norm			0
but for the first time , we 're also broadcasting in @entity142 , @entity143 , and @entity144			0
" there are more than 80 million @entity142 speakers in @entity3 , and more than 30 million each of @entity143 and @entity144			0
@entity28 thinks the @entity14 can transform the sport in @entity3			2
" if i can help inspire the kids , then that 's the future of @entity3 football , " he said			1
as top @entity19 soccer clubs look to capture more fans in @entity154 , perhaps they will face competition for @entity3 viewers from an unexpected source : @entity3 clubs			0

ten - week tournament features mostly @entity3 players , as well as some high - profile foreign stars
despite having a population of 1.2 billion , @entity3 's national team is ranked 158th in the world
football is looking to compete with other sports like cricket
but @entity3 lacks even basic infrastructure for the sport to grow and prosper
