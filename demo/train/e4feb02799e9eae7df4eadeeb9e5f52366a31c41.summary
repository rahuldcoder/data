-- i 'd been to the club several times before			2
i love to come to @entity3 and any time i got a chance , when @entity6 was still alive , i would always try to schedule to see him play			1
it was a thrilling night			0
i had brought my @entity10 program for @entity6 to sign ; the bonus of having sir @entity6 there too was incredible			1
he seemed very , very cordial			0
now he was having a good time , too -- because that was in the early stages of his relationship with the lady we do n't even mention any more			0
at one point , sir @entity6 got up on stage with @entity6 and started clowning around with him , saying how much the @entity22 loved him and stole his songs but had never been able to give him any credit			1
so he got a one - dollar bill and handed it to @entity26 , who was just beaming			0
i approached him after the performance to have my book signed and take a photo			1
there were only about sixty people in the club , it 's a very small room , so sir @entity6 gave everyone at the @entity6 performance a very special experience			1
@entity37 : see more of your encounters with music icons he looked every person in the eye ; you could see the electricity coming from his eyes to theirs and he was just so gracious			2
i think he really enjoys being one of the normal people , and not being on a pillar			0
i had met him once before after a concert , very , very briefly , but this was something special			2
i 've been a huge @entity22 fan from day one , when i was ten years old and watched the @entity52 , the television program that introduced the @entity22 to the @entity54			0
i 'm a musician myself , i play bass guitar with a little band in @entity58 , where i live			0
we love making music and that was inspired by sir @entity6 .			1
