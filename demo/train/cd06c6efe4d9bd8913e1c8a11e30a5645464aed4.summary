-- you 've found a fabulous story to tell			2
you 've snared the hard - to - get interviews			0
you 're on the scene to watch the most dramatic moments unfold			0
the quotes are memorable , the tension palpable			0
it 's a story that really matters			1
now you 're back at your desk , buried in a mountain of notes , audio , video and stills			0
time to sharpen your editing chops			1
what drew you to the story in the first place ? what surprised you ? what choked you up ? and , most importantly , what does it all mean ? questions are your friend at every storytelling stage -- from idea incubation to reporting , writing and producing			1
they can help focus and shape the story			1
here are five questions you should ask -- and answer -- while whittling down that mountain of material to build your story			1
it 's called editing , but it 's really just thinking smartly			1
through whose eyes am i telling this story ? whether told in words or pictures , many stories are seen through a wide - angle lens			2
and the result is that each quote and fact seems to carry the same weight			0
the story covers a lot of ground , but fails to go deep			2
often it is more effective to change that focus , from wide - angle to close - up			2
in the aftermath of the earthquake in @entity59 , the mounting death toll threatened to render the victims faceless			0
and the enormity of the rescue efforts began to feel unfathomable			0
but @entity0 's @entity63 focused on small , singular stories that stood for the universal : she told of one rescuer who became a woman 's last hope			1
she took us inside the mind of one survivor pulled from the rubble after six days			0
taking this approach , @entity72 followed the advice of @entity75 : " do n't write about man ; write about ' a ' man			2
who has something at stake ? @entity81 , a former newspaper reporter who is now a producer for @entity82 , was asked to interview the winner of the @entity84			0
but a key decision turned " @entity87 on @entity88 " into a delicious surprise			0
the writing sparkles , but it 's the storytelling that enchants			1
read this gem of story , and see what important question led @entity81 to a masterful stroke			2
what 's going to happen next ? take advantage of a story 's mysteries , the questions raised			1
@entity100 - winning writer and teacher @entity99 calls this question -- " what 's going to happen next ? " -- the engine that propels the story forward			1
it 's like sex , says another writer and editor : you want to hold back the climax			1
in a story ( as in lovemaking ) , if the climax comes too soon , how long will you stick with it ? in writing about his travels with two @entity118 on a cross-country road trip for @entity120 , @entity0 's @entity116 is careful to promise the reader that something surprising and dramatic is going to happen without giving it away			1
are you hooked by his hint that the trip was n't all " peace , love and @entity128 " ? 4			0
what 's the story really about ? writing guru @entity131 offers two questions to guide a storyteller in determining what material goes in the story and what hits the cutting - room floor : 1			1
what is the story about ? 2			0
what is the point ? the first question is about content			0
the second is about meaning			0
everything in your story must go to one of those questions			1
otherwise , it stays in your notes			0
another useful exercise : describe your story in three to five words			0
now reduce that description to one word			0
if you ca n't , you 're still focused on the story 's content			1
finding just one word will force you to name its theme			0
@entity0 's @entity160 wrote about @entity162 oil spill victims from @entity163 traveling to @entity164 to see what they could learn from the victims of the @entity169 spill more than 20 years ago			1
that 's what her story was about			1
what was the point ? read @entity160 's story to see if you can tell how she answered that question			1
where should the story begin ? once you know the theme of your story , you have the answer to this question : begin with a scene or a moment or description that contains the story 's essential meaning			1
note the first image in @entity193 's video " @entity198 , " about the pressure women in @entity196 face to bear a male child			0
it contains the story 's essence			2
look at the first paragraph in @entity81 's @entity100 - winning story about a boy diagnosed with the same deadly disease as his brother and facing terrible odds			2
when you learn to investigate your notes and tape for what lies beneath -- the meaning -- your storytelling becomes just that : meaningful			2
ready to give these tips a try ? do this : tell the story of an object that reveals something about someone you know			0
