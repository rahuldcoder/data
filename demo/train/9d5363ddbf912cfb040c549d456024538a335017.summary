-- what has caused the @entity2 to strike so hard inside @entity3 ? @entity5 's deputy prime minister @entity4 told me @entity5 felt compelled to respond to what it sees as relentless @entity10 rocket attacks into @entity5 which terrify civilians and force schools and business closures			1
but the view from @entity3 is very different			2
palestinians there say that what the @entity2 military calls surgical strikes routinely kill civilians and they are cut off from the world with a total land , air and sea blockade			0
faq : what is @entity26 ? is this a serious escalation of the @entity5 / @entity10 conflict or just another skirmish ? this is the most serious @entity2 offensive on @entity3 since early 2009 , when an @entity2 military ground war killed up to 1,400 palestinians and 13 @entity2			1
the question now is whether this will remain a contained incident or if this will turn into something bigger			0
@entity5 's military says preparations are being made for a ground offensive , should the need for one arise			1
the coming days will determine how serious this incident is			0
@entity42 : photos and video from inside the protests in @entity5 already , we are seeing signs that this @entity3 offensive is causing regional rifts			1
@entity50 , which brokered a recent ceasefire agreement between @entity26 and @entity5 , was so angry at the offensive it has recalled its ambassador to @entity5			1
opinion : new dangers in familiar @entity3 violence is there a danger that this will spill into wider turmoil ? regionally , the @entity61 is looking more and more unstable by the week			2
the tragic @entity63 civil war is spilling over into @entity64 , the occupied @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
@entity5 is concerned about @entity69 's nuclear program and the possibility that it will strike @entity69 nuclear facilities are adding to those tensions			0
and now @entity50 is signaling displeasure with @entity5 's @entity3 offensive			1
will that test its treaties with the jewish state ? there are many moving parts to keep an eye on			0
are you there ? share photos , video but stay safe what does it mean for the stalled @entity61 peace process ? the moribund @entity61 peace process is now suffering another setback			0
remember , there 's an election next january and some have accused @entity2 prime minister @entity93 of launching this offensive in order to benefit politically from appearing to take tough action against @entity26			2
there are no signs that peace talks between @entity5 and the @entity101 government in the @entity102 or any element of @entity26 ' leadership is looking likely on any level .			2

@entity5 says its attack was in response to @entity26 rocket attacks
it is the most serious offensive in @entity3 since 2009
@entity5 says contingency plans for a ground attack are in place
