@entity0 , @entity1 -- an international team of climate scientists is calling on the public to help with a new initiative aimed at predicting how the climate will change during the 21st century			1
using the collective power of ordinary home computers , scientists from the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 will run thousands of regional climate modeling tests which would otherwise take much longer to complete , even on the most up - to - date supercomputers			1
the regional modeling project builds on the global modeling work started in 2003 by @entity9 climate scientist @entity19 and his team at the @entity22 department at the @entity9 's @entity23			1
project coordinator @entity24 told @entity2 : " up to now , participants have run global models for us			1
what 's new today is that the global model you download has a regional model embedded inside it which models in much more detail , and is capable of capturing weather features that the global model is too coarse to capture			2
" with the help of the public 's pcs scientists will now start running regional climate models for the western @entity10 , @entity40 and southern @entity11			1
people interested in signing up to the project can visit http://climateprediction.net/weatherathome / where they can download all the necessary tools to start running regional climate models from their own computers			1
" there 's a very neat graphics package that gives you rotational globe and a world view			0
the new experiment gives you the regional view so you can see various things -- temperature , clouds , pressure -- evolving as your model runs , " @entity24 said			0
each regional model takes between five and seven days to complete			0
there is no limit on users and the program is designed to run when your computer is idle			2
@entity24 says running the climate model will not affect the running speed of your computer			2
" the more people who sign up , the more science we can do , " she said			0
to date , the global modeling project has attracted over 300,000 participants -- of which 50,000 are dedicated users -- from 138 countries and has run over 90 million model years of climate data			2
for the regional modeling , @entity23 is being assisted by @entity77 and @entity11 's @entity78			0
@entity77 will be examining data from models of extreme precipitations in the western @entity10			1
@entity82 , director of the @entity83 at the university , told @entity2 : " there are early indications from modeling that we might see a big increase in extreme precipitation events			0
based on that very immature science people are already making decisions about culvert size and bridge clearances and things like that			0
" these have real costs associated with them and we hope that in the next couple of years we 'll be able to provide much better scientific values for those decisions			0
