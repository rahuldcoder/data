perhaps they could be called x-women			0
for 50 years , @entity3 ' x-men have been known for being ahead of their time in terms of diversity and tackling issues of social justice			2
in this week 's " x-men " # 1 , the team of mutant superheroes will look a little different than what fans are used to : they 're all women			1
not only is it the first time that an x-men team has been all female ( in a primary " x-men " title , no less ) , but storm , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 join the @entity24 as one of two @entity3 female super-teams			1
before that , the best - known all - female super teams were @entity30 ' " @entity29 , " introduced in 1996 , and 1998 's indie book " @entity32			1
" ( another all - woman team was pitched to @entity3 and reportedly rejected , and in 2011 , the sole @entity3 title with a solo female protagonist , " @entity36 , " was canceled because of low sales , while " @entity38 " will be canceled as of august )			1
never before has a household name team like @entity2 been turned over to only women			1
but the late professor @entity42 's school has been named after the @entity2 's first female member , @entity43 , since 2011			1
if any existing superhero team were going to be rebooted this way , it would be the @entity2 , with its many strong female characters			1
@entity48 recently spoke with " x-men " writer @entity49 and editor @entity50 about this historic moment in @entity52			1
@entity48 : did you originally set out to put together an all - female team ? @entity50 : this is 100 % something i 've wanted to do in my heart of hearts for years			1
and when @entity49 started on @entity2 , his team was only women			1
@entity49 : it 's kind of hard to pin down exactly how it got to this			1
it was kind of easy to make that leap			0
@entity50 : people seemed to be connecting with it			0
it was just the team that worked and gelled			2
it was the team @entity49 wanted to write and the team that i wanted to read			1
there 's been a lot of talk about female characters in comics			1
this felt like the time was right			0
@entity49 : x-men is so rife with powerful female characters anyway , more so than any comic book universe or group			1
our lineup is total a-listers			0
you can build a team with your eyes closed			2
@entity48 : how was it decided who would make up the team ? @entity49 : @entity50 and i spoke for six months about this			1
new ideas came to us ; other @entity2 books were being developed			0
i do n't know if we picked the cast first and figured how they would work together			2
@entity50 : it went through so many iterations , i honestly do n't know how we got here either			2
@entity49 : i like storm			1
i wanted her without a doubt			0
we were gon na bring jubilee back ; she has been absent for a period of time			0
these were like the best of the best characters			2
it made sense to pack it with big names			2
the characters have histories with each other which makes for a natural team makeup			1
@entity48 : do you think this is in keeping with the @entity2 tradition ? @entity50 : this is definitely not the first all - female team in comics , but there 's also a history of finding it harder to do			1
for me , it 's tough because you want to do it			0
if it does n't succeed , it gets pointed out that that 's because it 's a team of all women			1
@entity49 : i 've seen that happen			2
even now , there 's a lot of peanut gallery comments about the fact that it 's a female team			1
it 's happened before and been unfairly blamed			1
i think what makes this so great			0
through @entity50 's hard work at @entity3 , this is " x-men " # 1			1
if any book is gon na have a shot at it , i truly believe it 's gon na stick			2
we 're not gon na bring in dudes to bring up sales			0
it 's gon na be a powerhouse seller			0
@entity48 : since this is book is part of the " @entity159 " line , will we see any changes in some of the characters ? @entity50 : a couple of the costumes are recently new			2
@entity49 : so far , there 's one modification to one of their powers			1
there 's a child in the mix , and that 's a pretty big change			0
@entity50 : a lot of these characters are in other books also			0
we want to make sure you 're getting the same character across all these books			0
we want to make sure that we 're reflecting what 's going on with @entity18 in " @entity181 , " for example			0
@entity49 : i definitely have a lot of flexibility with jubilee			2
she 's a favorite character of mine			0
i would n't call her the leader , but she 's definitely the focus at the beginning here			2
@entity48 : what else can we expect in the first few issues ? @entity49 : there 's this existing @entity2 villain called @entity196 , an infectious bacteria that can infect host bodies			1
we have that guy back as a new persona			0
he brings along his evil twin who becomes sort of an uber - villain			0
the @entity2 and @entity196 are forced to work together			0
this is an action book			0
this is the straight - up action comic			0
everyone is dropped into fight scenes and it never lets up			0
if there 's any one mandate , it 's " bigger and more			0
