one day , many years from now , future generations will look back at this time in our country 's history and wonder what in the hell were we thinking			0
the @entity8 are famous for no reason , same - sex marriage is controversial for stupid reasons , and somehow the " @entity12 " franchise is a cash cow			2
but our culture 's biggest sin may well be the auto - tuned syrup we 've allowed to dominate the pop charts			1
all - time chart records are handed to vacuous acts such as the @entity21 and singing awards are given to vocal lightweights such as @entity24			2
history will show a dark time in our culture in which a million followers on @entity29 became a key component to winning a @entity31			2
but thank @entity32 for @entity33			1
that 's what i was thinking as i was watching her performance during sunday 's @entity39			0
she recreated the video for her current single , " try , " a midtempo ballad about the ups and downs of an imperfect relationship			0
where there is desire there is gon na be a flame where there is a flame someone 's bound to get burned but just because it burns does n't mean you 're gon na die you 've got ta get up and try try try singing words like that live with the right level of emotion that @entity33 is known for is hard enough			1
doing so while in engaged in an @entity61 , complete with lifts , is breathtaking			0
she received a standing ovation afterward , much in the same way she commanded one at the @entity67 as she swung over the audience 's heads on a trapeze , asking : have you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air ? have you ever looked fear in the face and said , " i just do n't care " ? it would all seem like a meat - dress wearing gimmick if she did n't have the voice and lyrics to back it up			1
but she does , and thus we can all breathe a sigh of relief knowing her voice will be there for future generations to discover when looking back at us			0
@entity33 wo n't be able to scrub our record clean singlehandedly -- there 's just too much manufacturing for one person to overcome			1
but at least there will be evidence for my great - great grandkids to see that we were n't all " @entity98 's " sheep			2
while @entity100 has a tendency to oversing , @entity99 ca n't sing , and @entity102 sorta stopped singing , @entity33 has managed to carve a brilliant 13 - year - career by being something that is incredibly rare these days -- an artist			1
maybe the most underrated artist we 've had on the radio in the past 20 years			0
that 's not to suggest she 's been ignored -- @entity33 has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide			1
it 's just when you look at the amount of publicity given to her in comparison to say , @entity114 or @entity115 , well there is no comparison			1
we know she is phenomenal , but the others are considered phenomenons			0
@entity114 and @entity115 are worthy of the accolades , but whenever i listen to @entity33 's " dear mr. president , " " @entity128 " or " @entity129 , " i feel the need to atone for us not making more room for her in the pop culture paradigm			1
@entity134 -- one of the most respected names in the music industry -- ranked the top five performances from the @entity39			0
for them , @entity33 's brave rendition of " try " was second			2
tops was psy doing " @entity142 " with @entity143			0
@entity143 ! ? ! yes ... we 're going to have a lot to answer for someday .			0
