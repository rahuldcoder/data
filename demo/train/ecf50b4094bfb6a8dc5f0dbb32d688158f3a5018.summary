-- colleges and universities of all types , from for - profits to two - year colleges and @entity7 schools , have been the focus of much debate recently as many students are struggling to meet the ever - growing costs of tuition and student loan debts			1
but one angle has been subject to less scrutiny : what are colleges and universities providing for the most talented and accomplished students ? if something we call higher education is n't the best choice for our highest achieving students , then what is its purpose ? in this regard , @entity27 , the billionaire co-founder of @entity28 and one of the most vocal critics of higher education , believes that college classrooms are doing little to equip our future @entity33 , innovators and industry leaders			1
some of the brightest students might be better off not going to college at all , being forced to take classes in which they have no interest and leaving with burdensome student loan debt			1
last year , @entity27 took things into his own hands and started the " 20 under 20 @entity45 , " a program that brings together the most enterprising students younger than 20 and offers them a $ 100,000 grant to skip college and explore their own research and entrepreneurial ideas			1
under the tutelage of investors , scientists and like - minded industry tycoons , students are able to develop connections , court investors and promote their businesses on a level that @entity27 says colleges can not provide			1
in may 2011 , @entity27 announced the first 24 @entity63 ( the applicants were so extraordinary @entity27 had to add four more spots )			2
so far , the results have been impressive			0
@entity67 , 19 , who founded @entity67 to improve solar energy technology in developing countries , recently won the @entity71 award and $ 260,000 to continue her efforts			0
@entity73 , 20 , started a company called @entity75 to develop mobile and tablet social learning games for children			2
@entity75 reportedly launched with $ 1.5 million in venture capital funding			0
@entity81 , 20 , founded @entity82 , a social movement based on the idea that college is n't the only path to success			0
@entity89 / @entity88 recently signed @entity81 to publish his first book , " @entity91 , " a how - to book on developing skills that schools do n't teach			0
@entity81 : college is a waste of time according to @entity98 , head of the @entity99 , more than 10 of the fellows have started their own companies , and one of them released his own product on the market			0
the inaugural class has been so successful that @entity27 has already accepted applications for 2012 fellows , and the winners will be announced next month			2
higher education has taken notice , and @entity27 's experiment has n't gone without criticism			1
@entity113 , a sociologist at @entity114 , dubbed @entity27 's program " an act of total self - indulgence			1
" critics argue that @entity27 's cherry - picked prodigies would thrive no matter what they spent the next fours years doing			1
for example , @entity73 , mentioned above , dropped out of @entity122 at 19 as a fourth - year neuroscience doctorate candidate			0
others say that @entity27 's program serves only the interest of the smallest group of the most intellectually advanced students and would in no way aid the overwhelming majority of college - bound students			1
my view : how to create innovators and yet , @entity27 has already rattled the ivory towers			2
facing the prospect of losing their best students to @entity27 and other programs like his , universities have scrambled to add their own entrepreneurial programs			2
@entity122 created @entity142 , an accelerator for student entrepreneurs			0
@entity146 's @entity145 just announced the launch of @entity148 , a new startup accelerator to provide funding , facilities and access to top mentors for new student startups			0
other venture capitalists have noticed similar shortcomings in higher education and are competing to fill the void			2
former @entity160 ceo @entity159 recently secured $ 25 million in funding to create an elite global online university targeting the best students around the world			0
his endeavor has already attracted the likes of @entity166 , the former president of @entity167 , to his advisory board			0
it 's still too early to tell how @entity27 's experiment will turn out			1
startups , after all , are always prone to failure			0
however , he is right about one thing -- higher education deserves more scrutiny and competition			2
if students like @entity73 are so quick to leave the university setting for @entity27 's program , then is it truly the best place for the brightest students to be ? with bloated tuition costs and questionable academic standards , it 's time we challenge the conventional wisdom that college is the only path to advanced education and economic success			1
@entity27 starts at the very top of the higher education system , but the reverberations may be felt throughout			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : what does an *expensive* higher education offer gifted students ?
@entity197 : @entity27 started " 20 under 20 @entity45 " to help the brightest students
some critics think @entity27 's program is self - indulgent , @entity197 points out
@entity197 : however , it forces colleges to *rethink* their bloated costs and academic standards
