all those are translatable skills			0
" @entity73 's experience working in a rural health clinic in @entity89 after a major earthquake helped him find compassion and resiliency within himself			2
" if you just stay in your own country , you have a certain mindset about your own culture			0

we recommend expanding on that experience			0
did they volunteer , work , study ? " she said			0
@entity133 , a spokesperson for job - posting site @entity134 , says to write out what you learned and how it 's relevant to your professional performance on your resume			1

" it depends on what they did , " she explained			0
running a public policy program , she looks for applicants who are realistic about job expectations			2
" i find that people who paid to volunteer abroad sort of just take pictures and hold babies , " she said			2
" it depends on your study abroad program , too			2

the @entity180 at @entity182 student spent a year in @entity183 teaching social studies to a class of nine students			0

" those frustrating and rewarding moments helped hone her classroom management skills			0
after @entity204 came back from @entity183 , she got her second student teaching job at an inner - city school in @entity4			2
