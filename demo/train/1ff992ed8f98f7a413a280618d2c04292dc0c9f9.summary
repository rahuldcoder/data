-- it 's been arguably the biggest sports - debate question of the past month : who would win in a head - to - head matchup between the original 1992 @entity6 basketball " @entity10 " and the 2012 edition that just won gold in @entity9 ? @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , or @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 ? we 'll never know , right ? maybe not			1
@entity18 is ready to let the fans decide by including both superstar teams in their upcoming basketball video game , " @entity22			1
" the fantasy matchup , in which gamers can match both teams in a virtual showdown for the ages , is the result of a partnership with @entity30 , the organization that represents the @entity31 in world basketball events			0
the public debate over which team is better started before the @entity9 games when the @entity36 ' @entity14 said he thought he and his teammates could beat the 1992 squad			1
" well , just from a basketball standpoint , they obviously have a lot more size than we do , " @entity14 told reporters after a pre-olympics practice			0
" we have just a bunch of young racehorses , guys that are eager to compete			0
it 'd be a tough one , but i think we 'd pull it out			0
" " in one game , we can beat them			0
" the resulting back - and - forth between members from both teams sparked an idea from " @entity22 " executive producer @entity59 why not let the fans interact , play the game , and decide who is the better team ? " in ' @entity22 , ' we 're giving fans the opportunity to play as two of the best teams ever assembled in sporting history , literally putting the debate right into their hands , " @entity59 said in a statement			1
the original @entity10 is considered one of the most dynamic sports teams ever assembled			2
@entity75 players , including @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , came together to crush international opponents and win @entity6 gold in @entity83 , @entity84			1
this year 's @entity6 team featured many likely future @entity86 , including @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity15			0
not surprisingly , the famously competitive @entity76 believes his team would triumph over the 2012 bunch			2
in an interview this week , he said playing both teams in " @entity22 " is likely to start more arguments than finish them			1
" when you stack all the stats , which is in some ways how the game is going to be viewed and discussed , our stats are going to be a lot better than their stats , " @entity76 said in a conference call with reporters			2
" i think it 's going to start debates			1
i do n't think it 's going to end any			2
the only way it would end is for us to lace ' em back up and play them			0
" @entity76 thinks " @entity22 " gamers will get a good appreciation of the different styles of play over the two eras			1
the third - leading scorer in @entity116 history also offered some advice to fans playing as the @entity10 in the new video game			1
" if you want to score inside , you have to throw it to @entity80 ( @entity80 ) or @entity122 ( @entity123 ) , " @entity76 said			2
" if you want to throw it to the perimeter , @entity11 ( @entity77 ) or @entity124 can set up			0
" @entity127 , i 'm pretty sure i can score in any environment			0
" @entity76 also believes the inclusion of the all - star teams will give international gamers a chance to experience @entity31 - style hoops firsthand			2
" with the @entity30 portion ( of " @entity22 " ) , you are going to have a lot of @entity135 being able to play the @entity10 fantasy			1
