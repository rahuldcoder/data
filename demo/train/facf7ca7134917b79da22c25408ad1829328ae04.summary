-- there 's a big difference between a political debate about same - sex marriage and the recent hard - fought court challenge to the @entity7 ban , @entity8			1
in politics , anything goes : vague , sinister comments about same - sex marriage threatening children or undermining the sanctity of heterosexual marriage were prevalent during the @entity8 campaign			1
in court , same - sex marriage opponents needed solid evidence to back up these and other claims			1
despite " able and energetic counsel , " they never produced it			0
that 's why they lost , resoundingly , in the federal district court			2
and that lack of evidence should dog opponents up through the chain of appeals that is now beginning , because appellate courts are required to review only the evidence in the court record and to give great deference to judge @entity36 's findings of fact			1
he was there , after all , presiding over the trial , and the appellate judges were n't			0
and what a lopsided trial he presided over			0
all the anti-same - sex marriage arguments imploded when subjected to the rules of evidence			1
" you do n't have to have evidence of this point , " counsel responded to the judge 's question asking what support existed for their claim that " responsible procreation is really at the heart of society 's interest in regulating marriage			1
" no , sorry , at trial , you do have to have evidence			0
of this point and every point			0
( and since -- as even @entity67 justice @entity66 once pointed out in another case -- the sterile and elderly are allowed to marry , it ca n't be all about procreation			2
) trials turn on admissible evidence -- primarily credible witness testimony or documents , in this type of case			2
and @entity8 proponents did not have it			2
over and over again , @entity36 's decision focused on the evidence , the mountain of reliable facts offered by gay marriage advocates , and the glaring lack thereof proffered by gay marriage opponents			1
the same - sex - marriage advocates presented eight lay witnesses and nine expert witnesses			1
one plaintiff testified that marriage would be a way to tell " our friends , our family ... that this is a lifetime commitment ... we are not girlfriends			0
" the other three presented similarly compelling , credible testimony about the damage to their dignity , the economic losses , the sting of discrimination they suffered daily due to their legally enshrined second - class citizenship			0
opponents offered exactly zero lay witnesses to explain , say , how their heterosexual marriages would be undermined by same - sex marriage , or how children would be harmed by a neighbor 's same - sex marriage -- though these were central arguments made during the @entity8 campaign			1
the evidence at trial proved that children raised by gay or lesbian couples are just as likely to be well - adjusted as children raised by heterosexual parents			2
that gay folks are no more likely to be child molesters than heterosexuals			0
that marriage has evolved in this country to allow for women 's equality and interracial marriage			0
that no " undermining " of straight marriage would occur if marriage further evolved to allow same - sex couples to marry , too			1
this evidence was put forward by an impressive roster of @entity134 and @entity135 marriage historians , @entity136 and @entity138 economists , a @entity138 psychology professor , a @entity141 epidemiologist , a psychologist and a political scientist			2
many had written extensive peer - reviewed articles and books in their areas of expertise			0
all their testimony withstood full and fair cross-examination			0
on the other side , pretrial , same - sex marriage opponents had designated a number of witnesses			1
but when push came to shove , at trial they elected not to call most of them			0
@entity36 pointed out that they did n't call a single official proponent of @entity8 to explain the discrepancies between the arguments in favor of @entity8 presented to voters and the arguments presented in court			1
in a nice trial " gotcha " moment , gay marriage advocates read in deposition testimony from two witnesses who were to testify for the other side -- yet their pretrial testimony instead supported the gay marriage advocates			0
opponents offered no explanation for why their witnesses flipped			0
ultimately , same - sex marriage opponents called only two witness , the founder of the @entity183 , who the court found lacked qualifications to offer expert testimony , and a @entity189 professor , who " sought to rebut only a limited aspect " of the plaintiffs ' case			1
here 's the kind of " evidence " gay marriage opponents offered at trial : homosexuals are 12 times more likely to molest children , their witness argued , and allowing same - sex marriage would cause states " to fall into @entity202 's hands			1
" the witness ' source of information ? " the internet			0
" there 's not a judge in this country who could rely on " evidence " like that			0
@entity36 made 80 meticulous , detailed findings of fact on every aspect of marriage , with hundreds of citations to the evidence cited at trial			2
perhaps the most critical finding was no. 58 : " @entity8 places the force of law behind stigmas against gays and lesbians , including ... gays and lesbians are not as good as heterosexuals			2
" ultimately , @entity36 found , that was the heart of what same - sex marriage opponents advanced : " a desire to advance the belief that opposite - sex couples are morally superior to same - sex couples			1
" constitutionally , in a country that guarantees all @entity238 " equal protection " of the laws , that is unacceptable			0
given all these detailed evidentiary findings that follow ineluctably from the marriage opponents ' failure to put on much of a case at all , and given @entity36 's finding that @entity8 violated two separate constitutional provisions -- the due process and equal protection clauses -- it will be extremely difficult for an appellate court , following well - established rules of deference to lower court findings , to reverse			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			2

@entity255 says political arguments do n't *necessarily* hold up in court
opponents of same - sex marriage won the political battle on @entity8 , she notes
but when they had to defend the law in court , they could n't come up with evidence , she says
based on opponents ' lack of a case , the *verdict* will be *upheld* , she says
