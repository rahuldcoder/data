nothing goes to waste , not even the bones			2
following this tradition , a youth group in @entity0 's @entity11 slum is making beautiful jewelry out of discarded bones from cows and goats			1
under their brand name " @entity19 " the group has an innovative way of making a living by dealing with waste management -- a huge problem in urban areas			1
" if you walk around here you will see the garbage is thrown almost everywhere , " says @entity25 , founder of @entity19			1
" as a team we play a big role in waste management in terms of creating a clean environment			0
" through collecting ( bones ) and recycling them , we are able to form something very nice and also to keep the environment clean			2

he cuts and sharpens the bones using a circular blade and then smooths them down with sand paper			2
the next step is boiling the bones using hydrogen peroxide to remove the oil on the bone and to make it easier for the paint to sink in			2
he then applies candle wax to the boiled bones -- the waxed part will remain white and the other part will become black when the bones are dyed			2
in the final stage , @entity40 puts the bones in a container filled with dye for an hour to enable them to have a long - lasting color			0
the jewelry is of different sizes and designs , with pieces ranging from earrings and necklaces to bracelets and rings			1
depending on the complexity of design , a piece of jewelry can take from six to 20 hours to complete			0
the group has the capacity of making 400 earrings and 150 to 200 necklaces a day depending on the order			1
