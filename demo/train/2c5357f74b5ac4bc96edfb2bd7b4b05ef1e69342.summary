-- if you love movies there is a different , and perhaps pleasingly preferable , way to spend sunday evening other than watching the @entity6 presentation			1
this will involve answering a three - part movie question			0
more on that in a moment			0
it has always been a little puzzling : why people reflexively flock to their television sets for awards programs , the @entity6 being the oldest and most prominent			1
why spend long hours watching people giving other people prizes ? if you liked some of the movies that came out last year , that 's fine and good -- but if you bought a pair of shoes that you liked last year , would you spend a sunday evening in the only life you 'll ever lead observing shoe manufacturers presenting awards to each other ? a @entity29 / @entity28 poll released last week reported that 67 % of @entity30 have n't seen any -- not even one -- of the movies nominated for @entity33 at this year 's @entity6			1
that would seem to indicate a certain indifference , yet millions of people will be sitting in front of their tv sets sunday			1
there is an alternate , and arguably more fulfilling , way for film lovers to affirm their appreciation for the magic of movies on @entity6 night			1
from the time the multitude of pre-oscars specials and red carpet coverage begins on various television channels late sunday afternoon to the time the last of the @entity52 analysis goes off the air , enough hours will pass for you to watch three feature films			1
we are in the golden age of being able to see , at home , the most outstanding movies ever made from every era of film history			2
it used to be , if you wanted to watch any movie other than what was currently in theaters , you were pretty much at the mercy of the over-the - air broadcast networks or of local stations that sometimes ran old movies very late at night			1
but today , with @entity69 , with @entity70 , with various streaming services , with @entity72 , with @entity73 , with classic - movie channels such as @entity75 , with @entity76 , with tablets , you have an unprecedented opportunity to all - but - effortlessly program your own home theater with wonderful movies from every era of cinema			2
the variety is breathtaking and endless			0
sometimes we take that for granted			0
@entity84 , before he became a television presence and was still a young newspaper movie critic , used to urge his colleagues at the paper to accompany him to a seen - better - days theater in @entity90 called the @entity91			0
it was operated by a fellow named @entity94 , who revered movies and who , every day of the year , would book a different double feature of classic , long - out - of - general - release films			1
at the beginning of every month he would mail out a leaflet with a calendar of each day 's movies ( he would describe them in rhyming couplets )			2
he selected and showed 730 movies a year ; the @entity91 was open 22 hours a day			2
it was a rare chance to immerse yourself in the best of movies from down through the generations			0
the @entity113 is long gone , but today each person has far more movie - programming choices than the @entity91 ever offered			0
you are able to routinely stumble across movies that have n't seen the inside of a theater in years , but that can jolt you with their moments of brilliance and insight into the human condition and the mysteries of the yearning heart			0
or you can just sit back and enjoy the talent and artistry in front of you ; each motion picture , by its nature , offers its own enchantments , and the fact that people today can so easily make individual choices about what to see democratizes the viewing experience in a way that simply was not possible until recent decades			0
years ago , when the idea of such choices sounded like a fantasy , i asked people to hypothetically consider what would happen if they were stranded on a desert island for the rest of their lives with only a movie projector and five films			0
what movies could they stand to watch over and over , with nothing else to keep them company ? but now the options for people deciding on their own what to view are real , and , just as significant , they 're infinite			1
so , as the @entity6 ceremonies approach , here is a cordial invitation : name the three movies that , for you , would make the perfect triple feature to watch tonight			1
movies that you 've seen during your lifetime that have meant the most to you			2
your choices do n't necessarily have to be your nomination for the three greatest or most important or influential movies ever made ( although they certainly could be )			0
just three movies that , tonight , you think would do for you the thing that movies have always done best : bring pleasure and entertainment , provoke thoughts , provide inspiration or laughter or comfort or tears			0
in other words : three movies to watch back - to - back - to - back tonight that will serve , better than the @entity6 , to remind you of why you started to love movies in the first place			1
if you 'd like , feel free to include the reasons why : what is it about your three movies that make them feel absolutely right to you ? my own triple feature for tonight ? i think i 'll go with " @entity191 , " the @entity192 starring @entity193 and @entity194 , about the power of quiet courage when it seems there 's no one in the world willing to help ; " hoosiers , " the 1986 movie starring @entity203 , about a basketball team in small - town @entity205 that triumphs over every obstacle ; and " @entity213 ! " , the deliriously joyful 1996 movie written and directed by @entity207 , about a one - hit - wonder rock band from @entity209 , @entity210 , that briefly , in 1964 , makes it to the top of the charts			1
your three movies will be different			0
but if you decide to spend @entity6 night watching them , by the end of the evening you will be the one who feels rewarded			1
and you wo n't even have to stand up and thank your agent			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : why spend long hours watching people giving other people prizes ?
@entity223 : yet millions of people will watch the @entity6 show on sunday night
he says instead , pick three movies that have meant the most to you for a triple feature
@entity223 : they will remind you of why you started to love movies in the first place
