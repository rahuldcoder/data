@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 received a text message that his wife , @entity7 , and two teenage daughters , @entity9 and @entity10 , were alive in @entity11 , he was overwhelmed with relief			1

" people are becoming hostile at the missionary workers and we now find ourselves desperately trying to get them out , " said @entity37 , senior pastor of the volunteers ' home church in @entity0			1
he said he had received urgent messages from @entity11 that everyone wanted to leave			0
the @entity44 and the others from @entity46 arrived in @entity47 a week ago to help assist nearly 100 abused and abandoned children at the orphanage			1
the facility sustained heavy damage in the earthquake but no one was killed , he said			0
within hours of the quake , the volunteers became de facto nursing assistants after word spread that @entity58 was serving as a makeshift triage center			1
" lots of doctors and nurses have been coming by the facility because word 's gotten out , so there 's all these people being pulled out of rubble and they 're assisting and attending to the injured as best as they can , " @entity4 said			1
@entity69 left her husband , six daughters and five grandchildren in @entity1 when she came to @entity11 on january 8			1
moments after the walls and shelves around her collapsed , she found herself attending the injured and working to save lives , said her husband , @entity77			0
