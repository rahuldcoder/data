@entity0 , daughter of the late sen. @entity1 , was acquitted in @entity2 on friday of charges of driving under the influence of a drug			1
a jury deliberated for an hour and 10 minutes following a four - day trial that featured @entity1 's turn on the witness stand			1
after jurors left the courtroom , @entity1 friends and family members , including her 85 - year - old mother , @entity14 , applauded			1
@entity1 hugged lawyers , @entity17 and @entity18 , and , in an unusual move , shook the hands of the prosecutors			1
as people filed out of courtroom , @entity1 told reporters she was not angry with the prosecutors who brought the case			1
the 54 - year - old former wife of @entity2 gov. @entity29 faced a charge of driving while impaired after swerving off the road in her @entity32 and careening into a tractor - trailer on a @entity2 interstate in morning rush - hour traffic in july 2012			1
outside court , @entity1 said she was " unbelievably grateful			1
" @entity18 suggested that the prosecution pursued the case because of her name			1
" you 've got to wonder why an ill - advised prosecution like this was brought , " the attorney said			1
" is it because of who the defendant is ? they concede that it was an accident and nevertheless they brought this case			2
i find this very depressing			0
" in a statement friday , the @entity56 district attorney 's office said : " we prosecute 2,500 impaired driving cases annually in @entity56			1
this case was treated no differently from any of the others			2
the jury heard all the evidence in this case and we respect their verdict			2
" @entity1 testified this week that she grabbed the wrong prescription bottle from her kitchen counter that morning and swallowed 10 milligrams of zolpidem , a sleep aid also known by the brand name @entity71			1
neither she nor prosecutors disputed the fact that she drove erratically after taking the medication and sideswiped a tractor - trailer in @entity56 before she was found , slumped over her steering wheel , her car stalled			0
" i now know thanks to the tox lab that i must have taken the sleeping medication by mistake , " said @entity1 , looking at the jury as she testified			1
@entity1 said she made cappuccino , had some carrots , prepared bags for the gym and office and had no problem leaving her apartment and getting to her vehicle the morning of the accident			1
her memory from that morning ends just before she entered the highway , @entity1 said			1
the next thing she recalls is a knock on the window of her suv , and a man she thought was a police officer asking if she was ok			0
" i was confused by that because i thought i was fine , " she said on the stand			0
during a contentious cross examination , @entity1 insisted that she would not have stayed behind the wheel if she 'd felt the effects of the medication			1
" if i 'd realized i was impaired , i would have pulled over , " she told prosecutor @entity105 , and also said she does n't know what the side effects of zolpidem might feel like			2
" you 've taken this pill for 10 years and you ca n't tell me whether or not it makes you feel tired after you take it ? " @entity113 asked			0
" i guess i do n't really think about how i 'm feeling when i take it , " @entity1 replied			2
" i take it , and then i 'm asleep			0
" in closing arguments , the prosecution accused @entity1 of lying to police and the public to protect her legacy			1
" she had a lot on her mind that morning			0
and she took the wrong pill by mistake , " prosecutor @entity105 told jurors			2
" however , it also makes no sense whatsoever that at no point did she realize or feel tired or dizzy or drowsy			0
that makes no sense , " she said			0
" she is responsible for the chain of events that happened after that			0
" @entity113 told jurors that @entity1 had a responsibility to pull off the road safely when she felt the effect of the drug			2
her inconsistent statements about the incident , including the claim that her doctors said she 'd had a seizure , were meant as a smokescreen , @entity113 said			0
she knew right away that she had taken the wrong pill			0
and i submit she was looking for an excuse , to avoid responsibility ... to control her public image			0
" @entity18 told jurors there 's no disputing that @entity1 ingested zolpidem and was " out of it " the morning of the crash			2
" the dispute is this : whether the prosecution has proved to you beyond a reasonable doubt that ms. @entity14 operated her vehicle while she was aware that she had ingested zolpidem and , after becoming aware , she continued intentionally to drive			0
that 's what this case is all about			0
" the jury of two women and four men began its deliberations thursday afternoon			0
they stopped for the day without reaching a verdict before resuming deliberations friday morning			0
@entity1 faced up to a year in jail if convicted .			2
