@entity0 , @entity1 -- they were the words @entity4 waited eight years to say , and when she spoke them from the witness stand wednesday , they poured out with an intensity that brought jurors to the edge of their seats			1
@entity12 was no prophet , she said			1
he was an unholy hypocrite			2
there was nothing divine about his mission to steal her in the dark of night and make her his unwilling child bride , she said			2
" he was crude and vulgar , self - serving , " she stated , looking directly at the jury			1
" he was his number one priority , followed by sex , drugs and alcohol , but he used religion in all those aspects to justify everything			2
" assistant u.s. attorney @entity31 asked how she could be so certain about @entity12 's character , and @entity33 held nothing back			1
" well , nine months of living with him and seeing him proclaim that he was @entity37 's servant and he had been called to do @entity37 's work , and everything that he did to me and to my family is something i know @entity37 would never tell someone to do , " she said			1
'' @entity37 would never tell someone to kidnap a young girl from her family 's home in the middle of the night , from her bed that she shared with her sister , from her sister 's side , and continue to rape her and sexually abuse her			1
... i know he was not called of @entity37 because @entity37 would never do something like that			1
" within minutes , @entity33 stepped down from the witness stand , ending three days of riveting testimony against the homeless street preacher accused of kidnapping her and holding her captive as his preordained " celestial " wife			1
asked if she was glad it was over , @entity33 paused for a moment , as if carefully considering her response			0
she then smiled and said , " yes			0
" @entity33 , who turned 23 last week , led the jury through the ordeal she calls " my nine months in hell			2
" she was 14 when she was snatched from her bed at knifepoint and marched into the mountains behind her home to a makeshift camp , where @entity12 " sealed " her to him as his wife			1
other kidnapped girls were to come , she said @entity12 told her , and her job would be to " demonstrate " to the newcomers how to carry out their sexual duties			1

" he said i would become accustomed and learn to love it , " she said wednesday			2
" he said he understood and recognized that i felt like a prostitute or a concubine or a second - class wife but that was n't the case at all			1
" although @entity12 claimed to receive revelations directly from @entity37 and said he was destined for celestial glory , many of the details of his life , as described by @entity33 , were earthly and banal			1
@entity12 and @entity85 constantly squabbled over her jealousy and his drinking , @entity33 said			1
he had a taste for pornography and boasted about his sexual prowess and his ability to outsmart other people			0
when he talked about his " ministry , " he meant panhandling , @entity33 added			0
but @entity12 often was scathing in his criticism of the people who gave him money on the street			1
she said he talked constantly -- about himself			2
she never saw him show compassion , or give anyone else money or food			0
except for concealing her identity , she said , he did n't show much concern for her or her family			0
" he said that i was the apple of their eye and that they were heartbroken i was n't there but that they would be comforted and reassured that i was in good hands , " she said			0
@entity12 , 57 , has not been in court during @entity33 's testimony			1
as he has during every court appearance since december 2004 , @entity12 closed his eyes and began singing hymns as soon as he was brought into court on wednesday			1
in what has become a daily ritual , @entity142 district judge @entity141 brought the jury in , and intoned : " mr. @entity12 , you have a constitutional right to be here , which you now waive if you continue to sing			1
" in his thin , reedy voice , @entity12 went on singing about the crucifixion of @entity150 : " they pierced his hands and feet and side ... " he was led from the courtroom , still singing with his hands folded as if in prayer beneath his chest - length beard			1
according to court records , he stops the moment he enters a room equipped with audio and video feeds that allow him to view the trial			2
his lawyers do n't dispute what happened to smart but say @entity12 was insane , and therefore not criminally responsible for his actions			2
they speak of delusions that their client said provided revelations			0
defense attorney @entity170 was gentle in his brief cross-examination of @entity33 , mainly clarifying small points about her direct testimony			0
asked about a statement she gave to a forensic psychologist shortly after she was found in march 2003 , @entity33 conceded that her memory was probably better back then			0
she crisply thanked the lawyer for refreshing her memory on another point			0
@entity33 was followed by several other prosecution witnesses			0

the witness said the man told her @entity33 had been found			0
when she disputed his statement , he said he 'd read the news in a competing paper , she testified			2

he 'd been called to investigate a tip that @entity33 was there , but said he considered it a " long shot			0
" the women were dressed in robes and veils and were not permitted to speak , he said he asked to look under the younger woman 's veil , but the man was insistent that he could n't			0
it would violate their religion , the man said , he seemed adamant and not at all evasive or nervous , @entity216 told the jury			0
he did not appear to be mentally ill. " my impression was that he belonged to a religion or a cult that i had never heard of , " he said			0
