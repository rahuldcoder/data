-- @entity2 's toxicology report is out and now we know the 19 - year - old had a blood - alcohol level that was more than twice the legal limit for driving			1
this would explain why , according to her family , she was involved in a single - car accident			0
however , it does not explain why @entity10 shot her in the face			2
@entity2 's family says she was seeking help after the crash and knocked on the door of @entity10 's house in @entity18 , @entity19 , a suburb of @entity20			1
the 54 - year - old wafer , who is white , told investigators he feared @entity2 , who is black , was trying to break in			1
there are too many unanswered questions to know exactly what happened that night			0
but we do know this : if a black man told police officers " self - defense " was the reason why he shot an unarmed white teenage girl in the face with his shotgun , it would not have taken protests , national media attention and nearly two weeks for authorities to reject that excuse			1
and this is why @entity2 's death -- ruled a homicide after protests and national media attention -- draws comparisons to that of @entity47 , the @entity49 teen shot and killed by @entity50 , who is of white and @entity52 heritage , last year			1
not that the events leading up to their shootings are identical			0
but statistics show the benefit of doubt granted to those who have spilled black blood is not extended as graciously when roles are reversed			2
in other words , if someone told you a black man stalked , confronted and eventually murdered an unarmed white teenage boy , it 's doubtful " self - defense " would get him off the hook			1
and it should n't , because that sounds ridiculous			0
but when the victim is black , the narrative that has historically characterized blacks as a menace -- the narrative that gets supported by out - of - context crime statistics , pop culture imagery and media coverage -- assigns culpability and thus plausibility			2
on friday , @entity10 was finally charged with second - degree murder , manslaughter and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony			0
we 're finally on the road to finding out the truth , and perhaps even achieving justice for @entity2			2
but will another high - profile , racially charged murder trial get us any closer to debunking the strain of thinking that places " fear for one 's life " and an unarmed , dead black person in the same scenario far too often ? this is the same idea that says it 's completely reasonable for the @entity104 to continue to " stop and frisk " â € ” a practice that disproportionately targets black people , despite its resulting in confiscation of a gun one - tenth of one percent of the time			1
it 's the idea that says two police officers , who fired 15 shots at an unarmed , 60 - year - old black man in his own driveway , are the victims			1
it 's the idea that says there 's no need to quickly make an arrest -- even though @entity2 's unarmed body is lying in a pool of blood and the nearby weapon is still warm -- because the killer may have " acted as a reasonable person would who was in fear for his life , " as @entity131 , the lawyer of the alleged shooter , claims			1
between 2005 and 2010 , an @entity137 study , using @entity135 data , found that white - on - black shootings were found to be justified 11.5 % of the time in states that do n't have stand - your - ground laws and 17 % of the time in those that do -- the highest among all combinations			2
black - on - white homicides were ruled to be justified 1 % of the time in stand - your - ground states and even less frequently in states without the law			2
now , obviously statistics do n't reveal the circumstances surrounding each shooting , but they do reinforce the narrative that black people are inherently more dangerous			0
thus @entity153 police were found " justified " in killing a black , unarmed 19 - year - old college student who was falsely accused of robbery			2
@entity157 police who shot and killed an unarmed black , autistic 27 - year - old did so " in defense of their lives " according to their attorneys			1
it 's the same fear that led four police officers to fire 41 shots at an unarmed black man on the stoop of his @entity172 apartment in 1999 , hitting him 19 times			1
it 's the same fear that led an officer to shoot and kill an unarmed 24 - year - old black man who , like @entity2 , was reportedly in a single car accident and went out looking for help earlier this year			1
you can tell yourself all these stories are just tragic one - offs if it makes you feel better			0
parents of black children do n't have the luxury			0
sure , there are plenty of examples of blacks committing crimes but how does that justify pre-emptive strikes ? how does that make substituting " open season " with " self - defense " , ok ? i remember something former @entity197 player @entity196 once told me : " a lot of upper - middle - class black people hear reports about a black athlete and assume he 's guilty			1
... if he 's innocent , they 'll see it more as a special case than the norm			0
" this attitude extends to society as a whole			0
assuming black people are inherently up to no good is not just something some white people are guilty of			2
there are blacks who are leery of blacks as well			0
that is the power of the narrative			0
that is the subtlety of institutionalized racism			0
it does n't wear a hood or burn crosses in a yard			0
rather it 's the subconscious element of our culture that looks at a black corpse and quietly puts it , instead of the perpetrator , on trial			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			0

@entity2 , black teen , was shot dead after knocking on a white **homeowner** 's door
@entity240 says she needed help ; **homeowner** says he feared she was breaking in
@entity244 : if a black man said he shot unarmed white girl in the face in " self defense " he would be in jail
@entity244 : our culture " looks at a black corpse and puts it , instead of the perpetrator , on trial "
