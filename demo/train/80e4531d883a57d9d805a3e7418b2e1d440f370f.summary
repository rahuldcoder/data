it took six grueling years			2
but finally , @entity2 took the chance to look the @entity5 people in the eye and declare job done			1
in his @entity9 address tuesday night -- more a lofty campaign style rallying call than a traditional plodding policy lecture -- @entity2 declared he had delivered on what voters first elected him to do : conquering a " vicious " economic crisis and ending ground wars in the @entity16			1
" tonight , we turn the page , " the president said in his address to a joint session of @entity20 , trying to make an emphatic break with a turbulent 15 - year period when twin shocks from terrorism and financial meltdowns rocked the nation			2
" the shadow of crisis has passed , " he said			0
" for the first time in a @entity9 address it sounded like he meant it			0
the loose and combative @entity2 who @entity5 saw on tuesday night was not the graying , crisis - stifled president who last year seemed weary of his job and failed to mount an effective defense of @entity39 as the party lost the @entity41 in november			1
there was no sign of contrition , or even an indication he felt at all bloodied by the disastrous mid-terms , in which @entity39 lost control of the @entity41			0
instead , riding a tide of unexpected momentum which has even surprised @entity51 aides , @entity2 shoved back in the game by wielding executive powers on issues like @entity55 and immigration to prove he is still a political force in @entity58			1
" i have no more campaigns to run , " he said drawing @entity60 applause , before silencing his foes with a kicker that encapsulates his attitude to an opposition party with which he has feuded for his entire presidency			0
" i know -- because i won them both			2
" " middle class economics " he said the " verdict is clear " that his brand of " middle class economics " works , and promised to wield his veto against any @entity60 attempt to roll back reforms on health care and the financial industry			0
in exactly two years , @entity2 will be out of the @entity51			1
but he could not resist offering a pointer for a @entity79 who wants to succeed him -- presumably @entity81 , pushing new doctrines of " middle class economics " and " smarter " @entity16 policy which would keep @entity85 at bay and spare @entity5 soldiers from foreign quagmires			1
@entity2 's claim of a new era of prosperity at home and security abroad angered @entity60			1
potential candidates blast tax proposals @entity96 , an old @entity2 foe mulling another shot at the @entity51 accused the president of a lack of leadership			1
" more intent on winning elections than on winning progress , he ignores the fact that the country has elected a @entity20 that favors smaller government and lower taxes , " @entity96 said on @entity102			2
with fear of homegrown jihadists stalking the @entity113 , from @entity114 to @entity115 and @entity116 to @entity117 , @entity2 critics say he was in denial over a failing strategy to take on global terrorism			1
@entity2 did not mention @entity121 at all			1
and he only referred to the attacks on the @entity124 satirical magazine @entity123 in passing			0
" we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists -- from a school in @entity134 to the streets of @entity114 , " @entity2 said , but gave no indication that the sudden eruption of home grown jihadism would change his national security strategy			1
@entity2 cuts loose during speech " instead of sending large ground forces overseas , we 're partnering with nations from @entity139 to @entity140 to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten @entity5 , " he said			1
focus on economy , not terror potential @entity60 presidential candidate sen. @entity145 warned that " saying wars are over is n't enough to keep us safe			0
" and even as he declared one era of foreign wars over , the president asked @entity20 to give him backing to wage another -- albeit the arms length clash using mainly air power -- against @entity85			0
@entity2 's aides said the president saw his address not as a chance to unveil the usual laundry list of programs -- but to tell a " new story " about a presidency which has unfolded in times of crisis at home and abroad			1
@entity60 skeptical of @entity2 's call for unity his appearance , six years on from the cold january day in 2009 when he took the oath of office , coincided with a cluster of political turning points			1
for the first time in a @entity9 address tuesday , @entity2 , the most liberal president since @entity175 , stood up in the @entity176 and stared out at the members of two chambers which are now both controlled by @entity60			1
it was a reminder that despite two crushing presidential victories , @entity2 's two terms also included two bitter mid-term rebukes from voters			1
economic milestones but with unemployment down to 5.6 percent , with the economy churning out several hundred thousand jobs a month , and with growth accelerating , @entity2 may have reached a political milestone			1
for years , the president has got little credit for restoring an economy that was shedding 700,000 jobs a month when he took office			0
that 's partly because the results of the rebound have been so uneven			0
while the stock market has soared , many in the @entity200 have been left behind			0
wages are stagnant and many of the new jobs created pay less and have fewer benefits than the ones that are gone			0
still , there is a sense now that the benefits of the recovery are spreading , and low gas prices are restoring a half forgotten sense of well being for many @entity5			2
" with a growing economy , shrinking deficits , bustling industry and booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on @entity222 , " @entity2 said			2
" it 's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years , and for decades to come			0
" a @entity227 / @entity226 poll released tuesday showed that 45 percent of @entity5 were now very or somewhat satisfied with the @entity5 economy , and the trend is rising			0
the percentage of those who believe @entity5 is in decline has dropped to its lowest level since the crisis			0
the country now seems 50 - 50 split on that issue			0
" this is a president who for whatever reason , woke up and saw the economic numbers and saw he had a pretty strong hand , and he is going to start playing some cards right now , " said @entity238 , a professor who specializes in the presidency at @entity240 @entity2 's own political fortunes are rising as a result			1
a @entity250 poll has him at 50 percent , his highest rating for nearly two years			0
other surveys confirm the rebound , but place @entity2 in the high 40s -- still heady territory for a president shellacked in the mid-term elections			1
confronting new threats the sense that @entity2 is confronting an important political moment also played out as he addressed foreign policy			1
after years of telling @entity5 that the tide of war is receding , @entity2 is being forced to confront an alarming new manifestation of violent jihadism in @entity266 , which many officials fear could soon make its way to the streets of the @entity5			1
@entity5 warplanes are in the skies over @entity272 again , following the sudden rise of @entity85			0
up to 3,000 troops have been sent back to the country just years after @entity2 told @entity5 the war was over			1
splintering states in the @entity16 including @entity278 and @entity279 are offering new safe havens for terror groups with the @entity5 in their sights			0
@entity2 made the case for a focused but " smarter " campaign against @entity85 , but took time to rebut criticisms by @entity60 like @entity286 and @entity287 who believe he is too slow to use force abroad			1
" when we make rash decisions , reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads , when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military -- then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts , " @entity2 said			2
the back end of a presidency the speech also marked a moment of valediction			0
barring some great national political crisis , tuesday 's appearance may have been the last time when @entity2 took the stage as @entity5 's most important voice for liberalism			2
when @entity308 announces what is seen as her almost certain presidential campaign later this year , she will likely become the go - to voice for progressives on all domestic issues			0
and by the time of the @entity9 address next year , the presidential primary season will be in full swing -- drawing media attention from the lame duck in the @entity51			0
@entity319 , chief speechwriter for former vice president @entity320 , said that @entity2 had long term political goals in mind as he knew almost nothing he proposed would get passed			2
" but he is laying the groundwork for whoever it is in 2016 to run against a @entity60 , " said @entity319 , now a professor at @entity325			0
apparently sensing his time is short , @entity2 mounted an extraordinary defense of his own political skills , even referring to the speech in @entity333 he made as an unknown senatorial candidate at the @entity335 in 2004			2
" over the past six years , the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency has n't delivered on this vision , " @entity2 said arguing that many people thought he was naive			2
" i know how tempting such cynicism may be			0
but i still think the cynics are wrong , " @entity2 said , in a plea for a " better politics " that will likely remain unfulfilled , in one of the biggest disappointments of his presidency .			2
