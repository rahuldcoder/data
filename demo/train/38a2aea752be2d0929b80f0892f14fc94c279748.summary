how was @entity1 math teacher @entity0 killed ? with a box cutter the suspect , 14 - year - old @entity5 , had brought into school , a source close to the investigation says			1
what happened to her body afterward ? it was stashed in a recycling bin , rolled outside , then dumped about 20 feet into woods behind the northeastern @entity15 high school 's athletic fields , adds another source			1
it was left there -- not buried , not even covered			2
and where did the alleged killer go afterward ? after changing his clothes , he went to a @entity23 's fast food restaurant and a movie , sources say , before police in a neighboring town saw him walking on a busy road under the pitch - dark sky early wednesday			2
those are the answers , many of them revealed thursday , two days after the teacher 's killing			0
yet the question of why this happened -- why a popular young educator who always wore a smile and went the extra mile was killed allegedly by a teenager who friends , family and co-workers described as reserved and well - behaved -- continues to loom large			2
@entity5 , who had moved to the @entity47 suburb of @entity48 before the start of the school year , remained jailed without bond thursday			1
a grand jury will play a big part in deciding his next step : if they indict him for first - or second - degree murder , he -- like any juvenile age 14 or older -- would be tried as an adult , based on @entity15 law			0
meanwhile , the tight - knit @entity62 community is still trying to make sense of what he allegedly did and of life without a teacher who so many appreciated , learned from and loved			0
" it 's just surreal how quickly someone can go , and how much we take for granted every day , " said @entity1 student @entity68			2
" ( @entity0 was ) the nicest teacher you could ever have			1
i ca n't believe it			0
" two missing persons ' reports come together students and colleagues described the 24 - year - old @entity0 as someone who gave everything for her students -- be it a pat on the back , a sensible explanation to a tricky concept , or the time , effort and heart to work through problems , math or otherwise , with them			1
one of those students was @entity5 , a freshman			1
he 'd been doodling and listening to music during his @entity94 in the school 's final period , classmate @entity92 told @entity97			1
creating such drawings was unusual for @entity5 , who @entity92 recalled rarely participated in class discussions but was " a really good student			1
" when the final bell sounded at 1:55 p.m. tuesday , @entity0 asked him to stay after class , according to @entity92 , who sat two desks over from @entity5			1
while shuttling between two afterschool meetings , @entity92 said she looked into the same classroom and saw @entity0 standing by her computer and @entity5 sitting in a chair about five to 10 feet away			1
the teacher smiled at her , @entity92 recalled			0
at some point that afternoon , @entity0 went to a regular students ' girls bathroom on @entity117 's second floor , as someone was in the locked faculty bathroom , a source close to the investigation said			1
@entity5 allegedly followed her in			1
there , @entity0 was punched a few times before being killed with a box cutter around 3:30 p.m. , said a source			1
her body went into a recycling bin , then outside the school where it was tossed			1
authorities eventually found a bin that apparently had been thrown off an embankment some 100 feet away from @entity0 's body , a source said			1
before police found her -- before they even knew she was missing -- they 'd started looking for @entity5			1
this was in the early evening , with @entity135 tweeting to residents that he had n't returned home and was last seen around the @entity140 movie theater in the town some 20 miles northeast of @entity47			0
while they were looking for him , police got a call around 11:20 p.m. tuesday about another missing person : @entity0			2
she was n't home either , nor had she answered her phones			0
the stories started coming together about an hour later , when police officers in nearby @entity149 found @entity5 walking along @entity150			1
whatever he told detectives in his subsequent interviews , whatever they saw in surveillance footage from the school , led to @entity5 's arrest for murder			1
it also led them to @entity0 's body in the woods			1
read the complaint a quiet and normal student @entity5 is a quiet young man , those who know him said			1
he excelled at soccer and made a harmless impression			0
" he ... seemed quiet and reserved , but he just seemed normal , " said @entity166 , who was in @entity5 's @entity168 class			1
@entity5 did n't drink or do drugs , and he came from a good family , one of his closest friends said			2
he described @entity174 as a good athlete who was shy at first but eventually warmed up to people , adding that he had n't been acting strangely lately			0
friends got their first hint that something was awry when @entity5 did n't show up for soccer practice tuesday			2
the team set out to look for him after seeing texts that he was missing			0
he was a newcomer to @entity48 , a town of about 26,000 people			0
his family had bounced around , and he had lived in different cities in @entity188 and @entity189 since he was in fourth grade , authorities in those states said			0
a teacher who went the extra mile meanwhile , many were at a loss in @entity48 to explain the death of @entity0 -- a woman who inspired many , whether it be in the classroom or online , with her heart , intellect and positive spirit			1
" she was talking on saturday about this year was a good year			0
she was teaching freshmen for the first time			0
she was happy , " said @entity204 , @entity0 's best friend			2
" i do n't even know what the world is like without her			0
it 's a scary thought			0
" sympathy spread through the region , making its way into the baseball @entity213			0
bleachers full of fans who had assembled to watch the @entity216 take on the @entity217 observed a moment of silence in @entity0 's honor before game 1 began wednesday night at @entity47 's @entity222			2
@entity0 , a 2011 graduate of @entity223 who was working towards a master 's degree at @entity225 , seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike , said @entity229 , who became good friends with @entity0 in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school			1
" she was energetic , she was compassionate , " @entity229 said			0
" you could n't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend			0
" @entity225 issued a statement lamenting @entity0 's death			2
" she believed children have much to offer and often do not realize how special they are as individuals , " the university said			0
" in her application to @entity225 she said she was dedicated to ' helping students in times of need			0
' " @entity0 was known to take to @entity245 to dole out homework assignments and wisdom to her students			2
" no matter what happens in life , be good to people , " she wrote in august			0
" being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind			0
" debate unfolds after teacher slayings in @entity255 , @entity15			0

@entity0 asked @entity5 , who 'd been doodling , to stay after a class , student says
