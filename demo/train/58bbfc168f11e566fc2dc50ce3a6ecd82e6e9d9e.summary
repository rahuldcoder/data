when it comes to mathematics , reading and science , young people in @entity1 are the best in the world , according to a global education survey released tuesday			1
in all three subjects , @entity1 students demonstrated knowledge and skills equivalent to at least one additional year of schooling than their peers in countries like the @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity18			1
the findings are part of the 2012 @entity21 ( or @entity21 ) -- a leading survey of education systems conducted every three years by the @entity25 - based @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , a grouping of the world 's richest economies			1
more than half a million students , aged 15 and 16 , sat a two - hour exam last year as part of the study			1
the pupils came from 65 countries representing 80 % of the global economy			1
east @entity36 economies performed best overall , claiming seven of the top 10 places across all three subjects			1
in math , @entity1 had the highest score with 613 points -- the equivalent of nearly three years of schooling above the average for the 34 @entity24 member countries of 494 , and six years above @entity45 which ranked last with a score of 368			1
the city also came top in 2009 rankings			0
@entity49 came second in mathematics with a score of 573 , followed by @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , and @entity55			0
but the math performance of most countries has not improved since the @entity21 tests were launched more than a decade ago			1
around 60 % of the 64 countries who participated in previous studies performed at the same level or worse in 2012 , and nearly a third of all students scored in the lowest band for the subject			2
try the @entity67 @entity16 lags the @entity16 ranked 36th , performing below the @entity24 average in mathematics with 481 points , and a score indistinguishable from the average for reading and science			1
the @entity18 did slightly better , ranking 26th , equaling the average score for @entity24 countries in math and reading			1
the @entity18 performed above average in science with a score of 514			1
part of the reason pupils do so well in @entity1 , according to the @entity24 's deputy director of education , @entity83 , is that they have the drive and confidence to fulfill their potential			2
" in @entity90 and @entity1 , you have nine out of 10 students telling you , ' it depends on me			2
if i invest the effort , my teachers are going to help me to be successful ' , " @entity83 told @entity95 's @entity94 program , which will air later this month			0
similarly , in @entity99 -- which ranked 7th overall -- more than 80 % of students disagreed or strongly disagreed that they put off difficult problems , and 68 % disagreed or strongly disagreed that they give up easily when confronted with a problem			0
hard work " practice and hard work go a long way towards developing each student 's potential , but students can only achieve at the highest levels when they believe that they are in control of their success and that they are capable of achieving at high levels , " the @entity21 report said			0
@entity21 tests students near the end of their compulsory education in areas that are " essential for full participation in modern society , " as well as their ability to apply what they have learned in new situations			0
" this approach reflects the fact that modern economies reward individuals not for what they know , but for what they can do with what they know , " the report said			0
in reading , @entity36 economies also topped the league table			1
@entity1 ranked first , with a score of 570 -- the equivalent of one and a half years more schooling than the @entity24 average			1
@entity52 ranked second , followed by @entity49 , @entity99 and @entity54			0
half the countries that took part in previous assessments saw an improvement in reading comprehension since 2003			2
@entity1 also topped the list in science , with a score of 580 compared to the average of 501 -- the equivalent of nearly two more years of schooling			1
in fifth place , @entity151 was the top performing country outside @entity153 , behind @entity52 , @entity49 and @entity99			0
data on other @entity90 provinces and cities is not yet published by @entity21 because not enough regions take part in the tests to be considered representative , a spokesman said			0
however , @entity90 as a whole is expected to be included in the 2015 assessment			0
@entity1 has been at the forefront of education reforms in the country in recent years			2
@entity167 learning ? @entity1 's outstanding performance defies preconceptions about @entity90 's education system being based on rote learning , according to @entity83			2
" the biggest surprise from @entity1 ... was not that students did well on reproducing subject matter content but that they were very , very good in those higher order skills ( that reflect ) what you can do with what you know , " he said			2
around one in four @entity1 students performed in the top two reading bands compared to the average with just under one in 10			1
@entity186 , deputy principal at the @entity187 in @entity188 , told @entity95 that @entity1 's education system invests in teaching staff by offering training and high salaries			2
" the teachers are very well - paid , very professional , " @entity186 said			0
" the @entity1 government will spend a lot of resources in making sure that each teacher is well trained , has opportunities to go abroad , ( and ) has opportunities to learn from the best teachers			0
" other countries whose performance improved in @entity21 this year , such as @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 , have implemented policies to raise the quality of teaching staff by increasing requirements for education licenses , providing incentives for high - achieving students to enter the profession and ongoing on - the - job training , according to the report			1
@entity186 also told @entity95 that @entity1 's success is a product of a culture that prioritizes academic achievements over other pursuits			0
" a lot of it is that the students are engaged in learning			0
the parents , the students , the community are engaged in making sure their child succeeds , " he said .			0
