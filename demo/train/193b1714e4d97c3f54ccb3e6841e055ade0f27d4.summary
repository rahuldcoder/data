" @entity35 is the most typical @entity24 tradition			2
there are historical pictures of people drinking to the point where they ca n't go on anymore , " says @entity37			0

still , in many villages in the country 's north , the ancient rites are still celebrated			1
one of the oldest rituals is called @entity76 , and involves local virgins gathering water from the sea			0
the village 's unmarried women all place a personal belonging in the pot and leave it under a fig tree overnight , where -- folklore has it -- the magic of the day imbues the objects with prophetic powers , and the girls in question dream of their future husbands			1
the next day , all the women in the village gather , and take turns pulling out objects and reciting rhyming couplets that are meant to predict the romantic fortunes of the item 's owner			1
these days , however , the festival is more an excuse for the community of women to exchange bawdy jokes			1

it used to be that young , unmarried women would float floral wreaths in the river where eager bachelors on the other side would try to catching the flowers			0
according to @entity140 folklore , the man and woman in question would become a couple			0
bonfires are also a large feature of the holiday , and it 's tradition for a couple to leap through the flames together while holding hands -- if they do n't let go , it is said their love will last			2
