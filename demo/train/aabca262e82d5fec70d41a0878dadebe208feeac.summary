-- president @entity3 of @entity4 will attend the @entity6 summit meeting about @entity7 in @entity8 this weekend , his office said in a statement thursday			1
@entity6 had invited @entity3 to the conference on tuesday , just days after the organization 's secretary general , @entity11 , had suggested that the neighbor of @entity7 would not be included because of the continued closure of @entity4 's border with @entity7 to war supplies			1
the decision to attend the meeting was made in consultation with @entity4 's top military and civilian leaders , the statement from @entity3 's office said			0
tensions between @entity4 and @entity26 forces operating in @entity7 have been high since @entity6 airstrikes killed two dozen @entity4 soldiers in november			1
the closure of the border with @entity7 to @entity6 supply routes was one of the measures @entity34 employed to show its displeasure over the airstrikes			1
talks to reopen the border have intensified ahead of the @entity8 meetings			0
@entity40 negotiators have been in @entity4 since late april , and this past weekend , gen. @entity41 , who oversees all @entity40 and @entity6 troops in @entity7 , and his @entity7 counterpart were in @entity4 for discussions that included talks about the border situation			1
analysts have described the @entity6 summit invitation as an incentive for @entity3 to reopen the routes			1
but @entity51 , a spokesman for @entity3 , said tuesday that the invitation to the meeting was unconditional and was not linked to the opening of ground lines of communication for @entity6 or to any other issue			2
senior @entity4 military and civilian officials met in @entity34 tuesday evening but did not come up with a recommendation on lifting the blockade on the two @entity6 supply routes through @entity4			1
the summit meeting will include @entity7 president @entity64 , along with @entity6 allies and @entity67 contributors			1
there also will be representatives from @entity70 , @entity71 and key international organizations including the @entity73 and @entity74			0
@entity3 will make a speech in @entity8 and also meet with various international leaders on the margins of the summit , his office said thursday			0
a senior official with the @entity83 administration had stressed earlier in the week that the invitation to @entity4 was from @entity6 and that it was not clear if president @entity83 would meet with @entity3			1
" it does n't necessarily impact what we do with the @entity4 " at the summit , the official said			0
@entity83 met with @entity4 prime minister @entity90 in march during a nuclear security summit in @entity92 , @entity93			0
@entity94 , former @entity4 ambassador to the @entity40 and now residing in @entity40 , told @entity0 thursday that the two countries have " parallel narratives			2
" " @entity4 think that the @entity40 is an untrustworthy ally ; the @entity40 think that @entity4 's do n't always fulfill their end of the bargain , especially when it comes to terrorism , " @entity94 said			1
ending the deadlock wo n't be easy , he said			0
" remember , we need to crack down on these extremists for @entity4 's sake			0
more @entity4 have been killed by them than they have killed @entity40			2
... @entity40 will leave @entity7 someday			2
but we will still be haunted by the remnants , " he said			0
hampering any honest discussion between @entity4 and the @entity40 , he said , is " a small group of people ideologically motivated and seeking essentially the domination of an @entity116 ideology within @entity4 , but unable to get votes			2
" @entity0 's @entity118 contributed to this report .			0

@entity123 : " @entity4 think that the @entity40 is an untrustworthy ally , " former ambassador says
@entity6 wants @entity4 to reopen supply routes to @entity7
@entity34 is still upset about @entity6 airstrikes that killed @entity4 soldiers
the @entity4 president has nonetheless accepted an invitation to a @entity6 summit
