in november of last year , 19 - year - old @entity0 gave her father , @entity1 , a long hug goodbye			1
he remembers , he says , because she looked especially beautiful			2
he remarked upon it to his wife , saying there was something different about his daughter			2
the night before , she had asked her sisters to sleep together in one big bed			2
@entity0 gave a lingering farewell to her bedridden grandmother , and that 's when @entity13 , her mother , knew something was wrong			1
standing in her daughter 's empty bedroom , @entity13 told @entity17 , " there was something about the way she said ' @entity22 ' ( @entity23 ) while taking leave that day , which made us all wonder			1
my husband even asked if everything was ok , and i said she is fine			2
" four days later , @entity0 called her parents back in @entity30 , just as she was crossing into @entity31 from its border with @entity34			1

" there was nothing they ( @entity0 's parents ) could have done different			1
she was a bedroom radical			1
and if this could happen to @entity65 , who had all the life chances , the best education that money can buy , a family that was moderate , liberal ... if it could happen to her , somebody who was so intelligent , then it could happen to any family , " @entity56 said			2
@entity0 is said to be influenced by watching sermons online and coming in contact with people through social media that helped her make the trek from @entity78 to @entity31			1
living the dream in @entity30 the @entity81 family was , in many ways , living the dream of many immigrants			1

' i do n't know when she became this brave ' " she did n't like shouting			0
i do n't know when she became this brave			0
she was scared to talk , scared to fly , and this is a very big step -- her flying to @entity31			1
i ca n't believe this , " @entity141 says , explaining the shock the family feels about her daughter 's decision			1
" i know she is my daughter , but i feel that she is my friend			0
but she made one mistake , but otherwise , she is really a very good girl			0

they do n't let a girl stay alone			0
now we have to find a mahram ( male guardian )			0
we have to get married here			2
" but her parents , still worried , attempted to dissuade her			2
" we used to tell her ... this is not @entity43 , some of these groups are not @entity43			0
they are doing wrong things which we do n't approve of			0
obviously , no @entity170 approves this			0
" @entity41 vs. mainstream @entity43 : the media battle despite @entity0 's active role on social media , her father says he reads little of what she writes online because it hurts him			1
" we do n't know what happened and how she changed so quickly			0

" both parents are quick to denounce @entity41 , which also calls itself the " @entity221 , " and the atrocities that are being carried out in the name of religion			1
'' we are against all this @entity41 carrying on			1
any killing we are against , whoever it is			0
that 's what we have been taught by our prophet -- peace be upon him , " @entity1 says			1
@entity56 , the lawyer , says @entity65 is not directly responsible for committing any crimes and is safe to return home			2
the @entity81 family says they are speaking out in the hope that their other children and the community do n't face any backlash , and they publicly condemn their eldest daughter 's callous decision			2
