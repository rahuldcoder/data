@entity0 -- during his 2000 presidential run , a @entity3 voter asked @entity6 sen. @entity5 who he might choose as secretary of defense			1
@entity5 responded by tossing out the name of a dear old friend and colleague , the very man who would be nominated to that post by a @entity13 and frequent @entity5 target 13 years later			2
" there 's a lot of people that could do that , " he told voters at a january town hall in @entity16 , @entity3			0
" one of ' em , i think , is sen. @entity22			0
" now @entity23 has been nominated for that same job , by @entity5 's 2008 campaign rival , president @entity25			1
but when the @entity26 meets on thursday to discuss the nomination , @entity5 will be one of @entity23 's biggest skeptics			1
what @entity23 will say thursday " my biggest concern is his overall attitude about the @entity35 , our role in the world -- particularly in the @entity38 and whether we should reduce the @entity39 further -- but mainly his general overall world view , " @entity5 told @entity1 's @entity30 about his former colleague			1
to understand the depth of the fallout between the two men one needs to understand how close the senators once were			0
@entity5 loaned his star power to @entity23 's first @entity26 campaign in 1996 , traveling to appear with him in @entity47			1
when @entity23 was elected to the @entity26 , the two men shared a bond over their service in @entity50			0
in 1997 they attended a ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of the @entity53			0
speaking about his comrades in arms , @entity5 mentioned the " unique bond that exists between us of which i am eternally proud			0
" " when i see them on the floor of the @entity26 or somewhere in the @entity60 , i feel a little lift , " he said			0
@entity23 spoke of @entity5 's service , declaring " no one during this entire time ever gave more , or showed more courage , than @entity5			1
" five things @entity23 may be asked about their friendship led to a close working relationship during the 2000 presidential campaign , when @entity23 served as a loyal surrogate and campaign co-chair for @entity5			1
then , @entity23 said his friend felt he owed the country his service			0
" his life has been committed to something larger than he is , " @entity23 said after @entity5 suspended his campaign effort to make way for an ascendent @entity79			1
" he 's a selfless person who 's given much to his country			0
" later that year , @entity23 introduced @entity5 on the stage of the party 's convention with a giant embrace			1
back in the @entity26 , the long - time friends and combat veterans both voiced early concerns about the handling of the @entity93 war			0
but their views diverged as @entity5 came to support president @entity79 's proposed troop surge in 2007 , a military decision that drew @entity23 's scorn			1
he famously called the proposal " the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since @entity50 if it is carried out			0
" why some conservatives are still going after @entity23 a source close to @entity5 said the friends just drifted apart as friends sometimes do , not because of policy differences			1
but even @entity5 acknowledged the change			0
" i 've noticed over the years that our views on the @entity35 and what we should be doing in the world have diverged rather dramatically , " he said earlier this month			0
by @entity5 's 2008 presidential run , @entity23 was more in line with @entity5 's anti-iraq war opponent @entity25			2
the two traveled together on a @entity38 @entity26 trip @entity25 used to beef up his foreign policy chops , and @entity23 was never seen on @entity5 's iconic @entity117 campaign bus			2
@entity118 : reality check for @entity23 bashers @entity23 and @entity5 spoke after the former senator 's nomination to the @entity39			1
afterward , @entity5 said he had concerns about @entity23 's positions on @entity125 , @entity93 and @entity126			1
but citing their long friendship , @entity5 said he would not oppose @entity23 before the hearing			2
" sen. @entity23 and i are , are old friends and we had a very frank and candid conversation and i 'll be looking forward to the hearing and asking questions , " @entity5 said on january 22			2
" i think that he should be given the opportunity of a hearing before any of us make a judgment			0
" @entity23 's other war			2
