@entity0 began its promised week of @entity2 hacks , assaulting a long list of targets			1
the first @entity0 hack resulted in stolen emails and credit card data from @entity8 , an @entity9 - based think tank that concentrates on security issues			1
one alleged conspirator said the goal was to use that credit card data to steal a million dollars , and give the money away as @entity2 donations , the @entity12 reports			1
online images , posted to @entity18 , show receipts from the donations			2
twitter account @entity22 , which is supposedly linked to the group , tweeted sunday that the reason it was able to steal the credit card data was because it had not been encrypted by @entity8 -- an embarrassing mistake for a company specializing in security			1
among the private clients on @entity8 's tightly - guarded list -- whose information @entity0 says it accessed -- are the @entity33 , the @entity34 and the @entity35			2
the list also includes banks , law enforcement agencies , defense contractors , and technology firms such as @entity41 and @entity42 , the @entity12 reports			0
@entity0 also posted images showing receipts of charitable donations made to non-profits			2
one theft victim , @entity47 of @entity9 , did not know his credit card data had been stolen until an @entity12 reporter called him for comment			0
" it was all charities , the @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53			0
so when the credit card company called my wife she was n't sure whether i was just donating , " @entity47 said			0
@ @entity57 tweeted that @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 were among the next targets			0
what do you think of @entity0 's ironic first target of the week ? who 's next ? update : a press release is circulating , saying that the @entity8 hack is not the work of @entity0			1
however , it is difficult to tell who is correct .			0
