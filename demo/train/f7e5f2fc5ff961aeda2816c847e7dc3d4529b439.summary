a ceasefire negotiated between rival @entity2 and @entity3 militias brought a brief respite saturday to a @entity6 town after two days of violent clashes			1
the truce between the @entity9 militia and the @entity10 in @entity11 allowed aid agencies to begin assessing the needs of the population caught in the midst of the violence			1
at the @entity19 school , where a makeshift displaced camp sprang up in september to harbor fleeing @entity2 , the numbers swelled during the clashes from around 2,500 displaced to nearly 10,000			0
the people there are in need of almost everything : food , water and shelter			0
over in a @entity31 compound where 35,000 @entity32 sought refuge from the @entity35 militias in september , the camp is more established , but water and food supplies are dwindling and there is very little shelter from the elements			2
malaria and malnutrition are all too common among the camps ' denizens			0
a tense standoff had developed earlier between the @entity9 and the regional peacekeeping force , @entity47 , after the militia threw grenades into the compound in an attempt to storm it			0
a soldier from @entity47 was killed during an exchange of fire			0
there is still no official death toll , but witnesses at the @entity19 camp told @entity59 at least 19 @entity2 were killed in what has become a spiraling cycle of retribution between the two communities			0
the @entity10 began targeting @entity2 after tens of thousands of @entity32 were forced to flee their homes as @entity9 militias marauded through the countryside			2
' extremely dire circumstances ' @entity68 overseeing a hospital in @entity11 managed by @entity70 , or @entity70 , said the aid group had worked through the violence , almost overwhelmed by the flood of patients			1
" we have been fully operational the entire time , " he said			0
" i ca n't give you any numbers right now , i 'm sorry , all i can say is it 's still ongoing			0
" but the work he and his agency do is not enough , @entity68 said			0
the @entity6 desperately needs more help from the outside world			0
" a situation where you have hundreds of thousands of people who through no fault of their own are living in extremely dire circumstances , i would hope that the international community would mobilize to provide them assistance , " he said			2
" the fact that we have n't seen it happen yet is a tragedy			0
" some help could be on the way			0
on thursday , the @entity97 unanimously approved a resolution approving military intervention in the @entity6 by an @entity101 - led force , backed by @entity103 troops , to protect civilians , restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country			1
the number of @entity101 peacekeeping troops in the country will increase to 6,000 -- up from the current 3,500 -- the @entity103 presidency said			1

the start of the @entity103 soldiers ' new operation in the @entity6 capital was announced friday morning by defense minister @entity150 on the @entity103 radio station @entity151			1
about 185 miles south of @entity11 , @entity152 has also been rocked by two days of clashes			1
many have flocked to the city 's airport , hoping to find safety there			2
" we estimate at least at 400 to 500 people have been killed so far in @entity152 and the killings continue , " @entity158 , emergencies director for @entity159 , told @entity59 saturday			0
" two hundred and eighty bodies were recovered as of yesterday , but the @entity164 tells us there are more bodies on the streets that they are working to recover			0
" @entity70 said friday that at least 92 bodies had been brought to the morgue of a hospital where its staff is working			2

opinion : why @entity6 is slipping close to catastrophe air sorties a @entity181 statement early saturday said three helicopters and hundreds more troops had arrived in @entity152			2
@entity103 troops have been out on patrol in a bid to restore calm to the city , which remains tense , as well as working to safeguard @entity103 nationals and secure the airport , the statement said			1
aerial sorties have also been launched above the capital to signal the @entity103 forces ' presence to armed forces thought to be opposed to them			2
back at the @entity31 compound in @entity11 , people scattered , screaming , as the unfamiliar boom of a low - flying jet swept over them			1
the horror soon turned to laughs of jubilation , however , with shouts of " the @entity103 ! the @entity103 ! " desperate for help from the outside world , they hoped the sonic boom was a sign from the @entity103 forces that they would soon be there too			2
