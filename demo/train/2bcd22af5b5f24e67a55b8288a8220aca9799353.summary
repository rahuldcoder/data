@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 arrived at the @entity4 long before the doors opened monday			2
he wanted to claim the first spot in line			0
as he waited in near - freezing temperatures , he skimmed a driver 's ed manual , trying to soak in last - minute details			1
" i need my license , " said @entity3 , 25			0
" when you drive without a license , you get into a lot of trouble , and i do n't want any trouble			0
" @entity3 has been granted deferred action under the @entity21 administration 's program for young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the @entity23 as children			1
but until this week , getting a driver 's license was out of reach			1
on monday , @entity1 -- the state where he now lives after coming to the @entity23 from @entity28 15 years ago --- debuted new driver 's licenses designed for those that have qualified under the federal program			1
officials originally had proposed putting a thick pink stripe on the licenses to make it clear that the holders were undocumented immigrants and not @entity23 citizens			1
but transportation officials changed course away from that idea , which some immigrant rights advocates said amounted to a discriminatory " scarlet letter			0
" the new licenses that debuted monday denote the deferred - action immigrants as " limited term " and " legal presence / no lawful status " in smaller , red letters			1
" this final design will allow for ease of implementation by keeping the coding used in the production process consistent with other licenses , " a state government spokesman said			2
the state 's transportation secretary said officials had one goal in mind			2
" this program is about accountability and safety , making our roads safer for all @entity70 , " transportation secretary @entity63 said in a written statement			0
different states , different rules for months , driver 's licenses and other state benefits have been at the heart of a battle in the nationwide immigration debate			1
supporters of licenses for undocumented immigrants argue that it 's safer to have more drivers trained and insured , and opponents argue that such systems are rife with fraud			1
in january , @entity28 gov. @entity87 said she would push to repeal the state law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver 's licenses			1
that same month , the governor of @entity93 signed a new law that would allow undocumented immigrants to get temporary licenses			1
in at least 38 states , officials have said recipients of deferred action are eligible for driver 's licenses , according to the @entity102			1
but in some states , like @entity106 and @entity107 , officials have stepped up efforts to stop licenses from being issued , the law center said			2
in @entity1 , even though the new licenses were n't the " scarlet letter " many immigrant advocates feared , some still criticized the state 's approach			1
" this new look is a huge step in the right direction , " @entity116 , staff attorney for the @entity117 of @entity1 , said in a statement			2
but @entity116 said the organization had lingering concerns			0
" we still question the necessity of including distinguishing language such as ' no lawful status ' on the licenses and will be watching closely to see how these changes are implemented , " he said			1
immigrants debate design @entity3 said he was grateful to get a license , but wished it had a different design that did n't mention his immigration status			2
" i ca n't deny that there is a lot of discrimination in this country , " he said			0
" i would rather it ( the license ) did n't have those words but there is nothing i can do			0
" @entity144 , an undocumented immigrant , said she did n't plan to get one of the new licenses , even though she would be eligible			2
" i 've been discriminated ( against ) too many times and i do n't want to give them that pleasure again , " she said			0
others said they did n't mind			0
" i have always driven illegally , so it does not bother me that they put this on it , " said @entity151 , who also waited in line at a @entity0 dmv monday			0
" because i know who i am , and am not afraid			0
" @entity158 , who was also one of the first people in line at the @entity0 office monday , said he hoped getting a driver 's license would open doors for him			1
" a license is very important to get better work , and to be treated better , " he said			0
some said they were hoping to push for all undocumented immigrants to have the chance to drive			1
@entity169 said she came to the @entity4 monday because she was the only one in her house who could get a license			0
" but my parents and others also need one , " she said , " to go to work and make a living			0
" @entity2 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
