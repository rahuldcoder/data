-- amid all the jockeying of the primary debates , president @entity2 's 2013 budget was a breath of fresh air that underscored the priorities we should have as a nation			1
sure , politicos may call it a campaign document , but even if you view it as only that , it is a much needed reminder of just what we should be focusing on			0
for @entity20 , there is plenty in this budget , especially coming on the heels of the president 's @entity26 speech a couple of weeks ago , to remind us that there is still reason to be hopeful			2
@entity2 's call for greater income equality on taxes , his focus on job creation , including focusing on key elements of his @entity36 ( supported by 78 % of @entity20 ) , his renewed call for @entity39 legislation in the @entity26 , and yes , his commitment to environmental and public health protections , as well as for the expansion of a clean energy economy			1
while not a " typical " @entity48 statement , the plan to create more clean energy jobs and more responsible energy development is just what the doctor ordered , as far as they are concerned			1
although it is down in the latest jobs numbers , @entity48 unemployment continues to hover near 11 % , and with many of the @entity48 community 's job losses stemming from the slowdown in the housing market , they need this boost now			1
interestingly enough , even just a few years ago , environmental issues did not register with @entity20 as top concerns for their families			2
majorities of @entity20 support strong environmental protections , especially since many communities happen to be in historically unsafe and polluted environs			2
so the president 's statement -- " we do n't have to choose between our environment and our economy " -- which is reflected in his budget , really hits home for @entity20			1
and that 's not what we 've been hearing in the news these days			0
we hear an unrepentant tirade from @entity83 pundits that regulations are nothing but " job killers			0
" but @entity2 is telling us they save lives and create jobs ? well , that not only happens to be the case , but @entity83 pundits also conveniently disregard the fact that there were fewer regulations put in place in the first three years of the @entity2 administration than in the first three years of the @entity98 presidency			2
but let 's look at the facts that underscore why @entity20 care about this issue			1
hundreds of thousands of @entity102 are already at work in clean energy jobs			1
more than 100,000 people already work in the solar industry , according to the @entity107			0
installing solar panels can not be outsourced and fits the bill for many construction workers struggling to get by , and is a tremendous opportunity for many @entity48 entrepreneurs , who already have a strong foothold in the construction industry			0
the president has also spoken of jobs that @entity20 might get on farms -- wind farms , that is - thanks to the growth of wind power , which the @entity122 says now employs 85,000 @entity102			2
more than 150,000 jobs are already out there in the clean car industry â € ” for workers making parts and assembling hybrid and electric cars			0
and the shift to more advanced vehicles means more opportunity in the coming years			0
we keep hearing about these " job killing regulations , " but for millions of @entity102 and especially minority and low income communities , clean air protections are " life - saving regulations			0
" this is another big reason environmental issues are registering on the minds of many @entity48 families , especially @entity48 mothers , a key swing vote group in the upcoming elections			1
low income communities overwhelmingly suffer the worst impacts of pollution nationally			0
cleaning up our communities means protecting our health and creating jobs ( after all , someone needs to build and install the equipment necessary to protect us from polluters )			1
clean air safeguards generated approximately $ 1.3 trillion in public health and environmental benefits in 2010 alone for a cost of $ 50 billion			1
for @entity48 families , who often lack health insurance even if they are employed full time , these savings can make the difference between home ownership and foreclosure			2
so as you listen to the politicians shouting at each other in @entity169 , they are drawing a very bright line and letting you know what really matters to them			0
ask yourself , " who has my and my family 's best interests in mind ? " the folks looking out for public health or the folks representing polluters who do n't want to invest in @entity102 , or in their employees â € ” not to mention the facilities that are now finally being forced to live up to the law ? the folks who see opportunities to bring manufacturing back to @entity102 as we shift to cleaner energy or those working to keep things just the way they are â € ” no matter the price ? the answer is pretty clear			1
and that is what we need right now			0
follow @entity199 on @entity200 join the conversation on @entity202 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			0

@entity205 says @entity2 's committment to environment *resonates* wtih @entity20
she says jobs and clean energy are linked for @entity20 , whose unemployment is high
she says pollution *important* issue to @entity48 mothers , who often live in poor communities
