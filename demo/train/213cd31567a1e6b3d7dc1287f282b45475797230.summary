they say it is the sport of kings , and a king 's ransom has been paid for a single horse at auction house @entity7			2
on tuesday , @entity9 from the @entity10 of @entity11 shelled out 4.5 million guineas ( $ 7.3m ) for @entity12 1,000 @entity13 , making her the highest - priced filly in training in @entity17 auction history			1
on what was the second day of @entity7 ' december sale , nearly $ 50m exchanged hands in a litany of purchases			0
somewhat bizarrely , @entity9 already had part ownership of the filly , but was buying out the @entity25 -- a family with a rich history in racehorse ownership and breeding -- in partnership with new co-owners the @entity32			1
it was the first time a classic - winning filly had been up for sale at @entity7 for more than two decades			0
the bidding war at the notorious auction house in @entity38 , @entity39 , had opened at 500,000 guineas , before @entity41 battled it out successfully with @entity43 and @entity44			1
however , the monstrous price tag fell just shy of the 5m guineas ( $ 8.2m ) paid last year by @entity46 -- also from @entity11 -- for an unraced , untrained and untested filly bred from @entity48			2
the purchase means just the judge will remain in @entity52 silks next season and continue her partnership with trainer @entity55			2
bloodstock agent @entity56 , who acts on behalf of @entity9 , told @entity7 : " this is a new one - off tie - up with the @entity32			1
" this has allowed us to race another year with her and keep her			0
as she was our first @entity62 winner , we were not going to give her up easily			0
" we will campaign in the best races , get the best possible opportunities , and then she will retire to @entity65 and visit the best stallions in the world			0

sheikh @entity69 buys just the judge for 4.5 million guineas
the purchase is a @entity17 auction record for a filly in training
@entity9 enters into a new co-ownership with the @entity32
