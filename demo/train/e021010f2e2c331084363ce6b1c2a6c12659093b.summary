@entity0 -- less than six months ago , eurozone watchers had been predicting the breakup of the 17 - member bloc of nations as the euro plunged to a 25 - month low against the @entity9 dollar last july			1
even as recently as november , @entity10 , the famed ceo of @entity11 , said of the eurozone 's future that " it 's hard to tell exactly how it comes out			0
" but since then , the euro has appreciated nearly 11 % as its member countries battled to contain sovereign debt crises , rising unemployment and social unrest			2
the euro now stands at a 13 - month high against the greenback			1
and flying in the face of last year 's critics , former @entity26 chief @entity23 told @entity1 's @entity27 that the euro " was never about to collapse " and that its viability as a currency is solid			1
" the euro as a currency has never been put in question , " asserted @entity23 , while at the same time admitting the euro area 's financial stability and credit worthiness had been tested			2
as for the euro , he said it " is certainly reliable and credible			0
" yet , the euro 's gains over the past seven months is a mixed blessing			0
arguments have long - existed for and against a stronger currency			2
appreciation means investors are more confident in the euro but eurozone exports become more expensive when sold overseas ; devaluation makes the bloc 's exports more competitive globally , which many eurozone officials would prefer			0
but if the world 's major economies devalued their currencies to make exports more competitive and to spur their economies to growth again , it would be chaos , says @entity23			0
" if the reasoning is the same in all constituencies you have nothing but ... a ' beggar - thy - neighbor ' policy which is a recipe for catastrophe			0
" that catastrophe could take the form of an all - out currency war			1
and this week , the world 's leading banks called on the @entity72 group of richest nations to avoid such an outcome			1
" we believe major central banks should focus on enhancing their cooperation ... to guide market expectations and thus help avoid a disorderly interest rate adjustment process and undue exchange rate volatility , " the @entity75 wrote in a letter to @entity78 finance minister @entity77 , who is chairing the @entity72 finance minister 's meeting later this week			1
but with the eurozone in recession for the second time in four years , the desire to devalue the euro may be strong			0
the @entity26 in december cut its 2013 growth forecast , with a best - case growth rate scenario of only 0.3 %			1
" it is no time for complacency , " warned @entity23 who added that the central banks of the @entity9 , @entity94 and @entity95 as well as their private sectors should get their " house ( s ) in order			0

former @entity26 chief says euro was never going to collapse
in 2012 , critics predicted at least *partial* breakup of 17 - member eurozone
@entity108 plunged to 25 - month low against @entity9 dollar in july 2012
currency war fears prevail in run - up to @entity72 finance ministers meeting this week
