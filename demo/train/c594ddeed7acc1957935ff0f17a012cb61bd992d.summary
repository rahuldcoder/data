-- is the @entity1 -- often dubbed the " best football league in the world " -- about to make its financial clout count in @entity6 's biggest club competition ? @entity7 might have dominated last season 's @entity8 , with @entity10 and @entity11 contesting the final , but @entity13 should brace itself for an @entity15 armada , according to a leading financial expert			1
according to the 23rd @entity20 finance from sports business group @entity21 , @entity1 clubs ' revenue reached a record $ 4.19 billion in the 2012 - 13 season			1
and with the @entity1 's $ 9.4 billion , three - year television deal -- $ 5.7 billion for domestic rights , the rest for overseas -- having started in 2013 - 14 , @entity15 clubs could be set for a huge financial advantage over their continental rivals			2
" the new tv deal puts those @entity1 teams qualifying for the @entity8 in a good position because they 'll be generating a lot more revenue than their @entity36 opponents , " @entity21 senior consultant @entity29 told @entity0			2
" for @entity1 clubs , the increase we 've seen this year and one we 'll definitely see next year because of the television deal , gives them a real opportunity to challenge even with the new @entity48 regulations , " added @entity38 , referring to the rules imposed by @entity6 's governing body to ensure clubs live within their means			1
since 2000 , @entity7 clubs have won the @entity8 six times , twice the number managed by @entity15 teams in that time			0
" @entity15 teams will be generating more revenue than anyone else and while the likes of @entity58 and @entity10 can negotiate their television rights , the @entity1 sides will be very competitive , " @entity29 said			0
but it 's not all good news for the 20 @entity1 clubs -- over 75 % of their revenue increase in 2012 - 13 was spent on wages			1
the report shows that total wages rose by 8 % to £ 1.8 billion ( $ 3 billion ) and resulted in the overall @entity1 clubs ' wages - to - revenue ratio reaching a record high of 71 %			1
the ratio was just 44 % for the @entity1 's first season in 1991 - 1992			0
so with revenue going into players ' pockets almost as soon as it arrives at the banks of @entity15 top - flight teams , aggregate operating profit fell by £ 2 million to £ 82 million ( $ 137 million ) -- an operating margin of just 3 % of revenue			0
however , 13 @entity1 clubs made an operating profit in 2012 - 13 compared with just 10 in the previous year			1
" the pattern in spending on wages following previous increases in broadcast deals , suggests it 's likely around 60 % or more of the revenue increase in 2013 - 14 will flow through to wages , " added @entity29			1
" on that basis , we would expect @entity1 total wage costs to reach a new record level of around £ 2.2 billion ( $ 3.68 billion )			2
" however , given the forecast increase in revenue , this would also return the wages - to - revenue ratio below 70 % for the first time since 2009 - 10			0
" while the total @entity36 football market grew to a record $ 28.65 billion in 2012 - 13 , the @entity1 led the way once again			1
according to @entity21 , a 21 % growth in commercial income enabled @entity1 club revenue to top $ 4.19 billion for the first time			2
the success of the @entity1 means its rivals have been left behind with @entity108 ( $ 2.85 billion ) , @entity7 ( $ 2.68 billion ) , @entity109 ( $ 2.34 billion ) and @entity110 ( $ 1.84 billion ) trailing in its wake			2
" once again the global appeal of the @entity1 has continued to drive commercial revenue growth , particularly at the highest ranked @entity1 clubs , " said @entity21 's @entity112			1
" matchday revenue also increased by 6 % with fewer unsold seats at @entity1 games than ever before			0
" and that lucrative television deal will only serve to swell the coffers of @entity1 clubs next season			0
" we estimate that @entity1 clubs ' revenue will have increased by almost 30 % to £ 3.2 billion ( $ 5.4 billion ) in 2013 - 14 , " @entity112 added			1
" this growth will be driven by the revenue from the first season of the @entity1 's new broadcast deals and further commercial revenue growth at the biggest clubs			0
" in total , @entity1 revenue grew by $ 276 million , some 7 % , with @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 responsible for 60 % of the growth			2
" four of the big five leagues have maintained or reduced revenue - to - wages ratio and have shown a greater sense of cost control , " said @entity29			0
" in @entity7 , the ratio is the lowest it has been since 2000 and is indicative of what we 're beginning to see in @entity6			0
" it 's different in the @entity1 because of the upcoming television deal and so clubs are spending more as they know the money is coming in			0
" in 2012 - 13 , the cumulative revenue of the " big five " @entity149 grew 5 % to $ 13.3 million , representing half of the overall size of the @entity36 football market of $ 27.1 billion ( up 2 % )			1
while the @entity1 tops the revenue table , it comes second to the @entity155 in terms of profitability			0
the 18 - team @entity108 league , won by @entity160 , made operating profits of $ 379 million compared to the @entity1 's $ 137 million			1
@entity160 and @entity162 combined represented over 80 % of the league 's $ 199 million revenue increase			2
the @entity155 is the only top - five league where broadcast deals are not the largest source of revenue , with @entity108 clubs retaining the strictest cost control with a wages - to - revenue ratio of 51 %			1
in @entity7 , commercial and matchday revenues both decreased during the 2012 - 13 season , while new television deals drove the league 's $ 105 million ( 4 % ) revenue increase			1
in @entity109 , broadcast income continues to dominate , contributing $ 1.36 billion ( 59 % ) to the total of clubs ' revenues			0
while the total league revenue was up 6 % to $ 132 millon , the 20 @entity181 teams also showed how they are cutting costs , recording operating loss reductions of $ 146 million			0
in @entity110 , @entity185 - backed @entity184 accounted for all of the league 's revenue growth for the second successive year .			0

over 75 % of the @entity1 clubs ' revenue increase in 2012 - 13 was spent on wages
total @entity36 football market grew to a record $ 28.65 billion
@entity1 clubs generated the highest revenue
@entity108 's @entity155 was @entity6 's most profitable league
