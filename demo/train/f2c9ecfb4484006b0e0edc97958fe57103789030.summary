-- everyone knows @entity2 is big			1
but the truth is that it 's huge			2
on an average day , @entity2 accounts for about 25 percent of all consumer internet traffic running through @entity7 isps			1
that 's a far larger slice of than previously thought , and it means that with so many consumer devices connecting to @entity2 each day , it 's bigger than @entity12 , @entity13 , and @entity14 combined			1
it also explains why @entity2 is building data centers as fast as it possibly can			2
three years ago , the company 's services accounted for about 6 percent of the internet 's traffic			1
" what 's really interesting is , over just the past year , how pervasive @entity2 has become , not just in @entity2 data centers , but throughout the @entity7 internet , " says @entity21 , founder of @entity22 , the internet monitoring company that crunched the data			1
his probes show that more than 62 percent of the smartphones , laptops , video streamers , and other devices that tap into the internet from throughout @entity7 connect to @entity2 at least once a day			1
@entity21 calls @entity2 's traffic " astounding			1
" the lion 's share of it comes from @entity36			0
but @entity2 traffic involving search , analytics , web apps , and advertising is far from insignificant			1
take these numbers with a grain of salt , though			0
it 's impossible to get a total picture of the internet , so @entity48 's numbers are a best guess based on the traffic flowing through its internet service provider partners			2
still , there 's no question that @entity2 is big and getting massive			1
to handle its growth , @entity2 has been on a building binge			2
it now has data centers on four continents			0
all this work has been getting a lot of attention			0
but the tech titan is also hip - deep in another type of build - out , one that 's largely gone under the radar			0
@entity2 has added thousands of servers — called @entity68 servers — to @entity69 around the world			2
these servers store the most popular content from @entity2 's network — a @entity36 video that 's going viral right now or apps from the @entity77 marketplace , for example — then serve it directly from the @entity69 's data center , rather than streaming it all the way from @entity2 's data center			2
these servers were in a handful of @entity7 @entity69 three years ago			1
today , they 're in 80 percent of them , @entity83 says			0
companies like @entity87 and @entity88 have been doing this type of caching for years			0
it helps speed up popular pages on websites like @entity94			0
but lately some big websites have started cutting content delivery deals directly with @entity69			0
it 's a strategy that @entity13 very publicly embraced just over a year ago , but one that @entity2 is much more reluctant to discuss			1
the company declined to comment for this story , and @entity69 that use the @entity68 servers are n't allowed to talk about them			0
that 's not a huge surprise			0
@entity2 does some pretty amazing things behind the scenes , and while it 's considered to be the world 's leader in infrastructure magic , it generally considers this work to be a closely held proprietary secret			2
still , @entity13 and @entity2 's move into so many of the @entity69 network operations centers that are just a few miles from its customers — what networking geeks call the " edge " of the network — is likely to be followed by other internet giants such as @entity121 and @entity12 , @entity111 believes			1
" it used to be that the focus of people like @entity2 and @entity12 was about building data centers , " he says			1
" they 're still doing that , but what is equally interesting is watching these edge boxes — these servers being embedded just everywhere			0
