@entity0 , @entity1 -- they look like cumulus clouds rolling through the park -- puffy and white			1
but they are more sinister than that			1
the clouds are from a huge wildfire in northern @entity1 , which is threatening @entity0			2
the @entity10 says the @entity11 has consumed tens of thousands of acres in the park , but it has so far had little or no direct impact on @entity15 , a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the famous cliffs and waterfalls in the park			1
firefighters hope to keep it that way			2
@entity0 fire : blaze spreads to national park " this is going to be a tough fire			2
it 's going to continue for a few more weeks , " said @entity31 , chief of the @entity32			1
crews are doing their best , but just a spark or two could send the inferno raging			2
these are scary times for the folks of @entity39 , a picturesque community threatened by the blaze			2
" it is dangerous for them right now , " @entity43 chief @entity42 said			1
" when you 're on a ridge like this and the fire is below you , that is a recipe for disaster			2
" @entity39 is on the northern edge of the @entity11 , a monster of a wildfire that has charred more than 192,000 acres			1
it 's the seventh - largest blaze in @entity1 history , requiring the efforts of more than 4,500 personnel			2
the blaze was 30 % contained as of evening wednesday			1

in @entity65 , @entity64 was poised to evacuate			2
" to be this close is to be scared , " said @entity64 , a wildlife rehabilitator who lives in the threatened town with her husband			2

firefighters are at @entity91 protecting critical facilities , the @entity89 said wednesday			0
water quality remains unchanged , despite ash that has fallen on the 459 - square - mile reservoir , because the water is drawn from a depth of 260 feet , the commission said			0
the city was already transferring 275 million gallons of water daily from @entity91 to other reservoirs because @entity91 is full , but as a precaution , the city increased that amount by 27 million gallons , a tuesday statement said			1
the commission said it was confident the @entity11 would not affect the reservoir : " due to the rocky , granite terrain and limited brush along the perimeter of the reservoir , there is little risk for direct water quality impacts			1
" the fire could threaten the area 's hydroelectric generators , which provide much of @entity76 's electricity			0
because of the approaching flames , officials shut down the generators , and the city -- more than 120 miles to the west -- temporarily is getting power from elsewhere			0
" all of @entity76 's municipal electric customers continue to be fully supplied ; there will be no interruption in electric service , " the commission said			1

evacuations also remained in place for areas south of @entity143 ( including @entity144 ) , north of @entity145 and along the highway 108 corridor between @entity147 and @entity148			0
authorities say the @entity11 started on august 17			1

" access and difficult terrain remain concerns for crews and equipment , " said an incident report			0
" rapid fire growth and extreme fire behavior are hampering suppression efforts			0
" as many as 20 helicopters and air tankers were aiding the efforts			0
a top priority is stopping the fire from spreading farther in @entity0			0
the @entity183 and @entity39 giant sequoia groves , while not in imminent danger , were closed as firefighters conduct preventative measures to protect the majestic trees			0
