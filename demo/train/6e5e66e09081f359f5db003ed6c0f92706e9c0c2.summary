@entity0 -- @entity2 might not seem like the sort of thing to make your blood boil			1
the venerable toy is one of the most popular playthings of all time			2
people of all ages love it			0
and if previous years are anything to go by , @entity15 stockings will soon be bulging with the stuff			1
but the irony is that because people feel such visceral affection for the toy , they tend to fly into a rage when they believe its standards are slipping			2
in fact , i 'm getting a bit hot under the collar myself			0
the latest furore concerns @entity2 's " franchise " sets , which depict scenes from movies like " @entity34 , " " @entity36 , " and " @entity37			1
" principled @entity2 enthusiasts have been arguing that they undermine the whole point of the toy , as they encourage children to construct showpiece models from instruction booklets rather than building something from their own imaginations			1
" @entity2 taught me the art of creative destruction -- the need to break something in order to make something better , " wrote the blogger @entity46			1
" @entity2 for me was always about creativity , remaking and improving on existing designs			1
those things do n't happen with the sets that are designed to build a model of a single thing			2
" good old generic @entity2 , with endless possibilities on offer , has n't gone away , it 's just been drowned in a sea of marketing for other brands			1
" @entity2 spokesman @entity63 contested these claims			1
" the bricks will probably still end up in big boxes in homes and that will act as a pool for creativity , " he said			0
but many believe that the complex pieces contained in franchise sets make it very difficult for children to pursue their own designs ( @entity2 now manufactures no less than 3,000 individual pieces )			1
this is not the only time that @entity2 has found itself embroiled in controversy			1
in 2011 , when it released " @entity81 , " a range aimed at girls that included beauty parlors , cupcake bakeries and great quantities of the color pink , it was accused of crude gender stereotyping			0
as one seven - year - old girl wrote in a viral letter , " all the girls did was sit at home , go to the beach , and shop , and they had no jobs , but the boys went on adventures , worked , saved people , and had jobs , even swam with sharks			0
" ( @entity2 's ham - fisted attempt to address these concerns , a new set called " @entity105 " that featured female scientists , sold out within days			1
) for any discerning adult , all this makes you want to weep			0
whatever happened to the idea of buying big bags of @entity2 for your children and letting their imaginations do the rest ? it all seems a long way from the guiding principle of @entity2 's founder , the @entity121 toymaker @entity122 , that " @entity123 bedster er ikke for godt " -- " only the best is worthy			1
" and it supports the general impression that the classic toys of previous decades are being replaced by overly commercialized , sexualized , dumbed - down bits of tat			2
let 's skip @entity131 and @entity132 and take , for instance , @entity134			2
its new @entity136 range , which is aimed squarely at girls , includes scenes like " @entity139 , " " @entity140 , " and " @entity141 , " all awash with sickly pink			2
( because that 's what girls are supposed to be into , right ? ) boys , however , are presented with the " @entity156 " range , which includes a video camera that can be attached to a remote - control car so that kids can spy remotely on people ( let 's not mention the ethical tension between privacy and surveillance )			2
this bears scant resemblance to the traditional @entity134 -- those innocent little figures with the inverted crescent smile , those skinny horses to clip them on -- which fired the imaginations of generations of children over the last few decades			2
now , we all understand that toy manufacturers are not charities			0
they are in it for the money , and good for them			0
but play is a vitally important part of a child 's development , and toy manufactures are uniquely placed to influence their lives -- for the better or for the worse			1
why do we stand back while they ride roughshod over our kids ' moral and spiritual well - being in the pursuit of maximum profit ? obviously , creating multiple differentials and marketing towards them is good for business			0
the more the consumer -- that is , the child -- can be sold the idea that this particular product is essential for a lifestyle aspiration , the more the dollars will come rolling in			0
it makes for a depressing indictment of society 's view of childhood			1
as @entity15 approaches , millions of harassed adults will stream into toy stores all over the world in search of that special something that will make their little one 's eyes light up			1
in the vast majority of those stores , the toys will be divided by gender			0
boys ' toys will be largely action - based , while girls ' toys will be centered around dolls , homemaking and the attempt to conform to a specific idea of beauty , all decked out in pink and tied with a bow			0
the gifts will be selected , wrapped and presented			0
there will follow two days of mayhem			0
the girls will instantly be wearing tacky princess dresses ; the boys will be armed to the teeth and roaring			0
toys that appear impressive but are actually impossible to play with will be littered in the corners of rooms			1
electronic noises will blare unneeded from every corner , and children will enter a vegetative state as they sit for hour upon hour in the dystopian glow of various screens			0
now , i 'm not a @entity239			0
but it strikes me that @entity15 should be more than just an orgy of consumerism			1
this yuletide , therefore , perhaps we should consider these questions seriously			0
what sort of adults will today 's children become ? what sort of world will they create ? and what are their toys actually doing to them ?			2

@entity15 stockings will be bulging with @entity2 , especially sets depicting movie scenes
@entity2 enthusiasts argue they undermine point of toy , to stimulate imaginations
play is vitally important part of a child 's development , says @entity268
aspirational toys make for depressing indictment of society 's view of childhood , he argues
