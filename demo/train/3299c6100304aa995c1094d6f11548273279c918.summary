-- in the escalating conflict between the @entity3 and @entity4 over @entity5 , the stakes are high for each side			2
on thursday , the @entity3 plans to vote on whether attorney general @entity7 should be held in contempt of @entity4 for refusing to turn over @entity10 documents related to the controversial gun - walking program			1
congressional lawmakers leading the charge see themselves as fulfilling a core prerogative of the legislative branch : to conduct investigations of possible wrongdoing or incompetence within the executive branch			1
the @entity3 , they would argue , can not properly fulfill this duty without access to key documents			0
the @entity24 administration also sees itself as carrying out important institutional functions of the executive branch : to protect the privacy of internal deliberations and enable the @entity10 to conduct its own inquiry without outside meddling			2
to some political observers , this skirmish is just another political ploy by a @entity35 - led committee that wants to embarrass the president in an election year			0
others disagree and see the president as acting in bad faith by asserting executive privilege to withhold the documents			1
@entity42 : the truth about the @entity5 scandal inevitably , executive privilege disputes result in accusations of political gamesmanship			1
it 's impossible to know the true motivations of those involved , but we can evaluate the constitutional merits of the president 's action			0
executive privilege has a long history in our system of separated powers			1
the phrase never actually was used until the @entity61 era , but presidents going back to @entity63 have at times exercised some form of what we now call executive privilege			1
it is recognized as the right of the president and certain high - level executive branch officials to withhold information ( documents and testimony ) from those who have compulsory power -- congressional committees or judicial entities such as special prosecutors			0
some of the most contentious disputes in @entity82 history -- @entity83 , the @entity84 -- have centered on executive privilege claims			1
presidents marshal support for executive privilege claims by arguing that the requested documents or testimony encompass one or more of the following : presidential communications , internal deliberations , national security matters and information pertaining to an ongoing law enforcement investigation			2
@entity24 's claim on the @entity5 documents relies on the internal deliberative process rationale and the ongoing law enforcement investigation defense			0
ultimately , the president 's claim fails because it is too broad and does not overcome the strong presumption in favor of congressional access to information when there are allegations of misconduct in the executive branch			0
furthermore , the longstanding standard for any executive privilege claim is that the president must be protecting information that , if released publicly , would cause some substantial harm to our national interest			2
the president can not assert this power merely to avoid the release of potentially embarrassing or politically inconvenient details			0
what happens if @entity7 is cited ? @entity5 is a department - level program seemingly far removed from presidential oversight and direction			0
the very act of @entity24 using executive privilege in this case creates so many questions that @entity4 would be negligent in its duties to not press the president to properly explain his position or disclose the subpoenaed documents			1
as for the accusation that @entity3 @entity35 could be playing politics , that is certainly plausible			0
but concerns about a @entity10 program that appears to be designed to allow government - owned guns to be given to @entity138 gangs , without a plan for how these weapons would be tracked , overcome any argument about the political motivations			0
any discussion about the program being " botched " is mere speculation until @entity4 receives all the relevant documents about how it was formulated and implemented			0
finally , even if the @entity24 administration 's account of @entity5 is accurate , what is the point of stonewalling @entity4 ? @entity7 has already given the @entity3 some documents , which entail the deliberative process , so the primary justification for making the executive privilege claim seems makeweight			1
only full disclosure will help to reveal the truth of what happened with @entity5 , and from there , perhaps @entity4 will be able hold government officials accountable			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 and @entity162 .			2

the @entity3 plans to vote on whether to hold attorney general @entity7 in contempt
@entity166 , @entity167 : congressional lawmakers are seeking truth
@entity24 can not assert executive privilege just to hide embarrassing details , they say
@entity161 , @entity162 : disclosure will reveal what happened with the botched operation
