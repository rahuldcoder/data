-- the girl on fire is still burning bright ! @entity4 's hotly anticipated sequel " @entity5 : catching @entity8 " trounced the competition over its first weekend at the box office , pulling in an estimated $ 161.1 million			1
that gross handily beats the $ 152.5 million opening of " @entity5 , " which opened in march 2012 , and it stands as the best november debut of all time ahead of " @entity12 : @entity13 , " which bowed with $ 142.9 million in 2009			1
only three films have ever opened higher than " @entity15 " : " @entity16 " ( $ 207.4 million ) , " @entity17 " ( $ 174.1 million ) , and " @entity18 and the @entity19 " ( $ 169.2 million )			1
' @entity5 : catching @entity8 ' : test your smarts ! many prognosticators ( this one included ) thought " @entity15 " might surpass " @entity24 3 's " opening earlier this year , but the superhero sequel had the notable advantage of @entity29 ticket sales , and " @entity15 " fell short			1
still , if estimates hold up when final grosses are released tomorrow , " @entity15 " will have bested " @entity35 " as the highest 2 - @entity33 opener of all time			2
( " rises " pulled in $ 160.9 million during its opening weekend in 2012			2
) even without @entity29 appeal , " @entity15 " played very well on @entity40 screens			0
the large - screen format accounted for $ 12.6 million of its domestic debut			2
" @entity15 " played to audiences in all four quadrants			0
crowds over 25 and under 25 were evenly split , and although the film had more female viewers than males ( 59 percent vs. 41 percent ) , more men turned out on opening weekend than for the original " @entity5			2
" females made up 61 percent of that film 's opening weekend audience			0
the passionate moviegoers who saw the film this weekend awarded the film an enthusiastic " a " @entity56 grade , which will yield great word - of - mouth as the film enters the lucrative @entity58 period next weekend			0
it seems likely that holiday business will help " @entity15 " surpass " @entity5 ' " $ 408 million domestic total , but we 'll have to wait and see whether that actually happens			1
review : ' @entity5 : catching @entity8 ' internationally , " @entity15 " is already doing double the numbers of " @entity5 , " which pulled in $ 283.2 million overseas for a $ 691.2 million worldwide total			1
" @entity15 " grossed $ 146.6 million overseas in its first weekend from 63 territories , giving it a dazzling $ 307.7 million worldwide opening weekend			1
that 's up 45 percent from " @entity5 ' " $ 211.8 million global debut — a whopping $ 152.5 million of which came from the @entity71 and @entity72			1
" @entity15 , " which stars current it girl ( and @entity77 winner for last year 's " @entity78 " ) @entity79 , boasts a relatively slim budget compared to most mega-blockbusters			2
@entity4 spent $ 130 million on the film — a major increase from the original " @entity5 ' " $ 78 million budget			1
for context , here are the budgets for untested franchise launchpads that tried to get off the ground earlier this year : " @entity88 " ( $ 215 million ) , " @entity89 " ( $ 195 million ) , " @entity90 " ( $ 190 million ) , " @entity91 " ( $ 150 million ) , " @entity92 " ( $ 135 million )			0
none of those films earned , in their entire domestic runs , what " @entity15 " earned in its first two days			1
" @entity99 : @entity106 " spent its third weekend in second place , but fell 61 percent to $ 14.1 million , giving the $ 170 million @entity103 film a $ 167.8 million total after three weekends			2
" @entity106 " will probably surpass " @entity107 " $ 181 million domestic total next weekend , but it now appears unlikely to endure much past the $ 200 million mark , which is somewhat disappointing given the @entity112 character 's " @entity16 " exposure			1
fortunately , the superhero film is thriving overseas , where it 's earned $ 381 million after four weekends			1
worldwide , the film has now earned $ 548.8 million			2
10 swoon - inducing @entity118 couples in third place , @entity120 's comedic sequel " @entity121 " fell by a hefty 58 percent in its second weekend to $ 12.5 million			1
though the film , which stars @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 , dropped harder than expected — especially given its exemplary " a + " cinemascore grade — in its second weekend , " @entity131 " has already earned $ 50.4 million total , a great number considering it cost @entity130 just $ 17 million to produce			1
the studio has already ordered another " @entity134 " entry			0
@entity135 attempted to counter-program against " @entity15 " with the @entity137 comedy " @entity138 " this weekend , but the plan did n't work out			2
" @entity138 " delivered just $ 8.2 million worth of ticket sales			0
@entity137 , who enjoyed a hot streak from 2005 - 2009 with films like " @entity143 , " " @entity144 " and " @entity145 , " has struggled at the box office as of late			1
" @entity138 " will join " @entity149 " ( $ 48.5 million total ) , " @entity151 " ( $ 35.4 million ) and " @entity152 " ( $ 44.7 million ) as under - performers on his filmography			0
audiences , which were evenly split between men and women , gave the film a " b + " cinemascore grade			0
' snl ' recap : the odds are n't really in @entity162 's favor fifth place belonged to " free birds , " which dipped 35 percent to $ 5.3 million in its fourth weekend			1
after an under - cooked opening weekend , @entity58 - themed animation has held up well as the holiday approaches , though it has still earned only $ 48.6 million against a $ 55 million budget			2
" @entity5 : catching @entity8 " -- $ 161.1 million 2			1
" @entity99 : @entity106 " -- $ 14.1 million 3			0
" @entity121 " -- $ 12.5 million 4			0
" delivery man " -- $ 8.2 million 5			0
" @entity169 " -- $ 5.3 million two new openers made a splash in limited release			0
@entity135 's animated princess movie " @entity174 " scored a cool $ 238,000 from one theater in @entity176 , while the @entity178 oscar - contender " @entity179 " drew $ 133,700 from four locations			0
on wednesday , " @entity174 " will move into about 3,600 locations ( and provide the only real competition for " @entity15 " over the @entity58 frame ) , while " @entity179 " will expand to about 500 venues			0
check back next weekend to see how both films — and newcomers " @entity188 " and " homefront " — fare			0
