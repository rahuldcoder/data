-- it was a sight @entity3 's hordes of @entity5 fans had longed to see -- the world no. 4 celebrating on @entity8 's @entity7 after defeating @entity9 in a final			1
@entity3 's emphatic straight - sets triumph over the world no. 1 in the men 's singles gold medal match at @entity15 showed that , despite tasting defeat in four major finals , the @entity16 could finally be ready to win his first grand slam title at the @entity20			1
that is the view of former major winners @entity23 and @entity24 , who have tipped the third seed to break his major hoodoo in @entity27 -- where @entity3 was beaten by @entity9 in the 2008 final			1
@entity29 ready for @entity20 farewell " my prediction for the @entity20 is @entity3 winning , " seven - time grand slam champion @entity23 told the @entity33 website ahead of next week 's opening matches in the two - week tournament at @entity36			1
" i 'm not saying that just because he won the @entity40 , it 's because i think that he 's a different man			2
" i think that @entity41 has helped him tremendously			0
he 's becoming better physically all the time , he hits his forehand better , but the biggest difference is emotionally			2
" he 's more even - keeled , he 's more positive , and there 's not as much pressure for him at the @entity20 as there is at @entity8			1
" @entity3 , who will play @entity49 @entity48 in the @entity20 first round , won the @entity36 event as a junior in 2004 but has so far been frustrated in three grand slam title matches by 17 - time grand slam winner @entity9 -- including in last month 's @entity8 final			1
he lost to former world no. 1 @entity56 in last year 's @entity58 final , but defeated the @entity59 in the @entity40 semis this month			1
@entity23 , who won the @entity20 in 1988 as he topped the world rankings , believes the 25 - year - old @entity3 can produce his top form on his favorite hard - court surface			1
" the hard courts in @entity27 are a little quicker than in @entity66 , which suit him , " said the @entity64			0
" i do think @entity3 is one - up against @entity9 and @entity56 after the @entity40 -- he knows that he can beat them back - to - back now			1
" i think five - set matches , with the attitude he has now , are going to favor him and when he plays well with a good attitude he is at least as good a player as the other top three			0
" @entity3 is bidding to become the first @entity5 male to win a grand slam title since @entity77 in 1936 , and he is more confident than ever he can deliver a long - awaited success			1
" i think in the short term ( my confidence has grown ) , certainly , " @entity3 , who became the first @entity5 man to reach the @entity8 final since 1938 , told the @entity20 's official website			1
" but things change in tennis and in sport really , really quick			0
in the immediate aftermath of big wins or good tournaments , normally you 'll feel quite confident and comfortable going for your shots in the important moments and even at the beginning of matches			0
" @entity3 also hailed the impact of coach @entity41 , who knows what it takes to win grand slams having claimed eight during an 18 - year playing career in which he topped the world rankings			1
" tactically , for sure , he 's very good , " @entity3 said of the @entity102 - born @entity49			2
" very minor technical things			0
but also just his experience , knowing how to schedule your tournaments			0
a year like this year is incredibly busy , very different to what we 're used to with the @entity40			2
" having someone like him around who understands that , can also pass on his experiences to not just me but the rest of my team , as well , he 's been a huge benefit			0
" also , after i lost @entity8 , having someone like him who 's been through that before to talk to , the best ways to deal with it and move on from it , all that stuff 's helped			0
that 's why i wanted to work with him			0
not just me , but my whole team 's enjoyed having him around			0
i hope he 's enjoyed it , too			0
" one man who knows all about waiting for a first grand slam title is @entity24			1
the @entity131 did not play in a major final until his remarkable run to the @entity8 title as a wildcard in 2001 -- 13 years after turning professional			0
the former world no. 2 does n't see the absence of injured 11 - time grand slam champion @entity138 as having any bearing on @entity3 's chances			1
" i think @entity3 is ready , with or without him , " said @entity24			2
" he has beaten @entity138 before anyway			0
if @entity3 plays well , he can win it			2
" i would really like to see him win it -- he deserves it			0
he played a really great @entity40 and i think this will give him extra motivation and confidence			2
the @entity20 is his best surface so i think he will do it			2
" the draw made thursday also threw up a likely semifinal clash between @entity3 and @entity9			1
the @entity152 begins his campaign against home opposition in the shape of @entity156			0
defending champion and second seed @entity56 starts against @entity160 's @entity159			0
the women 's 2011 winner @entity161 was drawn against @entity131 's @entity163 , with top seed @entity164 playing world no. 74 @entity165			1
@entity8 and @entity40 champion @entity169 , in the same half of the draw as @entity164 , is in an all - american duel with @entity172			2
@entity169 's elder sister @entity173 is also paired with an @entity49			0
the seven - time major winner plays @entity175 on her return to the tournament where she was diagnosed with @entity178 12 months ago			1
three - time champion @entity29 , appearing in her final grand slam before retiring from the sport , faces @entity40 mixed doubles silver medalist @entity181 of @entity183 .			1
