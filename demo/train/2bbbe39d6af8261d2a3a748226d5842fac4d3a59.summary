-- efforts to curb overfishing in five of the world 's marine ecosystems are starting to show signs of working			1
many fisheries around the world are dangerously close to collapsing			0
the news comes from a multi-national study on the status of marine fisheries and ecosystems reported in " science "			0
while the report found that stock collapse is an increasing international trend , the scientists involved believe there are positive signs that rebuilding the ocean 's depleted fish stocks is possible			1
the two year study looked at ten marine ecosystems , evaluating how much marine life was being fished and which management techniques have been used to rebuild depleted stocks			0
it is a follow - up to a 2006 paper that highlighted a widespread global trend toward fisheries collapse that led to disagreement among the scientific community			2
the study found signs of some stock recovery in waters around the @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , supporting the argument that well managed fishing can lead to rebuilding fisheries in other parts of the world			1
" these highly managed ecosystems are improving " said @entity45 of the @entity46 and one of the report 's lead authors			1
" yet there is still a long way to go : of all fish stocks that we examined sixty - three percent remained below target and still needed to be rebuilt			0
" " across all regions we are still seeing a troubling trend of increasing stock collapse , " said @entity56 , of @entity57 and co-author of the report			1
" but this paper shows that our oceans are not a lost cause			0
the encouraging result is that exploitation rate -- the ultimate driver of depletion and collapse -- is decreasing in half of the ten systems we examined in detail			0
this means that management in those areas is setting the stage for ecological and economic recovery			2
it 's only a start , but it gives me hope that we have the ability to bring overfishing under control			2
" most of the marine ecosystems studied were in intensive managed areas in developed countries where the scientists were able to collect regular data			1
however , the report also found that often overfishing would move to areas with weaker laws and enforcement			1
while most of the fisheries that showed improvement are managed by a few wealthy nations , there are some exceptions			0
in @entity104 , scientists , managers , and local communities teamed up to close some key areas to fishing and restrict certain types of fishing gear			1
according to the study , this led to an increase in the size and amount of fish available -- and an increase in fishers ' incomes			0
" these successes are local - but they are inspiring others to follow suit , " says @entity118 of the @entity119 in @entity104			2
" we know that more fish can be harvested with less fishing effort and less impact on the environment , if we first slow down and allow over-fished populations to rebuild , " said @entity123 from the @entity124 , another author of the report			2
" scientists and managers in places as different as @entity38 and @entity104 have been able to reduce overfishing and rebuild fish populations despite serious challenges			1
" while the study suggests that closing areas to fishing , banning some types of fishing gear and changing fishing quotas have long - term benefits , they also come with short - term costs to fishers			1
" some places have chosen to end overfishing , " said @entity148 from the @entity46 in the report			2
" that choice can be painful for fishermen in the short term , but in the long term it benefits fish , fishermen , and our ocean ecosystems as a whole			0
" however , " lessons from one spot need to be applied very carefully to a new area , " said co-author @entity161 of the @entity162 from @entity163 in @entity164 , since " there are no single silver bullet solutions			0
management efforts must be customized to the place and the people			0

*methods* available to meet fishing needs and *conservation* , report suggests
*general* trend is towards overfishing , but rates in some areas slowing
@entity39 , @entity37 , and @entity38 show signs of some stock recovery
@entity104 provides rare success story of managed fishing in less developed countries
