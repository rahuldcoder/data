even though @entity2 had n't been beaten in the division until sunday , a run of five draws in seven games allowed in - form @entity11 to grab the lead and now @entity11 -- with an eight - point cushion -- is in pole position to make it three league titles in a row			1
for all its possession , @entity2 was always playing catch up , since @entity11 struck early through free - scoring midfielder @entity23 -- he beat @entity24 from close range following @entity27 's good work in the 17th minute			1
@entity11 all but put the game away in the 48th minute when defender @entity29 connected with @entity31 's teasing free kick at the back post			2
@entity2 was out of sorts and @entity34 received a straight red in the 75th minute for his two - footed tackle on @entity38 international teammate @entity37			1
@entity31 , back from a knee injury , took the ensuing free kick and seconds later @entity41 saw red for his hand ball on the line			0
@entity44 sent @entity24 the wrong way from the penalty spot to end @entity2 's miserable evening			1
elsewhere in @entity38 , @entity47 beat @entity48 1 - 0 but @entity49 -- the league 's leading scorer -- limped off with a knee injury after a challenge from defender @entity53			1
it was the same knee that has troubled the @entity38 international in recent years and forced him to miss @entity56			2

@entity60 plays monday but manager @entity61 confirmed sunday that he would be leaving when his contract expires at the end of the season			0
