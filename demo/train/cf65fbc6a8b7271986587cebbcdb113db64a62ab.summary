in @entity2 , fishermen call them " thumb splitters " because of the painful blow they can inflict			0
in @entity6 , they 're so dangerous , that seafood restaurants store them live inside empty plastic water bottles so they can be handled			0
the mantis shrimp -- a sea crustacean that resembles a praying mantis -- has a set of claws that accelerate so fast when it strikes that they create air bubbles which , when they explosively collapse , also serve to stun the mantis 's prey			2
supersonic potential the effect is known in physics as supercavitation and marine engineers are taking their cue from the humble mantis shrimp to create objects that , theoretically , at least , could one day travel underwater at supersonic speeds			1
the principle works on the fact that when an object traveling through the water is encased in bubbles , there is little to no friction or drag			2
already the @entity39 have used supercavitation in the design of their torpedoes ; the @entity44 torpedo flies through the water encased in a bubble , achieving speeds in excess of 200 knots ( 230 mph )			1
for @entity55 of @entity56 , a company that has built a fully functioning supercavitating vessel , the same principles that allow seals and penguins to shoot through the water encased in a blanket of bubbles could be used in military and civilian applications			1
eliminating friction " water offers 900 times more friction than air does , " @entity55 said			2
in the same way that pushing your hand through swimming pool water creates bubbles by creating a high pressure area in front of it and low pressure area behind , supercavitating devices such as the @entity44 torpedo work by pushing a dinner plate - sized disk at its nose through the water at high speed			1
this plate is then gimbaled -- that is , it pivots on an axis -- giving the device some directional control			0
however , @entity55 said steering in this way is still an inexact science			0
" the control of pushing something through the water with a blunt face is so difficult that it 's impossible to keep that object on target , " he said			0
some part of the device , he explained , needs to be in contact with dense water to give it stability and the ability to steer			2
regaining control his supercavitating vessel " ghost " works by putting propellers at the front rather than the rear of the boat , effectively dragging it through the water			1
the 38 - foot main hull travels above the water much like a hydrofoil , but the business end of the boat is contained in the 62 - foot long tubes attached to the end of the struts			1
equipped with gas turbine engines , the boat uses a @entity119 system to funnel the expelled thrust of the propellers into the tubes to create an air bubble around the engines			1
" we 're actually flying through this incredibly dense foam , which is mostly air , which gives us much higher speeds , " he said			1
" it 's sometimes known as microbubble supercavitation			0
" decades of research the concept is not new and scientists have been working on various designs for decades			0
" @entity139 technology goes way back with some significant research carried out in the 1950s , " said @entity134 , professor @entity135 at the @entity137			1
" when a hydrofoil exceeds a certain speed , cavitation ca n't be avoided and must be accommodated by a change in hydrofoil shape to allow operation in the supercavitation mode			0
" the preliminary design of an 80 - knot ship at @entity151 in 1963/64 , utilized supercavitating hydrofoils as well as waterjet propulsion , " said @entity134 , who worked on the design team			1
@entity55 , meanwhile , has spent $ 15 million building the military - style vessel ( which he has described as a kind of " attack helicopter of the sea " ) with the aim of securing @entity160 contracts			1
civilian applications civilian interest is also growing in supercavitating vessels , not least because the boats -- which are effectively a type of submarine that bores a foam tunnel through the water -- give such a smooth ride			2
" we just came back from a surface navy show and we had serious inquiries from people who build ferries about building a high - speed ferry between @entity176 and @entity177 now that @entity177 is going to be open to the @entity178 again , " @entity55 said			1
" if you cross the @entity180 between @entity176 and @entity177 , you are in 15 - foot seas ... not only does ghost supercavitate , but the way the boat 's designed completely isolates all the wave motion from affecting the inside of the cockpit of the boat			1
" you can be in 10 - foot seas and not even feel it			2
" while @entity190 can achieve speeds in excess of 50 knots ( 57mph ) , @entity55 said its stability is likely to be its biggest selling point			1
" we 're actually marketing it as a stabilized weapons platform for that one reason -- it 's the only small vessel you can shoot precision weapons from , " he said			0
shipping cargo and warriors inquiries have also been coming in from commercial shipping companies -- an industry that loses thousands of shipping containers a year to bad weather -- about adapting the technology to create highly stable cargo ships			0
offshore oil platforms , too , have been interested in a technology that can deliver oil crews quickly , safely and without seasickness			0
despite this , @entity55 says the first interest for @entity217 is to create a military vessel that is fast enough to protect a fleet from swarm attacks and stable enough to deliver troops safely in rough seas			0
" if you want to deliver those 16 @entity225 or @entity226 to that beach in rough water and you want them to get out of that boat almost boot - dry , we have that platform			2
" we can get the warrior to where he needs to go , fit to fight and not beaten up from the @entity234 impact that some of these guys are getting in high - speed boats			0
" high - speed boats are really beating the heck out of these guys			0

@entity139 is the ability to travel underwater encased in a bubble of air
a @entity178 boat builder has designed a supercavitating vessel it aims to sell to the navy
the vessel travels on bubble - producing tubes and can reach speeds of 50 knots
