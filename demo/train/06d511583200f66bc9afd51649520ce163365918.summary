-- @entity1 and @entity2 are in pole position to pocket the @entity6 's @entity5 $ 10 million jackpot after finishing the third round tied for the lead at the season finale @entity10			1
the 27 - year - old @entity12 and the world no. 1 are two of five players in the 29 - strong field who can claim the $ 10 million prize for topping the @entity5 playoff series by winning the season 's final event at @entity21 's @entity20			1
@entity1 began the day two shots behind @entity2 but a three - under par 67 , compared to the @entity12 's 69 , ensured the @entity23 drew level at nine - under par after 54 holes			1
after friday 's heroics , where @entity1 fired a tee shot into a spectator 's trouser pocket on his way to a five - under 65 , saturday was shaping up to be equally eventful			0
a birdie , bogey , birdie start hinted at another day of high drama and low scoring before things settled down with a run of five pars			0
that sequence was broken with a birdie at the ninth followed by a bogey at 10 before an eagle three at the par five 15th saw @entity1 finally reel in his playing partner			0
" i have n't really played the par fives well all week ... it was a big turning point as it tied me for the lead , " @entity1 told @entity46			0
an errant tee shot at the par three 18th threatened to take the gloss off another polished display , but the ever - assured @entity1 made a tricky up - and - down from thick , greenside rough look simple			0
" i 've felt a little weary and in no way have i played my best golf , but i 'm tied for the lead and i ca n't ask for any more , " @entity1 said			0
earlier , three front - nine birdies had seen @entity2 extend his overnight lead to three shots but two bogeys at 10 and 13 , coupled with @entity1 's eagle , saw his advantage disappear			1
@entity62 is by no means out of contention to win the tournament after a 67 left him two shots adrift of the joint - leaders while @entity68 , @entity70 's @entity69 and @entity72 's @entity71 are all one shot further back on six under			1
of the remaining three players who can claim the @entity77 jackpot with a win on sunday no matter where other players finish , @entity73 , joint - leader with @entity2 after round one , is in closest contention			2
the @entity21 native is five under after three rounds while @entity84 is three - under par. @entity85 , however , will not be banking a $ 10m check come monday morning -- the 32 - year - old is seven - over par for his three rounds			2
