editor 's note : @entity3 @entity2 was director of the @entity4 from 2001 to 2003 and author of " @entity6 : why @entity8 and @entity3 @entity7			1
" she is ceo of the @entity10 , which specializes in market research about women and @entity8			1
@entity2 says @entity3 should treat hispanics as part of the mainstream of @entity16			1
@entity17 ( @entity18 ) -- as the members of the @entity22 prepare to choose a party chairman to serve for the next two years , the calls for new " hispanic outreach " initiatives are flying -- in my view , unnecessarily			0
it is probably true that president @entity28 's election marks the beginning of a post-partisan , post-racial @entity16 , or at least a time when these issues are less divisive than in years past			1
but will the two political parties be as able to look beyond the stereotypes of @entity34 and what the @entity8 experience is in this country , as they have for other ethnic and racial groups ? as @entity3 , we need to win at least 35 percent of the @entity8 vote to win the presidency			1
in 2008 , @entity42 got 31 percent , slightly exceeding the average for the past eight presidential elections			0
we 've had our high points ( @entity46 2004 , 44 percent ) and low points ( @entity48 1996 , 21 percent )			0
ten years ago , as an @entity22 press aide , i was given the responsibility for developing a team that would design a multimillion - dollar ad strategy to appeal to the nation 's emerging @entity8 electorate			2
we conducted seminal research on @entity8 voting patterns that is still of value today			2
for example , we identified a " @entity67 " of another 25 percent of @entity8 who were voting @entity60 on the generic presidential ballot question but would be interested in voting for a @entity3 who offered a campaign agenda focused on family , education and job - creation issues			1
so it is mystifying to me to hear the ongoing references to the party 's need to find " a new way " to speak to the nation 's largest minority bloc			0
it 's like being asked to reinvent the wheel			0
this is n't just a @entity3 problem			2
@entity79 do this too , relating to @entity34 as if we 're primarily poor , immigrant or both			0
it does n't work anymore , if it ever did			0
and although the anti-immigrant rhetoric spouted by @entity85 and others was offensive to @entity8 and projected a " we do n't want you here " image for the @entity67 , the fact is that it was offensive to a lot of other people , too			2
in the age of @entity28 , that kind of exclusive message is just not marketable			2
if @entity3 truly want to develop a winning strategy for appealing to @entity8 , they need look no further than @entity97 and @entity46			1
they appealed to them not as @entity8 or immigrants but as @entity16 with an equal stake in the future of the country			1
what hispanics want , and what we as @entity3 want them to want , is to be included in the @entity16 experience			1
during the period in which @entity8 constituted a small minority of the overall nation , efforts like @entity109 's to ensure that they were counted in the national census were important because it meant inclusion			2
when people believe that they are already part of a community , such patently obvious efforts come across as patronizing			0
hispanics , especially young professionals like me who were born and raised here in the @entity16 , believe that we deserve more than a couple of high - profile meetings and a few @entity129 - language ads. that was certainly true during the 2008 presidential campaign , which had little to interest @entity8 at all			1
@entity42 trumpeted his record as a champion of comprehensive immigration reform to @entity8 , while his campaign tried to make him more palatable to @entity3 conservatives by de-emphasizing his record as a champion of comprehensive immigration reform			1
@entity42 was hurt among @entity34 by the perception that he caved in on immigration enforcement and abandoned his own bill			0
@entity28 's campaign message to @entity8 , though delivered largely in @entity129 through his campaign web site , was patronizing			1
in the summary of issues for his @entity147 , @entity28 talked about a narrow group of issues that , in my view , are important to only a small percentage of @entity34			1
for example , on education , his message focused largely on @entity156 as a second language and in - state tuition for undocumented students			0
on immigration , he tried to counter the @entity3			2
on jobs and the economy , he highlighted the minimum wage			0
these issues , which may have been important to a majority of @entity8 when @entity165 was leading striking farm workers , are not at the top of the list for @entity8 today			1
to remain largely focused on them is to patronize millions of upwardly mobile hispanics who are not immigrants and who do n't think of themselves as hyphenated @entity16			1
which is probably why @entity28 's echoing of @entity165 's " @entity176 ! " during his concession speech after the @entity179 primary was met with silence and blank stares			2
@entity8 political sophistication is increasing alongside @entity8 economic progress			2
a new @entity185 report suggests that the number of @entity8 - owned businesses in the @entity16 will increase to 4.3 million over the next six years			1
we need to appreciate that it is not the message as much as it is the audience			0
speaking past @entity8 or down to @entity8 is not the way to invite them into a long - term relationship			0
we no longer see ourselves as hyphens or as members of the @entity8 community only ; we see ourselves as @entity16 , with a broad array of interests			1
before the development of the virtual world , communities were defined by geography , ethnicity , religion , income , race and other elements that were as apparent to those inside a community as outside it			0
now , through social networking tools like @entity212 and @entity213 , which the @entity28 campaign exploited to new degrees of success , people are developing their own communities of common interest			0
@entity8 want to see the political parties realize that they do , in fact , belong to the larger community called " @entity16 " as well as myriad interest groups			1
we may choose to define ourselves as part of certain " ethnic " or " interest " groups			0
it 's not the job of a political party to define us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity3 are talking about a new outreach to hispanics
she says @entity8 are part of the @entity16 mainstream with broad interests
@entity2 : *candidates* , including @entity28 , talked about narrow issues
she says hispanics want to be seen as @entity16 , with a stake in the future
