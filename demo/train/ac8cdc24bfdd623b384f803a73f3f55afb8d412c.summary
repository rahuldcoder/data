@entity0 -- investigators know roughly where the flames erupted in the engine room of the @entity6 , but it could be a year before they learn what caused the fire , which left the massive ship adrift for days in the @entity11			1
" we know that the fire originated in front of a generator , " @entity12 , a senior marine investigator for the @entity13 , told @entity1 on sunday			1
" you can see the ignition marks on the wall			0
" there are three generators in the engine room where the fire broke out			2
three other generators are in a second engine room that was n't involved in the fire , @entity12 said			2
the same ship encountered a problem in january with its propulsion system , according to a notice posted on the website of carnival senior cruise director @entity32			0
" we 'll know by end of the next week whether the generator is the same one that was having an issue , an anomaly , in january , according to passengers we interviewed from previous cruises , " @entity12 said			0
it could take up to a year to determine the cause of the fire , however , because of the amount of work involved			1
it includes a painstaking analysis of the ship 's records , automated data and wiring			0
the @entity6 was on the third day of a planned four - day cruise from @entity52 , @entity53 , to @entity54 when the fire broke out and brought the trip to a halt			1
it was carrying more than 4,200 people , including 3,100 passengers			0
the loss of power not only crippled the ship but also created smelly conditions			2
toilets stopped working , and waste spilled onto floors and into hallways			0
passengers had to use plastic bags to collect their waste			0
@entity71 described the ship as " a floating toilet , a floating @entity73 , a floating hell " in a lawsuit filed friday against @entity6 for unspecified damages related to the cruise			1
passengers reported long lines for food , shortages of fresh water and widespread boredom			0
many passengers slept in hallways or outside to escape the odors and heat below decks			0
the @entity6 was eventually towed into port in @entity89 , @entity90 , thursday night , and the last passengers disembarked friday			1
the ship is at a @entity89 shipyard for repair and wo n't resume cruises until at least mid-april			1
@entity12 's team remains on board the ship cataloging the location of everything in the engine room where the fire started			1
he said investigators are still working on lighting the room because the ship is operating on temporary power from a generator on the dock			1
it 's likely that @entity6 will make repairs on the ship in @entity89 , where the investigation is taking place , @entity12 said			1
however , a @entity6 spokesman says no decision has been made on a schedule or location for repairs			1
on saturday , carnival crew members were bused to and from the ship to help with the clean up			0
one housekeeper told @entity1 it was n't pleasant work but said it had to be done , and the crew was willing to do it			0
passengers have praised the crew for its response during the ordeal			0
sewage , gray water and all waste generated during a cruise are stored in tanks and removed at the end of each trip , according to @entity12			0
because the @entity6 is a @entity139 - flagged vessel , the @entity137 is the primary investigative agency and will work with the @entity13 and the @entity140			1
investigators pulled the voyage data recorder , a device that records alarms , voice communications on the bridge , engine speed , navigation information and rudder angle , @entity12 said			2
it appears that the fire suppression worked as designed , @entity12 said friday			2
the engineer who was on watch around dawn february 10 saw the fire ignite over a video feed and immediately notified the bridge , @entity12 said			2
based on an inspection of the engine room thursday , @entity12 said the fire did not appear to have been large			0
as compensation , @entity6 offered each passenger $ 500 , a free flight home , a full refund for the trip and for most expenses incurred onboard , and credit for another cruise .			1

investigators now know roughly where the fire started
it could still be a year before they know the cause
the fire cut power to the @entity6 and left it adrift for days
the @entity6 is now in @entity89 , @entity90 , for repairs
