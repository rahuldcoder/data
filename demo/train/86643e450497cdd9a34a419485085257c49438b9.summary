-- the latest name thrown in the ring for an " x factor " judges spot : singer @entity4			1
sources say @entity4 is interested in joining the @entity7 reality hit , with one source adding that she 's met with " factor " co-producer @entity9 about the gig and other opportunities			1
" @entity14 " chief @entity13 is seeking to fill the judges panel spots vacated by @entity16 and @entity17 before the second season starts production later this year			1
sources say he 'll most likely hire two female talents to join himself and music producer @entity22 for a gender - balanced panel			1
@entity13 has not made firm offers for the posts , the list of candidates continue to shift and official outlets continue to decline comment			2
but @entity30 could make sense on a few levels for " @entity14			1
" first , she would add country music expertise , like @entity35 provides for @entity37 's " @entity36			1
" that could also boost the show 's ratings since country music award shows have been one of the few tv genres to have successfully grown their audience in recent years			1
@entity30 also knows what it 's like to compete in a tv talent competition , she first gained national attention when she was eight years old by becoming a finalist on @entity50 in 1991			2
@entity51 , @entity4 ' personal life , marriage to @entity54 and weight issues -- while polarizing -- have also drawn plenty of headlines , which would spur press coverage of the show			2
@entity4 performed a tearful tribute at a concert last week to @entity62 , who @entity13 considered for an " @entity14 " gig before her death on february 11			1
another name recently floating about for the factor judges panel : " @entity14 " @entity68 judge @entity67			2
the @entity70 press have reported yesterday @entity67 is quitting the @entity68 series to " focus on her solo career in the @entity74 , " though sources say none of the @entity68 spots have been decided yet			0
and the former @entity79 star recently declared she 'd be interested in switching to the @entity74 version			0
" it would be awesome to be a judge over here for ' @entity14 , ' " she told @entity81			0
" i really enjoyed my time over in the @entity68 being a judge			0
" other names circulating for " @entity14 " posts include singers ranging from @entity90 to @entity91			0
@entity13 , @entity9 and @entity7 declined comment , but you can expect more " x factor " judges news later today			0
