@entity0 -- it 's a historic event taking place on an international stage that 's been seven years and $ 40 billion in the making			1
the @entity6 , known as the @entity7 , is shrouded in smog on opening day of the @entity9			0
opening ceremonies last week of the @entity9 were lauded as the most spectacular in history , with pyrotechnics blasting from the top of @entity16 , @entity10 's @entity6 and a synchronized fireworks display firing off across the capital			1
what has been mostly absent from @entity16 , however , are protests			0
although a unified @entity10 is the image that country 's government is eager to portray , many human rights groups allege that @entity10 has orchestrated a massive cover - up			1
beyond human rights , questions remain about whether @entity10 has kept its promises to the world to improve in two other major areas of reform : freedom of the press and pollution cleanup			1
human rights " in the run up to the @entity38 , it seems that @entity10 authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of ' stability ' and ' harmony ' ... that they have really come down quite hard on human right 's activists and lawyers , " said @entity33 , @entity34 director for @entity35			1
in its report " @entity10 : the @entity38 countdown -- broken promises , " @entity35 details what it calls a systematic persecution of dissident voices in @entity16 and throughout @entity10			1
" the @entity10 authorities have used the @entity38 and the cleanup before the @entity38 as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re-education through labor , " @entity33 said			1
" what that really means is that they 're punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson ... and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the @entity10 government have instead been rounded up			0
" the @entity35 report cites other human rights violations leading up to the @entity38			1
@entity35 accuses the @entity10 government of using surveillance and detention to pursue family members of activists and blocking protesters from traveling to the capital city from other areas , such as @entity10 's @entity77 province , which was devastated by an earthquake in may that claimed the lives of nearly 70,000 people			0
the @entity10 foreign ministry criticized the @entity83 report , saying it had a biased attitude toward @entity10			0
@entity86 spokesman @entity85 was quoted by @entity87 in a news briefing saying , " we hope [ @entity35 ] can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see @entity10 in an objective way			2
" @entity16 secured the @entity38 in 2001 amid some controversy , with a tacit acknowledgment of concerns over its record on human rights , press freedom and environmental pollution			1
even the day before the host city was announced , @entity99 , then secretary general of the @entity100 , said @entity10 was committed to change			0
" we are confident that the games coming to @entity10 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions , including education , health and human rights , " @entity99 said			1
" we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to @entity10			2
" press freedom however , it was quite a different story for reporters as they arrived at the @entity38 press center in @entity16			1
they discovered that many web sites had been blocked , such as those with information about @entity119 protests , @entity120 , @entity121 or the @entity122			0
internet sites are severely regulated throughout @entity10 , and limited access to some of the sites was granted only after reporters complained to the @entity128			0
the same official who assured the international media of " complete freedom " in 2001 took a somewhat different tone last week			2
" yes , we promised to provide free access to the @entity135 , except for a few [ web sites ] that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people , " said @entity99 , who is now the executive vice president of @entity16 's @entity38 organizing committee			1
in a statement provided to @entity141 , @entity99 said , " as in any other country , there are some kinds of limitations ... however , i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games			0
" critics of @entity10 's policy on a free press said the problems run much deeper than the lack of access to some web sites from the @entity156			1
" @entity10 's political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable ... this goes for the @entity10 people and the foreign journalists , " said @entity157 , director of the @entity158 at the @entity159			2
" [ @entity10 ] is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself , the @entity167 could be endangered or even be threatened			0
" foreign journalists in @entity10 for the @entity38 complain that access to report on anything that extends beyond sporting events has been severely limited			1
@entity157 points to the recent beating and detention of two @entity176 journalists who were investigating an alleged terrorist attack in northwestern @entity10 as a sign of a government that is not used to a free press			1
" they also feel since they got the @entity38 , the world is coming anyway by this point , they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior , " @entity157 said			2
@entity10 officials later apologized for the beating incident			0
pollution a third major commitment by @entity10 in its @entity38 bid was to clean up pollution in @entity16			1
although government readings on pollution have gone down in the years since @entity10 won the bid , they still routinely far exceed @entity201 guidelines			1
and at least one @entity203 - based environmental consultant believes that @entity10 has purposely manipulated its own pollution statistics to give a false impression that more progress has been made			2
" @entity16 's public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign , " said @entity207 , author of a scientific report on @entity10 's air quality and two opinion - editorials on the topic for the @entity213 edition of @entity214			2
@entity207 cites the closure of two air quality monitoring stations in heavily trafficked areas of @entity16 in 2006 as the reason why the number of " @entity222 days " increased in the past two years			2
the @entity222 program was instituted by the governments in major cities across @entity10 as a system to measure acceptable levels of pollution			0
the criteria for a " @entity222 day " are still below what many industrialized countries consider good air quality			0
when the program was launched in 1998 , @entity16 had only 100 " @entity222 days , " but last year , that figure rose to 246 , a report the @entity10 state media hailed as a major improvement			2
when asked about the allegations that air quality monitoring stations were shut down , @entity237 , the deputy head of the @entity238 , said , " this phenomenon does not exist , " according to @entity241			0
@entity10 officials did not respond to @entity1 's request for an interview			0
despite official assurances that the air is safe for competition , athletes and fans have expressed concern over the thick smog covering the entire city			0
the @entity254 went so far as to issue a warning to those attending the games			0
" individuals traveling to the @entity9 should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in @entity16 ... [ and ] limit or avoid outdoor exercise , " it said			0
beyond highlighting the discrepancies between @entity10 's promises and actual reform , critics interviewed by @entity1 about all three major areas shared one common sentiment : disappointment			0
" this is really a significant opportunity lost for the @entity10 government to show to the world that they really trust their own people ... a sign of a @entity10 that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world , " said @entity35 's @entity33 .			1

@entity10 has spent $ 40 billion , seven years planning for 2008 @entity38
in 2001 , @entity10 promised to improve human rights , press freedom and pollution
@entity16 official : free @entity135 jeopardizes national security , *detrimental* to youth
*experts* disappointed in ' significant opportunity lost ' for reform , improve world view
