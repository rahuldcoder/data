-- fresh faced and full of energy , five recent graduates sit around the conference room table			2
they all hail from a different @entity5 country , and they all have big dreams about revamping education in their continent for a digital era			1
these are the headquarters of @entity13 in @entity14 , an online training platform that 's been partnering with universities in @entity5 to provide short e-courses for users			1
helped by a single private investor , the tech education portal is looking to harness a growing demand for online learning by allowing students to log into classes remotely			1
" at @entity13 , we develop learning management systems and provide content development services to higher institutions to take their courses online so that the general public can access them at a cheaper price , " says @entity26 - born @entity25 , one of @entity13 's founders			1
the flexibility that comes with e-learning is just one of the many reasons @entity25 says the online education tool has found success			1
" it 's responsive to the students ' schedules , " says the 22 - year - old entrepreneur			0
" but also managers who want to do courses but are too busy to do them can now use [ @entity13 ] and sign in when they get back from work and access the resources online			1
" @entity25 came up with the concept for @entity13 -- which means " to learn " in @entity49 -- at university when he found he could n't take school home			1
he had hoped to start the company in his homeland of @entity26 , but the obstacles were too great			0
" it was very difficult because they were not digitally ready , " he recalls			0
" they did not understand what i was trying to do			0
the second problem i faced was internet penetration in the country			0
i thought @entity5 was more stable so @entity63 had a higher chance of success there because many people already have the @entity68			1
" alongside four other young entrepreneurs -- @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , @entity73 ( @entity74 ) , @entity75 ( @entity5 ) and @entity76 ( @entity77 ) -- the e-learning portal took shape and each founder provided a different perspective for the startup			1
none are over the age of 25 , yet these innovators are simply doing what is natural to the millennial generation -- using technology to find solutions to problems they 've experienced			0
" we bring together the problems we 've seen in different parts of @entity5 and we are all trying to create together solutions to the problems we have experienced in different parts of the continent , " says @entity25			1
he adds : " i was aware of user experience because user experience of technology in @entity26 was not very good			0
one of the other partners was keen on developing the mobile application because he said in his area of the world , there are more mobile users			0
so we are bringing together solutions made by the problems we 've faced in @entity5			2
" @entity25 explains that @entity13 offers a free mobile app that can be downloaded to a user 's smartphone			1
students can access the e-learning portal via a keycode provided by the university they are registered to			1
" at the moment , [ mobile ] is very limited			0
mobile phones are good for getting your results , educators checking attendance reports and all that stuff			0
but the real core experience is from the desktop machine			0
" since its launch in 2009 , @entity13 has been recognized by several international bodies , including the @entity127 and the @entity128			2
it has also received a number of accolades , including the " @entity135 " award at the @entity134 's @entity133 in 2012 and @entity137 's " @entity136 " prize			0
looking ahead , @entity25 has big plans for the startup			2
" our major goal is to be a major education technology provider in @entity5 , " he says			1
" so we 're just trying to strategically position ourselves , so when @entity5 is ready we would also be ready			2
" for the time being however , the company 's main focus is creating sustainable growth before proceeding to roll out the platform across the continent			0
as for @entity25 , the passionate @entity26 says he is determined to keep on working to help increase accessibility to education in the continent			1
" the future of the continent lies in how educated people are , " he says			0
" all the major problems can be solved with education -- education is the key to the future			2
" more from @entity5 start - up			2

@entity25 founded @entity13 , an e-learning tool with four other young graduates
offers students short courses with flexibility , remote access through @entity5 schools
@entity25 says success is *due* to a strong founding team , playing to *strengths*
