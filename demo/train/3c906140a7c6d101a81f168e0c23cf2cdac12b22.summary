issues and that she has little confidence that recent changes to the @entity10 will prevent discrimination in the future			1
@entity13 's @entity0 , who retired in 2012 after a glittering career which included @entity10 gold and seven world championship titles , claims the @entity2 should have taken a firmer stance in the controversial build - up to 2014 @entity19 in @entity20			1
ahead of the @entity22 , @entity7 supporters were outraged when the @entity24 government passed a law in june 2013 prohibiting " gay propaganda			1
" the law says it is a crime to publicly acknowledge that you are gay , provide information on homosexuality to minors , or publicly support equal rights for gays			2
@entity0 told @entity1 's @entity35 program that the @entity2 , which at the time released a statement saying it had " received assurances from the highest level of government in @entity24 that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the @entity22 , " had effectively ducked the issue			1
" the @entity2 had a huge responsibility in @entity20 and they did n't stand up for human rights , " she said			1
" they were hiding from the difficult questions			0
i think at that point they made a lot of wrong choices			0
" @entity0 admitted that she had severe misgivings about going to the @entity22 for her work as a @entity13 tv analyst and claimed she was not alone			1
" i think a lot of athletes were very uncomfortable			0
i even figured if i should go or not			0
" but i made a choice to go			0
and i stood for being a gay person and i had my family there , i had my son and my wife			2
i did n't feel like @entity24 should choose the way i live			0
" @entity0 also believes that her own sport 's ruling body , the @entity65 , ( @entity65 ) needs to step up to the plate and better support gay athletes			1
" even in alpine skiing i think it 's not talked about enough			1
from the athlete 's side i think it 's really hard to speak up at the @entity74 and i think that 's where we have to have changes , " she added			2
in the wake of the controversy , the @entity2 announced earlier this month that it had made an amendment to the @entity10 to specifically include the wording " sexual orientation			1
" principle 6 of the charter now reads : " the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this @entity10 shall be secured without discrimination of any kind , such as race , color , sex , sexual orientation , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status			1
" @entity2 president @entity102 of @entity103 described the change as " a very important first step " following a unanimous vote in favor of the move			1
" we have to look into the future and try to address the challenges which may arise in the future and the challenges we have already now , " he added			0
but @entity0 is not convinced this change is sufficient to ensure that future hosts of the @entity19 are held accountable by the @entity2 for breaches of human rights			1
" hopefully they have learned from @entity119 and will get better in the future , " she said			0
@entity0 , who was a member of the @entity120 , is also calling for her own sport and the @entity2 to freshen up its membership to better reflect modern views			1
" they do n't really follow the new developments , " she believes			0
" i hope that both in the @entity2 and other sports that the younger generation get more influence because we have a different mindset , " she added			1
" @entity22 themselves should be open to all , free of discrimination , and that applies to spectators , officials , media , and , of course , athletes , " said the @entity2 in statement			1
" we oppose in the strongest terms any move that would jeopardize this principle			0
" during the @entity119 @entity2 president @entity102 obtained explicit assurances from the very highest level that there would no discrimination against any participant in the @entity22 and this was fully observed			2
" the 33 - year - old can certainly look back on a stunningly successful career -- a twice winner of coveted overall @entity155 title -- in addition to her triumphs at world and @entity10 level			1
but all the while she kept her sexuality a closely guarded secret and it was only on retiring from her sport that she put an end to persistent rumors and revealed that she was gay			2
in june 2012 , a few months after her farewell race , @entity0 went on @entity13 public radio to announce that she had been in a relationship with her partner @entity169 , whom she first met in 2005			1
" i never started to believe that i was gay when i was young , " she told @entity1			2
" this just happened when i met my wife			0
she was married and i had a boyfriend			0
our lives were just thrown upside down			0
" the timing of the announcement was a dilemma , @entity0 admits and they had been worried about the reaction it would receive			2
" we were nervous of course , how people would respond			0
it was important for us to build our atmosphere , our family , our house , our castle before we let everybody else into our life			0
" i think why i did n't choose to announce it when i was still racing was that i wanted to be a hundred per cent focused on my races			0
" the pair formally tied the knot and were married earlier this year and have a two - year - old son , @entity196			2
@entity0 was trained to her biggest successes by her father @entity198 , her peak achievement coming in 2007 on the home snow of @entity201 , where she grabbed a stunning three gold medals , a silver and a bronze in the world championships			2
it came at the end of a difficult season , but after being urged by him to take a short break from training everything clicked into gear			0
" i had about 10 days to mentally prepare to believe that my skiing was good enough to win that gold medal			0
my dad told me ' go home , go to your friends , do whatever for two days and come back '			0
" when she did , @entity0 proved unstoppable across all the disciplines to dominate the competition			2
@entity201 was the venue for this weekend 's @entity155 competition , and although retired , @entity0 has been taking a keen interest in the proceedings			1
she has seen compatriot @entity225 provide home cheer by taking the slalom title saturday			0
@entity225 edged out overall @entity155 leader @entity228 of @entity229 by just 0.06secs			0
another @entity13 , @entity230 , was third 0.32secs off the pace , with @entity10 champion @entity233 of the @entity234 back in fourth after a poor first run			1
the in - form @entity228 , who had many battles with @entity0 's during the @entity13 's career , won the giant slalom friday from another home hope hope , @entity240 .			1

@entity13 's @entity0 is a six - time @entity10 medalist
@entity0 retired from alpine skiing in 2012
she is openly gay and is married with a child
