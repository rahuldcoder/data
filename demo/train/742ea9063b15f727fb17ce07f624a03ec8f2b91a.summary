-- if you 've ever had a group of friends who have meant the world to you , take a look at the old black - and - white photo that accompanies today 's column			1
if you 've ever yearned to freeze time , to make the finest moments of your life stand still in their tracks so you can savor them a little longer , while knowing somewhere inside that such a thing is impossible , take a look at the faces of those three men			2
not so many years before that photo was snapped , the three of them were inseparable -- not only on a basketball court , but in the minds of hundreds of thousands , maybe millions , of admirers			1
their names routinely appeared in the same sentences in newspaper sports sections from coast to coast			2
they inhabited the same column of agate - type box scores on winter morning after winter morning			2
if you were young enough -- and , as the 12 - year - old statistics kid who counted up their field goals , rebounds and free throws for the local @entity39 , @entity38 , television station that did the live broadcasts of their college games , i was young enough -- you allowed yourself to believe that the three friends would always be together			1
it was n't to be			2
it almost never is , whether you are friends as famous as they were , or as anonymous as most of the rest of us are			1
which is why i love that bittersweet photograph so much			2
it is an inadvertent record of a moment that signifies how all friends , eventually , must take different paths , that nothing beautiful is destined to endure uninterrupted			1
on the left in the photograph is @entity58 of the @entity59			2
in the center is @entity61 of the @entity62			0
on the right is @entity64 of the @entity59			0
in 1960 , the three had been teammates on the @entity67 basketball team that won the national collegiate championship			1
it was quite a squad ; the coach was @entity71 , the two other starters were @entity73 and @entity74 , and there was a sharpshooting forward who came off the bench , a rather intense young man by the name of @entity80			0
the team was so smooth that , watching from the stands , you sensed they could read each others ' minds			1
if you had never before quite understood what it looked like and felt like to be a part of a seamless unit , you found out every evening just by seeing them play			0
but the thing you could never really know -- the secret that belonged only to them , as it does with any group of friends -- was what it was like to be inside of it			1
they were separate people , but they were one			0
which is why the photograph of them taken barely three years later -- it was shot on october 17 , 1963 , in the @entity103 -- is , in its low - key way , so mesmerizing			0
the friends , because of circumstance , have parted			1
this was to be the first game during which , as professionals , they competed against each other			0
the old team was history			1
at the opening tipoff , their goals were about to diverge			0
the photo was snapped by a then - young man named @entity119 , who had been taken to the game by his father , sportswriter @entity121			0
@entity119 sent it to me recently because he thought i would understand			0
fifty winters ago -- the winter that @entity61 and @entity64 and @entity58 and their @entity67 teammates won their national championship -- i somehow , as a junior high school student who was n't even that good at math , talked the local television play - by - play man , @entity130 , into letting me sit with him and help with the statistics			1
i watched those friends on the court at every home game on their way to the championship ; i watched that magical basketball friendship form and grow and become so strong that their team became the finest in the country			1
what must it be like to be part of a friendship that is played out so publicly -- part of hardwood recollections woven into the fabric of the lives of strangers who will never meet you ? " it 's probably something the rest of us can never fully comprehend , " said @entity154 , a sports historian who wrote the book " the @entity156 of @entity157 , " and who knows every member of that championship team			1
" but i can tell you that the bond between them is real , and that they wear it very well			0
it goes way beyond basketball			0
" most of us , if we are lucky enough when we are young to have friends whom we treasure , tend to lose track of some of them over time			1
most of us have our own versions of that moment in the photograph : a moment when we suddenly know for sure that , despite our dreams and best intentions , the golden days when we first found each other have drifted off , and that we are on our way to somewhere else , somewhere different			0
but there always is the chance that we can recapture the memories			0
later this month , in @entity39 , the living members of that championship team will gather for a series of 50th anniversary celebrations			1
the three men in the photograph are all expected to be present			0
they started off as small - town @entity38 boys who did n't even know that the others were alive : @entity61 of @entity194 , @entity58 of @entity195 , @entity64 of @entity196			0
they ended up as a part of each other			0
that 's the lesson for all of us , as this new year takes its first faltering steps , and , all across the country , new friendships form and old ones seem to splinter			1
that 's the lesson , full of hope and harmony : the best friendships never truly die			2
we may go our separate ways , for a while			0
but the friendships not only lead the way home			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			1

three players on 1960 college championship team went on to the @entity225
@entity221 says the three seemingly inseparable players were parted
he says they plan to *reunite* at 50th anniversary *reunion* later this month
the best friendships endure even though friends get parted , @entity221 says
