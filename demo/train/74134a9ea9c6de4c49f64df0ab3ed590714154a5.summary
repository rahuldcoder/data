the @entity0 accidentally revealed the name of the @entity3 's top intelligence official in @entity4 to some 6,000 journalists			1
the person was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for president @entity10 during his surprise visit to @entity12 in @entity4 on sunday			1
it 's common for such lists to be given to the media , but names of intelligence officials are rarely provided			1
in this case , the individual 's name was listed next to the title , " chief of station			0
" the print pool reporter -- a journalist allowed access to or is given information about an event who relays it to the rest of the media -- copied and pasted the list that was provided by the @entity0			1
print pool reports are then distributed by the @entity0 press office , which does not edit them , to a large list of media			1
in this case , the same reporter , @entity38 , the @entity0 bureau chief for the @entity39 , noticed the unusual entry after the list was distributed and then checked it out with officials			2
the @entity0 followed up and distributed a shorter list from a different reporter that did not include the station chief 's name			2
in his account to @entity50 , @entity38 said when they arrived in @entity4 , he asked @entity0 officials for a list of who would be briefing the president			1
a @entity0 official then asked the military for a list to provide to the pool of journalists			2
the official got an e-mail back from the military with a subject line , " manifest for briefing for @entity65 , " @entity38 told @entity50			0
that e-mail was forwarded to @entity38 and he proceeded to copy and paste that list for the pool report			0
he then sent it to the @entity0 official , who sent the report to the distribution list			2
after the initial report had been issued , @entity38 noticed that the chief of station had been identified in the list , which he flagged to the @entity0 official			1
after checking with the military , the @entity0 official said , " this is a problem			2
" the official asked if @entity38 would write another pool report , asking journalists to disregard the previous report that contained the list with the chief of station 's name			2
@entity38 said he was open to the request and sent the @entity0 a new report			0
he said he was unsure whether that report was distributed			0
the new list , @entity38 said , was distributed by a separate pool report that included details from @entity10 's speech to the troops			1
that report included a shorter list of names with a note saying , " this is the correct list of participants			0
" privately administration officials are alarmed about the incident , but so far the @entity0 and @entity3 officials have declined to comment publicly			0
a station chief heads the @entity3 's office in a foreign country , establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities			0
the identity of station chiefs , like most @entity3 officers , are rarely disclosed to protect them and their ability to operate secretly			0
given the potentially dangerous nature of the situation , @entity50 has not broadcast or published online the name of the official			0
in the most recent case before this one , the @entity116 administration infamously leaked the name of former @entity3 officer @entity119 to a journalist in 2003			0
@entity119 tweeted on monday that the @entity0 's mistake this past weekend is " astonishing			1
" top @entity123 spy pulled from @entity124 after terror threats			1

@entity119 tweets that this weekend 's *misstep* was " astonishing "
the name of the top @entity123 intelligence official in @entity4 was on a list given to the media
the @entity0 issued the list for president @entity10 's trip to @entity4
