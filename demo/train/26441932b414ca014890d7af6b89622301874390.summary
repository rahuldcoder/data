@entity0 -- when @entity3 pop artist @entity2 visited @entity4 in 1982 and was told there was n't a @entity6 's , he replied : " oh , but they will			1
" twenty - six years after his death , @entity2 , whose much - lauded prescience extended across visual and consumer culture , has popped up in @entity13 once again -- and he was right about the fast - food chain			1
" @entity2 : 15 minutes eternal , " the first major retrospective of his work in @entity13 , recently arrived in @entity15 with the aim of acquainting the @entity13 public with the artist who created some of the most famous paintings of the most iconic figure in the country 's history			1
@entity2 goes to @entity13 while @entity2 's trip to @entity4 was his first and only visit to mainland @entity13 , his engagement with the country started a decade earlier , inspired by former @entity3 president @entity31 's rapprochement with the communist power in 1972			1
ripping from the headlines , @entity2 adopted chairman @entity34 as his subject , applying his signature pop aesthetic to @entity13 's paramount leader			1
his series of portraits went on to become some of his most well - known works			0
" @entity34 was front - page news in @entity3 and that was often where @entity2 got his biggest inspiration , " said @entity41 , director of @entity43 's @entity42 , which organized the exhibition			1
he described @entity34 as " classic warhol subject matter			0
" @entity2 relied on a copy of @entity34 's portrait photograph in the leader 's @entity53 of ideological quotations to create his paintings			2
little did he know that he would eventually pose for a photo in front of the original portrait hanging in @entity4 's @entity60			0
his trip to @entity4 was an unexpected byproduct of a visit to @entity0			0
the industrialist @entity64 had invited him to the city to attend the opening of a night club , decorated with portraits of @entity70 's @entity69 and princess @entity71 that he had commissioned from the artist			0
upon @entity2 's arrival , @entity64 announced he had arranged a vip tour to @entity4 for him and his friends			1
artistic inspiration aside , @entity13 also provided @entity2 with a respite from the pressures of fame			1
" it was one of the special places , " said @entity80 , the artist 's close friend and personal photographer , who accompanied him to @entity13			2
he recalled that @entity2 went virtually unrecognized in @entity13 , although the artist stood out for his unusual looks			1
" as @entity2 would say , he did n't have to wear his @entity2 suit			0
notoriety and fame is a double - edged sword ...			0
" @entity13 's communist uniformity , with its blue sea of unisex @entity34 suits , appealed to @entity2 's aesthetic obsession with repetition			1
" he was all about multiples ... and at the time , @entity13 was the ultimate multiple , " @entity99 said			0
the country also provided a source of inspiration for @entity2 's nascent modeling career			1
@entity2 posed for @entity99 ' camera with gestures he adopted from the tai chi practitioners he observed outdoors -- and even adopted the bared - teeth expression of the guardian lion in the @entity112 in one photo			2
can @entity2 make a name in @entity13 ? while @entity2 is well - known within art and fashion circles in @entity13 ( @entity41 said 600 of these cultural elite attended the exhibition 's pre-opening ) , he remains unknown to the average @entity13 citizen			1
many @entity13 are familiar with certain @entity2 works , such as the @entity122 or the chairman @entity34 portraits , reproductions of which dot cafes and tourist markets across @entity4			1
but they are much less likely to connect the work with the artist -- or to even have heard of the artist himself			2
" if you do n't know who @entity2 is , i wo n't blame you			0
but if you say you 've never seen his @entity122 portrait , i would have to jump into the @entity139 river and kill myself ! " wrote user @entity134 on @entity135			0
a search on @entity13 's popular @entity142 - like platform revealed many posts by users expressing ignorance of whom @entity2 was or why he is famous			1
having recently launched a " massive " advertising campaign and sat for dozens of interviews with mainland media outlets , @entity41 is hoping to reach the masses			0
" one of the reasons why i wanted to do this show is so the general public can learn about the artist behind these iconic works and realize ( @entity34 and @entity122 ) are just a few of thousands of images he made , " he said			1
so far , it appears that this education is welcome -- and necessary			0
" for the first time , i learned the charm of pop art , " @entity135 user @ @entity161 wrote about the exhibition , while user @ @entity168 posted , " just saw @entity2 's exhibition and i got a little confused			1
for example , i did n't understand the @entity170			0
" " the curiosity is greater than the awareness , " said @entity171 , international director for post-war and contemporary art at @entity174 , which is holding its second private sale of @entity2 's work in @entity0 this week			1
" we 've seen a great deal of interest and curiosity ( among @entity13 ) about @entity185 art and international culture			0
i think @entity2 is a perfect artist ... to show what @entity185 culture is all about			2
" @entity174 's first private @entity2 sale in @entity0 last november attracted a mostly @entity190 demographic and managed to sell nearly half of its lots , @entity171 said			2
censoring @entity34 in @entity13 however , visitors to the " @entity196 " exhibitions in mainland @entity13 will not see any chairman @entity34 portraits			0
while @entity41 was planning the exhibition with the host venue -- the @entity15 power station of art -- its staff advised that exhibiting the @entity34 works was n't a " good idea right now			0
" a staff member told @entity1 that government authorities would have considered the works " too political			0
" " of course , the primary concern is to get the show there and up and not put anything in a category that would ever question anything , " @entity41 said			0
" knowing that we would have the censors from the @entity214 , we wanted to make sure ... that nothing would put the show in jeopardy			0
" an editorial in the state - backed @entity220 newspaper suggested that while @entity2 may not have had ill intent , the " provocative " blotches of color splattered on @entity34 's face suggested that he was wearing make - up -- a disrespectful portrayal of the iconic leader			2
while @entity41 acknowledged the @entity34 portraits " could be read as a sarcastic or ironic portrayal " , he said @entity2 " definitely was n't being critical			0
he always liked to blur the lines on gender , and making colorful men somewhat beautiful was something that he liked to do as an inside joke , " he added			0
once the @entity13 public gains a deeper understanding of @entity2 's work , he expects that the @entity34 works " wo n't be as big a deal			1
" influence on @entity13 contemporary art @entity2 's influence on @entity13 contemporary art can actually be traced back to 1981 , when many contemporary artists , labeled as dissidents , fled the country , @entity41 said			1
while most of them went to @entity251 and @entity252 , two artists " very specifically went to @entity246 because they wanted quite literally to be part of @entity2 's universe " -- @entity254 and @entity255			1
both artists have gone on to become some of the most recognized and celebrated names in @entity13 contemporary art , and some would go as far as calling @entity254 " @entity13 's @entity2			1
" " @entity254 loves the idea of multiples , " @entity99 pointed out , noting @entity254 's most famous installations , including the 9,000 backpacks representing the schoolchildren killed in the 2008 @entity262 earthquake , and the millions of porcelain sunflower seeds he poured into the @entity264 of @entity267 's @entity266 museum			2
@entity41 readily concurred : " he 's really gone on to model his entire art - making process and career on proven @entity2 tactics , looking at repetition , multiplication , and critique of consumer culture			2
when you look at his @entity279 works , that 's directly related to @entity2 and it 's really amazing how many things he picked up from @entity282			2
" @entity254 's similarity to @entity2 also lies in his social activism , which aims to change @entity13 society through art , he added			1
as for @entity255 , viewers may not immediately see @entity2 in his work , @entity41 said , but he described the artist as a " huge fan of @entity2 " who " loves the idea of repetition -- the formal arrangement of @entity13 character after @entity13 character , an endless array of similar looking imagery			1
" unfortunately , neither artist became acquainted in person with their muse , despite moving to @entity246 for him			0
@entity254 once spotted @entity2 at a party , but did not approach him , @entity41 revealed			2
" as a young man , he was too shy to actually go and say hello , " he said , recalling that @entity254 told him his @entity304 was n't good enough at the time			0
@entity254 and @entity255 aside , the @entity2 aesthetic and vocabulary has deeply influenced @entity13 contemporary artists over the past 10 - 15 years , with its characteristic combinations of social realist imagery with pop culture and iconic brands			1
the @entity15 exhibition will run to july 28 and make its way to @entity4 later this year			0
meanwhile , @entity80 will also hold an exhibition of his photographs of @entity2 next month in @entity15 , including images from their 1982 trip to @entity13			1
" his work lives on			0
maybe ( the @entity13 ) do n't know him , but they know his work , " @entity80 said , predicting that @entity2 " will get bigger and bigger in @entity13			2
" " @entity2 was the ultimate pop artist			1
to this day you can still find @entity325 soup on the shelf in the grocery store and you can see multiples of them , " @entity80 said			0
" as long as that imagery is live and well , @entity2 will have this built - in publicity			2
" @entity1 's @entity333 contributed to this report .			0

first major retrospective of pop artist @entity2 's work exhibiting in @entity13
