@entity0 , @entity1 -- all 12 of @entity1 's oil refineries have reopened after being shut down for two weeks or more following a series of massive union - led actions protesting the government 's planned pension overhaul			1
strikes ended friday at all six of @entity12 's refineries , according to a spokesman for that company			1

@entity18 , a spokesman for the @entity19 of @entity20 , said industry leaders planned to meet friday afternoon to discuss the situation			2
