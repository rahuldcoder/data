@entity0 , @entity1 -- tensions among @entity1 , @entity4 and the @entity5 jumped a notch monday , with @entity1 's prime minister warning there would be " no more business as usual " with @entity13 after @entity10 aircraft killed two dozen @entity1 troops			1

in his @entity2 interview , @entity14 highlighted incidents such as the killing of the @entity1 troops and a @entity5 raid into @entity1 to kill @entity45 as violations of his country 's sovereignty			1
" you can not win any war without the support of the masses ... and such sort of incidents makes people move away from this situation , " he said			0
@entity1 is a vital land supply route into @entity4 for the @entity5 and its allies , and a key partner in the battle against @entity59 and its aligned jihadist movements			1
but @entity1 authorities turned back 300 trucks carrying @entity10 supplies and fuel into @entity4 on monday , and the prime minister said his government had not yet decided whether to boycott an upcoming @entity68 conference on the future of @entity4			1
details of saturday 's deadly raid remained unclear monday , and the chief of @entity5 forces in the region named an @entity76 general from the military 's @entity77 to lead an investigation			2
gen. @entity80 ordered the investigating officer , @entity81			0
gen. @entity82 , to report back to him by december 23			0
according to two senior @entity5 officials with direct knowledge of initial reporting on the incident , the probe is focusing on what coordination failures occurred before the airstrike			0
one of the officials said initial reports indicate @entity5 and @entity4 forces said shots were fired across the border from @entity1 , noting that it is a known tactic of insurgents to fire into @entity4 from very close to @entity1 border checkpoints because they believe it will give them sanctuary			1
the @entity5 believes the @entity1 " were called " before @entity10 opened fire , the official said , but he added that " at this point , we just do n't know exactly what coordination was done			1
" a @entity10 official said @entity4 troops were working with elements of @entity5 special operations forces in a combined mission on the @entity4 side of the border			1
@entity1 military spokesman maj. gen. @entity110 denied the reports that @entity1 troops had prompted the attack saturday by firing on the @entity10 helicopters			1
speaking by phone to @entity1 's @entity116 , @entity110 said @entity10 helicopters fired first on the @entity1 military checkpoints			1
@entity110 said the soldiers notified @entity1 military headquarters , which informed @entity10 authorities immediately			2
the spokesman said @entity1 soldiers fired at the @entity10 aircraft in retaliation			1
speaking in @entity126 , the chairman of the @entity128 , gen. @entity129 , acknowledged that the @entity5 - @entity1 relationship was " troubled			2
" but he suggested it would survive once the two nations work through the " real tragedy " of the @entity1 deaths			0
" we 've had other moments before , " @entity129 said			0
" i 'm hopeful that with the relationships we 've built leader - to - leader and worked at over the past years , that we can find our way forward			0
but i understand the anger			0
" the @entity144 offered its condolences to @entity1 , while @entity147 spokesman @entity146 said @entity13 was concerned about the impact the incident could have on relations with @entity1			0
" the relationship is vitally important to both countries			0
we both face a shared threat from extremists			0
... we 're taking this very seriously , " he said			0
a @entity5 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told @entity2 that @entity1 remains a " critical " partner in counterterrorism , " and we do not anticipate significant changes in that relationship			1
" the @entity1 @entity33 appeared to try to widen the rift monday			1
a spokesman for the fundamentalist @entity168 movement , @entity169 , said in a phone call to @entity2 that the @entity5 will infringe on @entity1 's sovereignty and continue operations on @entity1 soil in the coming days			2
@entity169 said @entity1 must respond in kind to the @entity10 attacks , and he warned that the @entity1 @entity33 will continue jihad as long as @entity1 remains an ally of the @entity5			1
in @entity180 , meanwhile , a senior adviser to president @entity37 said @entity4 and @entity1 may be on a course toward military conflict			1
@entity183 said the link between @entity1 and the assassination of a former @entity4 president had united his country " against interference			2
" @entity183 accused @entity1 of harboring and assisting the insurgency in @entity4 , and said his country 's neighbor probably helped the suicide bomber who killed former @entity4 president @entity193 in september			1
" the assassination of president @entity193 has gelled the nation together against interference			0
and one or two more actions could put us in an irreversible course ( toward ) conflict			0
and we 've shown through our history that we are a match for any invader , " he said			0
the two nations have been trading accusations in the border regions in the past few months , with @entity1 accusing the @entity4 of harboring militants and @entity4 claiming @entity1 shells have hit @entity4 territory			2
but on sunday , a spokesman for @entity37 urged @entity1 to come to the @entity68 conference , which is being billed as a chance to start a reconciliation process in @entity4			2
" we want @entity1 to participate in that			0
we want @entity1 to be part of the solution in @entity4 , " @entity217 said			2
