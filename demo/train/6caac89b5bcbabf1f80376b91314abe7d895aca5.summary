-- a @entity2 group run by a self - described anarchist has posted what appears to be the first video of the live firing of a handgun created with a 3 - d printer			1
the 53 - second video shows a single shot being fired from @entity11 , a plastic handgun that , with the exception of its metal firing pin , was assembled from parts made with a @entity18 printer , according to @entity19			1
the gun appears unscathed after the test firing , although the brief clip does not reveal anything about its range or accuracy			1
the nonprofit group , founded by 25 - year - old law student @entity27 , has posted instructions for the gun online so other people can duplicate it			1
the gun was created with a @entity33 printer , which can be purchased online for as little as $ 8,000			1
@entity27 fired the gun saturday and the video was posted to @entity36 on sunday			1
the group 's self - described " @entity19 " is about a year old			1
until now , the group had only reported being able to make plastic , interchangeable parts for firearms , but not entire weapons			1
the liberator is comprised of 16 interchangeable pieces , with a nail for a firing pin			1
according to the group , the barrel can be changed out to fire different kinds of ammo			2
not surprisingly , reports of the test - firing have reignited calls to ban @entity18 - printed guns , which critics fear could easily fall into the wrong hands and create safety concerns because they 'd be invisible to metal detectors			1
@entity59 sen. @entity58 is one of several politicians pushing for stricter legislation that would ban firearms created with 3 - d printers			2
" passing this law would not only prevent people from making these parts , it would raise awareness on the issue , " @entity58 said sunday during a news conference			0
" we 're facing a situation where anyone -- a felon , a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage			2
" @entity58 is joined by @entity78 congressman @entity77 of @entity59 , who has introduced legislation to renew a ban on plastic guns that is set to expire later this year			2
" i do n't want to make it easier for criminals and terrorists to bring plastic guns through metal detectors and onto airplanes , " he told @entity0 's @entity82 on monday			2
it 's an argument unlikely to sway @entity27 , who has made no secret of his disdain for the @entity78 government in particular and all governments in general			2
( @entity19 makes and sells components with names like " @entity96 " and " the @entity97 , " to tweak politicians who support gun control )			0
" for me , it 's important as a symbolic political statement , " he told @entity0 monday			0
" and that statement is something like , ' no , the future we imagine is one of personalized manufacture and access to objects			0
it does n't matter what the decision is on @entity115 ... in this future , people will be able to make guns for themselves			0
' " that was already true , but now it 's been demonstrated in yet another technology			0
" despite that worldview , @entity19 applied for , and in march received , a federal firearm license which makes it a legal gun manufacturer			0
@entity27 acknowledged in a recent interview with @entity125 that his creation could be used by criminals , but suggested that demonstrating the freedom to create them is more important than trying to stop that from happening			0
" i recognize that this tool might be used to harm people			0
that 's what it is : it 's a gun , " he said			0
" but i do n't think that 's a reason to not put it out there			0
i think that liberty in the end is a better interest			0
" @entity19 is based near @entity144 , @entity2			0
@entity27 has emerged as the face of the group , although many of its members , including the owners of the @entity18 printer the group uses , have chosen to remain anonymous			1
the group 's future plans include expanding the range of ammunition a @entity18 printed gun can fire and making the guns printable with less expensive printers , such as the $ 2,800 replicator 2 by @entity160 .			1
