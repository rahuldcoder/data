-- for his 2010 book " a @entity3 , " artist @entity1 used photos he gathered from @entity5 to give viewers a voyeuristic peek into several of @entity9 's most economically distressed neighborhoods			1
the point was to draw people 's attention to the places we read about in the news — and comment about from the comfort of our own neighborhoods — but never actually visit			2
now , @entity1 is following that work up with a new book called " @entity20 , " where he continues to mine the internet for views of @entity9 that are anything but idyllic			1
this time , he snatches frame grabs from videos that were made on cell phones and uploaded to @entity28			1
what he ended up with is a jumble of violence , exploitation , joy rides , drugs and other illegal activities			0
it is a view of a country struggling with a shifting economic and cultural landscape , one where technology can create or amplify crisis and where cyberbullying , revenge porn and " slut shaming " have gone viral			1
" the range of search terms for the work was huge but largely tied to the broken elements of the @entity9 economic spectrum , " @entity1 said			1
" the search terms really started with simple city names and evolved			2
" i started finding that due to the nature of @entity28 , much of what was posted was predatory in nature and i needed to evolve the work to include that dynamic of the ' predatory act			0
' i determined quickly that ' crackheads ' or ' girls passed out ' or ' hood fight ' were search terms on @entity28 that would bring up massive amounts of content that people were uploading			2
" abusive behavior exploited by technology is not a new story , but @entity1 becomes a predator among the predators , hunting for images to tell this dark @entity9 tale			1
he said he also used keywords such as " police harassment , " " racial profiling " and " gang stalking " to amass his images			0
the book is not a photojournalistic document — the lack of captions and context asks us to create our own narratives			0
the printed text in the book includes a poem created using comments from @entity28			0
and the low resolution of the frame grabs mostly protects the identities of the subjects and gives the visceral imagery an impressionistic gloss			0
@entity1 acknowledged that the images show " elements of social media and technology that are n't pretty , " but he said the series is also about @entity28 as medium and the way it has become " a platform where people have a voice — it is an immediate stage with reach			1
" he said the intimacy of the medium coming right from someone 's hand fascinates him			0
this point of view simply would n't be available to a photographer on the scene			0
" i was the stranger in the car , a fly on the wall , " @entity1 said			2
" they did n't know i was with them that night			0
" he was a silent partner in the flow of data streams that thrive on predatory behavior — both the participants who exploit the vulnerable , and the viewers who encourage them with comments and " likes			2
" " usually the @entity28 posters were looking to get ' hits ' or ' likes ' from the uploads and trying to get laughs , " he said			0
" in many ways , that dynamic was bringing out acts that were incredibly callous , such as paying people on the street to do pushups or cartwheels or showing the writing of the word ' fag ' on the face of a young girl that was passed out			2
i wanted to try and get at this dynamic itself			0
" @entity1 found that the streams that were most voluminous tended to be brutal , as though the technology itself was encouraging impulsive and dangerous behavior			1
he said " @entity20 " is about our habits surrounding modern technology , but that it also comments on race and poverty			1
for poverty - stricken african - americans isolated in deteriorating neighborhoods , the @entity153 may be an impossibility — the " @entity20 " could stand for " not applicable " or perhaps " need not apply			0
" " ' @entity20 ' speaks to an inversion of the @entity153 , an @entity9 facade , an @entity9 illusion , " @entity1 said			1
he said there is " a chasm that has been built like a fortress as relates to opportunity ... a deep division — economic , geographic , cultural , political — in @entity9 that many whites prefer to deny and ignore			1
" @entity1 hopes the book will be a wake - up call on issues of race , economic injustice and technology , saying , " it is this @entity9 that i see in my mind , not the land of the free			1

for his latest book , @entity1 snatches frames from uploaded cell phone videos
he searched for terms related ' to the broken elements of the @entity9 economic spectrum '
much of what he found involved predatory acts , with people being exploited for ' likes '
he said his book is about modern technology as well as race and poverty
