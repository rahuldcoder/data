@entity0 -- the first solo exhibition in about 20 years of early photos of the @entity4 taken by a @entity6 photographer who designed five of their @entity8 album covers is on display in @entity0			1
@entity11 photographed and designed the @entity4 's second to sixth album covers and was the group 's favored snapper for three years between 1963 and 1966 in their early and middle stages of fame			1
@entity11 also traveled with the band on their momentous first tour of @entity20 in 1964 when @entity21 first spread across the @entity22			2
@entity11 , who is now in his 70s and lives near @entity24 in @entity25 , sold his entire @entity4 collection to rock ' n ' roll photo curator and agent @entity27 many years ago			1
the 58 - year - old @entity0 has put up a solo exhibition of @entity11 's work at @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity0			1
" someone gave me @entity11 's number in @entity25 and i contacted him and flew over to see him , " @entity27 says			2
" i was so impressed by his collection of @entity4 photos that i kind of did a deal and gave him some money and bought the entire collection			2
the increasing scarcity of the prints is making them go up in value all the time , " he adds			2
" i did not know when i bought them that they would go up because i was at the beginning of my career -- i had no idea at all , " says @entity27			0
@entity11 made no more than 25 editions of each print and many editions are now almost sold out			2
he is not making any more prints , so for some of the photos on sale , there is just one example left -- signed and numbered by him			2
" he was very close to @entity58 , " @entity27 says , explaining that @entity11 even lived in a flat below @entity58 in @entity0 for one year			1
@entity11 also photographed and designed the covers of @entity58 's first two books , " @entity62 " and " @entity63 " too			1
according to @entity27 , @entity11 described @entity58 as " highly creative , very witty and a very surreal person -- the most interesting of all the @entity4			1
" " but he did say to me once that he found @entity65 the most interesting to photograph as he 's got a large nose and a face with a kind of pathos			0
he always said @entity58 was the best looking , " he adds			0
after graduating from @entity71 in 1959 , @entity11 became a photographer working for the @entity73 and various magazines			2
it was moody black and white pictures he took of @entity77 at the @entity78 in 1963 that impressed @entity4 manager @entity79 that led to his first commission -- to shoot the cover of the @entity4 ' second album , " with the @entity4			1
" it is now one of the most famous sleeves in rock music			0
he proceeded to photograph the next four consecutive @entity4 ' album covers -- " @entity88 , " " @entity89 , " " help ! " and " @entity91 " -- all considered seminal and ahead of their time compared to @entity94 designs at the time			1
some covers , like the music , were modified for the @entity20 market			0
" @entity11 was not the only photographer who took pictures of the @entity4 but he was the only one who worked with them for a continuous period of three years and he was their favorite photographer during that time , " @entity27 says			1
" he toured with them			0
he was obviously a trusted confidante			0
" @entity11 also shot many other rock stars and photographed the first ever @entity105 in 1964 , but according to @entity27 his work with the @entity4 " overshadowed everything else he ever did			1
" ' with the @entity4 ' shot him to fame , " @entity27 says			2
" ' @entity110 ' was a very anodyne shot and was not so easy to recall as the following album			0
" he puts the " with the @entity4 " album cover among the top three @entity4 album cover designs of all time , the others being " @entity117 " and " @entity118			1
" @entity11 also took many other portraits of the boys in different settings capturing their individual personalities and he designed the opening and closing credits of the comedy films " @entity88 " ( 1964 ) and " help ! " ( 1965 ) , both of which starred the rock group			1
but when his proposal for the sixth album , " revolver , " was rejected , he pretty much stopped working with them after that , @entity27 says			0
" i do n't think he was upset -- he felt it was inevitable			0
i do n't think he stayed in touch with the @entity4 after that			0
he continued with his other photography			0
" but he recalls : " @entity11 was living in @entity138 when @entity58 was assassinated in 1980 and he told me that he had a photo of @entity58 on his wall and it fell down at exactly the same time			2
" " what makes the @entity4 unique is that their appeal is not purely nostalgic , " @entity27 explains			0
" @entity145 mean little now to anyone under the age of 30 whereas the @entity4 are probably bigger now than they were at the time			2
when they went over on their first tour to the @entity20 they got what was then the biggest audience in the history of @entity20 tv when they appeared on the @entity157 , " @entity27 adds			0
read about when the @entity4 hit @entity20 @entity158 and @entity20 are his biggest customer market for this collection , which has prints priced from $ 1,500 ( £ 1,000 ) upwards			1

" we 've had all age ranges and people from all round the world coming to see us			0
as soon as the show went up , we found that all the @entity4 and rock ' n ' roll tours of @entity0 were including the gallery on their itineraries			1
we 've had fans alongside serious collectors , " he says			0
" his five covers are so interesting because , putting it simply , they show five completely different ways of portraying four heads in a 12 - inch square			0
" the most expensive print on sale is an ultra large size sepia print of @entity91 , the only one left the world , which is up for sale at $ 45,000 ( £ 30k			1
