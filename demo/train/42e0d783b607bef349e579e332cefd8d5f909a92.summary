@entity0 , @entity1 -- there are few cars in the world where the difference between driving them and watching them being driven is greater than with the trabant			1
it 's a cute little car			1
its two big , round headlights look almost like innocent eyes staring back at the beholder			0
and its tiny frame seems so fragile that all other drivers give you the right of way when you 're taking a spin around town			1
but driving a trabant is an adventure , to say the least			0
as pedestrians smile and take selfies in front of the car , you will be locked in a constant battle just to keep the vehicle on the road			2
slipping behind the wheel of a trabant is sort of like squeezing into a sleeping bag -- especially when you 're 6 feet 5 inches tall , like me			0
getting the engine started is half the battle -- the car immediately stalls if you take your foot off the gas -- and the brakes pretty much do n't work at all			2
take all these factors together and a trip in stop - and - go traffic quickly becomes nerve - wracking torture			0
you 're thrilled when you 've finally reached your destination , and the car can once again become the eye - catching backdrop of a myriad of photos snapped by gawking tourists			2
nevertheless , the @entity52 has been an icon to @entity54 ever since the tiny communist - built cars started rolling across the border between what was then @entity1 in 1989			1
there have been movies about the car , where it is depicted as an underdog in races -- almost like the @entity66 films about " @entity67 " the @entity68			2
the trabant is so significant that @entity70 just had to get one for our coverage of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the @entity75 , and it quickly became one of the centerpieces of our coverage			0
we looked on the internet and found that there are few " @entity81 " left			0
the ones for sale were being offered up not for driving , but for spare parts			0
when we finally found one that had somehow managed to pass its latest driving inspection , we snapped it up immediately			0
the trabant , produced in communist @entity90 by the government - run conglomerate @entity92 from 1957 till 1990 , was flawed from inception			0
a few tweaks were made to the design in 1962 , but fundamentally the car never really changed			2
the @entity99 's frame is made of cheap @entity101 plastic -- a material the @entity54 nicknamed " racing cardboard " -- and its tiny frame houses a 26 horsepower , two - stroke engine that runs on a mixture of oil and gasoline			1
we needed a good concept to make our @entity99 -- a 601 s station wagon -- the corner stone of our " @entity113 " coverage , so we hired the artist @entity114 to give the car a makeover			1
he focused on three themes : @entity0 , @entity2 , and the fall of the @entity75			1
@entity114 did an amazing job			1
he sketched several of @entity0 's most famous symbols on our @entity99 , including the broadcast tower and the @entity124			0
he also drew a tree of people breaching the @entity75 , a symbol of human life penetrating and destroying the anti-human barrier that separated @entity130 and @entity1			1
the longest part of the @entity113 still standing today ( the @entity132 , for instance ) is an open air museum , a living piece of art covered in graffiti			0
thousands of people have scrawled their names on the @entity75 with permanent marker			1
we decided our @entity99 should be no different			0
we asked people from all over the world to sign the car with their names and hometown , and the reaction we got was amazing			1
on november 9 thousands of people crowded around our car to sign it , draw on it , and take their picture with it			1
at some point the authorities asked us to stop because the crowd grew so large that it was blocking the bike path and the street at the @entity132			0
now that the celebrations are over it is time to decide what to do with the @entity160 next			0
it has turned into a real work of art by @entity114 and all those who signed their names on it			1
i certainly will miss our little @entity52 , but i will not miss driving it !			2

@entity2 's @entity170 takes the iconic @entity54 @entity52 car for a spin
the cars rolled across the border between what was then @entity130 and @entity1 in 1989
@entity2 hired the artist @entity114 to give the car a makeover
thousands of people crowded around the car to sign it , draw on it , and take their picture with it
