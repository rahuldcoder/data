-- maybe you thought since @entity2 is playing boy - and - girl twins in " @entity4 " that the movie would be double the fun			1
@entity7 ! on a scale of 1 to 10 on the laugh meter , " @entity4 " is a negative 10			1
a total bust , a stupefyingly unfunny and shamelessly lazy farce packed with cringe - worthy jokes and overt product placement			2
@entity16 ad exec @entity14 ( @entity2 the guy ) is gritting his teeth over a holiday visit from his loudmouthed , overweight twin @entity21 ( @entity2 in drag , showing an unfailing grasp of the obvious )			1
the siblings pick at each other relentlessly between @entity21 's bouts with farting and dropping chimichanga bombs			1
no peace , even with the help of @entity31 's peacemaker wife ( @entity30 looks so trapped in this thankless role you ache to save her )			1

" @entity4 " wants to have its hypocrisy and eat it too			1
look , i 'm not a @entity2 hater			2

" the plot is a stew of half - baked ideas that quickly turns rancid			1
@entity31 has problems at work ; his company will go under if he ca n't persuade @entity68 to play himself in a @entity69 commercial			2
watching the @entity71 winner bust a move and freestyle rap while he extols the virtues of sipping a @entity75 is to witness desperation incarnate			0
@entity2 and director @entity77 must have something on " @entity79 " to make him lower himself to these depths			0
