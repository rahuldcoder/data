prince @entity0 has spoken for the first time about his notorious romp in a @entity4 hotel suite when photographs were published around the world of him nude , just weeks before he began his tour of duty in @entity8			1
the prince was photographed during a game of strip billiards in his hotel suite with friends and a group of women they had met			1
the prince said he had " probably let myself down , i let my family down , i let other people down			1
" " but at the end of the day i was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect			2
" back home all my close friends rallied round me and were great			2
" he added that it was " probably a classic example of me you know probably being too much army and not enough prince			1
it 's a simple case of that			0
" no action over naked prince @entity0 photos , palace says his deployment with @entity38 , @entity39 allowed him to withdraw from the public eye , but speaking while stationed at @entity41 in @entity8 he allowed his frustration with the media to show through			1
@entity0 received news that the @entity46 , was expecting a baby while he was on his tour of duty and , from afar , he expressed sympathy at his sister - in - law 's treatment at the hands of the press			1
" i ca n't wait to be an uncle			0
i think it 's very unfair that they were both forced to publicize it when they were , but that 's just the media for you			1
i just only hope that she and him , but mainly @entity63 , hopefully that she gets the necessary protection to allow her as a mother - to - be to enjoy the privacy that that comes with			0
" @entity0 's own privacy is clearly a concern for the prince as well , and he made little attempt to hide it			1
referring to the tv producer whom he was addressing , he said : " i never wanted you guys to be out here , but there was an agreement made to invite you out on the deal that the media did n't speculate before my deployment			1
that 's the only reason you guys are out here			0
" back home the media glare will inevitably be brighter than it has been on him for the last four months			2
and the pressure will be back on the 28 - year - old to settle down			0
" if you find the right person and everything feels right , then it takes time , especially for myself and my brother			2
you ai n't ever going to find someone who 's going to jump into the position that it would hold			0
" @entity0 said he now put his military role ahead of his royal duties			1
" once you are wearing the uniform you are part of the gang and you know , fine , i am the queen 's grandson and all that good stuff			0
" i love representing her , but to be honest with you ... and as far as i see it ... and as far as @entity109 sees it as well -- our service towards our country in the military in whichever shape or form it takes -- will always come first			2
i know some people look at it thinking it 's all a big bluff -- and the only reason they are doing all this is to keep themselves out of public duties -- well to a certain extent yes			2
there is no reason for us to do public duties , because we are doing public service			0
" @entity0 on @entity8 mission : ' take a life to save a life ' life in the army is " as normal as it 's going to get " for @entity0 and he said relishes having the chance to be hang out and be treated as " one of the guys			1
asked if he was more comfortable being captain @entity137 than @entity0 , he answered : " definitely			1
i 've always been like that			0
my father 's always trying to remind me about who i am and stuff like that			0
" but it 's very easy to forget about who i am when i am in the army			0
everyone 's wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing			0
" @entity0 admitted that he was more at home in an aircraft cockpit than a classroom			1
" i do n't know ... i am one of those people that during my flying course especially ... i would be fine at flying , probably should have done a lot more reading			2
but i was fine at flying			0
then every now and then a written test would come up and i would be absolutely useless ... exams were always a nightmare			0
anything like kicking a ball around and playing @entity165 or flying , i do ... i genuinely find a bit easier than walking sometimes			0
" my brother ( was ) probably exactly the same , my father flew , my uncles have flown all , all sorts of people have flown in my family , i would n't suggest that is where it comes from it is , it 's great fun			1
i was given the opportunity and i could n't say no to it			0
