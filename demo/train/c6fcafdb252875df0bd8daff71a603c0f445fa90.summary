-- the @entity1 is embroiled in a scandal that one of its veteran correspondents has called its worst crisis in nearly 50 years -- over its response to allegations that have turned a beloved on - air personality into one of the most reviled figures in the @entity12			1
since his death a year ago at age 84 , @entity13 , the popular tv host , disc jockey and charity fundraiser has been knocked off his perch as a national treasure , accused of being a predatory pedophile who used his fame and position to abuse youngsters , sometimes on @entity1 premises			1
the corporation has been widely criticized for its handling of the crisis			1
@entity12 police say more than 200 possible victims have now been identified in what one officer commander @entity30 said was " alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale			1
" but who was @entity13 and how did he become the eccentric star -- a cigar - smoking , jewel - encrusted , larger - than - life character who was rewarded with a knighthood for his charitable work ? he mixed with @entity12 high society , and his death was greeted with sadness by many , including @entity45 and his wife , the @entity46			1
he was buried with customary glitz in a gold - colored coffin and with a green beret presented to him by the @entity50 -- but his life began amid much humbler surroundings			0
@entity13 was born in @entity53 in northern @entity54 on @entity55 in 1926 and as a teenager conscripted to work as a coal miner during @entity58 -- these young wartime miners were known as the @entity60			1
he was one of the surviving @entity60 who received an award from the then @entity12 prime minister @entity62 in 2008 for helping to keep the mines operational during the conflict			1
@entity13 suffered serious spinal injuries in a mine explosion and left the colliery but it does n't appear to have stopped him from lifelong participation in sport			1
in the 1950s he took up wrestling and cycling , and he appeared regularly on @entity12 television running in marathons for charity even into his 70s			1
in an interview with the @entity79 newspaper in 2000 he spoke of his love of sport			0
" if you look at the athletics of it , " he told the newspaper , " i 've done over 300 professional bike races , 212 marathons and 107 pro fights			0
" he proudly announced that he lost 35 of his first 35 fights			0
" no wrestler wanted to go back home and say a long - haired disc jockey had put him down			0
so from start to finish i got a good hiding			0
i 've broken every bone in my body			0
" cycling @entity99 reported last year that he also had been a semi-professional cyclist and competed as @entity102 ' @entity101 in the 1951 @entity103 , and supported cycling charities most of his life			2
his broadcast career took off in the early 1960s but he said he had been playing records in dance halls from the mid- 1940s , later claiming that he was the first to use the double - deck turntable , though commentators have pointed out that they were available decades earlier			0
he recalled selling just 12 tickets for his first show but said he enjoyed creating what he referred to as the " atmosphere			2
" " there was this amazing effect : what i was doing was causing 12 people to do something , " he told @entity116 in 2004			0
" my thrill is looking at them , and they 're all doing what they 're doing because i 've just put this thing on			0
it 's a hell of a thing , " he said			0
he joined the independent station @entity130 as a dj in 1958 , but his big break came in 1964 when the @entity1 approached @entity13 to be the first host of " @entity134 " -- a show that became a huge hit for the @entity1			1
it also began a 30 - year tv career that was a showcase for his extravagant dress , yodels and catchphrases like " now then , now then , and " how 's about that then			0
" the @entity1 gave him his own show between 1975 and 1994 in which he helped hundreds of hopefuls , mostly children , fulfill their dreams to meet famous people and take part in stunts			1
" @entity150 'll fix it " aired in the prime teatime slot on a saturday , and at the height of its popularity , the @entity1 said it was receiving 20,000 requests a week			1
famous fixes included an encounter with boxing legend @entity157 and the boy scouts who wanted to eat their packed lunches on a roller coaster , resulting in a predictable mess			0
generations of @entity163 also remember him for a string of public information films including a road safety promotion that encouraged motorists to use their seat belts -- a campaign that started before wearing belts became compulsory in the @entity12			2
@entity13 's closing catchphrase " clunk click every trip " was instantly memorable and caught on with the watching public			1
he also promoted the national rail network in a campaign dubbed " this is the age of the train			0
" @entity13 was knighted in the 1990 @entity178 for " charitable services , " adding to the @entity180 ( @entity180 ) he received in the 1970s , and he set up the @entity13			2
@entity13 was well - known for raising money through charity runs but also worked as a volunteer hospital porter and had a close association with the @entity186 spinal injuries unit			2
@entity188 's @entity187 © , named after the tv personality , has now been changed since the sex abuse scandal surfaced and following specific allegations widely reported in the @entity12 press that one of his alleged victims @entity195 , now 53 , was sexually assaulted by @entity13 in a @entity188 corridor in 1971 , when she was a 13 - year - old patient			1
he told the @entity1 in 2000 that he had raised Â £ 40m ( $ 64 million ) for charity during his lifetime			2
in 1988 @entity13 was appointed to a senior role at @entity200 -- a high security psychiatric hospital in @entity54 that treats some of the most dangerous men in the country -- a role that is now being investigated by the @entity12 's @entity205			1
the department says that in hindsight he should not have been appointed			0
although he was perceived as an odd and eccentric character , the @entity12 public has been shocked by the allegations			2
the @entity13 family had his tombstone removed from his burial site out of " respect to public opinion			2
" @entity216 , author of a series of histories of modern @entity12 , told @entity0 : " because he was associated with the @entity1 , people trusted him and thought of him as a family - friendly face			1
he was a massive presence in the living rooms of millions of @entity12 families			2
" but when @entity13 died , fellow @entity1 disc jockey @entity224 hinted that he was an isolated figure , telling the @entity1 : " he was just a complete one - off			1
i think he was a bit of a lonely character as well			0
in the privacy of his own life i do n't think he had very many friends			0
" film - maker @entity233 perhaps gained more of an insight into what many would regard as odd behavior			0
in a documentary made in 2000 he interviewed @entity239 in a flat where his mother had lived but still kept her clothing hanging in the wardrobe 27 years after her death			0
in the same program he also revealed that he only took a single pair of underpants with him when he went away and washed them in the sink every night			0
despite hosting a children 's show , @entity233 asked him why he hated youngsters and he replied : " we live in a very funny world and it 's easier for me as a single man to say i do n't like children because that puts a lot of salacious tabloid people off the hunt			1
" and when he was confronted about sexual abuse allegations in a 2007 radio interview , he brushed it off with a laugh , saying : " what 's the point of responding to something that 's not true ? " the extensive investigations into @entity13 's behavior are only just beginning , but it appears his reputation as a fun - loving host of pop and a tireless charity worker are already ruined .			1

*flamboyant* @entity276 host , who died in 2011 , accused of being a *prolific* child abuser
@entity101 hosted " @entity134 " and " @entity150 'll fix it , " a @entity1 show mostly for children
@entity12 police say more than 200 possible victims of @entity13 's sexual abuse now identified
@entity1 has been widely criticized for its handling of the @entity288 crisis
