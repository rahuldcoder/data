@entity1 , @entity0 -- sniffer dogs have long been a useful tool in the search for hidden drugs and explosives , but the future looks bleak for man 's best friend as scientists seek to develop a new ultra-sensitive electronic nose device			1
new electronic nose could work just as well as the snouts on man 's best friend , say researchers			1
the electronic nose will be able to identify tiny amounts of explosives in high - traffic , high - risk areas , like airports or shipping terminals , according to researchers			1
@entity25 , a chemical and environmental engineering professor at the @entity26 , and his team are in charge of the project			2
they have just been awarded nearly $ 1 million in grants by the @entity32 to develop the nose , which they claim will work just as well , if not better , than sniffer dog snouts			1
" the sensor we are developing certainly has many possible applications , " @entity25 told @entity2			2
" there are many other scenarios you can imagine			0
" these include using the hand - held device for military operations to detect hazardous materials or even land mines , he said			1
they could also be particularly useful in baggage x-ray machines or placed near passenger metal detectors in screening areas , quickly " breathing " in samples of air as people and luggage pass through			1
and unlike its animal counterpart , the device wo n't get tired , need bathroom breaks or require food and water , @entity25 argues			2
" [ a dog ] takes a lot of training and a person has to be with them all of the time			0
a dog does n't work 7 days a week and maybe will get into a bad mood , " he added			0
they say the device will be able to pick up a smell at extremely low concentrations ranging from parts per billion to parts per trillion and will be able to detect dozens of different odors			1
it will consist of an ultra-thin film made out of zeolite , a porous substance commonly used to refine petroleum			0
the special film will capture certain gas molecules , like those found in the explosive vapors of @entity86			1
the molecules that are trapped on the membrane will interface with an ultra sensitive sensor array made of carbon nanotubes			2
each sensor will generate a specific signal in the presence of different compounds			1
the signals will combine to form a unique pattern , or fingerprint , that will be identified by computer software as a specific scent -- just as a human nose can differentiate between the smell of an apple and an orange , the electronic one will recognize ammonia gas from that of benzene , said @entity25			1
over the past decade , " electronic sensing " or " e-sensing " technologies , that mimic human senses , have grown significantly , especially from a commercial perspective			2
they are used by companies to " smell " everything from beer and wine to spoiled food and medicine			0
the technology behind reproducing human sense will grow even further in coming years			0
researchers at the @entity123 are currently creating a tiny electronic nose made out of a ceramic material that could also detect a range of gases , including hazardous ones like carbon monoxide			1
while scientists at @entity131 in @entity132 are working on a smelling machine that uses strands of dried dna to identity different scents			2
@entity138 has a smelling machine to analyze corn syrup , while scientists at @entity142 have designed one to sniff coffee aromas			2
some cosmetic companies have even used them to smell flower fragrances for their perfumes			0
however , so far no one has developed an electronic snout that can quite compete with the complex and highly sensitive canine olfactory system			1
but former dog handler , @entity153 is not convinced			0
@entity153 , from @entity155 , has a faithful black @entity156 , @entity157 , who worked in drug detection for years			0
for him nothing beats working with man 's best friend			0
" you get attached , " @entity153 told @entity2			0
the most rewarding is you get a dog that literally sometimes has no name , " " the end result is he is happy go out and work because of his loyalty to you			0
each dog has a different personality			0

electronic nose to detect trace amounts of explosive compounds
device to be used in high - risk areas , like airports and shipping terminals
sensory array will recognize specific gases , like those found in @entity86
*e-nose* will equal smelling capabilities of canine nose , say researchers
