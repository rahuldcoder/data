-- women undergoing in - vitro fertilization should have only one or two embryos transferred during the process , depending on their age , says a study published wednesday in the @entity8 medical journal @entity9			1
transferring three or more embryos during any @entity13 cycle should be avoided when possible , researchers say			1
the prospective study analyzed more than 124,000 ivf cycles that ultimately led to the birth of more than 33,000 babies from january 2003 to december 2007			1
the data were obtained via the @entity8 @entity19 , a database of all fertility treatments conducted in the @entity8			0
the study excluded treatment cycles that transferred frozen embryos			1
the researchers divided the women in to two groups : women younger than 40 and those 40 and older			0
the study found that in women 40 and older , transferring more than one embryo resulted in a higher rate of live births			2
however , transferring three or more embryos in a single cycle also led to a higher rate of health complications for both the mother and the baby , in part because the chance of giving birth to twins or triplets was higher			1
these two findings led authors to conclude that women who are 40 and older should have two embryos transferred per @entity13 cycle , while younger women should have only one embryo transferred , and no patients should have more than three embryos transferred at one time			1
" we show that even in older women , we should never have more than three embryos transferred , " says @entity54 , one of the study authors who is a professor of reproductive and maternal medicine at the @entity58			2
" it does n't improve the chances of a woman having a healthy baby			0
" dr. @entity64 is a reproductive endocrinologist and the president of the @entity66 ( @entity66 )			0
he agrees that maximizing the chance of a healthy pregnancy while at the same time limiting the chance for multiple births should be the ultimate goal of reproductive clinicians			0
however he disagrees with the study 's interpretation			2
" there are limitations of the study that concern me significantly in terms of the conclusions that were drawn , " says @entity64			1
in the @entity80 , unlike the @entity8 , transferring three embryos is more of an acceptable practice if certain prognostic indicators are present			2
according to @entity64 , a woman 's age is the most important factor in terms of pregnancy outcome but needs to be looked as a continuous variable			0
he says one major limitation of @entity54 's study is that the women were lumped in to only two groups : those younger than 40 and then the rest , when in reality the chances of a woman getting pregnant can depend on other variables as well			0
" we look at women under the age of 35 , 35 to 37 , 38 to 39 , " and so on , says @entity64			0
he says transferring three embryos is a valid practice if certain factors are in play , including a woman 's age , the number of failed ivf cycles she has already experienced and the quality of her embryo			1
" if you limit the number of embryos you put back inside of a 42 - year - old woman , you reduce her chance of having a child , " because implantation rates are so low for a woman that age , says @entity64			2
conversely , according to the 2009 embryo transfer guidelines published by @entity66 , a 37 - year - old woman could receive three embryos if she had already experienced failed @entity13 attempts or had poor quality embryos			1
so what 's the bottom line for women considering @entity13 ? because @entity13 is an involved , often draining , process , @entity64 says doctors need to determine how many embryos will be transferred on a case by case basis			1
" we ca n't set an absolute limit that applies to every person , " says @entity64			0
" @entity135 are not an ideal outcome and not a desired outcome			0
you really want to adjust the number of embryos ... to not only maximize the chance of achieving a pregnancy but to counter that with a desire to reduce multiple births			0

study published in @entity9 analyzed more than 124,000 in - vitro fertilization cycles
it discourages transferring three or more embryos during any @entity13 cycle
one expert disagrees : " there are limitations of the study that concern me "
