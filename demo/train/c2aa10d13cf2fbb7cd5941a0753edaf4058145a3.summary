@entity0 -- delicate , rare and striking - forgotten photographs of black @entity3 in the late 19th and early 20th century have been unearthed from the depths of the @entity5 -- one of the world 's oldest and largest archives holding over 80 million images			1
@entity12 , a photographic exhibition at @entity14 in @entity0 is currently showcasing over 200 images that explore black presences in @entity17 , the majority of which have never been revealed to the public			1
part of " @entity20 " -- a three - year project devoted to researching and revealing the earliest imagery of black people in @entity3 -- curators renÃ © e @entity25 and @entity26 of archive and research centre @entity28 have re-introduced a neglected part of history to the public consciousness			1
" we have been doing this work around black representation through the prism of photography for 25 years , " says @entity25			1
" what we wanted to do with this research project was to expand , if you like , the narrative back to the very early days - to the invention of photography in 1839			1
" going far back in time the history of black people in @entity3 is most commonly traced back to 1948 , when the " @entity48 " ship carried 492 @entity50 passengers to @entity3 shores , following an ad in a @entity50 newspaper promising affordable carriage on board for those seeking a new life and work in the @entity3			1
searching for images taken prior to this moment proved to be both exciting and overwhelming			1
" we did n't know what we would find in the archive			0
" the @entity5 did n't know what they had because they did n't look at it with this particular remit in mind , and with 80 million records , you can imagine things get lost ! " after extensive rummaging , a wealth of hitherto unknown photographs , carte - de - visites ( thin paper photograph mounted on thick paper card ) , cabinet cards and albumen prints resurfaced			1
a different light among the various treasures found , @entity25 highlights the intriguing case of @entity80 , a young @entity82 boy whose photographs are featured in the exhibit			1
images of @entity80 are easily searchable online and in various publications , but he is often portrayed as servant to sir @entity88 - the infamous writer and explorer of @entity90			2
the images in the exhibition , in contrast , center on @entity80 alone			2
he is not an accessory or an extra part ; he is instead the main focus			0
" @entity80 holds his own in the frame and is dressed in an outfit that any other boy of that era would wear -- not a cloth , not semi-naked			0
visualizing existence the images , however , do more than point to a history that has been overlooked and neglected , they ask the question of who documents our histories and who gets to choose them			2
@entity25 holds that the preference for certain stories and the evasion of others relates to how we prioritize different people 's existence			0
" the most important thing to remember here is that when one is not visualized in history , one does n't exist			0
" so in terms of memory , in terms of contribution and actually being here -- people are often erased ... that means their existence is not acknowledged			0
" these images do occupy a specific time - frame , loosely between the ends of 1830 - 1940s , but the chapter , so to speak , is not over and done with			1
in fact , the aim of the project is to constantly revise and evaluate a neglected era rather than to fill in the holes and then move on			0
" these gaps will always exist and there will always be more " says @entity25			0
wider collaboration much of the project 's excitement is tied to unpredictability , a sense of continuous discovery as new images are unearthed from neglected albums across the globe			2
people are now submitting images from their own personal collections in a bid to help construct a history that has been forgotten -- a welcome by - product of the current showcase at @entity14			1
" someone currently based in @entity164 has sent through about 8 or 9 cabinet card scans of his family here in @entity3 , i think his great - great - grandmother came from @entity50 originally " @entity25 exclaims			0
" there were photographs in the studio which appear to be from the 1860s , judging from the scan			2
" despite the success of the research so far , the current collection dates back only to the 1850s			0
baring in mind photography was invented in the late 1830s , an approximate 10 years ' worth of photos are still left to be uncovered			2
the search for the earliest photograph of a black person in the @entity3 , it seems , is still underway			2
" even if we find it , there is absolutely no certainty that it is the earliest " says @entity25			0
" so far however , the journey to such discovery has proven to be just as important as the discovery itself			0
" all we can do is move close and closer			0
