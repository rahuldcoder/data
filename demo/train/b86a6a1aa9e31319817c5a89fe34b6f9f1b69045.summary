@entity1 attorney general @entity0 announced thursday a @entity3 investigation into the @entity5 , @entity6 , police department , which has come under fire for its past practices in the uproar over the shooting of @entity12			1
@entity0 spoke about his recent trip to the area and about conversations he had with its residents			0
" people consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents , from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the @entity5 police force			1
these anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in @entity5 that has received a good deal of attention , " @entity0 told reporters			0
" our investigation will assess the police department 's use of force , including deadly force			1
it will analyze stops , searches and arrests			1
and it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at @entity5 's city jail , " he said			2
such probes typically focus on paving the way for systemic reform going forward , rather than punishing misconduct from the past , said @entity51 senior legal analyst @entity50			2
nonetheless , they can produce significant changes within a department			0
" it 's very serious , " @entity50 said of the investigation , before it was formally announced , " because it can lead to a virtual federal takeover of the police , as happened recently in @entity61			1
" it is distinct from the @entity3 's previously announced civil rights probe that is specific to the august 9 shooting of @entity12 , an unarmed @entity65 - @entity1 teenager , by @entity5 police officer @entity66 , who is white			1
proving a civil rights violation would require showing that @entity66 was actively hostile to @entity12 because of his race			1
the shooting and the fact authorities did n't immediately , and still have n't , charged @entity66 spurred emotional and , at times , violent protests on the streets of @entity5			0
dozens were arrested over those tense few weeks , which were sometimes marred by looting and clashes between protesters and law enforcement			0
@entity12 's shooting also stirred up locals ' gripes about @entity5 police over the years			1
some of them said members of the predominantly white police force would routinely and inordinately single out african - americans , who make up two - thirds of the @entity91 suburb 's population			1
residents : police have ' a power trip problem ' many african - americans said that they often found themselves subject to racial profiling -- such as being pulled over for no obvious reason besides , they presumed , " @entity98 , " or driving while black			0
some white residents complained police have acted in a heavy - handed fashion			0
chief @entity102 has said the claim that officers are more likely to stop blacks is more perception than reality			0
other cases , though , went well beyond that			0
the family of @entity111 recently filed a lawsuit accusing police of excessive force , saying he died of cardiac arrest on september 17 , 2011 , after police fired tasers at him			1
the family says that @entity111 , who they say suffered a psychological disorder , was walking around naked and posed no threat to police			0
it 's not clear which cases , specifically , the new federal investigation will examine			2
the probe will not focus on law enforcement 's response to @entity12 - related protests , since that effort involved numerous agencies and @entity5 did not lead this multi-agency effort			1
$ 40 million lawsuit slams police actions during protests @entity5 is be the latest of many local police and sheriff departments nationwide to be subject to such a federal investigation , which @entity50 explains are launched " when there are persistent allegations of misconduct			2
" this april , for instance , the @entity3 lambasted police in @entity145 , @entity146 , for what it characterized as a longstanding history of police brutality and unnecessary deadly force , sometimes " in an unconstitutional manner			2
" the report laid out several measures to address the problems , such as changing policies , training procedures and recruitment protocol			0
report : @entity145 police have ' pattern ' of excessive , deadly force police departments in @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and elsewhere have agreed to @entity3 plans to address controversial policies and patterns of alleged misconduct			2
but nowhere has the federal agency come down harder than on the @entity61 police department , which has been plagued for years by allegations of corruption , excessive use of force , illegal searches and widespread racial discrimination			1
in july 2012 , @entity0 detailed a consent decree -- which he called the most wide - ranging such agreement in @entity1 history -- that includes more than 100 recommendations dealing with virtually every aspect of the department			0
feds , @entity61 police agree on overhaul			0

@entity189 will look at the department 's use of force
it will also assess stops , searches and arrests
analyst : @entity200 is " very serious , " can lead to " virtual federal takeover " of police
it is distinct from another federal probe that 's specific to @entity12 's shooting
