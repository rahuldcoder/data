-- his name is @entity3			0
he 's just seven months old and is attracting attention to the murky world of surrogacy in @entity7 , as the military - led country cracks down on the industry			1
@entity3 was born with @entity10 in december last year to an impoverished @entity7 mother , @entity11 ; one of twins she was carrying for an @entity14 couple			1
however , when it came time to take the babies home , they only took one -- a healthy girl -- leaving the ailing boy in @entity7 with a mother ill - equipped to care for a child with special needs			1
she said the couple told her they were " too old " to take care of twins , according to @entity28			1
however , on monday , the @entity29 reported the father claimed doctors had only told the couple about the baby girl			1
" when the girl was discharged from the hospital , the mother asked me that if i would be able to raise the boy			1
how come they said that they did n't know about it ? i do n't understand , it sounds like they are lying , " @entity11 told @entity0			1
she said the couple did n't show any interest in taking the boy home			1
" ( they ) never even looked at the boy			0
even milk , they never bought for him			0
the boy was sleeping next to the girl 's bed , diapers were run out , they never bought ones for him , " she said			0
' i was told to get rid of the baby ' @entity11 spoke to @entity0 from a @entity7 hospital where baby @entity3 is receiving treatment for pneumonia			1
she 's just 21 , has two children of her own , aged six and three , and works selling snacks at a food stall			2
" i was told the baby has @entity10 ( syndrome ) when i was seven months pregnant , " she said			1
" i was told to get rid of the baby and there would be some ways to save the other child			1
i refused because it is a sin			0
" @entity11 says she met the intending parents just three times , and claims the agency who put them in touch has n't paid her the full 300,000 baht fee ( $ 9,300 )			2
an online crowd - funding campaign to raise money for his care has raised more than $ 215,000 in just 12 days			1
along with @entity10 -- a genetic disorder that impairs growth and intellectual ability -- @entity3 has a heart condition that may require surgery			2
" i feel so happy , because we are poor we ca n't afford to pay all medical bills for the child , " @entity11 said			2
fund - raising has now been taken over by @entity92 , an @entity14 - based charity that works with orphans and needy children in @entity7			1
" the original money was for the projected costs associated with the heart surgery -- what we 'll now be able to do is to plan for the longer term needs , through to his schooling , " the charity 's founder @entity96 told @entity0			2
risks of going abroad @entity107 knows the challenges of having to go abroad for a much - wanted child			2
he and his partner spent years navigating the @entity112 surrogacy system before the birth of baby girls in 2011			0
he says the claim the parents did n't know about the boy was hard to believe			0
" most or nearly all intending parents look forward anxiously every month to scans from their surrogates showing their growing babies			0
the agency would send the scans over on a regular basis			0
there 's no reason why this agency would not have done that , " he said			0
@entity107 is the director of @entity129 , an organization that helps to guide intending parents through the process			0
" the vast majority of cases bring happiness and joy to both parties			0
but it does show the need , particularly in @entity7 , for more oversights and regulations and we welcome the fact that the @entity7 government has said they 're going to be clamping down , " he said			2
worried parents while @entity3 's case has caused an outpouring of sympathy for the boy and his mother -- and anger against his would - be parents -- it 's also highlighted the fears of dozens of other couples waiting for children of their own			1
on july 22 , @entity7 authorities announced they were tightening restrictions on the industry			2
in the last few days , officials have stopped a number of babies born through surrogacy from leaving the country , @entity107 said			0
" there 's a huge concern about that			0
in @entity14 alone we have 80 to 90 families with pregnant surrogates in @entity7 , which are very concerned about their access to their children			1
" we 're looking for clarity from the @entity7 government as soon as possible about the safe passage of those babies , " he said			2
while @entity3 's case was n't the catalyst for the crackdown , families through @entity178 said the abandonment of disabled children by foreigners was one of the issues identified by @entity7 authorities			1
not the first " from within the surrogacy community i 've heard that this has happened before , " said @entity187 , a researcher from @entity188 who has been gathering stories about people 's experiences with surrogacy abroad			0
" whenever we have a case like this , it highlights the fact that we need international regulation of commercial surrogacy , " she said			0
" if there was more counseling , and the intending parents and gestational carrier were able to talk that through beforehand , it would n't come up in this situation -- it 's such a sad outcome			0
