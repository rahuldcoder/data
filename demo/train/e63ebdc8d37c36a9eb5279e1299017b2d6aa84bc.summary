-- a wrongful death lawsuit filed in the aftermath of a july boat accident questions the safety of amphibious tour vessels , but the so - called duck boats ' record indicates just two fatal accidents in more than 50 years of service			1
on july 7 , a 250 - foot sludge barge pushed by a tugboat overran a disabled 33 - foot @entity13 tour boat , plunging the amphibious vessel with its 35 passengers and two crew members under the surface of the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			1
two student tourists from @entity22 , @entity23 , 16 , and @entity24 , 20 , drowned			2
ten other passengers suffered minor injuries , according to a @entity28 initial report released september 10			1
ride the @entity13 has suspended its @entity19 operation since the accident , but company president @entity31 said he expected tours to resume soon			1
the company is working out details with the @entity36 and the city			2
in a statement released to the media , @entity31 pointed to the tugboat 's failure to heed repeated radio calls alerting it to the disabled vessel in its path			0
a lawsuit filed on behalf of the students ' parents claims , among other things , that duck boats are inherently unsafe			2
" there is no doubt that @entity23 and @entity56 , on their first trip to @entity55 , thought they were safe when they boarded the duck boat			0
they had no idea they were on an accident waiting to happen , " said @entity60 , one of the attorneys who filed the suit			0
but officials with the @entity36 and @entity13 say the vessels have an excellent safety record			1
" thirty - three years we 've been in this business , @entity13 , and we 've never had so much as a wet shoelace before this tragedy , " @entity31 told @entity0			2
since starting operations in @entity19 in 2003 , ride the @entity13 has safely transported more than 1 million passengers on more than 42,000 tours in the @entity20 city , a company statement said			1
ride the @entity13 is a subsidiary of @entity78 of @entity79 , @entity80			0
the company owns ride the @entity13 operations in six locations , as well as the @entity85 theme park in @entity86 , @entity87 in @entity80 , and other attractions			0
the original duck boat , with a standard @entity91 six - wheel truck frame and a propeller , was designed to ferry troops and materiel from warships to land during @entity96 @entity97 built 21,000 of the vessels , officially called @entity99 , between 1942 and 1945 , when production ceased			0
most were scrapped after the war , but entrepreneurs converted a few dozen for jolly excursions across land and water for tourists			0
@entity31 's 90 or so boats are latter - day replicas , manufactured at a @entity111 , @entity112 , shop and designed to look like the @entity96 workhorses			0
today , 128 duck - style boats have certificates to remain in service with several companies , according to the @entity36			1
only one other fatal accident involving a dukw has been documented			2
in 1999 , the @entity119 -- owned by a now - defunct company -- sank in @entity121 near @entity122 , @entity123 ; 13 passengers drowned			1
the @entity28 investigated the accident and recommended several changes to ducks ' design and operation standards , but the @entity36 did not concur			1
read the @entity28 's preliminary report on the accident citing " an unacceptable level of risk to passenger safety , " the @entity28 recommended in may 2002 that duck operators and refurbishers " provide reserve buoyancy through passive means , " such as installing watertight compartments or buoyant foam in the hull			1
modern boats include such features			0
the @entity28 also found that several of the @entity119 victims were trapped under the vessel 's canopy as it rapidly sank and recommended that duck canopies be removed or modified to come off easily in an emergency			1
in a september 2002 response , the @entity36 said existing regulations and standards , if followed , were sufficient to ensure passenger safety			1
" when you follow the navigation rules , usually everything goes fine , " capt. @entity153 , chief of the @entity154 at @entity36 headquarters in @entity156 , told @entity0 recently			2
" @entity160 does n't certificate inherently unsafe vessels , " he said			0
@entity162 , an attorney representing the @entity19 victims ' families , says that 's not a good answer			2
" if they had canopies that were retractable and foldable -- like we 've had on convertible cars for about 100 years -- they would n't have that problem " of trapping passengers underwater , he said			2
@entity36 regulations do not require duck passengers to wear personal flotation devices ( @entity177 ) , which puts them in danger of drowning , @entity162 said			1
but the devices could pin their wearers against the vessel 's canopy , which is what happened to several victims in the @entity123 accident , according to the @entity28			1
" if you keep the canopy on , then you 're damned if you do and damned if you do n't , " said @entity162 , who characterizes the canopies as " death cages			0
" " if you put your @entity177 on , it 's harder to get out			0
if you do n't put your @entity177 on , you 're more likely to drown			0
passengers on a sightseeing cruise should never be faced with that life - or - death decision			0
" the preliminary @entity28 report on the @entity19 accident did not indicate whether passengers were wearing @entity199 , but eyewitness accounts and images from the scene showed some were and some were n't when they were rescued			1
ride the @entity13 ' @entity31 says the circumstances of the 1999 @entity123 disaster and this summer 's accident in @entity19 were completely different , but his company 's focus is always on safety			1
" none of us are ok with this , and none of us want to ever go through it again , " he said			0
the lawsuit is not likely to come to trial in the @entity217 for two to three years , @entity162 said .			0

@entity28 warned in 2002 that canopies on excursion vessels could trap passengers
records show only two fatal accidents involving amphibious tour boats
