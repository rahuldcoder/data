@entity0 -- communication on @entity3 started with the simple , emotionally vague " poke			1
" over the past eight years , many features have been added to the social network , multiplying the ways people can interact with each other			0
you can chat and message someone , tag them in a photo or a post , check them into a location , post on their timeline or mention them in your own posts			2
a negative side effect of all these exchanges is that the potential for miscommunications and conflicts has also boomed , ranging from an adult not liking how they look in a tagged photo to cyberbullying among teenagers			1
to make it easier to catch and resolve volatile situations early on , @entity3 is changing how content is reported , the company announced wednesday			1
it 's giving users tools to better communicate their feelings and handle conflicts themselves			1
the changes are the result of collaborations with @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 that involved months of research and focus groups with kids , teachers and clinical psychologists			1
the first change is specifically for 13 - and 14 - year - olds ( you have to be at least 13 to sign up for a @entity3 account )			1
if a boy in that age range wants to report a mean or threatening post or image a schoolmate has put on @entity3 , he can click " this post is a problem " ( a new phrase chosen to replace the stiff " report " ) and go through a series of casually worded questions to determine what kind of issue he 's having and how serious it is			1
there 's even a grid for ranking his emotions			0
once he finishes the questions , a list of suggested actions is generated based on how pressing his complaint is			0
if the boy is more annoyed than than fearful , he might choose to send a pre-written message to the other person saying that the post makes him uncomfortable			2
if he is afraid , he will be prompted to get help from a trusted friend or adult			0
there are links to catch anyone who may be feeling suicidal and direct them to professionals and @entity3 's own suicide chat hotline			1
" we feel it is important that @entity96 provide encouragement for kids to seek out their own support network , " said @entity92 , a psychoanalyst from @entity46 who worked on the project			1
" the children tell us they are spending hours online ... they are living their lives with @entity3 on in the background			1
" kids are n't the only ones who need a little help communicating their feelings on the @entity107			0
@entity3 looked at photos that are reported for removal by all ages , flagged for offenses like being pornographic , containing hate speech or depicting drug use			2
when they started to dig in , the team noticed images were frequently being flagged for more personal reasons -- someone did n't like how they looked in the photo , was embarrassed their boss could see them dancing on a table or maybe was just trying to wipe away evidence of an old romance			0
usually when a photo is reported for violating community standards , it goes to a @entity3 employee who has to determine what steps to take			1
that adds up a lot of requests			0
by expanding the options and directing people to ask the person who posted a photo to take it down , @entity3 is putting its members in charge of their own issues and saving itself some resources as a bonus			1
" how do you build in emotion , this ancient part of human nature , in to the @entity3 site ? " asked @entity140 , director of the @entity141 at @entity47			2
@entity140 's team worked with @entity3 to add some feeling to the process , customizing the stock requests based on the reason for wanting the photo removed and how important it was to the offended party that it come down			1
the wording was made more polite and the recipient given pre-writen answers to choose from too , opening up a dialog between the two sides			0
the changes are n't the most major @entity3 has made , or even the most noticeable tweaks to roll out this week			2
but the shifts show the company is paying careful attention to the nuanced ways people communicate emotions on the social network			0
and by researching , changing wording and tracking response rates , it is also figuring out how to better engage its users			0
the motive was good , conflict resolution and helping kids , but the method could also have handy applications for delivering paid content			0
" language really matters and design really matters for this stuff , " said @entity179 , a @entity3 product manager			2
" the smallest change can have a really notable impact			0
" the changes have been available to many @entity3 users as part of a test period and are rolling out to all @entity190 members this week			1
early statistics are promising : the rate of people completing the questionnaire when untagging an image has jumped from 48 % to 78 %			0
the team hopes to expand the program to other languages and countries but only after carefully recalibrating the wording for those cultures			0
the results of the studies were presented wednesday ( which was @entity204 ) in @entity205 , @entity206			0
the company 's anti-cyberbullying push was started shortly after the @entity210 suicide , though @entity3 says it was n't inspired by a single event .			2

@entity3 adds tools to help adolescents deal with cyberbullying
changes are the result of research done with @entity45 and @entity46 *universities*
instead of reporting a photo , users are pushed to ask the person who posted it to take it down
