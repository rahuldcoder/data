-- got a smartphone ? never lose your hotel key , or even have to stop at the registration desk , again			2
that 's the vision of a hotel chain that plans to send digital keys to guests ' phones via an app instead of making them check in and get the traditional ( and famously lose - able ) plastic swipe cards			1
arriving guests could bypass the front desk and go straight to their rooms			1
@entity16 , which owns more than 1,150 hotels in nearly 100 countries , plans to debut the system in the next three months at two of its @entity22 hotels -- in the @entity24 neighborhood of @entity25 and @entity26 , @entity27			1
@entity26 is likely no accident -- being , of course , the home of @entity32 's headquarters			0
if all goes well , the company says it could have the feature in all of its hotels by next year			0
a spokeswoman said the app will initially be compatible with recent @entity40 models ( @entity41 and newer ) and newer @entity43 phones			0
the app will use bluetooth technology to unlock the room with a tap			2
" we believe this will become the new standard for how people will want to enter a hotel , " @entity47 , @entity16 's ceo , told @entity48			0
" it may be a novelty at first , but we think it will become table stakes for managing a hotel			0
" @entity16 , a chain that 's heavy on boutique hotels , has a history of tech innovation and employs its own digital team			1
just last year , the company launched a plan to develop solar power at its hotels , offered discounts during a " cyber monday " sale and premiered an @entity70 - specific mobile app. @entity16 also announced @entity72 integration on its websites , which lets visitors see images that guests have posted .			2
