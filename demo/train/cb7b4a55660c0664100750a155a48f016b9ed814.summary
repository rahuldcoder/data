-- in 1980 , in the pre-internet , pre-download days when @entity2 formed in @entity3 , @entity4 , there was no alternative			1
if you listened to pop music , there were essentially three divisions : top 40 of the type you heard on the rapidly fading @entity26 , the corporate rock of album - oriented @entity16 and what was then called college radio -- a catch - all for the punk , new wave , electronic , low - fi and oddball music that almost never crossed over to the mainstream			1
@entity2 helped to change all that			1
they were n't the only ones -- the @entity31 art - punks of the late ' 70s , notably @entity32 and @entity33 , had hit the @entity34 , and fellow @entity3 scenesters the @entity35 had established a national following with their party - down rave - ups			1
but it was @entity2 that , in the words of @entity44 's @entity43 , " transformed the @entity41 underground			1
" if , in the ' 60s , teenagers gathered in their parents ' garages in the hopes of being the next @entity49 , in the ' 80s young adults knocked around dormitories in hopes of being the next @entity2 : melodic , guitar - based and determined not to sell out to the corporate - music crowd			1
@entity2 was the great hope of fame - fantasizing , used - record - store clerks everywhere			1
" they did this grass - roots thing that nobody had ever done , " said @entity58 , a former member of the band @entity59 , which toured with @entity2 in the mid- ' 80s			1
" they sort of bypassed big marketing , and were at the clubs networking with the cool fellow record - store people			1
" in @entity2 's wake came a breadth of artists who turned college radio into a home for guitar - based rock and power - pop : the @entity70 , @entity75 and the @entity76 , among many others			1
years later , @entity78 emerged and the whole world broke open			2
@entity81 , in fact , was a big @entity2 fan			1
now @entity2 has come to an end			1
" to our fans and friends : as @entity2 , and as lifelong friends and co-conspirators , we have decided to call it a day as a band , " read a message posted on the group 's website wednesday			1
" we walk away with a great sense of gratitude , of finality , and of astonishment at all we have accomplished			2
to anyone who ever felt touched by our music , our deepest thanks for listening			2
" the band did n't easily fit labels			2
its early sound , led by @entity103 's ringing guitar arpeggios , might best be described as folk - rock , equal parts @entity106 - ian harmony and punk snarl			1
@entity109 was lead singer @entity111 's reedy vocals and , more distinctively , his resonant , nonsensical lyrics , full of phrases such as " cages under cage " and " hear the howl of the rope			1
" ( @entity118 , a popular music - geek parlor game involved deciphering @entity2 lyrics			1
) and underneath @entity103 and @entity111 was the rock - solid rhythm section of bassist @entity122 and drummer @entity123 , filling spaces with melodic bass lines and powerhouse percussion			1
@entity2 may have had its artsy flourishes , but the band also -- in " @entity129 " parlance -- " had a good beat you could dance to			1
" the band formed at a time when " underground " really meant something , said @entity58 , now of @entity137			1
" you could n't trade ( music ) on the @entity139			0
you had to know somebody or you had to go the club , " she said			0
" and that 's the other reason a band like that was able to thrive -- people went to see live music			0
" and they had such a cool vibe in person			0
they were smart , they were funny , they were charismatic			0
all of that played into it			0
" moreover , the band worked hard , providing a model for others to follow			0
in the ' 80s , starting with the 1982 ep " @entity161 , " there was a new record almost every year , each one followed by a never - ending tour of theaters and clubs			2
" nobody wanted to play the kinds of bars we played , " @entity123 recalled in " @entity173 , " @entity167 's chronicle of the @entity3 music scene			1
" just by being an out - of - town band that played this new kind of music , we were stars			2
" they had a personal connection with their fans ; after all , @entity103 was a record - store clerk once , too , and had a deep appreciation of music history			2
decades on , they have maintained their ties to @entity3			1
their management office is still in town			0
with each album the band 's sound grew deeper and wider , developing the basics on " @entity192 " -- @entity194 's 1983 album of the year -- and " reckoning , " exploring folk on " @entity197 , " and getting back to their roots in 1986 's " @entity199			2
" @entity2 finally broke through to mainstream success with 1987 's " document , " which contained the band 's first top 10 hit , " @entity206 , " as well as the radio favorite " it 's the @entity205 )			1
" " document " changed things , for the band and its audience			0
with its success came a major - label deal with @entity213 and a change in venue from theaters to arenas			2
" it 's weird being a media figure , to be recognized everywhere by somebody , " @entity111 told @entity194 in 1992			0
the members of @entity2 always seemed aware of their status and took pains to remain true to their muse			1
" that would be my worst fear , that we would turn into one of those dumb bands who go into their second decade and do n't know how bad they are and do n't know when to give it up , " @entity111 told @entity194			2
despite the concerns of many fans -- who , as a 2003 @entity233 article observed , have been claiming the band 's decline since 1984 -- the early - ' 90s albums included some of @entity2 's best work			1
" @entity239 " ( 1991 ) featured one of the band 's best songs , " @entity248 " ; famed indie dj @entity243 was so taken with the song that he played it repeatedly during one radio show			0
perhaps the best of the run -- and , to some , the band 's best album , period -- was 1992 's elegiac " @entity254 , " which hit all the right notes : somber ( " drive " ) , humorous ( " @entity257 " ) , angry ( " @entity258 " ) and hopeful ( " @entity259 " )			0
the band even managed to work in the f - word in " @entity254 , " their knockoff of 10cc 's " @entity263			2
" but the rest of the ' 90s proved difficult			0
with the million - selling albums and gigantic tours , they risked becoming what fans had feared : a corporate behemoth			1
more dramatically , drummer @entity123 suffered a life - threatening brain aneurysm while on tour in 1995			2
he left the group in 1997 , becoming a gentleman farmer in @entity277 , @entity4 , south of @entity3			1
the band continued , but it was n't the same			0
the albums , such as " @entity281 " ( 1998 ) and " reveal " ( 2001 ) , were a mixed bag			0
" not as bad as it first sounds , but also not as good as they thought when they released it , " critic @entity283 said of " reveal			0
" they toured , on and off			0
@entity103 hung out with pal @entity291 's band , the @entity290			0
hopes were raised with the band 's most recent release , " @entity296			0
" " song for song , the best thing we 've ever done , " @entity103 told @entity194 earlier this year			2
" we surprised ourselves with this record			0
we 're all really thrilled with it , " said @entity111 in a june @entity0 interview			0
but the album was also the end of something -- the final record in their current @entity213 deal			0
it was time for the circle to close			0
" we realized that these songs seemed to draw a natural line under the last 31 years of our working together , " @entity111 told @entity0			0
" you can talk to any band			0
they owe a debt to them , somehow , " @entity58 said			0
after all , as the band sang in " @entity323 , " " not everyone can carry the weight of the world			0

@entity2 helped lead the way for generation of @entity41 bands
group was formed in 1980 in @entity3 , @entity4
" they did this grass - roots thing that nobody had ever done , " says fellow musician
group stayed true to muse , even after becoming million sellers
