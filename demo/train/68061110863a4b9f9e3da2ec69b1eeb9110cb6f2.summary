-- of all the terrible conflicts facing the world in 2013 , @entity1 is undoubtedly the most complex and dangerous			1
violence has left four million people inside @entity1 in desperate need of help -- shelter , food , education , clean water , health care and protection -- and has uprooted two million inside the country and sent 600,000 fleeing the horrors of war into neighboring countries			1
now a bitter winter is the new enemy			2
@entity1 's children suffer the most			1
at least half of all those affected by the conflict are children			1
too many have been injured or killed ; too many have seen family and friends die , their homes and schools reduced to rubble			2
the good news is our aid is reaching approximately 1.5 million @entity1 , even in areas of fighting -- children are being vaccinated , and temporary schools are being set up , families are being fed and sheltered -- thanks to our work and to the valiant , efforts of many partners like the @entity43			1
but we could do so much more			2
there are areas inside @entity1 where our ability to deliver is intermittent at best ; where we can not reach those in need of our help			1
we appeal to all the parties involved in the conflict to grant unrestricted humanitarian access inside @entity1			1
sadly , if this appeal continues to go unheeded , we fear the already horrific level of suffering will become even worse			2
crisis in @entity1 : the refugees with each passing day , and each passing week it becomes harder for @entity1 to endure			1
most can not flee and find safe havens in neighboring countries			1
some find precarious refuge with friends or the kindness of strangers in another town			2
others shelter in abandoned , unheated buildings or makeshift camps			0
many find themselves moving from one place to another , again and again as the conflict spreads			0
living conditions in all areas of the country are deteriorating rapidly			1
it is not only the violence that people fear , but the combined threat of hunger , cold and illness			2
neighboring countries have opened their borders to 600,000 @entity1 refugees and , with the help of humanitarian organizations like ours , offer basic support for their survival			1
but even they face difficult challenges			0
most refugees are children who have escaped with mothers and grandmothers			0
now , many have been refugees for 21 months			0
it has been @entity99 's job to register them and provide them with shelter and basic relief items like mattresses , blankets and kitchen sets			0
what 's next for @entity1 in 2013 ? in most places , @entity107 vouchers allow them to buy fresh food from the market			1
@entity111 helps children overcome their trauma , gets them into schools , and gives them with books and supplies and access to better health			0
host communities open their homes and their hearts			0
host governments provide medical and other community services			0
as the numbers of refugees grow , so does the strain on these host governments			0
the resources provided by @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 are dangerously stretched			0
no one can predict how long this will last			0
what is needed now is support from the entire international community to asylum countries and organizations like ours to help us do more			2
in december , the @entity141 appealed for $ 1.5 billion for the humanitarian response both inside and outside @entity1 and we are urging donors to contribute more			1
if the conflict ca n't be stopped now , the least we can do is ease the suffering			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 .			0

@entity141 agencies say they struggle to get aid to some areas inside @entity1
