the staffing search for a @entity2 campaign manager is heating up , and a @entity4 spokesman acknowledged thursday that the former secretary of state is " casting a wide net " when talking to different people about about a would - be presidential bid			1
@entity4 met with @entity9 , the outgoing head of the @entity10 , on wednesday in @entity11 , according to @entity12 , and has talked with @entity13 , a former @entity4 aide , about 2016.â € ‹ both are seen as frontrunner for the top job in a @entity4 campaign			1
although @entity4 's spokesman said he would n't confirm or deny the meeting and conversations occurred , @entity18 acknowledged that @entity4 is talking with a wide array of people about 2016			2
" as she decides , she 's casting a wide net and wants to hear from a variety of people on a range of specific topics , from policy ideas to what a successful campaign would look like , " @entity18 said in an email			2
@entity34 have repeatedly said that @entity4 has yet to make up her mind , but according to people close to @entity4 , there have long been four names in the campaign manager race : @entity9 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
here is what you need to know about each			0
@entity9 : although @entity9 , as executive director of the @entity10 , was at the helm when @entity34 lost the @entity50 in 2014 , he is close with the @entity51 -- particularly @entity4 -- and worked as @entity2 's national political and field director in 2008			1
@entity9 is an unpretentious figure and has won the trust of many on @entity56			0
earlier in his career he led the standard journeyman campaign life , working for campaigns in @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 ( where he led sen. @entity65 's dark - horse win in 2010 )			0
@entity9 has been hesitant to talk about @entity4 publicly as she considers a 2016 run and did not respond to an email for this story			2
@entity70 : the then 33 - year - old political operative was seen as a man on the rise when he steered gov. @entity74 to victory in @entity76 in 2013 and is regularly mentioned by people close to @entity4 as a smart choice for campaign manager			1
before working for @entity74 , @entity13 was the head of the @entity81 and in 2008 steered the @entity4 presidential campaign to wins in @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			2
@entity13 , who has a loyal following in his own @entity10 circle , started his political career working for then gov. @entity90 in @entity91			0
like @entity9 , @entity13 has been hesitant to comment publicly on @entity4 's 2016 bid			1
he did , however , make the most interesting splash of any of the possible campaign managers when emails he sent to a group of supporters were leaked to @entity99			0
in the emails , which were sent to a group called the " @entity103 , " the operative urged his supporters to " smite @entity106 mafia - style			0
" @entity42 : @entity42 currently has what she calls " one of the very best jobs in @entity113 politics right now " and it would n't be a stretch to say @entity2 probably agrees			1
as head of @entity116 , @entity42 's goal is to help elect pro-choice , @entity10 women across the country -- something @entity4 regularly talks about on the stump			0
@entity42 , the often - on - message campaign veteran , started her career as @entity90 's 2004 finance director , where she tapped into a new revenue stream -- the internet -- to raise money			1
she then went on to lead high profile @entity50 campaigns , including @entity129 's in @entity130 and @entity131 's in @entity132 , to wins			0
@entity42 briefed the press at last month 's @entity136 strategy session , where she flatly said she was " not going to talk about " a possible role in the @entity4 campaign			2
" i am not going to talk about any conversation i may or may not be having with any candidate who may or may not be running for office , " she said			0
@entity43 : @entity43 , a @entity142 based consultant with deep ties to the @entity4 , would be the dark horse in this field of four			0
while @entity43 led @entity2 's campaign to 2008 wins in @entity142 , @entity149 and @entity61 , it is the list of other democrats he has worked for that is impressive : @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity90 , to name a few			1
people close to @entity4 say that @entity43 would be a good , outside - the - beltway choice for campaign manager			1
although he had deep ties to @entity11 -- through the people he has worked for -- @entity43 is based in @entity142 and has focused on the state in the last few years			2
and it seems like @entity43 is interested			0
" anything @entity2 asks me to do , i will do , " @entity43 told the @entity165 in november			1
" i 'm a huge charter member of the @entity2 fan club			0

@entity2 is *reportedly* meeting with candidates to be her 2016 campaign manager
