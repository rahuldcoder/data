there 's no way for us to know exactly what happened some 13.8 billion years ago , when our universe burst onto the scene			2
but scientists announced monday a breakthrough in understanding how our world as we know it came to be			0
if the discovery holds up to scrutiny , it 's evidence of how the universe rapidly expanded less than a trillionth of a second after the @entity15			1
" it teaches us something crucial about how our universe began , " said @entity16 , a physicist at @entity17 , who was not involved in the study			2
" it 's an amazing achievement that we humans , doing science systematically for just a few hundred years , can extend our understanding that far			0
" what 's more , researchers discovered direct evidence for the first time of what @entity30 predicted in his general theory of relativity : gravitational waves			1
these are essentially ripples in space - time , which have been thought of as the " first tremors of the @entity15 , " according to the @entity37			0
a telescope at the @entity39 called @entity40 -- @entity41 2 -- was critical to the discovery			1
the telescope allowed scientists to analyze the polarization of light left over from the early universe , leading to monday 's landmark announcement			1
how inflation works scientists use the word " inflation " to describe how the universe rapidly expanded after the @entity15 in a ripping - apart of space			1
the @entity40 results are the " smoking gun for inflation , " @entity54 , professor of physics and astronomy , said at a news conference			1
@entity54 also was not involved in the project			0
" inflation is the theory about the ' bang ' of @entity15 , " said @entity62 , an assistant professor of physics at @entity64 and @entity65 , and a co-leader of the @entity40 collaboration , in a @entity64 video			1
" it explains why we have all this stuff in the universe			2
" imagine that you are making a raisin bun , said @entity64 physicist @entity78 , who worked on sensors and readout systems used in the experiment			0
as the dough bakes and expands , the distance from any given raisin to another increases			0
" certainly everything in the universe that we see now , at one time before inflation , was smaller than an electron , " @entity78 said			1
" and then it expanded during inflation at faster than the speed of light			1
" you may have learned in physics class that light sets the universe 's speed limit , but space - time is an exception ; it can stretch faster than the speed of light , @entity78 said			1
@entity64 professor @entity102 , who helped develop the current inflation theory , said the new results are something he had hoped to see for 30 years			1
" if this is true , this is a moment of understanding of nature of such a magnitude that it just overwhelms and let 's just hope that it 's not a trick , " @entity102 said in a university video interview			0
another cool tidbit : inflation can be used in theories that suggest the existence of multiple universes , @entity78 said , although these results do not directly address such theories			2
what are gravitational waves ? scientists believe that in the fabric of space - time , there are tiny ripples called quantum fluctuations			1
if you could look at space - time on the smallest scale possible , you would , in theory , see them , even today			0
unfortunately , no microscope is capable of seeing something that small			0
such fluctuations also existed at the beginning of the universe			0
inflation blew them up much larger , launching gravitational waves that we now see imprinted on the cosmic microwave background			1
" these gravitational waves are an aftershock of the @entity15 , " he said			1
the @entity40 study is the first to image them directly			2
" we have for the first time a detection for the mythical gravity wave signal that people have been searching for so hard , for so long , " said @entity151 , associate professor at the @entity152 , at a press conference monday			0
other experiments such as @entity159 -- @entity17 's @entity159 -- are also looking for proof of gravitational waves , but in the context of energetic cosmic phenomena such as coalescing black holes			1
the gravitational waves suggested by the @entity40 results would have expanded across the entire universe at that time , @entity78 said			1
the length of one of these waves -- the distance between peaks and troughs -- would have been billions of light years across			2
light from the early universe , called cosmic microwave background radiation , reveals these telltale signs of our universe 's history			2
last year , scientists from the @entity185 's @entity184 space telescope released a detailed map of temperature variations in this light , which came from from about 380,000 years after the @entity15			0
better ' baby picture ' of universe emerges instead of temperature , @entity40 scientists were looking specifically at the polarization of the cosmic microwave background -- that is , the direction the electric field is pointing across the sky			1
researchers were looking for a specific type of polarization called " b - modes , " which signify a curling pattern in the polarized orientations of light from the ancient universe , said @entity206 , co-leader of the @entity40 collaboration and professor of physics at @entity17			1
in theory , this swirling polarization pattern could only be created from gravitational waves			1
and that is what @entity40 found			2
" it 's a very clean signature of those gravity waves , " @entity78 said			0
is it for real ? because of how potentially important these results are , they must be viewed with skepticism , said @entity221 , professor of astrophysics at @entity223			0
the measurement is a very difficult one to make and could easily be contaminated			0
there are , as it stands , some " oddities " in the results that could be concerning , he said			0
" i am looking forward to seeing these results confirmed or refuted by other experiments in the next year or two , " @entity221 said			0
the @entity184 space telescope collaboration is expected to release results on polarization of the cosmic microwave background as well , @entity78 said			0
other experiments are working toward similar goals , which could support or go against @entity40			2
regardless , monday 's announcement is making big waves in the scientific community			0
follow @entity242 on @entity243 at @ lizlandau			0

gravitational waves were predicted by @entity30
new results from @entity40 are ' smoking gun for inflation '
during inflation , the universe expanded faster than the speed of light
