-- dubbed " @entity2 's @entity1 , " reggae sensation @entity3 is known not only for bringing his upbeat vibe to audiences across the world , but also for promoting social issues through his extensive humanitarian work			1
the acclaimed singer - songwriter first fell in love with reggae at a young age when he heard a @entity2 military band play a @entity1 song			1
" i remember totally being drawn to the words and also the message and the intentions of the music , " he told @entity0 's @entity15			1
now based in @entity20 , @entity3 has recorded five albums and performed alongside global stars such as @entity23 on some of the world 's biggest stages			1
but perhaps his most impressive feat so far has been the creation of the @entity28 in @entity2 , an annual event that attracts thousands of music lovers and also raises awareness for a series of social causes , including provision of clean water and education for girls			1
an edited version of the interview follows			1
@entity0 : can you describe the first time you ever heard reggae and the feeling it created in you ? @entity3 : the first time i heard reggae music was ( in ) @entity46 , which is a military barracks in @entity2 where i was born			1
there was a military band called @entity50 which used to ... do covers			1
i was interested in music , so every time i used to hang out at their rehearsal			1
and then one time , they started playing covers , @entity1 , and i remember totally being drawn to the words and also the message and the intentions of the music			2
it was really love at first sight			2
and since then i also realized that my calling too was in that direction , using music as that tool to articulate all that i see around me			2
@entity0 : when did you first realize you could sing ? rd : right from the onset , because our environment in @entity73 , everything is music			2
when a child is born , everybody 's singing , when there 's celebration , everybody 's singing			2
so at that time , i just joined in everywhere and i realized that i could ... make up melodies , i was like , this could be an interesting path for me			2
then i started growing in my confidence , i started researching about it and then it just took off from there			2
@entity0 : you grew up being motivated by spreading a message -- how was that received as you were playing your first concerts ? rd : the thing that i believe about messages is that you have to understand that the message is always higher than the messenger			0
so you always have to put the message in such a way that you do n't become preachy , because we 're all on this journey together , everybody who 's part of this human family			0
me having that platform does n't mean that it makes me a person that can be able to point people in the right direction -- i just open options and i create the environment , and that environment creates dialogue			0
and it 's just like , when we start talking amongst each other , we 'll figure it out			0
so i believe in the subtlety of the message			0
@entity0 : which is more important to you , critical acclaim or commercial success ? rd : all of it has its place , but in the long run , my intention ... is that i want the music to be in the hands of everybody , so i do n't look at it more as a commercial thing , i look at it in terms of the message and the communication			0
i want everybody to experience what i have experienced , i want to communicate with everybody			0
i want everybody to feel and understand what message i 'm trying to carry across			0
i want everybody to be part of this new brotherhood of all of us			0
i call it the brotherhood of all of us because everybody is part of it			0
it does n't matter what your background is , what 's your religion , what 's your cultural background , what 's your gender			0
we are all together in this world			0
we are sharing the same space , we are breathing the same air			0
@entity0 : every year you put on a concert called the @entity167 , talk to me about it			0
rd : @entity2 was the first @entity169 country to be independent			1
so i realized that @entity2 's independence day , its importance was not only a matter of celebrating the day , its importance was that this day could be a day we could use to reflect on where @entity73 is			1
and right now ... @entity2 has really taken the leadership role when it comes to having democratic institutions , stability and even economically			1
so @entity2 has really been able to do all things that i feel ... we need to share with the rest of @entity73 as we were the first independent country			1
so i felt that the concert was a means to start this celebration whereby all @entity73 comes and in doing so , there 's the music and there 's also all the dimensions of us interacting with each other			0
so every year , no matter where i am , i go back and then have this event and then also i started using it for social causes			1
we 've worked on everything from water issues to girl child education issues , to hand washing , sanitation issues , @entity198			1
for me , i feel that my talent , whatever @entity201 has given me , my abilities that @entity201 has given me , is for me to utilize for that purpose .			0
