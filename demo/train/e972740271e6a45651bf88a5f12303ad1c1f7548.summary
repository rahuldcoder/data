-- the @entity1 have the most wins , 31 , going into thursday 's @entity3			1
they have the fewest losses , two			0
they were a consensus no. 1 going into @entity8 and are the no. 1 seed in the tourney 's @entity10			1
yet they 're still underdogs			0
where 's @entity14 when you need him ? @entity16 , the hoops statistician behind @entity16 , said he believes the @entity17 earned their no. 1 seed , even if he does n't agree with the polls proclaiming them the nation 's best			1
" they 're seeded appropriately based on my ratings , " said @entity16			0
" i will vouch for @entity1 being a very good team			1
" if you feel a " but " coming , your @entity25 sense is well - tuned			2
@entity16 , a meteorologist whose work on " tempo statistics " has earned him respect among many coaches and analysts , said he believes the sportswriters and coaches who dictate the national rankings are overvaluing the @entity17 ' record			2
the voters may even be unduly charmed by the prospect of a small - conference school from @entity40 , @entity41 , winning the whole shebang , he said			1
it is , after all , quixotic to think that a private , @entity45 school named for a 16th - century saint has the same shot as @entity48 or @entity49			1
but ( there it is ! ) @entity16 's statistics indicate there are three clear favorites in this year 's tournament , and the trio does n't include no. 1 seeds @entity1 or @entity57			1
level playing field ? hold up , wait a minute			0
what about the purported parity ? what about the commentators ' common mantra that this is " anyone 's tournament , " that there are 20 teams who could hang a championship banner from their rafters ? @entity71 , said @entity16 : " it was a pretty typical year			1
" pit your bracket against @entity0 personalities ' it 's true there is no one dominant team , as there was last year when @entity80 ( which sent six players to the @entity82 ) winning it all seemed a foregone conclusion , he said			0
this year 's tournament still has its favorites , however			0
" the numbers say @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity87 are better than ( @entity1 ) right now , " he said			1
the @entity17 come in at no. 4 in @entity16 's rankings , but he is quick to say his " ratings represent a team 's average performance , and teams rarely put in an average performance			2
" plus , history dictates averages do n't mean much when young , hungry ballers take the court to compete for the college hoops crown			2
a bad matchup can sink a clear favorite , as can lights - out three - point shooting or a burst of suffocating defense			2
put simply , @entity16 said , " the tournament is wacky			0
" @entity106 and @entity107 proved that two years ago when they upended everyone 's brackets by charging into the @entity111			0
so , why could n't it happen for the @entity17 ? they 've made 15 straight tournaments since 1999 , an active streak topped only by powerhouses @entity57 ( 24 ) , @entity117 ( 18 ) and @entity118 ( 16 )			2
in that span , they 've made it to the @entity123 16 four times and the @entity124 once			0
@entity1 also has n't lost since january 19 -- to then - 13th - ranked @entity125 -- and while they played only three ranked teams , they did n't slouch during nonconference play , picking up opponents from the @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 doubting @entity132 where , then , is the love ? how can it be that only 5.6 % of @entity136 's millions of @entity138 participants have the @entity17 finishing on top ? why can you tune in to the " the @entity142 " and hear the host repeatedly refer to @entity1 not as the @entity1 , but as the " choking dogs " ? ( @entity145 actually used the word " chokingest " during tuesday 's show			1
) why does @entity148 put @entity1 's odds at 12 to 1 to win it all ? why do those same bookies give @entity1 and @entity152 , the no. 2 seed in the @entity10 , near - similar odds of winning the region ? could it be that in a year when commentators are harping about parity -- a year when schools like @entity158 and @entity159 at - large nods over defending champion @entity80 -- @entity1 is just overhyped ? " it 's easy to come to the conclusion that smaller schools are getting in this year , " said @entity164 , author of " @entity165 : the @entity169 , " but he disagrees			1
the @entity17 " ran through their conference , have some big nonconference wins and they got the no. 1 seed , " he said			1
" it 's nothing to do with being a mid-major			2
they won 31 ball games , and they earned it on the court			2
" @entity164 , who also does radio color commentary for @entity107 basketball games , said he feels the term mid-major is " hollow and shallow and fairly irrelevant these days			1
" @entity1 's sustained success has allowed the school to spread its wings in recruiting , attracting prospects from as far away as @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 -- a geographic reach similar to that of the @entity198			1
the @entity17 pay their head coach of 15 years , @entity200 , more than $ 1 million , putting him just behind the coaches at historically solid basketball schools like @entity203 and @entity204			0
consider also that @entity1 's basketball expenses have risen from $ 1.9 million in 2005 to $ 6.1 million last year , according to the @entity207 @entity206 , which means better facilities and players			1
that does n't keep them in the company of @entity117 ( $ 15.9 million ) and @entity48 ( $ 15.5 million ) , but it does put them ahead of @entity212 ( $ 5.8 million ) and @entity152 ( $ 6 million )			1
' a whole lot of ingredients ' when you combine these factors -- money , recruits , nonconference schedule , years of success -- it 's tough to call a team like @entity1 a mid-major , even if they do hail from the @entity216 , @entity164 said			1
still , there 's some prejudice , he said			0
" when people get into their office , close the door and stare down at that piece of paper , they see @entity48 , @entity117 , @entity57 , " @entity164 said , explaining that those teams ' histories have more sway than they should			1
" history does n't matter			0
all that matters is what this team can do , " he said			0
" but we use that to shape our mindset , and that is part of that mid-major bias			0
it 's similar to why the pundits are n't picking the @entity17 to go to the @entity111			0
" asked where they had the @entity17 in their own brackets , @entity164 said he had them losing in the @entity124 to @entity152 , and @entity16 said he does n't do brackets ; he just likes to watch basketball			1
the consummate statistician , @entity16 noted that the odds were against the @entity17 winning , but that holds true for any team			1
on average , no. 1 seeds win only three games in the tourney			2
you need six for the trophy			0
but @entity1 has " a whole lot of ingredients that go into postseason success , " @entity164 said			2
they have an experienced backcourt , they rebound well , they 're athletic and can run the floor			0
their three - point shooting is decent at 37.1 % , but their team 50.4 % shooting places them second among tournament teams			2
their 77.6 points a game is 12th - best in college hoops			0
add to that the consistency that comes with coach few			0
" if you need a sailboat to be guided through a storm , you want the best doggone captain out there , and that 's @entity200 , " @entity164 said			0
few 's ability to adapt to situations and coach his players in the style he 's crafted over 15 years gives @entity1 the " steady guiding hand " that any team -- big or small -- needs in the tournament , @entity164 said			1
underdog ? @entity291 , bring it @entity40 councilman @entity293 , a second - generation @entity1 alum whose parents had season tickets in the @entity296 days ( 1980 - 1984 , when the @entity297 played guard ) , said the team also has moxie			1
" they 're a special team			0
when they get their backs up against the wall , they push though , " he said , pointing to the @entity302 game when a final - minute @entity304 three - pointer helped @entity1 topple the no. 22 @entity305			1
when the @entity17 take the floor at @entity313 's @entity312 on thursday , @entity310 expects his birthplace to be a " dead town			0
" everyone will be watching @entity317 , he said			0
@entity40 is abuzz with @entity1 's success			1
" @entity17 " and " @entity320 " signs adorn homes , yards , storefronts and car windows			0
during a city meeting on tuesday , no business was addressed for 20 minutes because everyone wanted to talk @entity17 basketball , @entity293 said			2
as for the " no - respect " talk , @entity293 brushes it off			2
the second - smallest city to host the @entity332 , @entity40 welcomes underdog status , and you wo n't hear from residents any " indignation about not getting respect , " @entity293 said			1
" we 're just happy to be from @entity40			2
" since the 1999 run to the @entity124 , @entity1 " has been central to our identity as a city , " he said , and it 's been common in years past for people to have high hopes , idealistically jotting down @entity1 as a @entity111 team in their brackets			1
" but this year , people are picking them to go all the way , " @entity293 said			0
" we 're ranked no. 1 in the polls			0
the next step is the @entity111 , right ? " said @entity164 , " @entity352 forbid they win it all			0

@entity1 have @entity3 - best 31 - 2 record ; @entity148 puts championship odds at 12 - 1
statistician says , despite talk of parity , three teams stand out : @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity87
expert does n't like term mid-major because @entity1 spends like a big school
@entity40 councilman says city likes underdog status , is abuzz with *anticipation* over tourney
