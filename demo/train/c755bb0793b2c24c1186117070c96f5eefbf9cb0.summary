-- the steep rock walls of @entity3 's @entity2 symbolize the slavery , starvation , torture and lost lives of thousands of pows and @entity10 civilians during @entity11 , when @entity12 forced them to build the infamous @entity14 to boost its invasion of @entity16			1
at today 's @entity18 , visitors can share the misery and memories of those years , and learn from survivors who tell what happened and why			1
recently named the best museum in @entity3 and ranked among the top five in @entity10 by @entity25 , the haunting site and museum are called a " must " by the travel website			1
fifty miles away , in the town of @entity31 ( about 75 miles west of @entity32 , near @entity3 's border with @entity16 ) , evocative ceremonies take place annually from november 28 to december 7 during @entity35 , commemorating the @entity37 bombing of the area , which began on november 28 , 1944			2
events include cultural performances , plus a sound and light show portraying the history of the @entity14 , which crossed the so - called @entity44 on its route through @entity2			1
more than 16,000 enslaved @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity50 pows perished at these sites			0
more than 90,000 @entity10 also died from starvation and disease during their forced labor , according to the @entity46 's @entity55			0
together , the sites make this corner of jungle in @entity3 one of the most sobering and evocative places on the planet for travelers with an interest in the horrifying events of @entity11 fatal railway " @entity2 " and " @entity14 " are terms coined by @entity66 whose fate was sealed in a sinister , deadly agreement			1
in august 1942 , @entity3 's prime minister field marshal @entity69 signed an agreement with @entity12 to allow the laying of a single - meter - gauge railway track toward @entity46 colonial @entity16 ( now @entity16 )			1
in october 1943 , @entity12 began transporting troops and supplies on that finished railway through newly carved @entity2 , to support its 1942 @entity16 invasion			1
for slave labor , @entity77 used more than 60,000 pows -- 30,000 @entity46 , 18,000 @entity47 , 13,000 @entity48 and 700 @entity50			0
most were captured when @entity46 surrendered its colonial hold on @entity81 in february 1942 , while other pows were seized in @entity46 's @entity84 and @entity47 - held @entity83			0
about one - fifth of the @entity66 died from untreated diseases and starvation -- they were given watery gruel rations and sadistic punishments while building @entity2 and the @entity14			1
executions of prisoners and laborers were common			0
@entity77 was in a brutal rush , so its commanders in @entity3 forced up to 180,000 @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , tamils and other @entity10 to labor at the sites under similar conditions , according to the @entity55			2
the railway totaled 260 miles ( 415 kilometers ) , including 190 miles ( 304 kilometers ) in @entity3 from @entity102 to @entity2 on the @entity3 - @entity16 border , plus 70 miles ( 111 kilometers ) to reach @entity104 inside @entity16 , where it linked trains to @entity107			1
when the @entity109 began bombing the railway in november 1944 and 1945 , they killed some pows laboring there			2
@entity37 aerial bombing during 1945 also destroyed almost every railway bridge throughout @entity3			1
some railroad tracks near @entity31 survived the war , but @entity2 disappeared amid jungle growth			2
visiting @entity2 in the 1980s , a handful of @entity48 survivors rediscovered the overgrown @entity2 section of the route and campaigned to turn it into a memorial			1
guided tours are now available , but many people prefer to linger on their own			0
while most tourists visit the @entity129 bridge and main pow cemetery at @entity31 , others say they experience stronger and more profound feelings at @entity2			2
taxis and local buses are available between the sites			0
you can walk through @entity2 's narrow 85 - foot - deep ( 26 meter ) trench in the @entity137 along its 1,640 - foot - long ( 500 meter ) track			1
pows and forced laborers painstakingly hacked open the mass of solid rock using hand tools , making it wide enough for the train to slide through			0
nearby , the @entity25 top - rated and air - conditioned @entity145 is run by the @entity146			1
it offers videos , photographs , drawings , tools and testimony			0
the highly recommended portable audio headset includes the voices of survivors who describe atrocities they endured , which you can listen to while wandering between @entity2 's stone walls			1
from the museum , a walking trail of a few hundred yards leads to @entity2 , also called the @entity161 , and you can continue walking down the abandoned railway line for a couple of miles			1
that route reveals a gorgeous valley , other rock " cutting " railway passes and a couple of trestle bridges			0
the jungle is often hot and humid , with voracious mosquitoes			0
visitors unprepared to deal with either usually find the going uncomfortable			0
nearby @entity11 attractions back in town , the manicured @entity31 " @entity180 " @entity176 includes most of the @entity66 ' remains recovered from nearby mass graves			1
pows are also interred at nearby @entity182 , and in @entity16 at @entity104			2
the excellent @entity3 - @entity183 , next to the cemetery , displays research by an @entity48 who was a @entity187 manager of the @entity31 and @entity182 war cemeteries			2
the center includes extensive details about the railway , @entity2 , pow camps and cemetery sites in @entity3 , plus biographies and artifacts			1
visitors can also tour @entity31 's @entity3 - owned @entity197 and @entity198			1
managed by a @entity3 @entity202 temple , the @entity200 's design is similar to the bamboo - and - thatch shacks where @entity66 were housed , and displays pow testimonies and paintings , plus news reports and other objects			2
scary , painted wooden effigies show life - sized prisoners being tortured , dying and laboring on the railway , alongside statues of @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and other wartime leaders			0
the acronym @entity200 indicates the countries of @entity12 , @entity218 , @entity48 , @entity3 and @entity219 , which were intertwined in the @entity14 's creation			1
@entity221 was the so - called " @entity44 , " a pow - built steel and concrete structure with 11 curved spans			0
next to that was a wooden trestle railway bridge , still partially preserved			0
both bridges were completed in 1943 , and repeatedly bombed by @entity46 and @entity50 warplanes			0
today , tourists can take a short train ride across a fully functional , duplicate " @entity44 " closer to @entity31 -- built to resemble the obliterated original			0
you can also walk across the bridge and take boats on the river below			0
@entity2 in popular culture the @entity14 's main structure was immortalized in the partially fictional 1957 movie classic , " @entity44			1
" in 2013 , @entity240 and @entity241 starred in " @entity242 , " portraying @entity14 survivor and former pow @entity244			2
