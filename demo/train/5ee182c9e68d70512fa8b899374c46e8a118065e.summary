-- a small plane with an unresponsive pilot sank in the @entity4 on thursday after circling above the ocean for more than two hours , then crashing , the @entity1 reported			1
the twin - engine @entity7 remained afloat with its tail sticking out of the water for some time before it sank thursday afternoon , said petty officer @entity10 , a @entity10 spokeswoman			2
no remains have been found , and the @entity1 still considered its operation an active search and rescue			1
there was no sign of the pilot , @entity10 said			2
the plane went down about about 120 miles west of @entity18 , @entity19 , at 12:08 p.m. after circling the eastern @entity4 for more than two hours , said chief petty officer @entity20 , a @entity20 spokesman			2
the crew of a @entity1 search - and - rescue plane watched as the @entity7 made what appeared to be a soft landing , @entity20 said			1
a @entity1 plane from the @entity18 area and the cutter @entity27 were still taking part in the search thursday evening , and the @entity27 was expected to remain at the scene overnight , @entity10 said			1
the plane took off from @entity33 , @entity34 , en route to @entity36 , @entity19 , with a single pilot on board			1
it had been circling at an altitude of about 28,000 feet , a @entity40 source told @entity0			0
the @entity43 began monitoring the plane after noticing it flying erratically over the @entity4 on thursday morning , and planes sent up to investigate it reported the @entity7 's windows were either iced or fogged over , @entity20 said			1
pilots at the @entity49 said the victim was dr. @entity51 , a cosmetic surgeon who was well known in the area			1
" i 've lost a dear friend , just a great guy , " pilot @entity53 told @entity0 affiliate @entity54			0
" @entity58 doctor and just a regular guy that would do anything for anybody			0

but aviation expert @entity75 told @entity0 the circumstances point toward a possible loss of cabin pressure in the eight - seat , propeller - driven aircraft			0
" at 28,000 feet , you do n't have an awful lot of useful consciousness without the support of oxygen or being in a pressurized aircraft , " said @entity75 , a former @entity0 correspondent			0
if a lone pilot is incapacitated at that altitude , " there are n't a lot of options for resuscitating him and getting him back flying			2
" fellow pilot @entity92 told @entity54 that @entity51 maintained his plane meticulously and spared no expense to keep it in " tip - top shape			2
" @entity92 said @entity51 was an accomplished pilot and that the flight should have been routine , " but when something goes wrong , obviously you have nowhere to go when you 're out over the ocean			0
