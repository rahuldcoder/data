around this time each year , as i prepare for @entity1 , i anticipate the flood of new and exciting innovations that will be announced , the inspiring people i 'll be meeting and the general buzz around mobile on a global scale			0
i also hope that i will see more women in attendance at the show			0
it 's no secret that the technology sector currently has a dearth of women in the workforce			1
there has already been considerable discussion and research about the fact that girls are not choosing to study @entity22 ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) subjects , how a divide exists between men and women with access to the @entity32 , how much gdp could increase if the number of digital jobs held by women was on a par with men ... the list goes on			2
clearly we need more women working in the mobile and @entity43 industry , and more women getting connected by mobile			1
in other words , we are calling for more mobile women -- empowered by mobile and upwardly mobile as a result			2
making women aware of the many opportunities enabled by mobile -- and holding challenging and well - remunerated positions -- is a passion of mine			2
i always knew i wanted to work in an exciting and innovative industry			0
i recognized that computer science and telecoms were burgeoning sectors , and i pursued them knowing that this unchartered territory would be rife with opportunities			0
even at the start of my career , i had a desire to make a difference in an environment that was constantly evolving and pioneering			0
two decades later , the industry is still just as exciting			0
however , while new generations of women are increasingly embracing technology in their everyday lives , they may not realize just how dynamic it is to work in mobile and @entity43			1
i will dispel the myth now : hardly anyone i know who works in technology is a " geek " who sits glued to their computer screen for 20 hours a day			0
of course there are enormous opportunities for people with deep technological skills , but there are just as many for people who want to support the full potential of mobile , whether it 's creating connected cars , advancing mobile commerce , or even designing the master plan for a smart city			0
there are opportunities to do almost anything			0
in fact , women in the @entity43 industry earn almost 9 % more than those in other parts of the economy			1
yet they constitute only 30 % of the @entity43 workforce in @entity107 , and also often leave the industry early , missing out on the chance to get to the top			1
we need to make women in mobile and ict the norm rather than the exception -- and also encourage those that are on the path not to abandon it			1
so how do we attract and retain more mobile women ? motivating women to work in the mobile industry needs to start from the ground up , ensuring they are given the opportunities and guidance to pursue @entity22 subjects in the first place , provided with practical experience like internships in the field , and also inspired by the potential of mobile to change people 's lives			1
many women in developing nations become mobile through ownership of their first mobile phone			2
the positive impact that mobile has on everyday life is perhaps felt most strongly in these markets , where mobile services provide critical connectivity , life - enhancing access to education and healthcare , and empowerment through entrepreneurship			0
the transformative power of mobile for women was clearly demonstrated when @entity152 operator @entity151 launched a line of products and services to target the needs of women , who at the time comprised only 20 % of their subscribers			1
the result ? less than three years later , @entity151 has increased its female customer base to 40 % , enriching the lives of nearly two million @entity152 women who are now connected and empowered with more social and financial independence			2
we know that regardless of their locality or social strata , the positive effect of more mobile women around the world can transcend the industry and have much wider socioeconomic benefits			1
so as we collectively strive to connect the next one billion users and stimulate the positive change that the mobile internet brings , we must ensure that women will be included in this upsurge			2
to do this , we need to address the entire mobile ecosystem			0
it starts with mobilizing the stakeholders involved -- policymakers and educators , mobile operators , manufacturers , and suppliers -- and extends to women themselves recognizing the myriad opportunities for their talents in the mobile and @entity43 industry			1
as i look back on many industry events where i addressed and interacted with a large number of male colleagues , i look forward to many more where i 'll be just one of many involved , dynamic , mobile women			1
