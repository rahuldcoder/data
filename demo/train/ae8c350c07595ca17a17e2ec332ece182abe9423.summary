-- @entity2 journalist @entity1 was beheaded by his @entity4 captors to send a message to the western world			1
and he is not the only westerner held by the militant group			0
the video of his execution , posted to @entity11 , shows another @entity2 journalist , identified as @entity13			1
the @entity4 fighter makes it clear the captive 's fate hangs in the balance -- he will be killed , @entity4 said , if the @entity2 does not end its military operations in @entity20			1
thousands of @entity21 and @entity20 have been slain by @entity4 militants as the @entity24 extremist group seeks to build an @entity26 caliphate stretching across a swath of territory			1
but the execution of @entity31 captives holds greater shock value outside the region 's borders -- and represents a powerful propaganda tool			1
alternatively , those hostages , often journalists or aid workers , can be a useful tool if kept alive : either freed for hefty ransoms , used as bargaining chips for the militants ' ends or sold on to other extremist groups			1
it 's hard to know how many captives there are because governments , employers and families tend to keep kidnappings quiet for fear of putting the victims in greater danger while negotiators work to secure their release			1
but @entity4 is believed to be holding a number of @entity2 , including @entity13 , a @entity2 official told @entity0 on wednesday			1
the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , declined to identify them or say exactly how many @entity2 are being held			1
missing journalists the @entity63 estimates that about 20 journalists are missing in @entity21 -- most of them local , some from outside @entity21			0
it says many of them are believed to be held by @entity4			1
among them is @entity69 , a freelance journalist who was contributing articles to the @entity72			2
@entity73 disappeared in @entity21 in august 2012			0
there has been no word of or from him since his abduction			0
more than 80 journalists have been abducted in @entity21 , according to the @entity63 -- a number the organization says is unprecedented in the three decades since it was founded			0
some have been freed , others killed			0
often a media blackout on journalists ' abductions is lifted only in best - and worst - case scenarios			2
it emerged this week that @entity2 special operations units were sent into @entity21 this summer to rescue @entity1 and other hostages -- but their mission proved unsuccessful			1
@entity91 , a spokesman for the news website @entity93 , also revealed that @entity4 had demanded a ransom of 100 million euros ( about $ 132 million ) for @entity1 's release			1
the journalist freelanced for @entity93 and other news organizations			2
' they are innocents ' @entity1 's mother , @entity99 , expressed concern for other hostages on the free james foley facebook page			2
" we implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages			2
like @entity107 , they are innocents			0
they have no control over @entity2 government policy in @entity20 , @entity21 or anywhere in the world , " she wrote			1
fears for the safety of @entity31 held by @entity117 militants have also highlighted the different approaches taken by governments when it comes to kidnappings			1
the @entity123 government has a hard - line policy of never paying ransoms			1
the @entity2 government also does not negotiate with terrorists			1
at the same time , other @entity129 governments in the past are thought to have handed over cash to terror groups to ensure the release of nationals			1
the @entity2 , as in the case with the thwarted @entity1 mission , has in the past attempted hostage rescues			1
sometimes these can work out , as happened in 2012 when @entity139 rescued @entity2 aid worker @entity140 and fellow aid worker @entity141 of @entity143 after three months ' captivity in @entity145			1
they had been abducted while traveling there for the @entity148			0
but sometimes such attempts fail			0
@entity150 , a kidnapped @entity123 aid worker , was accidentally killed by a @entity2 grenade during a seal rescue bid in @entity153 in 2010			1
tortured , beaten in captivity while negotiations for potential releases continue , little or nothing is made public about the hostages ' plight			2
but slowly details are emerging of the experiences endured by @entity1 following his abduction while on a reporting trip in northern @entity21 in november 2012			0
a source who says he was held last year with @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity165 that he , @entity1 and another journalist were held from march to august 2013 in a prison in @entity168 , @entity21			2
at the time , the source -- who spoke on condition of anonymity -- said they were being held by the @entity173 , a @entity21 rebel group with @entity175 ties			0
at one point , according to the source , there were nearly 100 people -- including @entity129 journalists -- in the prison			0
the source says @entity1 and the other journalist , who was not @entity13 , were transferred to an @entity4 training camp			1
@entity1 and the other journalist , according to the source , were tortured in prison -- mostly beaten			0
' @entity1 had to endure more ' @entity187 journalist @entity186 , who was taken hostage in june 2013 with @entity187 photographer @entity189 , told @entity0 that he also had been held with @entity1 in northern @entity21 before his release this year			1
" we spent seven months together out of the 10 months that i was held in captivity			0
most of the time our condition was ok -- but at the beginning and end of our time , we were not treated very well , " he said , speaking from @entity194			0
" @entity1 especially had to endure more because he was @entity2			2
he was missing his family and would talk often about them			0
" @entity1 said he had been initially kidnapped by jihadists fighting in @entity21 , @entity201 told @entity203			0
that group eventually became part of the @entity4 movement			2
@entity201 and @entity189 were released along with two other @entity187 journalists , @entity208 and @entity209 , on april 19			0
it 's not known what went on behind the scenes to secure their freedom , but @entity187 foreign minister @entity214 insisted that @entity187 had not paid a ransom , @entity210 reported at the time			2
other westerners held in @entity21 also have been released in recent months			0
two @entity218 journalists held for more than six months in @entity21 , @entity220 staff correspondent @entity219 and freelance photographer @entity221 , were freed in march			0
at the time of their capture , @entity220 said the journalists ' captors were reported to be members of a group linked to @entity4			2
and a @entity143 photographer , @entity229 , was freed in june , the @entity230 said , having been held captive in @entity21 since may 2013			0
@entity0 's @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 has other @entity31 hostages , including journalist identified as @entity13
hostages can be useful bargaining chips or *exchanged* for ransom payments
@entity2 and @entity123 governments have policy against paying ransom for hostages
abductions are often kept quiet for fear of *jeopardizing* efforts to secure victims ' release
