@entity0 -- with " candor comes a measure of vulnerability			2
" @entity5 wants readers to know in the first pages of her new memoir that this will be different from other books by members of the @entity12			1
the dynamic story of the first @entity14 to sit as a justice seeks to inspire by revealing often - painful chapters in her self - described " extraordinary journey " : her father 's early death from alcoholism ; a complex , often distant relationship with her mother ; growing up poor in the @entity26 projects ; self - doubts about her looks , brief failed marriage ; and professional path			1
but her strengths are celebrated , too : self - reliance to the point of giving herself insulin shots at age 7 , after being diagnosed with diabetes ; her loyalty to a large circle of friends ; and vivid pride in her @entity42 heritage			1
" experience has taught me you can not value dreams according to the odds of their coming true , " she writes in " @entity43 " ( @entity45 / @entity44 )			1
" their real value is in stirring within us the will to aspire			2
that will , wherever it finally leads , does at least move you forward			2
" she will speak this week in depth to @entity1 's @entity60 and @entity1 en @entity62 's @entity61			2
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the 58 - year - old @entity5 was named to the high court in 2009 after 17 years as a federal judge in @entity65			1
her autobiography ends as she takes the bench in 1992			2
the narrative is often hauntingly personal : no legal analyses here			2
anyone seeking to glean her views of hot - button political issues like abortion , health care reform , or same - sex marriage will be disappointed			1
@entity77 speaks in court some of the most vivid recollections concern her type 1 diabetes			1
@entity5 recounts how she gave herself the shots of out necessity , with her mother gone much of the day at work , and her father 's illness causing his hands to tremble			1
and within her from that early age was a sense of destiny she has struggled at times to shape			2
when young @entity5 was diagnosed in 1962 , the prospects of living a full life past her 40s were not good			1
" i 've lived most of my life inescapably aware that it is precious and finite , " she writes			2
" the reality of diabetes always lurked in the back of my mind , and early on i accepted the probability that i would die young			2
" in many ways she considers that decades - long awareness a " gift " -- to persevere , grasp life at its fullest every day			1
she now manages her illness with ease -- at public events she has been seen giving herself needle shots , with hardly anyone noticing			0
@entity5 deals candidly with death , especially her father @entity61 's spiral from drink , and the effect it had on @entity5 's mother especially			1
the loving daughter recalls the bottles of booze the family later discovered hidden in " @entity123 's " bedroom , including under the mattress			0
her beloved cousin @entity126 's early death from @entity127 is chronicled			0
in one amazing scene , she unwittingly drives him in his last weeks to an " appointment			0
" " he asked me to wait , so i sat in the car , parked outside the rundown tenement in @entity133 ( a neighborhood in the @entity26 ) , " she recalls			0
" inside he 'd been scoring heroin			0
i wanted to kick myself -- how could anyone , let alone an assistant district attorney who 'd seen everything i 'd seen , be so naive			0
i recited that essential lesson of @entity123 's , simplistic but true : good people can do bad things , make bad choices			0
it does n't make them bad people			0
" even @entity5 's long smoking habit -- puffing up to three and a half packs a day -- gets the full unvarnished treatment , especially the difficulties of her quitting			1
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the other driving narrative in this memoir is her heritage , rich with stories of childhood visits to the island of her parents ' birth			1
she intimately describes the sounds and smells of her @entity26 neighborhood too , especially the weekly visits to her paternal grandmother @entity162 -- whom she called @entity164 -- where food , dancing , and poetry readings brought some of the happiest moments of her childhood			0
pizza bomber appeal rejected the justice says an innate awareness of larger forces around her often - chaotic childhood helped ground her , leaving the girl more trusting of her own instincts than what her once - distant mother and catholic school education could provide			1
her motto when she was in doubt : " listen carefully and observe until i figured things out			0
" @entity186 's evident intelligence and self - determination were boosted by affirmative action , just getting a hold in @entity191 society in the early 1970s , when she began applying for college			1
@entity5 admits not being fully aware of its impact in her own life at that age , but certain polar memories still leave a bad taste			1
a fellow @entity200 student criticized her for not being more militant about the discrimination @entity200 were facing , while a high school employee baldly questioned whether as an underprivileged minority she truly deserved to go to @entity204			1
" i felt like an alien landing in a different universe , " she says of her early college days , relating an experience shared by many of her minority friends			0
" there were vultures circling , ready to dive when we stumbled			0
the pressure to succeed was relentless , even if self - imposed out of fear and insecurity			2
" she drove herself hard to overcome that doubt , determined to prove critics wrong			0
" i had been admitted to the @entity221 through a special door , and i had more ground than most to make up before i was competing with my classmates on an equal footing , " she writes			0
but " to doubt the worth of minority students ' achievement when they succeed is really only to present another face of the prejudice that would deny them a chance even to try			0
" the young woman from the @entity26 projects graduated with honors from @entity204 and later @entity236			0
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @entity5 is unmarried , has no children , and her laser focus on her work as a prosecutor , private lawyer , and later justice -- she admits somewhat sadly -- has often been at the sacrifice of greater personal growth			1
she concedes that her intensity and drive has initially turned off some people			0
her longtime paralegal developed hives when dealing with the often - brusque new boss for the first time			2
@entity5 also overheard a law firm colleague describe her as " one tough bitch " who would not be pushed around by adversaries			1
" i was shaken to hear myself so harshly categorized , " she recalls			0
" when i 'm focused intensely on work , i become oblivious to social cues , or any cues for that matter			0
" seeing @entity5 on the high court , zeroing in on a lawyer 's presentation at oral argument , is to witness that blend of street - smart manner , combined with a steely intellect			1
she does not mess around			0
but in private , her demeanor is another story			0
when talking with her in small , intimate settings , @entity5 quickly , easily makes you the sole center of her attention , bringing a warm smile and understanding manner			1
being single has also allowed her time to embrace the many dozens of relatives and colleagues -- many of them mentors -- she holds close to her , her " familia			0
" " i 've always turned the families of friends into family of my own , " she writes proudly			0
in her newest role , @entity5 has become an international role model , something she admits can be affecting and overwhelming at the same time			1
" my education continues on the @entity12 as i reckon with the particular demands of the finality of review , " in the decisions the justice and her eight colleagues issue			1
she ends her book , " my highest aspiration for my work on the court is to grow in understanding beyond what i can foresee , beyond any borders visible from this vantage			2

@entity12 @entity5 has a new memoir , " @entity43 "
she is the first @entity14 to sit on the high court
the 58 - year - old was named to the court in 2009 after 17 years as a federal judge
