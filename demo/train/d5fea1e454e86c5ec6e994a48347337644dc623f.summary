-- it seems people only pay attention anymore when the rocket blows up			2
just seconds into its launch tuesday evening , the @entity8 rocket , carrying supplies to the @entity6 , suffered an explosion in the aft end of its first stage , fell back onto the launch pad and blew up in a spectacular fireball			2
within minutes , the major news organizations had picked up the story and began running live interviews of eyewitnesses and experts			2
we learned of the experiments that were being transported to the @entity6 , including several student / school science projects			2
had all gone as planned , the news of the launch would have earned scant mention , and certainly very few in the general public would have known anything about what was on board			0
twenty years ago , i launched on my first space shuttle mission			1
at the time , the @entity35 trial was under way , and i understand that at least one major tv news station , covering the launch live , waited until we had cleared the launch pad tower , then immediately relegated our ascent into a small corner of the screen in order to go back live to the trial			0
in a way , we are victims of our own success			0
people have gotten so used to successful flights that nothing gets their attention unless there is a mishap			0
and , maybe that 's ok			1
one day , spaceflight should advance to the point of being routine , not unlike air travel			0
we 've come a long way since launching the early astronauts into space more than 50 years ago , but accidents like this serve as a reminder that spaceflight still should not be taken for granted			1
by their nature , rockets and rocket engines are unforgiving , containing complex components , which must work correctly to get into space			1
although the @entity8 explosion was a significant mishap , we will get through this			0
the accident investigation team will determine the root cause			0
we will learn from it and build even more robust rockets in the future			0
the crew on board @entity6 do not face any immediate shortages , although the shortfall from this failure will have to be made up			0
without a doubt , critics will arise and question why we are entrusting cargo deliveries and future crew exchanges to commercial companies			1
the answer is simple : it is the logical evolution of technology and commercialization , following the same path as the development of the airplane and commercial air transportation			1
there is plenty of government oversight of airline operations , as there is plenty of such oversight of commercial space operations through @entity103 and the @entity104			1
this mishap is painful , but it is only a speed bump on the way to the commercialization of spaceflight			1
we will get there , and it will be soon			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity116 .			1

former space shuttle *commander* : we tend to focus on the launches that fail
he says it 's a reminder of the *difficulty* of space flight but we will get through this
@entity116 : critics will ask whether it signals *privatization* of space is a *mistake*
he says space flight is following other *industries* , like airplanes , toward commercialization
