as a guy with a @entity3 physique , competing on the same runway with a @entity6 contestant was never on my bucket list			1
yet , there i was , alone with the stunning @entity10 2014 , as we eyeballed each other 's outfits head to toe			2
@entity15 , who will battle for the planet 's most prestigious tiara this weekend at the 63rd annual @entity6 , was wearing a form - fitting ivory mini dress with black leather go - go boots			1
i was wearing a sleeveless purple satin v - neck dress with neon yellow reeboks			2
" i like your dress , " she said , without the slightest trace of irony			2
pretending to be used to such compliments , i replied , " right back at ya ! " before awkwardly turning the conversation to @entity32 's geography , of which i knew nothing			0
( note to self : the next time i hang out with miss @entity32 , remember that her home city of @entity39 is the capital			1
) the " runway " we shared last fall was one mile of pavement along the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			0
we were fellow participants in the " @entity48 " charity race for @entity50 , an organization that trains airport employees to spot and report human trafficking			0
dozens of women and men stampeded in formal gowns and party dresses for the fundraiser , prompting ms. @entity15 to switch out her high - heeled boots for sneakers			0
before the race , as miss @entity32 's bodyguard snapped pics of us with her mobile phone , i imagined what she might be texting her friends and family back home : " @entity69 : if this contestant in the purple dress is a preview of my competition , this pageant will be a breeze ! " her real @entity77 feed was much kinder , praising me and another male bridesmaid for our " courage			1
" for the same reasons i love the " it 's a @entity84 " ride at @entity83 , i always look forward to watching the @entity6 contest			1
it 's a kitschy , utopian universe where countries are supposed to set aside their petty rivalries and hatreds and pretend to be bffs			1
critics can dismiss it as a sexualized hybrid of the @entity93 and the sports illustrated swimsuit issue			0
but for the three hours the contestants stand on stage , it does n't matter how big their country 's army is , the size of the nation 's gross national product , or whether it has nuclear weapons			0
it 's fascinating to see if that fa√ßade can even last three hours			0
this week miss @entity106 weathered a @entity109 crisis at home for posing in a selfie taken by @entity112 along with miss @entity113 and miss @entity115			1
it is against @entity119 law to make contact with @entity121			0
although she is smiling in the picture , miss @entity106 accused miss @entity124 of " photobombing " her , and it 's understandable why she 's running scared			1
in 1993 , miss @entity106 @entity127 was stripped of her title when she posed with the then - @entity124			1
the miss universe facebook page is filled with fun - spirited group pics like this : random contestants frolicking on the beach , strutting on the golf course , hugging local children and taking @entity137 dance classes			1
i kid you not , miss @entity141 and miss @entity143 even had a " roomie - pajama party " wearing matching socks ! ( exclamation point is the pageant 's , not mine			2
) what will happen if miss @entity124 and miss @entity106 both make the top 5 on sunday night ? how about @entity152 and miss @entity153 ? will contestants from any of the former @entity157 bloc countries -- miss @entity158 , @entity160 , @entity161 -- give miss @entity152 the stink eye ? just like the @entity165 , the @entity6 pageant encourages people ( on stage and at home ) to momentarily be classy and see each other as individuals versus national or ethnic stereotypes			1
not that any of the millions of viewers around the globe will be asking for a geography lesson , but the competition also forces people to wonder : " so where exactly is @entity177 ? " and " how cool is it to have an ampersand in your country 's name ? " back to my personal competition with miss @entity32 , i surprised myself by crossing the finish line a few minutes ahead of her			2
for unknown reasons , she chose to walk ( well , glide ) through the race course and coolly acted as if winning were unimportant			0
however , ms. @entity15 could soundly defeat me in a burping contest			2
according to her official @entity6 bio , miss @entity32 can burp " more than 50 times in a row			1
" all those curves must do wonders for the acoustics			0
i 'll definitely be rooting for her to win it all			0
how could i not ? she liked my dress .			0

@entity202 : @entity6 contest a kitschy , utopian event where nations put aside their rivalries and act like @entity206
