" both candidates believe @entity1 deserves a bigger share of their national wealth , " @entity76 said			2

" " @entity13 might be giving voters what they want to hear : a version of a muscular and assertive @entity1 whose wealth has flowed out of @entity1 and been seized by foreign countries			1
that message may be resonating with voters			2
" questions over @entity13 @entity13 , a former son - in - law of @entity1 president @entity132 , has sought to project an image of a take - charge leader			1
having never served in public office , the former lieutenant general has campaigned hard on his military service			0
and that has appealed to the nation which has had a history of military leaders			0
" i think @entity13 has the character of a firm leader and at this point what @entity1 needs is a leader who is very strong , " said @entity142 , an @entity1 voter			1
" when i say firm , it does n't mean someone who just speaks loudly , but someone who is decisive			0

in 2000 , @entity13 was denied a visa to the @entity12 , believed to stem from his human rights record			2

" of course he makes statements about human rights , but it is murky , " said @entity166 of @entity167			0
" someone who is accused of making human rights abuses and fired from his job as a general , now talking about human rights , is problematic			0
" one @entity1 poll indicated about a third of voters know about the human rights questions pertaining to @entity13			1
" i do think that human rights and the question over @entity13 's record has made impact on voters , particularly on swing voters ' or undecided voters ' political behavior , " said @entity179 , a former student activist in 1998 and masters candidate at @entity181			1
economic class schisms earlier this year , @entity8 appeared to be a virtual lock for the presidency as he enjoyed double - digit leads in various polls			1

" we want to see this election proceed in a clean , honest way so that it can produce a clean and honest leader who is willing to serve the people , " he told @entity2			0
as the campaign wore into the summer , @entity8 's polling numbers took a hit			2
" the @entity13 camp has been effective at negatively defining @entity8 as weak on policy substance and basically not ready for the national stage , " @entity76 said			1
" in campaigns , you have to define your opponent first , and @entity13 did that very effectively			2
" the bulk of his support came from the poorer @entity1			2
" i choose @entity8 because i can see that he cares for the poor and marginalized , " said @entity226 , an @entity1 voter in @entity0			1
meanwhile , the bulk of @entity1 's upper class tends to back @entity13 , according to polling data			1
but the race may boil down to swing voters			1
" the 15 % swing voters will be crucial , said @entity234 , a @entity235 professor who specializes in political psychology			1
" these voters , they come from the middle class , they 're very skeptical and more knowledgeable ... it 's the key to win the election			1
