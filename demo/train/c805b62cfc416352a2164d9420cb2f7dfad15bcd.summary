citing a lack of evidence , @entity1 authorities released from prison 65 men thursday over strong objections from @entity8 officials , who said they pose a threat to security forces and civilians			1
" we took this decision according to our law , " said @entity12 , the @entity1 attorney general			2
in a statement posted on its website , the @entity8 @entity16 in @entity17 called the move " deeply regrettable , " saying the @entity1 government " bears responsibility for the results of its decision			1
" @entity26 , head of the @entity27 , said the attorney general ordered the releases from the @entity29 -- formerly known as @entity31 prison -- after a careful review of 88 cases			0
the @entity8 military in @entity1 said some of the men are linked to attacks that killed or wounded 32 @entity8 or coalition service members and 23 @entity1 security personnel or civilians			1
but a 23 - page document obtained by @entity44 @entity43 correspondent @entity42 from a @entity8 military official who asked not to be identified said about 19 of the released men were associated with direct attacks that killed or wounded 60 @entity8 or coalition force members			1
there was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy			0
according to the document , 25 of the men were linked to the production or placement of @entity55 ; 33 tested positive for explosive residue when processed after capture ; and 26 were associated with attacks that killed or wounded 57 @entity1 citizens and @entity60			1
prior to the prisoners ' release , @entity8 authorities had repeatedly aired their displeasure over the plans			2
" we have made clear our judgment that these individuals should be prosecuted under @entity1 law			2
we requested that the cases be carefully reviewed , " the @entity8 military said ahead of the release			1
" but the evidence against them was never seriously considered , including by the attorney general , given the short time since the decision was made to transfer these cases to the @entity1 legal system			2
" releasing them , the embassy said , " is contrary to @entity1 's commitment in our 2012 @entity79 to take all necessary steps to ensure that detainees do not pose a continuing threat to @entity1 , the international community or the @entity8			1
" @entity87 secretary general @entity86 said he was " gravely concerned " by the decision , " which appears to have been made based on political calculations and without regard for due process before the @entity1 courts			0
" in a statement , he called it " a major step backwards for the rule of law in @entity1			0
" the @entity8 military noted that the group included an alleged @entity99 explosives expert , a suspected @entity101 commander and a specialist accused of building and placing improvised explosive devices			1
" these individuals are dangerous , " @entity106 spokeswoman @entity105 said wednesday			0
" they pose threats to the safety and security of the @entity1 people and the @entity1 state			0
" @entity1 president @entity113 defended the releases and slammed the @entity8 for criticizing them			1
the decisions were made only after " rigorous and repeated investigations and fact - finding , " he told reporters in @entity120 , where he met with representatives of @entity122 and @entity123			0
" @entity1 is a sovereign country , " he said			0
" if the @entity1 authorities decide to release a prisoner , it is of no concern to the @entity8 and should be of no concern to the @entity8 and i hope that the @entity8 would stop harassing @entity1 's procedures and judicial authority and i hope that the @entity8 will now begin to respect @entity1 sovereignty			1
" @entity113 also addressed the question of whether he will sign a bilateral security agreement ( @entity134 ) with @entity135 that would allow for @entity8 and other coalition forces to remain in @entity1 after this year			2
" there must be first the launch of the peace process before the @entity134 is signed , " he said			0
" now this condition is not an opposition to @entity134 ; it is a facilitator of the @entity134			0
i put this condition not to oppose the signing of @entity134 but to promote , facilitate the signing of the @entity134 with the @entity8 , and i hope that it should be understood in the same terms			0

" it is of no concern to the @entity8 , " says @entity1 president about the prisoner release
the @entity8 @entity16 in @entity17 says the prisoner release is " deeply regrettable "
the @entity8 military says some of those freed are linked to attacks on @entity8 troops
@entity1 says it does *n't* have enough evidence to keep them behind bars
