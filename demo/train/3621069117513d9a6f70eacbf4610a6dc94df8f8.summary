-- you could n't really call him a " @entity3 " in the grander context of @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 or that annoyingly resilient cat - fancier @entity8			1
those guys were schemers , planners , twisted visionaries of mass apocalypse whose @entity15 were to be played out at humanity 's expense			0
they thought they were so much smarter than the rest of us that it made it easier to invest our collective hope that @entity23 would ultimately ruin their parties			2
but @entity26 ? we could never get as worked up about him any more than you get upset about a lower - level employee called upon do to a dirty job , even if the employee is over 7 feet tall and has the chromium grill of a compact car for teeth			1
in the fantasy universe of henchmen and human tool - kits , @entity26 was the uberstooge , an angel of death who could n't soar far or fast enough to deliver the coup de grace to 007			1
it 's not that we ( necessarily ) rooted for @entity26 any more than we really wanted @entity45 to catch the @entity46			1
wait , maybe we did			0
jaws often resembled that poor scrawny desert wretch whenever he fell ( literally ) short of his quarry			0
in any case , we had so much fun watching him chase @entity55 's plummy - voiced version of @entity23 in 1977 's " @entity56 " that we cheered upon first seeing him return in 1979 's " @entity58			1
" imagine how @entity6 's henchman @entity59 would have been received if his hat had n't gotten caught in that electrified grill			0
monstrous as @entity26 was , there was something deep inside that made us feel a little sorry for him when having all that muscle and menace and grillwork did him little good			2
( i mean , c'mon , man , you can take down a real shark by yourself , but ca n't do away with a smarty - pants secret agent smaller than you ? ) the man who played the role , @entity76 , died wednesday in @entity78 at 74			1
and it 's no surprise to learn , from an interview he did in 2009 , that he insisted on making him less a walking prop and more like a person with such " human characteristics " as " frustration " and " perseverance			0
" there was more of the latter than the former in @entity76 's post-bond career			0
he embraced his @entity26 - inspired notoriety with abiding grace and generosity			2
he continued to act , became a born - again @entity95 after a bout with alcoholism and even co-wrote a biography of the @entity100 abolitionist @entity99 for whom the @entity102 - born @entity101 was originally named			0
with @entity76 's passing , you suddenly realize how inimitable @entity26 was			1
is there anybody like him in movies now ? @entity109 , maybe , the pro wrestling circuit , is there anybody like him anywhere ?			0

@entity113 : @entity26 was n't standard , scheming @entity23 **villain** . he was no @entity5 or @entity7
we wanted @entity23 to beat them . but @entity26 more a low - level employee : scary , not hateful , he says
he says late actor , @entity76 , who played @entity26 , said he tried to make him more human
@entity123 : his passing makes you realize how *singular* his **villain** was ; no one else like him
