-- the premise seemed easy enough			0
let 's get six kids poised to enter kindergarten together to ask what they expect from their " big " school , which is how my littlest one referred to kindergarten before she started			1
i have a child who entered kindergarten last year and another who started the year before , which means i should know you have to be prepared for anything with a group of six rambunctious little ones			2
but that was not top of mind			0
neither was this thought : what was i actually thinking trying to interview kids ? i had those cute @entity26 commercials in my head			1
you 've surely seen them			0
a guy sitting around with a small group of precocious kids who say the darndest things , like the one where the adorable girl says she wants to turn her brother into a puppy so she can take him to school and say , " hey everybody here 's my puppy brother			1
i thought , let 's do our own version ! what 's that expression about best laid plans ? i quickly learned i did a better job questioning presidents during my @entity48 days			2
always wanting to be prepared , i had questions ready : " what are you excited about kindergarten ? " " who 's in charge at kindergarten ? " " what do you hope to do in kindergarten ? " but the kids , five of whom attended @entity61 in @entity62 , the same nursery school as my daughters , had other ideas			1
and so , i quickly transitioned from reporter to mom and thought , " let 's play ' @entity68			0
' " everything seemed to be going along swimmingly until one of the children turned my idea on its head , as you 'll see in the video above			1
think of it as an orchestrated coup right there in my living room			0
opinion : my view : @entity82 redshirting different for each child how could i possibly expect kids to sit around talking with me when there were @entity86 in the playroom and a " @entity88 and the @entity89 " ship and a soccer game ? you get the idea ! the interview was n't a total disaster			1
we did squeak out a few nuggets on what they hope to do in kindergarten ( learn to read and , oh , ride a rainbow pony ! ) , who 's in charge in kindergarten ( they thought that was the most obvious question of them all ! ) and how they simply do n't know -- just yet -- what they want to be when they grow up			2
after all , they have plenty of time			0
what did i learn ? next time , never let the kids take over " @entity68			2
" follow @entity116 on @entity117 and like @entity118 on @entity119			0

@entity82 is a major *milestone* for any girl or *boy*
we tried to interview six kids about to enter kindergarten
the interview turned out to be harder than questioning a head of state
