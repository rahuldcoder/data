-- the @entity2 volcano producing the ash cloud snarling much of @entity5 air traffic has not stopped erupting			0
is there any chance that flight schedules could return to normal any time soon , and does the weather forecast provide any relief ? here are some common questions and answers about the ash cloud crisis			2
q : for how long will the volcanic cloud remain in the atmosphere ? a : the very fine ash previously injected into higher levels of the atmosphere -- above 20,000 feet -- will remain in the air for " quite some time , " because the particles can be removed only by thunderstorms , which are not expected in the next few days , the @entity17 said tuesday			1
the current high pressure system , with weak winds and slowly descending air in the center , is not helping to disperse the ash cloud , the @entity17 said			1
still , the ash particles are slowly descending to lower levels , and there is evidence that most of the ash is now between the ground and about 10,000 feet , the @entity17 said			2
q : what does the weather forecast say ? a : the current high - pressure system over @entity2 is expected to dissipate toward the end of the week , when a stronger low - pressure system is predicted to develop , the @entity17 said			1
not only will this system change the winds and push the ash toward the @entity44 , but the rains associated with this system will help " wash out " the ash at lower levels , the @entity17 said			1
while that directly affects only the ash in @entity2 , it could be good news for the rest of @entity5 , because some of the ash could be " washed out " of the air before it reaches the continent , said @entity0 weather anchor @entity57			0
for @entity59 and the @entity60 , upper - level winds coming from the north are not predicted to change any time soon			1
any rain that does develop closer to @entity5 would be unlikely to help wash much of the ash out of the atmosphere , @entity62 said , because the ash cloud has generally remained above any weather system			1
the ash currently being spewed out by the volcano is reaching as high as 20,000 feet			0
q : if the weather is n't going to change , when might the volcano stop erupting ? a : the eruption will continue for a while , but the activity will become less and less explosive , said volcanologist @entity76 of @entity77			1
the more important question is how long the volcano will continue to send ash high into the atmosphere			2
" with the first phases , the ash was going up to 30,000 to 40,000 feet , " @entity76 said			0
" the current levels that the ash is being ejected to is maybe only 10,000 or 20,000 feet			0
it 's probably also coarser - grained ash as well -- it 's not quite so finely divided on the whole -- so it 's going to settle out faster			2
so although the eruption may continue for a long time , and we may over the next few months see bursts of explosive activity , it 's probably not going to be as much of a problem as it has been during this last week			1
" q : does the appearance of the volcano 's plume indicate anything about the ash ? a : the whiteness of the plume suggests it contains mainly steam and little ash , the @entity17 said			0
when under - glacier eruptions occur , like this one in @entity2 , the volcanoes tend to produce finer particles of ash , which stay in the air longer , @entity76 said			2
that 's because the melting ice shatters the magma , which contains the particles that eventually become ash			0
q : what do the ash particles look like ? a : the particles are extremely fine -- about as fine as pollen , @entity76 said			1
they are made up of rocks , minerals , and volcanic glass , which together form volcanic ash , the @entity17 said			0
such ash is hard , does not dissolve in water , and is extremely abrasive and mildly corrosive , the @entity17 said			1
q : @entity2 has many volcanoes , so why has n't this situation happened before ? a : the last time an @entity2 volcano produced so much ash over @entity5 was in 1947 , when the @entity131 volcano erupted -- but that was when there were fewer planes in the sky and the world was n't as dependent on air travel as it is now , @entity76 said			0
disruption to air travel as a result of volcanoes happens frequently in the @entity142 , along the @entity144 - to - @entity145 route , where four to five days a year ash levels force flights to be diverted , @entity76 said			0
but airlines can more easily divert their routes there than they can in @entity5 .			0

*meteorologists* : very fine ash in upper atmosphere will remain for " quite some time "
low - pressure system expected to push ash toward the @entity44 , bring rain
volcanologist : activity will become less and less explosive over time
@entity164 particles are as fine as pollen , but hard , abrasive and mildly corrosive
