-- for much of the world , february 14 is known as a day to celebrate love			0
but in @entity4 , @entity3 has come to mark another occasion as well — the anniversary of the house arrest of @entity4 's leading opposition figures @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
on february 14 , 2011 , @entity4 authorities placed @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 under house arrest for calling on @entity4 to demonstrate in support of the popular @entity16 uprisings across the region			1
according to @entity18 , earlier this month @entity10 was moved from a @entity20 - controlled safe house to his own home			0
the transfer shined new light on the plight of @entity4 's " prisoners of rights " — those imprisoned for seeking to exercise commonly recognized political , social , religious , economic , and cultural rights , denied to them by the @entity4 government			1
in addition to opposition politicians like @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity4 's prisoners of rights include lawyers , journalists , professors , students , labor union workers , poets , musicians , artists , dissident clerics , bloggers , ethnic and religious minorities , @entity46 persons and even humanitarian aid workers			1
civil rights and human rights activists are also a primary target			2
some prisoners of rights , like women 's rights and student activist @entity54 , have been arrested for holding gatherings to protest laws that discriminate against women			2
others , like the " @entity59 " — the seven leaders of the @entity62 religious minority in @entity4 — are imprisoned for teaching a faith the @entity4 government does not recognize			2
still others , like lawyer @entity65 , are imprisoned for their efforts to assist or seek justice for prisoners of rights			2
ironically , before his arrest , @entity65 had been preparing a case in defense of the seven @entity62 leaders			0
the easing of restrictions on @entity10 's house arrest will be of key interest to observers tracking president @entity80 's delivery on promises he made on the campaign trail in last june 's presidential election			1
while @entity80 made no express promise to free @entity4 's prisoners of rights , his references to the jailed opposition leaders and pledge to increase civil and cultural freedoms resonated strongly with voters			1
the release of renowned human rights lawyer @entity92 and other high profile activists last september in advance of president @entity80 's first - ever address to the @entity95 buoyed hopes of more releases			1
and a subsequent announcement by the @entity4 judiciary that 80 more political prisoners had been pardoned further stoked expectations			2
unfortunately , these hopes have gone largely unrealized			1
according to human rights groups , only half of the 80 promised pardons can be confirmed			0
many of those released had already served their terms			0
since the announcement , arrests have continued — including the arrest of a popular rapper and more than a dozen " cyberactivists			0
" there is some indication that @entity4 's @entity117 may be driving human rights abuses during president @entity80 's first six months in office — perhaps in an effort to undermine reforms			1
indeed , while significant gains have been made through international diplomacy on the nuclear issue during president @entity80 's tenure , advancement on human rights has come to a standstill			1
this despite a recent poll that shows democracy , civil rights and women 's rights top the list of priorities for the @entity4 people			1
regardless of whom in @entity4 's complicated governance structure is at fault , one thing is clear : the international community 's engagement on human rights , alongside resolution of the nuclear issue and the easing of sanctions , remains a necessary factor for progress			1
each visit to @entity153 , each promise of renewed investment , each round of nuclear negotiations brings a fresh opportunity for global decision makers and influencers to press human rights concerns			0
these openings should not be squandered			0
another opportunity will present itself when the @entity163 powers reconvene in @entity164 this month			0
although by definition the focus of the talks will remain on the nuclear issue , geo - strategic concerns will likely be raised			0
alongside those concerns , every effort should be made to incorporate discussion of @entity4 's human rights situation into the conversation			1
finally , all of these governments will convene again in march for the @entity177 's 25th session in @entity178			0
they should take the opportunity to recommit themselves to the human rights cause by adopting a resolution renewing the mandate of the @entity184 on the situation of human rights in @entity4 and allowing him to visit the country			2
the resolution should also set specific benchmarks for the @entity4 government including the release of all prisoners of conscience , a moratorium on executions , and an end to restrictions on assembly , association , and expression			2
recently developed bilateral and multilateral channels between @entity4 and global powers , including the @entity203 , its member states , and @entity205 , should be used to advance these human rights goals			2
a few days ago another anniversary passed -- the 35th anniversary of @entity4 's 1979 revolution			1
back then the international community 's support of the @entity212 was also premised on long term diplomatic security and stability while paying short shrift to the leadership 's human rights abuses			0
the @entity4 people did not forget this			0
making the same mistake again is not only wrong , it is surely unwise			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			0
