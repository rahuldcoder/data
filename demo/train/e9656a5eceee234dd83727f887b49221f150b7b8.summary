-- in 1909 , @entity1 blazed a path across @entity4 's landscape and society			1
millions of women have followed in her tracks , few more precisely than @entity8 exactly 100 years later			1
@entity9 was the lead driver in a re-enactment last summer of @entity11 's journey , when she became the first woman to drive an automobile from coast to coast			1
both women drove a 1909 @entity17 from @entity18 to @entity19 , @entity20 , but they traversed two very different @entity21			1
" it really was a tremendous effort by so many people to get us across the country , " @entity9 , an event planner from @entity22 , @entity23 , said			1
" it showed me the heart of @entity4 was open to us in a big way that i do n't think would normally be so open had we been in a modern - day vehicle			1
" antique car enthusiast @entity9 recruited his 34 - year - old daughter to drive the 1909 @entity17 he and two friends built from parts they scavenged from around the globe , and hand - fabricated when necessary			1
" it all came down to a lot of books and manuals and guessing and putting a puzzle back together again with no instructions , " @entity8 said			2
they got the car built and running in time to launch the drive on june 9 at 1930 @entity47 , the address where @entity11 's journey began			1
several of @entity11 's descendants were on hand , including two who rode along for a few miles			2
@entity9 's @entity53 soon suffered the first of many breakdowns			1
" that was a bit defeating , especially since it was our first day and we were pretty jazzed and motivated to get moving and get on the road , " she said			0
temporary repairs carried the car and crew about 1,800 miles to western @entity65 , where a master mechanic worked for more than five hours to fix the problem in a more permanent way			0
" it was amazing to me that people would just stop their lives and do whatever they could to keep us moving , " @entity9 said			1
by @entity9 's side was @entity75 , her close friend and co-pilot			1
@entity75 described the co-pilot 's job as " navigation , waving , talking to people in the back seat ; i was also the blinker , the mirrors , comic relief ... " librarian - storyteller @entity86 rode in the back seat most of the way			1
" i love old cars , and i had read about @entity1 years ago			2
she 's one of my heroine - mentors , " said @entity89 , 67 , of @entity90 , @entity91			2
" ... my part was to dress up as @entity95 and tell her story			0
" the @entity53 's fourth seat was reserved for sponsors , dignitaries and special guests along the way , @entity9 said			1
when she was n't in the rear of the @entity53 , @entity89 was riding in the back seat of other antique cars that fell into formation along the way , forming what enthusiast @entity109 of @entity111 , @entity20 , called " a 3,000 - mile parade			1
" high - speed collisions with flying insects were a hallmark of the trip			2
" you do n't realize how valuable a windshield is until you ride in a car without a windshield , @entity89 quipped			0
" we were really acting as human windshields and bug - catchers , " @entity9 recalled			2
" a couple times a day we had a teeth - cleaning			2
" but at least the 2009 group had well - mapped , paved roads to travel on , part of the reason they were able to cross the country in 30 days , half the time it took @entity11 , who followed the general path of what would become the @entity134			2
" we traveled at a faster rate simply because we could , " @entity9 said			2
" @entity95 only had 152 miles of paved roadway in 1909 , and those roads were primarily within the cities			0
... otherwise it was all wagon trails , and that 's some difficult terrain to cross			0
" the social terrain was equally difficult			0
@entity11 " fit a category of woman in the early - 20th century , late - 19th century who was interested in quietly demonstrating that women were as capable as men in many of the things that had been considered manly pursuits , " said @entity142 , author of the book " @entity134 : @entity152			2
" the first cross-country drive by a man , @entity154 , had been accomplished just six years before @entity11 set out			0
" i can only imagine that the world said , ' here 's a woman with some gall			0
she can do this ; why ca n't other women ? ' " @entity142 said			0
" and , of course , a lot of women did hit the road			0
" @entity11 overcame sexism , but she did n't have to contend with huge tractor - trailers passing at 70 mph , kicking up debris and creating a gale - force draft around the open car			1
" i learned to turn my head when trucks go by so the sand would n't hit you too hard , " @entity89 recalled			0
@entity9 's @entity53 drove the final thousand miles with no first gear , which made crossing mountain ranges challenging			1
" hopefully you have a long downhill before the uphill so you can kind of take a big run at it , " she said			0
" and that 's what we would do , just kind of gun it and try to go as fast as we could up the hill			0
" the expedition 's triumphal moment was the crossing of the @entity193 into @entity19 -- something @entity11 could n't have done in 1909 because the bridge would n't be built for another 28 years			1
" the toll booth operator came out with her @entity197 to take our picture , " @entity89 said			0
the entire journey was filmed by @entity8 's brother @entity201 , a professional filmmaker in @entity18			1
a documentary is slated for release in 2010			0
the tour ended with champagne at a picturesque park			0
" i would just encourage everyone to slow down and take some of the back roads and enjoy the @entity134 and all these different highways i did n't know existed until i was fortunate enough to be a part of this drive , " @entity75 said			0
half of the fun is the journey			0
