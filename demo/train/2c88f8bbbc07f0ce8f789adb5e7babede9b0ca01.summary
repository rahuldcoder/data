-- @entity2 president @entity1 has admitted that he did know about alleged bribe payments made to former @entity2 executives , but insists he did n't think they were illegal at the time			1
" you ca n't judge the past on the basis of today 's standards			0
otherwise it would end up with moral justice			0
i ca n't have known about an offense that was n't even one , " he told the website of football 's world governing body			2
a @entity21 court has published its findings following an investigation into alleged illegal payments made by @entity2 marketing partner @entity25 ( @entity25 ) to former @entity2 president @entity26 and former executive committee member @entity27			1
the report found that @entity26 had received at least 1.5 million @entity21 francs ( $ 1.53 million ) and @entity27 was paid at least chf 12.4 million ( $ 12.64 million ) from marketing partner @entity25			2
@entity1 was @entity2 's general secretary at the time of the alleged irregularities , and in that role he co-signed agreements with the marketing group			1
@entity1 has confirmed that he is the " @entity38 " character investigators referred to in several key points of the report			2
the investigators specifically identified " @entity42 " as someone who knew about the illegal payments			2
" it was confirmed by the former chief financial officer of @entity2 ... that a certain payment made to @entity26 by the @entity46 amounting to chf 1 million was mistakenly directly transferred to a @entity2 account ; not only the cfo had knowledge of this , but also , among others , @entity38 would also have known about it , " the report stated			0
however , @entity1 defended his involvement on the @entity2 website in a move that shows the 76 - year - old is making some effort to keep the promises of greater transparency he made after being re-elected in 2011			1
" back then , such payments could even be deducted as a business expense , " he said of @entity25 's transactions , which were made between 1999 and the company 's collapse in 2001			0
" today , that would be punishable under law			0
" however , one of @entity2 's critics insists that @entity1 should take more responsibility for the ruling body 's actions			1
" the @entity2 president has a serious moral compass problem			1
you are looking at an organization whose culture is tolerant of impropriety , " @entity75 , co-director of campaign group @entity2 , told @entity0			0
" the president is trying to defend acts that would not be tolerated anywhere else			0
" @entity2 has been keen to point to its active involvement in the case , declaring on wednesday in a response to the document 's publication : " the decision by the @entity90 is in line with what @entity2 and the @entity92 president have been advocating since 2011 , when world football 's governing body announced its commitment to the publication of the @entity25 non-prosecution order			1
" @entity1 highlighted the formation of an @entity100 , an adjudicatory body and an investigatory body , and told the @entity2 website that " some important steps have already been taken			1
" however , @entity75 described @entity2 as " the least qualified people to investigate " the allegations against it .			0
