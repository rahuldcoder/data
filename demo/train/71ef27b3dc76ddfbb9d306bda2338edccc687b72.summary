-- @entity1 revealed that he will take time to learn about @entity3 before deciding to make any major changes , as he was unveiled as the @entity7 club 's new coach on monday			1
the 47 - year - old has signed a four - year contract just two weeks after leading @entity10 to success in the @entity13 final , sealing an unprecedented treble for the @entity16 club in his second season at the @entity18			1
@entity3 paid a reported $ 10 million compensation to @entity10 to secure his services after ending @entity23 coach @entity22 's only season in charge , which ended without a trophy despite a massive spending spree on the likes of @entity28 and @entity29			1
@entity1 , who spoke in @entity7 , @entity30 and his native @entity31 to the assembled media throng , said it was too early to predict wholesale changes to the star - studded squad			1
" i believe it 's time to analyze the situation , to get to know my club , ask lots of questions and get answers , " he said			1
" i need to realize the direction of my work			0
the most important thing is not the coach or the players but the club			1
we are too small compared to the dimension of the club			2
" if we work as a group , it 's not difficult to get results			2
i want this group to have an identity , to win everything			0
the strength of my team is always the team and not the individuals			0
" the club is happy with the roster of last season and so am i. we do n't need major changes			1
" we need three or four players for the coach to have more possibilities to get closer to my ideal of a team			1
but i do n't think it 's going to be a summer with a lot of changes			0
i think it will be a more calm summer with all the focus on the @entity74			0
" @entity1 said he was confident of a successful relationship with compatriot @entity28 , the world 's most expensive player following his $ 130 million transfer from @entity78 in july			1
" @entity28 is an incredible player not only for @entity3 but for the whole of football			2
@entity28 is a winner and it 's not difficult to persuade him of this , " he said			0
" i do n't know if i was born to coach @entity3 , but i was born to be a football coach			1
" i am @entity1 and i do n't change			2
i arrive with all my qualities and my defects			0
my attraction to @entity3 is due to its history , its frustrations in recent years and its expectations to win			2
" it 's a unique club and i believe that not to coach @entity3 leaves a void in a coach 's career			1
" @entity1 , who has now twice won @entity98 's premier club competition , said he was confident of completing his tenure at the @entity100 , where 10 managers have departed in the past 10 seasons			1
" i think a coach needs to be ready to be sacked			0
but if a coach fears that , he does n't work well and has great problems , " he said			0
" i am a coach that has a lot of self - esteem and confidence , and i do n't think about the possibility of being sacked			2
i think four years of contract is enough to win , to build a strong team for the present and the future			2
" the sacking of @entity22 does n't make me happy			0
i am never happy when a coach is sacked			0
but football is like that			0
" i have a lot of confidence in my players , i have the hope that my new players have confidence in me			0
