-- there are a myriad of options and over 50 years of heritage to tackle in the unenviable quest to isolate the greatest @entity7 scene of all time			1
six actors have played @entity11 's silver - tongued spy who thrives in a world crawling with agents , double agents , assassins and femme fatales			0
over the course of 23 films , that have grossed over $ 6 billion , there have been a litany of memorable set pieces as @entity7 pitches battle against maniacal villains , hell bent on world domination			0
despite this wealth of choice , a series of @entity7 experts , and one of the film 's legendary producers , are in no doubt as to which scene should be anointed the best ever			1
and given the recurring role that skiing has played throughout the life of @entity7 , it should comes as no surprise our panel 's chosen encounter occurs on the slopes			1
" i would argue the most iconic sequence is in ' @entity47 ' , when @entity7 shot straight off the edge of a cliff at @entity50 in @entity51 , " @entity44 , editor of the @entity45 , told @entity0			1
" we saw him fall and fall , and when the @entity55 parachute opened up and the theme tune kicked in , the world cheered			1
" that was @entity11 's @entity59 's @entity58 in 1977 and i think to this day it was ( famous @entity7 producer ) @entity63 's favorite ever scene in a @entity7 movie			1
" when everything cleared it was him , on his own against the world			0
you play that sequence around the world and it is @entity7			2
and he did it on skis			0
" screen icon the opening scene in any @entity7 film is a guaranteed thrill ride , but the beginning of " @entity47 , " the tenth film in the franchise , is still hard to top even in today 's world of daredevil stunts and breathtaking computer - generated imagery			1
it also encapsulates the qualities that make @entity7 such an enduring screen icon			0
the international man of mystery leaves a love interest in a remote log cabin up in the @entity92 after a message is sent to his new - fangled watch telling him to patch in to @entity95			0
@entity7 then outwits a series of gun - wielding @entity98 henchmen , before soaring off a cliff on his skis , plunging thousands of feet in the air before releasing his parachute , bedecked in the colors of the @entity55			1
@entity105 has a @entity7 pedigree almost as impressive as either @entity107 or @entity108			1
his legacy stretches over half a century , working first as a stuntman , then a stunt co-ordinator			1
and even though he has been involved in , and devised , some of its finest sequences , he agrees the best stunt ever features in one of the few films he did n't work on			0
" for me the greatest stunt is when @entity7 skis off the cliff with the @entity55 parachute , to me that is sensational , " he told @entity0			1
" i saw that and the whole cinema erupted			0
i thought that was the most fantastic opening ever -- just brilliant			0
" lone wolf " @entity47 " is not the only iconic scene to see @entity7 shaken and stirred on the slopes			1
@entity128 , author of the original @entity7 novels , passed his love for skiing on to his subject , and it has made regular appearances in some of 23 films that have followed since " @entity136 " showcased @entity134 as the dashing agent in 1962			2
" for your eyes only " includes a daring ski chase in which @entity108 's @entity7 escapes his pursuers by zipping down a bobsleigh run while @entity141 , in his only appearance as 007 , even manages to evade capture in a downhill chase despite being down to one ski in " @entity59 's @entity145			1
" @entity148 's @entity7 in " @entity149 " swept down a mountain slope on a cello case to escape danger while @entity153 battled grenade - throwing baddies on skidoo 's in " @entity156			2
" given that skiing is a high - octane preserve of the lone wolf , often associated with glamorous and sophisticated circles , it is inconceivable @entity11 's premier spy would be be at a loss on the slopes			0
" the generation of people who inspired the generation @entity128 was in all divided their time between skiing , mountain climbing , writing poems and fighting in the @entity173 , " said comedian and @entity7 enthusiast @entity165			2
" @entity7 has got the skills written into his hard drive because he 's @entity11			2
he can drive cranes , cars , submarines , why would n't he be able to drive two sticks ? " if you are going to live the high life you 've got to ski			0
it 's action packed , it 's classy , it 's quintessential @entity7			2
" thrill seeker as well as skiing , the other sports @entity7 pursues are also individual ones -- 007 is as unlikely to be found participating in team sports as the dry martini loving spy would be propping up the bar of a @entity11 pub drinking pints of ale			1
" @entity7 plays golf , bond scuba dives and he skis ; those are his three sports of choice , " said @entity44			2
" they are all individual , they are not team games , they are slightly glamorous , and not something you can do on your local pitch			0
skiing captures the danger , the thrill that @entity7 would push himself through			0
" so when will we next see current @entity213 strap on a pair of skis and take to the slopes ? " it is inevitable skiing will return , " @entity44 says			0
" let 's face it , @entity213 would look great on skis			0

opening sequence in " @entity47 " arguably the greatest @entity7 scene ever
@entity108 's 007 skis off a cliff and falls thousands of feet before opening a @entity55 parachute
scene *underlines* the *important* role skiing plays in the ever *popular* movie franchise
