@entity1 champions @entity0 have rejected a bid for striker @entity3 from rivals @entity4			1
the @entity6 club revealed in a statement released wednesday that it has submitted a " written offer " for the unsettled striker			1
" @entity4 can confirm that yesterday it made a written offer to @entity0 for the transfer of @entity3 , " the @entity4 statement read			1
the fee is not known , but reports in the @entity16 media on wednesday speculated that @entity4 might be offering winger @entity17 or defender @entity18 plus cash in the return for the services of @entity3			1
but the club flatly reject the claim			0
" although the terms of the offer are confidential , for avoidance of doubt and contrary to what is currently being briefed to the press in @entity32 ( where @entity0 are currently on tour ) , the proposed purchase price does not include the transfer or loan of any players from @entity4 to @entity0 , " the @entity4 statement read			1
@entity0 have not commented further on the bid			2
after overseeing his first game back in charge of @entity4 in @entity41 , @entity38 described the offer as " clean " and " ethical " before adding that the club have not , and will not , bid for any other strikers this summer			1
" we love the player , we are interested in the player , we made the bid			0
we have nothing more to say and nothing more to do			0
and now we have to respect and be ethical in this process , " @entity38 said following @entity4 's 1 - 0 win over @entity51			1
@entity4 's interest in @entity3 is the latest twist in a long - running saga about the striker 's future			1
rumors of the 27 - year - old 's discontent began to surface towards the end of last season as @entity0 were romping to a 20th @entity1 title			2
the club eventually won by 11 points from rivals @entity65 , but @entity3 was playing second fiddle to striker @entity67 who signed from @entity68 at the beginning of the 2012/13 season			1
the @entity71 netted 30 goals in 48 matches for his new club while @entity3 only managed 12 from 37			2
at the end of last season , outgoing manager @entity75 confirmed that @entity3 had submitted a transfer request			2
he should go away and think it over			0
he 's not happy being taken off a couple of times this season , but @entity3 in top form would n't have been taken off , " @entity75 said following @entity0 's final home game of the season			1
@entity75 's replacement , @entity86 tried to quash ongoing rumors when he officially took over the managerial reigns at the club earlier this month			0
" @entity3 is not for sale , " @entity86 , who signed a six - year contract to replace @entity75 in may , told reporters			0
" he is a @entity0 player and will remain a @entity0 player			0
" i see a glint in his eye			0
he looks happy , he looks like he will knuckle down and get himself right			0
" that apparent glint has been replaced by a furrowed brow with @entity3 reported to be " angry and confused " at his treatment by his current employers			1
the striker , who joined @entity0 from @entity86 ' previous club @entity104 for $ 39 million in 2004 , signed a new improved five - year - deal in october 2010 following a similar falling out with the club 's management			2
@entity0 's chief executive , @entity108 recently said that no contract renewals are currently being discussed			0
" i am not sitting down with any player on an extension and there is no trigger date in the diary			0
would we be afraid to run a contract down ? of course not , " @entity108 said .			0
