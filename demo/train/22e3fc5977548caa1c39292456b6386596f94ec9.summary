-- more than 2,800 people have been killed in @entity2 since the @entity4 crisis in @entity2 started in 2009 , according to @entity5			1
the @entity7 militant group , which wants to enforce a strict version of @entity7 law in northern @entity2 , has successfully hit soft and hard targets in a manner that questions the capacity of the @entity2 state to protect its citizenry			1
hard targets have included the police and @entity18 headquarters in @entity19			0
frustrated by his inability to solve the problem by peaceful means , president @entity20 had to fall back on the provisions of @entity25 of the @entity2 @entity26			2
in may 2013 , he declared states of emergency in @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 in northeastern @entity2 -- three key flashpoint states that had been wracked by activities of @entity4 and its offshoot , @entity35			1
" we have taken robust steps to unravel and address the root causes of these crises , but it would appear that there is a systematic effort by insurgents and terrorists to destabilize the @entity2 state and test our collective resolve , " @entity20 said in a televised speech			2

the @entity2 @entity56 provided air cover for the army and police , which raided the hideouts of the insurgents			2
the crackdown began to produce positive results in terms of a drastic reduction in attacks by the insurgents -- resulting from a blockade of their supply lines of fighters , arms and food			0
but how sustainable is all this ? can we say that the last of the @entity4 crisis has been heard ? the answer is a categorical no. read more : @entity2 president declares emergency in 3 states last weekend , gunmen stormed a school in @entity30 , killing 20 students and a teacher in an attack local media said had been claimed by @entity4			1
whereas the @entity2 government would say @entity4 members are being " flushed out " , an objective observer would say many are simply hibernating in various northern @entity2 communities			1
locals know who -- and where -- they are , but share two related grievances against the @entity2 state that is warring against the group			1
first and foremost , many northern @entity2 are unhappy with the way the military carries out its operations			2
in its pursuit of @entity4 , the @entity2 military views everything as a legitimate target -- including mosques , market places , women and children			1
the people regularly allege the killing of innocent people by the military			0
they claim to be more afraid of the soldiers than @entity4 insurgents			0
the @entity2 military recently told @entity5 that reports of civilian casualties during military raids were " grossly exaggerated , " but @entity120 secretary of state @entity119 has warned his @entity2 counterpart over alleged atrocities by soldiers			1
read more : gunmen kill 20 students , teacher in @entity2 school shooting the military can not claim to be winning under this kind of atmosphere			2
to get local support for a sustainable war against @entity4 , the military must invest more in winning the hearts and minds of the people			1
the alternative is that the people either become bystanders in the war or even supporters of @entity4			0
the second problem is that the north is not happy with the present regime in @entity2 , which has marginalized them politically , socially and economically since the 1999 transition from military to civil rule			2
the north had previously held the power in @entity2 ; it is now in the " opposition			0
" read more : @entity5 report on @entity2 violence the north took over from the @entity156 colonial masters when @entity2 became independent in 1960			0
these politicians were overthrown by the military in 1966 but once again the military leaders were northern dominated until they transferred power to civilians in 1999			0
since then , northerners ' grip on the @entity2 political system has been very weak ; it is getting weaker by the day			2
things are so bad for the north , that the possibility of it reclaiming political power in 2015 is becoming a mirage			0
if the political situation in @entity2 gets messier , the likes of @entity4 would fight for the north whether voluntarily or by invitation			1
for this reason , some northerners might not be too happy with the military suppressing @entity4			1
such individuals exist within the @entity2 military as well			2
this is why the chief of army staff lt. gen. @entity181 is constantly warning his men and officers not to sabotage the ongoing military operations by providing intelligence to the insurgents			0

a group whose bloodied hands were found in the 2000 to 2003 political violence in @entity29 ; a group that two years later emerged as the " @entity2 @entity200 " before becoming securitized by the @entity2 state as @entity4 ( meaning " western education is evil " ) can not be easily sent packing by the @entity2 military			1
@entity4 's members have seen many battles in the past and the group is known to be a cat with many lives			1
even if it died out , it would germinate in new forms			0
the needs of @entity4 are not even known to the @entity2 state not to mention being met by it			1
more problems should be expected			0
the group might emerge under new name now that it has been banned by the @entity156 and its present leadership has been declared wanted by the @entity120			0
read more : @entity2 ask , are we at war ? leader @entity217 and some of the group 's other senior members have nothing to gain from any permanent peace -- especially as the international community has already cast them in the mold of former @entity48 leader @entity224			1
as they await eventual capture , they will not mind causing more trouble			0
to sustain its recent gains , the military task force in the three states will need to take the character of a near permanent formation on the ground			0
if the military leave , @entity4 will quickly come in to fill the space			2
occasional sniper attacks on soft targets by the group will provide justification for the military to ask for money to keep the northeast safe			0
in other words , the @entity2 military is doing its best but the present situation is only a state of negative peace ; it is a peace of the graveyard			1
the committee on dialogue and peaceful resolution of security challenges in the north , set up by the federal government , claimed some days ago it has reached a ceasefire agreement with the @entity4 sect			0
such an agreement must have been reached with a significant faction of the sect			0
read more : why @entity2 's elections matter if not , where did the group meet the faction led by @entity217 and what were the terms of the agreement ? what is in the agreement for the @entity4 most especially on issues relating to strict enforcement of @entity7 laws in northern @entity2 ? what does it have to say on " amnesty " for @entity217 and other leaders of the sect ? the committee members are only trying to save face			1
the ongoing military operations against the @entity4 were launched few days after the committee was set up			2
the members are confused ; the credibility of their mission is questioned and they have to say something to @entity2 before running away			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of @entity287 .			0

@entity4 is an @entity7 militant group that wants to enforce a *slamic* law in @entity2
@entity2 's president has declared emergencies in three states where the group operates
@entity287 says the military 's *tactics* are not working and it is failing to win hearts and minds
many northerners share some of the group 's grievances against the state , he says
