-- when all is said and done , @entity1 is just a name on a book cover			1
sometimes her name is accompanied by the word " with , " or , in the case of one juicy memoir , the phrase " assisted by , edited by , and put into proper @entity10 by ... " @entity1 is a celebrity ghostwriter -- as crucial to the publishing process as paper and ink			1
" clearly i am not sitting there holding a pen with the [ celebrity ] , " said @entity1 , who has co-written autobiographies with @entity15 and @entity17 's brother @entity16			1
" it 's a very delicate relationship , " she said			2
" i 'm not there as an interrogator			2
... nothing will go in that book that they do n't want			2
but that 's not to say you 're not going to do quite a bit of coaxing and convincing			2
" @entity1 's latest , @entity31 's " @entity30 " is due out in 2011			2
@entity32 , the ceo of @entity33 , a @entity34 - based literary agency , said the reason celebrity memoirs are taking over bookshelves is simple : people buy them			1
more than 80 celebrity autobiographies have already been published this year			1
" when certain books do well , publishers want more of those books			1
these books have been doing really well : the @entity46 [ @entity47 ] and the @entity48 [ @entity49 ] and the @entity50 , " he said			1
and with the increased interest in celebrity memoirs comes a need for people who can help get the celebrity 's words down on paper			1
enter @entity1 , and a small circle of @entity60 ghostwriters			1
" sometimes celebrities will try to write a book themselves			1
... but because everything in their life seems important , you get to page 200 and they 're only 12 years old , " @entity32 said			2
" it 's difficult to sit there by yourself and remember your life because you 're in the center of it			2
" and not every star has the skill set or even the time to sit down and write an autobiography , said @entity76			1
and it 's not just memoirs			1
some celebrities employ ghostwriters to help bring their novels to life			1
but according to ghostwriter @entity84 , there is little appeal to co-writing someone 's novel			2
" the argument could be made that more people are going to read it or see it that way , but you 're just handing over the credit to someone else , " said @entity84 , who has co-authored memoirs with @entity49 and @entity89			1
" but a memoir is their life			2
they deserve the credit because they lived it			2
all i 'm doing is helping them put it on paper			0
" @entity84 said , despite being responsible to tell someone else 's life story , there 's little pressure involved			0
" it 's all about staying realistic , " he said			0
" if someone knows who they are ... and what their fan base is looking for , that 's really helpful			0
" but even with the most accommodating , self - aware subject , ghostwriting is not for everyone , @entity32 said			0
" you have to be sort of a shrink -- taking someone through their life , you need patience and put your own ego away because you 're not the boss			0
" as a ghostwriter , " you 're part psychoanalyst , part best friend , part lion tamer , part interviewer and part nanny , " @entity1 said			0
" you have to crack the whip now and again			0
" @entity1 recalls working with @entity15 , who went through co-authors like she went through husbands			1
@entity1 , the fifth and final writer to attempt @entity15 's memoir , ended up uncovering a long list of lovers @entity15 had previously chosen to keep under wraps -- simply by asking -- including a secret affair with @entity142			1
" i thought , ' well , she 's met all these people			0
... if i had met those people , who would i have had affairs with ? ' " @entity1 used the same techniques when helping @entity17 's younger brother @entity16 write his best - selling memoir , " life with my sister @entity17			1
" " i knew this was the most amazing topic			0
... you could feel @entity17 's breath on your face when he talked			0
" " we live in an age where there 's so much out there , " @entity1 said			0
" you 're very lucky if you have a scoop			0
" even so , there 's no guarantee that the scoop will end up in finished product , hence the aforementioned coaxing			1
" it 's the celebrity 's book , " @entity32 said			1
" you ca n't make someone put something in a book that they do n't want to put in it			0
they 're not on the witness stand			0
i 'm not saying they do n't tell the truth , but , sometimes , stories are told up to a certain point			0
" but @entity1 and @entity179 agree : it usually does n't take much to convince subjects to include salacious information			0
" they [ usually ] know it 's important and they just want to hear someone else remind them , " @entity84 said			0
@entity1 agreed : " it 's like an impressionist painting : little brush strokes			0
you do n't want to tread on any sensitivities , yet you do n't want to leave stones unturned			0
