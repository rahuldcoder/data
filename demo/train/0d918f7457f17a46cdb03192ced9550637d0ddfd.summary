@entity0 -- after six days , 3,250 booths and 20,000 new products , a few interesting trends bubbled up at last week 's @entity5			1
there were plenty of generic 5 - inch smartphones , cheap tablets and ginormous televisions , as well as prototypes of fun , futuristic technology like the 20 - inch 4k tablet from @entity15 or the self - driving car from @entity17			1
we also spotted plenty of odd gear , like the manicure machine that can print photos on your nails and the mind - controlled helicopter			2
and we learned a few things about where consumer tech is going in 2013			2
here are six trends that caught our eye			2
transportation for people who hate walking @entity35 , futuristic smart cars were on display from big companies such as @entity17 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
they showed off self - driving car prototypes and in - car displays for reading maps , playing music and even checking social networks			2
but some of the more inventive transportation tech was smaller and geekier			2
there was the @entity49 , a motorized skateboard that senses your weight to propel you in the right direction , going up to 15 miles per hour			2
the @entity55 bike will set lazy bikers back $ 4,000			2
people wearing electric roller skates and strange two - wheeled boots zipped around the show floor at low speeds			1
the @entity63 electric unicycle actually looked like a lot of fun , but at $ 1,795 , you might be better off catching a few cabs			2
overhyped pricey tvs televisions are the biggest product category at the @entity5 , with major companies such as @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity15 using the occasion to launch their latest and greatest screens			1
the big hardware feature pushed at last week 's show was the @entity80 screen , which offers a crisper picture than traditional hd displays			1
while the technology is closer to being available to consumers , it 's still mostly just hype			1
the prices are sky - high for @entity87 , and you 'll notice the difference only if you 're sitting close to the set or if you spring for a giant television measuring 60 inches or larger			0
even if you can afford a @entity94 , there 's not much in the way of content for the medium yet			0
crowdfunded gadgets the crowd - funding and conference worlds merged nicely at this year 's ces			1
companies that got their start on @entity104 or @entity105 , like the people who made the @entity108 smart watch , managed to parlay that early momentum into higher visibility at the show			1
crowdfunding sites also are proving to be more than just great ways to raise money ; they 're places where people with offbeat inventions can test the waters to see whether there 's a market for their product			0
and then there were the startups with protoypes that announced plans to raise money on crowdfunding sites in the coming months			0
one @entity5 darling was the @entity129 , a " smart " fork that tallies how many bites you take in order to help fast eaters slow down			1
the product has received a lot of press , both adoring and mocking , which should help it rake in money when it debuts on @entity104 this spring			1
help for senior citizens the elderly tend to get overlooked in the tech world , but this year 's @entity5 featured a surprising number of products aimed at the grandparent set			1
connected smart - home devices make it possible to monitor family members from far away , which can be comforting to primary caregivers dealing with aging parents			0
new sensors can text family members or a doctor if something is amiss in the senior 's daily routine , such as not getting out of bed or skipping medication			0
if you 're concerned about an elderly relative 's safety , you can use smartphone apps to remotely control security systems , thermostats and even kitchen electronics			0
for people in poor health , sensors and gadgets will monitor vital signs and send alerts if someone needs assistance right away			0
in case of emergency whether inspired by @entity174 or " @entity175 , " a number of intriguing gadgets promised to help users handle emergencies			1
the @entity182 inflatable lantern , for example , is both solar - powered and waterproof			0
also popular were mobile - charging devices that offer backup power on the go for smartphones and tablets			0
these battery packs can be pricey , though			0
the solar - powered @entity190 generator has enough juice to power a smartphone for 15 hours , but it will cost you $ 400			0
the junk @entity5 is huge , spanning 1.92 million square feet			1
for every interesting gadget or prototype , there were dozens of small booths hawking digital detritus			0
though @entity202 does n't have an official presence at @entity5 , the @entity201 accessory was a popular item on the show floor , there was a neverending supply of cheap cases , covers , @entity210 keyboards , power packs and charging stations for @entity201 and @entity213			1
speakers and headphones were as omnipresent as flu germs			0
some big companies introduced cool audio products , but the big trend continued to be celebrity - endorsed headphones			1
beats by @entity222 has done so well that every earbud now clamors for some famous support , even from the likes of @entity227 rhead frontman @entity226 or , um , " the @entity229 's " @entity228			0
finally , there were the massagers			0
there was n't anything terribly innovative or new in the massage field , but the booths demoing massage tech were always packed with stressed - out or weary attendees who needed a little back rub after wandering the show floor all day			1
the latest trend in this field ? little robot massagers that wander around on your back			0
we 'll find out soon enough whether they catch on in the real world .			0
