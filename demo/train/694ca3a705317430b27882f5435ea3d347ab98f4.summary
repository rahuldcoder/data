-- many have criticized the body mass index , or @entity3 , as being a poor indicator of obesity and of obesity - related health risks			1
critics say @entity3 is too simple to be accurate , that it does n't take into account a person 's muscle mass or where the body fat is located			1
@entity13 , therefore , may be tempted to brush off the easy - to - access statistic -- and the possible need for lifestyle changes -- if they do n't like their results			0
alternative methods such as waist - to - height ratios or body composition testing may be more accurate in measuring an individual 's body fat percentage			2
but @entity3 is just as good at providing information about your health risks and can be easily , reliably and cheaply used by clinicians and patients to provide a useful snapshot of how someone 's weight compares to healthy standards			1
your @entity3 can be calculated online with a simple formula : weight in kilograms divided by height in centimeters squared			2
in pounds and inches this formula becomes weight in pounds divided by height in inches squared , multiplied by 703 to account for the metric conversion			0
a @entity3 between 18.5 and 24.9 indicates a normal weight ; a @entity3 between 25 and 29.9 indicates a person is overweight ; and a @entity3 of 30 or above indicates obesity			1
there are always exceptions to any rule , but when it comes to predicting obesity - related health risks , @entity3 is among the strongest predictors , regardless of what critics say			1
@entity50 , most obese @entity13 city , moving from fat to fit even when compared with other measures such as waist circumference , waist - to - height - ratio , percent body fat , fat mass index or fat - free mass index , the science shows that @entity3 is just as good at predicting obesity - related health risks			1
my research team at the @entity63 examined cross-sectional measurements of height , weight , waist circumference , percent body fat , blood pressure measurements , cholesterol levels and fasting glucose levels for more than 12,000 adults using information from @entity75 's database of patients			2
the numbers showed that @entity3 is the strongest predictor of blood pressure , and the measurement is comparable to other measurements at predicting cholesterol levels			0
@entity3 also performed admirably against other measures in predicting fasting glucose levels , which are an important part of diagnosing diabetes			0
it 's tempting to write off @entity3 as overly simplistic when it delivers news about our weight and health that we do n't like			1
but the bottom line is that it 's time to start using this easy - to - access measure and heed its warnings about your health			0
if your @entity3 is high , chances are good it 's because you have excess fat tissue , which means you 're at risk for other health problems , including heart disease related to high blood pressure or high cholesterol , and diabetes			1
instead of blindly rejecting @entity3 , more patients and doctors should be embracing it as a screening tool			0
individuals who know they have a high @entity3 should talk to their doctor about what they can do to get their weight into a healthy range			2
doctors should be confident in making lifestyle change recommendations based on an initial @entity3 measurement			0
by accepting reality , focusing on preventive care and heeding the warning signs of a dangerous weight , patients and doctors can work together to build healthy lifestyles , instead of treating the results of unhealthy ones			0
obesity rate may be worse than we think			0

doctor : body mass index is useful snapshot of how weight compares to healthy standards
a @entity3 between 18.5 and 24.9 indicates a normal weight
doctor 's study shows @entity3 is *helpful* in predicting obesity - related health risks
