the home side should have increased their advantage just before the break as @entity74 shot wide from an excellent position after a flowing home move			0
@entity68 crossed for @entity77 to score @entity9 's second on 50 minutes as he volleyed past @entity70			1
@entity77 should have notched a clinching third soon afterwards as his fierce shot from a @entity81 cutback was brilliantly turned away by @entity70			2
@entity82 star @entity81 lasted just over an hour after an injury layoff before being replaced by @entity84			0
