@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity2 's @entity3 had tough questions for @entity6 's political leader			1
@entity7 is known as @entity6 ' external deal - maker and a fund - raiser from supporters in the region , a role the 58 - year - old has held since 2004			1
@entity3 interviewed @entity7 over the weekend in @entity1 , where he lives			1
here are some highlights from the interview			0
firing rockets from neighborhoods @entity3 asked @entity7 why @entity6 is firing rockets from civilian neighborhoods			1
" how many @entity21 civilians have our rockets killed ? @entity21 knows the number			2
meanwhile , how many @entity25 has @entity21 killed ? up until now have been killed 1700 people , while we have killed 63 soldiers			0
we kill soldiers , while they kill civilians			2
" ( the @entity25 death toll as of monday was at least 1,856 , according to the @entity32			0
sixty - four @entity21 soldiers and three civilians in @entity21 had been killed , according to @entity21 officials			2
) @entity3 then asked @entity7 to respond to critics who say @entity6 is using civilian deaths to gain international sympathy			1
@entity7 called that a lie and said @entity6 is not seeking international sympathy through its own victims			1
" it is unfortunate that the @entity43 administration and president @entity44 have adopted the @entity21 narrative , which is a lie			0
@entity6 sacrifices itself for its people and does not use its people as human shields to protect its soldiers			1
the fighter , just like the soldier in the army , his job is to protect the people , and not to sacrifice the people for himself			0
" @entity6 ' cause @entity7 said @entity21 has a powerful military but the @entity25 will triumph			1
" we are stronger than they are in the justness of our cause			0
we are the rightful owners of the land , and they are the thieves of the land			0
we are the victims and they are the murderers			0
but despite this , we might not win a battle or two completely , but at the end we will win the war			2
our steadfastness is a victory			0
for us to kill their soldiers while they kill our civilians is also a victory for the @entity25 cause and @entity6			2
" @entity3 pressed @entity7 on the point , asking how this can be a victory for @entity6 and its cause when so many @entity25 are dying			1
" our people are convinced today that the only way to get rid of the occupation and establish their state is through resistance			2
" cease - fire @entity3 wanted to know whether @entity6 would ever accept @entity21 's right to exist and agree to a cease - fire			1
" we 're ready for a cease - fire			1
we want the war to end today , and we did not attack anyone			0
it was ( @entity21 prime minister benjamin ) netanyahu who transferred the crisis of what happened in the @entity96 to @entity97			2
he 's the one responsible for this			0
we 're ready to stop this war			0
" ( the killing of three @entity21 teenagers in the @entity96 triggered the current crisis			0
) @entity104 talks @entity6 has agreed to cease - fires through @entity104 mediators " many times " since 2003 , @entity7 said			1
" the @entity21 , the @entity104 and the @entity43 administration know ( this ) , otherwise @entity110 would not have intervened this time nor ( former secretary of state ) mrs. @entity112 in 2012			0
they know that @entity6 is very credible in that if its leadership promised something , it will fulfill its promise , and the fighters on the ground will follow that			2
" he said he is still willing to engage in talks with @entity104 acting as the go - betweens			0
" regardless what the others ' positions ( are ) , we stated that we are ready to go as a @entity25 delegation to @entity128 in order to talk to the @entity104 so they can hold indirect talks between us and the @entity21 , so we can reach an agreement that will address our @entity25 demands , headed by ending the siege of @entity97			2
then cease - fire can take place			1
we announced this position before and we are still committed to it			0
" peace negotiations @entity6 is not to blame for the lack of a solution , he said			2
" we the @entity25 people have , since 1948 , have listened to the international community and @entity147 and international regulations , in the hope they end the aggression against us			0
but the international community failed in ending the @entity21 occupation and failed in helping our people to have self - determination and have its own state			0
even the latest ( peace ) negotiations , between ( @entity156 and @entity157 with @entity110 as the broker , were sabotaged by @entity157			0
" calls for cease - fires @entity7 said he would support a temporary cease - fire for humanitarian purposes			1
but he would only support a long - term cease - fire if @entity21 changes its policy restricting the movement of goods and people into @entity97			1
" there are two kinds of cease - fires : there is the humanitarian cease - fire , like 72 - hour cease - fire that was meant to help and aid our people getting food , water , and help collecting the bodies			1
as far as the sustainable cease - fire , this is connected to an agreement accepted by the two parties that will guarantee our @entity25 demands headed by lifting the siege on @entity97			1
" what is @entity6 ' endgame in @entity97 ? @entity2 's @entity187 contributed to this report .			1
