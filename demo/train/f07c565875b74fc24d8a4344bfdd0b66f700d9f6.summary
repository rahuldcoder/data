another top @entity1 official weighed in wednesday about the tensions brewing between his country and the @entity4 , the latest salvo in the war of words over the @entity8 and the @entity9			1
" we have always stated that there is no need for the forces belonging to the countries beyond this region to have a presence in the @entity9 , " brig			2
gen. @entity19 said wednesday , the semiofficial @entity18 reported			0
" their presence does nothing but create mayhem , and we never wanted them to be present in the @entity9			0
" his statement is the latest rhetoric stemming from @entity1 's threat last week to close the strategically important @entity8			1
the strait , the only outlet from the @entity9 , is a critical shipping lane , with 17 million barrels of oil per day passing through in 2011 , according to the @entity4 @entity33			1
@entity1 threatened to block the strait if sanctions were imposed on its oil exports			0
@entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 have proposed sanctions to punish @entity1 's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program			1
@entity44 , spokeswoman for the @entity4 @entity45 based in @entity46 , responded at the time , " anyone who threatens to disrupt freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the community of nations ; any disruption will not be tolerated			0
" answering a reporter 's question wednesday about the closing of the strait , @entity19 said , " the security of the @entity8 is one of the issues that @entity1 is concerned with , and the @entity60 has been maintaining this security			1
" he emphasized that @entity1 is a regional power and will always protect the strait			0
" of course the enemies try to exaggerate this issue in order to secure weapons sales to the countries of this region , " he said			0
@entity19 said a number of observers from other countries had been present during @entity1 's recent military exercises in and around the strait , and suggested that @entity1 could hold joint maneuvers with neighboring countries , @entity68 said			2
@entity1 warned the @entity4 on tuesday not to return a @entity4 aircraft carrier group " to the @entity9			1
" maj. gen. @entity77 , commander of @entity1 's army , said his country " will not adopt any irrational move , but it is ready to severely react against any threat , " the @entity76 said			2
@entity4 officials rejected the warning			0
the commander spoke at the @entity86 in southern @entity1 , as forces held a military parade the day after @entity1 ended naval drills in the region , @entity76 reported			0
the @entity91 , part of the @entity94 's fleet in the region , moved last week from the @entity9 into the @entity96 as part of what the 5th @entity45 called a preplanned transit			0
@entity1 said the ship 's movement in relation to @entity1 's naval exercises showed that the @entity4 " understood " that @entity1 's maneuvers were not " suicidal or aggressive , " but rather about @entity1 protecting its own " interests and power			1
" but @entity108 diplomats last week described the naval drills -- which , according to @entity1 officials , included test - firing missiles -- as further evidence of @entity1 's volatile behavior			2
@entity1 's naval exercises began in the strait and also included waters in the @entity116 and the @entity117 up to the @entity118 , according to @entity76			2
after tuesday 's warning from @entity1 , a @entity120 spokesman issued a statement saying " deployment of @entity4 military assets in the @entity9 will continue as it has for decades			1
" the @entity4 has had forces in the @entity9 since @entity127 its ships sail through the @entity9 frequently , many on their way to and from the 5th @entity45 's headquarters in @entity46			1
the 5th @entity45 's area of responsibility covers about 2.5 million square miles , including the @entity9 , which the @entity94 also refers to as the @entity9 ; the @entity133 ; the @entity116 ; and parts of the @entity117 .			0
