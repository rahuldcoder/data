-- they 've earned admiration around the world for their on - court prowess , not to mention the enviable sum of more than $ 160 million in prize money between them			1
now the " @entity11 " of the men 's tennis world have helped negotiate a pay rise for their lower - ranked colleagues			2
@entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 have joined forces to convince @entity20 chiefs to increase the prize money for this year 's tournament to £ 16.1 million ( $ 25.9 million )			1
it 's a 10 % increase on last year 's £ 14.6 million ( $ 23.5 million ) total , representing the biggest rise in 19 years			1
the largest slice of the cash will go to players making an early exit in late june , with first - round singles losers to each scoop £ 14,500 ( $ 23,400 ) -- up 26.1 % on last year			1
the singles champions , meanwhile , will see their prize money rise by just 4.5 % , though this will still leave them with a tidy sum of £ 1.15 million ( $ 1.85 million ) each			1
@entity16 won the men 's title last year to become the new world no. 1 , while @entity39 will also be defending her title in @entity41			0
every round of the grass - court tournament will see increases , with those in the quarterfinals enjoying a rise of 5.5 % to £ 145,000 ( $ 233,720 )			2
the decision aims to quell growing grumblings within the sport over the amount of money being offered to lesser players who are failing to meet rising costs			0
those knocked out in the earlier rounds are increasingly struggling to cover travel costs or employ a regular coach , and there had been rumors of players preparing a strike in protest			0
however this was denied by chairman of the host @entity67 , @entity68			0
the @entity20 chief said the decision followed a meeting with the @entity11 at @entity72 last month			0
he insisted the issue of strikes was never discussed			0
" @entity20 continues to be successful and we are delighted to share that success with the players by increasing total prize money by 10 % , the largest increase since 1993 , " he said			1
" at the same time , we appreciate the need to help players meet the rising costs associated with professional tennis , so the majority of the record £ 1.5 million increase will be distributed to those who are knocked out in the early rounds of the championships			2
" @entity20 follows the lead of the @entity91 , which last month increased its overall prize purse by 7 % to $ 24.6 million			2
similarly , the biggest rise went to first - round losers , who picked up a 20 % boost -- a prize of $ 23,670			1
in comparison , singles champions at @entity91 scored an increase of 4.17 % , giving them total prizes of $ 1.64 million each			0
the pressure will now be on the two other grand slams to follow suit			0
growing unrest started at last year 's @entity106 , where @entity17 and @entity15 were particularly vocal about the uneven distribution of prize money			1
the @entity111 event 's singles champions earn $ 1.8 million and first - round knockouts get $ 19,000			2
at january 's @entity114 , title winners earned $ 2.37 million each , compared with $ 21,500 for players who lost at the first hurdle .			0
