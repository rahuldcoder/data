days after the @entity2 ' brutal defeat in the midterm elections , president @entity0 said sunday that he takes responsibility for his party 's poor performance at the polls			1
" the buck stops right here at my desk , " the president said in an interview on @entity10 ' @entity11			1
" and so whenever -- as the head of the party -- it does n't do well , i 've got to take responsibility for it			0
" ahead of the election , @entity0 's approval rating was at presidential low , with more than half of all @entity23 saying they disapproved of the job the president was doing and only 41 % saying they approved			1
vulnerable candidates in key battleground states made efforts to distance themselves from the commander - in - chief , with some publicly condemning his policies and others refusing his surrogacy on the campaign trail			0
reflecting on what he could have done differently and what he will change moving forward , @entity0 says he will work harder to become a better salesman			1
" i think that one thing that i do need to constantly remind myself and my team of is it 's not enough just to build a better mousetrap			0
people do n't automatically come beating to your door			0
we 've got to sell it , " @entity0 said			1
" we 've got to reach out to the other side and , where possible , persuade			0
" " i think that what you 'll see is a constant effort to improve the way we deliver service to customers ... experimenting with ways that i can reach out to republicans more effectively			0
making sure that we 're reaching out and using the private sector more effectively			2
" looking back , the president admits that he sometimes struggled to work politics into policy negotiations , a weakness that affected his ability to communicate his positions to members of the opposite party and to the @entity23 people			1
" i think there are times -- there 's no doubt about it -- where , you know , i think we have not been successful in going out there and letting people know what it is that we 're trying to do and why this is the right direction , " @entity0 said			1
" so there is a failure of politics there that we 've got to improve on			0
" it 's a somber moment for the former senator , who will lead his last two years in the @entity84 determining whether or not to veto or sign bills coming from a @entity87 - led @entity86			0
in retrospect , he now says he is learning to become a better legislator - in - chief			0
" one of the things we 're learning is that there 's a real power to being able to convene here in the @entity97			2
not every problem has to be solved just through a bill			0
just through legislation , " @entity0 said			1
the day following the midterms , the president addressed the country , saying he heard voters and their concerns through the polls			1
on sunday , he detailed what that meant			0
" the message that i took from this election , and we 've seen this in a number of elections , successive elections , is people want to see this city work , " @entity0 said			1
" they see @entity118 gridlocked and they 're frustrated			1
and they know one person in @entity118 and that 's the @entity123			1
" @entity0 is n't the first , and wo n't be the last , president to see his party get swept in the final midterm elections during a two - term presidency			1
but now after witnessing his final election from the @entity84 , he says that he 's realized " campaigning and governance are two different things			0
" " i 've ran two successful campaigns , " @entity0 said			1
" and anybody who 's seen me on the campaign trail can tell how much i love just being with the @entity23 people			0
and hearing what they care about and how passionate i am about trying to help them			0
" " when you start governing there is a tendency sometimes , for me , to start thinking , ' as long as i get the policy right , then that 's what should matter			2
' and people have asked , ' what do you need to do differently going forward ? ' and i think you do that gut check after every election			2
" in hindsight , @entity0 acknowledges that his critics were fair to condemn him for not trying hard enough to work with @entity87 , saying he could have pushed harder to negotiate and get things done			1
" i think that what is also true is that no matter how frustrating it can sometimes be for any president to deal with an opposition that is , you know , pretty stubborn and where there are really strong differences , you 've just got to keep on trying			2
" but one thing you can expect to see change -- according to the president -- in the next two years , is a shake - up at the @entity97			2
" we will be bringing in new folks here because people get tired , you know , it 's a hard job , " he said			2
" and what i 've told everybody is , you know , i want you to have as much enthusiasm and energy on the last day of this administration as you do right now or you did when you first started			0
otherwise you should n't be here			0
