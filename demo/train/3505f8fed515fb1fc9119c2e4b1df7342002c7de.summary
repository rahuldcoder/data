two deadly attacks in two days in the city of @entity2 have once again raised the specter of terrorism in @entity5 , just weeks before the country is due to hold the @entity7			1
at least 16 people were killed monday when an explosion hit a trolleybus during the morning rush hour			0
less than 24 hours earlier , a blast at @entity2 's main train station killed 18 people			1
authorities quickly labeled both acts terrorist attacks			0
and while no group immediately claimed responsibility , suspicion quickly fell on @entity21 separatist groups			1
one in particular , the @entity22 , has said it will expend " maximum force " in disrupting the @entity23 in @entity24			2
here 's a look at the ongoing conflict in @entity5 's @entity28 , at how the violence has spilled over into the rest of the country , and why @entity2 may have been targeted			1
second blast rocks @entity5 city q. who is behind the attack ? @entity38 that 's hard to say since no group has yet stepped forward			1
while the @entity22 has made incendiary statements vowing attacks , the explosions could be the work of any number of autonomous groups fighting in the @entity28			1
then again , they could also be the handiwork of another group altogether , one that has nothing to do with the conflict in the region			1
@entity35 why has suspicion fallen on the @entity22 ? @entity38 in july , @entity54 , the group 's leader , released a video statement in which he vowed to unleash " maximum force " to disrupt the games at @entity24			1
the @entity5 , he said , " plan to hold the @entity23 on the bones of our ancestors , on the bones of many , many dead @entity64 buried on the territory of our land on the @entity68 , and we @entity69 are obliged not to permit that -- using any methods allowed us by the almighty @entity71			1
" @entity35 why were @entity54 's threats taken seriously ? @entity73 is @entity5 's most - wanted man			1
the @entity74 , which considers the @entity22 a terrorist group , has a $ 5 million reward for information leading to him			0
the @entity74 said @entity54 organized a suicide bombing outside the @entity80 in may 2009			0
his group also claimed responsibility for the bombing of @entity84 in @entity85 in 2011 that killed 36 people , the 2010 bombings of the @entity85 subway that killed 40 people , and the 2009 bombing of the high - speed @entity91 in which 28 people died			1
@entity35 how did @entity5 authorities react ? a. @entity5 president @entity95 has maintained that the @entity7 games will be safe and security will be tight			2
visitors to @entity24 and the surrounding area are subjected to rigorous security checks , and vehicle license plates are monitored			0
@entity21 's leader , @entity102 , vowed that the threat @entity54 poses will be contained before the start of the games			1
i am certain that we will eliminate him before the @entity23 , " @entity102 said after @entity54 's statement			1
but the @entity2 attacks have laid bare the challenge in ensuring the safety throughout the massive country			2
@entity35 why was @entity2 targeted ? @entity114 reason could be because @entity2 is a major rail hub			2
if you are traveling from @entity85 or other parts of central @entity5 , you travel through @entity2 to get to @entity24			1
it 's also the rail station you travel through to get to and from the @entity28			1
opinion : attacks show @entity7 under grave threat q. what is the @entity28 region ? a. it 's a region that comprises the @entity5 republics of @entity21 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			1
and it 's a part of the world that 's no stranger to violence and terrorism			0
q. what is the source of the conflict ? a. the conflict dates back many years and has exacted a heavy toll on both sides			0
@entity143 have laid claim to land in the @entity147 region for more than 5,000 years			0
the standard of living in the republics is poor compared with the rest of @entity5			2
unemployment is rampant and infant mortality is high			0
in addition , the @entity21 population of about 1 million is mostly made up of @entity64 , who maintain a distinctly different cultural and linguistic identity from @entity156			2
in 1991 , @entity21 formally announced its fight for independence , saying it never joined @entity5 voluntarily			1
q. what happened next ? @entity161 , the @entity5 government did not take the pronouncement seriously			2
but after a series of rebel attacks , then - @entity5 president @entity164 sent in 40,000 @entity5 troops in 1994 to quash the insurgency			2
two years later , the forces withdrew after heavy losses on both sides			0
@entity5 and @entity21 declared a ceasefire			1
and though @entity5 still claimed it as part of its federation , the region was allowed to operate with substantial autonomy			1
but the peace did n't last			0
@entity35 why did n't the ceasefire hold ? @entity180 rebels continued to launch attacks			0
and many of the deadliest took place in other parts of @entity5			2
in september 1999 , for example , rebels bombed apartment buildings in @entity85 and the southern cities of @entity190 and @entity191			1
q. what did @entity5 do next ? @entity38 then - prime minister @entity95 vowed to crack down on the insurgency by sending in troops , a promise that partly ensured his election as president the following year			2
a second war followed from 1999 to 2009 , killing an estimated 15,000 @entity5 soldiers and 300,000 @entity143			2
more than one - third of @entity21 's residents were displaced and the region 's infrastructure was reduced to ruins			1
the @entity207 in 2002 named @entity21 's capital , @entity209 , " the most destroyed city on the planet			1
" human rights groups said @entity85 disregarded or suspended civil rights in its fight against terrorism , including committing illegal killings			0
for their part , @entity21 rebels also horrified the world with high - profile attacks targeting civilians			1
q. what were some of the deadliest attacks ? @entity227 fighters held 700 theater - goers hostage in a @entity85 theater in 2002			0
a @entity5 effort to free them resulted in the deaths of 120 hostages			0
@entity21 rebels were also accused of downing two @entity5 airplanes in 2004			1
and they took over a school in @entity235 in the @entity130 region in 2004			0
when the siege ended , more than 330 people had died , half of them children			0
just as @entity95 proclaimed that his policies were succeeding in @entity21 , the @entity243 president of the region and 20 others were killed by a bomb that went off under a stadium grandstand in 2004			1
but by 2009 , @entity5 had quashed the rebel movement to the point that it officially declared the war over			0
q. what is the situation in the region today ? @entity255 in @entity21 has ebbed , particularly following the death of @entity258 militant @entity257 in july 2006 in neighboring @entity128			2
@entity102 , a former rebel , is president of a @entity243 @entity21 government			0
rights groups say he rules with an iron fist and little regard for law			0
q. what about the insurgency ? @entity38 the insurgency itself has not so much ended as it has moved to the east and the west -- to the republics of @entity127 and @entity128 , where rebels are fighting troops to destabilize the region			2
it has also attracted foreign @entity258 militants ready to fight for the cause			0
" @entity21 's long and violent guerrilla war has attracted a small number of @entity258 militants from outside of @entity21 -- some of whom are @entity283 fighters with possible links to @entity285 , " the @entity277 said			2
an @entity287 report published in october 2012 warned that continued ethnic , religious , political and economic grievances could bring increased tensions in the @entity28			0
" the killing is unlikely to end soon , " it said			0
@entity35 was n't there mention of the conflict during the @entity295 ? @entity296 , the insurgency in the region made news after the deadly bombing at the @entity295 earlier this year			0
the suspects , @entity302 and @entity303 , were born in @entity304 but were ethnic @entity143			0
@entity102 distanced his republic from the brothers in @entity307 , saying , " they grew up in the @entity309 and their views and beliefs were formulated there			0
so you need to look for the roots of the evil in @entity309			0
" @entity5 's @entity95 visits victims of @entity2 blasts			1
