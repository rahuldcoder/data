-- hardcore junkies of the series " @entity3 " finally got their fix after a seven - year hiatus when @entity6 released 15 new episodes sunday , 3 a.m. et. to binge watch or not to binge watch , that is the question			1
" @entity13 's " @entity11 observed on @entity12 that the recaps from " people who watched all of @entity18 in one sitting ... sound like crazy coke heads			2
" binge - watch responsibly , everyone ! but whether you binge watch or spoon it out a week at a time , will you feel satisfied when it 's over ? to be fair , the anticipation for series ' return has been feverish and more than a year in the making , creating very high expectations			1
the first three seasons , which followed the outlandish antics of the dysfunctional @entity32 family , was on @entity33 from 2003 to 2006			2
those episodes were critically acclaimed and developed a sizable cult following -- a following that has only grown through dvds and online streaming			2
the new online streaming format on @entity6 gave creator @entity40 more freedom with episode length , allowing far more variability than in the tv format			1
to work around cast availability , as stars like @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 have moved on to busy careers , each episode focuses on one member of the @entity32 family rather than trying to incorporate the entire cast			2
so while everything feels familiar , it 's not the same old " @entity3			1
" some critics have welcomed the fresh presentation , praising @entity40 for pushing forward the show 's legacy : the @entity64 reporter : " the beauty about the @entity6 version of ' @entity3 ' is that , given the laws of time and hype , it should not have succeeded			1
... but the series quickly found its pacing , the elaborate ' @entity73 ' structure revealed its glorious ambition and the combination of absurdity and intelligence meshed as well or better than you might have remembered from the original three seasons			0
" @entity85 : " in a sense , it is not merely a continuation of the show , but a celebration of it			0
... i have , to be clear , watched it all -- and not with grim determination , but rather great , increasing satisfaction			0
... the show improves as it gathers context , and before long you stop thinking about what makes this ' @entity3 ' different			1
" @entity95 : " do the new episodes live up to those of the first three seasons which ended in 2006 ? yes , and then some : the new season is not only as smart and absurdly funny as ever , but also reflects the rapid changes in how we watch television			2
" yet others think the concept was a nice idea in theory that did n't pass muster in execution : @entity110 : " [ @entity111 ] he result was both exhilarating and a wee bit disappointing			0
... out of 15 episodes , there are four or five episodes i 'd put in the ' a ' range			0
there were two or three episodes i 'd put in the ' c ' range			0
and the majority of the episodes were variably uneven , hardly devoid of brilliance and the sort of hilarity that most currently running shows ca n't even approach , but usually diluted to an infuriating degree by the structure and lack of structure of the endeavor			0
" @entity136 : " ' @entity3 ' has lost a step or two in its long stint on the sidelines			1
the pacing is notably slower than during its original run and the show lacks the breathtaking density that characterized its glorious past			0
at its worst , the new / old ' @entity3 ' is reduced to doing an shaky imitation of itself : the characters and themes are there but the beats are slightly off , as is the tone			1
" variety : " ultimately , this ' arrested ' revival plays a bit like a reunion special , where the individual cast members come out and take their curtain calls			0
after the warmth of seeing them reunited ( or semi-reunited , given how rarely more than one or two are featured in a scene together ) , there 's a sort of awkwardness to it , as if nobody really has much to say			0
' @entity3 's ' long - awaited encore is like a lot of tv development -- namely , an interesting idea that was more exciting on paper			1
" @entity169 : " @entity170 episodes later ( after a few hours of sleep in between episodes 9 and 10 ) , and i was left disappointed			2
... maybe when i have some time in the future , i 'll give these new episodes another try , but if i 'm looking for my ' @entity3 ' fix , i 'll just go back to the original banana stand			1
" @entity178 : " @entity179 one up for the @entity180 : it has killed ' @entity3			1
' ... if you truly loved ( the first three seasons of ' @entity3 ' ) , it 's hard to imagine being anything but disappointed with this new rendition			1
" regardless of the mixed reactions , @entity40 and executive producer / narrator @entity188 have had nothing but gratitude for the show 's strong fanbase			1
" reaction from ' @entity3 ' fans so so gratifying , " @entity188 tweeted , while @entity40 posted a handwritten letter to @entity194			1
" it 's been our great joy to bring this to you on @entity6 , where you can access it whenever and however you want , " @entity40 wrote in the letter , dated may 25			2
" except , you know , it 's really meant to be watched in order			0
and you really should watch them all ... but really , this is yours now			0
except for the obvious copyright issues			0
and you have to subscribe to @entity6			0
" ok , so maybe it 's " not completely yours i guess , " @entity40 continued			2
but there 's still hope for the movie !			0

" @entity3 " *premiered* its fourth season on @entity215
the anticipation has been building for more than a year
overall , critics were slightly disappointed
creator @entity40 and producer @entity188 have thanked fans for support
