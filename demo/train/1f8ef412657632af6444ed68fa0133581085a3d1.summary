@entity0 -- after awaiting reforms that may or may not come , thousands of young undocumented immigrants have abandoned their @entity4 voluntarily or because they were deported			1
they still consider themselves @entity6 , but now they dream in @entity0			1
" i returned ( to @entity0 ) because in the @entity10 i always wanted to study dentistry			1
when i graduated from college , i ran into the problem that my great hope , the @entity6 , still had not been approved , " said @entity12 , who lived in @entity13 for eight years			1
the @entity6 -- @entity6 -- would remove a roadblock to education and a future in the @entity10 for such youths			1
undocumented immigrant youths have the right to study through high school			0
after that , they can study at private universities -- with high costs and without access to student loans -- or in public universities -- most of which charge them tuition at an " out - of - state " rate , which can be double what in - state students pay			2
only some states have laws allowing undocumented students to attend state universities at in - state rates			2
those who manage to graduate tend to find job offers for unskilled workers , offering low wages			0
" i think i returned because i know that my parents left to give us a better education , and while i was there , i felt that all of that effort was for naught if i worked as a florist , caring for someone 's baby or working at a butcher shop " 27 - year - old @entity58 said			2
she immigrated to @entity59 when she was 8 years old			0
now she works in the @entity61 capital as a sales operation analyst for a company and dreams of doing graduate studies in the same area			1
in general , undocumented immigrants in the @entity10 can not get a driver 's license or credit cards , and can not travel freely in the country			1
" i could n't move around like i wanted , and to go to school i had to drive with fear , " said @entity71 , 27			0
originally from @entity0 's east - central state of @entity75 , @entity71 lived in @entity76 for eight years			1
six states recently approved laws that allow the undocumented to have driver 's licenses			0
" everything seems nice on the surface , but you do n't really belong to that place and you 're never going to be @entity10 even if you have your papers , " said @entity82 , who voluntarily returned to her city , @entity84			1
between 2005 and 2010 , more than 1.4 million @entity61 returned to their country after living in the @entity10 , according to the @entity91			1
it is estimated that more than 400,000 of those who returned in the past decade were youths , according to a government - supported survey			0
in june 2012 , president @entity97 instituted a policy of deferred action that granted lawful status to undocumented youths who had arrived before their 16th birthdays , were in school or graduated , and had no major criminal records			0
the impact of returning only 5 % to 35 % of those who returned to @entity0 during the past five years and remained there did not go back voluntarily , the @entity91 estimates			1
the range is wide because " data on who is sent back and what happens to them are sketchy , " it says on its website			0
the majority had experienced a lack of educational and job opportunities , and increases in anti-immigrant policies , the center says , citing government data from both countries			1
in @entity71 's case , police stopped him on the state line between @entity76 and @entity123 , and he was detained for being in the country illegally			0
he spent three months in a detention center in @entity126 and later returned to @entity0 , where his mother awaited			1
" when i arrived i was very happy to see my family , but at the same time very sad because i had left everything behind , " he said			0
" all my dreams had collapsed			0
" @entity71 now works at a call center in @entity0 and dreams of studying dentistry at the @entity134			1
the majority of these youths migrated to the @entity10 because of their parents ' decisions and more than half crossed the border illegally			1
initially it was n't them , but their parents who sought the dream			0
" my mother was living in the @entity10 and she decided to take me there , " @entity71 said			2
" i did n't want to go because i did n't want to leave my friends and my relatives			0
" back in @entity0 , he now tries to find his own dream			1
in addition to having been deported or having returned voluntarily , these youths must unlearn the routines they grew into in the @entity10 , where they spoke @entity153 and ate tacos at home while they learned the @entity10 culture and honored the @entity10 flag			1
they find themselves immersed in a bicultural reality that can create feelings of not belonging , even when they return to @entity0			2
" i never felt like a @entity10 citizen , i always felt like a @entity61 , " said @entity160 , who lived in the @entity10 for 14 years			1
' from here and from there ' while it is true that the obstacles the youth face depend on individual circumstances , " 100 % go through traumatic events because of the separation and lack of belonging , " according to @entity171 , author of a book called " @entity173			1
" humiliation over a supposed failure and feelings arising from the combination of culture tend to be common , @entity174 said			0
" it 's hard to understand that they can be both from here and from there , " she said			0
" you belong to a country that you have not lived in , that you do n't know , " said @entity184 , president of the @entity185 , a @entity0 - based group that helps advise migrants			1
the loneliness and confusion in dealing with the new environment can push many youths to join organized crime , @entity184 said			0
" for example , those who arrive in ( the state of ) @entity196 , if they have a criminal record , will not find opportunities in the formal economy , " @entity184 said			0
" but he can put his @entity202 to use for organized crime , acting as a translator or smuggler of drugs toward the @entity10			2
" drowning in paperwork @entity174 leads a group that shares the name of her book , whose members insist on finding the @entity212 and seek opportunities in their country			0
the group , formed by youth immigrants who returned to @entity0 , was born out of the impact they suffered upon their return , feeling lost among the legal paperwork and social customs			1
they used a @entity224 page to orient themselves on how to maneuver through the @entity61 bureaucracy			2
many do n't speak @entity153 well and the @entity61 system does n't have programs for social reinsertion			1
" the migrants do n't know how to do the paperwork and to what agencies to go to , " @entity174 said			0
" returning to @entity0 and not speaking @entity153 or dressing a certain way , or liking a certain type of music , also creates conflict , " @entity160 said			1
to study in @entity0 , the education ministry requires that all documents be translated and bear the seal of the institute that issued them			2
unable to complete this step , these youths " are treated like undocumented immigrants in their own country , " @entity174 said			0
sometimes , a lack of family support or economic resources keep needed paperwork from being completed			0
" there are times when the schools in the @entity10 ask for their former student to show up in person to pick up documents , even though they 've been deported , " she said			2
in most cases , the young immigrants left their families in the @entity10			1
they dream of returning to see them or to earn a livelihood in @entity0 to bring them over			1
the loneliness and emotional exhaustion can bring feelings of not belonging to any place			0
but that is not true in every case			0
" i felt that i arrived and was here in my place here in @entity0 from day one , " @entity12 said			2
once they adapt to @entity61 society , many feel free			2
they enjoy not having to hide			0
they feel thankful for the country that once again is their home			0
" it 's true , i am achieving my @entity61 dream now in this moment , but my life is incomplete , " said another youth , @entity12			2
" i am far from my family			0

more and more @entity61 immigrants in the @entity10 are returning to @entity0
the so - called " @entity6 " go back for lack of opportunities stateside
they have to face *challenges* in *reintegrating* themselves to @entity0
some do n't speak @entity153 well and blend cultures
