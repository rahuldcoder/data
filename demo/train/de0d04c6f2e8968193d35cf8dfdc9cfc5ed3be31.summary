the @entity12 forward claimed outright top spot in the @entity15 scoring charts as he moved clear of @entity16 , who is in @entity17 with @entity18 for sunday 's @entity20 final against @entity22 side @entity21			1
@entity2 , smarting from last weekend 's 3 - 1 home defeat by the @entity25 and @entity26 champions , made the perfect start when @entity1 ran onto @entity29 's threaded pass to net in the 10th minute			1
goalkeeper @entity30 did well to stop @entity9 making an immediate reply , with the @entity4 captain pushing @entity34 's shot onto the post			2
@entity9 thought they had equalized in the 35th minute but @entity37 's effort was ruled out for a marginal offside following @entity42 's free - kick out wide , and @entity2 doubled the home team 's anguish by immediately doubling the lead			1
@entity43 , who like @entity1 scored in the midweek @entity45 first - leg win over third division @entity46 , was credited with another goal after making enough contact with @entity29 's chip into the box to distract keeper @entity51			2
@entity1 made it 3 - 0 in the 41st minute with his 19th league goal this season after being given too much space to shoot from outside the box			2
however , @entity2 went to the interval reduced to 10 men after defender @entity59 was sent off for striking the face of former @entity2 striker @entity61			0
@entity9 could not capitalize on that advantage , and @entity29 was finally rewarded in the 66th minute when he ran onto @entity64 's first - time pass and coolly slotted low past @entity51			0
@entity65 reduced the deficit when he fired through the legs of defender @entity68 in the 69th minute , but @entity34 was red - carded for a rash tackle from behind on @entity2 fullback @entity70			0
@entity1 netted from the penalty spot with five minutes left -- sealing his 13th treble for @entity2 -- after @entity64 was fouled by @entity73 in a challenge that saw the @entity75 forward carried off			0
his replacement @entity76 then scored his first league goal for @entity2 , with the @entity79 midfielder netting from @entity81 's low cross			0
@entity61 hit back in the second minute of time added on for his fifth in @entity15 to ensure a repeat scoreline from last season 's fixture			0
the defeat left @entity9 16 points behind @entity2 after 16 games , and facing the prospect of losing fifth place to @entity92 -- who visit third - placed @entity94 on sunday			2
@entity95 moved up to seventh with a 2 - 1 win at @entity97 that left the @entity18 - based club a point behind @entity9 and @entity92			1
@entity100 netted the winner with six minutes left , after captain @entity102 equalized for third - bottom @entity97 with his seventh goal this season in the 61st minute			1
@entity75 teenager @entity105 put @entity95 ahead after only two minutes as the 19 - year - old fired home from outside the box			0
@entity109 beat bottom club @entity110 2 - 1 to move up to eighth , despite having @entity4 midfielder @entity111 sent off midway through the first half			1
@entity113 put the visitors level from the resulting penalty , but his teammate @entity116 was dismissed for a second booking on 69 and @entity118 netted the @entity121 side 's winner with three minutes to play			0
@entity122 joined 10th - placed @entity123 on 19 points with a 2 - 1 win at @entity126 as @entity127 netted both goals			1
