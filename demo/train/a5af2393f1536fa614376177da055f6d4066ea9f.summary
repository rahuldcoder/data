in the @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity4 developed important new technologies : television , movie sound , refrigeration , automatic transmissions for cars			1
the supermarket was born , as were the passenger aviation industry and the first franchised food company : @entity15			2
big industrial companies such as @entity17 and @entity18 consolidated their dominance at the expense of weaker rivals			0
@entity22 and the federal government planned and opened the first freeways			0
millions of @entity3 moved off the farms of the @entity26 and @entity27 to populate @entity28 and @entity29			1
in a decade of economic deprivation , in other words , we can begin to see the shape of postwar @entity3 : the suburbanized , mass - production economy into which the baby boomers would be born			1
can we see any similar promise of progress today ? i think we can			2
i discern three glimmers of light on the horizon : 1			0
a transition has begun from coal to natural gas as @entity3 's most important source of electric power			1
natural gas emits about half as much carbon dioxide per unit of energy as coal			1
that 's not as clean as solar or wind , but those technologies can not ( yet ) compete on price			2
fracking offers hope that natural gas will soon cost least of all			1
if that hope comes true , the transition from coal to gas will generate a huge burst of economic activity and accelerate the transition to a more sustainable future for humanity			1
@entity3 are on the move again , this time from exurb and suburb to downtown , not only where you might expect it -- @entity74 -- but also where you would n't : @entity77 's most central census tracts added 20 % to their population from 2000 to 2010			1
@entity79 , @entity80 , added population for the first time since 1950			0
ten thousand people moved to downtown @entity84 ; 15,000 to @entity85 ' once ghostly downtown ; 2,000 to downtown @entity86			0
@entity87 is up 11 % since 2006			0
@entity88 in @entity89 is up 76 % in the past decade			0
the shift to a greener economy involves changes in the way we use space as much or more as changes in the way we use fuel : people reorganizing their lives in ways that allow them to walk to work rather than drive			0
the downtown revival remains a boutique industry			2
real densification will come as @entity3 add condo towers beside their suburban office parks and atop shopping malls ; as four - story and six - story multi-use buildings rise along the boulevards of @entity85 ; and as entrepreneurs invent 21st - century mass transit systems to interconnect them , such as @entity115 equipped jitney buses that arrive within 10 minutes of a tap on a smart phone			1
building new cities will put construction workers back on the job			0
living in them will liberate millions of person - hours from the waste of the commute			0
over the past 20 years since the advent of @entity126 , clinicians and researchers have developed a vastly enhanced understanding of depression			2
we as yet live in the infancy of mental health science , but the path forward from infancy is at last revealing itself			1
@entity5 is not only a source of terrible personal suffering but also a huge economic burden on society			2
it debilitates otherwise healthy people and may well prove the ultimate cause of drug and alcohol addiction , obesity and many industrial and auto accidents			0
deep into the 1930s , people regularly died from ordinary infections that today would barely cost them a day off work or school			0
( in 1924 , president @entity153 lost his 16 - year - old son to an infected blister , caused by playing tennis without socks on his feet			0
) half a century from now , will people look back as pityingly on our bafflement before nearly equally devastating but ultimately treatable mental illnesses ? what will they say of our practice of leaving the most severely mentally ill to walk uncared - for through the streets of our cities , sleeping on the streets and dying of cold and exposure ? in 1940 , health care remained a boutique industry , accounting for roughly 4 % of gross national product			1
in the decades since , health care has grown into one of @entity3 's most gigantic enterprises , 17 % of gdp -- arguably too much but still a huge driver of employment and investment			1
yet within this vast economic complex , mental health remains a stunted subdomain			1
research into diseases of the mind , the production of medicines , the training and employment of treatment personnel -- might these not emerge as giant industries of tomorrow ? it would be a very positive irony if this decade of economic depression should prove the era in which science at last broke the clammy grip of psychic depression			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

in the midst of today 's economic *troubles* , @entity199 sees reasons for hope
he says @entity3 's energy picture is changing fast with new *surplus* of natural gas
@entity3 are returning to urban areas , *shortening* commutes
@entity214 : while health industry has vastly expanded , mental health is a future growth field
