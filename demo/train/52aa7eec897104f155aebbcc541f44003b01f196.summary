-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 said sunday that @entity2 could accept a peace agreement with a " demilitarized @entity5 state " as its neighbor			1
@entity2 pm @entity1 said he would agree to peace with @entity5			2
in his first speech accepting the concept of a two - state solution for the @entity12 conflict , @entity1 set rigid conditions for moving forward			1
among them : unequivocal @entity5 recognition of @entity2 as the @entity17 national state with @entity18 as its capital , and full demilitarization for a @entity5 state -- no army , no rockets or missiles , no control of airspace			1
" i say this in a clear voice -- if we receive a guarantee of this demilitarized unit , we will be prepared to reach agreement to a demilitarized @entity34 side by side with the jewish state , " @entity1 said , according to a direct translation of his speech at @entity41 's @entity40 in @entity42 , @entity2			1
initial @entity5 reaction was negative , with @entity5 legislator @entity44 saying @entity1 was calling for creation of a ghetto state			1
" he is proving there is no partner for peace in @entity2 , " @entity44 told @entity0			0
chief palestinian negotiator @entity50 said @entity1 " left us with nothing to negotiate as he systematically took nearly every permanent status issue off the table			0
" " he announced a series of conditions and qualifications that render a viable , independent and sovereign @entity5 state impossible , " @entity50 said			0
" this speech fell far short of every single one of the benchmarks required of @entity2 in line with international law and existing agreements , " he said , including the 2003 @entity58			0
@entity1 's speech , billed as a major statement on the peace process , follows president @entity68 's recent high - profile speech to the @entity70 world and a visit to the region by @entity68 's @entity12 envoy , former @entity74 sen. @entity73			1
@entity68 welcomed @entity1 's speech as " an important step forward " and said the president remained committed to a two - state solution that would ensure @entity2 's security and provide the @entity5 " a viable state , " according to a @entity81 statement			1
@entity68 pledged to continue working with all parties " to see that they fulfill their obligations and responsibilities , " the statement said			0
@entity1 , of the center - right @entity87 , previously refused to endorse a two - state solution			1
@entity1 sounded themes popular with his conservative followers , repeatedly referring to @entity2 as the @entity17 national homeland and demanding recognition of that by all @entity96 foes , including the @entity5 , for any chance at a peace agreement			2
he prompted applause with his statement that " the land of @entity2 is homeland to the @entity17 people , and that is the basis of our right to it			0
" " the @entity5 leadership must rise up and say in a very straight way that we are tired of this conflict , we will recognize the right of the @entity17 people to have a national homeland in this part of the world , " @entity1 said , according to the direct translation			2
he said @entity18 would remain the capital of @entity2 -- refusing to yield on a sensitive issue for @entity5 -- and that a @entity5 state would have to be fully demilitarized to ensure the safety of @entity2			0
@entity68 , in his june 4 speech in @entity122 , @entity123 , endorsed a two - state solution and urged compromise between " two peoples with legitimate aspirations			1
" he repeated his call for both @entity2 and the @entity5 to fulfill all obligations under the 2003 @entity58 , including a halt to any expansion of @entity133 settlements by @entity2			0
@entity68 called @entity74 's bond with @entity2 " unbreakable " but said @entity5 have suffered in pursuit of a homeland			2
he also called for an end to @entity5 incitement against @entity2 and greater security in @entity5 territories			0
on sunday , @entity1 acknowledged the suffering on both sides from the continuing @entity12 conflict , but insisted the roots of the conflict came from the @entity96 world 's refusal to accept @entity2 's right to exist .			0
