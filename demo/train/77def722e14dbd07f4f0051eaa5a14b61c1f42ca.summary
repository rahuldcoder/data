-- a year ago , @entity1 was a pretty young woman			1
perhaps not typically model - pretty as the @entity3 has noted , but certainly fetching			2
in the old days , to go from , well , hot to famous , @entity4 would have needed not just looks but a truckload of luck , for fame was something bestowed by capricious media out to sell their next movie or magazine			1
but in the age of the @entity14 , all it took was a @entity16 video of @entity4 doing " the @entity19 " at a @entity18 game			1
it went viral , and now @entity4 is on the cover of the @entity23 swimsuit issue			1
fame is n't what it used to be			2
in the old days , fame was controlled not by the famous and certainly not by the audience , but by the owners of the media			1
it was so foreign and artificial a construct that we thought that fame made you special			2
the rules did n't apply to you			0
you had a certain ethereal glow			0
now that the @entity14 has pulled fame inside out , you do n't need to be blessed by the mass media to become famous			1
to paraphrase @entity45 , on the @entity14 , everyone will be famous to 15 people			1
in fact , everything important about fame has changed			2
to begin with , it used to be that the famous were foisted on us			2
if they wanted to make " @entity55 " famous for mopping up spills with a paper towel , they could			2
if they wanted to make talentless dream boys famous , they did			0
now fame is something we do -- we the audience , we the people on the @entity66			1
there 's nothing very complicated about how we do it : we create links , and we pass them around			0
that is the most basic and natural thing to do with a web like ours			0
so , if you happen to come across a video of a fan - made @entity77 musical spoof , in which you are struck by the presence of a young man named @entity81 playing @entity82 , of course you 'll tell your friends using your social media of choice : you tweet , you post on @entity87 or you might go old - fashioned and send out some e-mails			1
some of your friends will share your enthusiasm , so they retweet , repost , resend			0
with astonishing rapidity , the @entity77 musical accumulated more than 3 million views on @entity16 , and young @entity81 has 41,651 followers on @entity94			1
@entity81 , a bartender in @entity95 , is famous on the @entity14			1
after winning the @entity14 , @entity1 takes @entity23 's swimsuit cover this is possible because the basic idea of media has been transformed			1
in the days of broadcast , a medium was a channel through which messages were passed , connecting the publisher with the audience			0
on the @entity66 , the medium is n't the message			0
the medium is the audience			0
so , when someone becomes famous on the @entity14 , it 's because we the @entity110 decided to move that person 's message along			1
and this gives rise to two odd web phenomena			0
first , on the @entity66 we sometimes make people famous for inexplicable reasons			1
for example , one of the first @entity66 - famous people was @entity122 , a @entity123 photographer whose home page ( remember them ? ) welcomed viewers with a big " i kiss you ! ! ! ! ! " message			1
@entity122 's page was the opposite of slick , and his enthusiastic explanation of his interests was in less than perfect @entity134			0
there was absolutely no reason in 1999 for his page ( which had been slightly " enhanced " by hackers ) to go viral			0
certainly some who passed around the link did so to make mean - spirited fun of a man who turned out to be something of a sweetheart			0
but many who shared the link to @entity122 's page did so in part because it asserted that we the audience could make an obscure person famous overnight			1
it was " sticking it to the old media " that had for so many years rammed commercial nonentities into our brains			0
and it 's happened countless times			0
that we can now can make people famous also explains the deglamorization of fame on the @entity14			1
the people we make famous and sometimes rich are usually @entity165			2
they make spelling errors when they tweet from their mobile phones			0
they treat us with a rough but real respect			0
they are people such as comedian @entity173 , who used the @entity66 's power to bypass the standard marketing machinery and offer his standup video for download on his own site ( he made $ 1 million in 12 days )			1
he is loved by his fans not despite his flaws , but because those flaws show that he is one of us			0
and do n't even ask about what happens when a celebrity ventures onto the @entity66 thinking fame makes him not one of us			0
( @entity187 , @entity188 ? ) now , all of this is complicated because we are in a hybrid culture that is shaped both by the broadcast media and by the @entity14			1
internet celebrities cross over into the mainstream , and the traditional mainstream star - making machinery still works			2
just look at the @entity66 's complex relationship with @entity198 and @entity199			2
nothing is simple , especially fame , now that the audience is the medium and fame is of , by , and for us			0
follow @entity206 on @entity94 join the conversation on @entity87 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 : @entity1 's @entity16 video *helped* *catapult* her onto @entity23 swimsuit cover
he says fame in the age of the @entity14 is different ; web users can *elevate* anyone to fame
famous - on - the - @entity14 people are often picked because they are like us , he says , not stars
*writer* : fame is in a hybrid state now , with complex relationships between web and mainstream
