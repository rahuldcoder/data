" go , go , go ! " there 's no need for the driving instructor to repeat his brief command when the go pedal in question is attached to a ravishing red @entity8 with a majestic exhaust note			2
swinging onto a four - lane highway just outside @entity8 's @entity14 headquarters in @entity15 , there 's the heady sensation of accelerating through the gears as the big v8 engine barks and crackles in response			1
but up ahead of us , a police car in the slow lane brings our rapid progress back down to a more leisurely speed			0
no matter -- there 's a chance to repeat the experience a couple more times during the drive			0
it 's all part of the experience in @entity15 's " @entity35 , " an area that runs broadly between the towns of @entity38 , @entity14 and @entity39 , and encompasses the museums , showrooms and factories of such supercar names as @entity8 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , plus @entity47 for motorbike enthusiasts			1
this is the place for anyone whose engine is fired by new high - performance sports cars with bodies by @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
in @entity14 , it 's a case of pay your money and take a drive in your pick of red ferraris : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
that 's 100 euros ( $ 125 ) for 20 minutes in the @entity8 , 350 euros for 60 minutes in the @entity70 or 1,500 euros for two hours in the @entity68			0
and there are @entity45 and @entity44 options for those looking beyond a @entity8			0
' @entity74 ' most people come to @entity14 to visit the @entity76 ( @entity8 , 43 , @entity14 ; +39 0536 949713 ) a red - on - red extravaganza of @entity79 grand prix cars , sports racers from the 1950s through to the 1970s , unique concept cars and up - to - the - minute @entity8 models such as the @entity8 and @entity83			1
the current exhibition on the theme " @entity74 " has rooms devoted to @entity8 's involvement in @entity88 , @entity89 , the @entity90 and @entity92 technology			0
apart from viewing the fabulous car collection , there 's the opportunity to try an @entity79 simulator or become part of a tire - change pit crew racing against the clock			1
buying a combined ticket at @entity14 also gives entry to @entity104 's @entity103 @entity102 ( @entity38 , @entity105 , 85 , @entity38 ; + 39 059 4397979 ) , a yellow turtle - shaped building that tells the life story of the @entity8 founder through a marvelous collection of the cars he drove and created			1
this museum is , until january 2015 , given over to an exhibition of 100 years of @entity44 ( the @entity115 group now owns both @entity8 and @entity44 ) , featuring 21 classic vehicles that include the 1932 @entity117 , a 1955 300 s sports racer and a 2006 @entity119			0
next door to the museum is the house where @entity102 was born			0
while the @entity44 exhibition is on , the ground floor of the house is hosting such notable vehicles as the first car to bear the @entity8 name -- the 1947 125 s -- plus a 1952 500 f2 single - seat racer and a 1954 750 @entity131			2
for @entity44 devotees , there are an equally impressive range of cars at the privately - owned @entity136 ( @entity138 dairy farm , @entity139 320 , 41100 @entity38 ; +39 059 510660 ) , housed on the @entity138 organic dairy farm on the outskirts of @entity38			1
this was part of the original @entity145 collection that was to be sold at auction in @entity147 at the end of 1996 , before the @entity150 family stepped in to ensure the cars stayed in @entity15			1
it includes such rarities as a 1936 6 cm , a 1934 6 c , a 1953 @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity157 sports racers and the 1990 @entity159 prototype , along with the 1958 @entity160 @entity161 that @entity162 raced at @entity131			1
cars and cheese there 's an extra incentive to visit this free museum : the chance to buy some of its distinctive @entity170 cheese two museums cater to @entity45 lovers : @entity45 ( @entity104 , 12 , @entity173 ; +39 051 6817.611 ) at the company 's @entity173 factory midway between @entity38 and @entity39 , and the family - owned @entity176 at @entity178 , a little to the north of @entity39			1
with @entity45 now part of the @entity183 , its factory museum has an outstanding range of vehicles on display			0
these include the first production @entity189 , and such recent creations as the 2010 @entity191 ( @entity192 ) lightweight track car and the 2013 @entity195 single seater that 's based on a @entity196 but takes its design cues -- canopy style door and a body made of anti-radar material -- from either a jet fighter or an @entity204 attack helicopter , depending on your perspective			2
right behind the @entity191 sits a police highway patrol @entity196			0
classic early @entity45 models on display include the @entity210 ( and its 2006 reinterpretation ) , the @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215			0
the @entity217 museum ( @entity216 , @entity218 , @entity39 ; +39 051 86 26 28 ) displays more of the industrialist family 's beginnings in tractors , but includes a replica of the 1963 @entity224 prototype , examples of the @entity210 , @entity213 , @entity226 , @entity215 and military suvs , plus @entity45 - powered offshore racing boats and the @entity229 created by @entity217 's son @entity230			1
at @entity231 , near the town of @entity233 on the @entity38 - @entity39 rail line , supercar newcomer @entity46 has a showroom ( @entity236 , 5 , @entity237 , @entity231 ; +39 059 4739201 ) with examples of its @entity240 and @entity241 models on display			1
power , passion , performance by arrangement , it 's possible to join a tour of the @entity46 factory			0
for those with the time , there are two more destinations in @entity15 for car lovers			2
there 's @entity256 , home of the @entity258 ( @entity258 , @entity256 : @entity259 , 123 @entity260 , @entity256 ; + 39 030 336 5631 ) that celebrates the history of the 1,000 - mile road race that ran from @entity256 to @entity263 and back between 1927 and 1957 , and @entity264 , where the @entity265 ( @entity266 ; +39 11 677666/7/8 ) ) has reopened after a lengthy renovation			2
as befits @entity15 's premier car museum , @entity264 is a tour de force of automotive history and creativity : 160 models from 80 different makers , thematically arranged to cover design , production , sporting achievements and technological change			1
from the first car to appear on @entity15 roads ( the 1892 @entity286 ) to the 1907 @entity287 that won the 1907 @entity290 - @entity289 race , through to the 1948 @entity292 202 " rolling sculpture , " the 1952 @entity280 ( @entity281 ) and the latest @entity283 concept car , this is a masterful collection			1
there 's a bonus on sundays , the one day of the week when @entity115 opens its free @entity296 ( @entity297 ) on @entity298 ( @entity298 , 20 , @entity264 ; +39 011 006 6240 )			0
the center is home to a fascinating collection of cars , trains , planes , tractors , model ships and advertising memorabilia			0
cars on display include the first 3.5 @entity115 , the monstrous 1924 land speed record holder @entity311 , classics such as the 1929 @entity313 -- rated one of the most beautiful vehicles of its era -- and the post-war @entity318 and @entity319 1100 s @entity258			0
for enthusiasts enamored of the power , passion , performance and panache of @entity15 motoring , these eight museums well and truly deliver on their promise			2
@entity328 ! getting behind the wheel several companies in @entity14 offer @entity8 driving packages : @entity332 @entity333 @entity334 freelance journalist and classic car enthusiast @entity335 is a former @entity337 business editor for @entity0			2
