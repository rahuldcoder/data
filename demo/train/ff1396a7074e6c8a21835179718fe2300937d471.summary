-- the @entity1 2011 lists the @entity3 soap opera " @entity4 " as the " most popular soap opera -- current " for its success not only at home , but abroad			1
the show can be seen in more than 110 countries and garnered 24.5 million viewers across the globe in 2008 , making it more watched than any other telenovela or soap opera on television , according to @entity1			1
too bad daytime dramas are n't doing as well in the @entity17			1
as fans mourn the impending loss of long - running soap operas " @entity21 " and " @entity22 , " such dramas in other countries and in other languages are thriving			1
in @entity27 , fans are closely following the trials and tribulations of the @entity30 on " @entity31 , " while there 's plenty of drama being stirred up in @entity35 on the popular @entity37 soap , " @entity38			2
" audiences in the @entity40 have been enthralled with " @entity41 " since it debuted in 1985 and the @entity43 get their soapy fix with " @entity45 , @entity46 , " or " @entity47 , @entity48			2
" " @entity54 " in @entity55 offers plenty of crickey , hard - bodied , soapy action while the @entity52 enjoy " @entity53 " ( " at home " )			0
even in @entity58 , the @entity57 telenovelas are racking up ratings that most soaps would envy			1
@entity61 , co-editor of the book " @entity63 , " said part of the issue could be a matter of timing			0
" soap operas are considered part of daytime ( tv ) here and they are considered part of prime time ( tv ) in many other areas , " he said			1
" when @entity17 soaps air elsewhere , when @entity40 and @entity55 soaps air and when telenovelas air , a good portion of them air at night and they do n't necessarily have some of the same stigmas of daytime programming in the @entity17 " despite their vaunted place in @entity58 television history , soaps have not always received the praise or recognition of their night time counterparts			1
many of the original television soap operas began as radio programs which made the leap to the small screen in the 1950s and 1960s when the country had a very different landscape			1
advertisers rushed to get onboard with the hopes of snagging the interest -- and dollars -- of the stay - at - home mothers who watched the programs			0
by the 1980s , the shows experienced a pop culture revival with the help of characters like @entity105 and @entity106 on " @entity107 " and gave several major stars their first break in the business			0
according to @entity112 , when @entity105 and @entity106 married in 1981 , 14 million viewers tuned in to watch , while now the soap averages an audience between 2.5 to 3 million			2
but the long - running nature of the soaps , where fans can literally check back in years later and catch right up , is not playing as well with today 's viewers			2
@entity119 , editor of @entity119 , told @entity112 that shifting viewer demographics are to blame			0
" women are not at home in the same numbers they used to be , " she said			0
" mothers used to pass the soap - watching bug on to their daughters -- that just does n't happen now			2
" instead , today 's soaps are competing with the drama of reality television shows and the time suck that can be social networking			2
that craving for a storyline is still there and @entity138 , president and chief executive officer of @entity140 , said telenovela audiences enjoy that weaving of a tale			2
" there is a difference between our telenovela and the soap operas in the @entity17 , " he said			1
" the soap operas in the @entity17 are ongoing while our telenovelas are like if you were reading a book which has a beginning and an ending and through it people try to live the life of the protagonist			1
i think the success is in having a beginning and an ending because people do n't get tired of watching something			0
" @entity138 's company is the producer of the telenovela , " @entity164 , " which is the highest - rated domestically produced telenovela			0
the show recently presented its grand finale on the @entity170 network which drew more than 9.7 million viewers , according to @entity173 data			0
" @entity164 " also did gangbusters in @entity58 countries , @entity138 said , a testament to the cultural importance of such shows in the @entity57 community			1
the history of the telenovela began decades ago , @entity138 said , with illustrators producing comic book - style pamphlets of operas and plays that the poor population in @entity58 countries could n't afford to attend			1
from there , telenovelas share a history with soaps in that the stories morphed into radio programs and later television shows , he said			1
@entity138 said the popularity of telenovelas in the @entity17 are a mirror of the success they have found in @entity58 where every channel has multiple series			1
when one ends , a new one takes its place and audiences follow , he said			2
" they are very basic , " he said			0
" it 's a love story , even if it has a little bit of suspense or a little bit of comedy ; they always involve a love story			0
" @entity213 , with the @entity57 marketing firm @entity214 told @entity0 she understands the appeal of the telenovelas			2
" i 'm not surprised to see the success because it 's something that the @entity57 community has grown up with , " she said			0
" it 's part of our family , part of our life , since we 're younger , family , grandparents , parents , brothers , sisters			0
so i 'm not surprised			0
" the popularity of the telenovelas is expected to increase			1
according to @entity173 data " by 2050 , @entity57 are projected to account for more than 30 % of the @entity17 population " and that number will be reflected in the ratings			1
" the @entity57 consumer represents the greatest potential for sustained growth in the @entity17 today , " said a recent @entity173 report titled " what you think you know vs. what you need to know about @entity17 hispanics and @entity241			1
" " at the current rate of expansion , @entity57 will drive population growth and , in turn , consumption in @entity58 for the next generation			2
" so while the future looks brighter for telenovelas , soap operas appear to be in their winter of discontent			1
soap actor @entity255 said in @entity61 's book that the shows , which now are down to only four left out of 20 in years past , are on their way out			0
" this is not a genre that will be around in another 50 years , " @entity255 said			0
" in many respects , it is n't necessary			0
they have made their mark , and almost every type of medium owes something to the way the soaps have been put together , whether they want to admit it or not			0
" editor @entity61 , who has written about the demise of @entity58 soaps for @entity273 , said whether or not @entity58 soaps are headed for extinction in the short term remains to be seen			1
" ultimately that will be up to the networks and the advertisers , " he said			0
" there are four ( soap operas ) still on the air in the @entity17 and that 's 20 hours week			1
there are plenty of other genres on tv that do n't have that much programming			0
" @entity0 's @entity289 contributed to this report			0

@entity58 soap operas often pull larger audiences abroad
soaps across the globe are also enjoying popularity
telenovelas are hot right now in the @entity17 and pulling in big ratings
