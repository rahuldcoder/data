@entity0 -- at pricey fundraisers -- where there 's plenty of freedom to offer an unvarnished view of the world away from the cameras -- president @entity10 is sounding increasingly pessimistic about his party 's chances in the midterm elections			1
at a thursday fundraiser at the @entity16 home of actress @entity17 , @entity10 complained @entity18 have a " congenital disease " during midterm cycles , repeating a diagnosis he has used before			1
" we get depressed too easily , " @entity10 joked			1
" we 're terrible at paying attention to midterm elections , " he continued			2
the gloomy mood is understandable			2
former top cabinet secretaries , and even @entity27 , are hammering his policies			2
key @entity18 candidates are avoiding him , and in at least one case , unwilling to say if she voted for him			1
next month 's elections loom at a moment of great hand - wringing for the president 's party			2
understanding full well @entity10 's unpopularity is a drag on some @entity18 in tight congressional races , @entity39 officials are signaling to party leaders and campaign managers alike there will be no consequences should they run away from the president in order to win			1
@entity10 has yet to acknowledge his own weak standing with the public at any of his political events			1
instead , the president appears to blame what he describes as obstructionist @entity53 and a polarized , vapid news media			0
" we live in such a cynical time , partly because of how the media is now structured , " @entity10 said at @entity17 's home			1
" we only listen to folks who feed our biases and our inclinations			0
and bad news tends to attract the most attention , " he added			0
at an earlier event in the day , @entity10 used stark language to label @entity39 @entity53 refusals to pass immigration reform " suicide			1
" the president seemed to retool at least part of his midterm pitch , after declaring his policies are " on the ballot " in november , a line that his former strategist @entity75 called a mistake			0
in @entity78 , there was a re-write to that declaration			0
" my name is not on the ballot , " @entity10 said in @entity16			1
" but our values and our ideals ... are at stake , " he added , avoiding any reference to his " policies			0
" @entity18 candidates in critical races across the country are scrambling to distance themselves from both @entity10 and his policies , especially in the south where the president remains deeply unpopular			1
in @entity95 , @entity18 @entity94 candidate @entity93 refused to answer whether she had ever voted for @entity10 during an appearance before the @entity98 editorial board thursday			1
" you know , this election is n't about the president , " @entity93 said			0
" i was actually , in ' 08 , a delegate for @entity102 , " she added			0
as he starts his own midterm push , the president is sticking to friendlier turf			0
in @entity105 , he made an unannounced stop at the campaign office of @entity18 congressional candidate @entity108 , a state senator running for the seat vacated by outgoing rep. @entity110 ( @entity111 ) @entity105			1
" @entity105 is right at the heart of the battle for control of the @entity39 , " @entity10 said to volunteers at @entity108 's call center			1
" because of just the day - to - day work you 're doing , making phone calls , making sure our voters turn out , answering people 's questions about what the issues are , it makes a difference -- that 's how i was able to get elected			0
" @entity39 officials reject the notion that the president 's mood is grim			0
@entity10 's message at upcoming public campaign events will likely differ in tone and substance from remarks he makes at fundraisers , another official added			1
@entity10 will campaign with @entity141 governor @entity140 on october 15 , @entity39 officials announced thursday			2
@entity10 's advisers argue the president still has the ability to excite base @entity18 supporters who were instrumental to his two successful runs for the @entity39			1
steering clear of @entity10 , they argue , is also a gamble			2
" we 're not bringing him in to suppress voter turnout , if that 's what you 're asking , " @entity149 quipped to the @entity150			0
as soon as the president steps onto the stage in @entity141 , the president 's rhetoric will be placed under a microscope			0
" not a great way to go out of office , angry and blaming the system , " former presidential adviser and @entity1 political analyst @entity159 said			0
" my sense of it is he 's on an emotional roller coaster , " @entity159 added			0
once the midterms are over , @entity159 suggested a reshuffling of top @entity39 staff to buoy the president 's prospects for his final years in office			2
" if he shook it up a little bit , that would help , " @entity159 said .			0
