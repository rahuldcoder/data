-- president @entity1 campaigned in @entity3 's car country on monday after his administration filed a trade complaint against @entity7 's auto industry subsidies , while @entity9 challenger @entity8 complained the move was " too little , too late			1
" @entity8 spoke monday to the @entity3 hispanic @entity11 in his attempt to diminish the president 's advantage with the @entity17 vote , a traditionally @entity19 demographic that strongly supported @entity1 in 2008			1
with the november election just over seven weeks away , @entity1 seeks to maintain the momentum of a perceived " bounce " in support following this month 's @entity24 while @entity8 wants to gain ground on his rival ahead of the three presidential debates next month			1
@entity8 makes push for @entity12 voters in speeches at @entity30 in @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity1 focused on the auto sector that , according to industry research , supports almost 800,000 jobs in @entity37			1
the president touted both the auto industry bailout from his first year in office , noting @entity8 at the time called for letting @entity42 go bankrupt on its own , and his administration 's new complaint with the @entity45 that accuses @entity7 of providing $ 1 billion in illegal subsidies to auto and auto parts exporters between 2009 and 2011			1
" you can talk a good game , but i like to walk the walk , not just talk the talk , " @entity1 said of @entity8 , accusing the former @entity50 governor of backing companies that outsourced @entity3 jobs to @entity7 while a private equity investor			1
@entity58 : ' i 'm the 47 % , but you 're wrong , @entity8 ' " we 've brought more trade cases against @entity7 in one term than the previous administration did in two -- and every case we 've brought that 's been decided , we 've won , " @entity1 continued in @entity31 , adding that the subsidies being challenged " directly harm working men and women on the assembly line in @entity37 and @entity71 and across the @entity72			1
" his voice rising to a shout , @entity1 said to cheers : " it 's not right ; it 's against the rules ; and we will not let it stand			0
" critics of @entity3 trade policy say a tougher line with @entity7 is necessary			2
@entity8 labeled the administration 's move an election - year stunt in comparison to what he called his own consistent criticism of @entity7 as an unfair trade partner			1
" the president may think that announcing new trade lawsuits less than two months from the election will distract from his record , but @entity3 businesses and workers struggling on an uneven playing field know better , " @entity8 told the @entity88 in @entity89			1
in an earlier statement , @entity8 said @entity1 " has spent 43 months failing to confront @entity7 's unfair trade practices			1
" @entity8 ads paint plans to help middle class in broad strokes the @entity45 is the global organization that referees trade disputes between nations			2
in the last decade , the @entity7 auto industry has grown rapidly as the nation 's expanding middle class made the country the world 's largest market for car purchases , with @entity112 now selling more cars in @entity7 than in the @entity3			0
according to @entity116 estimates , up to 60 % of @entity7 's auto parts exporters benefit from subsidies , making it hard for @entity3 companies to compete			0
@entity3 trade representative @entity120 said in a statement on monday that @entity7 agreed when it joined the @entity45 in 2001 to eliminate the kind of export subsidies targeted by the new @entity3 complaint			1
@entity1 's mixed record on trade @entity37 is considered one of the most important battleground states of the november election , offering 18 electoral votes and the historical footnote that no @entity9 has ever won the presidency without carrying it			2
in his speech to the @entity12 businessmen , @entity8 touched on economic and education issues important to @entity17 communities			1
@entity1 's policies made things worse for @entity17 , he said , citing higher unemployment and increased poverty compared to when the president took office			1
" no one is exempt from the pain of this economy , but the @entity12 community has been particularly hard hit , " @entity8 said			0
he offered some new details on his budget - cutting plans , saying he would save $ 500 billion by reducing government employment by 10 % through attrition while combining agencies and departments to reduce overhead and linking government compensation to private sector levels			0
@entity8 also promised to " permanently fix our immigration system , " the latest in a series of attempts to appeal to @entity12 voters despite polls showing the @entity9 presidential nominee faces a sizable deficit among the key voting group			2
opinion : can @entity8 connect with @entity17 voters ? @entity1 leads @entity8 among @entity17 registered voters by 64 % -27 % , according to a recent @entity169 poll			1
later this week , both candidates will separately answer questions from the @entity173 - language television network @entity172 as part of outreach to @entity12 voters			0
@entity8 has struggled in the past to frame his positions on immigration in ways that appeal to @entity12 voters as well as the conservative base of the @entity9			0
on monday , he repeated past support for requiring employers to verify the legal status of workers and to simplify immigration laws while strengthening border security			0
he also reiterated his opposition to amnesty -- a code word for the @entity191 proposed by @entity19 and backed by @entity1 that would provide a path to legal status for children of illegal immigrants brought to @entity3 by their parents			0
at the same time , he expressed support for giving permanent residency to those who served in the military or obtained an advanced degree , and blasted @entity1 for failing to deliver on a 2008 campaign promise of immigration reform			2
" despite his party having majorities in both house of @entity208 , super majorities , the president never even offered up a bill , " @entity8 said			2
" like so many issues confronting our nation , when it comes to immigration , politics have been put ahead of people for too long			0
" at a @entity9 presidential candidate debate in january , @entity8 said he favored a system of " self - deportation , " a policy that involves making economic conditions so difficult for undocumented workers that they choose to leave the country to find better opportunities			0
that stance was derided by @entity19 and his @entity9 rivals			0
@entity8 retools campaign message @entity1 's campaign released a web video on monday denouncing @entity8 's " @entity238 , @entity239 , " claiming the candidate was attempting to " overhaul his positions and slow his sharply declining popularity in the @entity17 community			1
" " can @entity8 cover up his belief in self - deportation as an immigration solution with a bold new wallpaper choice ? " @entity244 asks			0
" will a new window treatment help disguise his cuts to education and college scholarships ? if he does something amazing with spackle , will people forget he 's promised over and over again to repeal @entity252 on day one - denying millions of @entity254 comprehensive health care coverage ? and on his promise to veto the @entity191			0
... well , duct tape can fix everything , ca n't it ? " on another issue , a new poll on monday showed that more respondents favored @entity1 over @entity8 on their handling of anti-american unrest in @entity265 world countries			1
the @entity267 survey showed that 45 % approved of @entity1 's handling of the attacks on @entity3 embassies and diplomatic compounds while 36 % disapproved , compared to 26 % approving @entity8 's actions while 48 % disapproved			1
meanwhile , a pair of television ads released monday by the @entity8 campaign focused on the nation 's economy , which voters identify as their main issue of concern			2
in the first ad , @entity8 speaks interview - style about proposals he claims will help bolster earnings for middle income @entity17 and ultimately create 12 million new jobs before the end of a potential first term			2
the ad generally repeats @entity8 's main campaign themes on the economy without offering new details			0
the second ad on monday features a narrator listing problems with the nation 's economy since @entity1 took office			0
" @entity1 : more spending , more debt , failing @entity3 families , " the ad says			0
excerpts : @entity8 vows to ' permanently fix our immigration system ' @entity306 's @entity305 and @entity307 and @entity0 's @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 contributed to this report .			0
