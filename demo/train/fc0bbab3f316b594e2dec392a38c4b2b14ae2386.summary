-- not many people can combine a dream vacation with their place of work			2
but not many people " work " by drawing pictures in the sand on the beach			1
@entity10 , 42 , is an " earthscape artist			1
" he uses rope and a rake to create large geometric drawings on beaches			1
his work can span an entire beach -- often covering 9,300 square meters ( 100,000 square feet ) in area -- and usually takes little longer than two hours to create			1
that 's useful , for his canvas is ephemeral , often subject to rogue waves , high tides ( he always sculpts during low tide ) and dogs			2
none of that fazes the former computer technician , who has so far drawn hundreds of short - lived artworks on around 30 beaches in the @entity32 , @entity33 and the @entity34			2
he 's been commissioned to create backdrops for marriage proposals , memorial ceremonies , commercial artwork for a car company and offers workshops for people who want to learn how to create their own beach art. " ultimately , when it is finished , i let it go , " he says			2
" for me the energy and draw is around the act of creation			0
" inspired by crop circles @entity9 was drawn to ancient geometric art after studying crop circle reconstructions			1
then , one cloudless day 10 years ago on @entity53 on the @entity55 island of @entity56 , @entity9 was showing a friend the geometric art he 'd been studying using a stick in the sand			1
" [ i drew ] one circle and [ explained to my friend ] the meaning it has had for people ; two overlapping circles and the line between their centers ; three overlapping circles which form a triangle , " @entity9 tells @entity0			1
" i suddenly realized that all of the crop circle reconstructions i had been studying start in this exact way , which establish reference points for everything that follows			0
" it felt like a bolt from the heavens , in which i had a vision that i could do enormous designs on the sand			0
" in 2004 , @entity10 drew his first piece on @entity83 in @entity84 , a wide beach near @entity9 's home			1
his work grew from there			0
dogs not the artist 's ally @entity9 keeps a log of ideas on flash cards and picks one before heading to the beach			1
he 's created hundreds of beach murals on just 30 or so beaches			2
not every beach provides the right conditions			0
" the needs i have in a beach have been such that there are few that are available to me , " says @entity9			1
" i need a large beach that is relatively flat			0
then i need a high high tide followed by a low , low tide			0
these occur several times of the month			0
" at these times the canvas i have to work with is maximized			0
other considerations are the scenery of the beach and the quality of the sand -- some dries faster than others			0
" i also appreciate beaches without a lot of traffic , particularly dogs -- they 're the worst for creating scars in the sand			2
" @entity9 hopes to inspire people to " follow what brings you joy			1
" " i did this art for many years without pay simply because it was so enlivening to do so , " says @entity9			1
" if i can inspire others , i hope that i can offer the message that the path is more important than the destination -- that the journey should be the focus			0
" when one is experiencing joy , then the world also receives that joy			0
and the world can always use more joy			0
