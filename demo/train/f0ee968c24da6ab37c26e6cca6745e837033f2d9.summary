-- the letter is signed " cordially " but students who received the instruction to stop handing out condoms on campus say they were taken aback by demands they feel could go as far as threatening their rights			1
various dorm rooms at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , have a " @entity15 " symbol on their door			1
that signifies that inside are male and female condoms , personal lubricant and safer sex information , according to @entity20			0
" if you are in need of condoms , you may knock ( on ) one of these doors and just ask ! " the group 's website says			2
@entity27 , chair of @entity20 , told @entity0 that the college has always been aware of the group 's activities			1
" we 've had a positive and open relationship with the administration up to this point , " she said			0
but earlier this month , college administrators sent letters to students whose dorm room doors have the logo saying that distributing condoms on campus " is not in concert with the mission of @entity10 as a @entity43 and @entity44 university			1
" " should we receive any reports that you are , in fact , distributing condoms on campus , the matter would be referred to the student conduct office for disciplinary action by the @entity60 , " concluded the letter sent by dean of students @entity49 and director of residence life @entity51			1
" private universities have the right to set their own policies and to discipline students who violate their policies			2
the distribution of condoms is incongruent with the university 's values and traditions , " @entity66 , spokesman for @entity10 , told @entity0 on wednesday			1
" the university has commitments to uphold in regards to catholic social teaching			0
students are aware of that when they enroll here			2
this is a group of students who are trying to challenge those commitments in a very public manner , " he said			2
the @entity20 group is not recognized by the university and gets its funding elsewhere			2
it claims to be the only resource on the @entity10 campus that provides free sexual health programming , information and physical resources for students -- mostly from dorm rooms			1
every three to four weeks , the organization also hands out condoms on public sidewalks , which is what the university so vehemently opposes			0
@entity66 said the college administration reached out repeatedly but unsuccessfully about the matter but @entity27 said the " abrupt e-mail " was the first warning			0
" it 's disappointing that they sent a very threatening letter to individuals that are stepping up and providing resources to students that @entity10 is not , " @entity27 said			1
the group 's next stop was to check in with the local branch of the @entity111 , which said @entity10 could be violating the rights of students by threatening disciplinary action against them			1
" while @entity10 is religiously affiliated it 's not a church , " @entity116 , an attorney at @entity111 of @entity12 told @entity0			1
" the religious freedom is that they can speak out ; they can express their values and views and can try to persuade people of them , but not to the extent of punishing those who have a different view of contraception , " she said			0
for now , @entity27 is hoping to be able to sort things out with the college			0
but if a legal resolution was sought , one expert says @entity10 has a strong case			2
" i think it 's one thing if it 's off - campus			0
but on campus grounds , i suspect that the university is on firm legal footing there			0
it does have the right to set its own policies , " @entity141 , @entity0 legal contributor said			0
" you ca n't force a private institution to allow that , " she said			0
@entity10 is a private university , founded in 1863 , that is " committed to maintaining , and strengthening the @entity44 , @entity148 , " according to the school 's website			1
a total of 14,600 students are enrolled .			0

student group providing contraception says it offers a *service* @entity10 does not
but the college says they *'re* challenging its @entity43 and @entity44 traditions
the @entity111 is now involved , and believes students ' rights could be being violated
