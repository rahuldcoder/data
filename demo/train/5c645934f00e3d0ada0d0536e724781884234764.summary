-- with sunday 's release of the @entity4 handheld console , @entity1 is hoping that bigger is better			1
the new unit is essentially a big brother to the @entity4 released in the spring of 2011 , but the gaming company has said it plans to continue to produce both types of consoles at least in the near future			1
the @entity12 's main screen is 90 % larger than its smaller counterpart , while the @entity15 screen on the top half of the clamshell design is nearly the same size as the @entity20 front touch screen			1
in full @entity15 mode , the resolution on the @entity4 ( 800px x 320px ) is still below the @entity20 's ( 960px x 544px )			1
but you are n't going to be playing @entity25 games on the @entity4 or vice versa , so the visual appearance is n't going to be obvious			2
it also comes with a stronger battery ( about 3.5 to 6 hours of charge using @entity4 software ) while not increasing the overall weight of the device			1
@entity35 adapters are not included for @entity37 or @entity38 versions but are included for @entity40 and @entity41 distribution			0
everything else pretty much remains the same between the @entity12 and the regular version -- front and back cameras , @entity15 screen at the top and touch screen at the bottom , circle pad and control pad on the left , buttons on the right			1
the pointing stylus is stored on the right hand side of the @entity4 , rather than on the back with the @entity4			2
the preview @entity4 unit i was using had a matte finish on the exterior instead of the shiny , glossy finish found on the @entity4			2
the larger hand - held console also comes with a 4gb sd card included , twice as big as the @entity68 card with which the @entity4 is outfitted			1
if you are thinking of going large , @entity1 has figured out a way to bring all your games with you			2
data can be transferred from any @entity74 , @entity75 or @entity4 console onto the @entity4 system			0
connection settings , photos , audio and purchased @entity80 can be shuttled to the new console using a internet connection between the two systems			0
@entity80 save data can not be transferred , so be prepared to play those games from scratch if you want to move them over			0
the larger screen and bigger controls make for easier game play , and the slightly increased weight is negligible			1
in fact , the hand - held device feels more stable and sturdy with its extra size			0
i have n't put it through an accidental " drop test " yet , but it seems like it could take a punch			0
the 3 - d screen really has n't changed , which means if it gave you a headache before , it probably will again			0
the longer battery life is very nice , especially for those who play on their way to school or work and have to put it away for a while once arriving			0
" @entity114 " will be the featured game for the new hand - held , coming out on the same day in @entity37 and the @entity40 , but not included with the console			0
the @entity4 shows it off nicely with brilliant colors , fluid motion and responsive controls			2
it is , of course , a @entity120 game , which means lots of jumping and side - scrolling , but it all looks great on bigger screens			0
the @entity125 is everything you are used to in the @entity4 , but it is a larger , stronger package			1
the larger screens make it easier to see action and gives players a bit of finesse on the touch screen			1
right now , the @entity4 is not compatible with the @entity135 controller add - on , but @entity1 said they are planning on releasing one later this year			1
the @entity125 was released on august 19 in @entity136 ( $ 199.99 ) and will debut august 23 in @entity41 ( a $ 249.95 )			2
it is available in @entity37 ( 18,900 yen ) and @entity38 ( 199.99 euros )			0
the highlight colors available at launch will be red and blue for @entity136 ; red , blue and silver for @entity38 and @entity41 ; red , silver and white for @entity37 .			0

@entity1 released the bigger @entity125 on sunday .
the mobile gaming device has a 90 % bigger screen than the *current* @entity4
larger screen , bigger controls make for easier *gameplay*
its @entity15 screen is the same , so if the @entity4 gives you headaches , the @entity12 will too
