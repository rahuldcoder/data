-- the @entity2 - led war against the @entity3 in @entity4 has been a tough slog , a nearly eight - year conflict replete with gloom			1
@entity2 staff sergeant @entity8 secures an area in the @entity11 district of @entity12 on august 22			1
lately a lot of the news from @entity4 seems particularly grim for the @entity2 and its allies			1
more @entity2 troops have been killed there in august than in any month since the war began			1
there are indications that more @entity2 troops could be deployed to the country			1
the @entity4 presidential elections this month were rife with charges of fraud			2
corruption plagues the political system			0
the poppy trade is flourishing			0
and , in the words of the top @entity2 military official , adm. @entity29 , the " @entity3 insurgency has gotten better , more sophisticated			1
" support for the war hit a new low among @entity2 , a @entity0 poll found this month			1
so why do the @entity2 and its allies continue to pour money and troops into @entity4 ? " the importance of the place is pretty substantial , " said @entity37 , senior fellow for foreign policy at the @entity39			1
@entity42 has used that part of the world as a sanctuary , he said			0
neighboring @entity46 has been serious about vanquishing the militants there and that helps the fight against militants in @entity4			2
a victory for @entity42 in a conflict there would represent an important public relations triumph for the militants , he said			0
he understands why @entity2 are displeased but said people need to feel that progress is being made in the region			2
" we have n't been winning for eight years , " @entity37 said			0
" they want to know why			0
" @entity2 president @entity60 has tackled the question head - on			2
the @entity42 and @entity3 militants in @entity4 and @entity46 represent an urgent threat to the @entity2 , he said in march , just as they were when @entity42 attacked the @entity2 in 2001 , when the then - ruling @entity3 harbored the terror network			1
" many people in the @entity2 -- and many in partner countries that have sacrificed so much -- have a simple question : what is our purpose in @entity4 ? " the president said			1
" after so many years , they ask , why do our men and women still fight and die there ? and they deserve a straightforward answer			0
" so let me be clear : @entity42 and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks -- are in @entity46 and @entity4			2
" multiple intelligence estimates have warned that @entity42 is actively planning attacks on the @entity2 homeland from its safe haven in @entity46			2
and if the @entity4 government falls to the @entity3 -- or allows @entity42 to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can			1
" the questions have come up in @entity92 , too , where the deaths of 15 @entity92 troops in july stirred outrage and criticism of @entity92 's strategy in @entity4			1
prime minister @entity98 told his countrymen that @entity92 involvement in that country now is as crucial as it was after the 2001 terrorist attacks			0
" in 2001 the case for intervention in @entity4 was to take on a global terrorist threat and prevent terrorist attacks in @entity92 and across the world , " he said			2
" in 2009 the overriding reason for our continued involvement is the same -- to take on , at its source , the terrorist threat , and prevent attacks here and elsewhere			0
" @entity60 said the @entity4 insurgency " feeds instability " in @entity46 and @entity46 extremists have the proven ability to undermine the @entity4 government			2
he cited the importance of confronting the heroin trade that finances the insurgency			0
@entity60 has listed several objectives in dealing with @entity4 and @entity46 , such as promoting an accountable @entity4 government and self - reliant security forces , developing a stable government and strong economy in @entity46 , and disrupting terror networks			0
@entity46 security forces have been battling militants in the northwestern part of the country , and drone strikes thought to be conducted by the @entity2 have been carried out from @entity4 against militants in @entity46			1
" the future of @entity4 is inextricably linked to the future of its neighbor , @entity46 , " @entity60 said			0
" in the nearly eight years since 9/11 , @entity42 and its extremist allies have moved across the border to the remote areas of the @entity46 frontier			0
" this almost certainly includes @entity42 's leadership : @entity143 and @entity144			0
they have used this mountainous terrain as a safe haven to hide , to train terrorists , to communicate with followers , to plot attacks , and to send fighters to support the insurgency in @entity4			1
for the @entity2 people , this border region has become the most dangerous place in the world			0
" in @entity92 , @entity98 said the military effort to clear a region and establish security would be buttressed by @entity4 plans " to build basic services -- clean water , electricity , roads , basic justice , basic health care , and then economic development			2
" " this inevitably takes time , but the important thing is that work has begun , to give the people a stake in the future , " he said			0
@entity2 sen. @entity174 , @entity176 - @entity175 , said in a recent tv interview that he has " a lot of concerns about the way we 've articulated our national goals in @entity4			1
" " i think that it is extremely important for us to be able to articulate the end point of our strategy , just as it was in @entity187 , " he said			0
while there is grim news on the ground in @entity4 , the picture painted by the president in march was a red alert for @entity2 : it 's a tough but necessary fight that requires patience and resources			1
" there are no quick fixes to achieve @entity2 national security interests in @entity4 and @entity46 , " @entity60 said			1
" the danger of failure is real and the implications are grave			0
