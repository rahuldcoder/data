@entity2 says " cuspers " are staking out a separate identity from the baby boomer generation			1
@entity17 ( @entity13 ) -- rarely has there been a year when so many things went out of style in such a short time : not just investment bankers , gas - guzzling vehicles , corporate jets , conspicuous consumption and political polarization , but also a whole generation			2
after strutting and tub - thumping and preening their way across the high ground of politics , media , culture and finance for 30 years , baby boomers have gone from top dogs to scapegoats in barely a year			1
as baby boomers lose their authority and appeal , generational power is shifting one notch down : to cuspers ( born roughly 1954 - 1965 ) , who arrived in style in 2008 with their first truly major figure , @entity47 ( born 1961 )			1
@entity48 , born in 1946 at the start of the postwar baby boom for which his generation is named , will leave office with the lowest approval ratings since @entity54 was president			1
as @entity55 has written , @entity48 epitomizes what 's now seen as " the @entity57			0
" who 's to blame for the economy going into serious decline ? the short and easy answer is greedy boomers			2
this is the generation that knew better than their cautious , fuddy - duddy parents , the generation that protested , that had ideals and marched to the beat of defiant music : " @entity71 , " " we want the @entity72 and we want it now , " " @entity63			2
" it 's the generation that pursued pleasure , proclaimed " i can have it all " and refused to grow old -- " 50 is the new 30 , " etc. and now , after years of taking credit for changing the world , baby boomers are taking the rap for the reversal of fortune that 's shaking the world			1
whatever history may decide , today 's commentators and pundits of all ages have decided that boomers , the dominant cohort in many developed countries , are guilty			2
and whether they 're really to blame , what counts is that they look like they are			0
like a big - name @entity98 director who 's lived on the edge too long , caused one too many scandals and made one too many turkeys , suddenly the boomers are the generation no one wants to be associated with			1
@entity105 , the age cohort that have been living in the shadow of the boomers , now have even more reasons to stake out their own separate identity and values			2
it 's taken a long time for this rising demographic to be recognized as a distinct generation in its own right			2
they 've been called " late boomers " because they missed the formative boomer experiences of the ' 60s , such as civil rights and anti-war protests			1
they 've been called tweeners or cuspers because they straddle the divide between boomers and gen @entity130 social commentator @entity129 has worked hard to establish their identity as @entity132			1
there 's still debate about whether cuspers are even a generation apart from boomers and where the generational boundaries lie			1
but those arguments miss the key point , which is that @entity141 want change			0
in @entity47 , they see the hopeful prospect of a new generation taking over			1
and in these dark days , they 're hoping against hope that his generation can usher in new , better values to guide the nation			0
his victory has been portrayed as the end of @entity156 politics and the 1960s " culture wars			1
" about half those @entity47 named to major posts in the new administration are also cuspers including the proposed energy czar , education secretary , treasury secretary and @entity165 ambassador			1
@entity105 may have another poster child if @entity167 , born in 1957 , is named to the @entity169 seat that @entity170 is expected to vacate			0
@entity47 himself has made clear he thinks in terms of generational difference			1
he has spoken of carrying on the work of the " @entity176 generation " -- the @entity177 generation -- whose successors he has referred to as the " @entity181 generation			0
" his activists rallied under the banner of @entity184 , and his campaign 's ability to mobilize the youth vote proved decisive in his victory			0
whether we call them cuspers , @entity132 or @entity184 , there are enigmas and paradoxes within this generation and its fans			1
they respond to @entity196 imagery , but they 're not dogmatic in their faith			0
they value traditional notions of family but see men and women as equals in parenting			0
they go back to older @entity141 values -- civility , community , responsibility -- yet keenly embrace technology and use the internet naturally			0
in fact , embracing digital technology is one of the telling dividers between boomers and cuspers			1
it 's no coincidence that leading - edge @entity105 such as @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 , all born in 1955 , helped create the digital universe cuspers and younger generations now inhabit as a matter of course			0
it 's also telling that @entity221 and wife , @entity231 , another cusper , are the parents of philanthro - capitalism			0
for marketers and brand specialists , cuspers are a fast - emerging challenger brand that 's fascinating to watch as it defines itself and attracts fans			0
brand attributes once seen as disadvantages -- living in the shadow of boomers , a lack of major formative experiences , no " heroic " narrative -- have turned out to be advantages as the boomer brand loses its sheen			0
the cusper brand can define itself by what it 's not : greedy , selfish , confrontational , hung up on past battles			0
the cusper generation is as much an ideal as it is a demographic group , and that appeal extends well beyond the birth years that define it			2
watch out for tweets ( messages on the @entity263 platform ) that proclaim " ich bin ein cusper			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : for 30 years , baby boomers dominated politics , culture
she says they 've earned the title of the " greediest generation "
@entity2 says next generation of " cuspers " is taking over with @entity47
the cuspers are different and unlikely to *repeat* boomers ' mistakes , she says
