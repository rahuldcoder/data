the story has all the traits of a career - ending political scandal : a congressman who recently snagged a top position in party leadership faces accusations that he addressed a hate group run by a notorious white supremacist			1
and all of that , just a week before his party is set to take the reigns of power in @entity12			0
but the fast rising career of @entity15 rep. @entity15 , who was tapped as @entity16 this summer , may not be in the ditches just yet			1
there 's a lot to keep track of			0
here 's what you need to know : so what happened ? it turns out @entity15 addressed an anti-semitic , white supremacist group back in 2002 run by none other than @entity29 , a former grand wizard of the @entity30 who is well - known in @entity15 's home state of @entity32 because of several statewide campaigns for governor and senator			1
a liberal @entity32 politics blogger revealed the encounter with the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) after finding an account of @entity15 's speech to the group on a white supremacist forum			1
the group is bad news for @entity15 : it 's been labeled as a hate group by the @entity46 , which details the group 's anti-semitic , racist views			2
the next day , reporters in @entity50 were asking @entity15 's office about the meeting and after aides first said it was " probable " and then " likely " the congressman spoke to the group , @entity15 broke his silence in an interview with his local paper , @entity58 of @entity59			1
he said he did n't remember specifically addressing @entity38 , but said that at the time he " went and spoke to any group that called " in 2002 when he was trying to drum up support in opposing a state tax plan			2
and then @entity15 released the ultimate mea culpa statement tuesday afternoon , calling his appearance at the event " a mistake i regret			0
" " one of the many groups that i spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views i wholeheartedly condemn			0
it was a mistake i regret , " @entity15 said			0
democrats must be eager to disrupt the @entity76 leadership			1
so given his admission , why is n't he at greater risk of losing his leadership position ? @entity76 have a lot at stake here and just months after solidifying a new leadership and days before taking on new - found power in @entity50 , keeping @entity15 in the ranks as whip is the ideal for @entity76 leaders			1
and details of @entity15 's appearance at the hate group 's forum are n't giving too much credence to the theory that @entity15 is a closeted bigot			1
and @entity15 is touting his catholic faith as a reason he would n't associate with white supremacists			2
they do n't usually like @entity100 either			0
with only one aide on his staff , @entity15 conceded the regular vetting process fell through			0
and @entity104 , a longtime advisor to @entity105 , said he invited @entity106 ( who was his neighbor at the time ) personally and insisted in an interview with the @entity110 that " i do n't think @entity15 knew anything about @entity38			2
" @entity104 said he and @entity106 were friendly and @entity15 knew him as the head of " our civic association , " but that they " would n't talk about race or the @entity117 question			2
" sounds like the dots would n't have been too hard for @entity15 to connect given @entity105 's notoriety			1
how could @entity15 survive this scandal ? while national @entity74 have their targets set on @entity15 -- including one statement from @entity126 @entity74 ' campaign arm that " @entity15 chose to cheerlead for a group of @entity30 members and neo-nazis " -- @entity15 is getting some much - needed relief from a diverse group of fellow @entity32 politicos			1
the state 's @entity133 gov. @entity133 was quick to fire off a statement calling @entity15 " a good man " and expressing his confidence that @entity15 " absolutely rejects racism in all its forms			2
" and democrats from the bayou state also rose to @entity15 's defense			1
@entity144 rep. @entity143 , who will be the only @entity145 from the state serving in @entity12 starting next week , jumped to @entity15 's defense and said he would not " let them use @entity15 as a scapegoat to score political points			1
" former @entity32 gov. @entity150 told the @entity151 " sometimes you end up in front of these groups through no fault of your own " and the state 's former sen. @entity156 said he knows @entity15 did n't mean to address the white supremacist group			1
" while it is sometimes fun to see @entity76 in trouble , you 'd be wrong to blame representative @entity15 for being racist on account of addressing a meeting of @entity165 ' in 2002 , " @entity156 , who is now a lobbyist in @entity50 , said in a statement			1
" i know a lot about @entity29 , who ran against me for the @entity167 in 1990 , but i never knew that the ' @entity38 ' was a racist organization			0
i may disagree with @entity106 but a racist he is not			0
nor would he have been stupid enough to knowingly address a racist group			0
" what about @entity76 leadership ? are they putting a little skin in the game to save their pal ? it looks that way			2
after about a day and a half of scrutiny and speculation , @entity15 's superiors in the @entity126 @entity76 leadership showed their support for their now - embattled whip			1
house speaker @entity183 said in a statement @entity15 has his " full confidence " as whip despite making " an error in judgment , " followed shortly by a similar statement by his no. 2 , rep. @entity190			2
@entity15 brings back @entity183 's familiar right flank hangover but wait , are n't there some questions about whether @entity15 actually even attended the event , after all ? remember @entity104 's account to the @entity110 about the event ? @entity104 has since changed his story considerably in his latest interviews with several media outlets			1
@entity104 told @entity200 that @entity15 actually spoke to the local civic association in the same hotel space as the @entity38 meeting , before that meeting started			0
and in subsequent interviews with other reporters , details in @entity104 's recollection of the event 12 years ago have cropped up or changed			0
is there anything else we should know about @entity15 's past in regards to race relations ? @entity15 voted twice against making martin luther king , jr. day a state holiday in 1999 and 2004 as a state legislator			0
and in 1997 he voted against a bill prohibiting hate crimes based on race , class or sexual orientation , @entity219 reported			0
@entity15 is and has clearly been aware of @entity29 's white supremacist views , but that 's not what he pointed to as the " first and most important thing " in a 1999 interview with @entity230 about why @entity105 would n't make a good congressional candidate			1
" the novelty of @entity29 has worn off , " @entity15			0
" the voters in this district are smart enough to realize that they need to get behind someone who not only believes in the issues they care about , but also can get elected			0
@entity105 has proven that he ca n't get elected , and that 's the first and most important thing			0
" and @entity59 advocate politics blogger @entity239 says that @entity15 once told her he was like @entity29 without the baggage .			0

rep. @entity15 is the @entity16 and a @entity76 from @entity32
he 's *embroiled* in a scandal after it was reported he spoke at a @entity247 supremacist gathering
leadership and some *homestate* pols have continued to support him
national democrats however are n't showing any signs of letting this *incident* go
