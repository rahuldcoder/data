-- @entity1 wants @entity2 to believe that she made difficult decisions as secretary of state			1
that 's the premise of her new book , " @entity7			2
" somehow , i suspect that if @entity10 had a do - over for this week 's @entity0 town hall , she might choose not to field a hard question from @entity14			1
a professor at the @entity17 at @entity18 , @entity15 asked @entity20 's former top diplomat about president @entity22 's record of removing the undocumented and splitting up families with such efficiency that , as @entity15 noted , many @entity26 call @entity22 the " deporter in chief			2
" he asked what @entity10 would do differently			2
the likely 2016 presidential candidate started by declaring her support for " comprehensive immigration reform " because undocumented immigrants who are " raising families and working hard and contributing to our country deserve a path to citizenship			1
" so far , so good			0
she went on : " i also think that we have to understand the difficulty that president @entity22 finds himself in because there are laws that impose certain obligations on him			2
" @entity10 does n't seem to understand how much discretion the executive branch has -- in immigration enforcement -- to set policy , shape priorities , and decide who stays or goes			1
after arguing with immigration reform advocates from 2009 to 2011 that he was powerless to stop deportations , @entity22 himself -- in a gesture intended to woo @entity26 voters during the 2012 election -- flexed his executive power when he announced a change in policy by the @entity60 that allowed some young undocumented immigrants to avoid deportations and obtain work permits			1
under @entity22 , @entity60 imposed quotas for apprehensions , the @entity66 reported , and roped local police officers into enforcing immigration laws as a force multiplier			0
the executive branch was n't some spectator to the deportation juggernaut ; it was the driving force			1
should n't a former member of the @entity75 know this ? @entity10 also said that it was her understanding that " the numbers have been moderating in part as the @entity60 and other law enforcement officials understood that separating children from families -- i mean , the horror of a father or a mother going to work and being picked up and immediately whisked away and children coming home from school to an empty house and nobody can say where their mother or father is -- that is just not who we are as @entity2			1
" apparently , @entity10 does n't know many immigration lawyers			1
the dozen or so that i know -- who give me updates about their battles to stop clients from being deported -- would not agree that the numbers of deportations are " moderating			0
" there are still just under 400,000 per year			0
wrapping up her answer , she went on to say : " we need to show humanity with respect to people who are working , contributing right now			0
and deporting them , leaving their children alone or deporting an adolescent , doing anything that is so contrary to our core values , just makes no sense			0
" yet , as secretary of state , @entity10 sat at the @entity75 table for four years alongside homeland security secretary @entity121 -- who went before @entity122 to brag about the number of deportations and promise to raise it			1
and she did n't say anything then ? you know , in defense of humanity ? right about then , @entity10 strayed off message			1
when @entity0 's @entity132 asked her what she would do about the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors from @entity20 who are coming across the @entity2 - @entity138 border , @entity10 at first tried to duck the question by talking about everything from violence in @entity20 to the need to provide emergency care to children who cross the border			1
fortunately , @entity132 pursued an answer			0
after asking the question -- whether these children should stay or be sent back home -- four different times , she finally got one			0
" well , " @entity10 said , " they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are , because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back			2
but i think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families			0
" it 's not that simple			0
according to media reports , many of these young people came to the @entity2 to be reunited with parents and other family members			0
what do we do with them ? separate more families ? did n't @entity10 herself just say that this approach " makes no sense " ? finally , having painted herself into a corner , she took a hard line			1
opinion : does @entity1 have to be so boring ? " we have to send a clear message : just because your child gets across the border , that does n't mean the child gets to stay , " she said			1
" so , we do n't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey			2
" what world is @entity10 living in ? when a child crosses the border , of course he or she gets to stay			2
that has long been the unspoken policy of @entity2 immigration officials , under administrations in both parties			0
they ca n't just send these minors back across the border to be abused , assaulted , or worse			0
instead , they 're locked up for a couple of days and then released with a notice to appear before an immigration judge , which most of them ignore			0
as for encouraging more people to come , that is precisely what conservatives predict will happen if we ever pass the kind of comprehensive immigration reform that @entity10 claims to support			2
is this her roundabout way of saying she agrees with them ? we already knew that @entity22 had flunked immigration			0
@entity10 's comments this week suggest that she finds the subject just as challenging .			1

@entity223 says @entity1 does n't seem to understand immigration issues
he says her answer at @entity229 started out ok but strayed off message
as former @entity75 member , she should know executive branch power , he says
@entity223 : @entity10 said she 's *sympathetic* to immigrant families , but then took hard line
