news articles , social media posts and images about @entity4 's pro-democracy protests are being heavily censored behind @entity6 notorious firewall			1
@entity6 state - run news outlets have largely ignored the pro-democracy protests except for the same @entity10 story in which the @entity4 chief executive @entity11 denounced the demonstrations as " unlawful			1
" @entity11 : raw emotion ' will get us nowhere ' in @entity4 , residents have poured into the streets to defy @entity18 's vision for its political future in the midst of its longest series of political protests since the 1997 handover			1
their goal is to pressure @entity6 into giving the former @entity27 colony full universal suffrage			0
dozens have been reported injured by authorities			0
on the social media front , @entity31 has been blocked in @entity6 since sunday			1
users can not view images and a message reads on the site : " ca n't refresh feed			0
" @entity6 observers noted that while the app ca n't be accessed in @entity6 for most , the country 's first lady @entity40 's official @entity31 account posted a picture of her and her husband , @entity6 's president @entity44 , on monday			1
the photo app has been viewed as a relatively non-political social media platform , said @entity47 , an assistant professor at the @entity48			2
" in the past two days , we can see a lot of people holding phones and taking pictures of different ( @entity4 protest ) scenes on @entity31 , @entity56 and sharing it around , " he said			2
" it 's a huge amount of pictures posted in a short period of time			0
" that may have led to the blocking of the photo - sharing app , @entity47 said			0
the @entity6 government maintains strict controls over what can be seen on the @entity68 and social media			1
this firewall extends to @entity56 , @entity71 and @entity72 , and @entity73 is rarely accessible			0
@entity4 does not fall under the same restrictions			0
@entity6 's massively popular microblogging site , @entity75 is being censored at the highest rate this year with " @entity4 " as the most commonly deleted term , according to @entity78 , a @entity48 effort that monitors deleted posts			1
about 152 out of 10,000 @entity75 posts were blocked , said @entity47 , who also works on @entity82			0
why @entity6 censors @entity4 demonstrations photos of police confronting young pro-democracy protesters are sensitive in @entity6 , because it 's a reminder of @entity89 , in which @entity6 authorities cracked down on student protesters on june 4 , 1989 , @entity47 said			1
" if you look at the political agenda of protests in @entity4 , they have the same objectives			2
they 're calling for democracy in @entity4 and political reform			2
these are two main sensitive topics in @entity6			0
this is the topic they do n't want the @entity6 citizens to widely discuss , " he said			0
but @entity6 can not completely black out any knowledge of the @entity4 protests , especially with 40 million mainland arrivals to the special administrative region every year			1
@entity6 authorities can not control whether its citizens know about pro-democracy @entity4 protests , but they can shut down " autonomous communication space " where public discussions can take place in @entity6 , said @entity113 , an adjunct professor for the @entity114 at the @entity115			1
" that 's what they 're trying to repress , " he said			0
" the @entity6 government fears that the kinds of protest and exercise of rights demanding greater political freedom will be contagious and trigger something in @entity6 , " he said			1
" that 's what they fear the most			0
" what you can see in @entity6 the protest intensified sunday when @entity4 police unleashed tear gas on demonstrators			2
but there was no mention of it on the evening @entity6 state - run cctv news			0
on monday morning , the homepage of @entity6 's major portals such as @entity142 , @entity143 , 163 and @entity6 's state - run news agency @entity10 did not mention the events either			1
searches on @entity6 's top search engine sites such as @entity148 and @entity149 for the terms " @entity4 protest " or even " @entity4 students " yielded irrelevant results such as stories showing a a blissful image of @entity4 residents picnicking on the grass or how @entity4 is welcoming tourists from the mainland during the national holiday week			1
when relevant results appeared on the @entity6 search engines , the articles contained a distinctively @entity165 slant and even surfaced a month - old article about a small @entity168 counter-protest in @entity4			2
content that was more sympathetic to @entity4 protesters had been removed with messages reading : " in accordance with relevant laws , regulations and policies , search results could not be displayed			0

@entity6 's news and social media are *stripped* of discussions on @entity4 protests
@entity6 fears discussion of political rights , dissent and civil *disobedience* , observers say
@entity31 has been blocked since sunday when protests heated up
