-- @entity2 and @entity3 's decision to skip the @entity4 at @entity5 in may has been defended by their manager @entity6			1
world number one @entity2 and @entity9 's rising star @entity3 are giving the tournament , dubbed the " fifth major " a wide berth , saying it did not fit their schedules			1
both have opted to take up @entity16 membership in 2011 , meaning they can only play three events on the @entity18 outside of the majors			0
@entity6 told @entity0 that moving the @entity18 's flagship tournament from just before the @entity21 to a slot in may had prompted the decisions of his star duo			1
" i would think when it was played at the end of the march it was getting to be the fifth major , " said @entity6			2
" moving it to the middle of may has made it about the 10th most important tournament in the world			0
" it is n't a priority for them as they would rather win a major or a world golf championship event , " he added			0
the absence of current world number one @entity2 from the @entity4 has been seen as a snub to the @entity18 , but @entity6 says it is purely down to the calendar			1
" they can not play every week , " he said			0
@entity3 has also denied reports of a rift with @entity18 commissioner @entity47 for abandoning the @entity49 circuit after only one year as a full - time member			2
he wrote on his @entity52 blog : " for everyone who is interested , the reason i 'm not playing @entity4 this year is because i 've never thought the golf course has set up that well for me			2
" hence , two missed cuts in two years			0
i have no sort of vendetta against @entity47 or the @entity18 ; i love playing in the @entity49 and have always found the people very welcoming			0
" @entity61 's @entity60 won last year 's @entity4 , with @entity2 finishing tied for fourth , four shots behind .			1
