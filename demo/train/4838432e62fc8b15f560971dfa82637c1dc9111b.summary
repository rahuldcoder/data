, you can for a moment forget that you 're in @entity4			1
beautiful buildings , walkways , flowerbeds and even a grass soccer pitch			2
@entity9 is said to be behind the law			1
young men and women , dressed in @entity14 attire , walk around freely and with smiles			1
smiles are a bit of a rarity in today 's @entity19 , a polluted city of survival and despair , so this was both shocking and refreshing to me			0
we did n't have an appointment but we were hoping to interview @entity9 , a conservative @entity26 cleric			1
he is said to be the man behind the controversial @entity26 state law , a law critics say strips @entity26 women of many rights			1
while security was checking our bags , one guard said that @entity9 had been waiting for us			1
i tried explaining that we did not have an appointment			0
nonetheless , we were sent back to where @entity9 was waiting			1
before entering the room i was cautioned by a guard to make sure none of my hair was showing below my headscarf			0
they were apologetic ; one even asked me to zip up my sweater higher because too much of my neck was exposed			0
i complied , tucking in my hair and zipping my sweater as high as it could go			0
now paranoid about the design holes in my scarf that exposed parts of my hair , i took off my shoes to enter			0
as we walked in , @entity9 , an older man with a white beard wearing a @entity26 - style turban called a " dulband " was sitting on a brown couch			1
he looked at the two men who brought us in and said , " these are n't the two i was waiting for			2
" i explained that we just showed up for an interview because we did not have a number to reach him			0
he smiled and said , " i guess you are in luck			0
" @entity9 welcomed us and asked me to translate his warm welcome to our @entity65 cameraman			1
as the interview started , i noticed that @entity9 avoided my eyes			1
i wondered if it was because i was female			0
i was also prepared for verbal attacks ; a journalist friend told me that when he brought a western journalist to interview @entity9 a few days ago , the journalist ended up having more questions thrown at him than he was able to ask			1
but it did n't take long for @entity9 to warm up and explain why @entity26 state law is just and a part of @entity14			1
those who do n't agree do n't understand it , he said			0
" the law ... which i created i see as correct for both men and women , " he said			1
" we have given rights to both men and women , even better than rights given to women in the @entity88			1
we give women more in this law			1
" i asked him about reports that if a woman does not comply in having sexual relations with her husband , then the husband can refuse to feed her			0
" yes , i said that , " @entity9 said looking me in the eye			1
" when a couple marries , sex is a part of marriage , and they agree to that			0
" he went on to explain that a woman is n't obliged to have sexual relations every single night or if she is told by her doctor to refrain			0
but otherwise it is her obligation and something she signed up for when she got married			0
he calls it the wife 's duty			0
@entity9 added that a wife wearing makeup " prevents a man from thinking about other women on the streets and he can just think of his wife			1
" he continued : " it is natural that women ( wear makeup )			2
do n't they in the @entity88 ? their women wear it on the streets and in shops			2
women should put make - up on for their husbands as it will increase the love and attraction between the two			2
" the cleric also explained that a woman is not required to ask the permission of a man to leave the house if she has a job and needs to go to work			2
but they do need to get permission if they are leaving for other reasons			0
more importantly , he said , a couple needs to make clear the day they marry whether or not she will need permission to leave the home			0
if they disagree then they should not get married			0
" like , you are working for @entity0 , " he said			0
" if your boss tells you , you 'll be working for 8 hours a day , then you 're responsible for that			0
it 's the same here			0
they both have to agree on it			0
" according to @entity9 , the @entity88 is imposing its beliefs on the @entity14 world because they do n't understand			1
however , it 's not just people in the @entity88 who are opposed to this law			2
many @entity4 , men and women , have vehemently resisted it			1
they fear it will set women back after the progress that has been made in the last seven years			2
@entity169 , head of @entity4 's @entity170 , has been working for a year now , trying to amend certain articles within the law			1
i do n't feel equal in this country , " she told us			0
@entity169 said the law does not represent @entity14			1
it blatantly contradicts the constitution of @entity4 , which states that men and women are equal			1
critics have labeled the law as " @entity184 , " but @entity169 says even many of the @entity187 's actions were not enshrined in law			1
she admitted that a law for @entity190 is necessary but that it should be what is stated in @entity192 or @entity192			2
" one of the very important pillars in @entity14 is justice , there is no justice in this law , " she said			1
@entity169 also pointed out the absurdities in the law , such as the edict on makeup			2
" if she does n't ( put on make - up ) , will the husband go complain to the police that she did n't put ( on ) the lipstick ? or , ' i like red but she put on pink			0
' " however , @entity169 did n't blame the clerics alone for creating the new law ; she blamed various parts of the government for allowing it to pass			2
" i think they -- all of them -- took the whole issue very superficially			0
and none of the state institutions , ministry of justice , parliament , senate and the office of the president , really did n't look at the law as serious as they should , " she said .			2
