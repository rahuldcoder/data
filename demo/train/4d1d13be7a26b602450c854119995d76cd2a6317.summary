-- may 11 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : what you 've learned in government and civics classes is unfolding right now on @entity19			2
how the lessons apply in life -- our first story on @entity24 ! first up : @entity25 @entity26 : @entity27 is a name you 're going to be hearing in the weeks ahead			1
she is the solicitor - general -- the @entity31 administration 's top lawyer			1
it 's her job to argue cases for the government at the @entity35 @entity25			1
president @entity31 now wants her to serve on that court ; @entity27 is the president 's top choice to replace retiring @entity40 @entity39			1
@entity35 president @entity31 : while we ca n't presume to replace @entity39 ' wisdom or experience i have selected a nominee who i believe embodies that same excellence , independence , integrity and passion for the law and who can ultimately provide that same kind of leadership on the court			1
@entity26 : but as you know from your government classes , president @entity31 ca n't just give her the job			1
he needs the " advice and consent " of the @entity63 , who 'll make the final decision on @entity27			2
they 'll be looking at her resume : her law degree from @entity70			2
her work as dean of that university 's law school			1
her service as a lawyer for the former @entity77 administration			2
but one major concern for some senators : @entity27 has no experience as a judge , unlike all the current members of the @entity25			1
so she 's likely to face some tough questions from senators ; they 're going to be trying to get an idea of how she would rule in certain situations before they decide whether or not to confirm her			1
if the 50 - year - old @entity90 gets the job as associate justice , she would be the fourth woman to serve in the history of the @entity25			1
@entity94 @entity26 : while @entity96 considers different ways to stop and clean up an oil spill in the @entity99 , other folks are trying to help out			1
their livelihood depends on it			2
@entity102 shows us how dirty a job the clean - up is			1
and you 're going to hear him mention " @entity107 " -- that 's a reference to the @entity109 , a ship that spilled 11 million gallons of oil near @entity112 back in 1989			1
( begin video ) @entity102 , @entity114 : clearing the oil is a big job , and the pros ca n't do it alone			1
@entity118 : this is a safety training class			2
@entity120 : so the call has gone out to recruit the locals			2
@entity118 : if you 're going to be working in contaminated water , you 'll have to have boots -- rubber boots			2
@entity120 : hundreds have already volunteered to help and safety trainings like this one are being held across the coast			0
@entity131 , @entity132 : why are they getting volunteers when they have contractors ? @entity120 : a reminder that cleaning up oil is a dangerous job			1
@entity139 : hearing today , the type of equipment you have to wear to pick up trash off the beach , was a realization that this is real and it 's happening			1
@entity120 : some volunteers who pitched in after the @entity109 spill are still sick			1
due to financial settlements , many ca n't even talk publicly about their health problems , but it is bad			0
@entity152 , @entity153 : they have long - term effects , some central nervous system effects and who 's to say we wo n't see that here			1
it think it 's just going to be a wait - and - see game			1
@entity120 : @entity162 is on the frontlines at @entity165 's @entity164 where preparations are already underway			1
some of @entity162 's first patients could be these fishermen			1
normally , these boats would be out trying to net some shrimp			0
but the oil spill has put a stop to that , so they sit and they wait			1
some of these boats may actually be out working for @entity96 trying to clean up the mess			1
@entity118 : @entity96 's here to ask for your help			1
@entity120 : @entity96 is already holding informational sessions			0
@entity182 attended , and now wants a long - term contract to clean up			1
he runs two shrimp boats that now sit idle			0
@entity185 , @entity186 : unpredictable for the future of the shrimp business and shrimp industry , we need to get some sort of financing income from somewhere			0
@entity120 : the @entity194 performs safety checks before each vessel is approved for duty			0
safety for the boat , but what about the crew ? @entity202 , fisherman : we 're worried about that too , but working and we 've got to do it , you know ? you got to take risks on that			0
@entity120 : so you need the money so you just start doing it ? @entity213 : yes , sir			0
( @entity214 ) @entity215 @entity216 , @entity14 : see if you can id me ! my goals include freedom and peace for almost 500 million citizens			0
i 'm a partnership of 27 @entity224 countries			0
i have one official currency : the euro			0
i 'm the @entity228 , and my main trading partner is the @entity35 @entity230 @entity26 : all right , so you get an idea from that how the economies of @entity224 and @entity35 are linked together			0
take what 's happened in @entity235			1
it has huge debt -- money it owes that some investors are worried it may not be able to repay			0
because that 's bad for @entity224 -- and @entity224 has that close trading partnership with the @entity35 -- the @entity35 stock market dropped last week , after @entity235 's bad news			1
well , here 's some better news			1
the @entity228 has just come up with a new plan to deal with @entity224 debt			0
it 's set aside almost a trillion dollars to stabilize and protect @entity224 's economies			1
and that has investors in @entity35 , and around the world , breathing a sigh of relief			0
as proof , the @entity254 -- part of the @entity35 stock market -- jumped up hundreds of points yesterday			0
@entity260 @entity26 : @entity6 will be getting a new leader			0
its current prime minister , @entity262 , whom you see right here -- he 's asking his political party -- the @entity266 -- to get ready for a new leadership contest			1
but he wo n't be a candidate			0
this is all because of @entity6 's election last week			1
three of @entity6 's political parties shared most of the vote			2
but none of them got enough votes , to form a government on its own			0
so it looks like two of them will have to get together , form an alliance to get leadership in place			0
which two parties that will be has n't been decided yet			0
but what 's interesting about all this is that an election like this has n't happened in @entity6 since 1974			2
@entity289 @entity290 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity293 's students at @entity294 in @entity295 , @entity296 ! where would you find @entity299 ? you know what to do ! is it in : a ) @entity303 , b ) @entity90 , c ) @entity304 ) @entity305 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a historically black university , @entity307 is located in @entity303 ! that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity311 @entity26 : speaking at a graduation ceremony at @entity299 , president @entity31 talked about the importance of education			1
it 's hard for anybody to disagree with that : the national unemployment rate is at 9.9 percent			2
the president pointed out that the rate is more than twice as high for people without a college degree than it is for those with a college degree			2
what might cause more disagreement , though , is what the president had to say about certain types of technology			2
@entity31 : this class is graduating at a time of great difficulty for @entity35 and for the world			0
you 're entering a job market , in an era of heightened international competition , with an economy that 's still rebounding from the worst crisis since the @entity343			1
you 're accepting your degrees as @entity35 still wages two wars ; wars that many in your generation have been fighting			0
and meanwhile , you 're coming of age in a 24/7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content and exposes us to all kinds of arguments , some of which do n't always rank that high on the truth meter			0
and with ipods and @entity363 ; and @entity364 and @entity365 ; none of which i know how to work ; information becomes a distraction , a diversion , a form of entertainment , rather than a tool of empowerment , rather than the means of emancipation			0
so all of this is not only putting pressure on you ; it 's putting new pressure on our country and on our democracy			2
@entity382 @entity26 : okay , it 's your turn			2
we want to know what you think about this			0
not everyone has an @entity363 or an @entity388 , but we 've almost all played video games			0
you 've grown up with computers in your classes , many of you			0
do you agree with the president that the information you get from these things is a distraction ? or do you think you learn something from them ? talk to us today at @entity399 ! we 're looking forward to seeing what you have to say			1
before we go @entity26 : when i told a friend today that our last story was about clogging , she wanted to know what people were clogging			2
in this case , shoes ! the event may not feature the fanciest of footwork			0
but when it comes to sheer numbers , it stomped the old record -- that was 425 people dancing for less than five minutes			0
this , this event , included more than 2,500 stepped out for more than six minutes			0
they clogged the streets with victory			0
goodbye @entity26 : ... that all depended on de-feet			0
with that foot - note , we 're stepping away til tomorrow			0
i 'm @entity427 , and i 'm just gon na put a sock in it .			0
