@entity0 , @entity1 -- wednesday 's convention programming followed tuesday 's standard script : red meat for the base in the early hours , capped off with a slightly sweeter offering in prime time for independent consumption			2
but there was nothing routine about @entity13 's speech			1
the 48 - minute address -- nearly 3,200 words of prepared text and a thousand more of classic @entity13 riffs -- checked off nearly every item on the @entity21 campaign 's wish list : appeal to the persuadable who cite bipartisanship as a key quality : @entity13 praised @entity27			1
he even got an arena - full of loyal @entity30 to cheer @entity31			2
@entity32 : now it 's up to @entity21 " through my foundation , in @entity34 and around the world , i work with @entity30 , @entity37 and independents who are focused on solving problems and seizing opportunities , not fighting each other , " @entity13 said			1
" when times are tough , constant conflict may be good politics but in the real world , cooperation works better			1
" @entity47 without alienating bipartisanship - worshipping swing voters : heading into wednesday , @entity13 's presidential record and his assessment of @entity47 had played a starring role in campaign ads.			1
. for the @entity37 nominee			0
both members of the @entity37 ticket have maximized that advantage by singing @entity13 's praises on the trail			1
but the risk for @entity47 had been that in highlighting and praising @entity13 's judgment , he invested in it a legitimacy that gave @entity13 's attacks wednesday even more potency			1
@entity13 's toughest punches came wrapped in silk gloves ; his most brutal critiques were paired with a side of smiles , jokes and ad libs -- the sort of delivery that allows an attack line to resonate far beyond the base			1
@entity76 in @entity77 , misses husband 's speech push back on the @entity37 's welfare attack : despite near - universal pans from fact - checkers who have repeatedly found the claim that @entity21 has gutted the work requirement for welfare a false one , @entity37 and @entity30 consultants alike had concluded @entity47 campaign 's summer push on that front had begun paying real dividends			1
enter the man who signed the original 1996 welfare reform bill into law			0
" this is personal to me , " @entity13 said			1
but i am telling you the claim that president @entity21 weakened welfare reform 's work requirement is just not true			2
but they keep on running ads claiming it			0
you want to know why ? their campaign pollster said , ' we are not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact - checkers			2
' " the @entity47 campaign made a gamble with its @entity13 praise			1
wednesday was a case study in the inherent pitfalls of that sort of approach			0
cast @entity21 as his ideological heir and most likely to bring back the @entity13 boom years : @entity13 acknowledged the sluggish recovery but drew a direct parallel to his own presidency : " i experienced the same thing in 1994 and early 1995			1
our policies were working and the economy was growing but most people did n't feel it yet , " he said			0
" by 1996 , the economy was roaring , halfway through the longest peacetime expansion in @entity34 history			0
" @entity21 was starting with a much weaker economy , he said -- and " no president " could repair the damage in a single term			0
" but he has the foundation for a new modern , successful economy of prosperity			0
if you renew the president 's contract , you will feel it			0
" in other words : an @entity21 second - term economy would look a lot like mine			0
@entity21 has used some variation of that theme in his stump speech for months			0
but @entity13 was able to draw a straighter line between their records			2
@entity37 strategist and @entity2 contributor @entity151 dubbed it " the moment that probably re-elected @entity21			0
" @entity21 to speak after forceful @entity13 endorsement			2

*ex-president* 's 48 - minute speech , much of it ad - libbed , was classic @entity13
@entity13 promoted the value of bipartisanship in getting things done in the real world
he was able to *re-frame* @entity47 without alienating swing voters
