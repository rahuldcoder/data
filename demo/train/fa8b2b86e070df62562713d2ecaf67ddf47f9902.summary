@entity0 , @entity1 -- both @entity0 and @entity3 say that @entity5 forces are massing in large numbers near @entity1 's eastern border -- and that they represent a threat to @entity1 and potentially to other former @entity10 states			1
it 's hard to pin down an exact figure , amid a welter of different views , but the @entity15 and @entity1 agree the number of @entity5 soldiers present has risen fast in recent weeks			1
@entity5 , meanwhile , says it is simply conducting exercises in its southern and western military regions			0
it said one battalion was pulled back from a border area monday after completing those drills , but @entity24 says it can not confirm any withdrawal			1
here 's what the different parties are saying about the apparent @entity5 troop buildup : @entity15 : @entity5 may have as many as 40,000 troops near its western border with @entity1 , two @entity15 officials said last week			1
but the officials stressed this was only an estimate , largely based on satellite imagery , saying that it is difficult to come to a firm assessment because the @entity5 are continuing to move units around			2
early last week , @entity15 officials put the number at more than 30,000 , up by 10,000 from what it was a week to 10 days before			1
@entity43 spokeswoman @entity42 said monday that if reports about @entity5 removing some troops from the border were accurate , " it would be a welcome preliminary step			1
" last wednesday , a classified @entity15 intelligence assessment concluded it was more likely than previously thought that @entity5 forces would enter eastern @entity1 , @entity2 learned			1
the buildup was seen to be reminiscent of @entity53 's military moves before it went into @entity55 and @entity56 in both numbers of units and their capabilities , @entity15 officials said			1
the assessment 's points included : the 30,000 - plus troops on the border are " significantly more " than what is needed for the " exercises " @entity5 says it has been conducting , and there is no sign they are making any move to return to their home bases			1
the troops on the border with @entity1 include large numbers of " motorized " units that can quickly move , as well as air defense artillery			2
additional special forces , airborne troops , air transport and other units that would be needed appear to be at a higher state of mobilization in other locations in @entity5			2
additional intelligence indicates that even more @entity5 forces are " reinforcing " the border region , according to @entity15 administration officials , and all of the troops are positioned for potential military action			1
the @entity15 believes @entity5 may move toward three eastern @entity1 cities -- @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 -- to establish a land bridge into @entity94			1
@entity5 forces are currently positioned in and around @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , according to @entity15 intelligence information			2
in a @entity102 briefing thursday , rear adm. @entity100 said the @entity15 has seen " no specific indications " that @entity5 troops are in fact conducting military exercises along the border with @entity1 and that , whether they do or not , their presence does nothing to de-escalate the situation			1
defense secretary @entity111 was told by his @entity5 counterpart , @entity112 , that the troops did not intend to cross the border but were there only to conduct military exercises			2
president @entity116 on friday urged @entity5 to pull back its troops			2
" you 've seen a range of troops massing along that border under the guise of military exercises , but these are not what @entity5 would normally be doing , " he said in an interview aired by @entity119			2
" it may simply be an effort to intimidate @entity1 , or it may be that they 've got additional plans			0
" and , in either case , what we need right now to resolve and de-escalate the situation would be for @entity5 to move back those troops and to begin negotiations directly with the @entity1 government as well as the international community			1
" @entity1 crisis : @entity24 chief says no @entity5 troop withdrawal seen @entity1 : @entity1 's estimate of the number of @entity5 troops at the border is 88,000 , a spokesman for the @entity143 and @entity144 , @entity145 , told @entity2 on thursday			1
earlier in the week , @entity151 sources put the number at up to 100,000 , including units not immediately on the border that could be rapidly deployed from other nearby areas in the event of a @entity5 incursion into @entity1			1
also , according to @entity1 's @entity158 : there 's " a concentration of military equipment " in @entity5 's @entity162 -- which borders northeastern @entity1 and @entity163 -- near the town of @entity166 and @entity167 district , about 18 kilometers ( 11 miles ) from the border			1
on march 25 , two trains up to 60 cars long arrived at @entity172 train station , about 16 miles northeast of @entity166 , carrying troops and equipment			0
according to intelligence reports , camps , communication systems , medical facilities and military field facilities have been set up in the area			0
@entity5 is using intelligence activities from the air in border areas ; 40 drone flights were reported in two days this week in @entity1 's eastern border control area			1
@entity5 : @entity5 's @entity186 says it is carrying out snap military exercises in its southern and western districts			0
the numbers it says are involved in the drills -- due to run until the end of march -- are much smaller than those cited by @entity3 or @entity0			0
one @entity5 infantry battalion is being withdrawn from @entity5 's southern @entity194 , having finished military exercises , state news agency @entity196 reported monday			0
it is returning to its base in the @entity199 region , hundreds of miles from the border , the outlet said , citing @entity5 's @entity186			2
it 's not clear how many soldiers are concerned , but a battalion would typically number in the hundreds			0
on march 13 , @entity5 said that about 8,500 members of artillery units were training in the southern military district , using weaponry including multiple rocket launchers , howitzers and anti-tank cannons			0
these artillery exercises are taking place in the @entity96 , @entity98 , @entity97 and @entity217 regions , all near the border with @entity1			0
on march 11 , the @entity186 said about 4,000 paratroopers were taking part in airborne exercises in @entity5 's western military district , including the @entity97 region , which borders @entity1			1
@entity5 also had about 22,000 troops in @entity94 as of last week , according to president @entity225			0
up to 25,000 were allowed in @entity94 under the terms of @entity5 's lease of the @entity229 naval base there			0
is @entity94 gone ? @entity24 : secretary general @entity230 said monday that @entity24 " can not confirm that @entity5 is withdrawing its troops " from @entity1 's border			1
" this is not what we 're seeing			0
and this massive military buildup can in no way contribute to a de-escalation of the situation , " he said			0
gen. @entity239 , head of the @entity240 and military chief of @entity24 , previously said the @entity5 force is " very sizable			1
" in remarks on march 23 , he described @entity5 's snap military exercises as " worrisome , " suggesting they had been used as a tool to bring @entity5 forces into a high state of readiness without prompting a @entity24 response			2
" a snap exercise puts an incredible force at a border			0
the force that is at the @entity1 border now to the east is very , very sizable and very , very ready , " he said			1
" you can not defend against that if you are not there to defend against it			0
so i think we need to think about our allies , the positioning of our forces in the alliance and the readiness of those forces in the alliance , such that we can be there to defend against it , if required , especially in the @entity269 and other places			0
" @entity239 also voiced worries that @entity5 troops could roll into @entity1 's southwestern city of @entity274 and @entity276 's separatist region of @entity277 , on the opposite side of @entity1			1
" there is absolutely sufficient force postured on the eastern border of @entity1 to run to @entity277 if the decision was made to do that , " he said			2
analysis from @entity285 , of @entity287 - based defense think tank @entity288 : @entity285 , an expert on @entity5 military matters whose assessment is based on @entity5 , @entity1 and @entity293 sources , rather than @entity294 , puts the number of @entity5 combat troops at 30,000 to 40,000 in total			1
including the support troops also present , for example in transport and communications units , gives a significantly higher number and explains the disparity in estimates given by @entity1 and others , he added			0
there are four groups of these @entity5 forces dispersed along the borders of @entity1 territory , he said			2
one group is in @entity94 , the southeastern peninsula now annexed to @entity5 , while the three other groups are positioned in a kind of triangle oriented toward three eastern @entity1 cites : @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			2
there are also reserve forces deeper in @entity5 territory			0
the forces grouped in southern @entity5 , near the cities of @entity321 and @entity96 on @entity322 , number several thousand , he said			0
@entity285 says he does not believe that forces in @entity5 's western and southern military districts are on the snap exercises claimed by the @entity327			0
one indication is that they are in nontraditional training areas , he said			0
other signs are that the troops are carrying out only low - level activities , that the supposed drills are lasting for longer than usual , and that the forces are dispersed over a wider area than might be expected			0
" if that is the exercise , it 's an exercise to invade @entity1 , " said @entity285			0
this does n't mean @entity5 will invade tomorrow , but it does show clearly what @entity5 's military planners may have in mind if they do go into the eastern region of @entity1 with the intention of severing it from the rest of the country , he said			1
in that scenario , the @entity5 combat troops in @entity94 could act as a powerful second front designed to strike into the rear of @entity1 's forces as they defend an assault from the east			1
