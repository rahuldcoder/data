-- @entity1 talked very fast about the dangers of thyroid gland radiation poisoning as his business line rang incessantly in the background			1
" look , i really have to go , " @entity1 said as he abruptly ended the telephone interview to fill another order			0
@entity1 is president of @entity8 , one of only two @entity12 - approved @entity11 manufacturers of potassium iodide , a medication that can block the thyroid glands of human beings and animals from absorbing excessive amounts of radiation from a nuclear accident			1
experts believe that many of the dangers posed by overexposure to nuclear fallout , including cancer , can be diminished by blocking thyroid absorption of radiation			1
on friday , a massive earthquake and tsunami triggered what is being called @entity32 's worst nuclear emergency since @entity33 since , @entity1 said his @entity35 , @entity36 - based company has received hundreds , if not thousands , of calls from potential buyers in @entity40 as well as repeat @entity11 customers suddenly seeking to replenish their stockpiles of the drug			1
so , too , has @entity44 in @entity45 , which , according to the @entity12 , is the only @entity11 manufacturer of the anti-radiation medication in liquid form			2
@entity48 is the only company in the @entity11 that manufactures the tablet form of potassium iodide , according to the @entity12			1
@entity53 's owner , @entity52 , said her is currently getting inundated by more calls than her 85 employees can handle			2
she and company president @entity56 said they are looking to add temporary employees to help handle the flood of calls			0
they also said they 've added a second shift and are considering staying open around the clock until the current crisis is over			0
officials for both companies said the deluge of requests stemming from @entity32 's nuclear crisis comes as state and local governments , hospitals , schools and other institutions in the @entity11 have expressed renewed interest in replenishing their supplies			1
that 's partly because the threat of nuclear fallout in @entity32 appears to have heightened demand in this country , they said			1
it is also because some of those stockpiled medications are close to expiring			0
that includes the 6 million doses of liquid potassium iodide provided to the @entity11 government in 2006 by @entity44			1
the expiration dates for those medications begin in april , @entity52 said			1
the @entity92 has said that although weather conditions in @entity32 have moved " small releases " of radiation from damaged reactors in the @entity102 out to sea , the @entity11 was " not expected to experience any harmful levels of radioactivity " given the thousands of miles that separate the two countries			1
the federal government , @entity52 said , is n't currently planning to purchase more potassium iodide for national stockpile			2
the @entity107 is a repository of vaccines , antibiotics , antidotes and other drugs and supplies for use in natural disaster , pandemic or bioterrorism attack			0
@entity52 said she began alerting customers that their potassium iodide supplies were starting to expire two weeks ago			1
that prompted an uptick in orders , including one from @entity122 for " hundreds of thousands of bottles , " she said			0
" we do n't have enough to meet the current demand , " she said			0
@entity52 said eyedroppers for the medication are particularly in short supply			0
@entity56 said the @entity11 government should consider tapping into the @entity107 for @entity32 earthquake victims threatened by nuclear fallout from the @entity133 plant			1
" help @entity32 now , " @entity56 said			2
" in the meantime , we would be definitely working towards filling those quantities that are being ordered now			0
" @entity56 said he made that request monday to @entity11 rep. @entity137 , @entity138 , senior member of the @entity139			2
@entity137 has warned that @entity32 's nuclear accident highlights the vulnerabilities of reactors in the @entity11			1
on monday , he called on the @entity144 administration to fully implement a provision in the @entity146 of 2002 to make potassium iodide available for anyone who lives within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant			1
the federal government has never purchased enough to meet that standard			0
there is currently only enough of the medication available for populations living within 10 miles of nuclear reactors in the @entity11 , according to @entity11 officials			2
that 's not nearly enough , @entity1 said			0
he cited the april 1986 incident at the @entity159 in @entity160 , considered the worst nuclear reactor accident ever			0
death tolls resulting from the accident have varied widely according to various studies , with totals ranging from the thousands to more than a million			0
several studies have found that the accident led to a rise in thyroid cancer cases in children as far away as @entity171			0
" even taking the most conservative numbers , it all says there is something wrong with this picture when we know there is n't more potassium iodide out there , " @entity1 said as he talked on his personal telephone line			2
in the background , the other phone was ringing .			0

the @entity32 nuclear crisis prompts calls to @entity11 manufacturers
