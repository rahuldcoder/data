@entity0 -- the unidentified remains of those killed in the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were returned to @entity0 's @entity6 site saturday in a quiet motorcade through the streets of lower @entity9			1
under an overcast sky , the remains moved slowly from the medical examiner 's office several miles away in a solemn procession that included police and fire department vehicles with lights flashing			1
a handful of passers - by paused along the way to take notice			0
there were no dignitaries or speeches as the remains were delivered to their final resting place in an underground repository in the same building as the @entity29			1
" they are finally home , " said @entity30 , whose husband , @entity31 , perished when the towers collapsed			1
" we should be thanking @entity35 they are home in the right place			2
this is where they died			0
this is where they took their last step , their last breath			0
" as she spoke , a group of protesters who favor placing the remains in a monument separate from the museum interrupted @entity30 in a sign of the longstanding dispute over what to do with the unidentified remains of victims of the worst terrorist attack in the nation 's history			1
" how dare you say that the remains ... belong in a museum ? " said one protester			1
shame on you ! " " you 're disrespecting the loved ones , " @entity30 said			2
opponents of the move have said that a museum vulnerable to flooding and which charges $ 24 admission is not an adequate resting place for the victims			0
" the issue here is that the remains we 're talking about -- some 8,500 we believe -- are unidentified , " said @entity73 , an attorney representing those opposed to the move			2
" i hate to be crass			0
but who owns them ? and who has the say in what happens to the unidentified remains ? " in 2011 , 17 families of 9/11 victims petitioned a court to force the museum to consult with the families before deciding what to do with the remains			1
they also asked for a congressional hearing			0
the remains will be stored behind a museum wall inscribed with a quote from the @entity99 poet @entity98 : " no day shall erase you from the memory of time			2
" the medical examiner 's office has custody of 7,930 unidentified remains , which account for 36 % of the 21,906 remains recovered , according to the office 's most recent statistics			1
the medical examiner will continue to work to identify the remains			0
families of the victims will be able to visit the repository 's @entity113 in the days before the museum 's official opening on may 21			2
after that , they can schedule appointments to visit the private room			0
" finally our loved ones are home , " @entity30 said			1
" they are ... in the best place			0
" @entity1 's @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .			0

unidentified remains are moved in solemn procession to september 11 memorial museum
decision to house remains in a repository in the museum remains *controversial*
@entity30 , whose husband , @entity31 , died in the attack , says : " they are finally home "
