-- when @entity2 , his younger brother @entity2 and their friend @entity4 put their 17 - foot boat into the @entity7 last weekend about 20 minutes from where they live in @entity10 , @entity11 , they had no clue that they would soon be caught up in an hours - long battle against a record - setting alligator			1
" we put the boat in at 8 o'clock on saturday night and we got back to the dock with the alligator about 9:30 a.m. sunday , " the 27 - year - old @entity17 driver told @entity0 in a telephone interview			1
it was a long night			0
@entity2 had been one of 920 people picked from 27,000 applicants to participate in the state 's 10 - day alligator season			1
his selection and his $ 100 license gave him the right to catch two alligators -- one of any size , and a medium - size one			1
though they 'd never hunted alligators before , the men were well equipped : a bright light to illuminate their quarry 's eyes , which typically sit just above the surface of the water , a crossbow attached to a 150 - pound fishing line , a deep - sea fishing pole with a snagging hook , a shotgun , @entity47 and root beer			1
during the first few hours , they saw plenty of alligators , but passed them by			1
" i wanted to get an alligator 10 feet or better , " he said			2
@entity55 teen bags state - record - sized alligator about 1 a.m. , they found one that fit the bill			2
" we did n't realize how big it was , we just knew it was big , " he said			1
under the rules of the lottery , hunters are not allowed to shoot alligators in open water , he said			2
" you have to get a line on them			0
" that was n't easy			2
each time they approached the alligator , he submerged , only to pop up a few minutes later dozens of yards away			1
finally , after about two hours , @entity2 -- an experienced hunter -- shot him with the crossbow , striking him in the back			1
the line was attached to a homemade buoy -- made with a 3 - liter water jug containing bells and glow sticks " so when it took off you could hear and see it at nighttime			0
" a few minutes later , they got a second line on the gator with the fishing pole , and the animal took off , sinking to the river bottom and sitting -- for up to 20 minutes at a time -- as the three men tried repeatedly to pull him to the surface			1
" it was like trying to pull up a tree			0
" finally , another two hours later , success : " my buddy grabbed the boat fishing line and pulled him to the top , " @entity2 said			1
but by then , the fishing line had caught around a tree , so they cut it			0
that meant their only connection to the alligator was the buoy line			2
another 90 minutes or so later , they used the buoy line to pull the alligator to the surface and tried to cover his head with a snare			1
" it 's like a noose -- you put it around his neck and , when you pull it up , it tightens up			2
" but the animal 's head was about two feet long and bigger than the snare could accommodate			1
" when we pulled it tight , he went to fighting , then broke the bow fishing line			0
all we had was the snare , " which was not firmly in place			2
at that , @entity2 stuck the barrel of his @entity139 1100 20 - gauge shotgun into the water , aimed it at the soft spot on the back of the animal 's head and pulled the trigger			1
in an instant , the longtime hunter learned a lesson in physics			0
" the gun barrel peeled back like a banana peel , " he said			1
" the gas ca n't escape at the end of the barrel ( under water )			1
i did n't know that before , but now i do			2
i thought they 'd gave me the wrong bullets			0
" it was still useable , however , and two more shots finished the job , which left them with another challenge			0
knee - deep in mud , the three men tried to load their catch into the @entity169 boat , but discovered after much pulling and pushing that they could n't , so they called for reinforcements			2
" we just pulled him over to a sandbar and waited for daylight so we could call some people to help us load him			0
" on sunday morning , two of their friends arrived and helped them pull the alligator into the boat			2
it was only then that they realized they had bagged a big one			0
but they had forgotten to bring a tape measure , so they were reduced to guessing its size			0
" we did n't realize until we took him back to my buddy 's house and took him out of the boat with a tractor and put a tape measure on him that we needed to go get him weighed for a state record , " he said			1
here are the official measurements : 13 feet 4.5 inches long , 727.0 pounds			0
its belly girth measured 67 inches and its tail measured 45.5 inches in girth			0
officials estimated its age at 50 to 60 years			0
their catch beat out the state 's previous record winner in the weight category , which had been set just an hour earlier by a hunting party led by @entity211 of @entity212 , @entity11			0
that gator 's 723.5 pounds and 13 feet , 5.5 inches had broken the previous weight record of 697.5 pounds			0
the current length record is 13 feet 6.5 inches , set by an alligator taken on the @entity217 in 2008			0
@entity2 has stored his prize catch in a deer processor 's walk - in cooler			1
he plans to keep some of the meat , give away most of it to friends , then get the hide tanned , mount the head and the mushroomed gun barrel on a plaque and display it to his friends			1
but he has no illusions that his record will last long			0
" they could break my record tonight , " he said			0
" there 's bigger alligators out there			1
" and he need not worry about the restriction on size			0
@entity2 's brother @entity2 also won the lottery , granting him the right to bag an even bigger animal when they go out again later this week			1
in @entity244 , gator takes bite out of crime -- and man			0

each time they approached , the alligator submerged , @entity2 says
" the gun barrel peeled back like a banana peel "
the snare was n't big enough to cover the animal 's head
" there 's bigger alligators out there , " @entity2 says
