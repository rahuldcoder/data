-- frustrated @entity1 are retaliating for a @entity3 play to weaken their hand in opposing presidential nominations , forcing an all - night session into thursday 's early hours			1
votes on judicial and other appointments took place early thursday morning , part of the fallout after the @entity3 majority enforced a rule change to expedite consideration of appointments , the so - called nuclear option			1
until last month , longstanding @entity18 rules required a supermajority of 60 votes to break a filibuster over a presidential nominee			1
republicans fiercely opposed the change , which now allows the majority @entity25 to break filibusters with 51 votes			1
democrats , who hold a 55 - 45 advantage in the @entity18 , said @entity1 had abused the filibuster privilege around president @entity34 's nominations , and the only way for him to staff his second - term administration promptly and move stalled judicial appointments was to speed things up through a rules change			1
" the @entity34 administration and its allies have done just about everything to get what they want , one way or the other -- even fundamentally altering the contours of our democracy when they could n't get their way playing by the rules , " senate minority leader @entity40 said in floor remarks wednesday			0
" we saw the culmination of that with the majority leader 's power grab in the @entity18 last month			1
" 5 ways life changes in the @entity18 after nuclear option @entity1 are requiring the marathon session if @entity25 want to clear a long list of nominees before leaving for vacation next week			1
@entity1 escalation of the rules fight renewed attention to sharp partisan wrangling one day after lawmakers trumpeted a compromise @entity18 budget proposal brokered across party lines			1
the first vote in the extended session came shortly after 1 a.m. et as the @entity18 approved 51 - 44 @entity75 's nomination on the federal appeals court in @entity77			1
for some , the appointment has been a steppingstone to the @entity80			0
the @entity18 will continue plowing through the backlog of nominees later thursday			2
senators will vote on the confirmation of @entity85 to the @entity86			0
@entity25 began enforcing the " nuclear option " this week , stoking @entity1 ire			2
all - nighters could continue for days			0
@entity3 leaders said they were prepared to stay in session virtually around the clock through saturday night to confirm a list of 10 nominees to a variety of senior posts			0
they range from lesser - known appointments -- such as @entity97 to the @entity98 -- to critical positions -- such as @entity100 to be homeland security secretary			0
there are also several federal district court judge appointments on the list as well as nominees to @entity107 posts and the @entity108			2
customarily , @entity18 leaders work together so the chamber can conduct its business during more regular hours			2
but because of strict parliamentary rules , it 's easy for just one senator to hold things up			0
in this case , the whole @entity1 conference is upset			0
what 's the nuclear option ? so why are they working overnights ? according to @entity18 rules , a certain number of hours of debate can still be demanded by any senator once a filibuster is broken			1
known as " post-cloture debate time " in @entity18 parlance , up to eight hours of debate time is allowed for nine of the 10 nominees on majority leader @entity132 's list			1
for @entity100 , the homeland security nominee , debate can last for 30 hours			0
typically , @entity18 leaders would agree to allow that debate time to run with the @entity18 out of session			2
but @entity1 are angry about the changes to the filibuster rules and are requiring the @entity18 to stay in session			1
@entity132 accused @entity1 of obstructionism			0
" it is hard to imagine a more pointless exercise than spending an entire day waiting for a vote whose outcome we already know , " @entity132 said about the @entity141 nomination			0
" but @entity1 insist on wasting time simply for the sake of wasting time			0
it 's no wonder @entity150 overwhelmingly support the changes @entity25 made to the rules last month in order to make the @entity18 work again			2

new : @entity18 approves @entity75 51 - 44 to serve on federal appeals court in @entity77
@entity1 are angry over rules change that weakens their hand in opposing nominations
the new rules imposed by majority democrats aim to speed up confirmation
overnight session forced by @entity1 is one way to *express* frustration and slow the process
