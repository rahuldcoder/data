the @entity6 - led @entity15 , however , did not immediately specify the service members ' nationalities			0
thursday 's shooting was the third at a base or government building since news emerged that @entity10 troops mistakenly burned qurans and other religious materials early last week -- an incident that has sparked outrage , protests , and violence across @entity8			1
all three shootings were carried out by men in official clothing			0
four @entity10 were killed in the earlier attacks			0
if the troops killed thursday are indeed @entity10 , that would bring the death toll from the three attacks to six			2

rep. @entity42 , who chairs the @entity43 , said 39 of the attacks were by members of the @entity46 and three were by contractors			0
" though less than 1 % of @entity8 forces and security guards have attacked coalition forces , this is 42 attacks too many and the new process must do better , " he said at a congressional hearing			1
most attackers were acting on their own , rather than being puppets of insurgent groups , defense officials testified			0
@entity60 suspended its operations in @entity8 after four @entity60 soldiers were killed by @entity8 counterparts in eastern @entity64 in january			1
that shooting came after another @entity8 soldier killed two @entity60 soldiers in december			1

coalition forces responding to thursday 's incident killed the two gunmen , said capt. @entity75 , an @entity15 spokesman			2
@entity11 said one gunman was an @entity3 soldier and the other , dressed in civilian clothes , was a teacher who formerly ran literacy courses for @entity8 army soldiers			2
@entity8 civilians are sometimes used to teach @entity8 soldiers @entity82 to improve their ability to work alongside @entity15			2
it appeared that the teacher had been planning the attack for at least a year , @entity11 said , because officials found pictures and other documents related to the @entity90 among his possessions			0
@entity10 officials have called the @entity93 burning an error by troops who were inadvertently given the @entity96 and other religious materials to dispose of because they were thought to contain extremist inscriptions			2
@entity10 president @entity99 has apologized for the burning			2
still , gunmen have targeted @entity10 troops in the days following the burning			2
a man wearing an @entity3 uniform killed two @entity10 soldiers at a base in eastern @entity108 early last week			1
over the weekend , two senior @entity10 officers were gunned down inside the heavily secure @entity110 when a junior intelligence officer turned his gun on them			0
the gunman , who had been fired by the ministry but recently rejoined as a driver , is still on the loose			0
the incident prompted the @entity10 to pull military advisers and embedded civilians from @entity8 ministries , and @entity60 announced it was temporarily withdrawing all of its public officials in @entity8 institutions to ensure their safety			1
the unrest following the @entity93 burning has left at least 41 people dead , including the two deaths thursday , and hundreds more wounded			0

in northern @entity140 over the weekend , protesters attacked a police chief 's office and a @entity10 military base , @entity8 and @entity10 authorities said			1
some threw hand grenades at the base , known as @entity147 , and the resulting blasts wounded seven @entity10 personnel believed to be @entity151 members , they said			0
demonstrations outside the @entity154 office in @entity140 on saturday left four civilians dead and prompted the @entity154 mission there to say monday that it is temporarily relocating its international staff			0
@entity10 secretary of state @entity160 said sunday the unrest and targeting of @entity10 has gotten " out of hand " and needs to stop			0
the @entity99 administration feels the @entity8 have not done enough to stem the violence , according to a senior @entity10 official who has access to the latest intelligence and is involved in administration discussions , but declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the situation			1
" we are not going to settle for what has happened to our troops in recent days , " the official said			0
the @entity10 ambassador to @entity8 , @entity176 , maintained sunday that the @entity8 security forces have given their lives to control the demonstrations and protect @entity10 installations			1
