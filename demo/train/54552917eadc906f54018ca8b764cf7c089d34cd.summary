enteroviruses are very common , especially in the fall and winter months			2
the @entity21 estimates 10 to 15 million infections occur in the @entity28 each year			2
but this type of enterovirus -- @entity6 -- appears to be exacerbating breathing problems in children with asthma			1
these viruses usually present like the common cold ; symptoms include sneezing , a runny nose and a cough			0
most people recover without any treatment			0
but if your child appears to be having trouble breathing , take him or her to a doctor right away			1
