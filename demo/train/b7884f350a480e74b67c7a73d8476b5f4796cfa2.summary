@entity0 -- the days of would - be terrorists needing to travel to far - off camps to make contacts and learn how to build bombs is rapidly receding			1
social media forums like @entity7 and @entity8 provide a ready made rolodex of sources -- dig further online , mine those contacts further , gain admission to private chat forums and eventually you will find instructions for bomb making			1
last month @entity18 in the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) launched a @entity7 account that has already gained more than 5,500 followers , and @entity20 's account is following seven people including the @entity26 terrorist group @entity25 's official twitter handle and the @entity28 in @entity29 , which in turn is following another rebel group in @entity32			2
you can see how rapidly the connections start to multiply and how easy it is for a budding terrorist to build up global contacts			2
of course , it is impossible to prove any of these accounts are authentic , but many of their followers think they are , which is worrying in itself			0
the @entity45 security service @entity46 and its sister spy organizations @entity48 and @entity49 all monitor social media , noting who is following whom on sites like @entity7 , and providing vital information about alliances being forged between different groups and individuals			1
but professor @entity58 from @entity59 points out that it 's not without its challenges			0
" this is the big problem because @entity65 , the social media generates so much ' stuff ' and there are so many people involved in chatting with radicals on the internet and to monitor that would require really huge resources and no intelligence service has completely figured out how to separate the ' chatter ' from the ' real , ' significant stuff , " he said			1
" you do n't know , for example , if someone who chats online a lot is very dangerous or whether it 's the opposite -- someone who does n't chat at all and is just listening is actually more dangerous because that person maybe more likely to be operational			0
there 's a lot of the online environment that we do n't know yet			0
" @entity88 from the @entity89 for the @entity90 says social media is vital to modern terrorist organizations			1
" they would not have been able survive , they would not be able to recruit people			0
the human touch always needed , but social media is their shop - window , " he said			1
behind the shop - window of @entity7 and @entity8 accounts are more limited private chat - rooms where terrorist leaders from around the world exchange information and tactics			1
according to @entity88 , one notorious forum was run by @entity108 terrorist suspect @entity107 until it was closed down by the @entity108 , and who was arrested last summer in @entity110			2
@entity88 claims that documents recovered during the killing of @entity113 in @entity114 suggest that @entity113 himself may have posted messages on this forum			0
the dead @entity18 chief was very careful to stay away from electronic devices himself , but it is thought he wrote down messages on pieces of paper which a trusted lieutenant would then type and save on to a usb stick , finally passing this to someone else to post on the forum			0
there is also the case of another militant @entity129 who , @entity88 says , used to log into a chat forum after drone strikes to show his family in @entity133 that he had survived			0
he never posted a message , but his mere presence in the forum left an electronic signature that proved to his wife @entity138 he was still alive			0
read more : who really killed @entity113 ? some experts think there are examples of terrorists who have immersed themselves in this online world of extremism and have " self radicalized " without ever having met another terrorist in real life			1
@entity150 , who allegedly shot dead 13 people and injured 30 others at @entity153 in 2009 , is an example cited by analysts like @entity58 , as a " self - radicalizing " terrorist			2
authorities say he was in email contact with the @entity160 - based preacher @entity159 in the months prior to the shootings , but because of the lack of a wider " plot " or conspirators , the @entity162 has categorized the killings not as terrorism , but as workplace violence			2
read more : dead cleric inspiring new terrorists others though , like @entity88 , say that while online material can put an individual onto the wrong track , ultimately there is almost always a terrorist " mentor " who plays a key role in pushing someone towards violence and that mentoring almost always takes place face - to - face , in somewhere like a mosque , high school or university			1
the big question in light of the @entity187 bombings is whether the @entity189 brothers , suspected of setting the bombs , were also " home - grown " , radicalizing solely online , or whether there was in fact a terrorist " mentor " that capitalized on their discontent and steered them towards violence			1
and crucially , if they are guilty , did they learn their bomb making skills from the @entity199 , rather than in a terrorist classroom in @entity201 ? analysis : the appeal of @entity19 radicalism opinion : should we still fear @entity18			0

social media forums can provide sources for would - be terrorists
@entity45 security services monitor social media sites to track groups and individuals
some experts think terrorists have " self radicalized " through social media
others believe that ultimately there is almost always a terrorist " mentor "
