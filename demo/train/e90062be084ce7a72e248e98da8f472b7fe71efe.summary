-- october 29 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity12 ( @entity13 ) : the city of @entity15 , @entity16			1
@entity17 ( @entity18 ) : @entity19			1
@entity12 ( @entity13 ) : i 'm @entity13 ! @entity17 ( @entity18 ) : i 'm the @entity18 ! @entity21 ( @entity22 ) : i 'm the @entity22 ! @entity23 ( @entity24 ) : and i 'm the @entity24 ! all : and you are about to enter the wonderful world of the wizard @entity27 and @entity0 ! @entity28 , @entity29 : all right , forget fridays			1
that was awesome ! thank you guys so much for submitting that ! we 've got 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines before we hit the yellow brick road , so let 's go ahead and get rolling ! first up : midterm elections @entity39 : four days ! that 's all the time that midterm candidates have left to convince @entity42 to vote for them			1
win or lose in next tuesday 's midterm elections , running for office comes at a price			1
you 've got to produce tv ads , you 've got to make signs , pay a staff			1
all of that adds up			1
@entity51 takes us out on the campaign trail to look at the money trail and see how much is being spent and where it 's all coming from			1
( begin video ) @entity58 , @entity59 : sure , there 's a lot of money flowing in this year 's election			1
but exactly how much being spent is mind blowing : $ 4 billion dollars			1
to put $ 4 billion in context , that 's enough to send about 80,000 students to @entity68 for a year			1
it could buy every person in @entity42 three @entity71 with fries at @entity73			1
four billion is far more than the $ 2.85 billion spent in the last midterm election in 2006 , and dwarfs the $ 1.61 billion spent little more than a decade ago in 1998			1
@entity75 compiled the figures in a new report			1
@entity78 , @entity75 : the stakes are so high this cycle that it 's not surprising that there 's an intensity to this cycle that was perhaps reduced or missing in the last cycles			1
bash : though much of the four billion is spent by candidates themselves , an eyepopping amount is coming from outside candidates ' campaigns ; political parties and independent groups			1
$ 430 million dollars in overall outside spending			1
only $ 31 million was spent in 2002 , less than a decade ago			1
and despite @entity95 ' complaints about being outspent , when it comes to political parties , @entity95 are winning			1
all told , the @entity95 has raised $ 782 million dollars			1
a lot more than the @entity100 , at $ 515 million			2
but @entity100 outside groups , with ads like this , are making up for that gap and then some			2
although @entity95 groups are catching up , they 're being outspent by @entity100 counterparts 2 - 1			2
another fascinating 2010 trend : key industries moving campaign cash from @entity95 to republicans			2
take the health care sector			2
when the president took office , two thirds of its dollars were going to @entity95			1
since health care passed , the industry is giving 60 % to @entity100			2
the same goes for money from @entity119 and the energy sector			2
just last year , both gave mostly to @entity95			2
now , 67 % of @entity119 money goes to @entity100			2
the energy sector : 74 % to @entity100			2
@entity78 : i think they 've got their finger in the air			2
i think they 're looking at the changing poll numbers and seeing that the @entity100 have a clear shot at taking the majority , particularly in the @entity132			2
( @entity133 ) @entity134 @entity39 : following up on some international headlines for you now , beginning in @entity4			2
earlier this week , the nation suffered through an earthquake , a tsunami -- a giant ocean wave caused by the earthquake -- and a volcanic eruption			2
officials are trying to get help to the victims of these natural disasters , but that 's been tough with all the disasters they 've had to deal with			2
plus , @entity4 is made up of thousands of islands , and some of those are hard to reach			2
here , you can see a plane dropping aid in one of the areas that was affected			2
other groups are using boats , but those deliveries can take hours			2
some of the most immediate needs : clean water , food , blankets and medical attention			1
@entity164 @entity39 : in @entity5 , officials are trying to figure out what started an outbreak of cholera			1
they 're testing waste and sewage water for the bacteria that causes the disease			2
the outbreak , meanwhile , is getting worse			2
workers are trying to fight it			2
one of the problems in that fight is that a lot of people in @entity5 are living in tents after january 's earthquake			1
they need medical supplies to survive , but some people ca n't get them			1
dr. @entity185 is in @entity5 trying to find out why			1
( begin video ) @entity185 , @entity187 : how could this have happened ? that 's what @entity190 wants to know			0
@entity192 , medical relief worker : you have someone there , someone here			1
let 's connect the dots			0
@entity199 : she 's talking about trying to contain the outbreak of cholera			0
hundreds have died , thousands still in need of treatment			0
this is where you 're told to come get supplies			1
you arrive here , and if there 's patients waiting , what happens ? @entity215 : well , there are patients waiting			0
@entity199 : there 's patients waiting for these supplies ? @entity215 : yes , when we were sending them out to the hospitals out in @entity223			1
@entity199 : where patients are literally begging for hydration , clean water , the cheapest of supplies			1
and yet medical relief worker @entity190 still waits for hours for her paperwork to be approved before she can get the supplies			1
i wanted to try and understand myself			0
promise warehouse , a @entity234 facility , has the largest stockpile of supplies here in @entity5			1
what people have been waiting for , for hours outside and days in hospitals is this : pallets of @entity243 fluids ; literally , life - saving stuff to treat these patients with cholera , thousands of them			0
but it 's not just that pallet			0
you take a look at this whole warehouse , full , despite what 's happening here in @entity5			1
@entity254 , @entity256 health organization / @entity234 : if we send everything that we have here today , tomorrow we can not answer for 800,000 cases in @entity260			0
@entity199 : @entity261 has the enormous task of helping figure out who gets the supplies and when			1
did it go fast enough ? @entity254 : they , they , i think in every operation like this , you can do things better			0
and there 's a lot of lessons to be taken from this			0
and the country needs to be prepared for what is coming , because the likelihood of spreading of this epidemic is very high			0
@entity199 : that 's something we heard over and over			0
this epidemic is by no means over			0
( @entity133 ) just the facts @entity287 , @entity29 : just the facts ! the @entity289 was the longest and worst economic crisis in @entity42 history			1
it started in 1929 and lasted around a decade			0
during this period , unemployment climbed to more than 25 % , thousands of @entity42 banks failed , and @entity42 industrial production was cut almost in half			1
the depression was felt around the world and led to significant changes in economic theories and policies			0
this day in history @entity39 : a major event that helped plunge the @entity42 into the @entity289 happened on this very day in history : october 29th , 1929			1
or as a lot of people know it , black tuesday			0
@entity119 , the stock market crashed , and hard			0
more than 16 million shares of stock were traded			0
stock tickers , the machines that people used to read stock prices , could n't keep up with all the trading			0
billions of dollars were lost on black tuesday , and thousands of investors were completely wiped out			1
@entity318 @entity319 , @entity29 : today 's @entity318 goes out to mr. @entity321 's @entity42 studies classes at @entity322 in @entity323 , @entity324 ! the word " tuition " can be traced back to what language ? is it : a ) @entity330 , @entity329 or @entity331 ) @entity332 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! tuition , what you pay for instruction , comes from @entity336			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! cost of college @entity39 : the word " increase " comes from latin , too			0
and that is what tuition is doing right now ; it 's going up			0
probably not a big surprise			0
the cost of college has been increasing for years			0
what 's interesting is that tuition at public schools is going up faster than it is at private schools			0
a lot of that has to do with states struggling financially			0
the higher tuition costs help make up for money that schools are n't getting from their states			0
look at the numbers here			0
in - state tuition at a four - year public school is around $ 7,600 per year			0
that 's up nearly 8 percent from last year			0
at a four - year private school , tuition is a little more than $ 27,000 per year			0
that 's up 4.5 percent from last year			0
@entity367 @entity39 : you see this guy ? he could be talking to me on @entity367 ! so can this young lady right here			0
you all can ! on monday , i will be live at @entity373 in the school year 's very first @entity367 conversation we 're having ! you post your questions to our wall , i 'll answer as many as i can as fast as i can ! the date is monday , november 1st , 6:30 p.m. @entity380			0
the address : @entity382 / cnnstudentnews			0
before we go @entity39 : now , before we go today , you always want to try your best in any race			0
but you might want to give it a little something extra in this one			0
you 're gon na need to make sure to stay ahead of the rest of the contestants			0
unless you want to be eaten by zombies ! these guys take that " walking dead " nickname pretty literally			0
more than 200 ghouls gathered for this zombie walk in @entity397 last week			0
goodbye @entity39 : organizing that many zombies in one place takes a lot of brains			0
but no matter witch costume you wear or whether you 're just planning on goblin up candy , it ghost without saying that we wish you happy and safe @entity409			0
i 'm @entity27 , for @entity0 ! ( laughs )			1
