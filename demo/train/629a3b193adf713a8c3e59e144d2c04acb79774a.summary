@entity2 the gunman in the weekend terror attacks in @entity2 grew up amid a violent gang culture that ultimately rejected him for his uncontrollable behavior , before he found a new identity in radicalization			1
so said @entity8 , an author and sociologist who met @entity10 as a troubled teenager in 2011			1
police have still not formally named @entity10 as the suspect in the shootings at a @entity2 cafe and outside a synagogue			1
his identity was confirmed by a senior member of the @entity20 government , however			2
the @entity20 - born 22 - year - old , reportedly of @entity23 origins , was killed in a shootout with police			2
authorities said he was " well - known by the police for several criminal incidents , " including weapons violations and violence , and that he was " known in connection to gangs			0
" but questions remain over who he was , how he became radicalized and whether the threat he posed could have been spotted before the deadly attacks			0
@entity20 : the link between gangs and extremism @entity8 has an unusual insight into the background of a young man he said was living on the fringes of society for years			0
the sociologist met @entity10 and other members of a @entity2 gang called " @entity51 " in 2011 , a time when rivalry between gangs was intense			1
" it was an environment with a lot of gang wars where you could n't move around freely , " @entity8 said			2
" the gang wars in @entity2 started back in 2008 when ( @entity10 ) was 15 years old and that 's the environment he 's been a part of			1
" the gang wars meant that the amount of weapons , the amount of violence exploded , so that the generation that he 's from has become much more hardcore than any other generation we 've seen in @entity20 before him			1
" as a result , @entity8 said , @entity10 -- unlike some other would - be jihadists in @entity73 -- had no need to go to @entity76 or @entity77 to learn how to wield a gun			1
" he got his education in using weapons and dehumanizing other people and ( being ) able to kill them here in @entity20 and in the inner city areas , " @entity8 said			0
in @entity10 's generation , living in his neighborhood , every kid knows someone who 's been killed by other gangs , the author said			1
" that was n't normal in @entity20 10 years ago , " @entity8 said			0
" it 's quite a new phenomenon and people like @entity10 and others from these kinds of gangs , they are more influenced by inner city areas in the @entity98 and the idea of the @entity98 gangs than by the @entity101			1
" but even within that troubled generation , @entity8 said , @entity10 -- athletic and a keen boxer -- pushed the limits			1
when the leaders of his gang and its rivals decided to forge a peace deal , they said they kicked out members whom they could not control , @entity8 said			1
@entity10 was one of them			1
deprived of his gang identity and serving time in prison for a violent offense -- a violent , unprovoked stabbing on a commuter train in 2013 -- he appears to have turned to radical @entity118 instead			1
two weeks after leaving prison , he carried out the shootings at the @entity121 , which was hosting a free - speech forum involving @entity124 cartoonist @entity123 , and the synagogue			0
his former gang has since disowned his actions , saying attacking ordinary civilians is not part of the gang 's culture , according to @entity8			1
officials said he had never been to @entity76 or @entity77			0
and it 's not yet clear exactly how @entity10 became radicalized			1
many members of @entity2 's gangs are from an immigrant background with ties to the @entity101 , said @entity8 , so @entity10 could already have come in contact with radical elements			1
but , he added , " after he went to prison and came out , he did n't have anything to lose			0
i mean , he was a loser man from a ghetto from before he went into prison and when he came out of prison , he was even more isolated			0
and it 's not a secret that a lot of young men become more radicalized while they 're in prison			0
" @entity10 swore fidelity to @entity152 leader @entity151 in a posting made on what was apparently his @entity156 page just before the shooting spree began saturday			1
the post pledges " allegiance to @entity151 in full obedience in the good and bad things			0
and i wo n't dispute with him unless it is an outrageous disbelief			0
" a @entity156 friend of the shooter told @entity3 he believed the page , which has since been deleted , matched the profile of his friend			0
he also said he had trouble relating it " to @entity10 the way i knew him , " saying he had been a good friend who was loyal			2
@entity20 's @entity174 confirmed tuesday that the country 's prison service had sent a report last year warning that @entity10 was at risk from radicalization			2
however , nothing in the report was enough to trigger suspicions that he was planning an attack , @entity180 said			0
@entity10 's path to radicalization -- and what propelled him to act -- will now be under scrutiny			2
authorities are " operating under a theory " that the gunman may have been inspired by the january terror attacks in @entity196 , said @entity191 , the agency 's chief			2
seventeen people died in the @entity199 attacks , which targeted the offices of satirical magazine @entity201 , which had published cartoons of the @entity124 , and a @entity204 supermarket			0
two of the gunmen were linked to @entity209 's @entity208 affiliate , while a third -- supermarket attacker @entity210 -- pledged allegiance to @entity212 in a video he emailed out before the assault			0
the similarities with the @entity2 attack , in which @entity10 also targeted a cartoonist who 'd depicted @entity124 as well targeting members of the @entity204 community , are chilling			2
@entity3 's @entity220 reported from @entity2 and @entity221 wrote from @entity222			0
@entity3 's @entity223 and @entity224 contributed to this report .			0
