-- @entity1 is about to become the most famous @entity3 operative since @entity4			1
except that 's not her real name			2
we 're not allowed to know her real name			2
@entity1 is the name of her character in the film " @entity15 " , which is already generating controversy for its depiction of the hunt for @entity14			1
this has an only - in - @entity17 feel , a collision between our celebrity culture and the need to protect our spies from having their identities exposed			0
so the operative somehow becomes a movie star ( played by @entity25 ) while remaining in the shadows			2
perhaps inevitably , questions are mounting about the @entity3 employee , her personality and her contacts with the filmmakers			1
and she ca n't properly defend herself because she 's not allowed to talk to the press			1
thus it was that the @entity34 ran a highly unusual front - page profile of someone whose name is unknown			2
the woman was passed over for a promotion , the story says , and is an abrasive sort who e-mailed colleagues saying they did n't deserve to share in a prestigious award she received for her role in the mission			1
( by the way , what does it take to get a government promotion if helping eliminate the world 's top terrorist does n't qualify ? ) watch : is @entity15 coverage unfair to female @entity3 operative ? in the movie , @entity1 seems to have a messianic streak , saying after a female colleague was killed during an attack in @entity60 : " i believe i was spared so i could finish the job			1
" did the real - life @entity1 actually say that ? who knows ? @entity65 , the director , says she tried to approach the project as a journalist			1
but even the best docudramas tend to mix reconstructed facts with cinematic liberties			0
' @entity15 's ' screenwriter on interrogation debate @entity15 is generating plenty of controversy , before its opening next week , because it spends roughly half an hour showing an @entity77 detainee being waterboarded , beaten and stripped naked in front of @entity1 in the quest for information on @entity14 's whereabouts			1
@entity0 analyst @entity82 says the film could provide " the misleading picture that coercive interrogation techniques used by the @entity3 on @entity77 detainees -- such as waterboarding , physical abuse and sleep deprivation -- were essential to finding @entity14			1
" it 's hardly surprising that this has become the film 's flash point			0
liberals and conservatives in this country spent much of the @entity97 years arguing over whether waterboarding is torture and whether such coercive techniques , whatever they are called , helped or hurt in the war on terror			0
watch : @entity103 , media critic , takes on @entity104 from a filmmaker 's point of view , torture scenes are obviously more exciting than a @entity3 staffer quietly piecing together clues			2
and the controversy will spur box - office sales			0
but @entity65 and screenwriter @entity112 deny taking a stance about the role of torture in the pursuit of @entity14			2
" this movie has been and will continue to be put in political boxes , " @entity112 told the wrap			0
" before we even wrote it , some people said it was an @entity124 campaign commercial , which was preposterous			0
and now it 's pro-torture , which is preposterous			0
" watch : from @entity127 to @entity128 , the conservative media meltdown but the pro-obama suggestion is , well , less than preposterous			0
@entity65 made this film with the help of officials at the @entity134 , @entity3 and @entity135 who provided her with extraordinary access			1
president @entity124 makes only a brief appearance , but the movie highlights the biggest success of his first term , culminating a manhunt that began after the 9/11 attacks			0
the film can only help burnish his reputation , and the cooperation began soon after one of the most classified missions in @entity151 history			0
when a director gets that kind of official help , it raises troubling questions about the objectivity of those rendering the instant history			2
opinion : did torture really net bin @entity14 ? in an e-mail to the @entity134 last year , @entity3 spokeswoman @entity163 wrote : " i know we do n't ' pick favorites ' but it makes sense to get behind the winning horse			1
... @entity112 and @entity65 's movie is going to be the first and the biggest			0
it 's got the most money behind it , and two @entity176 winners on board			0
it 's just not a close call			0
" watch : the @entity181 tweets -- how @entity182 scours the globe for @entity184 @entity65 has every right to work whatever sources she can , and every administration tries to influence media coverage , but rarely do @entity189 and government work so obviously hand in glove			0
as for @entity1 , we may never learn whether she liked her portrayal in " @entity15			1
" @entity4 was outed against her will ; even if @entity1 's real - life counterpart decides to resign and go public , she would be prohibited by secrecy agreements from discussing her role in the mission			1
the most likely outcome is that the @entity3 operative who helped nab @entity14 will remain an unknown if flawed heroine			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity206 : ' @entity1 ' in new film on finding @entity14 is based on real , but *anonymous* , operative
he says questions are mounting about the @entity3 employee but she ca n't speak to the press
" @entity15 " *producers* had unusual access to real story of @entity14 operation , he says
@entity206 : giving filmmakers such access raises questions about way they portrayed the story
