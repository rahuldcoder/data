-- jockeyed by a man who 'd never ridden it in a race , @entity1 made a late charge saturday to win the 137th edition of the @entity7			1
the colt 's owners tapped @entity10 to ride @entity1 earlier this week , replacing jockey @entity11 after he got hurt while riding another horse			1
@entity10 is a racing veteran , but his best finish in 12 previous @entity7 tries had been second in 2001			2
he had been slated to ride this year 's pre-race favorite , @entity16 , until that horse was forced out after developing a gastrointestinal illness			1

" this is an amazing horse , a very special horse			0
" two horses with much better 9 - 1 odds -- @entity49 and @entity50 -- finished second and third , respectively			1
the latter was trained by @entity52 , who overcame a debilitating heart condition and was trying to become the first woman to train a @entity7 winner			0
