-- the biggest technology story of 2013 is one of the biggest stories of the year , period			1
it has had serious implications in the @entity7 and around the world , and half a year later its true impact is only beginning to be felt			2
in june , the @entity10 first published leaked documents from @entity14 contractor @entity12			1
the classified documents contained information about highly confidential government programs that collect massive amounts of data about @entity7 ' cell phone calls and @entity22 activities the scope of the program has led to lawsuits and protests , a public debate about the right to privacy versus the government 's need to secretly collect information for security			1
another big story this year was cybersecurity , illustrated by a string of attacks by hackers against news organizations , major tech companies and retailers			1
the motivations behind the attacks varied : some , like the recent @entity43 breach , were financially motivated , while others were political statements or acts of espionage			0
they all highlighted the limits of online security and privacy			0
it was a year when established tech companies struggled to reinvent themselves			1
@entity53 continued to push its new @entity55 operating system and @entity55 smartphones , even going as far as to buy the no. 1 maker of @entity59 phones , @entity61 's mobile division			0
in the end , it was n't enough and the company decided on one more big change : a new ceo			0
a bright spot for @entity53 could be its new game console , the @entity69 , which is competing against @entity71 's new @entity70			0
@entity72 did n't have to switch much up to stay popular			0
it announced an expected update to its @entity76 and @entity77 lines with the usual fanfare , slimming down and speeding up the devices , throwing in some flashy features like a fingerprint scanner and new colors to keep the masses interested			0
a more dramatic overhaul was of the @entity86 mobile operating system , which was flattened , simplified and updated			1
@entity88 went public and released a new social micro-video app called @entity90 , @entity87 broke out of the naughty - messaging market and made " ephemeral " communications a hot feature , and virtual currency @entity94 skyrocketed in price while people waited to see if it would drop back down to @entity98			1
some of 2013 's big stories were just previews of what 's to come in 2014			2
wearable technology moved from the hype stage to the prototype stage , but @entity105 and the myriad of not - ready - for - prime - time smartwatches just showed the industry still has a lot more work to do ( on design and social norms ) before these gadgets are hot holiday items			0
tune in next year and see whether face - mounted computers become a socially acceptable accessory , @entity118 printed guns become something to worry about and original content from sites like @entity123 and @entity124 can take on tv .			2
