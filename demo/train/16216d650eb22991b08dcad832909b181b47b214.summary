@entity0 -- after two weeks of climate negotiations in @entity0 , bleary - eyed ministers , negotiators , and advocates are headed back home to the various regions around the world			1
few , if any , are leaving entirely satisfied			2
the pace of progress on climate change is still too slow and the political will for greater ambition remains elusive			1
that said , these talks did achieve the basic goal of extending the @entity17 and moving countries onto a single negotiating track toward a new climate agreement by 2015			1
this leaves the door for more progress ahead			1
this year 's talks took place against the backdrop of two disturbing trends			1
on the one hand , there are multiple signs that climate change is here and its impacts are already being felt around the world			1
on the other hand , the world remains tied to the consumption of fossil fuels that drive more and more greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere			2
with each passing day that we do n't shift directions , we are increasingly locking ourselves into more unstable climate future			1
the real question is : can the international talks have a real impact on climate change ? but before we get to that question , let 's look more closely at the two trends : first , in recent years , we 've seen a surge in climate and extreme weather events , along with analysis and other evidence that the world is on an unsustainable course			1
the most recent and tragic example was @entity58 that swept across the @entity59 this week , killing at least 500 people and leaving tens of thousands displaced			2
typhoons are n't unusual in the @entity59 , but this one is the most southern on record and it arrived particularly late in the year			2
the storm , of course , comes on the heels of @entity68 , which swept through the @entity70 and up the @entity71 of the @entity72 , leaving hundreds dead , and thousands without power or property			2
these are the kind of extreme weather events that are becoming more common in a warming world			2
on top of these examples are a series of powerful new reports that reinforce the dangerous direction the world is headed			2
for instance , the @entity85 just released a report , " @entity88 , " which explores a world with four degrees @entity90 of global temperature growth			2
the picture is not pretty			2
four degrees would bring more intense wildfires , heat waves , and droughts			0
@entity99 life would die off , while pests and disease would increase , the report says			0
already we are seeing that polar ice is melting faster than expected and sea levels are rising beyond many projections			0
for instance , @entity106 just released a study showing that sea levels could rise as much as 6.6 feet by the end of the century			1
furthermore , temperature records continue to fall			0
the @entity72 is on course to have it hottest year on record , as withering drought spreads across two - thirds of the country			0
that brings us to the second major trend , which is the world 's ongoing dependence on fossil fuels			1
@entity123 recently released an analysis showing that there are nearly 1,200 new proposed coal plants worldwide			1
while not all of these will be developed , even a fraction of them would drive up global emissions			0
oil , likewise , remains a dominant fuel source			0
and , despite the enormous profits , the @entity134 has reported that government subsidies for fossil fuels were six times those for renewable energy in 2011			0
this dependence on fossil fuels keeps pushing up the global emissions			0
( 2011 also broke the record for greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere			0
) that 's why what happens in the global climate agreements is so crucial			1
the @entity149 is the only venue that brings all countries together and gives each a chance to have a voice			0
it provides a common arena that enhances transparency and accountability among countries			0
but , the @entity149 is only as effective as the political will of its members			0
right now , when it comes to climate change , we are simply not seeing nearly enough commitment nor ambition from national leaders			1
greater domestic action can instill confidence and help build momentum			0
with more national leadership , the @entity149 can move faster and take a bigger bite out of global emissions			0
of course , the international system can not solve the problem on its own			0
we need business leaders , government officials , and the public to step up as well			0
we need more of their voices in the debate			0
fortunately , public understanding of climate change is on the rise , as is support for action			1
turning again to the @entity0 meeting , it 's certainly clear that the meeting alone wo n't do enough to address this issue			1
but it does put countries on a track and provides them with the opportunity to raise their ambition			0
the time we have to cut emissions to avoid the worst consequences of climate change is running short			1
it 's time for world leaders , negotiators and the public to increase their intensity , to develop more specific strategies , and deliver more emission reductions			2
we need to build on @entity0 and get on a path to a strong , fair and ambitious climate agreement			1
join us on @entity212 / @entity211 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

climate negotiations end in @entity0 , @entity218 without a major agreement
the talks achieved the basic goal of extending the @entity17
@entity123 's @entity215 says progress on climate change is still too slow
@entity215 : @entity227 needs t o ' get on a path to a strong , fair and ambitious climate agreement '
