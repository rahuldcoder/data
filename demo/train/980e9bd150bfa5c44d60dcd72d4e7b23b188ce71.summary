@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 on wednesday revealed what it calls the least expensive computer tablet in the world : a device that costs 2,276 rupees , or less than $ 50			1
to launch the tablet , @entity8 , the minister of human resources and development , communications and information , gave a lofty speech in front of a crowd of students in @entity0			2
" there are some moments in history which will be milestones recognized by future generations			0
this is one such moment			0
" today , we see the beginning of a dream realized ; a dream in which every student in every corner of this country will have access to technology that defines the 21st century			1
" the device is called @entity33 , which means " sky " in @entity34			1
it is the product of a joint venture between one of @entity3 's elite @entity39 -- @entity40 -- and @entity41 , the manufacturer that won the bid			1
" every vision has detractors			0
a lot of things were said about this project ... ( that ) it was simply impossible			0
but it was n't just that others said it ca n't get done by @entity3 or in @entity3			1
the worst was when people said we wish it would n't happen , " said @entity52 , ceo of @entity41			2
but while the device is assembled in @entity3 , it is not completely made there			1
roughly 40 % of the parts come from @entity59 , 25 % from @entity60 , 16 % from the @entity61 and 16 % from @entity3			1
still , one student in the crowd remarked : " you can not even get a touch screen phone at this price			2
people used to say only @entity60 can make such devices			0
we can now say yes , @entity3 is on par. " the idea was dreamed up by the @entity72 through its @entity73 ( @entity75 - @entity74 )			1
on the box , the gadget is not called a computer tablet but a " mobile internet device			1
" it uses @entity82 technology and is light , 7 inches long , and has an hd screen			0
the ministry has put professors ' lectures from @entity40 on the device , which can , of course , also play movies			2
it does have a few drawbacks			0
it has internet access only via @entity94 , and it has only 2 gigabytes of internal memory , but that can be boosted to 32 gigabytes with an sd card			2
the touch screen is not as sensitive as that of an @entity100 , so scrolling with fingers takes some real digging			0
the students quickly figured out that using a pen as a stylus worked better			2
the @entity72 admits the @entity33 is not perfect , but it says it will improve on its product as it gets feedback from students			1
in @entity3 , buying a new blackberry or an @entity110 will set you back from $ 500 to $ 700 , and most people can not afford a price anywhere near that			1
the @entity33 would cater to many more people , but it is not for sale yet			1
at this point , only 100,000 of the devices are in the manufacturing pipeline			0
the @entity72 says it will send those to colleges in @entity3 's 33 states and territories			1
it is meant for the disadvantaged , not those who can buy any new gadget they want			0
" [ it 's ] for the benefit of students who do not have access to libraries			1
" a government official said			2
but at some point -- maybe in november -- the private company that helped complete the project may begin sales , but only in @entity3 for now			2
this is n't the first time the country has surprised the world with an amazingly inexpensive product			0
in 2009 , @entity142 wowed critics with the world 's cheapest car			0
the @entity146 was priced at less than $ 2,500			0
those in @entity3 's @entity72 say they dream of a day when students around the world are able to get their hands on an @entity33 computer , because of its affordability			1
and the ministry and its partners are not done trying to bring down the price			0
the ultimate goal is to make a computer for just $ 10			0
they are on their way .			0
