-- federal prosecutors in @entity2 announced a series of actions friday targeting what they characterized as the " large , for - profit marijuana industry " that has developed since the state legalized medical marijuana for select patients 15 years ago			1
four @entity11 attorneys -- @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 -- detailed in a joint press release and later press conference in @entity18 some steps that have been taken in conjunction with federal law enforcement and local officials in @entity2			1
they include letters of warning to landlords and lien holders of places in which marijuana is being sold illegally , " civil forfeiture lawsuits against properties involved in drug trafficking activity " and numerous criminal cases			1
the latter refers to arrests in recent weeks related to cases filed in federal courts in @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity18 and @entity42 , all part of an effort that @entity45 claimed has resulted in the seizure of hundreds of pounds of marijuana , tens of thousands of plants and hundreds of thousands in cash			1
" the actions taken today in @entity2 ... are consistent with the ( justice ) @entity52 's commitment to enforcing existing federal laws , including the @entity55 , in all states , " @entity11 deputy attorney general @entity48 said in a news release			1
in 1996 , @entity2 voters approved @entity58 215 to exempt doctors and seriously ill patients from marijuana laws and allow them to grow and use it in treatment			2
the bill did n't legalize marijuana for all , but it did lead to the emergence of hundreds of dispensaries where people -- legally only those with medical conditions and a doctor 's authorization -- could get the drug			2
@entity45 , the @entity11 attorney for the @entity74 , told reporters friday that federal authorities " are not focused on backyard grows with small amounts of marijuana by seriously ill people			1
we are targeting commercial operations , which profit from growing and distributing ... and often use the trappings of state law for cover , but in fact are abusing state law			2
" @entity15 , @entity11 attorney for @entity2 's northern district , claimed that " profiteers ... motivated not by compassion , but by money " had " hijacked " the intent of voters to help those suffering from debilitating conditions			1
and @entity13 , from @entity2 's central district , said a chief problem lies in operations that make money not by selling marijuana to the sick , but to relatively healthy people			2
" marijuana sales most often to citizens who have obtained sham doctor 's recommendations solely for the purpose of recreational use are the basis of a massive , massive commercial industry , " @entity13 said			2
but @entity109 , executive director of the advocacy group @entity110 , which opposes marijuana bans and penalties , told @entity0 on friday that targeting those who grow or sell medical marijuana is unsound public policy , especially given what he called widespread public support for the practice			1
" what today 's actions did , if nothing else , is to reinforce the terrific disconnect between the federal government and not only the general population , but the 16 states and the @entity127 that have chosen to get away from the prohibition of medical marijuana , " said @entity119			1
federal prosecutors on friday referred to several " recently unsealed " criminal cases related to their effort			0
one alleged that two people in @entity133 used encrypted phones to coordinate sales of marijuana to locales as far away as @entity138 , netting $ 194,000 each in profits monthly			0
and six defendants out of @entity41 face a 77 - count indictment for allegedly running " a wide - ranging conspiracy that included numerous marijuana sales to underaged persons			0
" @entity45 claimed that people , " often with criminal records , are coming to @entity2 to set up marijuana operations taking advantage of the lax enforcement environment in this state			1
" he also said that investigators " learned that huge amounts of marijuana " are being flown out of @entity2 and sold for " huge amounts of money			0
" authorities said that they also sent out " dozens of letters " in recent days to those who own and hold liens on properties where commercial marijuana is grown and sold			2
in some cases , that has included a threat that the properties could be lost and any funds derived from them -- such as via rent payments -- could be lost			0
@entity45 disputed recent reports claiming that letters went to owners of every property that serves as a marijuana dispensary			2
but he said that all should be " on notice " that their property could be seized under federal law			0
" our objective is not to forfeit the properties , but to stop illegal activity , " said @entity45			0
" but if we have to ... we will			0
" in addition , prosecutors this week filed seven civil forfeiture complaints against landlords they claim knowingly allowed marijuana stores to operate			1
one such complaint , according to the prosecutors ' joint release , alleged that eight of 11 second - floor suites in one @entity189 strip mall were used for such a purpose			0
@entity119 said one open question is whether what 's happened in @entity2 signals that federal authorities will proceed to other states with the intent of cracking down on any who grow or sell medical marijuana			1
he argued that some industry and dispensary model was needed , saying it was n't realistic to force sick people to grow their own marijuana or to limit the places where they can get it			0
" allowing self - preservation is a truly half - baked loaf , in that it does n't acknowledge that truly sick , dying people ( might be led to ) go out and buy illegal marijuana on the street , " he said			0
this would be inferior , he claimed , to " a system that most of us are much more familiar with , where you can go lawfully to a retail outlet and purchase exactly what you can lawfully possess			0
" @entity0 's @entity221 contributed to this report .			0
