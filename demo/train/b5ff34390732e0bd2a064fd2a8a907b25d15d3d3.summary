-- by the time @entity3 won his freedom at age 53 , he had spent 30 years -- most of them on death row -- imprisoned in @entity8 for a crime he says he did not commit			1
law enforcement planted evidence and prosecutors manipulated facts to cast @entity3 as the only suspect in the 1982 murder of 75 - year - old @entity18 , his lawyers claim			1
even with seemingly overwhelming evidence in @entity3 's favor , it took nearly two decades to win his release , in what an appeals court called " one of those exceptional cases of ' extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems			1
' " read the @entity30 opinion on the case ( @entity32 ) his experience raises nearly every issue that shapes @entity37 's capital punishment debate : dna testing , mental retardation , a jailhouse snitch , incompetent defense lawyers , prosecutorial misconduct and " a strong claim of innocence , " said author @entity45 , who wrote about the case in " anatomy of injustice : a @entity48			1
" in other words , a prime example of when " innocence is not enough , " @entity45 said			2
@entity3 would probably still be on death row if not for @entity52 , who began investigating his claims of innocence in 1993			1
when @entity52 met @entity3 , she was surprised that a convicted killer on death row could be " so docile and gentle			1
" two post-conviction review courts rejected @entity3 's claims , though one noted that he " may well not be guilty			1
" but @entity52 never considered giving up			0
" if i throw in the towel , a client dies			0
if i stop working , they stop breathing , " @entity52 said			0
" sometimes , i am the first person who ever stuck by them or treated them with respect			0
" a bloody crime scene @entity3 was arrested in january 1982 for the rape and murder of @entity18 , a wealthy widow in @entity69 , @entity8			1
@entity18 ' longtime neighbor and friend , @entity73 councilman @entity72 , told police he let himself into her house after noticing newspapers piling up in her driveway			0
inside the house , he discovered her bloody corpse in a bedroom closet and alerted police			0
@entity72 also identified @entity3 , who had cleaned @entity18 ' windows and gutters the month before , as a possible suspect			1
within 48 hours , police arrested @entity3 based on a thumbprint found on @entity18 ' back door			1
by april , a @entity89 jury had convicted @entity3 of murder and sentenced him to death			1
it would be the first of three times he would stand trial in the case , followed by years of appeals and post-conviction reviews			2
when @entity52 took on the case , she says , she discovered a disturbing chain of events that led to @entity3 's conviction , starting with law enforcement 's willingness to build a case around @entity72 's timeline			1
from there , @entity3 's lawyers say , prosecutors suppressed blood and fingerprint evidence that could have cast doubt on their case			1
instead , @entity3 's lawyers claim that prosecutors deliberately introduced falsely incriminating statements from a jailhouse informant and hairs from @entity3 that were not found at the crime scene			1
a breakthrough finally came in 2011 , when the 4th @entity122 reversed @entity3 's conviction and ordered a new trial , based partly on findings that @entity3 's trial lawyers blindly accepted the prosecution 's case without bothering to examine the evidence in his first trial and retrial			1
" a healthy skepticism of authority , while generally advisable , is an absolute necessity for a lawyer representing a client charged with capital murder , " a judge wrote in the majority opinion			0
" @entity3 's lawyers disregarded their professional obligation to investigate critical prosecution evidence , thereby engendering ' a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts on to produce just results			1
' " ' could n't believe my eyes ' none of it would have come to light if not for @entity52			0
she was in her mid- 30s when she joined the case the summer before her third year of law school			0
her journey to law school had been hard - fought , with a history of abusive relationships and a stint as a teen serving time in a @entity160 prison for armed robbery			0
at 28 , she began taking community college classes and earned the grades to enter @entity164			0
given her past , @entity52 was pleasantly surprised when the @entity166 accepted her law school application in 1991			0
her professors nudged her in the direction of death penalty litigation when she began to show a knack for the persistent digging the job demands			0
through internships at the @entity174 , @entity52 met lawyer @entity175 , executive director of the @entity8 @entity176			0
during an internship there , @entity175 asked her to help with @entity3 's case by interviewing jurors			2
" i started reading the trial testimony and could n't believe my eyes , " @entity52 said			0
" all the forensic evidence evaporated under the smallest measure of scrutiny			0
" she became immersed in the case , " all @entity3 , all the time , " and " classes became more like an annoying distraction , " she said			2
@entity175 offered her a job as a staff attorney once she graduated , but she could n't wait and moved to @entity8 before the final spring semester , for " @entity3 and @entity175 , " she said , half - joking			1
a few things about the case jumped out at her			0
for one , police said they had seized pubic hairs from @entity18 ' bed and identified them as belonging to @entity3			2
if that was true , @entity52 wondered , where were crime scene photos of those hairs on the bed ? why were n't they packaged like other evidence taken from the scene ? why did n't investigators collect the bedsheets for further analysis ? @entity3 conceded that hairs introduced into trial evidence belonged to him but claimed that police pulled them from his head and groin area after his arrest			1
meanwhile , fibers and hairs collected from @entity18 ' body and marked " @entity218 " on an evidence log were never introduced into evidence			0
for years , the state claimed they were missing , until 1998 , when they were found in the private office of an investigator in the case			0
testing revealed a " caucasian pubic hair inconsistent with mrs. @entity18 " that @entity3 's team claims could have cast doubt on the state 's theory that he was the only possible killer			2
@entity72 's " farcical " trial testimony also led @entity52 to question his portrayal by prosecutors as a shocked neighbor and longtime friend			0
when @entity52 interviewed @entity72 in 1993 , within five minutes , she said , he told her , " i am the only one who could kill her and get away with it , the way she trusted me so			0
" @entity72 died in 1994			0
and yet , when @entity3 walked out of prison in 2012 , he was not fully exonerated			2
@entity3 agreed to a deal with prosecutors that allowed him to maintain his innocence while pleading guilty			1
in exchange for pleading guilty to murder , the state dropped a burglary charge and agreed to a 30 - year sentence with credit for time served			2
in the 2012 hearing , prosecutor @entity255 said that the state still believed it had a strong case against @entity3 but that the victim 's daughter supported the plea as a means of ending the case			2
read more about the plea deal ( @entity32 ) @entity52 , however , told the court that his defense team believed @entity3 is " 100 % innocent " but also sought to end the case			1
he could have gone to trial , but she has seen other clients wait years for a retrial			0
she also would have preferred an all - out acquittal , but " immediate freedom stymied ongoing justice , " she said			2
" that the justice system provided an avenue for an immediate release to freedom for mr. @entity3 that was previously not available to him is more justice than injustice , " she said			1
" justice was better served with his freedom			2
" if you were in @entity3 's shoes , would you plead guilty to a crime you did not commit , in order to get out of prison ? share your thoughts in the comments .			1

@entity3 was sentenced to death for a murder he says he did n't commit
lawyers : law enforcement planted evidence and manipulated facts to convict him
*federal* appeals court blamed " extreme malfunctions " in the justice system
to win his freedom , @entity3 pleaded guilty to murder while maintaining innocence
