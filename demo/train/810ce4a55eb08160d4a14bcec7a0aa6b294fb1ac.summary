-- faced with a growing backlash from entertainers and others responding to a documentary film claiming mistreatment of whales , @entity1 bought full - page ads in newspapers nationwide friday to call the accounts inaccurate and paint its employees as " true animal advocates			1
" " the truth about @entity1 is right here in our parks and people , " the company said in the ad , which appeared in the @entity15 and other papers			1
@entity21 ( @entity21 ) immediately issued a statement challenging the accuracy of the ads and encouraging people , " please do n't fall for it			0
" @entity1 has been battered in recent weeks since the television premiere of the documentary " @entity26 " on @entity0			1
the movie traces a 39 - year history of killer whales in captivity , leading up to the 2010 killing of @entity1 trainer @entity32 by the 12,000 - pound orca @entity34 -- a whale previously associated with the death of two other people			2
filmmaker @entity26 said the documentary team 's research for the film shows the whales suffer from boredom and stress and are unsuitable for life in captivity			1
a number of entertainers , including @entity48 , @entity50 rock band @entity49 and country music singers @entity52 and @entity53 , canceled appearances at @entity1 after the airing			2
a @entity57 , @entity58 , school recently canceled its annual overnight field trip to the park after students spoke out in opposition , and a @entity64 , @entity58 , high school cinema class posted a video to @entity66 with students pledging to spend no more money at @entity1 until the company changes its practices			2
' @entity26 ' prompts school to cancel longstanding @entity1 trip social media sites critical of @entity1 also are filled with comments from people vowing they 'll never go to the parks again after viewing the film			1
@entity1 has consistently rejected the " @entity26 " accusations , including in statements to @entity0 , but the ads published friday are perhaps its most visible effort to defend itself			1
in its ad , also posted to its website , @entity1 : denied accusations that it captures killer whales in the wild , saying it last did so 35 years ago			2
said it does not separate whale calves from their mothers except for " the rare occasion that a mother killer whale can not care for the calf herself			0
" rejected claims that its whales suffer shortened lifespans			0
argued its work with universities , governments and nonprofits has helped advance scientific understanding of killer whales in the wild , and said it has spent $ 70 million in recent years on habitats , which it calls " among the largest in the world today			0
" the statement released by @entity21 challenged @entity1 's claims			1
for instance , the animal rights group said , " although @entity1 is right in stating that five of its whales have life spans similar to those of orcas in the wild , it fails to note that nearly every other orca at @entity1 -- some 35 of them -- has died prematurely from violent accidents , preventable injuries , illnesses caused by stressful living conditions , and more			2
" in its ad , @entity1 says , " our guests may enter our gates having never given much thought to the remarkable animals in our oceans ... when they leave with a greater appreciation for the importance of the sea , educated about the animals that live there and inspired to make a difference , we have done our job			0
" the problem , notes crisis communications expert @entity141 , is that some of those former guests are finding themselves increasingly uncomfortable about their affection for @entity1 , and are willing to share their squeamishness with the world			0
for instance , on @entity66 , students from a @entity149 , @entity64 , high school recount their happy memories at @entity1 before promising to stay away until the park changes its polices			0
in another video , a 5 - year - old boy talks of how the film made him angry about @entity1 's treatment of whales			1
while @entity1 can get along without entertainers , widely watched images of children rejecting field trips to the parks will be more troublesome , @entity141 said			0
" oh , it 's really damaging , " he said			0
evidence of whether that proves to be the case could be revealed in february , when the company should next file quarterly reports with the @entity171 showing its financial performance for the quarter that included the @entity0 airings of " @entity26			1
" the company depends entirely on admissions and concession sales for its revenues , which totaled $ 538.4 million in the three months that ended on september 30			0
' @entity26 ' : a chilling doc on captive killer whales @entity0 's @entity182 contributed to this report .			1
