@entity0 , near the @entity1 -- a young mother with 6 - month - old triplets , a laborer still fearful of reprisals , a preacher whose wife was shot dead at an illegal border crossing , wounded in hospitals , a man living in a converted classroom -- these are among the 5,000 or more @entity1 refugees living in @entity0			1
" for many of them , it 's like , if they get detained , they 're dead , " said @entity14 , deputy director of the @entity15 and @entity17 division of @entity18 , about the plight of @entity20 who are still in their country			1
" and i 've heard from many people who say , ' i 'd rather take my risk , you know , escape , maybe die on the road escaping as opposed to getting detained and being tortured			0
' " pressure mounts for international response most @entity20 who succeed in making their way to @entity0 take up residence with relatives or find modest shelter in the working - class neighborhoods where rents are low			1
@entity38 , a @entity1 refugee , told @entity2 that she knows her husband would join the @entity1 revolution if they were to return , so she plans to remain here			1
counting their triplets , they have six children			0
they 're routinely sick and work is scarce , but somehow , the family has managed to scrape by , she said			0
the hardest part , she said , is being away from the rest of their family in @entity20			2
today , many @entity20 -- the activists , the organizers , those who are being sought by the @entity1 government and those who are wounded -- find their way to @entity0 by fleeing through illegal crossings			1
in some places , only a thin finger of water separates the two countries			0
but that passage can carry risks			0
@entity61 knows them too well			2
the @entity64 preacher , who was once jailed on charges of fomenting unrest in @entity20 , moved to @entity0 a few months ago with @entity67 , his 24 - year - old wife and mother of three			1
but she missed her family and returned to @entity20 to visit			2
when she tried to cross illegally back into @entity0 , a @entity1 security agent -- aware that her husband was being sought by @entity1 authorities -- fatally shot her , according to @entity61			1
some of the wounded in hospitals here say they might risk a return to @entity20 through similar illegal crossings in order to rejoin the revolution			1
regular border points are out of the question for them , they say			0
should the world intervene in @entity20 ? though life in @entity0 is not easy , many @entity20 say they left their country for their children , and that the decision to go was a matter of life or death			1
@entity92 says he took his family out of @entity20 eight months ago , fearing for the safety of his five children			2
fear , he said , is rooted deeply in everyone living under the current regime in @entity98			0
" i fled because the army and thugs entered our village and bullets were pouring like rain , " he old @entity2			0
" it was either stay and die , or leave			0
" he still looks over his shoulder , even in @entity0			2
@entity106 found shelter in a dim , converted classroom in @entity0 a few kilometers from the border			1
he and his seven children survive on handouts , for which he is grateful			0
when those handouts arrive , they bring brief moments of relief for @entity106 and , for his children , even joy -- when toys are involved			0
but the growing tide of @entity1 refugees is not a happy one			1
for many , there is the pain of lost loved ones and the depression of not knowing when , if ever , they will go home .			0

thousands of @entity1 refugees are living across the border in @entity0
@entity61 says his wife , a mother of 3 , was killed at an illegal crossing
for thousands of @entity20 , the decision to flee was a matter of life and death
some of the wounded in hospitals say they might risk a return to rejoin the revolution
