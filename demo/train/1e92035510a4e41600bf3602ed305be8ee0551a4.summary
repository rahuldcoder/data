-- when @entity3 fired off a tweet saturday about some " scumbag celebrities " he did n't mean " any particular people , " the @entity2 boss later tweeted			1
" i never referred to any particular people , just some ' dodgy ' self promoting celebrities , " he said , adding the words : " repeat apology for language			1
" @entity3 found himself in trouble on @entity15 over the weekend for apparently referring to @entity17 singer @entity16 , actor @entity18 and television presenter @entity19 as " scumbags " after they met with @entity23 prime minister @entity22 to discuss the potential reform of @entity23 's media laws			1
it 's not clear whether @entity18 attended the meeting , but on october 9 @entity23 media reported that @entity16 and @entity19 met @entity22 during the @entity30 conference in @entity31 , @entity32			1
the meeting came weeks before the @entity34 is due to report its findings on the culture , practices and ethics of the @entity23 press and its relationship with the public , police and politicians			1
the inquiry heard from @entity3 and former @entity23 prime ministers , @entity46 and @entity47 , along with celebrities , sports stars and even the families of murder victims who claimed that their phones had been hacked by employees of the now defunct , @entity3 - owned newspaper , " @entity54 " ( @entity55 )			1
on saturday , the media baron tweeted : the missive prompted this retort from @entity16 : @entity19 , a former detective - turned tv presenter who fronted the @entity23 crime - fighting program @entity61 , also demanded an apology , after earlier tweeting : " i 've been called worse , but admittedly not by ceo of large multinational corp. " both women , along with actor @entity18 -- who is not on @entity15 -- have been vocal supporters of @entity67 , a pressure group that 's fighting for " a better press that is answerable to the public it is supposed to serve , " according to its website			1
they were among 60 signatories to an open letter on october 6 that called on @entity22 to keep an open mind when considering @entity77 's recommendations on press reforms			2
it followed @entity23 media reports that suggested the @entity23 prime minister might be leaning towards self - regulation			1
actor @entity18 told the @entity88 's " the @entity87 " on october 7 that campaigners had been concerned to hear " weird rumblings " from government ministers			0
" we get these odd articles in @entity91 saying the government ... close sources or reliable sources at no. 10 say the government has already decided not even to listen to @entity77 before it 's published and to go with more , yet more self - regulation of the press , " @entity18 said			2
@entity22 appeared on the same program to say he did n't want to preempt @entity77 's recommendations , but added , " we do n't want heavy - handed state intervention			2
we 've got to have a free press			0
" @entity77 is expected to hand down his findings in early november			0
months of evidence included the high - profile grilling of @entity3 , who told the inquiry he did n't believe in journalists using phone hacking or private detectives , calling it " a lazy way of reporters doing their job			2
" he painted @entity2 , which owns the @entity113 and the @entity91 in @entity114 , as well as @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , as a victim of the cover - up			0
" someone took charge of a cover - up , which we were victim to and i regret , " he said			0
last year , at one of two @entity23 parliamentary inquiries into the hacking scandal , @entity3 said his appearance was " the most humble day of my life			1
" a number of former @entity2 staff have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to intercept communications including former @entity55 editor @entity134 who 's scheduled to face trial next year			0
the phone hacking scandal erupted and drew international condemnation when it was alleged that @entity55 reporters had hacked the mobile phone of @entity140 , a 13 - year - old schoolgirl who was abducted in march 2002 and found dead six months later			0
during her disappearance , @entity55 reporters were said to have illegally accessed the teenager 's voicemail , a move her parents said had given them " false hope " that their daughter was alive			0
however , a police investigation found that " it is not possible to state with any certainty whether @entity154 's voicemails were or were not deleted			0
" despite the lack of conclusive evidence in the @entity159 case , dozens of other high - profile victims alleged that private information that could have only come from their mobile phones had been publicly divulged by the @entity23 press			1
in comments published saturday , @entity18 said the soon - to - be released @entity77 report would be a " defining " moment for the @entity23 public			2
" no - one wants a state - run media , but what we have had for thirty - odd years is a media - run state , " he wrote .			0
