@entity0 -- interrogation tactics such as waterboarding , sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture when there was no intent to cause severe pain , according to a @entity12 - era memo on the tactics released thursday			1
attorney general @entity14 says government workers who followed protocol wo n't be prosecuted			0
" to violate the statute , an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering , " said an august 2002 memo from then - assistant attorney general @entity18 to @entity19 , who was acting general counsel for the @entity21			1
" because specific intent is an element of the offense , the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture			2
... we have further found that if a defendant acts with the good faith belief that his actions will not cause such suffering , he has not acted with specific intent , " @entity18 wrote			1
the @entity40 opinion was sought on 10 interrogation tactics in the case of suspected @entity44 leader @entity43			2
the memo authorized keeping @entity43 in a dark , confined space small enough to restrict the individual 's movement for no more than two hours at a time			2
in addition , putting a harmless insect into the box with @entity43 , who " appears to have a fear of insects , " and telling him it is a stinging insect would be allowed , as long as @entity43 was informed the insect 's sting would not be fatal or cause severe pain			2
" if , however , you were to place the insect in the box without informing him that you are doing so ... you should not affirmatively lead him to believe that any insect is present which has a sting that could produce severe pain or suffering or even cause his death , " the memo said			1
other memos allowed the use of such tactics as keeping a detainee naked and in some cases in a diaper , and putting detainees on a liquid diet			0
on waterboarding , in which a person gets the sensation of drowning , the memo said , " although the waterboard constitutes a threat of imminent death , prolonged mental harm must nonetheless result " to violate the law			1
authorities also were allowed to slap a detainee 's face " to induce shock , surprise or humiliation " and strike his abdomen with the back of the hand in order to disabuse a detainee 's notion that he will not be touched , the memos said			0
@entity18 noted in the memo that the @entity21 agreed all tactics should be used under expert supervision			1
other memos said waterboarding can be used only if the @entity21 has " credible intelligence that a terrorist attack is imminent " and if a detainee is believed to have information that could prevent , disrupt or delay an attack , and other methods fail to elicit the information			1
another memo to @entity19 , from principal deputy assistant attorney general @entity116 on may 10 , 2005 , noted that nudity could be used as an interrogation technique			2
" detainees subject to sleep deprivation who are also subject to nudity as a separate interrogation technique will at times be nude and wearing a diaper , " it said , noting that the diaper is " for sanitary and health purposes of the detainee ; it is not used for the purpose of humiliating the detainee and it is not considered to be an interrogation technique			0
" " the detainee 's skin condition is monitored , and diapers are changed as needed so that the detainee does not remain in a soiled diaper , " the memo said			0
another @entity116 memo laid out techniques and when they should be used in a " prototypical interrogation			2
" " several of the techniques used by the @entity21 may involve a degree of physical pain , as we have previously noted , including facial and abdominal slaps , walling , stress positions and water dousing , " it said			2
" nevertheless , none of these techniques would cause anything approaching severe physical pain			0
" all of the @entity21 techniques were adapted from military " survival evasion resistance escape " training , according to a may 30 , 2005 , memo from @entity116 to @entity19			1
" although there are obvious differences between training exercises and actual interrogations , the fact that the @entity163 uses similar techniques on its own troops for training purposes strongly suggests that these techniques are not categorically beyond the pale , " the memo said			0
the memo said waterboarding and other techniques were used on @entity43 ; @entity171 , believed to be the mastermind behind the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and identified as " @entity171 " in the memo ; and another suspected @entity44 leader , @entity175			0
" the @entity21 believes that it would have been unable to obtain critical information from numerous detainees , including @entity171 and @entity43 , without these enhanced techniques , " the memo said			1
" these legal legal memoranda demonstrate in alarming detail exactly what the @entity12 administration authorized for ' high value detainees ' in @entity163 custody , " said sen. @entity180 , @entity181 , and chairman of the @entity183 , in a statement			0
" the techniques are chilling			0
this was not an ' abstract legal theory , ' as some former @entity12 administration officials have characterized it			0
these were specific techniques authorized to be used on real people			0
" in releasing the memos in response to a public records request from the @entity202 and other groups , the @entity198 administration informed @entity21 officials they will not be prosecuted for past waterboarding and other harsh interrogation tactics			1
attorney general @entity14 promised in a separate statement that officials who used the controversial interrogation tactics were in the clear if their actions were consistent with the legal advice from the @entity213 under which they were operating at the time			1
" my judgment on the content of these memos is a matter of record , " president @entity198 said in a statement released from the @entity216			1
@entity198 prohibited the use of " enhanced interrogation techniques " such as waterboarding shortly after taking office in january			1
such techniques " undermine our moral authority and do not make us safer , " he said thursday			0
the president said that while @entity163 must sometimes " protect information that is classified for purposes of national security , " he decided to release the memos because he believes " strongly in transparency and accountability " and " exceptional circumstances surround these memos and require their release			1
" @entity198 argued that " withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time			1
" " this could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past , and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the @entity163 , " he said			0
he added that the officials involved in the questionable interrogations would not be subject to prosecution because the intelligence community must be provided " with the confidence " it needs to do its job			0
the president pledged to work to ensure the actions described in the memos " never take place again			2
" @entity1 's @entity256 and @entity257 contributed to this report .			0
