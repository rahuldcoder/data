-- in the three years since " twilight " bowed in theaters , we 've learned a few things : @entity9 , while teen girls are a sizable portion of the fan base , they 're not its totality			1
two , the first three films of the franchise have pulled in roughly $ 1.8 billion worldwide in ticket sales ( not adjusted for inflation ) , according to @entity16			2
that 's apparently enough for @entity18 , who stars as @entity19 , to talk of being able to afford to fail , and his co-star @entity20 ( @entity21 ) of donating some of her " funds			1
" three , there must be a just a teeny tiny footnote on each installment 's budget for @entity28 's wardrobe , because rare is the moment when the kid is n't walking around without a shirt			1
but as " @entity32 : breaking @entity33 -- part i " opens in theaters today , we 're recounting 10 other ( tongue firmly in cheek ) lessons we 've culled from the series , themes that have been carried from @entity42 's best - selling novels onto the big screen			1
love at first sight is overrated ; he or she should fall for you at first whiff			0
before @entity19 got to know the human he eventually married , he smelled @entity21 from across the classroom			0
yes , his senses are attuned to the scent of human blood , but you 're missing the point : @entity21 's smelled special , like his " own personal brand of heroin , " as he memorably says in the first film			1
ladies and gents , rethink your relationships if they do n't inspire comparisons to narcotics			0
" @entity65 " had it all wrong -- silence , irritation , storming off and mood swings are actually signs of unexpressed affection			1
@entity19 was n't always the sparkly dreamboat of a blood - drinking gentleman you 'll see in theaters this weekend			1
at first , he was actually pretty rude , prone to angrily walking away from @entity21 , being short with her and repeatedly telling her to stay away from him because he 's dangerous			1
talk about mixed messages ! the next time someone gives you the brush off , do n't think he or she is n't into you			0
perhaps they 're just trying to refrain from going for that vein in your neck			0
which brings us to our next lesson : 3			0
be accepting of your partner 's eccentricities			1
quirks such as eye color fluctuations , superhuman strength , the ability to read minds and family members who try to devour you on your birthday are qualities that make a partner unique			1
do n't let silly things like her predisposition to kill stand in the way -- every relationship has its obstacles ! just be glad she 's not a zombie			1
there 's no such thing as personal space when one 's in love			2
@entity19 and @entity21 are so into each other , the thought of being separated for more than a span of a few days could send one of them into an outburst that rivals a demonic possession out of " @entity125			0
" this was depicted with strong commitment from @entity20 in 2008 's " @entity128 , " as she made @entity21 appear to be on the verge of a stroke when @entity19 suggested they should maybe rethink this whole human / vampire relationship thing			1
really , your partner only needs enough space to go to the bathroom and change clothes , and even then , you should be waiting for them on the other side of the door			2
in the event that you and your partner do breakup , withdrawing from life as you lived it while having hallucinations about your romantic partner are all expected side effects			1
that 's why they call it being lovesick , kids			2
since you ca n't control such emotions , one should be open to falling in love with a human , shapeshifter , immortal or a baby			0
@entity28 's @entity158 and other select members of his tribe have the ability to phase into wolves to protect their land , and they can also " imprint , " essentially falling in love and linking themselves with the one person with whom they 're supposed to be			2
they also ca n't help whom they " imprint " on			0
so if it happens that the woman of your dreams was born just a few days ago to the woman you used to have a crush on , well , you 'll just have to wait			0
if one love interest is the fun one , and the other love interest brings the passion , just hang out with both for as long as possible			0
* committing to one person is a tough choice , especially when you could die just from hanging around said individual , so it 's understandable if your affections get pulled in another direction during a vulnerable moment			2
the best thing to do is to maintain one as the " relationship " and the other as the " friendship " until you ca n't play that game anymore			0
bonus if they 're natural - born enemies			2
* frankly , this lesson makes some sense			0
there 's always going to be a rumble brewing , and one of you is always going to have to be saved			2
@entity19 and @entity21 are always fighting off this enemy or that , right up until the very end			0
believe it or not , this kind of stress somehow benefits the relationship -- just think of all that drama as the " spark " that ignites the fire of romantic moments			1
you know , " it 's us against the world / @entity214 , " etc. 9			2
when given the option , go ahead and stay human for the honeymoon			0
and if you 're not breaking the bed while vacationing on your new spouse 's private island , you 're doing it wrong			1
thankfully , there 's hired help ready to clean it all up for you -- that 's what happens when you wed an unbelievably wealthy immortal			1
but if you get pregnant , get ready for one hellish gestation period			0
one can both acknowledge the ridiculousness of lessons one through nine and still be in line for a midnight showing after reading the series ( again )			1
perhaps the biggest lesson of all ? do n't look for nuggets of enlightenment in " twilight			0
" as fans of the series could tell you , the biggest draw is n't the outlandish plot points or the unrealistic romantic ideals , but the classic fantasy of love somehow conquering all			1
have we missed a lesson you 've learned ? we want to hear it in the comments .			0
