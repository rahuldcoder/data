@entity0 -- the @entity7 administration 's vision for the future of manned space flight will bump the @entity4 to " second or even third - rate " status as a space - faring nation , the commanders of three @entity4 moon missions warned wednesday			1
the letter was signed by the first and last men to walk on the moon -- @entity15 from @entity16 and @entity17 from @entity18 -- and @entity19 , who commanded the heroic apollo 13 flight			1
" without the skill and experience that actual spacecraft operation provides , the @entity4 is far too likely to be on a long downhill slide to mediocrity , " the letter said			0
" @entity4 must decide if it wishes to remain a leader in space			0
if it does , we should institute a program which will give us the very best chance of achieving that goal			0
" president @entity7 is scheduled to announce his space plans thursday during a visit to the @entity38 in @entity39 , the @entity35 announced			1
the @entity35 said the five - year strategy involves a $ 6 billion increase in @entity43 's budget and additional support for new space technologies			2
what do you think of the proposed space plan ? @entity15 , @entity19 and @entity17 praised @entity7 's increase in total funding for space exploration , which includes money for research , the international space station and a heavy - lift rocket			1
but the astronauts said the decision to cancel the @entity58 for manned space flight " is devastating			1
" " @entity4 's only path to low @entity62 orbit and the international space station will now be subject to an agreement with @entity64 to purchase space on their @entity66 ( at a price of over 50 million dollars per seat with significant increases expected in the near future ) until we have the capacity to provide transportation for ourselves , " they wrote			0
@entity43 's space shuttle fleet will be retired at the end of this year , leaving the @entity64 @entity66 capsules as the only avenue into space until commercial ventures are ready to do the job , expected to be years away			2
@entity7 's proposal to use commercial transport to reach orbit " can not be predicted with any certainty , but is likely to take substantially longer and be more expensive than we would hope , " the astronauts said			1
@entity17 , @entity19 and @entity15 said the more than $ 10 billion spent so far on @entity58 -- including the @entity89 space capsule and the @entity91 rockets to boost it into space will be wasted by the cancellation " and , equally importantly , we will have lost the many years required to recreate the equivalent of what we will have discarded			1
" @entity43 's future , as outlined in the @entity35 documents , would include a multibillion - dollar modernization of @entity38 , expansion of private - sector and commercial space industries , creation of thousands of jobs and eventually human travel to @entity107			2
but @entity108 , news chief at the @entity38 , told @entity1 that layoffs at the center will likely reach the 7,000 range with the end of the shuttle and the cancellation of the @entity58			0
the president 's plans would shift some funding away from @entity43 's costly human space flight program to @entity43 's scientific programs , including robotic missions to other planets			1
during a briefing in early april , @entity43 administrator @entity122 praised the new future being charted for the agency			0
" this budget provides an increase to @entity43 at a time when funding is scarce , " @entity126 said			2
" it will enable us to accomplish inspiring exploration , science and ( research and development ) , the kinds of things the agency has been known for throughout its history			0
" @entity1 's @entity141 and @entity142 and @entity1 's @entity143 contributed to this report .			0
