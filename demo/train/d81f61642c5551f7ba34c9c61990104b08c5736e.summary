@entity0 , @entity1 -- a potent stash of @entity5 - made surface - to - air missiles is missing from a huge @entity0 weapons warehouse amid reports of weapons looting across war - torn @entity1			1
they are @entity11 shoulder - launched missiles , also known as @entity13 missiles , the equivalent of @entity17 - made @entity16 missiles			1
a @entity2 team and @entity19 found dozens of empty crates marked with packing lists and inventory numbers that identified the items as @entity13 surface - to - air missiles			1
the list for one box , for example , written in @entity25 and @entity5 , said it had contained two missiles , with inventory number " @entity34 , " and a power source , inventory number " @entity33			1
" @entity36 sa - 24s are designed to target front - line aircraft , helicopters , cruise missiles and drones			1
they can shoot down a plane flying as high as 11,000 feet and can travel 19,000 feet straight out			0
fighters aligned with the @entity45 and others swiped armaments from the storage facility , witnesses told @entity19			0
the warehouse is located near a base of the @entity51 , a special forces unit in @entity53 's military , in the southeastern part of the capital			1
the warehouse contains mortars and artillery rounds , but there are empty crates for those items as well			1
there are also empty boxes for another surface - to - air missile , the @entity65			2
@entity66 , @entity19 emergencies director , told @entity2 he has seen the same pattern in armories looted elsewhere in @entity1 , noting that " in every city we arrive , the first thing to disappear are the surface - to - air missiles			1
" he said such missiles can fetch many thousands of dollars on the black market			2
" we are talking about some 20,000 surface - to - air missiles in all of @entity1 , and i 've seen cars packed with them			1
" they could turn all of @entity79 into a no - fly zone			2
" there was no immediate comment from @entity45 officials			0
the lack of security at the weapons site raises concerns about stability in @entity1 and whether the new @entity45 leadership is doing enough to stop the weapons from getting into the wrong hands			0
a @entity93 official , who asked to not be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter , said 575 surface - to - air missiles , radar systems and sites or storage facilities were hit by @entity93 airstrikes and either damaged or destroyed between march 31 and saturday			1
he did n't elaborate on the specifics about the targets			0
gen. @entity102 , chief of @entity103 , has said he 's concerned about the proliferation of weapons , most notably the shoulder - fired surface - to - air missiles			1
he said there were about 20,000 in @entity1 when the international operation began earlier this year and many of them have not been accounted for			0
" that 's going to be a concern for some period of time , " he said in april			2
@entity114 , the @entity115 counterterrorism coordinator , raised concerns monday about the possibility that @entity118 , based in @entity79 , could gain access to small arms , machine guns and surface - to - air missiles			1
@entity124 officials worry that weapons from the storage sites will end up in the hands of militants or adversaries like @entity130			0
the governments of neighboring @entity133 and @entity134 have both said that weapons from @entity1 are already being smuggled into their countries , and they are destined for @entity118			0
they include detonators and a plastic explosive called @entity139			0
@entity134 's president said they include @entity65 missiles			2
an ethnic @entity144 leader in the northern @entity133 city of @entity146 also said many weapons have come across the border			0
he said he and other @entity144 leaders are anxious about @entity53 's @entity144 fighters returning home -- with their weapons -- and making common cause with @entity118 cells in the region			0
@entity53 's fighting forces have included mercenaries from other @entity159 nations			0
the missing weapons also conjure fears of what happened in @entity163 , where people grabbed scores of weapons when @entity168 's regime was overthrown			1
@entity66 said one or two of the missing artillery rounds are " enough to make a car bomb			2
" " we should remember what happened in @entity163 , " he said , when the " country was turned upside down " by insurgents using such weaponry			2
there have been similar concerns in @entity179 , where the @entity17 provided thousands of @entity16 missiles to the @entity179 mujahedeen when they were fighting the @entity182 in the 1980s			1
the @entity17 has spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy them back , fearful that they would fall into the hands of terrorists			0
@entity2 's @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 contributed to this report			0
