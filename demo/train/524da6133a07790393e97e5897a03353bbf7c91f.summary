-- @entity1 may be the head that wears the crown , but hot is the head that 's third in line			0
prince @entity6 , 28 , has been named the @entity7 , according to the editors at @entity9 , which named the current top 50 bachelors in the world			1
" prince @entity14 's baby brother flirts and flies @entity16 helicopters with equal aplomb , " the magazine wrote			1
the list is n't very @entity21 specific ( although both @entity19 and @entity20 made the cut )			1
instead , in addition to the prince , people like @entity25 's son , @entity26 , president @entity28 's speechwriter @entity27 , and @entity30 shipping heir @entity24 ( who has dated both @entity31 and @entity32 ) snagged a spot			0
most hilariously , still - just - a - high - schooler @entity36 made the cut			2
the magazine said it best : " a mere child to some , this @entity42 junior and son of @entity44 was a gateway to the compound for @entity49			0
now he 's lyric fodder			0
" insert your own ' never , ever wanting to get back together ' joke here			0
' ncis ' high , ' @entity53 ' low : ratings it 's hard to make an argument against @entity6 's no. 1 ranking ( although seeing all the attention the @entity59 receives on a daily basis could make some women want to run for the hills )			2

" @entity6 might not possess a towering intellect , " the magazine explained			1
" but he is cooler and more appealing than his older brother , sweet as @entity14 undoubtedly is			1
" you guys ! @entity9 just called @entity14 a nerd ! does anyone even remember when @entity14 was considered the dreamboat of the two ? his big bro may be taken , but word of advice to any woman trying to snag the fun - loving , polo - playing prince so that they can go on double dates with @entity83 and @entity59 : you 'll have to contend with all - too - real @entity87 ( not a @entity86 reference ) in your quest for the @entity89 â € ” and those ladies mean business			1
