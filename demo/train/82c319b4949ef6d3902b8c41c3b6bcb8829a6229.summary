just about any woman who watched @entity1 publicly declare her decision to stick with her husband , embattled @entity5 mayoral candidate @entity4 , had to feel sympathy for her			1
how could you not ? no wife , already facing her husband 's sexually explicit digital relationship with another woman ( yet again ! ) , wants to face the prying eyes of the public , too			2
but while women pretty unanimously feel for her , they have dramatically different reactions about whether she 's doing the right thing , judging from the responses of several women i interviewed from across the country wednesday			1
" i think she 's a good wife ... and she 's a loyal wife , " said @entity22 , a married mom with two grown sons in @entity24 , @entity25			2
" i think it 's great that she 's backing him			2
" " these days it has become too easy to just walk away when someone shows their character flaws or does n't live up to their end of the marriage contract , " said @entity30 , a married mom with one son who only wanted to use her first name			0
" i think she 's decided that keeping her family intact and holding up her ( end ) of the marriage is worth the pain she 's facing right now			2
" opinion : the public humiliation of @entity1 on the other side are women who think @entity1 is making a terrible mistake , women like @entity50 , a divorced mother with a teenage son who says she put up with " bad behavior " from her ex-husband for years			1
" standing by your man when he repeatedly humiliates you by getting himself into trouble does n't make you a strong woman , " she said			0
" leaving him and respecting yourself will			0
" @entity59 , a married public relations professional in @entity61 , said while she believes the decision to stay or leave is a personal one that only @entity1 can make , she does n't think the former aide to @entity65 should have backed @entity4 publicly			1
" i 'm not convinced she is projecting the best message by standing behind someone who has n't earned her confidence and loyalty , " @entity59 said			0
in the middle of the " @entity73 doing the right or wrong thing ? " debate are women who say we simply do n't know what is going on in their relationship , so who are we to judge ? " we have no idea what transpired , " said @entity82 , a single woman without children who asked to be identified by her first name			2
" i know @entity1 is a smart woman and has n't made this decision lightly , especially with a child in the mix. " all the criticism , especially from women who argue she is not standing up for herself and not asserting her power , really struck a chord with some women			1
" i 've seen people online call her a chump and call her desperate and ( ask ) what 's her problem , " said @entity96 , a freelance writer in @entity5 and mom of two young children			0
" i do n't see the course that she 's taking as weak and capitulating			0
i see it as taking the harder path that requires even more strength			0
" why we act on stupid impulses " i understand from a political perspective that you should be looking at ( @entity4 's ) qualifications for a job , but i do n't feel that anybody should be judging a woman based on how she handles infidelity in her marriage , " said @entity107 , a married mom with two teenage daughters in @entity109 , @entity110			2
@entity119 , a senior legal analyst with @entity120 , a reproductive and sexual health website , and editor of @entity123 , thinks the focus -- for women -- should not be on @entity1 , but on @entity4			1
" i would like to see feminist women focusing on the fact that his behavior is inappropriate and not on the fact that she 's being strong enough or being feminist enough by deciding to take her marriage vow seriously			1
" as women debated , online and off , about whether @entity1 is making the right move , the conversation moved to " what would you do if you were in her shoes ? " " i always think that if that were me , i could never stand by him , but when it came down to it , who knows ? " said @entity141 , a married digital editor in @entity5			1
women who know what @entity1 is going through said no one can know how they would react			2
a woman who wanted to remain anonymous said she learned her boyfriend was sending naked pictures of himself to random women who were soliciting sex			0
she broke up with him , and after he sought professional therapy , gave him another chance , but ultimately the " trust was gone " and the relationship ended			0
opinion : why does @entity1 put up with @entity4 ? " i will say that people are very quick to judge those women who choose to stay in relationships with men suffering from this disgusting habit , which clearly is the result of a deeper issue , " she said			1
" i hope for @entity1 's sake that @entity4 has stopped his habit , but i do not think he deserves to be mayor			1
" another woman , who also did not want to be identified , told @entity172 her sexting and infidelity nearly broke up her marriage : " i hurt my husband very badly			0
i can never undo it but i can stand by his side now and not screw it up again			0
" @entity1 's background as a top adviser to former secretary of state @entity183 also became a point of discussion among women			1
@entity1 certainly watched @entity183 , her mentor , deal with sexual allegations against her husband , former president clinton			1
" i imagine she certainly has a lot of experience in navigating these sorts of situations regarding infidelity , " said @entity119			0
@entity197 said @entity1 's critics might speculate that she has political motives , but she disagrees			1
" she 's got a family now and her career is on the back burner somewhat , and it 's all about her love and supporting her husband , and building and keeping that family , " she said			0
follow @entity208 on @entity209 and on @entity210 and like @entity211 on @entity212 .			0

women have dramatically different reactions about @entity1 's decision
some think @entity1 is doing the right thing , others think she is making a bad mistake
one feminist argued that women should be focusing on @entity4 , not @entity225
women also debate the impact of @entity1 's background as a top @entity183 adviser
