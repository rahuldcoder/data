-- @entity1 knows you well			1
the streaming and dvd service knows what you 've rented and streamed and how long it took you to watch			2
it knows what genres you like and what performers you prefer			0
who knows ? it may even have an idea whether you prefer your popcorn lightly salted or slathered with butter			0
( do n't want the rest of the world to know ? it 's also testing a privacy mode			2
) it has taken this knowledge and managed to produce a few hits of its own -- not just with audiences , but also within the industry			0
@entity1 is having a moment			1
its series , such as " @entity27 " and " @entity28 , " recently picked up 31 emmy nominations			1
@entity30 approves of the strategy , having bid up @entity1 's share price 10-fold in the last five years			1
emmy nominations 2014 : what we learned and the audience ? @entity1 just announced it has cracked 50 million subscribers , more than double the number it had just four years ago			1
it has taken some old showbiz lessons -- trust the creatives , budget them appropriately -- and added some new twists : binge - watching			2
exploiting the catalog as if there were nowhere else to go			0
( from the comments on this @entity48 piece , you 'd think @entity1 owned the only copy of " @entity50 " and had it transferred to flammable nitrate stock			1
) can it maintain its dominance ? it was n't so long ago that the place was posting losses and alienating customers			0
pop culture does n't sit still , and neither does business			0
@entity1 , which helped drive @entity58 into oblivion , has to watch challenges from distributors such as @entity62 and @entity63 -- not to mention stay friendly with content providers like movie studios			1
in the meantime , however , @entity1 can offer a few lessons on how to scale the media mountain			1
it 's not tv , it 's @entity1			1
in an interview with @entity0 's @entity72 , @entity1 chief content officer @entity70 made it clear @entity1 was n't going to operate by conventional tv rules			1
" every kind of flavor of ( traditional tv ) should go out the window , as we have conditioned the universe to expect instant gratification by the @entity82 , " he said			1
@entity1 's plan is multifaceted			1
it has its original series , which give it cachet			0
but a majority of @entity1 watching is of old tv series , as if the service is an old @entity92 channel offering reruns of classic shows			1
and then there 's the binge - watching , something anyone who 's ever sat down for a " @entity100 " marathon is quite familiar with			1
finally , there 's the library : tens of thousands of titles at your fingertips			2
@entity1 is on target with its focus on " instant gratification , " said @entity109 , a former @entity110 executive who 's now the @entity111 chair in @entity112 and telecommunications at @entity114			1
today 's audiences -- particularly younger viewers -- want what they want , when they want it			2
they have no concept of " sitting down to watch tv , " he said			0
" that 's a concept foreign to them			2
it 's like trying to tell them what a phone booth is			2
" there 's also something else : @entity125			2
@entity126 and most cable networks are dependent on advertiser dollars			0
@entity1 takes cash directly from subscribers			1
comparing @entity1 with traditional tv networks is like comparing " apples and furniture , " @entity109 said			1
it 's worth noting that @entity137 , who co-founded @entity1 with @entity138 in 1997 , is n't from tv or movies			1
he 's a techie , having made his first fortune with a software development company			2
so a number of @entity1 's moves have been more striking in terms of technology than pop culture storytelling			1
@entity1 was built for the @entity82 -- not for brick - and - mortar strip malls , like @entity58 , its early competitor -- and embraced streaming as soon as broadband became widespread			1
moreover , in 2005 it sponsored a $ 1 million " @entity154 " to go to the software designer who could best improve @entity1 's algorithm -- and the improvements were n't even used			1
" @entity27 , " its first major original success , was built as much on data as it was content			2
" because we have a direct relationship with consumers , we know what people like to watch and that helps us understand how big the interest is going to be for a given show , " @entity1 's @entity157 told @entity158			1
for all the tv and movies we consume , it 's surprising sometimes how little attention is paid to our desires			2
shows are canceled or moved , quality is inconsistent and viewers are subjected to minor annoyances			0
take one example : @entity181 's " @entity180			2
" next season , @entity109 observed , @entity181 is going to split its season in two			0
the show will debut in fall , take a break for the holidays and the @entity187 , then return on a new night			0
the strategy runs the risk of alienating the show 's fan base , he said			2
" i do n't know if the @entity193 of the world would do that in terms of pissing off their customers , " @entity109 said			0
and that 's the thing			2
@entity1 treats the customer well , said brand marketing authority @entity200			1
" they have been very insight - oriented -- they 've listened very carefully to the audience , been able to project audience 's behaviors and they 've developed services and a product operating around that , " he said			1
that builds goodwill , he added			0
" audiences are far more willing to forgive brands that behave authentically and whose intentions are good , " said @entity200			0
" ( @entity1 is ) such a human , intimate , audience - centric brand			1
even if they fail , that will be seen as being coherent with its brand image			0
in a speech at last year 's @entity225 , " @entity27 " star and producer @entity222 -- a biased party , to be sure -- said he and the show 's other producers , @entity228 and @entity229 , appreciated the service 's willingness to take chances			1
" @entity1 was the only company that said , ' we believe in you			1
we 've run our data , and it tells us our audience would watch this series , ' " he said			0
@entity239 , the creator of " @entity28 , " agreed			0
her show was turned down by both @entity241 and @entity242 before @entity1 grabbed it			1
the service " pretty much bought it in the room , " @entity239 told @entity158			0
it 's an old lesson , but one that has to be consistently relearned , said @entity247			0
" @entity242 started it in the late ' 90s -- that 's when broadcast network television was looking over its shoulder -- and @entity251 set the bar , and now @entity1 is raising it , " he said			1
the common bond : trusting creative types and letting them do their thing			0
" @entity259 " host and comic author @entity257 summed up a world of admiration about joining @entity1 , where she 's scheduled to host a variety of programs , including a new talk show			1
" i 'm more excited than i 've been in awhile , and the team at @entity1 is the most forward thinking , alert group i 've sat down with in ages , " she said in a statement last month			1
the @entity273 nominations -- which also included nods for @entity276 ' " @entity275 " -- only added to the buzz around the service			1
@entity1 's shows are built around storytelling , and @entity222 -- reiterating a point made by the late director @entity282 -- noted that the movie studios ' blockbuster mentality runs counter to storytelling			1
the movie business needs to be more flexible , said @entity222 , so it can have both			0
could @entity1 have an effect on the movie business ? not right now , said @entity291 film professor @entity290			1
their business is less about storytelling and more about spectacle			0
" the main thing studios have to do is to get people off the couch and into the theaters , and the thing that 's going to do that is a huge blockbuster spectacle which offers @entity305 , @entity306 , blasting sound , " he said			0
still , with this summer 's dismal domestic box office -- based on play - it - safe big - budget tentpoles and sequels filled with computer graphics -- it 's worth watching if change is in the wind			1
if all the praise @entity1 has earned sounds familiar , it 's because we 've seen this show before			1
the golden child is placed on a pedestal by the media and then knocked to the ground , or simply ignored			0
@entity1 has been called the " new @entity242 , " but the old @entity242 was just as golden as @entity1 in the early 2000s , before shows like " @entity325 " came along			1
( it has since recovered much of its luster			0
) @entity251 was magical when " @entity329 " and " @entity330 " were peaking , less so after " @entity327 " and " @entity328			0
" even @entity331 , sainted @entity331 , has dropped a notch or two from the days before it started revving the wanly reviewed " cars			0
" ( in @entity331 's defense , " @entity333 " has been a merchandising bonanza			0
) @entity1 has had its share of missteps			2
there was the @entity340 debacle , in which an attempt at a dvd - only service failed			2
( to its credit , the company quickly apologized			0
) it 's currently attracting negative notice for stopping saturday dvd mailings , because not everyone has signed up for streaming			0
its series " @entity352 " and " @entity353 , " though both renewed , have n't received a great deal of attention			0
another original , " @entity357 , " barely registered at all			0
now other series are in the works , and may be hit or miss. one recent @entity1 announcement said siblings @entity362 and @entity363 , of " @entity365 " fame , are developing a show called " @entity367			2
" given the @entity363 ' recent track record , that show could go either way			0
still , @entity1 appears to have a plan			2
and as the service blazes its trail , it 's certainly worth watching , said @entity109			2
" this is a whole new world , " he said			0
" i would n't even know how to describe what failure is yet			0
i do n't know that anybody does in the world of streaming			0
" @entity242 is a unit of @entity380 , as is @entity0 .			0

@entity1 has plenty of buzz
service picked up 31 emmy nominations
@entity1 caters to instant - gratification consumerism
