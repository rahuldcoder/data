the @entity0 , @entity1 -- seventeen years after the end of the war , @entity3 gives the impression he is still on the battlefield in what was once @entity9 , staring down his enemy , glowering across the courtroom			1
what the former @entity14 military commander hopes to gain and exactly what he is trying to defend are unclear			0
he may be the only one who expects an outcome other than guilty			0
he seems almost eager to fight all comers to the bitter end			1
the women of @entity21 are in the @entity0 too			1
all these years later , they stand before him , with international justice on their side			0
these women -- the widows , mothers , victims of one of the worst atrocities since @entity29 -- occupy the moral high ground			1
they will not be moved			0
@entity3 shows no remorse but they have sunk so low in despair and desolation that even a bone unearthed in a mass grave raises spirits -- maybe something tangible from a loved one , something to cling to , a hint that truth and justice may not escape them			2
almost 1,000 miles away , most of @entity46 goes about its business with little talk of the war ; life goes on			2
if a question is unwittingly asked by an outsider , it is met with grace , but it hangs awkwardly over the conversation , like an unwanted guest at a dinner table everyone would rather not be there			0
so back here , in a courtroom in the @entity1 , it is the women of @entity21 who have the moral weight to slug it out			1
eight thousand murders in @entity21 alone			2
this is what gives their families such power : there are so many of them			0
they 've become a force @entity3 must reckon with , by proxy of course			2
the international community , in the form of the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) , controls this courtroom battlefield			0
they are such a force , in fact , that the whole country must listen , too , awkward or not			0
no amount of reconciliation -- not that there is a lot -- can really happen until the women of @entity21 and their families get the justice they are looking for			1
can their moral high ground be shared with other @entity46 ? can the country untether itself from the weight of this anchor on progress ? if so , then a bigger battle will have been won in the @entity0			1
@entity3 : villain to many , hero to others will a guilty verdict in the battle still playing out in the courtroom here be enough to win -- @entity3 vanquished to jail , banished from the battlefield by a long sentence ? if not , then no prison sentence will bring back the dead , rectify the wrongs , and @entity46 hopeful of a better future will be hostage to their history and to those who more than anyone deserve a better future , the families of @entity21 .			1

@entity3 seems almost eager to fight all comers to the bitter end , says @entity114
@entity114 : the women of @entity21 occupy the moral high ground in this battle
in @entity46 , the war is an awkward topic and a bane to the nation *'s* future , he says
@entity114 : if justice is *n't* *sufficient* , then @entity46 will be hostage to their history
