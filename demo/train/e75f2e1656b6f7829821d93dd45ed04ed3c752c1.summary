editor 's note : this is another in a series of @entity5 commentaries debunking common tech myths			0
( @entity5 ) -- @entity7 and ceo @entity8 have celebrated a string of huge hits over the past several years , including the @entity11 , the @entity12 and the @entity13			1
reviews have been mostly glowing , sales have been strong and investors have cheered , sending the stock up 40 % over the past 12 months			0
@entity7 , which was struggling a decade ago , is now the world 's most admired and highly valued tech company			1
but @entity7 is not perfect			2
in fact , the company has several weaknesses to address : 1 ) the cloud			0
@entity7 has been bragging about how the @entity12 is a " post-pc " device , but you still need to plug it into a computer to activate and sync it			1
the easiest way to get photos off your @entity11 is to email them to yourself			0
you still ca n't sync your @entity32 music over @entity33 or @entity34			0
@entity7 needs to think about the cloud the way @entity38 does -- as the future of mobile services			2
you should n't be tied to a usb cord to access files			0
you should n't need a pc to use a " post-pc " @entity12			1
you should n't have to email a map link from your computer to your @entity11			0
perhaps this is part of @entity7 's new version of @entity50 , due sometime this year			1
( see our list of suggestions for @entity50 here			0
) the company has a huge new data center in @entity56 and ca n't be blind to the fact that other companies -- @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity38 , etc. -- are doing very cool things with the cloud			0
but for now , @entity7 is still weak here -- @entity65 and @entity7 's @entity64 push notifications not withstanding			1
@entity7 has tried to do " social " a bit with @entity69 , its social network based around @entity32 music , and @entity72 , its social gaming service			1
they are n't huge hits			0
@entity7 has not been able to go as deep integrating @entity76 or other social networks into its products as some @entity80 devices or @entity82 's @entity81 have			1
some of this could be to reduce @entity7 's dependence on other companies , so the @entity11 is more reliable			1
but it seems that @entity7 and @entity8 do n't really get social , and do n't see its value			2
that could burn them in the long run			0
or perhaps , again , this could be addressed in the next version of @entity50			0
for instance , @entity7 could go a long way by making the @entity11 's built - in @entity95 app more social , like the popular @entity97 app. and @entity7 's marketing boss @entity98 is all over @entity97			1
so it 's not like the company is n't highly aware of what 's out there			0
this is n't to say that @entity7 should replicate @entity76 , or even try to build its own general - purpose social network			2
but integrating your existing online social connections could be useful for many of @entity7 's products , ranging from the @entity11 's address book to the @entity109 to photo sharing			1
so it 's time for @entity7 to do more here			2
the new @entity113 just got a small upgrade , in the form of live video streaming for @entity118 and @entity119 games			2
but it 's still the weakest of @entity7 's products , with a relatively limited selection of video			1
and it 's definitely not something tv companies like @entity125 or @entity126 are worried about			1
@entity7 could improve @entity113 with an app store within the next year or so -- gaming could be big ! -- and more video content sooner			1
but it 's a challenge , because this is a situation where @entity7 has to decide between being a good platform -- and allowing rival companies like @entity134 , @entity135 , or @entity60 to thrive -- and being a dominant content seller by keeping an @entity32 monopoly			1
the good news for @entity7 is that no one else is really putting up a fight here yet			2
@entity142 is n't a big success , while @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 have n't caught on with mainstream consumers			0
so @entity7 can take its time			2
@entity149 , @entity7 may even come out with an actual television someday			2
also , these are all areas where @entity7 is relatively in control of its destiny , and can make improvements			0
there are some other areas where @entity7 is vulnerable , such as the threat posed by @entity38 's @entity80 system , and possible production problems because of the earthquake and tsunami in @entity163			1
but that 's a different list			0

is the @entity12 2 really " post-pc " if you have to plug it into a computer to activate and sync ?
@entity7 's @entity173 " social " products fall flat compared to @entity80
@entity113 is no threat to established tv companies like @entity125 or @entity126
