@entity0 , @entity1 -- for @entity4 , gardening started as a way to bond with her children			1
but when the recession hit , her backyard hobby became a necessity			0
" in 2008 , my husband lost his job just like many other @entity12 , and we were living off of our garden , " she said			1
@entity4 and her family of four ate a variety of homegrown foods -- including broccoli , carrots , okra , squash and tomatoes -- so they could make ends meet			1
she was pleasantly surprised by how simple and healthful they were			0

the @entity37 offers gardening supplies and tips , and its website lists locations throughout the @entity12 where seeds are available for pickup			1
