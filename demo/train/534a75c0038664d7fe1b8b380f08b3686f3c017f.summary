-- when @entity2 and @entity3 decided to start selling their own line of hiking backpacks , @entity1 seemed the obvious choice for hub of operations			1
the @entity1 had an existing cut and sew industry with a history of making bags and outdoor gear			1
plus , @entity16 ' retro - inspired , functional backpacks are inspired by the active lifestyle for which @entity1 and the rest of @entity19 has earned a national reputation			1
" @entity19 -- especially @entity1 -- is a lifestyle choice , a destination for someone who wants to be outdoors and still have the comforts and perks of a city , " said @entity21 , who grew up in @entity22 and now lives in @entity23 , about an hour from @entity16 's @entity1 headquarters			1
since 2008 , @entity16 has grown steadily , thanks to interest from across the @entity33 and foreign markets like @entity35 and @entity36			0
last november , it opened its flagship store in @entity1 in a development made of reclaimed shipping containers			1
@entity16 has also expanded into menswear that bears a similar aesthetic to its bags : simple and functional button - up shirts , jackets and pants that could be worn to work , to dinner or even for a hike in the @entity50			2
while growing profit margins certainly helped them expand operations , @entity21 credits a hospitable small business climate with allowing them to open a store much sooner than planned			1
" @entity1 has gone through some big changes in the past four to five years , " @entity21 said			1
" it 's a good time to be here			2
" @entity1 is n't a menswear capital , but @entity16 and other brands based there are drawing attention from beyond @entity19 for their style and quality			1
in the past five years a handful of makers and entrepreneurs have flocked to this city in the @entity50 of about 600,000 people , lured by the active lifestyle and its " small town in a big city " vibe			1
upon arrival , they say they 've found a thriving " portland-esque " makers scene , and a market for their goods among the city 's growing ranks of young professionals			0
these kinds of businesses found a foothold in @entity88 , @entity89 , even @entity90 years ago , but there 's a certain @entity50 vibe to those in @entity19 , @entity21 said			0
" sure , you can buy backpacks and shirts elsewhere , but ours have a different spin because we 're in @entity1			1
" a place for ' work - life integration ' the global nature of fashion and e-commerce allows startups to work from wherever they want			1
so , why is @entity1 the place where these entrepreneurs want to be ? the active lifestyle was the biggest draw for @entity108 , founder of @entity109 , which makes custom - fitted shirts for men			1
" i do n't like the term ' work - life balance ' because it separates the two too much ; it 's more like work - life integration , " @entity108 said			1
" people here know how to live			0
" @entity108 moved from @entity117 to @entity1 in 2011 , shortly before the public launch of @entity109 , which was borne out of @entity108 's difficulty finding clothes that fit			1
@entity108 started building the business in 2010 , combining his technology background as a software developer and his passion for clothing , while he was working full - time as a consultant			2
when it became clear that his design viewpoint and formula for getting a good fit was finding an audience , he left his job and moved his family to @entity1			2
as a consultant , @entity108 visited a lot of @entity33 cities			0
but " @entity1 was always the city that resonated with us , " the 32 - year - old entrepreneur says			1
it 's big enough so it has a variety of cultural offerings and restaurants , but small enough to get across town without sitting in traffic , @entity108 said			1
and , compared to @entity108 's native cincinnati , it 's a young city full of transplants			0
it 's also affordable compared to other metropolitan areas , which allowed @entity108 to build his start - up from his home			2
his business was gaining traction through the online menswear blog community when a customer from @entity158 in town for business showed up at his home seeking alterations			2
@entity108 , who had just returned from a run , greeted him in his exercise gear			0
" at that point i realized i had to step up my game , " he said			0
he opened his storefront in august 2013 in the @entity169 neighborhood , a retail and restaurant hub near downtown @entity1			2
it helps ratio reach a new audience outside the menswear blogs , he said			0
@entity176 and @entity177 also moved to @entity1 from @entity117 in february 2013			2
the couple had started their business winter session in @entity117 , sewing cotton and canvas bags in their apartment			0
the @entity19 natives always intended to return home , and when their business started to grow they decided it was time			0
after living in big cities for more then a decade -- @entity117 , @entity189 , @entity190 -- the couple wanted to live somewhere they could navigate on a bicycle instead of hopping on the freeway			0
they easily found an affordable workspace east of downtown on a small strip that used be known as the jazz district , which @entity177 likens to @entity117 's @entity200			2
they also found a supportive small business community that collaborates on events and marketing rather than working against each other			1
@entity208 's headquarters ' doubles as a storefront and a workspace where the couple and two full - time employees make all of @entity208 's bags and accessories , along with collaborations with other brands			2
they were even able to convince employee @entity219 to follow them to @entity1			2
@entity219 said she was more than happy to leave behind the rat race			0
she says the laid back maker environment in @entity1 gives small businesses room to grow			1
" it 's a very non-competitive environment , " she said			0
" it 's a young scene here and we 're all working toward the same critical mass , so people are n't as protective of what they 're working on			0
" ' @entity1 fashion has a personality of its own ' many of these new businesses cater to the elusive stylish man who is willing to pay more for quality goods			1
his presence has been noted in the fashion capitals , where custom - shirtmakers and curated menswear shops have existed for years			2
unlike your rich uncle 's menswear store , which might carry bespoke suits from @entity158 or @entity247 , these stores are more likely to stock waxed cotton jackets , chambray button - downs , shawl collar sweaters or jeans made of @entity35 selvedge			2
@entity253 of renewed interest in classic @entity33 workwear brands -- sometimes called the " heritage movement " -- the curated shop is more revival than new phenomenon , said @entity260 , creator of the popular menswear blog , " @entity262			0
" " men now want to know where their clothes come from in a way they did n't before , and they want to know about the quality of their clothes in a way they did n't before , " @entity260 said			0
" that was at the center of the ' heritage movement ' before the marketers got hold of it , and it 's a sea change in the marketplace			0
the effects of that change are going to stick around , even after people stop buying defunct workwear brands and opening boutiques that sell colorfully - painted axes			0
" the rise of casual menswear and national retail contributed to the decline of the men 's store in the mid- 20th century , but they 're becoming hip once again , thanks to increasing interest in @entity33 - made products and quality brands from abroad			1
when 27 - year - old @entity298 opened @entity299 on a credit card in november 2012 , he stocked it exclusively with @entity33 - made brands that he liked : red wing boots , @entity304 shirts , @entity306 coats and @entity308 jeans -- clothes with a workwear feel , but a little more refined			0
in @entity88 and @entity90 , " you ca n't swing a cat without hitting one of these shops , " @entity298 said			0
in @entity1 , his biggest competition was @entity316 , he said			2
after closing out his first year in the black , he attributes his success to " like - minded " millennials flooding the city in recent years , creating a market for these goods			0
other @entity1 - based outlets are tapping into the @entity50 lifestyle for inspiration			1
when their shop @entity330 opens in march , owners @entity326 and @entity328 plan to stock it with brands they learned about through their work in @entity88 fashion industry , like @entity336 , @entity337 and @entity338			0
but @entity330 will also include outdoor gear from brands like @entity341 , @entity342			0
" @entity1 fashion has a personality of its own			1
it 's not the @entity347 and it 's not the @entity348 , " said @entity330			0
the @entity1 man is looking for clothes to suit his lifestyle			1
the childhood friends from @entity353 lived and worked in @entity1 before relocating to @entity88 in 2007 to work in fashion			1
as they watched interest grow in small menswear labels , the more they thought there could be a market for them in @entity1			1
@entity330 hopes to reach fashion - conscious men who want to support the brands they read about on menswear blogs , or young professionals who work in places where suit and tie are n't required			1
" they do n't want to go to mall stores that have a menswear section , " he said			0
" these guys want to go into a menswear shop that feels like a menswear shop and talk to guys about clothing and the history of brands			0

somehow , @entity1 has become a *hotbed* of in - demand men 's fashion
the @entity1 lifestyle is a big draw for entrepreneurs and *consumers*
its " maker " community creates a supportive small business climate , business owner says
