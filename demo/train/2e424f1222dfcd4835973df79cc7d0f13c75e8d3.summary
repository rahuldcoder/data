-- @entity1 love a hero			2
so who could resist the touching story of the @entity7 policeman who , seeing a homeless man sitting barefoot in the cold , walked into a shoe store and bought him a new pair of all - weather boots ? the picture of clean - cut officer @entity14 kneeling before bearded , straggly @entity12 became an internet sensation			1
more than 1.6 million people saw it in the first 24 hours after the @entity18 posted the image , which was snapped by a tourist			1
chapter 1 of this story moved millions to shed a tear , and one hopes it inspired countless acts of kindness			1
now , we have chapter 2			2
and it should move us even more			0
@entity12 , who became much less famous than his benefactor , is barefoot once again			0
and the story , as it turns out , is much more complicated than we ever thought			1
@entity7 officials say @entity12 has had an apartment but , for some reason , returns to the streets			0
despite veterans benefits , federal section 8 assistance and @entity38 , he sits on the cold @entity7 pavement and , barefoot , walks its streets			0
clearly , this is a sad situation that will not be resolved with the purchase of a new pair of shoes			1
indeed , while @entity48 deservedly received accolades and media attention , we heard almost nothing about the homeless man ; there was never any reason to believe his fortunes had improved			1
after providing protection for his blistered feet , society simply moved on , happy to pat itself on the back for a job well done -- and just in time for @entity62			1
photos : haunting portraits of the homeless @entity7 police commissioner @entity66 gave @entity48 a pair of cuff links			1
as for @entity12 , @entity66 flippantly explained , " we 're not looking for him			0
he 's much more difficult to spot			1
" @entity12 , 54 , has told reporters that he hid the shoes because " they are worth a lot of money			1
" the explanation is not important			0
@entity12 's family told a reporter that " @entity12 has his life , and he has chosen that life			1
" but can the country turn its back on one of its own , a homeless military veteran , and say " it 's his choice " ? remember the homeless man with the velvet voice , @entity87 ? he , too , was rescued by a miracle			1
but he needed help , substance abuse treatment , before he could keep a job : before he could keep on his all - weather boots			0
what matters is that @entity12 , like thousands of others , in the street , in a country that , despite all its economic challenges , remains the richest nation the world has seen			0
what matters is that a heartwarming act of kindness -- a man opening his wallet to buy another man shoes -- is not enough to keep him from going barefoot			1
some problems are too big for individuals to tackle alone			0
some problems , such as homelessness , require complex solutions			0
some problems remind society that when it came together and organized , it created government			1
the reminder is particularly timely now as the country 's leaders negotiate over the " fiscal cliff			1
" the talks are a political contest			0
but they are also about the soul of the nation			0
@entity1 's leaders are discussing the country 's guiding philosophy			1
sadly for the @entity129 of @entity1 , the weakest of the weak , @entity1 seems to have decided it has less money to help its neediest			0
other nations are undergoing similar debates about their own identity and values			1
@entity1 is not the only country with a homelessness problem , and charges that the @entity1 is callous and indifferent to the poor , which i have often heard abroad , are simply false			0
the @entity141 - based @entity140 , says @entity1 are the most generous people on earth			2
last year , 65 % gave money , 43 % gave time , 73 % helped a stranger			2
despite the economic slump , three - quarters of the giving , $ 217 billion , came from individuals			0
corporations and foundations gave $ 56 billion			2
photos : down and out in the south still , thousands sleep out in the cold			0
in @entity159 , just down the street from @entity0 's headquarters , drivers can spot homeless camps under highway overpasses			1
one caught fire a few weeks ago			0
homeless life is stressful and dangerous			2
practically every major city in the world is home to people sleeping in the streets			2
an estimate of homelessness in @entity172 about a decade ago put the number there at 12,000			0
up - to - date figures are bitterly disputed			0
the consensus among advocates is that numbers have climbed significantly			0
in the @entity1 , 2010 census figures show some of the highest percentages of " street homeless " in @entity181			2
according to those figures , @entity7 has one homeless person for every 2,506 people , compared with one for every 259 in @entity185			1
@entity7 authorities claim to have reduced the number of " unsheltered " individuals to about 3,000 , 26 % fewer than in 2005			0
the @entity189 says statistics underestimate the problem			0
some studies show much higher , but that is because the term " homeless " includes people living in emergency housing			1
in this case , we are referring to the worst category of chronic homelessness : people who spend most nights in the streets			2
whatever the figure , more can be done			0
in @entity206 , a determined government effort brought the number of people living in the streets to just 280 , with thousands receiving help in alternative housing			1
i once saw a city worker in @entity215 help a homeless man off the pavement and walk with him onto a city bus			1
the government seems to have a handle on the situation of each homeless individual			1
not all places are the same			0
cities such as @entity172 and @entity7 have many more immigrants , more newcomers with fewer connections to the community , with less of a safety net			0
there is also more poverty , inequality , unemployment			0
the @entity234 story of the police officer and the homeless man faded in an internet minute			1
and then we moved onto the next social - media sensation			2
but it continued for the man who should have garnered more attention from the beginning			2
the story is not over			2
not for any of the homeless people in the streets of @entity7 or @entity172 , @entity215 or @entity159 , whom we glimpse briefly as we move on with our lives			1
the shoes help ; the cash helps			2
but the more effective act of generosity , the real miracle , would come if the millions looking at the picture of the generous police officer trying to help a man in need wrote the perfect @entity259 , pushing for better mental health services , more affordable housing , more job training			1
for enough attention from the government to those who need it most			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity269 .			0

@entity271 : people moved by story of police officer who gave shoes to homeless man
she says kind act is great , but *wealthy* nations must take lead to help the homeless
she says in " fiscal cliff " *haggling* politicians must consider government 's role in this issue
@entity289 : some nations , like @entity206 , make *strides* on homeless , but all should
