-- last week , the @entity2 @entity1 agreed to hear arguments in @entity4 v. @entity2 , a case that dates back to 2010 , when 28 - year - old @entity6 was charged with multiple counts of communicating threats after he posted a series of violent messages to @entity11			1
although @entity6 maintained that many of the posts , which included menacing statements directed at his wife and a female @entity18 agent , were merely rap lyrics , the jury was unconvinced			1
he was found guilty on all but one of the counts and was sentenced to 44 months in prison			0
the @entity1 's primary purpose in taking on @entity4 v. @entity2 will be to clarify what actually constitutes a " true threat			1
" today , courts across the country are using dramatically different standards : some argue that subjective intent is important in determining whether something is a threat , while others do not , focusing instead on how a " reasonable " person would interpret a message			2
since the @entity1 has n't addressed this issue directly in over a decade -- a period that has seen the explosion of social media and , with it , a radical shift in the way we communicate -- the time is certainly ripe for a new look			1
but the timing of @entity4 is crucial for another reason			0
over this same decade , we have also witnessed the rapid expansion of prosecutors ' use of rap lyrics as evidence in criminal proceedings			1
in the last two years alone , we have served as expert witnesses or consultants in dozens of such cases , and our research suggests there have been hundreds more across the country			0
rather than acknowledge rap as a fictional form told in rhymed verse , one that privileges figurative , often hyperbolic , speech delivered by an invented character , prosecutors have become skilled at convincing judges and juries that the lyrics are autobiographical confessions of illegal behavior or evidence of a defendant 's motive or intent with respect to an alleged crime			1
in effect , they have used the judiciary to re-define rap music as something other than art. given research demonstrating the prejudicial effect that rap , especially violent " gangsta " rap , can have on potential jurors , it 's no surprise that prosecutors misrepresent the genre in this way			1
nor should it come as a surprise that the overwhelming majority of defendants in these cases are young black and @entity97 men			0
rap has always carried the baggage of @entity2 's enduring fears about young men of color , even as its history is rooted in a broader hip hop culture that was conceived by many artists as an alternative to violence , a tool to educate , and a pathway to a better life			2
without that context , judges and jurors become easy prey for prosecutors who use rap lyrics to secure convictions , often when their cases are weak			1
there are examples of such cases to be found across the country , but one of the most recent and high profile has been @entity125 in @entity126			0
the case involves @entity128 , a drug dealer and aspiring rapper who was charged with attempted murder for his alleged involvement in a 2005 shooting			2
during his 2008 trial , prosecutors introduced as evidence 13 pages of his violent rap lyrics -- even though they were all composed before the shooting ( some of them years before ) and none contained specific details about the victim or the crime			1
despite the paucity of other evidence against @entity128 , the jury found him guilty			0
in 2012 , however , an appellate court overturned the verdict , finding that the rap lyrics should n't have been admitted as evidence			1
the justices wrote : " we have a significant doubt about whether the jurors would have found defendant guilty if they had not been required to listen to the extended reading of these disturbing and highly prejudicial lyrics			2
" the state appealed the ruling to the @entity162 , which heard arguments in the case in april and is expected to rule later this year			2
unlike @entity128 , the @entity6 case is in some ways atypical of others we 've seen : @entity6 himself is white , and unlike many defendants , he shows no sign of aspiring to be a professional rapper			2
( he claimed to be using rap as a " therapeutic " medium through which to vent his frustrations , while his wife said he had not regularly listened to rap music and that she had never seen him write rap lyrics during their seven - year marriage			1
) in one respect , though , his case is frighteningly typical			0
whereas rap is usually used to demonstrate a defendant 's involvement in some underlying offense , there is a rapidly growing strain of cases in which rap itself constitutes the crime			0
as with @entity6 , the lyrics , often posted via social media , are treated as threats and prosecuted as such			0
and jurors who are perfectly " reasonable " will convict , even when the defendant is merely following the conventions of a musical genre that , like horror films or gangster novels , should n't be confused with reality			0
at his trial , @entity6 claimed that his lyrics were heavily influenced by @entity204 , the best selling rapper of all time who rose to fame by pushing the lyrical envelope -- even to the point of fantasizing about killing his wife , not unlike @entity6 did when he posted , " there 's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you			0
i 'm not going to rest until your body is a mess , soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts			0
" @entity6 maintained he never intended to act out his lyrics , again echoing @entity204 , who made the critical distinction between art and reality when he said , " i do say things that i think will shock people			0
but i do n't do things to shock people			0
" when the @entity1 hears @entity6 v. @entity2 this fall , arguments are likely to focus on the legal standards used to determine what does and does not constitute a true threat			1
in a may op - ed , we joined professor @entity231 in urging the @entity1 to take this case to provide clarity to this important area of law			1
at the same time , we think the justices would be wise to use the @entity6 case as an opportunity to address the growing prosecution of rap music specifically			2
no other fictional form is singled out this way , and if the @entity1 remains silent about it , more people can expect to be imprisoned for their art. if that 's not a true threat , then what is ? join us on @entity11 / @entity247 .			1

@entity1 to hear case involving rap lyrics used to prosecute a 28 - year - old man
*authors* say prosecutors *increasingly* use rap lyrics to prejudice juries
the *key* issue is whether the *wording* conveys a " true threat " of violence , they say
