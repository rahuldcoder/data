-- my friend @entity1 and i were both born 40 years ago today			1
our lives overlapped for six years , from those first terrifying weeks of seventh grade through high school graduation			1
then , like many of the friends you meet in those horrible , wonderful years , i never saw or talked to him again			2
we did n't start out as friends ; we started out as nothing			2
he was a guy in my math class who wore nice clothes and hung out with the other cool kids at lunch			2
i ran in different circles and had zero interaction with him up until the day we found out we had the same birthday			1
that day , our math teacher , mr. @entity21 , had us go around the room and say our birthdays out loud to demonstrate a point about probability , that in a classroom of 30 people , there 's a good chance that two of them have the same birthday			1
in our class , it was me and @entity1			1
once we discovered this connection , i turned to look at him , and he gave me a slight head nod as he raised a confident fist in the air and let out one of his characteristic low chuckles			2
after class , we talked briefly about where we were born and at what time of day			2
that day , we became birthday friends			1
over time , we became friends			2
@entity1 was an easy person to like			1
he was a quiet and stoic leader , which on first blush could make him seem aloof or arrogant			2
though he could be stingy with his words and often spoke in a low , monotone voice that adults often interpret as deep apathy , he was articulate and witty and thoughtful about the many things in the world that interested him			2
on top of that , he was really smart			2
one day in ninth - grade @entity58 class , he rebelled against miss @entity61 's selected topic of conversation and instead suggested that we discuss the ongoing battle over @entity65 's nomination to the @entity66			1
i admired how he was passionate about a wide range of things , like politics and philosophy and religion and the environment and the @entity74			2
i admired how he never seemed to have an unsure or awkward moment			0
to this day , when i 'm in an uncomfortable social situation , i 'll wonder , " how would @entity1 handle this ? " i saw this quality in him tested , maybe even stretched to the limit , in our junior year			1
@entity1 and i were still in many of the same classes , but for whatever reason , he seemed less and less engaged in school			1
i imagine that a common refrain in the teachers ' lounge when it came to @entity1 was that he was smart but did n't apply himself			1
he missed a lot of classes ; i do n't know why			0
i just assumed at the time that it was because being popular was a full - time job			0
from what i could piece together from movies and tv , it looked exhausting			0
whatever the reason , the absences and missed assignments were taking a toll , and things came to a head in @entity106 class			0
i overheard the teacher tell him how serious the situation had become , and how critical the upcoming exam on " @entity111 " would be			0
i knew he had n't read the book and had n't been in enough of the class discussions to fake it , so i offered to study with him			0
i had my own problems at the time , but helping him was a welcome distraction , a concrete action i could take when i felt powerless over other parts of my life			1
so we went over every mother - loving detail of that miserable @entity127 tragedy			0
in the movie version , this is where i would say that he aced that exam and got his act together and excelled at everything he did thereafter , and it was all because of a little help from his friend who was born on the same day			0
the reality is that i have no recollection of how he did on that exam or how he did in @entity106 or in any of his other classes that year , or what role i might have played in refocusing him			0
still , inside the pages of my yearbook , he wrote a note thanking me for all the help			0
i do know that he eventually pulled things together and that we both survived high school and moved on with our lives			1
i do n't remember the last time i saw him or the last conversation we had			0
but i knew he had started college and focused on his loves of both philosophy and the environment			0
on the night of october 22 , 1995 , @entity162 was struck and killed by a drunken driver as he and his roommate walked to a convenience store to buy charcoal			1
his friend was also killed			0
by that time , i had graduated from college and was living out - of - state			0
when i did finally hear , after the initial shock , my mind kept drifting to all the birthdays he was n't going to have			0
@entity1 was only 22 when he died			1
this is the 18th birthday he 's missed			1
i 've thought about him at each one			1
i think about whatever is going on in my life at the time , and how trivial it all suddenly seems			1
i think about the man @entity1 would have become			1
by age 40 , @entity1 might have become a university professor or a successful entrepreneur or maybe an author			1
his argumentative streak would have made him a great lawyer			0
he 'd probably be married , and maybe a father of kids who would quickly come to appreciate the @entity74			0
and he would have excelled at all these things			0
when i think about him today , i wish i had gotten to know him better			0
he wrote in my yearbook junior year , " i 'll give you a call over the summer , and maybe we can go play a championship - like tennis match at a court within close proximity			0
have a thoroughly stimulating summer , and i hope to see you over it			0
" we never played tennis , and we never saw each other over that summer			0
life has a way of intervening			1
earlier this month , i visited @entity1 's final resting place for the first time to pay my respects in person			1
it 's a very strange feeling to see your date of birth written on a headstone			2
it gives you a sense of your own mortality			0
it makes you think about the life you have and how you are living it			2
when i think about him today , i wonder who the other brians in my life are right now -- am i squandering any opportunities to play tennis with them or see them over the summer ? and because of @entity1 , i try to make an effort to do something about it , albeit sometimes with more gusto than others			1
all these years since our friendship began in mr. @entity21 's class , i thank him for that lesson .			1

@entity0 's @entity233 *shared* a birthday with his *schoolmate* @entity1
@entity233 thought they had little in common , but a friendship slowly formed
the pair promised to stay in contact after school ended but life got in the way
when @entity1 died at age 22 , @entity233 realized friendship is a treasure to be *preserved*
