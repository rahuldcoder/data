@entity0 -- using some of the most dramatic language yet by a @entity5 official , secretary of state @entity2 on friday called on world leaders to contribute far more to the international @entity8 response			1
@entity2 warned that , absent a concerted effort by the international community , " @entity8 has the potential to become a scourge like @entity13 or polio that we will end up fighting -- all of us -- for decades			1
" the secretary made these remarks to a room of foreign ambassadors at the @entity21 in @entity0			1

@entity31 : @entity8 is " not like @entity32 " " there is no country that is exempt from being able to do something to be able to contribute to this effort and help make a difference , " @entity2 said			1
" and everything we do depends on how we coordinate our efforts as partners in how we contribute together			0
" @entity2 praised a handful of countries for their contributions to the effort , including @entity47 -- a historical foe of the @entity5 , that more often finds itself under criticism by the @entity21			1
" @entity47 , a country of just 11 million people , has sent 165 health professionals , " @entity2 noted in his remarks , " and it plans to send nearly 300 more			2
" the @entity53 has called on the international community to give $ 1 billion to the @entity8 response effort over the next six months			2
so far , @entity2 noted , only about a third of that need has been met			0
" we live in a world of a lot of close calls , tough decisions on a daily basis -- difficult and contentious issues where you can have an honest disagreement about what the best course of action is , or about what the facts are , or the results of your decision may be , " @entity2 conceded , adding , " @entity8 is not one of them			2
" so far , more than 4,000 people have died from the epidemic in @entity79			0
