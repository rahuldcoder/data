-- it is not possible to dial an @entity3 number from an @entity5 telephone			1
it will simply not go through			0
that lack of communication stems from the government level , where there is no dialogue between the two countries aside from public speeches meant to carry weighty threats of war to each camp			0
that is why it was so difficult for @entity19 , an @entity5 graphic designer based in @entity20 , to get his message across to the people of @entity3			1
" my idea was simple , i was trying to reach the other side			0
there are all these talks about war , @entity3 is coming to bomb us and we bomb them back , we are sitting and waiting			2
i wanted to say the simple words that this war is crazy , " said @entity19			2
using his graphic design skills and his wife 's help ( she is also a graphic designer ) , he plastered memes over pictures of himself , his wife , his friends and his neighbors			1
he then posted them on the @entity42 page of @entity43 , his small design school , with a resounding message : iranians we will never bomb your country we * @entity50 * you			1
the response , said @entity19 , was overwhelming			2
" in a few hours , i had hundreds of shares and thousands of likes and it was like something was happening			0
" i think it 's really amazing that someone from @entity3 poked me and said ' hello , i 'm from @entity3 , i saw your " poster " on @entity42 , ' " @entity19 said			1
" i thought it was crazy because i never spoke to an @entity3 in my life			2
i woke up my wife : ' there is someone on @entity42 from @entity3 ! ' " he posted his designs for anyone to take and plaster over their own photos			1
the photos and posts have been flooding the page			0
@entity19 says he started the campaign to get past the harsh words and talk directly to @entity3 to see whether there really was anything to fight about			1
@entity3 's nuclear development program is causing alarm in @entity5 and its @entity79 allies			1
critics in the @entity81 say @entity3 is trying to develop a nuclear weapon while @entity3 officials insist their nuclear program is for peaceful energy generation only			2
experts : @entity5 would face challenge in bombing @entity3 nuclear sites @entity19 has received thousands of messages from people in @entity3 sending a statement to @entity5 , he say			1
he shared one private message from @entity3 , without revealing the identity of the sender : " we love you too			2
your word reaches out there , despite the censorship			0
and @entity3 people , aside from the regime , have no hard feelings or animosity towards anybody , particularly @entity5			1
" one post on the @entity42 page says : " we share a common history , have been sharing both our great and ancient cultures , languages and poetry together			2
... we are so similar , and politicians can not cut a tie that has been tied thousands of years ago			2
i am proud to have you as my friends			0
" not all the responses to the campaign were positive , however			0
one meme says " @entity3 we * @entity50 * you so much we are coming over			0
" the first meme was posted wednesday , and @entity19 says he hopes the dialogue will not end merely with @entity3 and @entity5			1
he noted the tension involves more than these two countries and he would like to include allies and neighboring countries in the conversation			0
" the idea is to put the message out there that we do n't want this war			0
" " at the end of it , i will be the one doing this war			0
@entity135 is not going to take the gun , " he said , referring to @entity5 prime minister @entity134 , " i will have to			0
before i go into another war , maybe i check this one a bit better			0
" when asked whether this style of campaign could work with @entity5 and @entity141 , @entity19 said that it was probably already past that point , but now @entity5 has the chance to capitalize on an opportunity to start fresh with another regional neighbor			1
" we are [ right next to ] @entity141 , so communication was not a problem			0
this situation is different because [ @entity5 is ] now just starting to talk to @entity3 , " he said			1
" and maybe just by talking we can end it			0
" in an @entity5 public opinion survey by @entity154 and the @entity155 conducted february 22 - 26 among a nationally representative sample of 500 @entity5 ( margin of error is + / - 4.3 % ) , only 19 % of @entity5 expressed support for a pre-emptive attack on @entity3 nuclear facilities without @entity162 backing			1
and while 45 % believe an @entity5 strike would weaken the @entity3 government , 44 % believe it would actually strengthen it			1
the @entity162 has pushed for a nonmilitary solution , including tougher sanctions and diplomatic negotiations			0
the growing tensions between the two countries have already impacted other countries as well : @entity5 blamed @entity3 for a @entity174 bombing in @entity175 and for a bombing the next day in @entity177 that targeted @entity5 diplomats			1
@entity177 names @entity3 suspects in @entity5 car bombing			2

@entity5 graphic designer @entity19 wanted to speak directly to @entity3
on @entity42 , he posted messages of peace , hoping @entity3 would see them
@entity19 says he 's gotten thousands of messages from people in @entity3
one message from @entity3 : " we are so similar . ... i am proud to have you as my friends "
