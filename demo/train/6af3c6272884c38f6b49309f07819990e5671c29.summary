-- the threat of increasing loan rates on future college students has become the newest political cudgel			1
lowering interest rates on subsidized student loans does little to address the real problems of higher education : rising tuition costs and diminishing returns			1
first , let 's remember how we got here			0
after taking back control of @entity16 in 2007 , then - speaker @entity14 passed legislation that temporarily lowered the interest rates on the federally subsidized @entity19 from 6.8 % to 3.4 %			1
the extension would last until july 2012 , when the rates double to 6.8 % , partly as a budget trick to offset the original costs			1
the @entity25 's editorial board called the whole ordeal " a campaign gimmick that @entity28 cooked up to help them retake @entity16 in 2006			0
... it 's expensive , it 's poorly targeted and it diverts attention and money from bigger problems facing federal support for higher education			0
" with the rates set to expire in the middle of this election season , @entity28 knew full well they could use the threat of rising interest rates against @entity42			1
they 've done exactly that			0
" today you 've got @entity42 who run @entity16 , and they 're not saying whether or not they 're going to stop your rates from doubling , " president @entity44 said at the @entity45 last week			1
feeling the political heat , @entity49 republicans as well as @entity50 agreed to extend the low interest rates			1
@entity42 need not be on the defensive			0
how does the president plan to pay for the $ 6 billion subsidy ? and how will it help control tuition costs ? so far it has n't			1
in 2011 , costs at the average public university rose more than 5 % for in - state students , or about $ 1,100			2
the average tuition at public universities rose more than 8 %			0
by comparison , the rate of inflation was 3 %			0
furthermore , only about a third of undergraduates have subsidized @entity70 and the interest rates for existing loans wo n't be touched			1
the average student with @entity70 graduates with about $ 13,000 in debt , much lower than the national average of $ 25,000			2
if the current rate doubles , they would pay about $ 2,600 more over 10 years			2
the effect of doubling the rates from 3.4 % to 6.8 % is minute when compared to the lifetime earnings of a person with a bachelor 's degree ( approximately $ 2.27 million ) to a person with just a high school diploma ( $ 1.3 million )			2
perhaps most important , extending the low interest rates will not lower tuition costs for the students who need it most			1
the @entity89 largely fund the tuition of middle - and upper - class students on the backs of taxpayers			0
@entity94 , the federal assistance to the poorest students , should be the real focus of discussion			0
if @entity16 continues to subsidize low interest rates , they are handing the problem , and the mountain of debt , to future generations			1
in fact , they are passing on the debt to the very group of people they are trying to help : college students			2
with the federal government backing low interest rates , colleges have no incentive to lower tuition			1
instead , the rates should be variable and tied to the market , not set by the government			2
the real problem here is the colleges and their unholy alliance with the federal government			0
here 's what the president should be saying : the college system is largely failing students and taxpayers			2
colleges continue to raise their prices despite record increases in federal subsidies			0
between 1982 and 2007 , college tuition and fees rose more than 400 % ( about four times the rate of inflation ) today , the average student loan debt exceeds $ 25,000 and total student loan debt exceeds $ 1 trillion			1
less than 60 % of college students finish college in six years or less			0
one out of every two college graduates today are unemployed or underemployed			0
the system overspends and underperforms			0
it 's unlikely that president @entity44 would ever say this			1
after all , he holds the system in his hands			0
last year , in one of the most underreported political moves of his term , the @entity44 administration took over the student loan industry , cutting out private competition from banks			1
taxpayers are now directly responsible for higher tuition costs and the resulting large amount of defaulted student loans			1
in 2010 , total student loan debt exceeded credit card debt			0
it may not be long before this bubble bursts , hurting the very students who need help the most			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			2

@entity165 : lowering interest on student loans does n't bring down college costs
@entity165 : the issue has become the newest political cudgel
he asks : how does president @entity44 plan to pay for the $ 6 billion subsidy ?
