-- he 's regularly voted @entity3 's favorite famous person , but many of the nation 's youth have " no idea " about his glorious sporting past			1
for them , @entity9 is a rock star -- or simply " @entity12 's dad			1
" rock star because the 53 - year - old is a multimillion - selling artist who has regularly played to packed arenas full of 80,000 screaming fans or more			1
@entity12 's dad because his 29 - year - old son is a two - time @entity18 playing for the @entity19 in the @entity20			1
rarely do any youngsters know about his permanent place in tennis folklore , or that he remains the last @entity3 to win a grand slam title			1
but so varied are his interests and so versatile his repertoire , he could also be known as coach , author , humanitarian campaigner or charity fundraiser			2
" most of them have no idea i was a tennis player , " he tells @entity0 's @entity31			2
" i stopped in 1990 which is 23 years ago -- a long time			2
" the time that has flown since has yet to produce a @entity3 capable of assuming @entity9 's mantle , or bettering his highest world ranking of no. 3			1
his trademark dreadlocks and ferocious forehand were melded to a happy - go - lucky attitude , and a genuine sense of fun on the court			2
perhaps that is why his 1983 @entity49 victory in front of a rapturous crowd at @entity52 in @entity53 is still held in such reverence			1
that , and his stint as captain of his country 's @entity59 team in which he led @entity3 's men to their first title in the prestigious competition for 59 years			1
a year after his second triumph as captain , he switched to the @entity66 , skippering @entity3 's ladies to their first crown			1
for tennis fans in @entity3 , he can do no wrong			1
but now it is all about the music , after his impromptu jam sessions with fellow major winners @entity74 and @entity76 -- among others -- spawned a thriving second career path			0
" i just loved it so much i kept doing it , " @entity9 explains			1
" the difference is that once i just wrote on a piece of paper some lyrics and then put some drums , and then this thing became no. 1 and that was an accident			0
" i was not prepared for that			0
i started to do tv shows , write some more songs and the next thing i know i am doing little clubs with my own band			2
" we started to play in tennis events and then one day we had an album that sold millions , so that was a big difference for all of us			1
after a few years preparing , playing clubs , we started to play big venues			0
" this is where @entity9 's prowess as a champion tennis player came to the fore			1
having performed in front of thousands of expectant fans -- no more so than on court at @entity52 in 1983 -- he was used to the acute demands it would bring			2
" the pressure before a game is so much stronger and intense than before you go on the stage ; of course it is pressure , but i mean you are in a locker room playing this other guy , " he says			0
" i am prepared for the pressure as a professional athlete			0
i think you are really prepared for intense pressure because you are under pressure every game			0
you lose and it hurts -- physically , mentally , it hurts			0
you do n't have that in music			0
" competition is not that healthy , i would say			0
while i will be in the same locker room as now when i am going to do the concert and there 's 15,000 people and i hear 10 minutes before the concert people going ' @entity9 , @entity9 ' -- they all came because they love me			1
" and nothing to do with ego , but i know they came because they like me so i 'm going to do my best to make them happy			0
this is my family waiting for me not some other guys just waiting to criticize me and write something in a paper ... i 'm not like this or i missed a backhand down the line			0
" music is supposed to be just fun -- that 's it -- so yes i enjoy it			0
it 's all about passion			0
that 's who i am , if i do n't have passion i am not delivering			0
" passion was a defining characteristic of @entity9 's career on court			1
it permeated his run to the @entity49 final 31 years ago , and was replicated on the streets of @entity53 as the capital rallied round its rising star			1
heading into the tournament seeded at six , @entity9 enjoyed a comfortable passage to the quarterfinals where @entity162 lay in wait			1
like @entity9 , the @entity164 was yet to capture a major title -- he would go on to win eight , including the @entity3 the following year -- but was beaten in four sets			1
by the time @entity9 had brushed aside fellow @entity3 @entity169 in a one - sided semifinal , the wave of national euphoria he was riding made defeat in the final seem inconceivable			1
and when he duly beat @entity174 's @entity173 , a posse of friends and family -- led by @entity9 's father -- rushed on court to celebrate with the champion , who was soon engulfed by a delirious public			1
but despite the reverence in which this iconic moment is held -- he was the first @entity3 to win it since 1946 -- and the fact that @entity9 's defining career moment happened at @entity52 , it is n't a place he relishes returning to			1
" i 've had there the best moments of my life more than 30 years ago -- it 's right here in my heart forever , " he says of his sole grand slam triumph			1
" i have my best moment on tape of my life			0
so every time i see it , every time i think about it i am complete			0
" i do n't need to go back to know the real thing -- i lived it , it 's in my heart , it 's in my memory forever , nobody can take that away from me			2
" but i rather go to the @entity208 or @entity209 incognito , especially now with my short hair -- nobody knows who i am			0
" in @entity3 if i go to @entity52 there is just too much love , i can not walk around so i can not watch a game , i can not watch , i like to walk around , have a beer , it 's impossible			2
" even though i love my @entity49 , i do n't have this luxury			2
" @entity9 's son knows a thing or two about adulation too			2
@entity12 was recently crowned @entity222 in the @entity18 as his @entity19 side were defeated in the first round of the playoffs			0
he 's been playing for the iconic basketball outfit since 2007 and is contracted on a multimillion - dollar deal until the end of 2017			2
" i am proud but i am the happiest father -- how happy can you be when your son is fulfilling and living his dream ? " says @entity9 , whose father was a footballer from @entity230 who played for @entity3 clubs			1
" every time i see him getting introduced , i get emotional , i get tears in my eyes			0
" i always go back to this little kid who said , ' one day i will play on the @entity18			2
' i said ' yeah kid ' but then he kept trying , posters all over his bedroom , basketball players , watching tapes , playing all the time , not being so good but always this passion			0
" when i see @entity12 today -- all @entity18 , @entity19 center -- i see my baby with this same passion			0
" passion is a word that proliferates @entity9 's vocabulary , even when talking about the current state of men 's tennis in @entity3			1
there are four @entity3 players in the top 30 ahead of the @entity260 , which starts sunday			2
so who does he think has the best chance to emulate his victory ? " i 'm going to surprise you , i think ( @entity266 ) @entity266 can do it , " he says of the world no. 24			0
" from what i know he 's not working as hard as he should on a regular basis			0
he can work hard and then he gives up for a while			0
but i think he 's the one who could have the opportunity to beat these beasts , ( @entity275 ) @entity274 and ( @entity277 ) @entity276			0
" to win the @entity49 you have to understand you have to beat not one of these guys but two of them			1
