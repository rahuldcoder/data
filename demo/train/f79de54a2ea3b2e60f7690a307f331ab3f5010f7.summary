-- four more arrests have been made in connection over the death of a @entity5 volunteer soccer official who was allegedly beaten by teenage players at an amateur game earlier this month			1
@entity5 police said tuesday they had arrested two 16 - year - olds , a 17 - year - old and a 50 - year - old man			1

there are now a total of eight people in custody following the arrest of four teenagers last week , and @entity5 police have asked for anyone with photos or video recordings of the attack to come forward			1
if convicted of charges of manslaughter and assault , the two 15 - year - olds in detention would serve a maximum sentence of one year in a youth prison -- while the 16 - year - olds could be jailed for up to two years , unless judges rule that they should be treated as adults			1

@entity19 's death has resonated across the globe , with @entity56 president @entity55 among those extending condolences			2
" football is a mirror of society , and sadly the same ills that afflict society -- in this case violence -- also manifest themselves in our game , " the head of world soccer said in a statement on @entity56 's website			0
" nevertheless , i remain convinced that football -- through the example set by the tireless efforts of people like mr. @entity19 -- is a force for good , and we must continue to use its positive example to educate people against these wrongs			0
" despite a relatively small population of 17.5 million , @entity79 has built an outstanding reputation for developing young footballers over the years , with its amateur youth clubs providing a strong breeding ground for the country 's professional clubs .			0
