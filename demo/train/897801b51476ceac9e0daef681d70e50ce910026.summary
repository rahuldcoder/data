@entity0 , @entity1 -- it is impossible to get used to			1
the roar of a jet overhead , the hum of helicopter blades hovering around your block , the sudden thud of a blast			1
when you hear it , at least you know you are safe			2
yet this has become daily life for residents of @entity0			1
people living in rebel held territory , among whom the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) mingle , and upon whom the @entity1 regime 's wrath is visited			2
the blasts continue throughout the day and also haunt the night			0
there is no perceivable pattern as to where they strike , for they do n't appear to aim themselves at the few targets the @entity21 present			1
their timing is also hard to follow : they hit most at dawn and dusk , yes , but the shells are sometimes few , sometimes sustained			0
and above all , they do n't follow a pattern that suggests the artillery weapons are trying to hit - and - miss their way towards an objective			1
they simply fire , strike , and then move to a completely different place altogether			1
the only pattern to divine is that there is really no pattern , unless your aim is to terrify			1
that objective is simple when your target is an unarmed civilian population , defended at times by an often motley and ramshackle rebel army			1
the easiest way to discern there is trouble overhead is to see residents straining their necks upwards			0
a sniper 's bullet , a dying child and a family 's desperation one morning at 6 a.m. , shells and rockets slammed into the @entity70 neighborhood of @entity0			1
in one home , 12 people from the same extended family were huddled , mostly asleep			1
the rockets slammed into the roof , bringing the second floor down onto the first			2
we arrived four hours after the strike , once the neighborhood had had time to react and begun to dig its way into the rubble			1
it was a crowd of locals -- fathers and neighbors -- horrified at what was happening to their homes and community			2
the @entity21 stood around to rally vehicles to take away the wounded			0
the digging was furious : hands and shovels trying to prize away huge slabs of dusty concrete			0
faces covered in dust , frantic groups of men trying to be large enough in number to get the job done but small enough to leave space to work in the cramped confines of a half - collapsed building			1
there is panic and frenzy , but finally a flurry of cries			0
" @entity113 , " as they see a limb			0
then a leg , eventually the limp body of a little girl pulled from the rubble			1
a blanket is rushed forwards to cover her face : they are too late , and preserving her dignity in death is all they can do			0
the search continues amid the endless threat that the helicopters which fired the original rockets may strike again and the risk that the building 's half - filled second floor might cave in entirely			1
when buildings collapse , the dead are often found in groups , huddled in the same room where they sleep			0
in this case , the father is found shortly after the daughter			0
a woman outside the rubble screams : " i swear to @entity144 we have been destroyed			2
i swear to @entity144 , @entity145 is killing us "			0
but the bodies kept coming , 11 dead in total , nine of them children			1
they are rushed by the furious @entity21 to the hospital , the children placed under blankets and laid in the back of a pickup truck			0
aged from four to 11			2
@entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157			0
one of their fathers is too distraught to name all the dead -- two related families , one of which had gone to visit the other			0
but amid the incomprehensible brutality , the people in this corner of @entity0 find a gift			1
he is barely a year old and called @entity170			0
he was pulled from the rubble , a simple act of care having saved his life			1
@entity170 's mother , @entity175 , was breastfeeding him when the rockets struck			2
@entity175 was killed by the rubble , but her body sheltered @entity170			2
he is brought to the hospital , the men cursing @entity1 president @entity145 as a " dog " and hoping @entity170 will live to see him hanged			0
they tear off his dusty clothes and clean his body , a symbol of their perseverance			0
born into this bloody and continuing revolution , they pray he will grow up in a very different @entity1			0
inside @entity1 : bombs , road blocks and ice cream video by photojournalist @entity193 .			2

pattern of @entity0 attacks appears *designed* to terrify civilians rather than target rebels
in one strike rockets collapsed a two - story building with an extended family inside
locals pulled 11 bodies from the rubble and one baby *survivor*
the baby *boy* was apparently protected from the blast by his mom as she breastfed him
