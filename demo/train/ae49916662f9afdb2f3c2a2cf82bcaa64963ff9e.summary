testifying before @entity2 on wednesday , gen. @entity0 , director of the @entity1 , asserted that his agency 's massive acquisition of @entity6 phone data and the contents of overseas internet traffic that is provided by @entity6 tech companies has helped prevent " dozens of terrorist events			1
" on thursday , sens. @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity11 who both serve on the @entity14 and have access to the nation 's most sensitive secrets , released a statement contradicting this assertion			2
" gen. @entity0 's testimony yesterday suggested that the @entity1 's bulk phone records collection program helped thwart ' dozens ' of terrorist attacks , but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods , " the two senators said			1
indeed , a survey of court documents and media accounts of all the jihadist terrorist plots in the @entity6 since 9/11 by the @entity34 shows that traditional law enforcement methods have overwhelmingly played the most significant role in foiling terrorist attacks			1
this suggests that the @entity1 surveillance programs are wide - ranging fishing expeditions with little to show for them			1
@entity0 promised during his congressional testimony that during this coming week more information would be forthcoming about how the @entity1 surveillance programs have prevented many attacks			1
a @entity6 intelligence document provided to @entity46 by a congressional source over the weekend asserts that the dragnet of @entity6 phone data and internet information from overseas users " has contributed to the disruption of dozens of potential terrorist plots here in the homeland and in more than 20 countries around the world			2
" the public record , which is quite rich when it comes to jihadist terrorism cases , suggests that the @entity1 surveillance yielded little of major value to prevent numerous attacks in the @entity6 , but government officials may be able to point to a number of attacks that were averted overseas			1
that may not do much to dampen down the political firestorm that has gathered around the @entity1 surveillance programs			1
after all , these have been justified because they have supposedly helped to keep @entity6 safe at home			2
homegrown jihadist extremists have mounted 42 plots to conduct attacks within the @entity6 since 2001			0
of those plots , nine involved an actual terrorist act that was not prevented by any type of government action , such as the failed attempt by @entity80 to blow up a car bomb in @entity82 on may 1 , 2010			2
of the remaining 33 plots , the public record shows that at least 29 were uncovered by traditional law enforcement methods , such as the use of informants , reliance on community tips about suspicious activity and other standard policing practices			1
informants have played a critical role in preventing more than half of the plots by homegrown jihadist extremists since the 9/11 attacks , according to @entity34 data			0
for instance , a group of @entity100 from the @entity101 living in southern @entity102 who were virulently opposed to the @entity104 told a government informant in 2007 they were plotting to kill soldiers stationed at the nearby @entity109 army base			0
other investigations have relied on tips to law enforcement			1
@entity115 student @entity114 's plot to attack a variety of targets in @entity118 in 2011 , including president @entity120 's home in @entity121 , was foiled when a company reported his attempt to buy chemicals suitable for making explosives			0
standard police work has also stopped plots			0
@entity128 , a convert to @entity129 , formed a group dedicated to holy war while he was jailed in @entity133 's @entity132 during the late 1990s			0
@entity128 ' crew planned to attack a @entity6 military recruiting station in @entity136 on the fourth anniversary of 9/11 as well as a synagogue a month later			0
members of @entity128 ' group financed their activities by sticking up gas stations , and their plans only came to light during the course of a routine investigation of a gas station robbery by local police in @entity149 , @entity133 , who found documents that laid out the group 's plans for mayhem			0
in defending the role of @entity1 surveillance in his congressional testimony , @entity0 pointed to two plots averted by his agency 's programs ; the plan by @entity163 resident @entity162 to bomb the @entity165 subway system in 2009 and a plot the same year by @entity168 resident @entity167 to attack the offices of a @entity171 newspaper that had printed cartoons of the @entity173 that many @entity100 deemed offensive			1
in the @entity162 case , testimony in a @entity176 court shows that around the eighth anniversary of 9/11 , @entity6 officials found an e-mail address in @entity181 , believed to be connected to @entity182 , that was in communication with @entity184 , an e-mail address in the @entity163 area			0
officials found that @entity162 was e-mailing from njbzaz@yahoo.com to get clarification from his handlers in @entity181 about how to mix ingredients for the bombs he was building in his @entity163 apartment			0
@entity162 was arrested before he could carry out his plan to attack the @entity165 subways			0
this plot could well have been detected by the @entity1 's @entity197 , which collects the e-mails and other records of computer users outside the @entity6 from nine @entity6 technology companies , including @entity202			2
but the detection of the plot does not appear to have anything to do with the government 's collection of the phone records of tens of millions of @entity6			0
in the case of @entity167 , the government has n't clarified its claim that @entity1 surveillance led to his detection , but @entity215 of @entity216 , who has done the most authoritative reporting on the @entity167 case , says that @entity167 came to the attention of @entity6 officials because he was in contact with @entity182 operatives in the @entity222 who were under surveillance by the @entity222			1
in other words , @entity167 was not detected by @entity1 surveillance but because of a tip from a close ally			1
moreover , conventional law enforcement methods were available to detect @entity167 's ties to terrorism , but they were ignored			2
@entity167 's wife warned the @entity231 of his involvement with the @entity181 - based militant group @entity233 years before his plot to attack the @entity171 newspaper .			0

@entity1 chief says @entity1 has prevented " dozens of terrorist events "
@entity240 says publicly available information *minimizes* value of @entity1 surveillance
@entity244 : most *effective* weapons against terror are traditional law enforcement techniques
