@entity1 troops , security forces and tanks surged into @entity4 on sunday as political turmoil deepened over who should lead the country			1
military tanks were deployed to several neighborhoods in central @entity4 , two @entity1 police officials told @entity11			1
the officials said there are also significantly more troops in @entity4 's @entity15 , the secure area where many government buildings , the military headquarters and the @entity18 are located			1
the stepped - up troop presence comes as @entity1 forces battle @entity22 militants in northern @entity1 , and just after prime minister @entity23 accused @entity24 , @entity1 's newly elected president , of violating the country 's constitution by extending the deadline for @entity1 's biggest political coalitions to nominate a candidate for prime minister			1
the precise reason for the growing number of troops in the @entity1 capital was unclear			1
but @entity11 military analyst retired lt. col. @entity36 described it as an " ominous " development that signals the @entity1 prime minister does n't want to hand over power			1
" you 've got @entity23 refusing to step down			2
now he 's mobilized not just security troops loyal to him , but now he 's mobilized army units to put tanks in the streets			1
some of the bridges have been closed , " @entity36 said			0
" it looks like he 's trying to lock down the city in some sort of confrontation with the president , so this does not portend well			1
" retired @entity54 gen. @entity53 said the stepped up security could also be a response to advances by militants from @entity59 , the @entity60 extremist group that has now declared itself the @entity61			0
" it could be a show of force			0
if you 're talking about protecting government buildings , there may be a sense that @entity59 forces may be closer than everybody thinks at this point , and so depending on what the undercurrent in @entity4 right now , that could be a great sign for concern , " @entity53 said			0
" but it may also be a concern that there 's a coup afoot			0
" @entity11 's @entity79 said @entity23 could be digging in his heels for a political battle			2
" it 's not in his dna to go without a fight			0
this is a man who 's really feeling besieged at the moment			0
he 's cornered on all sides , if you like , " @entity79 said			0
" he 's got @entity59 on his doorstep , in a military sense			0
he even had the @entity93 the other day saying politicians should not cling to their posts			0
but this is a guy who seizes onto power			0
" in a televised speech sunday , @entity23 said he would file a complaint against @entity24 for allegedly violating @entity1 's constitution			1
lawmakers elected @entity24 , a veteran @entity104 politician who 's been a member of the @entity1 parliament since 2005 , to the presidency last month			1
choosing a prime minister is a key next step for @entity1 's leaders			1
critics of @entity23 have called for him to pull his name out of the running , but he 's repeatedly refused			2
@entity23 and his @entity114 - dominated government have been under enormous international pressure to be more inclusive of the country 's minority @entity60 population , who say they have been marginalized and cut out of the political process			2
@entity122 administration officials have talked repeatedly about how their priority is a political settlement that creates a more inclusive government in @entity1			2
a deadline to agree on a new prime minister had been set for last week and was extended on sunday			1
in a statement sunday , @entity129 spokeswoman @entity128 said the @entity131 is closely monitoring the situation and supports @entity1 's president			1
" the @entity131 fully supports president @entity24 in his role as guarantor of the @entity1 constitution , " she said			1
" we reaffirm our support for a process to select a prime minister who can represent the aspirations of the @entity1 people by building a national consensus and governing in an inclusive manner			1
we reject any effort to achieve outcomes through coercion or manipulation of the constitutional or judicial process			0
" @entity131 officials who put their faith in @entity23 for years may have misjudged him , @entity36 said			2
" most people thought that there would be this peaceful transition to the new government			0
he served for two terms , " @entity36 said			0
" now he 's refusing to step down			0
... this looks very bad , like he 's going to refuse to go			0
" @entity1 's @entity140 defiantly says he 'll stay amid @entity59 threat			2

@entity129 says it supports @entity1 president @entity24
military tanks are deployed to several @entity4 neighborhoods , officials say
police officials say more troops have entered @entity4 's @entity15
it looks like prime minister @entity23 is " trying to lock down the city , " analyst says
