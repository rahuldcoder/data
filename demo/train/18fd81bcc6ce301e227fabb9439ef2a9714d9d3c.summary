-- last year , " @entity16 " became a breakout hit for @entity2 , turning @entity4 's fantasy novel into an epic show that pleased diehard fans of the book while pulling in a wider audience with ample servings of sex , violence and intrigue to rival " @entity13 , " " @entity14 " and " @entity15			1
" and when season 2 debuts sunday , viewers can expect more of the same			2
the second book in @entity4 's epic series , " @entity22 , " is called " @entity28 , " and that , in a nutshell , sets the table for what to expect in the show 's sophomore outing			1
show - runners have promised that everything gets ratcheted up in season 2			1
epic battles ( largely kept off screen because of cost concerns in season 1 ) will unfold before our eyes			2
even more characters will emerge as players ( or pawns ) in the so - called @entity22 , and the world will get bigger as key characters travel throughout the kingdom of @entity43 and beyond			1
all of which threatens to get a touch confusing for folks who have n't already delved into @entity4 's novels -- a series that has spanned 16 years and five books , with two more promised			1
so here 's a quick look at where season 1 left off and , with a bit of insight from the novels , some hints at what to expect as the tale continues to unfold			1
the players @entity61 : the nasty brat @entity61 sits on the @entity63			0
a @entity61 in name only , the sniveling teen king represents the hopes of the immensely wealthy @entity68 clan , most notably his mother , @entity69			0
but the little - known fact that he 's actually not late @entity72 's son , instead the inbred offspring of @entity69 and brother @entity74 , has given hope to his challengers			1
@entity77 : after his father , @entity78 , was beheaded at @entity61 's command , @entity77 called his troops and headed south , seeking both revenge and the return of his sisters , @entity84 and @entity85			2
along the way , his followers crowned him @entity72 in the @entity88 , essentially seceding from the @entity63 of @entity43			0
with the counsel of his mother , @entity90 , he 's had great success on the battlefield , taking renowned warrior @entity68 hostage in the process			2
but he finds himself turned off by the political machinations that come with his new title , not the least of which being the promise of an arranged marriage			2
@entity99 : @entity101 's youngest brother , @entity100 , is charismatic and a familiar face at @entity63 , where he was an adviser to his brother			2
when season 1 ended , he and ... ahem ... special friend @entity105 , the @entity104 , have fled the capital with hopes of returning to claim the throne			1
unfortunately , even if @entity61 is deemed illegitimate , @entity111 is not technically next in line , that status instead going to ... @entity113 : @entity113 was an offscreen presence throughout season 1			2
ill - suited for the niceties of royal life , @entity113 is the polar opposite of @entity111 in appearance and demeanor			0
but as @entity72 's oldest brother , he has the better claim			0
as @entity122 emerges , he 'll introduce us to one of the story 's most enigmatic characters			0
yes , @entity43 is roughly equivalent to medieval @entity127			0
but magic exists as well			0
@entity129 : @entity129 provided the first season 's dramatic conclusion , emerging from what appeared to be deadly flames with three hatchling dragons			1
she 's the daughter of the " @entity72 " who @entity72 deposed			0
but season 2 finds her stranded across the @entity138 , and most of deceased husband @entity141 's followers having deserted her			1
she 's not a player in the current struggle for @entity43			1
but ... you know ... she 's got dragons			0
@entity147 readers may have noted that list only includes four kings -- hardly enough for what 's called the @entity22			1
rest assured ... treachery , backstabbing and old wounds will remedy that soon enough			0
meanwhile , back at the @entity153 while the powers - that - be to the south fight amongst themselves , @entity154 and his sworn brothers of the @entity156 are the only ones aware of the threat from the mysterious @entity161 and increasingly restless wildlings to the north			0
having returned to the @entity153 after nearly abandoning his post to fight beside half - brother @entity77 , @entity154 has joined a band of watchmen making the dangerous trip beyond to seek out his lost uncle , @entity168 , and try to learn more about the growing threat			0
season 2 will open @entity154 's eyes to a whole new world and bring changes for @entity174 , the portly and cowardly brother @entity154 protected and befriended , as well			1
whom to watch in @entity4 's world , a relatively minor character can re-emerge as a major player , sometimes long after they 're introduced			1
obviously , @entity122 will become important as he stakes his royal claim			0
also keep an eye on @entity181			0
@entity183 's ward at @entity184 only emerged from the background a few times but will become important as the story moves along			0
new characters also will appear thoughout the season , notably @entity189 ( a warrior woman and arguably one of the tale 's most sympathetic characters ) and @entity193 of @entity194 ( a priestess of far more dubious motivations )			2
and what of @entity198 ? fresh off an @entity199 , @entity200 has become a fan favorite as @entity198 , the dwarf brother of the tall , strong and beautiful @entity68 clan			1
having survived captivity at the hand of the @entity205 and then what should have been a suicide battle mission ( ordered by his own father , @entity208 ) , @entity198 will find himself at the heart of the intrigue at @entity63			1
look for him ( man - at - arms @entity211 and companion @entity212 in tow ) to play a more central role in the power struggle , even as his love - hate ( ok ... usually hate - hate ) relationship with sister @entity218 and father @entity208 continues to simmer .			0

second season of " @entity16 " promises more intrigue , *bloodshed*
*multiple* contenders vie for the throne as war looms in @entity228
emmy - winner @entity200 's character , @entity198 , becomes a political player
the @entity2 series is based on @entity4 's " @entity22 " novels
