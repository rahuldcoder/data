-- when @entity5 temple gunman @entity4 arrived at @entity6 in 1995 , the sprawling @entity2 base in @entity3 already was home to a small number of white supremacists including three soldiers later convicted in the murder of an @entity13 couple			1
the killings launched a military investigation that tightened regulations against extremist activity , but some say such influences persist in today 's armed forces			1
" outside every major military installation , you will have at least two or three active @entity29 organizations actively trying to recruit on - duty personnel , " said @entity21 , a former white power skinhead in the @entity23 who now conducts anti-extremism training			1
' swimming upstream , ' white supremacist groups still strong page died in a shootout with police responding to his attack sunday on a @entity37 temple in the @entity39 suburb of @entity40 that killed six people and wounded four , including a police officer			1
he had ties to white supremacist groups and the @entity44 acknowledges it knew of him , though no formal investigation ever took place			0
according to @entity48 , a @entity49 criminologist who knew page , the military experience at @entity6 helped instill @entity4 's allegiance to the white power movement			1
" what he told me during the course of our time together was that he really started to identify with the neo-nazism during his time in the military , " said @entity53 , who met @entity4 in 2001 while doing a study on white power groups in @entity56			1
" and specifically , what he told me at one point was that , if you join the military and you 're not a racist , then you certainly will be by the time you leave			1
" in particular , @entity53 told @entity0 , @entity4 's military experience bolstered his perception that " the deck was stacked against whites			1
" " he came to feel that there was preferential treatment for @entity13 in the military and whites were always on the short end of the stick , " @entity53 continued			2
" and the more he got into the @entity81 ideology , the more he came to see all of society in that way			2
" while @entity4 knew about neo-nazis and racist skinheads before joining the @entity2 , " he really started getting into it during his time in the military , " said @entity53 , author of " @entity87 : inside the @entity89 's @entity88			1
" opinion : hate with a beat -- @entity93 power music @entity4 joined the @entity2 in 1992 and ended up at @entity6 in 1995 , around the time that the base became the focus of white extremism in the military when three members of the @entity99 stationed there were arrested in connection with the murder of an @entity13 couple in nearby @entity104			1
investigators found neo-nazi materials in the barracks of the men , and all three were eventually convicted			1
the case prompted a military review that determined 22 soldiers at the base had past or present links to skinhead groups , though investigators concluded there was no organized extremist movement operating among the more than 14,000 troops of the @entity99 at the time			1
those who served with page say he showed racist tendencies then			1
" he was involved with white supremacy			0
he talked about the racial holy war a lot , " said @entity123 , who met @entity4 at @entity6 in 1995 when both were doing psychological operations training			1
while describing page as a close friend and a kind person , @entity123 also said that " when he 'd rant , it would be about mostly any non-white person			2
" " i know everyone is going to paint him as a racist with hatred , but that 's not how i remember him , " @entity123 said			0
" the racial holy war talk i always took as something he would vent about , and not act on it			2
i never pictured him as someone who would do anything			0
i thought maybe he was just saying it for attention			0
" to @entity149 , a counterterrorism analyst and editor for @entity151 , the military attracts extremists because of the weapons training it provides			2
" one thing that we really have to keep in mind is that extremists are often explicitly interested in joining the military because they get training that they can use later , " @entity149 told @entity0 , adding that " there have been some explicit discussions among leaders of some of these groups that their followers should join the @entity2 to get trained			2
" in talking to military veterans , @entity149 said , he hears " different things from different people			2
" " some say that there 's not a massive problem			0
others have expressed concern to me about what they 've seen in the ranks , " he continued			0
" and , you know , the military is a massive operation like the @entity182 population			2
there are going to be some people who are problems			0
" @entity187 killings put spotlight on ' hate rock ' @entity4 received a general discharge under honorable conditions from the @entity2 in 1998 due to " discreditable incidents , " according to a @entity194 official who spoke on condition of not being identified			1
@entity123 said @entity4 showed up drunk for duty one morning , which led to his eventual discharge			1
the two men parted ways until 2000 , when @entity4 visited @entity123 at his home in @entity202			1
" he had gone through a dramatic change , " @entity123 said of the meeting , the last time he saw @entity4 in person			1
" his talk about the racist war was ... more like he really did believe it			0
" @entity21 , the former white supremacist who wrote the book " @entity211 : from hate to @entity214 , " said he openly displayed his extremist leanings while serving in the @entity23 in the late 1980s			0
" i used to hang a swastika flag on my wall locker and everybody in my unit all the way up to my commander knew it , " he said			0
" the only time they ever asked me to take it down was when the commanding general would come through , just so they would n't get in trouble			0
and afterwards , i would put it right back up and they were perfectly fine with it			0
" he noted that his brother 's unit had less tolerance for such displays			0
" his commanding officer went to the barracks and anything that was racist or seemed to be racist , he made them send it home , " @entity21 said			0
" so it really depends on the commanding officers and who 's in charge of that base			0
" after the 1995 murder case involving the three @entity6 soldiers , the @entity2 appointed a task force to investigate the extent of white supremacists in its ranks and also started including training against extremism			1
white supremacist group member pleads guilty according to the @entity194 website , the task force visited 28 installations and interviewed more than 7,500 soldiers			2
it found that less than 1 % said they had seen soldiers or civilian employees involved with extremist groups			0
a decade later , the @entity265 reported in 2006 that some high - profile members of extremist groups were serving in the @entity182 military			0
according to the organization , which tracks hate groups in the @entity182 , the presence of extremists in the military increased with the need to bolster ranks for the wars in @entity277 and @entity278			0
