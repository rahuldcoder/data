@entity0 , @entity1 -- they 're cramped , loud and seem to care little about the rules of the road -- more than just a mode of transportation , riding a " tro - tro " is an experience of its own , a roller coaster ride that any self - respecting visitor to @entity0 should check off their list			1
the crammed , hot and often rickety minivans , also called " troskies , " are the most popular way of getting around in the @entity1 capital			0
they can be picked up from a station or by the roadside and they typically seat around 15 squished passengers , sometimes even more , as they swerve , zigzag and rush through @entity0 's busy streets			2
read this : forget @entity27 , fall in love with @entity0 but while tro - tro rides might not be the ideal travel option for the claustrophobic , they 're certainly more appealing to anyone looking to navigate the city cheaply			1
just like " matatus " in @entity36 , and many other similar means of transport in urban centers across the continent , tro - tros fill the public demand for affordable trips -- the fee a tro - tro ride around @entity0 is never more than a few cents , paid before or on arrival			1
" if you really want to get to know a city , do n't take a taxi -- take a tro - tro , " says @entity0 commuter @entity46			1
so how does the tro - tro system work and what can you expect once you catch a ride ? @entity55 might have set routes but in the absence of a fixed schedule -- the vans depart only once they 're full -- waiting times can be lengthy			1
boarding the right one can also be confusing , especially if you 're picking it up from the roadside			0
read this : artists take epic @entity36 road trip in those cases , what 's needed is a mixture of cunning and alertness , coupled with determination and some insider knowledge			0
as the tro - tro approaches , the fare collector , or " mate , " hangs out the right side door , shouting the destination and making a sign to indicate the van 's direction			1
you do the same and , with a little a bit of luck , the driver stops so you can hop on			0
sometimes , however , securing a spot requires a more physical approach			0
" when you have a situation with 10 , 15 , up to 20 people trying to enter the same door at the same time , that 's when you see the magic happening , " says @entity46			2
" people opening up the top of the car , sliding in the side screen and then jumping into the car			0
then you 'll see the car start to move with someone halfway in the car , with their legs dangling outside of the car , and that is just crazy ! " once en route , forget about seat belts or spacious seating ; you can expect , however , a bumpy ride that 's often made easier by the inevitable mix of shared laughs , heated debates and social commentary -- as well as a bit of singing			2
" the driver of the tro - tro was singing the entire time , it could actually be that his part - time job was in the choir because he was singing a lot of hymns , " recalls @entity0 commuter @entity112 of one memorable journey			1
" he was really entertaining for everyone in the car -- people started singing along and it was actually a really fun journey for me			2
" " @entity127 " at least four million people live in and around @entity0 , making it one of @entity36 's largest cities			1
its infrastructure is like many other @entity133 urban centers : aged from the colonial era and unable to keep up with the demands of a burgeoning population			0
as more @entity1 jump behind the wheel -- thanks to a growing middle class and cheaper imports from overseas -- the city 's streets are often clogged with snail - paced traffic			2
read this : @entity36 's new skyscraper cities " you have an experience where you sit in a tro - tro tightly packed and it 's just before work so you can imagine the kind of pressure it puts on you , " says @entity146 , the creator of @entity127 , an online platform where people share their often - funny stories about their daily transport woes			1
" we realized people go through so much stress to get to their offices , which might affect their output , " says @entity146			0
" we put a bit of humor in there , where people in different tro - tros all over @entity1 and even in other parts of the world share their experience			1
now what this will do is it will help to lighten their mood , so when they get to the office they actually get there in a happier mood and be able to deliver			0
" encouraged by friends , @entity146 , a 27 - year - old business development manager at an automotive company , created a blog and a @entity186 group and today more than 1,000 people use the @entity127 platform to sound off			1
" aah , i really hate it when people are in singing in ( the ) troskie , " reads one comment			0
" i 'm like , this is not your car , dude ! " " she has been talking for about 30 minutes non-stop ! " says another @entity127 user			2
" i guess the radio stations need her talent ! " @entity146 says he now plans to also create a @entity127 app that will also serve to help commuters find their way easier around the city			2
he believes that creating information networks for @entity1 on - the - go , as well as making them laugh with each other , can have a positive impact			0
" ( the future of @entity1 is ) in the hands of the youth and we 're already taking it , " he says			0
" we are crazy for change and we want to put that change into @entity1 because @entity1 is for all of us and we need to make things work			0
