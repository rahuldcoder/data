-- @entity3 's @entity2 spaceship splashed down saturday in the @entity4 , returning from a four - week resupply mission to the @entity6 and bringing back a valuable payload of potentially groundbreaking experiments			1
@entity2 , an unmanned spacecraft , successfully came down about 300 miles west of @entity11 just after 3:30 p.m. est , carrying a return load weighing 3,276 pounds , @entity9 said in a press release			2
@entity2 was expected to be hauled to a port near @entity15 where some of the cargo would be removed almost immediately , the space agency said , while the rest of the research aboard the rocket will return to @entity3 's facility at @entity22 , @entity23 , for further processing			1
@entity3 is a private company that has contracted with @entity9 to fly missions to the @entity6 since @entity9 retired its shuttle fleet in 2011			1
" this mission enabled research critical to achieving @entity9 's goal of long - duration human spaceflight in deep space , " said @entity27 , director of the @entity6 division at @entity29			1
one of the experiments scientists are hoping yields information to help further deep space exploration involves mice			2
it 's called the @entity40 - 1			2
part of that experiment has returned aboard the @entity2			0
the study focuses on " ongoing research on how microgravity affects animals , providing information relevant to human spaceflight , discoveries in basic biology and knowledge that may directly affect human health on @entity47 , @entity9 said			1
@entity2 also delivered a 3 - d printer to the @entity6 during its mission , to test the ability to produce parts cheaply and on demand , and a device called the @entity60 that will measure the winds on the @entity47 's oceans for climate and weather research			1
" the delivery of the @entity66 advances our understanding of @entity47 science , and the 3 - d printer will enable a critical technology demonstration , " @entity27 said			1
also critical to extended space travel is a dependable food supply			0
a study on arugula plant growth returned aboard the @entity2			0
the research hopes to determine the impact of various nutrients and microgravity on seedlings from the leafy vegetable that are grown in space			0
scientists hope the experiment will help them learn the best ways to grow plants in space with the highest nutritional content			0
@entity2 delivered a total of 255 science experiments to the @entity6 during its fourth of 12 planned @entity3 resupply missions to the space station through 2016			1
the next @entity3 flight is set to lift off sometime after december 1			0
it will also deliver crew supplies and cargo to the @entity6 , including @entity97 , the @entity98			0
@entity97 is a laser instrument that will measure clouds and particles in the atmosphere , including pollution , dust and smoke			0
@entity9 recently announced it was awarding $ 6.8 billion contracts to @entity3 and @entity107 to shuttle cargo and astronauts to and from the iss. since @entity9 's space shuttle program was retired in 2011 , astronauts have been hitching rides on the @entity114 spacecraft , at a cost of $ 70 million per seat			1
both @entity107 and @entity3 's crafts will go through a certification process first			2
the target date to begin manned missions is 2017			0
@entity0 's @entity120 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 's @entity2 successfully returns from fourth @entity6 resupply mission
@entity9 : @entity125 carried critical research for human space exploration
@entity2 delivered 3 - d printer and device to measure @entity47 's ocean winds
next mission could come before year 's end
