-- it started with an overnight flight and a thunderstorm -- it finished with a place at the top end of the leaderboard			2
@entity7 would dearly love to win the @entity8 , having finished as runner - up on five occasions , but not even the lure of @entity12 was enough to keep him away from his daughter 's eighth - grade graduation			1
the four - time major champion missed the practice rounds on tuesday and wednesday to be with daughter @entity17 in @entity18 before flying through the night on his private jet to @entity20			1
arriving in @entity21 at 4.15 a.m. thursday morning , @entity7 easily made his 7.11 a.m. tee time and produced his lowest round in the @entity8 since 1999 -- which came just days before @entity17 was born -- with a three - under - par 67			1
it gave him the clubhouse lead , and when the rest of the field had finally finished their rounds friday he had a one - shot advantage over @entity32 's former world no. 1 @entity31			1
" i loved having an early tee time , " @entity7 , whose round was halted by a lengthy delay due to heavy rain , told reporters			1
" i wish we did not have the delay because it made it a long day but the golf course is playing about as easy as it could , but @entity12 is fighting hard			0
" it 's one of the best i 've seen for a @entity8			2
it 's soft but we are having a hard time getting under par. " the 42 - year - old also insisted his preparation for the tournament has not been undermined by spending time back in @entity18			2
" when i was here the week before i was able to do all the work i needed , the last part was getting my game sharp so being able to do that in nice weather on a good practice facility was advantageous			0
" a weather break of three hours and 32 minutes meant an inauspicious start to the 113th @entity8 , being hosted by @entity12 for the first time in 32 years			1
the thursday morning starters managed just 111 minutes of play before torrential rain hit the course and forced play to be suspended			0
@entity31 , seeking his first major title , had been four under but dropped two shots in his last three holes after coming back to finish his round friday			1
big - hitting @entity68 @entity67 was tied for third after completing a 69 on friday , alongside @entity71 surprise package @entity69 -- ranked 398th in the world			2
former masters winner @entity73 shot 70 to be tied for fifth with fellow @entity76 @entity75 , @entity78 @entity77 and @entity79 , @entity81 @entity80 and @entity82 plus @entity84 @entity83 , @entity32 's former world no. 1 @entity85 and veteran @entity87 @entity86			1
defending champion @entity88 completed a 71 to be in a big group including 2012 @entity90 winner @entity90 and his @entity78 @entity93 teammates @entity91 and @entity94 -- that trio finished their rounds on thursday			0
@entity81 's @entity98 champion @entity98 had been tied with @entity7 after 11 holes on thursday , but carded three bogeys and a double to slump to a 72			2
world no. 3 @entity98 was playing with no. 1 @entity103 , who was two over after 10 holes thursday , and no. 2 @entity105 -- tied for 16th on even par through 11			1
woods , who shrugged off suggestions he had seriously hurt his wrist while hitting out of the rough , added two bogeys and a birdie to sign for a 73			0
" my left arm did n't feel too good on a few shots but overall it was not too bad a round , " he told reporters			0
" i missed a load of putts			0
" @entity105 , the 2011 @entity8 winner , had the same score after dropping shots at three of his last four holes friday			1
meanwhile , @entity123 revealed he was heckled by " a couple of guys " during his opening round of 73			0
his jibe last month that he would invite @entity103 round for " fried chicken " during the @entity8 led to an immediate and unreserved apology from the @entity130 , who denied it was racially motivated			1
woods took to @entity133 to register his disappointment with the remarks , calling them " wrong , hurtful and clearly inappropriate			0
" the two men shook hands on monday and @entity123 has sent @entity103 a note , but he confirmed he had yet to hear from the @entity78			0
woods , 37 has not won a major since he won the @entity8 at @entity140 in 2008 where he defeated @entity141 on a playoff while playing with a broken leg			0
a 15th major victory would take him to within three of all - time record of 18 set by @entity146 , whose final triumph came at the 1986 masters at @entity149 .			0
