@entity0 , @entity1 -- few defending champions in sport have had as much to defend as the @entity6 women 's basketball team			1
on tuesday night , the @entity7 successfully defended their title ( beating @entity9 53 - 47 ) , their winning streak ( 78 games ) and themselves ( against the charge that they 're " bad " for women 's basketball )			1
they are so much better than every other team , goes the argument of various scribes , yakkers and bloggers , that they 've made a mockery of the game			2
never mind that these very pundits have mocked the game for years			0
perhaps that 's @entity6 's real crime : it 's made a mockery of others ' mockery			2
i once mocked women 's basketball -- and thank @entity31 i did			1
after i 'd written a single line casually ridiculing women 's basketball in the pages of @entity36 , a woman confronted me in a bar in @entity38			1
she asked me how many games i 'd attended before forming my low opinion of the sport			2
my armpits burst into flames , and i said that i 'd never actually been to a women 's basketball game			2
she invited me to one , and 23 months later , i married that woman , @entity46 , who won a national championship with an unbeaten @entity6 team in 1995 and a gold medal at the @entity50 in 1996 and who helped to launch the @entity52 in 1997 as a member of the @entity54			2
i 'm not saying critics are wrong : perhaps @entity6 is bad for the sport , the way @entity57 was bad for horse racing when he won the @entity60 by 31 lengths , or the way the @entity63 diminished pop music by releasing 20 no. 1 hits , or the way @entity68 's diversity of talents -- artist , engineer , inventor , etc. -- rendered the @entity73 irredeemably dull			1
or perhaps exceptional talent and overriding excellence , over time , raises the level of everyone in its proximity , in which case this @entity6 team might be the best thing that ever happened to women 's basketball			1
true , when the @entity7 play , the outcome of every game is known in advance , much as the outcome of every @entity90 case was known in advance			0
the fun lay in seeing how the inevitable victory happened -- in watching the genius at work			0
people knew going in that @entity97 always escaped			0
they still watched , because the next time he might not			0
and so it goes for the @entity7 , who trailed 20 - 12 after a hideous first half tuesday night before slipping the padlocks and swimming to the surface , triumphant			0
people who play and appreciate extraordinary basketball recognize this dominance as an end unto itself			0
" @entity6 has too many weapons , " @entity109 star @entity108 said on @entity110 last week			2
" best team ever in sports ? " not many people can answer that question knowledgeably , because most people do n't watch women 's basketball			1
it ca n't help that the women 's final is played between the men 's national championship game and the @entity124 golf tournament			1
it 's a subordinate clause between a giant pair of parentheses			0
pity , because the 2009 - 10 @entity6 women are surely one of sports history 's most dominant teams , one for whom losing is unfathomable			1
" what if the @entity6 women lose ? " @entity135 guard @entity134 asked on @entity110 during the tournament			1
" i hope not , because that means the end of the world is near			0
" he pleaded for the @entity7 to save the planet -- or as @entity134 put it : " @entity142			0
" of course , the @entity7 are not saving mankind			0
women 's teams , unlike men 's , are somehow required to carry the flag for their entire gender			1
they 're " empowering our daughters , " they 're sneaker - shod suffragettes			0
the @entity153 men 's team that won 88 consecutive games in the early 1970s were n't striking a blow for wearers of headbands or mutton - chop sideburns			1
the @entity160 dynasty of the ' 90s was not empowering the rainbow - haired			0
men 's teams play and are appreciated on their own merits			1
we should be able to do the same with the @entity6 women			1
they do n't have to be heroines or feminist icons			0
the epithet my wife most often uses to describe herself is " tall chick			0
" that 's what the @entity6 women are : women -- some tall , some not -- playing very good basketball			1
it 's pleasure enough to watch a bunch of shiny new parts working together , efficiently , toward a devastating end : the kind of beauty you see in a combine harvester as it threshes a field of wheat			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity191 says @entity6 had to defend title , winning streak and dominance in sport
@entity6 *thwarts* critics ' complaints the team is just too good , @entity191 says
women 's teams , unlike men 's , are required to carry flag for their entire gender , he says
@entity191 : the @entity6 women are one of sports history 's most dominant teams
