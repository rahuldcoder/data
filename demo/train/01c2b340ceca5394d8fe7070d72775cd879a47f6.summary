@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 and @entity4 remained at odds over the alliance 's plans for a missile defense system in @entity9 after a foreign ministers meeting in @entity1 thursday			1
@entity3 secretary general @entity11 said " differences remain " over the plans , but he rejected @entity4 's complaints that @entity3 was ignoring @entity16 's concerns the missile defense system could be used against it			1
" we listen and we have listened today , " @entity11 said after a meeting of @entity3 's 28 foreign ministers with @entity20 foreign minister @entity19			1
" we take @entity20 concerns seriously			0
" @entity11 's tone was softer than his comments wednesday , when he said @entity4 's threats to withdraw from the @entity26 treaty and deploy ballistic missiles on its southern border to counter the missile shield were reminiscent of a confrontation of a bygone era and reflect a " fundamental misunderstanding of the @entity34 's intentions			1
" " we do not consider @entity4 an enemy , " he said thursday after the meeting			2
" we consider @entity4 a partner			0
" @entity19 said after the talks that @entity3 was unwilling to compromise " unfortunately our partners are not yet ready for cooperation on missile defense , " he said , adding the @entity16 needed " clear guarantees " the missile defense system would not target its own nuclear deterrent			1
" we stand ready for dialogue provided that legitimate concerns of all parties are taken into consideration , " @entity19 said			0
" we can find a mutually beneficial solution , we still have some time but time is running out every day			0
" the @entity54 administration and its @entity9 allies have tried to ease @entity4 's fears over the project by insisting that the system is directed toward countering the missile threat from the @entity60 from which @entity4 also needs protection			1
@entity63 secretary of state @entity62 attempted to make that argument again following the meeting			0
" we will continue to press forward on missile defense ; we 'll be transparent			1
we have explained that our system can not and will not threaten @entity4 , does not affect our strategic balance with @entity4 , " she told reporters			2
" no other country will be given a veto over what threats we perceive are most salient			0
ballistic missiles against the territory we are pledged to protect are not coming from @entity4 in our assessment but from other locations			0
it 's not directed at @entity20 , not about @entity4 ; it 's @entity78 and others who are threatening to develop missile technology			1
" since @entity3 approved the @entity63 - designed system at last year 's summit in @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 have agreed to deploy parts of it			1
@entity3 asked @entity4 to participate in the system but negotiations have been deadlocked over @entity4 's demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to @entity16 's own systems			1
@entity11 said he hoped a political agreement with @entity16 could be reached before a summit between @entity3 and @entity4 in @entity99 next may			2
that is when @entity3 is expected to declare an interim operational capability of the system			2
last month , @entity20 president @entity103 threatened to withdraw from the @entity26 treaty on nuclear weapons reductions and deploy ballistic missiles in its exclave of @entity109 on its border with @entity9 if @entity3 moved ahead with the plans for missile defense			1
tensions increased last week when @entity114 , @entity4 's ambassador to @entity3 , suggested @entity16 would close transit routes that send vital supplies to troops in @entity118			1
more than half the supplies for @entity3 forces in @entity118 now arrive from @entity118 's northern border with @entity4 and @entity122			1
the so - called @entity123 has become even more important to the war effort in @entity118 now that @entity125 has shut down its border crossings into @entity118 following a @entity63 air attack killed two dozen @entity125 soldiers late last month			0
@entity63 officials have said that @entity114 has indicated that his remarks were taken " out of context , " but he has yet to clarify his remarks			0
@entity11 said such threats to close the supply routes were an " empty threat " because stabilizing @entity4 was " clearly in @entity4 's self interests			2
" @entity16 " knows from bitter experience that instability in @entity118 has negative repercussions in @entity4 as well , " he said , referring to the @entity138 occupation of the country in the 1990s			0
tensions remained high with @entity4 over comments by @entity62 this week voicing " serious concerns " about recent @entity4 's parliamentary elections and calling for an investigation into allegations of fraud and vote - rigging			2
@entity4 's @entity151 described @entity153 's comments as " unacceptable " and @entity103 said @entity4 's political system was " none of their business			1
" @entity3 ministers also discussed @entity118 and plans to gradually transfer security control to @entity118 forces before foreign combat troops plan to withdraw by the end of 2014 , as well as tensions with @entity125 over last month 's attack			0
the @entity63 has expressed condolences for the attack and is leading an investigation into the incident			0
@entity11 on wednesday expressed regret for the attack and called for renewed cooperation between @entity3 and @entity125 in @entity118			0
" i fully agree that at the end of the day we need a positive engagement of @entity125 if we are to ensure long - term peace and stability in @entity118 , " he said			0
the @entity3 meeting follows monday 's conference in @entity178 , @entity179 , where some 100 nations and international organizations pledged to keep supporting @entity118 beyond the 2014 withdrawal .			2

new : @entity153 says " it 's @entity78 and others who are threatening to develop missile technology "
" we believe our defenses would be more *effective* if we cooperate , " @entity3 chief says

@entity3 has asked @entity4 to participate in the system , but negotiations have been at an impasse
