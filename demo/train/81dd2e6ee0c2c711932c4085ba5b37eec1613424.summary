-- when it comes to seeking public redemption for crimes and misdemeanors , such as cheating in the @entity5 , surely being interviewed by @entity6 is , well , cheating			1
even @entity7 admits he is unlikely to win absolution simply by subjecting himself to a trial by talk show			1
the road to redemption should be a grueling uphill struggle , and one undertaken without massive quantities of drugs			1
many will try to climb it			2
many will fall by the wayside			2
here are a 10 alternative steps to salvation @entity7 may , or may not , like to consider : 1			1
@entity22 before she too became an alumnus of the @entity6 sofa , @entity24 sprinter @entity23 denied doping her way to @entity29 glory in the @entity30			1
the truth eventually overtook her			2
after serving jail time , @entity23 began a new career as a basketball player and was signed in 2010 to @entity35 , a women 's team whose ill - starred fortunes she failed to improve before she was let go a year later			1
@entity7 's chance : @entity7 's drive and aggression would make him a natural salesman			1
do something better blurting out anti-semitic nonsense was a drunken @entity47 's ticket to purgatory in 2006			1
his career - topping action movie " @entity50 , " released a few months later , was his ticket home			2
unfortunately , @entity47 kind of blew it again in 2010 when he became embroiled in allegations of domestic abuse			2
despite what @entity56 says , he remains cast out into the wilderness			2
@entity7 's chance : riding to a drug - free victory in the @entity61 might help			1
but to fully better his former glory he will need to win every @entity5 until 2020			1
do a runner director @entity64 has spent 35 years on the lam from charges of unlawful sex with a minor at no apparent cost to his reputation as film maker			2
@entity64 fled the @entity24 before being sentenced in 1977 , seeking refuge in @entity73			2
from there he has continued a successful career that peaked in 2002 with the @entity77 - winning " the @entity76			0
" @entity7 's chance : @entity73 wo n't take @entity7 given the damage he has done to the @entity5			1
but as @entity81 has shown , @entity80 might			0
do a stint in rehab @entity84 said rehab did n't work because he cured himself			0
and we believe everything he says , right ? but whatever the merits of checking into a clinic are , for $ 4,000 - a - night , your reputation gets a lot of help			0
supermodel @entity94 lost fashion contracts after she was photographed allegedly snorting drugs			2
after one month in rehab , the checkbooks were back out and she was flouncing down catwalks with renewed credibility			0
@entity7 's chance : what are you waiting for @entity7 ? four weeks away from the bad headlines and a chance to rule the exercise bikes in the clinic gym			1
7 lessons @entity7 's confession has taught us 5			1
do a hugh " i did something dishonourable , shabby and goatish , " said movie star @entity112 in 1995 shortly after he was caught in a shabby , dishonorable and , if he says so , goatish liaison with a prostitute			0
rather than lie or shy away from the truth , @entity112 simply admitted everything and apologized in the affable manner that has continued to earn him millions of @entity120 dollars			0
@entity112 could probably get away with punching president @entity121 by looking slightly sheepish afterwards and mumbling something in a charming @entity124 accent			0
@entity7 's chance : " gosh , sorry everyone , i 've been a bit foolish , " says @entity7 , pushing back his newly - cultivated floppy fringe			1
do a book conveniently , @entity7 has already done a book			1
" it 's @entity136 , " chronicled his victory over testicular cancer and his fight back into world class cycling			2
it would n't take much effort to tack on a couple of extra chapters and perhaps edit in a few furtive meetings with seedy doctors that he might have accidentally missed out the first time round			0
the book route certainly worked for drug cheat @entity146 who fessed all in his 2011 autobiography " @entity152 , " and battled his way back last year to win a @entity5 stage to deserved acclaim			1
@entity7 's chance : surely no one will complain if @entity7 cheats and uses a ghost writer			1
do a @entity156 when all else fails , do all of the above			0
this , so far , seems to have worked out ok for @entity156 the once - troubled actor spent time in and out of rehab and jail			0
he tried something new by releasing a record			0
he reportedly almost wrote a book about his problems , but later pulled out of the deal			0
he has n't apologized in @entity170 style , but he did appear on " @entity171 , " which shows a degree of contrition			0
and since cleaning up his act , he 's gone on to deliver some of his best work			2
oh , and he 's also done an @entity6 interview			1
@entity7 's chance : seven stolen @entity5 victories			1
do a @entity181 or , as it is also known : a @entity183			0
it looked like the career of the 42nd president of the @entity24 was over after details of his improper relationship with intern @entity190 hit the headlines in 1998			0
miraculously , he survived impeachment and managed to ride out the rest of his term			0
@entity183 's salvation appears to have been that the furore became less focused on what he 'd done and more on what he 'd said -- a complex exercise in semantics that at one point got hung up on the definition of the word " is			2
" eventually everyone got so baffled , they more or less gave up			0
@entity7 's chance : he 's already started with the semantics , saying he did n't consider he was cheating at the time			1
do nothing can @entity7 learn anything from disgraced former @entity24 congressman @entity212 ? accidentally posting a photo of your own crotch on @entity216 , as @entity212 did , is a far cry from being accused of using performance - enhancing drugs to win major sports titles ; one misdemeanor was clearly a lot bigger than the other			1
but size is n't everything , so perhaps @entity212 , who subsequently lapsed into an 18 - month silence , can offer inspiration			0
apparently absolved , @entity212 has now made a tentative return to @entity216 and there is now talk of him running again to become @entity230 mayor			0
@entity7 's chance : there 's never been a better reason to keep your cycling shorts firmly on			1
and your @entity216 account off			0
social media reaction to @entity7 admission 10			1
@entity237 @entity238 is never the best person to drag into an argument about redemption , but his case does offer lessons			0
former footballer @entity238 , as you may or may not remember , was acquitted of murdering his ex-wife and her friend in 1994			0
in a separate trial , which you also may or may not recall , he was held liable for their wrongful deaths and ordered to pay millions in damages			0
then in 2007 , as you can be forgiven for being somewhat vague about , @entity238 was jailed for 33 years for armed robbery and kidnapping			2
the upshot of all this is not many people , clearly excluding those involved , can precisely recall what @entity238 has or has n't been found guilty of and what he is now being punished for			0
not exactly redemption , but certainly a wall of confusion to hide behind			0
@entity7 's chance : on second thoughts , perhaps just stick to @entity6			1
read what @entity0 readers think about @entity7 's @entity6 interview			1

in an interview with @entity6 , cyclist @entity7 admits doping
the disgraced *athlete* 's admission follows 7 @entity5 wins
@entity7 had for many years denied using performance enhancing drugs
@entity279 looks at ways @entity7 could try to repair his public image
