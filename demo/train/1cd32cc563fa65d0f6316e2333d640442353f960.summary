@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 is a ghost town these days			1
only a few people can be seen scavenging through the rubble hoping to find anything worth salvaging from the carcasses of residential buildings in this war - ravaged city in western @entity1			1
but there is n't very much to salvage after a major government offensive ousted rebels from the city , which is strategically located near the border with @entity16 and very close to the main highway connecting @entity18 to @entity1 's coast and to northern cities like @entity21			1
" of course we want to come back here , " an elderly man told me			0
" we are hoping for government support to make this @entity0 worth living in again			0
" the man 's name is @entity29			1
he said his family have just returned after fleeing to the city of @entity32 when rebels took over the town more than a year ago			2
@entity29 was cleaning up his house and led me through ransacked rooms			2
" they stole everything , " he said			0
he means the anti-government forces , whom the @entity41 government labels as terrorists but are supported by many @entity45 and @entity46 countries			2
@entity29 then showed me a hole in the roof			2
" that was his only word as we looked up at the sun that now shone in through the gap in his ceiling			0
the opposition took over control of @entity0 in february 2012			0
the town became an important supply hub for weapons for rebel fighters in central @entity1 because of its proximity to the @entity64 border			1
it is also important for the government because it is located near a vital supply line for the @entity1 military fighting in @entity70 , @entity21 and other places in the region			1
after a long siege of the city by @entity77 forces , @entity1 's military enlisted the help of @entity79 , the radical @entity80 militia from @entity16			1
@entity41 's army and @entity79 forces launched an offensive in early june of this year and re-took @entity0 on june 5			1
but the cost of re-taking the city was clearly immense			0
driving through town we could not find a single building left unscathed			0
in the central square , the iconic clock tower was destroyed			0
an ancient mosque had also suffered several direct hits with a gaping hole left in the minaret			0
and the city 's only church had substantial damage both inside and out with some of the icons defaced			1
@entity1 military personnel on the ground claim @entity102 rebels are to blame			1
a senior commander later showed us on a map how the army moved into @entity0			0
" first we surrounded the city and then we attacked it from all sides			0
and of course we killed a lot of them and there were a lot of wounded , " he recalled			0
" the rest of them ran away through the valleys and the mountains , mostly to @entity16			2
and now we can announce that @entity0 and its suburbs are totally cleansed of @entity80 fighters			2
" the town might be " cleansed , " as the officer put it , but in many places in and around @entity0 , the earth is literally scorched			0
most of those now returning to the town are @entity129 , highlighting the increasingly sectarian nature of the conflict in @entity1			1
@entity29 is a @entity129 as well			1
he says his son was kidnapped by @entity80 fighters and he clearly blames some of his @entity134 neighbors for collaborating with the opposition			2
" we have been living with the @entity140 for generations , " his wife said as we stood in their ruined apartment			0
" i do n't know why they did this , why they helped them			0
" @entity29 also took us to his brother 's house , which was almost razed to the ground			1
many of the rooms were burned from the inside			0
@entity29 said his brother fled when one of his sons was killed by rebel fighters			2
" my brother is an engineer			0
his son came to the door and they shot him because they think all @entity129 are against them , " @entity29 tells me			1
both @entity29 and his wife say they could forgive their neighbors but it is hard to see how this community , which before the crisis was majority @entity134 with a substantial @entity129 minority , could ever go back to what it used to be , even if more people return			1
the opposition has called the @entity1 military 's offensive a massacre and called for the international community to intervene			1
meanwhile the @entity41 government blames the rebels for the carnage in @entity0 and says it intervened because of pleas from the population			0
no matter who is at fault , @entity0 is completely destroyed -- a once peaceful community on the @entity1 - @entity16 border that might never be restored again .			1

*pro-assad* forces re-took city on @entity16 border from the rebels
strategically located along main highway connecting @entity18 to @entity1 's coast
@entity29 , a @entity129 , was caught up in what is becoming a sectarian conflict
he says much of the damage in the city was caused by @entity80 rebels
