, but where do all of those dead airplanes go ? the numbers are huge : approximately 12,000 aircraft are set to be decommissioned by 2020			1
in addition , 2,000 - 3,000 planes are estimated to have been abandoned around the world ( primarily in developing countries ) according to the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
as their aircraft near the end of their service lives , aircraft owners must find ways for dealing with retirees			2
for aircraft at that awkward stage when they 're no longer safe to fly but still too sturdy to demolish , there are storage facilities like that at @entity25 in @entity26 or the @entity27 and @entity28 in @entity29			2
the problem is , they 're only temporary			2
while some parts -- especially engine parts -- practically sell themselves and find new homes on new planes , other airplane parts can get more innovative second lives , such as the ones featured below			1
furniture futuristic rivets , elegant curves , gleaming surfaces and the ability to withstand extremes ... it 's easy to see why furniture designers would be intrigued by the potential of decommissioned airplanes			1
the widely acknowledged leader in this niche industry is @entity51 , a @entity29 - based company that 's been designing sleek , sexy beds , tables , chairs and sculptures constructed from deconstructed airplanes for more than a decade			1
" we have over 100 designs and have produced thousands of pieces that you find nearly in all parts of the world , from the @entity65 , to the @entity66 , and even as far away as the @entity67 , " says managing partner @entity57			2
@entity69 's bordbar , the first company that thought to revamp airline trolleys as multifunctional and decorative furniture , customizes trolleys			1
this can mean incorporating butterfly patterns or corporate logos , transforming the trolley into a filing cabinet or mini-bar , complete with shelves , glass front and led lighting			2
" we sell our products around the globe , with approximately 220 wholesalers , " says bordbar co-founder @entity83			2
" there is definitely a market for trolleys			1
" bordbar trolleys start at € 979 ( $ 1,300 )			1
@entity69 company @entity91 also specializes in glammed - up airline trolleys , selling luxurious , attention - grabbing designs like the @entity95 trolley , decorated with 24 - carat gold leaf			1
the company 's star product , the @entity100 trolley , is covered in 82,000 @entity102 crystals			2
@entity91 's trolleys start at € 1,380 ( $ 1,833 ) , but luxury trolleys go for anywhere from € 3,900 ( $ 5,180 ) to € 27,800 ( $ 37,000 )			1
floor and wall tile aircraft aluminum is n't like the aluminum most of us know			2
because of the alloys that make it sturdy and fit for flight , it 's also difficult to recycle			0
@entity115 , a building material from @entity118 - based @entity117 , is made from completely recycled aircraft aluminum			1
" the energy used in recycling aluminum is 5 % of what would be used during the first generation of aluminum production , " says @entity120 , business development director for @entity121 the best part is that @entity115 is itself recyclable			0
" so if you ever desire to change your decor , @entity115 can be removed and used over again , " says @entity128			0
" it is truly a cradle - to - cradle product			1
" boat @entity134 , or " flying boats , " are rare ( the @entity136 developed a fleet during @entity138 ) , but a former 1939 @entity139 converted into a boat that can reach up to 13 knots occupies a remarkable place in recycled plane lore			1
the boat has an unforgettable name -- the @entity146 -- as well as an equally interesting history			1
it belonged to aviation pioneer @entity149 in the 1940s			0
after it was re-christened by pilot @entity154 , its current owner , @entity152 , purchased it in 1981 to live aboard			0
" the original aircraft controls in the cockpit are now used to drive the boat with both the pilot and co-pilot controls , " says @entity152			1
" this is what makes the planeboat so unique and novel ; you sit where @entity149 used to fly the plane to drive the boat			1
" @entity169 ? intensely curious ? the @entity146 muffin is open for tours and charters out of @entity173 , @entity174			1
@entity175 architect @entity177 's design , the @entity175 , a @entity179 mansion constructed from an entire @entity180 , manages to be striking and graceful , even without the knowledge that it was built on ecologically sound principles			0
via his website , @entity184 compares the process of converting the 747 into a house to the way " the @entity189 used every part of the buffalo			0
" the most obviously aerial feature is the curvilinear roof , constructed from the wings of the former plane			1
working with a smaller budget , but no less entrepreneurial , @entity199 resident @entity198 's @entity197 is a structurally untouched @entity200 - 200 that 's been gutted on the inside			1
then there is @entity204 's " @entity203 , " involving two airplanes , an @entity206 and a @entity207 , that have been converted into a home			1
hotel it 's difficult to imagine a traveler disembarking from an airplane wanting to spend a night in one			1
but if the number of hotels built into airplanes is any indication , such travelers do exist			1
@entity218 , a luxurious hotel located in a @entity220 rainforest , is a recycled @entity200			0
despite its clipped wings , from the exterior it looks like an aircraft emerging from the jungle ready to fly out over the @entity226			0
the fuselage that encases the two bedrooms of the " @entity230 " suite is intact			0
apart from the distinctive shape of the portholes and curved ceiling , however , the interior feels more woodsy bungalow than aircraft			0
meanwhile , @entity238 's @entity237 has budget accommodation @entity239 , a hostel built into a @entity180 747 , popularly known as a @entity180			0
" i financed and built the whole hostel , " says owner @entity242			0
" we wanted to be unique , but not discriminating toward anyone with a smaller budget			0
" this welcoming attitude may be why the cockpit has served as the setting of several weddings , and why former 747 pilots are regular visitors			0
" @entity239 is a place for everyone , " says @entity242			0
for € 350 ( $ 465 ) a night , there 's the @entity256 for two in the @entity257			0
built inside a decommissioned @entity259 , it comes with amenities you could n't have on a private jet -- @entity263 , sauna , flat - screen tvs and basic kitchen equipment , not to mention a mini-bar and @entity269 collection			1
artificial reef most airplanes try to avoid submersion in large bodies of water			2
that sort of thing is usually called an " accident			0
" but if the airplane is empty , then sinking it into the sea to create an artificial reef , like the @entity282 ( @entity282 ) did with a @entity284 , it might actually be a good thing , as they become homes for , and thus promote , local marine life			1
" the ' passenger list ' of creatures that now inhabit the reef has grown to over 100 species , " says @entity288 , director of public relations at the @entity282			0
anything else recycling an airplane means recycling the interior as well			2
@entity299 retailer @entity298 stocks laptop messenger bags fitted with former airplane seatbelts as straps -- a good gift for university freshmen who need to lug around textbooks			2
then there 's @entity308 retailer @entity307 , with its @entity310 line			0
though often out of stock ( recycling depends on the availability of discarded materials ) , the company stocks a line of bags , clothes and accessories made from recycled @entity321 interiors			0
@entity324 architectural firm @entity322 has ambitious concept designs for a library of more than 200 stacked @entity180 fuselages ; @entity328 presents the idea of converting fuselages into futuristic supertrains that would run on tracks suspended several stories above the ground			0
sure , these innovations do n't actually exist			0
but people laughed at airplanes , too , until they really took off			2
