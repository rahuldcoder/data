-- around 200 new species of frogs have been found in @entity3 , one of the world 's biodiversity hotspots			1
a study has found nearly 200 new species of frogs in @entity3			1
a study identified between 129 and 221 new species of frogs on the island			2
the @entity14 @entity13 ( @entity15 ) , who carried out the study , believe the find could practically double the number of amphibians known in the world if the results are extrapolated at a global scale			0
the study , published in the journal " @entity25 , " suggests that the number of amphibian species in @entity3 has been significantly underestimated			1
" the diversity of species in @entity3 is far from being known and there is still a lot of scientific research to be done			2
our data suggest that the number of new species of amphibians not only has been underestimated but it is spatially widespread , even in well studied areas , " said professor @entity33 , @entity15 researcher to the press at the @entity35 in @entity36			0
" for example , two of the most visited and studied national parks , @entity44 and @entity47 / @entity46 , harbor 31 and 10 new species respectively			0
" dr. @entity50 , curator of herpetology at the @entity52 from @entity53 was part of the research team : " during the past 15 years , we discovered and described over 100 new frog species from @entity3 , which led us to believe that our species inventory is almost complete			0
but as our new surveys show , there are many more species than we suspected , " he said in a press statement			0
the paper suggests that the total biodiversity on the island could be much higher in other species as well , so the actual destruction of natural habitats may be affecting more animals than previously thought			0
this has important consequences for conservation planning , as the rate of destruction of rainforests in @entity3 has been one of the highest in the planet , with more than 80 percent of the historic surface of rainforest already lost , according to the study 's authors			1
almost a quarter of the new species discovered have not been found yet in protected areas , but the unstable political situation in @entity3 has also been cited as hampering conservation efforts			1
" although a lot of reserves and national parks have been created in @entity3 during the last decade , the actual situation of politic instability is allowing the cut of the forest within national parks , generating a lot of uncertainty about the future of the planned network of protected areas " , said @entity33			2
@entity3 is the fourth largest island in the world and one of the most biodiverse areas globally , with a high degree of endemic species			1
" to get an idea of its biodiversity -- while in the @entity106 [ there ] are about 30 species of amphibians and in @entity109 about 20 , in a single locality in @entity3 we can find around 100 species of frogs , " said @entity33			1
dr. @entity114 , professor at the @entity116 , @entity109 , who was also part of the study team , and believes that a century of new species discovery is just beginning : " people think that we know which plant and animal species live on this planet			0
but the majority of life forms on @entity127 is still awaiting scientific recognition			0

nearly 200 new species of amphibians found on biodiversity hotspot of @entity3
study found many outside of the island 's conservation areas
political instability in the country makes conservation efforts extra *difficult*
