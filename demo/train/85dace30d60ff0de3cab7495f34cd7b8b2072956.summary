-- life 's a beach for some of @entity5 's best horses			1
trainer @entity6 says a day at @entity8 's @entity7 provides the perfect workout for his thoroughbreds before they tough it out on the turf			1
" this is the ultimate exercise , for both their mind and body , " @entity6 told @entity0 's @entity14 show			1
" you take them down to the beach and for the first few strides they do their normal routine , which is either to be difficult or pull , and next thing you just watch them take a breath and they just totally relax			2
" they certainly get hypnotized by the motion of the water , because you actually find you feel they start leaning as the water starts either going forward or back			0
all of a sudden you have this horse that is just so relaxed and at the same time , he 's getting the advantages of this lovely clear fresh seawater			2
" the formula clearly works			0
since starting his career 14 years ago , @entity6 has followed in the footsteps of his father @entity41 and become one of the country 's most successful trainers			1
last year , he trained 198 winners , smashing the previous @entity5 annual record of 174			1
the tally included an unprecedented seven winners in a day at @entity49 in @entity50			0
with 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) of white sand stretching along @entity8 's @entity54 peninsula , @entity51 is popular with surfers and the odd shark as well as its equine visitors			1
it 's all part of a routine that helps the horses arrive at the track relaxed , ready to race and able to " dig that little bit deeper , " @entity6 says			1
he has 38 runners lining up in 12 races at the @entity66 at @entity8 's famous @entity67 this saturday , with @entity68 his contender in the main race			2
the six - year - old picked up a minor leg injury at an exhibition gallop recently , but a bit of ocean therapy has helped speed up his recovery			0
" when horses pick up certain injuries , or even mentally need a break , the ocean is by far the most superior thing i 've ever seen , and it just gives them that day to just get their heads together , or get a little bit of infection out of their leg , " @entity6 says			1
" one walk in the ocean and you 've got a healed horse			0
" it 's all about giving the horses what they need , the 39 - year - old says , whether it 's splashing around in the waves or pottering around in paddocks with their mates			2
" a happy horse is a good horse , " he says			0
" i only ask for one thing in return , that when those pens open and the starting gates open and those horses get running , that they give of their best , and as it stands now we seem to have a great agreement			0
