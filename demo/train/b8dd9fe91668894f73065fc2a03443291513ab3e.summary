" we do not believe any money was moved out of the @entity3			2
" @entity50 , the general counsel and legislative director for the @entity52 , said monday that most of the shifted funds helped make up a shortfall between rising salaries for weather forecasters and the amount of money appropriated to pay them			2
weakened storm soaks @entity62 @entity61 sen. @entity63 , @entity64 , called friday for @entity9 to look into the matter			1
according to a statement by @entity63 , senior staff at the @entity3 " have been conducting improper and potentially illegal transfers of taxpayers ' money			1
" " while the director of the @entity3 has stepped down , there are many more remaining questions which require answers from both @entity32 and the @entity75 -- and any and all individuals who bear responsibility in this misconduct must be held fully to account , " her statement said			0
in addition , the senator expressed concern that " the investigative report raises fundamental concerns that the core operations of the @entity3 are underfunded " and the @entity75 lacks sufficient overview			0

" in a memorandum to staff last week , @entity17 said @entity32 will ask @entity9 to reprogram $ 35 million in funding to address the situation			0

in a separate issue , an audit of nine @entity32 contracts released last week found they lacked sufficient supporting information or were too subjective in granting performance awards , providing " little incentive for contractors to excel			0
