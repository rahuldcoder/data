her requests for parole and a prison transfer recently denied , a member of the punk rock collective @entity6 was hospitalized amid a hunger strike friday , according to @entity9 state - run media			1
doctors ordered that @entity11 be placed in the medical ward of a penal colony in @entity14 , southeast of @entity15 , where she is serving a two - year sentence , reported @entity17 , citing the @entity9 penitentiary service			1
her hospitalization came just hours after her request to be transferred to another prison was denied , her lawyer , @entity20 , told the media outlet			2
@entity11 , 23 , announced she was launching a hunger strike earlier this week			2
her only sustenance for the last five days has been water , according to @entity17			0
in a lengthy letter to the news site @entity29 ( a translated version was published in @entity32 's @entity31 ) , @entity11 described " slave labor " and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties			1
@entity11 wrote that her life was once threatened and other prisoners tell her she is not beaten only because of the celebrity her case has brought her			1
" it 's true : others are beaten up			0
for not being able to keep up			0
they hit them in the kidneys , in the face			0
prisoners themselves deliver these beatings , and not a single one of them is done without the approval and full knowledge of the administration , " she wrote			0
" @entity58 prisoners are afraid of their own shadows			0
" prison authorities told @entity17 that @entity11 was blackmailing them for denying her request for special treatment , but her husband told @entity9 media this week that a guard had refused to give her water and grabbed her by the arms , refusing to let go			1
those claims , too , were denied , as a penitentiary spokesman told @entity70 that doctors recommended only that she be given warm water and no physical force had been used against her			2
@entity11 and two other band members were imprisoned last year for " hooliganism " after @entity6 performed a " punk prayer " critical of then - prime minister , now president , @entity77 at a @entity79 cathedral			1
video of the performance went viral			0
while @entity11 and bandmate @entity84 remain in prison , a third @entity6 member , @entity86 , was released in october 2012 after her defense presented new evidence in her case			1
in july , @entity14 's @entity90 upheld a decision to deny @entity11 parole , and last month lawyers for @entity11 and @entity84 requested that the court allow the pair to do community service in lieu of completing their sentences			2
@entity11 is scheduled to be released in march			2
it 's unclear if she will end her hunger strike as her letter to @entity29 this week states she wo n't relent until prison conditions change			0
" i am going on hunger strike and refusing to participate in colony slave labor , " she wrote			1
" i will do this until the administration starts obeying the law and stops treating incarcerated women like cattle ejected from the realm of justice for the purpose of stoking the production of the sewing industry ; until they start treating us like humans			0
