-- @entity1 flickered in war - torn @entity2 on tuesday as national security forces formally took over security leadership and peace talks with the @entity7 are now in the works			1
@entity10 - led troops transferred security responsibility to @entity2 forces			1
the @entity13 and an @entity2 government group dedicated to peace and reconciliation will hold talks with the @entity7 militant group in @entity19			1
" i wish a long - term peace in @entity2 , " @entity2 president @entity20 told his troops at a handover ceremony in @entity23			1
but a senior @entity13 official said reconciliation is likely to be " long , complex and messy " because trust between @entity2 and the @entity7 is extremely low			1
the latest moves could portend a hopeful chapter in the long and costly @entity2 conflict			1
what do these developments mean for @entity2 and the @entity13 ? here are some key questions that will be asked in the coming months : 1			1
are the @entity2 troops up to the task ? there are certainly doubts			1
a @entity39 review in december found that only one of 23 @entity2 army brigades was capable of functioning on its own			1
meanwhile , literacy rates are low , desertion rates are high , and many deserters have joined the insurgency			0
there also have been a troubling number of " green - on - blue " attacks : @entity2 troops attacking their @entity13 comrades			1
but then - defense secretary @entity52 spoke positively about the progress @entity2 had made in growing their army , reducing violence and becoming more self - sufficient			1
at the time , @entity2 forces were leading nearly 90 % of operations across the country			1
" we 're on the right path to give ( @entity2 ) the opportunity to govern itself , " @entity52 said			2
@entity20 has said he welcomes the @entity13 troop withdrawal and insists his army can defend the country against the @entity7			2
" it is exactly our job to deal with it , and we are capable of dealing with it , " @entity20 said during an interview with @entity0 's @entity66			2
what are the conditions for peace ? @entity20 seems eager to resume stalled peace talks with the @entity7 and include them in the political process			2
the @entity75 of @entity2 -- a government group devoted to reconciliation and peace -- will go to @entity19 and participate in talks with the @entity7 , @entity20 said tuesday			1
the @entity13 will have a first formal meeting soon in @entity81 , @entity19 , after the @entity2 and @entity7 huddle , senior administration officials said			2
the meetings coincide with the @entity7 opening an office in the @entity86 nation of @entity19			0
for their part , the @entity7 told reporters in @entity81 on tuesday that they want to improve relations with the world			0
they are calling themselves the " @entity91 of @entity2			2
" the @entity7 back " supporting a political process and a peaceful resolution that will bring an end to the occupation in @entity2 and establishing an @entity99 and independent government in it " and forging " true security , " a representative said			1
at the same time , the @entity7 representative advocated the idea of political resistance			0
the @entity13 and @entity2 have several conditions the @entity7 ultimately need to meet for a peace deal -- breaking ties with @entity109 , ending violence and accepting the @entity2 @entity111 , including sections on women 's rights , senior administration officials told reporters tuesday			1
conditions also were outlined by the @entity75 , with one senior official saying there was no place for violence while talks are ongoing			1
" we are hoping the ( number of ) @entity7 attacks go down or even stop after we start talks , " the official said			2
the first meeting between the @entity13 and @entity7 is expected to be an exchange of agendas and what each side wants to talk about , followed by another meeting in a week or two			0
one of the administration officials said foremost on the @entity13 mind is hearing how the @entity7 are going to cut ties with @entity109 and urging them to talk seriously with the @entity2 government			2
exchange of detainees are expected to be on the agenda -- including @entity138 -- the @entity13 soldier believed to be in militant captivity			0
" peace is not at hand , " another senior official cautioned , adding there is " no guarantee this will happen quickly if at all			0
how big a threat do the @entity7 still pose ? the @entity7 are still " resilient and determined , " according to a recent @entity39 report , and pose a major security threat			2
the @entity7 continue to carry out high - profile attacks in the capital , @entity23 , even targeting the @entity152 during a suicide attack in june			2
another strike targeted a building near @entity23 airport			0
on tuesday , a suicide bomber attacked the convoy of haji @entity159 , a member of parliament , killing three people and wounding 21 others			0
three bodyguards were among the injured			0
@entity159 -- a @entity163 and an ethnic @entity164 -- is a member of @entity2 's political opposition			1
the @entity7 regime in @entity2 was sheltering @entity109 when the terror network launched attacks against the @entity13 on september 11 , 2001			2
the next month , the @entity13 cranked up military operations that led to the toppling of the @entity7 government			0
ever since , international forces have been fighting radical @entity99 militants in @entity2 and neighboring @entity175			1
what are the biggest challenges ? the main fear among @entity2 is that the country could revert to another civil war once the @entity13 withdraws its combat troops			1
" some people we 've spoken to sort of take it for granted that there 's going to be a civil war when the @entity13 leaves , " said @entity0 's @entity182 on a trip last year to @entity2			1
" it happened before when the @entity189 left ( in 1989 )			0
" above all , @entity20 said the @entity2 army needs the tools to battle the insurgents , namely more equipment and firepower			2
he came to the @entity39 in january with a wish list asking for more helicopters , drones and other hardware , according to a senior defense official			0
" we need an air force			0
we need air mobility , " @entity20 told @entity66			0
" we need proper mechanized forces			0
we need , you know , armored vehicles and tanks and all that			0
" retired army gen. @entity207 , once @entity13 's top commander in @entity2 , said the @entity2 people are " terrified because they think they have something to lose			1
" " there has been progress made , " he said			0
" but they 're afraid that if we completely abandon them in 2014 , as they perceive we did in 1989 , ( things ) would all go back			0
what support will the @entity13 and allies provide ? @entity13 forces , now at about 66,000 , are expected to dip to 32,000 by the end of the year and further throughout 2014			0
the plan is to withdraw all combat troops but keep a residual force in the country to help train @entity2 and carry out counterterrorism operations when needed			1
the size of that force is still being discussed			0
gen. @entity229 , the former commander of @entity13 troops in @entity2 , recommended between 6,000 and 15,000 troops			1
but that figure was lowered to a range between 2,500 and 9,000 , according to a defense official			0
the @entity13 and @entity10 have pledged to continue to support and train @entity2 forces in what @entity10 secretary - general @entity236 deems a " new relationship , " starting in 2015			1
acknowledging that there is still much to do in the interim 18 months , @entity236 said , " today , our shared goal is in sight			0
" @entity0 's @entity243 and @entity244 contributed to this report .			0
