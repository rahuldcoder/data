-- as temperatures plummet in the @entity2 , why not enjoy some of the great travel experiences that only a big chill can bring			1
we look at the world 's top seven winterland marvels , as chosen by @entity9 authors : 1			1
the northern lights of @entity11 it 's the middle of night , in the middle of nowhere			1
it 's so dark that you can hold your hand three inches from your face and not see it			1
the silence is so complete that the low thud of snow falling from a nearby tree makes you jump			2
your eyelashes are close to frozen and it 's a struggle to separate them when you blink			1
and yet you 'd happily sit there all night , for many nights to come , for the chance to see nature 's most mysterious sight : the northern lights			1
@entity9 : the world 's hottest cool places with little light pollution , optimum weather conditions ( very cold , with plenty of clear nights ) and its position directly beneath the prime - viewing zone of the auroral oval , @entity35 in @entity11 is one of the best places in the world to see the northern lights			1
the @entity47 tundra and boreal forest surrounding the town see over 300 nights of auroral activity each year			2
displays might last hours , or be gone in a minute			2
flashing neon pink , turquoise and green , the lights swirl across the sky in myriad imagined shapes ( is that a walrus , a witch , a whale ? ) before whipping back on themselves and disappearing			1
in the presence of such a spectacle , it 's easy to believe local @entity67 myth that the aurora borealis are signals from the afterlife , particularly if you hear the sky crackle and swoosh as some claim			1
what is in no doubt during those moments when the lights whirl above your head is that you 're part of the greatest show on earth			1
@entity84 @entity83 january in @entity83			1
the city 's residents , long used to the cold , don fur hats and heavy coats to stand in line			1
nowadays , they wait not for bread , but for art : frozen art. every winter , sculptors transform blocks of ice into elaborate models of people , animals and objects			1
it 's a tradition that dates back to 1740 , when an entire ice palace was constructed to celebrate the birthday of the @entity104			1
set against a backdrop of golden domes sparkling in the light of the low sun , the exhibit embodies the magic of @entity83 in winter			1
locals bypass the city 's bridges , slithering over the ice - covered rivers and canals to make their way across town			1
the @entity118 is frozen solid , except for one large hole in front of the @entity121			0
this is the plunge pool for the @entity123 , a group of swimmers who exhort the health benefits of a daily dip			0
when the cold finally seeps in , @entity127 warm up with a vodka , served in an ice glass , from the ice bar			1
" at least we can do something with all this ice other than slipping and falling on it ! " observes one happy patron			1
@entity138 's reindeer migration one of the world 's greatest migrations takes place each year just over a thousand miles north of @entity142			1
as snow thickens on every surface , lakes freeze over and the temperature drops below @entity148 , tens of thousands of reindeer make their way across northern @entity138			2
descending from summer pastures in the mountains to the west , the herds travel east to spend the long winter foraging in the forests			1
accompanying them on a journey that can take ten days or more are their seminomadic @entity159 owners			0
while herding methods may have modernized over the centuries ( snowmobiles -- and even helicopters -- have replaced snowshoes ) , reindeer husbandry is still a cornerstone of their culture			0
to fall in with the @entity159 and their herds is to be part of a heritage that stretches back millennia -- one of days dictated by the pace of the reindeers ' steady trot , and of nights sharing stories round the fire under a chill , star - filled sky			2
@entity9 : the @entity142 's favorite winter pubs 4			1
@entity185 's sunken bell @entity186 to @entity185 's @entity187 this winter and you 're likely to come across one of @entity191 's most bizarre sights -- an apparently amputated church spire poking out from the frozen waters of @entity194			1
the 14th - century bell tower , pointing like an arrow to the blustery skies above , is a forlorn monument to an entire village drowned beneath the waters of an artificial lake created as part of a hydroelectricity project in the 1950s			0
locals will tell you that the tolling of its church bell can still be heard on a cold night -- even though the bell was removed when the valley was flooded			0
tall tales may have sprung up around it , but the church and the lake are very much part of local life , particularly in winter			2
snow - kiters twirl across the ice , leaping high into the air as their kites catch a gust of wind , keeping an eye out for ice - skaters gliding around the lake 's perimeter			1
families slip and slide their way to the base of the tower , eager to slap their gloved hands on a piece of history that 's out of reach most of the year			2
@entity235 's boiling waters there are few places as beguiling as @entity238			2
it is a landscape created by grinding glaciers and volcanic eruptions , a place of fire and brimstone where the very earth breathes , belches and bubbles like a giant kettle on the boil			0
here , in a land roamed by moose , bears and wolves , geysers and hot springs seethe and simmer and finally blow , capturing the imagination as they have done since the park 's inception in 1872			2
it is @entity261 made wild and primeval			0
as the temperature drops and the snow piles high , the park takes on a special drama and grace			0
the tourist crowds thin , replaced by cross-country skiers silently swooshing along marked trails			0
@entity271 - coated bison pick their way through the deep snow to warm themselves in geyser basins , waiting for a waft of hot stream from shimmering thermal pools			0
they retreat a few paces as a hot spring suddenly erupts , sending an arc of boiling water high into the frigid air			0
@entity286 's ice festivals for much of the year , the sancheoneo -- a species of trout -- leads a blameless life in the rivers around @entity292 , a town that lies in the mountains northeast of @entity295			1
when the cold , dry @entity298 winter arrives , the rivers freeze over and the sancheoneo disappear under 40cm of ice			1
and then the trouble starts			0
every january , the @entity301 brings a sudden energy to this quiet corner of the country			0
hundreds of thousands of thickly clad visitors swarm over every frozen surface to try their hand at ice - fishing			2
barbecues come as naturally to @entity311 as baguettes to the @entity313 , and the smell of charcoal fires wafts along the banks , ready for the latest catch			0
for a few visitors , dropping a line through a hole in the ice to catch their fish is just not enough of an experience			2
dressed in t - shirts and shorts , they plunge into a pool of near freezing water and learn just what slippery customers trout can be			0
@entity332 ten o'clock on a monday morning in central @entity332			0
no buses steam down @entity334 , belching passengers at every stop			0
there are no crowds jostling for space on the pavements of @entity341 and the doors of its department stores remain locked			0
the tubes stand empty in their tunnels , planes are grounded at @entity348			0
the few people who 've made it into work in the @entity352 turn back when they find their offices closed			0
this is not the scene from an apocalyptic @entity357 - style film , but the reality of life in the capital on the rare occasion it lies under a thick blanket of snow			0
the streets empty and all activity migrates to the parks			0
on @entity369 , a running club has given up shuffling through the snow and is rolling a giant snowball down to the banks of the pond			0
in @entity374 , the resident deer paw at the frozen earth , looking for twigs and shrubs			0
far to the east in @entity380 , a borough 's worth of schoolchildren celebrate their unexpected day off by tobogganing down from the @entity385 , the distant skyscrapers of @entity387 barely visible through the grey murk			2
back in the center , snow falls steadily on a deserted @entity332 , bestowing on anyone who ventures onto its streets the unimaginable magic of having a city all to themselves			0
