-- there are dozens of ships , aircraft and helicopters searching for missing @entity5 in an area nearly as big as the continental @entity7			1
now , 4 - day - old satellite images have provided a much - needed lead : two objects spotted bobbing in the southern @entity11 , about 14 miles apart			2
the race is on to find those objects -- which experts caution could just as well be lost shipping containers as a chunk of fuselage or wing -- and by analyzing currents and other data perhaps locate the site where the plane might have gone down			1
let 's say they find it			1
would the mystery be solved ? hardly			1
finding the aircraft is just the beginning			1
assuming that the plane crashed and that it 's on the bottom of the ocean , search crews would face myriad obstacles in recovering parts of the plane and in piecing together what happened			1
and the treacherous waters of the southern @entity11 would only add to the challenge , said @entity39 , a senior fellow at the @entity40 and expert on @entity43 's radar systems			1
" the problem is that that piece of flotsam and jetsam is not where it was when the photograph was taken four days ago			2
the currents have taken it a long way eastwards , " he said			0
" so the aircraft are looking , in poor visibility , and this is the area that we used to call the ' @entity58 ' ; this is in the 19th century the kind of waters that ships got wrecked in			1
so this is really treacherous stretches of water , not easy to work in , very hard to detect things in			0
" the cases of @entity66 and @entity68 hint at the difficulties that might lie ahead			1
the first demonstrates how tedious reconstruction work is and how important that work is to explaining exactly what went wrong , while the second shows just how long an ocean recovery can take			1
" first thing to do is get back those recorders because ... there 's a huge amount of data in the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder			1
get those back , and then we can see what we need to do next			0
but , you know , time is of the essence , " said @entity85 , former director of the @entity87 's @entity86			1
he knows what he 's talking about			2
how do passenger jets change flight paths ? debunking conspiracy theories @entity85 investigated the july 1996 crash of @entity66 , which exploded in midair shortly after takeoff from @entity98 , killing all 230 people on board			1
his job began at the bottom of the @entity103			0
@entity104 and other divers spent more than 1,600 hours scouring for clues			2
" we found pieces from just forward of the center section of the wing			0
then we found the nose of the aircraft			2
and then we found the wings and the tail , the engines and everything else further down the flight path , " @entity85 said			0
the @entity87 ruled that the explosion was caused by an electrical short circuit , which detonated the fuel tank and caused the @entity121 to break into pieces in the waters off @entity124			0
the evidence was pieced together from a debris field of 75 square miles			2
thousands of fragments were pulled from a tangled web of wires and airplane skin			0
" we map the bottom			0
you get back seat cushions , victim remains , and what you do is x-ray everything , because you 're looking for an explosion			0
you 're looking for fast particles that may have been captured by a seat cushion or a body			0
as awful as it is to think about , recovered bodies can provide critical clues about a flight 's final moments			1
@entity85 said , " take a look at all the information			0
is there burning on the bodies beforehand ? we 'll get autopsies			0
is there soot in the trachea showing that there 's fire on board ? " in the case of @entity66 , extracting the wreckage from the water and reconstructing it was critical to debunking various conspiracy theories			1
witnesses said they saw a streak of light and a fireball , leading to suspicions that terrorists struck the plane with a rocket			0
others blamed a meteor or a missile			0
piecing the aircraft together was necessary to get a fuller picture			2
" we take a look at everything we have here , and what we could n't find anywhere in @entity182 was any evidence of being hit from a missile from the outside , " @entity85 said			2
why were there no phone calls ? findings released three years after flight like that flight , the experience of @entity68 provides clues about what could happen if @entity5 is found at the bottom of the ocean			1
on june 1 , 2009 , @entity68 was en route from @entity197 to @entity198 when communications from the @entity200 ended suddenly			1
its last known position -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports -- and the ocean 's depth hindered search efforts			2
it took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of the wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the surface			0
it took even longer to find the cause of the disaster			2
" we had three autonomous underwater vehicles -- basically unmanned submarines that swim programmed tracks over the sea floor			0
they 'd go back and forth using acoustic sensors to map the sea floor , and from those maps , we could detect the wreckage site , " said @entity224 with the @entity225			0
in may 2011 , the aircraft 's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search			1
it was not until july 2012 that investigators published their report , which blamed the crash on a series of errors by the pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems			0
@entity245 has warned that it does not have the kind of submarine technology used to find the voice and flight data recorders for @entity68			1
so there 's no time to be lost in tracking them down before the batteries powering their locating device run dry			1
@entity254 , also with @entity255 , helped lead the search for the recorders of @entity68			1
he described what would happen once some debris from @entity5 is found , though he stressed there 's still no evidence the plane hit the water			1
because of currents , the wind and new information , the search area is getting bigger by the day			0
" once a piece of the debris is found -- if it did impact on the water -- then you 've got to backtrack that debris to try to find the ' @entity274 ' on where the plane actually hit the water , because that would be the center of the haystack , " @entity254 said			1
" and in that haystack , you 're trying to find bits of that needle -- in fact , in the case of the flight data recorders , you 're looking for a tiny little bit of that needle , " he said			2
' we are flying partially blind ' @entity39 is similarly blunt about the challenges even in finding the two objects picked up the satellite in the southern @entity11 , let alone finding a potential crash site and recovering the plane			0
even with the help of the " best surveillance technology on the planet " on the @entity300 and p - 8 maritime surveillance aircraft , " it 's still really hard in this kind of environment to pick up these little , semi-submerged blips , " he said			1
" you 're looking for something that potentially is n't even there any more			0
" although the technology will pick up subsurface objects , he said , " the problem is , you 've got limited resources ; you 've got limited flying hours			0
" this is a long way away from the @entity43 shore			0
this is at the upper reaches of the flight capacity of these aircraft			2
they can only stay out there for a couple of hours , and this is a massive stretch of water we are talking about trying to cover			0
" so , unfortunately , are flying partially blind here			0
we 've got out - of - date information			0
the currents have moved the flotsam and jetsam to another location which we can not locate			0
" there 's no emanations we are picking up to identify where that would be , and this means it 's really a needle in the haystack			2
" pinger locators the southern @entity11 is often described as one of the most remote locations on @entity336			1
recovery specialists -- as well as the @entity104 -- often use locators to find the ping emanating from a flight recorder of a commercial aircraft			1
" if the debris is verified , then there are pinger locators that are simple ( boat - ) towed hydrophones that can look for the signals of those pingers while they 're still within that 30 - day life expectancy of the battery , " said @entity342 , who runs a @entity344 engineering firm specializing in deep - sea searches of planes and shipwrecks			1
" if that 's possible , that can really give a much better idea of where the wreckage is , " he added			2
the middle of an ocean is a daunting environment , however			0
" but in those conditions and the remoteness of the area , i 'd be rather surprised if they can get a pinger locator out there and get any thing -- because at this water depth , the range is very limited on listening to those pingers , " @entity342 said			2
latest updates on the missing @entity377 jetliner if this is the debris of @entity5 , what happens next ? anger as relatives confront officials difficulties may hamper flight 370 search searching for the plane truth -- amid speculation @entity0 's @entity386 , @entity387 , @entity388 and @entity389 contributed to this report .			1

new : if debris is verified , recovery teams could use ' pinger locators ' to find device
ships , aircraft and helicopters are searching for @entity5
let 's say they find it . would the mystery be solved ?
@entity66 and @entity68 provide clues about what could happen next
