-- when @entity2 traveled to the @entity3 , he went under it			1
the @entity5 , the world 's first nuclear - powered submarine , made history when it reached the @entity3 on august 3 , 1958 , beneath the ice			1
@entity2 , who was part of that @entity12 crew , recalls how this milestone was of much more significance than being a historical first			1
" what we did , " he says , " is really expose 3,000 miles of coastline of the @entity17 " submarines , which submariners call boats , played a pivotal role in intelligence gathering and nuclear deterrence at a time of political tension between the @entity28 and @entity17			1
attack submarines sought out and tracked @entity17 ballistic missile submarines , while @entity32 missile boats tried to keep from being discovered			1
" we did n't want to make any kind of a noise that a fish did n't make , " the 79 - year - old @entity2 remembers			2
the @entity12 may be remembered as a conflict without any battles , but for submariners , the danger on the front lines was real			1
@entity41 started on diesel - electric submarines , including the @entity43 and the @entity44 in 1958			1
cat - and - mouse games of two superpowers aside , risks remain even today for sailors who head out beneath the waves , says @entity41 , now 73			2
" all the submariners , " he says , " when they go to sea , they 're in harm 's way			1
" @entity41 remembers an incident that happened during the turnover of older diesel subs to the @entity60 navy			2
he and other crew members acted as observers during the training phase			1
during a dive , the boat angled down steeply and the propellers shook			0
the sub managed to surface eventually , yet @entity41 insisted the danger was part of the job			0
" we 've all experienced when something went wrong , " @entity41 says			0
before any sailor can be called a submariner , he has to earn his " dolphins , " a pin that 's the equivalent to a pilot 's wings			0
the sailors must qualify on the submarines they are to serve by knowing the systems inside and out			1
the training and testing are rigorous			1
@entity84 , 63 , another @entity12 veteran , qualified on the ballistic missile sub @entity86			1
earning that qualification was an enormous source of pride , he says			0
" when you had those dolphins on , " he says , " you were a submariner			0
you were a part of the brotherhood of the fin			0
" the standards to be part of that " brotherhood " exist to this day			1
surrounded by a hostile environment at all times while submerged , any mistake by a single submariner could prove dangerous or even fatal for the entire crew			0
" my life depended on my other shipmates , " says retired master chief @entity102 , 77 , " and it did n't matter whether they were a seaman or a captain			0
" @entity102 , who spent time in diesel - electric and nuclear - powered boats , served below the waves from 1950 to 1980 , when he retired			2
in addition to meeting these tough standards , submariners also faced the responsibility of knowing their boats might have to launch nuclear warheads at a foreign country			1
@entity84 , who maintained the launching systems for @entity121 missiles during the @entity123 era , says crew members underwent vigorous psychological testing well before even seeing a submarine			2
various scenarios were thrown at them : what if your boat was called to launch a strike ? could you do it ? " the whole idea was really being aware of what the world situation was , what the dire consequences would be if you ever had to go through it and what would happen ... if you did n't have a deterrent force out there to stop something like that from happening , " @entity84 says			0
@entity145 , whose 20 - year @entity32 career took him on a variety of vessels , also served on fleet ballistic missile boats in the 1960s			0
" we just hoped that every time we went to battle stations that it was a drill because we all knew if it was not a drill , home would be in pieces , " says @entity145 , 82			0
all these retired submariners speak of their service with pride , but they are guarded when it comes to details of their missions long ago			2
@entity2 grows nostalgic when recalling how a submarine could be in harbor or along a coastline and go unnoticed			2
or suddenly surface somewhere unexpectedly just to send a message			0
asked if he could describe any of these experiences , he replies with a grin , " not that i care to talk about			0
