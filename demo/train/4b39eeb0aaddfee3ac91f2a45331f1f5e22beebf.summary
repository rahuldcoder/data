@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 used to process medical and dental forms for a living before a debilitating illness forced her into early disability retirement and left her in a simple , no - frills wheelchair -- a rented wheelchair that has cost taxpayers about $ 1,200			1
@entity2 found a wheelchair similar to @entity3 's taxpayer - funded @entity13 wheelchair for a fourth of the price			1
@entity3 says the public should be outraged about her wheelchair			2
why ? she says she could buy a comparable wheelchair on the internet for $ 440 if she had the money			1
it sounded hard to believe that her rented , $ 1,200 taxpayer - funded wheelchair could be bought for $ 440 , so @entity2 decided to check -- and instead found an even better deal			1
@entity2 went to the same company that charges @entity13 for @entity3 's chair , @entity25 , and bought it for $ 349 -- about a fourth of what taxpayers ' have paid for @entity3 's rented wheelchair			1
that 's why this slightly built woman , who lives modestly with her husband in @entity0 , @entity1 , believes her story and her wheelchair underscore the bigger problem of reforming health care in @entity36			1
" now you multiply that by how many people have a manual wheelchair , especially the baby boomers , it multiplies and multiplies and that money could be spent , even a hundred dollars out of that ... could give someone else the options that they need , " @entity3 said			2
reforming health care is at the top of the agenda in @entity50			1
everyone seems to agree this nation 's health care costs and care availability are out of whack			1
fixing it is another problem altogether			0
president @entity58 tried and got push - back as well			0
now president @entity60 says he will do it because @entity36 ca n't put it off any longer			0
but he , too , is finding the way forward is not an easy path			0
terms like " affordability , " " single payer , " " universal coverage , " and an entire lexicon have become part of the health care buzz lingo			1
it is a complex issue with so many facets , so many lobbyists and so many special interests that one proposal seems to result in a competing proposal or proposals , or competing parties with concerns of their own			0
to illustrate how difficult it will be to overhaul @entity36 's health care , @entity2 decided to focus on one item in the nation 's health care bill : a basic wheelchair			1
the wheelchair , in its own small way , @entity2 discovered , gives a glimpse of the contentious and complex debate swirling around health care reform			1
@entity2 interviewed @entity3 and her husband , @entity92 , at a community center in @entity0			1
it is a place the couple visits frequently ; it is free , offers programs , books , entertainment and features a park to stroll in			0
@entity3 sent an e-mail to @entity2 months ago , outraged over the continuing @entity13 payments for a wheelchair that after four years of use is not in the best shape			1
it squeaks and is hard to navigate			0
her ride in it is made more difficult because her husband , retired from the armed services , is also on disability and has trouble getting the wheelchair in and out of the car			0
on days he is not well , he sometimes has trouble pushing her			0
she showed @entity2 her bills and documented the fact that @entity13 is still paying for the wheelchair after all these years			2
@entity13 , with @entity3 's permission , confirmed the payments			2
@entity3 referred us to the internet sites where comparable chairs -- and better ones than hers -- are listed for a fraction of the cost @entity13 pays over time			2
the @entity127 have a limited income and say they can not afford to buy one			0
that 's when @entity2 decided to check @entity3 's story by buying one directly from @entity25 , based in @entity132 , @entity1			1
@entity2 paid cash for the chair after calling one of @entity25 's offices in an @entity138 , @entity139 , suburb			2
@entity25 representatives told the @entity2 buyer that the chair @entity3 had is no longer made but offered the model that is being rented and sold as the replacement model for the one @entity3 still uses			1
when @entity2 asked @entity25 why it rented wheelchairs to the government for $ 1,200 , but sold it to us for $ 349 , the company said it was an " honest , unfortunate mistake			1
" @entity150 , @entity25 executive vice president for government relations , said in a letter that @entity2 " should have been charged $ 949 , in accordance with @entity25 's retail price ...			1
" " since there 's no comparable sale option in the @entity13 system for such a wheelchair , our employee was confused by the sale request and charged the incorrect amount , " @entity150 said			0
but the amount @entity2 paid is comparable to many other companies ' prices on the @entity164			2
a quick check found two firms selling the @entity167 for $ 289.00 and $ 249.00 , including delivery			2
the manufacturer 's suggested retail price is nearly $ 300 less than the corrected @entity25 price			2
@entity25 said its costs are higher because of the stringent paperwork required by the government and because it provides 24 - hour on - call service			0
@entity25 also points out that the cost of the wheelchair over the past four years has been less than 78 cents per day , a bargain because it allows the patient to remain at home			0
wheelchairs are classified as durable medical equipment , along with such items as oxygen tanks and home infusion therapies			0
@entity25 is the nation 's leading provider of home health care products and services , according to its web site			1
the nation 's $ 1 billion annual durable medical cost is only a fraction of @entity13 's $ 444 billion budget last year , but one government officials believe it is time to rein in			0
that 's where this story of the rented wheelchair gets caught between all the interests involved			2
@entity201 sets the rates @entity13 pays and @entity201 determined that wheelchairs should be billed on a monthly rate for 13 months -- the renter has to pay 20 percent of the costs			0
after 13 months , a user can opt to own it -- if the user knows about the rule			0
@entity3 , who worked in claims processing for years , said no one ever told her the wheelchair that barely works for her now is hers if she wants it			2
instead , now that her rental term has ended , she gets billed by @entity25 every six months for service			0
@entity13 pays $ 63 and she pays $ 16			0
@entity217 , one of @entity60 's picks to reform the @entity219 , said it is simply wrong that a wheelchair an individual can buy for $ 349 has cost the government $ 1,200			1
he said the government has a plan to fix it : competitive bidding			1
" the good news is we have new authority right now to use competitive bidding to give the program much more flexibility , " @entity217 said			1
but that 's where the rubber -- or in this case , a wheelchair -- meets the road			0
@entity13 has tried for years to get a bidding project off the ground			0
last year , a bidding project was stopped after two weeks			0
the industry is flat - out against the government 's proposed bidding project , contending it is n't competitive bidding at all			1
opposing a bidding project is a well - funded lobbying industry , small - and durable - equipment businesses and special - interest groups who worry their ill clients wo n't be served if a bidding process as proposed by @entity13 is put in place			1
so @entity2 loaded its wheelchair onto a @entity255 757 to @entity50 and rolled it through the halls of @entity201 to find out why any representative -- not to mention 84 of them ( the number who signed an april letter asking that competitive bidding be put on hold once again ) would object to a plan that @entity13 maintains will save taxpayer money			1
from @entity266 and @entity267 alike , the answer was nearly identical as they sat for interviews next to @entity2 's $ 349 wheelchair			1
" well , you know what ? i am a big believer in competitive bidding , " said rep. @entity272 , a @entity267 from @entity273 , where @entity167 , one of the biggest manufacturers of durable equipment , is based			1
" so at the outset i absolutely concur			0
but this program as it has unfolded , as it 's been developed it really is a competitive bidding process that is n't competitive bidding			1
" rep. @entity282 , a @entity266 from @entity283 , agreed			0
" my hope is that as we look at health care reform that some of those that are working off of theory , if you will , and the federal system will slow down and we look at where the lessons learned should be and we will think long and hard before they move aboard a single - payer or mandated to restrict choice and restrict options for individuals , " said @entity284			1
the @entity300 , which represents many in the durable - equipment industry , said the bidding program is anti-competitive			2
in a statement , the association said the bidding program would " sacrifice care for seniors and people with disabilities " as it " reduces patient access to and choice for medical equipment			0
" the association said competitive bidding will " increase @entity13 costs because it will lead to longer , more expensive hospital stays			1
" but @entity316 , the head of policy and strategy for the retiree advocacy group @entity320 , said what 's really happening is business trying to protect profits -- in this case profits four times the cost of @entity3 's wheelchair rental			2
" it 's an outrage , " @entity316 said			0
" it 's a ripping off of the taxpayer			0
it does n't make any sense to have those kinds of expenses for products that could be bought for so much less			0
" @entity13 again plans to try to get its competitive bidding program started later this year in at least nine markets , although @entity217 said it is unlikely to go into effect until next year			2
as for @entity3 , her four - year - old wheelchair needs replacing			2
she 's reluctantly applied through her doctor for a new one			0
@entity2 's @entity342 contributed to this report .			0

woman : rented , $ 1,200 taxpayer - funded wheelchair can be bought for $ 440
@entity2 found chair that could be bought for a fourth of the price
@entity3 believes her story , wheelchair underscore problem health care reform
*legislators* , companies debate competitive bidding to fix problem
