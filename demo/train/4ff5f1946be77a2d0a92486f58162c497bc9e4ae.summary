@entity0 -- the @entity2 is failing to adequately report , track and fix airport security breaches , according to the @entity5 's inspector general			1
as a result , the @entity2 " does not have a complete understanding " of breaches at the nation 's airports , says a report from the inspector general			1
the report , published earlier this month , was requested by @entity16 @entity15 sen. @entity14 after a series of breaches at @entity19 , including a knife bypassing @entity2 screening , passengers walking around security checkpoints and a dead dog transported without being screened for explosives			1
@entity2 responded to those incidents with " corrective action , " according to the inspector general , but not all the problems received the same treatment			1
the @entity2 took action to fix only 42 % of the security breaches documented at @entity19 , according to the report			2
" there 's no consistency because there is no clear guidance on what to report and when to report , " @entity34 , acting inspector general at the @entity5 , told a congressional hearing on wednesday			1
" one of our recommendations is that they have to have a comprehensive oversight program where they provide clear guidance on how each of the airports need to be reporting and then @entity2 needs to follow through			1
" most of the incidents examined occurred in 2010 , and the report says since then efforts to fix security breach vulnerabilities have improved			0
five other large @entity54 terminals were visited by inspectors for comparison but the airports ' names were withheld from the public report			0
of the six airports visited , records were found detailing efforts to fix the causes of only 53 % of the breaches			0
@entity19 was the lowest - scoring			2
the highest - rated airport reported corrective action in 88 % of the breaches			0
" i 'm going to tell you right now the next incident is going to come from the ground			0
it 's going to come from the shadow of the aircraft , it 's not going to come through the passenger terminal			0
i 'm telling you that , " said rep. @entity77 , @entity78			0
the inspector general also noted that while the agency did have " many programs and initiatives that report and track identified security breaches " they were " not all inclusive or centrally managed			1
" this lack of comprehensive , centralized data was cited as preventing the use of information to " monitor trends or make general improvements to security			0
" problems with how incidents were categorized in reporting also were outlined in the report			0
@entity2 workers at one airport reported " an improper bag handoff incident " in a database as a " sterile area access event " while another airport reported four similar incidents as " security breaches			2
" management at the agency concurred with the inspector general 's report			2
" @entity2 acknowledges that it can further develop and expand its oversight programs for gathering and tracking airport security breaches , " wrote administrator @entity108			1
" @entity2 currently collects thousands of records of incidents and security breaches occurring at airports and other transportation facilities , " @entity2 spokesman @entity111 told @entity1 in an e-mail			2
" @entity2 is coordinating appropriate revisions to relevant @entity119 to develop a single definition of ' @entity121 , ' addressing ( the inspector general 's ) recommendation			1
" @entity1 's @entity124 and @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
