@entity0 was diagnosed with leukemia when he was 4 years old , and when the cancer kept bouncing back , impervious to all the different treatments the doctors tried , his father sat him down for a talk			1
@entity7 explained to @entity0 , who was by then 14 , that doctors had tried chemotherapy , radiation , even a bone marrow transplant from his sister			1
" i explained to him that we 're running out of options , " @entity0 remembers telling his son			1
there was one possible treatment they could try : an experimental therapy at the @entity20			1
he asked his son if he understood what it would mean if this treatment did n't work			2
" he understood he could die , " @entity0 says			1
" he was very stoic			0
" a few months later , @entity0 traveled from his home in @entity25 to @entity26 to become a part of the experiment			1
this new therapy was decidedly different from the treatments he 'd received before : instead of attacking his cancer with poisons like chemotherapy and radiation , the @entity26 doctors taught @entity0 's own immune cells to become more adept at killing the cancer			1
two months later , he emerged cancer - free			2
it 's been six months since @entity0 , now 15 , received the personalized cell therapy , and doctors still can find no trace of leukemia in his system			1
trusting her intuition led to two cancer diagnoses twenty - one other young people received the same treatment at @entity49 , and 18 of them , like @entity0 , went into complete remission -- one of them has been disease - free for 20 months			1
the @entity20 doctors released their findings this weekend at the annual meeting of the @entity55			2
" it gives us hope that this is a cure , " @entity0 's father says			1
" they 're really close			0
i think they 're really onto something			0
" ' a whole new realm of medicine ' at the conference , two other cancer centers -- @entity67 in @entity68 and the @entity69 -- will be announcing results with immunotherapies like the one @entity0 received			1
the results are promising , especially considering that the patients had no success with practically every other therapy			0
" this is absolutely one of the more exciting advances i 've seen in cancer therapy in the last 20 years , " said dr. @entity75 , a hematologist and oncologist at @entity20			0
" we 've entered into a whole new realm of medicine			0
" in the therapy , doctors first remove the patient 's t - cells , which play a crucial role in the immune system			1
they then reprogram the cells by transferring in new genes			0
once infused back into the body , each modified cell multiplies to 10,000 cells			0
these " hunter " cells then track down and kill the cancer in a patient 's body			1
essentially , researchers are trying to train @entity0 's body to fight off cancer in much the same way our bodies fight off the common cold			1
tumor paint : changing the way surgeons fight cancer in addition to the pediatric patients , @entity20 scientists tried the therapy out in 37 adults with leukemia , and 12 went into complete remission			2
eight more patients went into partial remission and saw some improvements in their disease			0
the treatment does make patients have flulike symptoms for a short period of time -- @entity0 got so sick he ended up in the intensive care unit for a day -- but patients are spared some of the more severe and long - lasting side effects of extensive chemotherapy			1
@entity20 will now work with other medical centers to test the therapy in more patients , and they plan to try the therapy out in other types of blood cancers and later in solid tumors			0
a university press release says it has a licensing relationship with the pharmaceutical company @entity139 and " received significant financial benefit " from the trial , and @entity75 and other inventors of the technology " have benefited financially and / or may benefit financially in the future			0
" searching for one - in - a - million cancer cells the big question is whether @entity0 's leukemia will come back			1
the studies have only been going on since 2010 , but so far relapse rates have been relatively low : of the 18 other pediatric patients who went into complete remission , only five have relapsed and of the 12 adults who went into complete remission , only one relapsed			0
some of the adult patients have been cancer - free and without a relapse for more than three years and counting			2
relapses after this personalized cell therapy may be more promising than relapses after chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant , @entity75 explained			0
first , doctors have been delighted to find the reengineered t - cells -- the ones that know how to hunt down and attack cancer -- are still alive in the patients ' bodies after more than three years			1
stigma lingers for deadliest cancer " the genetically modified t - cells have survived , " @entity75 said			2
" they 're still present and functional and have the ability to protect against recurrence			0
" second , before declaring patients in remission , @entity20 doctors scoured especially hard for errant leukemia cells			1
traditionally , for the kind of leukemia @entity0 has , doctors can find one in 1,000 to one in 10,000 cancer cells			1
but @entity20 's technology could find one in 100,000 to one in a million cancer cells , and did n't find any in @entity0 or any of the patients who went into complete remission			1
' it 's not a fluke ' one of the best aspects of this new treatment is that it wo n't be terribly difficult to reproduce at other medical centers , @entity75 said , and one day , instead of being used only experimentally , it could be available to anyone who needed it			2
" our hope is that this can progress really quite quickly , " he said			2
" it wo n't be available to everyone next year , but i do n't think it would take a decade , either			0
" right now patients can only get this therapy if they 're in a study , but dr. @entity207 , director for cellular therapeutics at @entity67 , says he thinks it could become available to all patients in just three to five years			0
" when you have three centers all with a substantial number of patients seeing the same thing -- that these cells work in this disease - you know it 's not a fluke , " he said			2
two days ago , @entity207 became the co-founder of @entity222 , a for - profit biotech start - up company that 's working on immunotherapies			0
" fifteen years ago i was in the lab looking at these cells kill tumor cells in a petri dish and then i saw them kill tumor cells in mice , and then finally in humans , " @entity207 said			0
he says he 'll never forget the first patient he treated , who initially had an enormous amount of cancer cells in his bone marrow			2
then after the therapy , @entity207 looked under the microscope and , in awe , realized he could n't find a single cancer cell			0
" i ca n't describe what that 's like , " he said			0

@entity0 was out of options for *battling* leukemia
he is now cancer free after an experimental treatment
doctors taught @entity0 's immune cells to become adept at killing cancer
experts hope the treatment will quickly become more *widely* available
