-- remember when social media websites were just about sharing fun things ? i 'm talking about the time when @entity5 was essentially a place to post photos of you having a great time and the most serious event shared was when a person changed his or her status from " in a relationship " to " single			1
" but those days are gone			0
social media has now become a place to share deeply personal and often horribly painful events in our lives			1
it has , in essence , become an online group therapy session where people reveal the details of dreadful events from their lives in the hopes it helps them cope and will attract support from others			2
we saw it on display this week with 16 - year - old @entity33 , who was taken hostage by @entity33 for a week after he allegedly killed @entity33 's mother and younger brother			1
within days of being freed , @entity33 went online to the website ask.fm and answered questions from the public about her ordeal			1
and she did n't just respond to a few questions , she fielded a long list of probing questions from " why did n't you run ? " to " are you glad ( @entity33 is ) dead ? " i noticed this evolution in the way people had begun to use social media last year , and at the time , i did n't like it			1
my concern was : why would anyone share the intimate details of tragic events from their lives with people online , many of whom are strangers ? it really hit home this year when a friend posted on @entity5 that he had been diagnosed with cancer			0
i was shocked , first by the news but second by the fact he announced his diagnosis on @entity5			0
typically , this would be the type of news you would share only with family and close friends , and probably in a face - to - face conversation			0
but reading the comments responding to his original posting -- and the comments to his subsequent posts about his treatment -- caused me to change my view on what was appropriate to share on social media			1
the amount of support he received on his @entity5 page was astounding			0
he was touched by it , noting that the outpouring brought him comfort and inspired him to fight the disease even harder			2
many others are sharing the most heartwrenching events in their lives			2
in just the past few weeks , friends on @entity5 or @entity95 have posted information about the deaths of a parent or a grandparent			0
and this week , i saw an even more candid sharing of information when a friend posted on @entity5 that his brother in @entity103 had been shot by the police there during the recent protests			2
he followed that up a few hours later with updates about surgery to save his brother 's life			2
finally , he posted a photo of his deceased brother from the morgue where they identified his body			0
a few weeks ago , @entity119 host @entity118 tweeted live updates from his dying mother 's hospital room to his more than 1 million @entity95 followers			1
some said @entity118 was invading his mother 's privacy while others labeled him as self - centered , focused more on himself than his dying mother			1
but like many others , i found it to be a moving tribute to his mother			2
what sparked this trend to divulge information that had once been revealed only to family and close friends ? there are a few reasons			0
first , it 's clearly therapeutic for many			2
by sharing their painful experiences , it helps the person heal , and the show of support by others bolsters them			1
second , those who have been using social media for years on a daily basis have grown accustomed to sharing events and experiences from everyday life			1
we are now extending the scope of what we will share from our lives			0
finally , i believe there 's a connection between a willingness to share private aspects of our lives and the reality tv show world in which we have been immersed for over a decade			0
on a nightly basis , we see people share their triumphs and tragedies , be it on shows like " @entity171 " or " @entity172 " or more contrived ones like " @entity174 " or " keeping up with the @entity175			0
" they have made it easier and more acceptable for us to do the same			0
to me , the best thing about this new trend is that you get to control it			0
it 's your choice whether to disclose deeply personal information			1
those who find it unnerving or inappropriate can keep that information secret			0
but for the rest , social media may end up being a less expensive but helpful form of therapy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

@entity192 : social media evolved from sharing trivial matters to more personal ones
@entity33 answered personal questions about her *abduction*
@entity119 host @entity118 tweeted from his dying mother 's hospital room
@entity192 : sharing more is a good thing , if it helps bring comfort to those who suffer
