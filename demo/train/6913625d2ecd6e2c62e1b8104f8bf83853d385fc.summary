@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's @entity7 postponed a rare public hearing for the country 's secretive and powerful spy agency thursday , a lawyer for one of the alleged victims of the agency said			1
long thought to be untouchable , the @entity11 , or @entity11 , has been ordered to produce seven men it 's accused of holding since 2010 and explaining the deaths of four other detainees			1
but attorney @entity15 told @entity2 the court had delayed the hearing until friday because other proceedings took up much of the day			0
@entity15 said it was clear the lawyer for the @entity11 , who was present when the postponement was announced , had not brought the seven detainees to court as ordered			2
the spy agency 's lawyer presented the court with medical certificates for four of them to show they were hospitalized , and he asked permission from the court to present confidential letters explaining the whereabouts of the other three men , @entity15 said			1
it 's not yet clear if the spy agency will produce the detainees at friday 's hearing			1
for @entity40 , the proceedings are personal			0
her son , @entity41 , was one of the four men who died while in the custody of the @entity11 , the family claims			1
" he had so many marks on his body , " @entity40 said , pointing to numerous scars in a picture of her son 's corpse			0
" when they showed me the body , he was just skin and bones			0
" the @entity11 blamed the 29 - year - old 's death on natural causes			1
his mother said the scars prove the agency tortured and killed her son			1
" it 's absolute lies , " @entity40 said			0
" first , i read in the papers @entity41 committed suicide , then they said he died of tuberculosis			2
when someone lies they should at least remember which lie they used			0
" her outrage has the 60 - year - old doing what few others in @entity1 have ever dared think -- taking on the @entity11 and demanding answers			1
those who know the @entity11 's reputation know few people have ever challenged @entity1 's most feared and shadowy institution			1
the spy agency has long been accused of backing and toppling politicians , using militant groups as proxies and backing extrajudicial killings			2
the @entity11 has long denied the accusations , but no one from the agency ever speaks publicly on camera and no one from the @entity11 has ever been put on trial			2
because it has the backing of the @entity7 , the case of @entity41 could be different			2
the court has ordered the @entity11 to explain why @entity41 , his two brothers and eight other men were arrested and why four of them died			1
" we are fighting for the rule of law , " @entity15 said			0
@entity41 and his brothers were law abiding citizens who printed @entity104 at a shop in @entity106 , @entity15 said			0
he did acknowledge that all of the detainees were suspects in several militant attacks , but said they were acquitted of the charges in 2010			0
a lawyer for the @entity11 told the @entity7 that the spy agency did detain the men for further questioning but said they were set free			1
the @entity11 denies any role in their deaths and holds to its claim that they died of natural causes			2
for @entity1 , the case is potentially a crucial test of the nation 's democracy			1
for a grieving mother , it 's a chance for justice			0
" i can only hope that whoever has done this injustice to me , i hope their families suffer like i have , " @entity40 said			0
" i hope one day they feel my pain			0
" @entity2 's @entity133 and journalist @entity134 contributed to this report			0
