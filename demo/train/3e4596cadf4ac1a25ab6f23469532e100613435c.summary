@entity0 -- there 's not much to cheer inside the once venerable @entity3 lately , but veterans are thrilled that at this moment of crisis that " @entity8 " agreed to take the helm			1
before wednesday , people outside of the @entity3 were n't familiar with @entity10 when president @entity11 appointed him to be the interim head of the agency			1
but , within the @entity3 , he is still well known and highly regarded			1
fellow agents call @entity18 " because he looks the part of a priest but also because of how he goes about his business			0
@entity10 has a good relationship with both @entity20			2
and in addition to being in charge of protecting the president as the director of the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , he worked closely with the first couple on the protection arrangements for the daughters			1
the @entity20 have been generally happy with that according to several colleagues that served with him at the time			0
one likely knock on @entity10 that has been mentioned since his temporary appointment is that he was in charge of @entity25 at the time of the infamous @entity39 gate crashing incident in 2009			2
even though @entity25 agents have little to do with guest clearance at events , when the crisis exploded , @entity10 offered to resign			2
the director at the time , @entity45 , said no. not telling @entity11 of elevator breath was ' final straw ' for @entity48 there was some talk of @entity10 coming back when @entity45 left and before @entity51 was appointed , for either the number one or number two job , but he preferred to stay in the private sector at the time			1
@entity10 left his job as executive director of @entity59 for this role			1
what remains unanswered about @entity10 is whether he wants the job permanently or whether pressure will be too great for an outsider to be chosen			2
@entity3 insiders think that it would be a mistake to bring in an outsider			0
they argue for a new management type as a number two but think you need a " take the bullet " person as director			0
they did n't know if that argument will carry the day in this environment			0
but now that @entity48 is gone , agency veterans are thrilled @entity10 agreed to come back			0
they were worried the outsider thing would be immediate			0

some *members* of the @entity3 call the new interim director " @entity8 . "
since leaving *active* duty , @entity10 has worked in security at @entity59
@entity10 worked for years on the personal protection team for presidents @entity88 and @entity11
