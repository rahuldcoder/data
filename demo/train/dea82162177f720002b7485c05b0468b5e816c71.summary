@entity0 , @entity1 -- enough with the texting , a @entity1 judge told @entity5 after hearing testimony about thousands of text messages -- some of them explicit -- the @entity1 teenager reportedly sent to her underage girlfriend after being ordered not to while awaiting trial on charges of having sex with the girl			1
judge @entity15 sent @entity5 , 19 , to jail tuesday , ordering her held on bond pending trial			2
she 'll also be limited to communicating with her lawyers , guards , fellow inmates and perhaps a few choice visitors			0
@entity5 was 18 when she was charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after allegedly having sexual relations with the girl , who was 14			1
@entity15 made his ruling after an @entity29 detective testified about the contents of an @entity31 that @entity5 had given the younger girl -- including more than 20,000 text messages , " explicit " videos and nude pictures -- despite a court order that the two not communicate , electronically or otherwise			1
" it 's overwhelming that ms. @entity5 has chosen to violate the conditions of her bond deliberately and willfully on several occasions , " @entity15 said in explaining his decision			1
in addition to the extensive exchange of messages since march -- which began days after the no - contact order was issued -- detective @entity46 further testified that he 'd learned the two had secretively met as recently as a few weeks ago			2
under cross-examination , @entity46 noted that in some cases , the younger girl initiated contact , though he emphasized that @entity5 had given her the @entity31 on which they illicitly communicated			1
and the detective added , the younger teenager " has not told me the full truth in a couple of my interviews			0
" after @entity46 left the stand , @entity5 's lawyer , @entity60 , did not dispute that there " has been some contact with the victim " and her client			1
" we 're not going to contest all the evidence , " @entity60 said tuesday in court			0
" but what we would ask for is that the defendant ( be able to be ) bonded out , to be placed on house arrest without any electronic communication of any kind			1
... we think that would keep the judicial process safe			0
" the judge , though , thought differently			0
" she simply ca n't be trusted to abide by the court order , " @entity15 said of @entity5			1
the court hearing tuesday was graphic and , for @entity5 , emotional			1
she held a tissue in her handcuffed hands that she repeatedly used to wipe tears from her eyes			0
the proceeding marked the latest turn in a story that first captured the nation 's attention months ago			0
in a written statement wednesday , @entity60 slammed the prosecutors for disclosing sordid detail			1
@entity5 's family says the relationship was consensual , with their lawyer claiming authorities would n't have gone after her if it had involved a male and a female instead of two teenage girls			1
in @entity1 , a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to consent to sex			0
@entity5 's parents went public with their story after their daughter was charged			1
they essentially accused the alleged victim 's family of going after their daughter because she is gay , while @entity5 spoke out about her fears of paying for a relationship that she did n't think was wrong			1
" i 'm scared of losing my life , the rest of my life , " she said earlier this year , " not being able to go to college or be around kids , be around my sisters and my family			0
" the younger girl 's family , though , said that was n't true and insisted that they were only trying to protect their own daughter			1
" we had no other alternative but to turn to the law , use it basically as a last resort , " the victim 's father , @entity120 , had previously told @entity2 affiliate @entity123			2
sheriff : teen sex case is about age , not gay rights this debate has been playing out publicly since @entity5 was charged , during which time prosecutors offered her at least two plea deals			1
the most recent one -- offered in july , according to @entity138 , the state attorney for @entity1 's 19th judicial circuit -- would have led to @entity5 being subject to a curfew and having to do community service , but avoiding jail time and not having to register as a sex offender			1
but @entity5 's defense team did n't accept either plea deal			1
then , on august 6 , the victim 's father alerted authorities to the @entity31 and its contents , @entity46 said			1
he interviewed the underage girl the next day , when she told him she 'd given @entity151 her locker combination and found the @entity31 in her locker on the last day @entity5 was in their school			2
this type of @entity31 allows people to exchange text messages and other media			0
on some of those texts , @entity5 indicated that she understood that such communications violated the court order			1
" no matter what , if they find out that we talked , i 'm going to jail until the trial starts , " she wrote , according to @entity46			0
pictures on the @entity31 showed the young couple together and a nude @entity5			2
there was also video of a naked @entity5 touching herself in a sexual manner , the detective testified			2
authorities determined these images originated at @entity5 's home in the weeks and months after the no - contact order had been issued , said @entity46			1
@entity60 , in her wednesday statement , upbraided prosecutors for using frank and graphic detail in a court filing			1
" what happened to a ( statements ) like ' numerous texts and inappropriate language ' without details ? " she wrote			0
with the school year starting , she said , " i can only imagine the chatter at the school			0
" in the end , @entity60 wrote , two teen students were " involved in a consensual relationship			0
" " yes one that under the current law is a crime , but still consensual			0
it was brought to an abrupt end and the older ' adult ' teen faces up to 30 years in prison			0
" she said the younger girl " can not comprehend the seriousness of the matter because it was something she consented to			0
" " her opinion is ignored by the state , " @entity60 said			0
the girl has been " interrogated by the @entity205 , taken to a church that labels being gay a sin , has the @entity209 thrown at her , all of her things in her room boxed up and taken from her , is apparently hit by her parents , and clearly yelled at for lying by her father in the presence of detective @entity46 at the school in a subsequent interview			2
" under the circumstances , she 's been confused , scared , and feels no one is listening to her , @entity60 said			0
" she already tried to speak to @entity5 's mother @entity222 who shut her down			1
so she turns to the only person who could ( possibly ) understand in her eyes and a person she clearly does not want to see hurt and that is @entity5			2
she wants to try to save her and in doing so she just causes the walls to continue to tumble down			0
" @entity5 , who turned 19 last week , was booked into detention monday night after her bail bond company declined to secure her $ 5,000 bond any longer and picked her up			2
her family has not commented on the latest developments in the case			0
the original charges against @entity5 carry a maximum of 15 years in prison upon conviction			2
based on the newly revealed evidence , prosecutors filed a new charge against @entity5 for " transmission of material harmful to minor by electronic equipment			2
" @entity2 's @entity245 contributed to this report .			0
