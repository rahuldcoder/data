-- the silly season is upon us : the time during an election year when those trying to muck up the other side throw all sorts of nonsense about a candidate onto the public wall			1
@entity12 , because she 's the @entity11 's presumptive 2016 front - runner , has become the target du jour			1
frankly , i do n't know how public figures get through it			1
i 'm reminded of @entity18 's remark , which i 'm paraphrasing : " it 's impossible to be paranoid in @entity20 because the definition of paranoia is the ' false belief that someone is out to get you			1
' in @entity20 , someone is always out to get you			1
" the latest craziness comes from @entity29 , who publishes the @entity30 , the political equivalent of an online supermarket tabloid			1
drudge funnels anonymous propaganda into the mainstream media , propaganda it might not buy otherwise			1
that 's the secret to his success			1
of course , some of what he reports is solid stuff			2
but there is space to fill daily			2
so , somewhat like a @entity47 reporter who dreams up his day 's " scoop " while showering , @entity30 teases his readers with innuendo and fluff			1
so often , it 's hard to tell the difference between fluff and fact			2
maybe @entity30 is more entertainer than reporter			1
i imagine he enjoys baiting the mainstream media , then watching it look foolish when his story is debunked			2
take , for example , his tweet about @entity12 , which caused something of a media firestorm			1
@entity67 did a story on @entity69 , and the photographer taking the picture for the front cover asked @entity69 to stand by a lawn chair , grab the top , and lean into the camera			2
only the top part of the chair showed after the picture was cropped for publication			2
so @entity29 tweeted the picture , asking , " is @entity81 a @entity82 ? " that was at 12:16 p.m. on june 4			2
by " coincidence , " 74 minutes later , at 1:30 p.m. , @entity85 's political division tweeted : " is that a walker ? @entity12 's latest magazine cover is raising eyebrows			1
" that may be a record time from right - wing hype - and - blarney to validation from a major publication			2
drudge 's tweet fits in with @entity98 's orchestrated charge in mid-may that maybe @entity12 was " brain damaged " because of a fall she suffered			1
the idea was to portray her as physically unfit to be president and save the right a billion or two of negative advertising in 2016			2
but it was n't true			0
since her recovery , we 've witnessed a vigorous @entity12			1
other pictures in that same issue of people show her animated , smiling and even combative			0
apparently , though @entity30 ( and perhaps @entity85 , which had no problem accepting his " con " ) wanted to turn @entity98 's " will it stick to the wall " into a meme			1
how long will the media let this tweetle - dumb linger ? @entity120 president @entity119 also took a pot shot at @entity69 , calling her " a weak woman			0
" " it 's better not to argue with women , " @entity119 said , " but mrs. @entity12 has never been too graceful in her statements			1
" referring to @entity69 's comparison of his aggressive actions in the @entity129 to @entity130 's with @entity131 , @entity119 ironically said , " when people push boundaries too far , it 's not because they are strong but because they are weak			0
" then @entity119 delivered his zinger : " but maybe weakness is not the worst quality for a woman			0
it 's one thing to take on a world leader like @entity12 , but an altogether different matter to offend half the planet while doing it			1
his " it 's better not to argue with women , " clearly shows @entity119 learned from his domestic encounters			0
@entity119 is a home - grown @entity120 social conservative			0
he considers the @entity149 degenerate for granting human rights to women and gays			0
if he had been born an @entity155 , he and the @entity154 fame would likely be at one another 's backyard barbecues			0
i ca n't help but wonder if @entity119 would consider the following statements from @entity69 as strength if a male had said them : referring to @entity163 's " i looked into his soul , " @entity69 said , " i could have told ( @entity163 ) he was a @entity166 agent ; by definition he does n't have a soul			0
" @entity169 ran the quote with the observation , " this is n't going to play well in @entity172			0
" now we know it did n't			0
being weak is not a @entity69 hallmark ; some @entity177 supporters cautioned him to hire a food - taster if @entity69 joined his cabinet			0
perhaps @entity119 considers referring to @entity120 as " despicable " for vetoing @entity181 sanctions against @entity182 , and calling his election possibly fraudulent being " weak			0
" or maybe he needs a dictionary			0
we can expect a lot more to be said about @entity12 , since her memoir , " @entity187 , " is coming out			1
i 'm sure it will reflect her strengths , and weaknesses			0
i 'm sure that on some issues it will provide clarification , and on others , controversy			0
and , unfortunately , i 'm also sure some in the media will be right there with some tweetle - dumb about it			0
join us on @entity202 / @entity201 .			0

@entity204 *chastises* the wave of politically driven attacks that seem just for sport
@entity12 , she argues , is the current target of those " silly " attacks from @entity30 and others
to paraphrase @entity18 : " in @entity20 , someone is always out to get you . "
