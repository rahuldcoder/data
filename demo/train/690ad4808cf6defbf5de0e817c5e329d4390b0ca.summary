-- @entity2 officials are vowing to improve security at @entity5 diplomatic posts around the world , some before the end of the year			1
those promises were repeated thursday in @entity9 in a hearing before the @entity11 , the first of two sessions in which deputy @entity15 @entity14 and @entity16 testified about the deadly attack on the @entity5 consulate in @entity19 , @entity20			1
" we 've learned some very hard , and painful lessons in @entity19 , and we are already acting on them , " @entity16 told senators			1
" we have to do better			0
" the two testified the @entity2 deployed five teams to assess security at 19 @entity5 diplomatic posts in 13 countries			1
they said the department partnered with the @entity31 to send 35 additional @entity32 detachments -- about 225 @entity32 -- to medium - and high - threat posts with the hope the additional @entity32 would be deterrents against any attack attempts			1
also , the department wants to hire more than 150 diplomatic security personnel -- an increase of 5 % over current staffing -- and provide them with equipment and training			2
the hearings follow a scathing independent report released tuesday that blamed " systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies " for inadequate security amid the attack that killed four @entity5 , including ambassador @entity47			1
this week 's report and hearings mark a significant chapter in the winding saga surrounding the events of september 11 , 2012			2
that night , the consulate became engulfed in flames			2
cameras captured images of a huge crowd of people in the streets -- some waving @entity20 flags -- around the consulate , before gunmen descended on the compound			1
the assault was ultimately determined to be a terrorist attack			2
@entity47 , a lifelong diplomat admired by many of different political parties , had previously written diplomatic correspondence warning that @entity72 - linked militants were growing in strength in an enclave not far from the city			2
@entity14 ' and @entity16 ' appearance on @entity77 marks the first time officials of their level have spoken about the attack			0
both are top advisers to secretary of state @entity83 , who is not able to testify because she is ill. @entity84 ordered the review in the aftermath of the attack			1
such reports are mandated by @entity89 when @entity5 working on behalf of the @entity5 government are killed overseas			2
the 39 - page unclassified version of the report concludes that the leadership failures resulted in a security plan " that was inadequate for @entity19 and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place			1
" @entity16 told senators he 's leading a task force to implement 29 recommendations in the review board report			1
some of the recommendations will be implemented before the end of the year			0
" we accept every one of them , " @entity16 said			0
" the undersecretary of political affairs , the undersecretary for management , the director general of the @entity106 and the deputy legal adviser will work with me to drive this forward , " @entity16 said			0
the task force has already met to translate the report 's recommendations into 60 specific action items , he told senators			1
" we 've assigned every single one to the responsible bureau for immediate implementation , and several will be completed by the end of this calendar year , " he said			0
he promised to work with @entity89 to make sure those recommendations become reality			0
four @entity2 officials were disciplined after the release of the report			0
one resigned , and three others have been placed on administrative leave , spokeswoman @entity128 said			0
on thursday , @entity16 also asked that @entity89 provide the department with more money to pay for ramped - up security			2
sen. @entity135 , widely considered the leading candidate to succeed @entity84 , seemed to agree that the department should get more funds			0
he said in the hearing that spending on @entity5 missions overseas must increase , and the system that requests and delivers that money must be streamlined			1
in the past year , $ 650 billion was spent on military budgets , while the budgets for international affairs were less than one - tenth of the @entity31 's , the @entity144 senator said			0
sen. @entity148 , a @entity149 from @entity150 , said he was " dismayed " that the hearing was centered on additional money for the @entity2 in the absence of a review of how the agency spends the money it already has			0
" we have no idea whether the @entity2 is using its money wisely or not , " he said			0
yet he said the department knew about the threats posed in the days before the attack , based on incoming cables , and should have requested funds to support the situation in @entity19			1
@entity16 testified that the @entity2 has already requested additional funds for its 2013 budget			0
when asked whether @entity84 had heard of the security concerns prior to the @entity19 attack , @entity14 said the conversations with @entity84 and senior level officials were mainly focused on the overall general security picture in @entity20 , but there was a general awareness of the deteriorating security situation in the eastern part of the country			1
@entity84 is recovering from a stomach virus and concussion but is expected to appear before the @entity180 next month to discuss the @entity19 attack , according to rep. @entity181 , @entity182 , the outgoing chairwoman of the panel			1
@entity14 testified about other actions he and officials are taking to tighten relations with countries like @entity20 that are still shaky after recent revolutions that toppled dictators			2
@entity14 said he 'd just gotten back from @entity190 , where a suspect in the @entity19 attack is being detained			1
" i believe we 're making some progress there , " the deputy secretary offered			0
there was a short portion of the @entity11 hearing that touched on the controversy surrounding comments by @entity201 , the @entity5 ambassador to the @entity202 , describing the @entity19 attack in the days following the incident			1
@entity205 said on sunday news programs in the days following the attack that it was the result of a protest against an online @entity210 film			0
she 's been heavily criticized for those statements , to the point that she withdrew her name for consideration as the next secretary of state to avoid what she called a " lengthy , disruptive , and costly " confirmation process			2
critics said @entity205 's comments were out of line with the true intelligence about the incident , and were an attempt by the administration to avoid tying it to terrorism			0
@entity228 @entity227 sen. @entity227 asked @entity14 about @entity205 's statements			0
" what happened in @entity19 was clearly a terrorist attack , " @entity14 replied			1
" i am convinced my colleagues in the administration and intelligence community operated in good faith			0
" @entity0 's @entity236 in @entity9 contributed to this report .			2
