-- @entity1 has decided to do " a @entity6 " by crowd - sourcing and letting readers pick some of the books it will publish			1
the publisher 's aptly titled @entity8 imprint targets readers in the market for a good young adult romance			1
fans of young adult fiction are a passionate community and they know what they like			0
@entity17 , a veteran of children 's publishing known for her work with popular series like " the @entity22 " and " @entity23 , " was eager to find a new way to hear what readers want			1
after witnessing the success of self - published authors like @entity29 and @entity30 , @entity17 realized that much of the talent being surfaced by readers was n't reaching her or other publishers through agents			1
she wanted to establish a direct way for readers and writers to connect with @entity1 and fill the gap			2
two years ago , she put out a call for @entity1 employees to attend a lunch meeting about how @entity1 could find these teen romance stories			0
soon , the book version of " @entity44 " was born , built by volunteers within the company who had a passion for young adult fiction			2
the @entity8 site launched in september 2013			1
unpublished writers submitted their manuscripts and users read and voted on their favorite stories , using comments and a swoon index measuring the emotions the stories triggered			2
out of the reader favorites , @entity60 's team of editors would award publishing contracts to a few writers each season			1
@entity17 's goal is six books a year from @entity60 , selected from the voting pool for spring / summer , fall and winter			1
while @entity8 is focused only on romantic young adult fiction , @entity70 president @entity69 believes the crowd - sourcing model could work for other genres like sci - fi , mystery and romance -- anything with a " rabid reader base that is engaged and eager to share their opinions			1
" the first book published was @entity83 's " a little something different " in august			1
@entity83 , a librarian who specializes in books for teens , saw @entity17 talking about @entity60 and its quest for fresh manuscripts in an interview			1
as a librarian , @entity83 had a good idea of what teens were looking for and not finding			0
one student expressed a desire to read about two characters with parallel lives who ca n't seem to meet			0
@entity83 wondered what the familiar trope might look like if told from multiple perspectives of people who witness the two characters ' missed connections			0
after a couple of weeks of planning , @entity83 wrote the story in six days and submitted it to @entity60 in november 2013			1
" i do n't think i 'll ever have that kind of magic again , " she said			0
@entity83 started seeing feedback soon after posting the story and she became obsessed with checking the comments and ranking			0
" there is something to be said about constructive criticism from strangers , because they are n't worried about ending the friendship , " @entity83 said			0
" and what 's great about swoon is when a story starts to gain traction , the whole community takes notice			2
" on a snowy day in february , @entity83 found out she had been awarded a publishing contract			0
@entity17 said that @entity83 's story connected with @entity119 readers and the editorial staff because of its quirky points of view and refreshing lightness			2
@entity83 and other @entity119 writers have formed a debut author support group , sharing advice , asking questions and exchanging laughs over email and social media			0
the group will continue to grow as @entity60 publishes more writers			1
it 's exactly the kind of community @entity17 envisioned for @entity60			1
" writers who are new to writing can get a nurturing community , so that they learn how to write and they are benefiting from being on the site whether they get published or not , " @entity17 said			2
" people are commenting on their work in a constructive way and helping them			0
" @entity17 and her team post writing advice on the @entity119 blog to mentor and encourage users on the art of crafting stories			0
they also want to " pull back the curtain " on the publishing industry for writers			2
@entity8 has hired @entity163 , former consumer marketing director at @entity164 , as its director			1
this enables @entity17 to focus on her imprint , @entity1 , as well as think more creatively about opportunities for @entity60			1
in this venture , the publishing industry is learning , too			0
" when we go to edit the books that we 've chosen , we gather the reader comments and many times they say things that we have n't thought of , " @entity17 said			0
" they 're choosing book covers we would n't have chosen			0
we are really cultivating a community of writers and readers and we 're grateful to the readers -- they 're doing a lot of the commenting , a lot of the work and expanding the definition of what we know appeals to people			0

@entity8 lets readers vote on the books they want published
the first book published by @entity60 was " a little something different " in august
swoon will publish 6 books a year ; the new model opens up the industry , says a publisher
