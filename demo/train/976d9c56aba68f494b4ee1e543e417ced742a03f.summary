-- a @entity3 orbiter has beamed back its first images of the far side of the moon , including scenes of a massive crater caused by an ancient cosmic impact , the space agency announced wednesday			1
@entity3 released 30 seconds of video from one of the twin probes that arrived in lunar orbit on december 31 and january 1			1
the @entity15 orbiter passed over the moon from its north to south poles , revealing a new view of the @entity19 , a 560 - mile basin along the border between the near and far sides of the satellite			0
also visible was the smaller @entity25 crater near the lunar south pole , which has a star - shaped peak at its center from what @entity3 says was a comet or asteroid impact			0
@entity15 and sister ship flow are part of the space agency 's grail program			0
for 82 days , their instruments will chart the lunar gravitational field , giving scientists a peek into what goes on beneath the surface -- and possibly an insight into how the @entity43 and its neighbors formed			1
as for the " far side of the moon , " as @entity3 says on its website , the time it takes the moon to make one rotation on its axis is the same amount of time it takes the moon to orbit around the @entity43			2
" so , " @entity3 explains , " one ' side ' of the moon is always facing the @entity43 , and the other ' side ' is always facing away from the @entity43			0

a 30 - second @entity3 video scans the far side of the moon
it came from one of two probes that entered lunar orbit around @entity67 's
@entity69 are to chart lunar gravitational field for 82 days
