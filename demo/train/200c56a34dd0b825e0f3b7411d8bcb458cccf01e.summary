a beam of light is supposed to shine off into infinity , but when @entity3 and @entity4 whip out their lightsabers for some spark - flying action , the light blades extrude like stick deodorant and then just stop			1
it 's like they 're sticks of light - matter			1
@entity11 may have made that stuff up , but now , scientists at @entity14 and @entity15 have actually made that stuff -- not enough for a lightsaber , only a subatomic smidgeon			1
but even that much is a big deal			0
light - matter existed previously only in theory , but now , for the first time , it has been observed in reality , researchers from the @entity21 say			1
to oversimplify things , we 'll say that photons are subatomic particles that make up light			2
they have no detectable mass the way most matter does , and usually , they do n't stick together			1
you can shoot two lasers at each other , and the photons will pass right through one another			0
but physicists @entity39 and @entity41 recently got them to stick together to form molecules			2
they published the results of their work in the science journal nature this week			0
scientists create mini-brains from stem cells the newly created photon molecules do n't behave like traditional light , but more like a lightsaber , @entity39 said			1
" the physics of what 's happening in these molecules is similar to what we see in the movies			2
" but do n't picture yourself swashbuckling with a lightsaber just yet			2
as in the creation of pretty much all unusual matter , scientists have to produce extreme conditions in laboratories that ca n't exist naturally anywhere on @entity68			1
they pumped atoms of rubidium , a kind of metal , into a vacuum chamber -- air would otherwise rapidly alter them			0
this created a metal cloud that they cooled down with lasers to about -450 degrees @entity79 , near what is called absolute zero			0
that makes atoms almost stand still			0
then they fired photons into the atom cloud			0
the photons , elements of light , did not shoot through at the speed of light but acted a little like regular matter instead			1
they bumped into the atoms in a way similar to the way regular matter would			1
in the process , the photons slowed down enough to bump into each other and bond into molecules			0
scientists confirm new element 115 after atoms collide though that 's fascinating , it does n't make for a handy lightsaber			2
but it could help in the future development of super computers known as quantum computers , @entity39 said			0
and with some work , scientists could make whole crystals out of light			2
so , if @entity3 shows up with a lightsaber , your great - grandchildren may be able to throw photon rocks at him			1
but do n't count on it			0
follow @ @entity121 on @entity122 for more space and science news			0

when @entity3 and @entity4 whip out lightsabers , the blades look like sticks of light - matter
light usually wo n't stick together like regular matter , but scientists have made it happen
the new light - matter acts like it does in the movies , scientists say
but they have only created subatomic *amounts* of it , not nearly enough for a lightsaber
