a group of independent experts -- who prodded authorities to release satellite data on @entity6 -- says it thinks it knows the approximate location of the missing aircraft			1
five separate computer models all place the plane in a tight cluster of spots in the south @entity13 â€” hundreds of miles southwest of the previous search site			1
" we recommend that the search for @entity6 be focused in this area , " the group said in a statement late tuesday			1
" while there remain a number of uncertainties and some disagreements as to the interpretation of aspects of the data , our best estimates of a location of the aircraft ( is ) near 36.02 @entity30 , " according to the statement , which was approved by 10 named experts			0
the group opted to release its statement late tuesday in advance of a @entity36 documentary on the missing plane , and ahead of the @entity40 government 's announcement on the focus of the search , so that there would be no question about the independence of the group 's findings , said one member of the group , @entity50 co-founder @entity48			1
" we wanted to get our best estimate out , " @entity48 said			0
the group believes that after the @entity54 circumnavigated @entity55 , for reasons that are still unknown , the plane traveled south at an average speed of 470 knots , probably at a consistent altitude and constant heading , @entity48 said			1
all five computer models developed by the experts place the aircraft in a " pretty tight cluster ... plus or minus 50 miles of each other , " he said			1
the plane and its 239 occupants vanished march 8 while flying from @entity67 to @entity68			1
in a blog post , group member @entity69 called the recommended search site " our best estimate -- but not the only possible -- location for a potential search			1
" meanwhile , a team of government experts and @entity77 employees is re-evaluating the data before pinpointing where to resume the search			2
on wednesday the agency overseeing the search said the analysis was " nearly complete " and it expects to announce the new search site by the end of june			1
@entity40 government authorities only recently acknowledged that acoustic pings heard two months ago are now believed to be unrelated to the aircraft 's data recorders , or " black boxes			0
" the ad hoc group of independent specialists came together through web sites of two experts , @entity95 of @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity69 of @entity98 , @entity99			0
several members of the group initially cast doubts on @entity77 's conclusions that the plane had flown south , saying the publicly available information from @entity106 and @entity77 was insufficient to draw that conclusion			2
the plane could have flown north , landing or crashing along an arc extending from @entity110 to @entity111			0
but shortly after @entity106 released raw satellite data on may 27 , several of the loose confederation of scientists agreed it provided sufficient data to show the plane had flown south			2
the " breakthrough piece of information , " @entity48 said , was that the satellite terminal on the aircraft had been programmed to use a simplified assumption about the location of the satellite			0
the terminal assumed that the satellite was geostationary -- fixed over a spot on the equator -- when , in fact , it drifted to the north and south			0
over the past few weeks , the group continued to exchange information through emails and through postings on the web sites			0
the group worked five or six hours tuesday exchanging some 120 emails in drafting the statement on the possible location of @entity6			2
@entity48 said he believes authorities were narrowing in on the correct search site , but were thrown off course when searchers detected acoustic pings northwest of @entity40			1
" it 's my personal opinion that the official search team weighed too heavily " on the acoustic pings , he said			0
@entity48 said the informal group of experts has volunteered to work with the @entity147 and the @entity148			0
but , while the government agencies have been polite , they have been reticent to release additional information that could further help the independent group , he said			0
