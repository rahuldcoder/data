@entity0 -- a top @entity3 @entity2 has offered a pair of amendments to an immigration reform bill bolstering rights for same - sex couples , a politically risky move that threatens to shatter @entity11 support for the sweeping legislation			1
@entity16 sen. @entity15 's @entity14 's amendments would recognize same - sex marriages in which one spouse is an @entity19 , and also would allow @entity19 citizens to sponsor foreign - born same - sex partners for green cards as long as there 's proof of a committed relationship			1
they were among dozens of amendments filed with the @entity28 on tuesday as the panel prepares to take up the legislation later this week			1
" for immigration reform to be truly comprehensive , it must include protections for all families , " @entity14 said			2
" we must end the discrimination that gay and lesbian families face in our immigration law			2
" other amendments proposed by committee members include a proposal by @entity42 sen. @entity41 to significantly cut the number of foreign workers granted admission to the @entity19 under the bill			1
gay rights plan clouds immigration reform prospects " this bill ( as currently written ) would authorize a dramatic surge in permanent low - skill and chain migrationâ € ” and would bring in millions more temporary foreign workersâ € ” at a time when 90 million @entity19 are outside the labor force and nearly 50 million are on food stamps , " sessions said			1
" the result would be lower wages and more unemployment			0
" @entity62 sen. @entity61 filed proposals to boost visas for high - skilled workers , and require both dna identification and proof of payment of all back taxes for any undocumented immigrant seeking legal status , among other things			1
the @entity28 , chaired by @entity14 , is currently considering the 844 - page bill filed by the so - called " @entity74 " -- four @entity75 and four @entity76 who labored for months to bridge a cavernous ideological divide on the hot button issue			1
four members of the group -- republicans @entity82 of @entity84 and sen. @entity85 of @entity86 , and democrats @entity87 of @entity88 and @entity89 of @entity90 -- are also members of the @entity28			0
the gang of eight 's bill creates a 13 - year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants while strengthening border security and bringing dramatic change to labor policy on @entity19 's farms			1
if enacted , the plan would constitute the first overhaul of the nation 's immigration policy since 1986			2
proponents say the change is necessary to permanently and fairly resolve the status of roughly 11 million undocumented residents			2
critics insist the proposed change amounts to amnesty , rewarding those who chose to break the country 's immigration laws			2
@entity115 , director of immigration policy at the left - leaning @entity116 , told @entity1 it 's unlikely the narrowly divided 18 - member @entity3 committee would make significant changes to the legislation			1
" members of the @entity74 have indicated they 'll band together to resist substantial changes to the bill , " @entity115 noted			2
" the central structure of this proposal is remarkably solid			0
" @entity115 , a close observer of the legislative maneuvering surrounding the bill , predicted that only a small fraction of amendments filed tuesday will actually be voted on by the panel			1
members " will hit a fatigue point , " he said			0
of all the amendments up for consideration , however , @entity14 's same - sex measures are likely to prove the most politically controversial			1
under @entity14 's sponsorship plan , modeled after his @entity138 , gays and lesbians requesting green cards for foreign - born partners would have to be married if their states currently recognize same - sex marriages			1
if their states do not recognize same - sex marriage , they would have to meet a series of requirements proving major emotional and financial commitments			1
the list of requirements could include , among other things , jointly owned property , shared child custody , joint bank accounts , joint credit cards , proof of a commitment ceremony and photographs of shared vacations and holidays with extended family			0
@entity164 sen. @entity163 , arguably the most prominent @entity11 member of the @entity74 , warned recently that @entity14 's proposal is a political poison pill that could undermine any hopes for passage of the broader bill			1
" this immigration bill is difficult enough as it is , " @entity163 told conservative radio talk show host @entity170 last month			2
" if you inject something like this in the bill , it will die			2
the coalition behind it will fall apart			0
" @entity163 , a potential presidential candidate , warned that he would withdraw his own support if @entity14 's amendment is added			0
" this is not the issue to engage this in , " he warned			0
" you will threaten the entire product			0
" @entity163 discussed immigration reform with more than two dozen conservative grassroots leaders in a closed - door meeting on @entity190 on tuesday , according to an aide to the senator			2
most of the activists are backing the reform effort , the aide said			0
@entity87 acknowledged tuesday that while he backs @entity14 's proposal , it could prove problematic for the larger immigration reform bill			1
" there are some problems on the @entity11 side when it comes to dealing with ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) issues , " @entity87 told @entity1			2
the @entity88 senator noted the possibility that the upcoming ruling by the @entity19 @entity210 on the @entity211 could render the whole issue moot			0
" the @entity211 ruling could change this whole debate , " @entity87 said			0
" they could eliminate @entity211 and impose obligations on our federal government ( relating to ) same gender marriage , and that would dramatically change what we 're trying to achieve			0
" @entity115 said @entity14 will ultimately " find the right way forward			0
" " the @entity11 - controlled @entity223 will never accept ( his same - sex amendment ) as part of their bill , " he said			1
@entity14 's " not going to tank this bill			0
" regardless , it is significantly easier for @entity14 to add the amendment to the bill while it is being considered by the @entity28			0
@entity75 hold a 10 - 8 majority on the panel , and can approve changes on a strict majority basis if necessary			0
in contrast , controversial amendments taken up by the full @entity3 are virtually certain to face a 60 - vote threshold			1
the @entity240 caucus only controls 55 seats in the 100 - member chamber			0
backers of the bill have been hoping to win as many as 70 votes in the @entity3 , in order to give the bill bipartisan momentum heading into the more skeptical , @entity42 - controlled @entity223			1
a bipartisan group of eight @entity223 members is currently working on its own immigration reform plan .			0
