it 's the name of a potentially lifesaving drug designed to reverse opioid prescription drug and heroin overdoses			1
in one case last month , a pair of @entity8 police officers put it to the test and saw it work			1
" we used the naloxone , we injected it into his nose , shortly ... after about 20 to 30 seconds , he ... started breathing and his eyes opened , " @entity13 officer @entity12 told @entity0			2
heroin - related deaths increased 84 % from 2010 to 2012 in @entity8 and involved 52 % of all overdose deaths in 2012 , according to the city 's @entity22 and @entity24			1
the problem is particularly bad on @entity26 , where the death rate from overdoses is almost three times higher than the rest of @entity8 , according to the agency			1
" i do think that every police officer should have it , " @entity12 said			0
as part of a pilot program launched in december , a group of @entity13 officers on @entity26 is armed with naloxone nasal spray and trained to use it at the sign of an overdose			1
" the pilot was selected for @entity26 where the mortality rate from overdose is 7.4 per 100,000 compared to 2.4 per 100,000 citywide , " @entity8 's @entity22 and @entity24 said in a news release thursday			1
@entity46 sees exploding heroin use this marks a greater push across the nation to get naloxone in the hands of first - line responders , emergency medical technicians and other overdose witnesses			1
that effort has gotten a lot more attention since the death of actor @entity60 , who overdosed on heroin on february 2			2
as of 2010 , naloxone was distributed in 15 states and the @entity63			2
notable cities and states that use it include @entity67 and @entity68 , and @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity8 , according to the @entity73			1
@entity1 distribution programs train potential overdose witnesses to correctly recognize an overdose and administer the drug , enabling bystanders to save more lives			1
" you need to have somebody else there to actually give the medication , " dr. @entity80 , @entity0 chief medical correspondent , said on " @entity81 " on tuesday			0
" the kit is a couple vial syringes , and it comes with instructions			0
" the @entity22 recommends administering naloxone directly to an individual overdosing after calling 911 and checking for breathing			2
the overdose antidote can be administered via needle or as a nasal spray			1
" the goal is get these in the hands of people who might potentially benefit from them , " @entity80 said			2
from 1996 to 2010 , more than 53,000 people were trained in naloxone administration and overdose response , and more than 10,000 lives have been saved because of overdose reversals , as reported by the @entity73 in 2012			1
@entity1 is funded by city and state health departments , which then distribute the antidote through hospitals and community - based programs at no cost , according to the @entity73			1
community - based programs include @entity112 's @entity111 and @entity70 ' @entity113 and @entity114			1
initiatives to expand the availability of naloxone are under way as the uptick in heroin use reverberates nationally			1
since 2012 , the @entity121 has publicly discussed making naloxone for over-the - counter use in hopes of reducing overdose fatalities			1
on tuesday , a new bill was introduced in the @entity127 to allow health care professionals to prescribe naloxone to a person at risk of experiencing an overdose , or to a family member , friend or other overdose witness			1
what is naloxone , and how does it work ? when someone takes heroin , the drug locks on to receptors in the brain , slows the body down and disrupts breathing , @entity80 said			1
@entity1 can rapidly free up those receptors and restore consciousness and normal breathing , essentially bringing the overdose victim back to life			2
more on just how heroin can turn you into a corpse first approved by the @entity121 in 1971 , naloxone has been used safely and effectively for more than 40 years in ambulances and emergency rooms across the country , according to the @entity152			1
every day in the @entity154 , 105 people die as a result of drug overdoses involving heroin or pharmaceutical opioids , according to the @entity73			2
with more than 30,000 deaths annually , accidental overdose has overtaken car accidents as our country 's leading cause of accidental death for people 25 to 64 , as reported by the @entity73			1
in @entity170 , @entity168 , a town of just 22,000 residents , three overdoses were reported in just 24 hours earlier this month			0
one of the overdoses resulted in a death , said capt. @entity173 of the @entity174			0
in january , at least 22 people in western @entity177 died after using heroin that had been mixed with fentanyl , a powerful narcotic used to treat cancer patients ' pain , @entity0 's @entity175 reported			1
the drug cocktails were being sold under harmless - sounding names , such as " @entity185 " and " @entity186			2
" at the start of the @entity190 , gov. @entity187 of @entity188 devoted his 2014 state of the state address to the state 's heroin problem , calling on law enforcement , medical personnel and @entity188 families " to take action before the quality of life that we cherish so much is compromised			2
" @entity202 - @entity201 on @entity26 was among the five @entity8 neighborhoods with the highest rate of heroin poisoning deaths from 2011 to 2012 , according to a @entity207 report from september 2013			1
" the problem is so mainstream			0
it knows no boundaries , " @entity212 told @entity0			0
he 's the executive director of the @entity215 residential rehabilitation program on @entity26 , which also sponsors rehab programs throughout @entity8 's five boroughs			1
so how did the problem rise to epidemic proportions ? these days , heroin is a cheaper alternative to opioids , according to the @entity8 @entity22			1
the nationwide crackdown on prescription pill abuse has made those drugs harder and more expensive to get			2
as a result , heroin has become a common substitute for prescription pills			0
@entity212 suggests this is the reason why heroin use has skyrocketed on @entity26			0
" it 's worse because the prescription opioid pill problem was worse -- so that morphs into heroin addiction , " @entity212 told @entity0			2
" in 2012 , doctors and law enforcement tightened up on doctor shopping and the availability of prescription drugs -- people moved to heroin			0
as early as 2012 , we saw a reduction in overdose deaths for prescription opioids , but the heroin overdose rate went up dramatically			1
" @entity212 says every five days , someone on @entity26 dies from an unintentional heroin overdose			1
one in 10 overdoses results in death , he says			0
" as they tighten up on the prescription drugs , the heroin marketers put out a product that is potent and inexpensive , " @entity212 said			0
" the person who is accustomed to getting opiate pills from friends , in a single - family house , are now strapping and putting in a hypodermic needle			0
" and the typical user group is not one you 'd expect , he says			0
" you have a high school tennis player , with a seriously hurt elbow or ankle -- and there you go , here 's 90 heroin tablets , good luck			2
" @entity212 says friends and family members of addicts should all have naloxone and be prepared to use it			0
" it 's not going to address the problem , but it will save some lives			1
" are users thinking about naloxone ? it 's difficult to determine whether users have considered naloxone as a fail - safe for continued drug abuse			1
but one addict in recovery says he never thought about the possibility of overdosing while using			0
" i mean , i knew about the naloxone , but i just did n't think overdose would happen to me -- so i was n't really too worried about it when i was using			2
" for a third time now , @entity290 , who asked not to share his last name , is in rehab for a heroin addiction that has ruled his life			0
he never stopped to think it could actually end his life			0
" i did n't think about overdosing			0
i wanted to get high , you know , any means to get it or do it , " the 22 - year - old told @entity0 as he reflected in the common room at the @entity215 residential rehab facility			0
@entity290 began using at 15			0
" i was using marijuana at first and then over time became curious about other things , and i started using prescription painkillers			0
i was using those for about two years , and then i had switched over to heroin because the pills were getting harder to find and very expensive -- and heroin was half the price and did the same job			0
@entity290 says he 'll fight to stay clean when he leaves rehab in the next three months			0
" i have a lot of goals that i set for myself that i would love to accomplish , and i want to see myself very successful when i get older			0
" if he can , he 'd like to go to college			0
he says he wishes more addicts had his opportunity to recover			0
