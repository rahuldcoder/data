-- it was a day of firsts at the @entity3 as @entity4 got a boost from technology and @entity7 and @entity8 scored a groundbreaking goal			1
and one of those " firsts " was a " last , " as @entity12 netted a winning goal deep into stoppage time , in what is reportedly the latest score in the opening round of the tournament			1
here are some of the highlights from sunday in @entity21 : getting on the board it took almost the entire contest , but @entity7 and @entity8 made sure its first @entity3 match did n't end up a shutout			1
@entity27 brought his homeland to within a goal of @entity30 with a score in the 84th minute at @entity33 's @entity32 , trickling a score past @entity36 goaltender @entity35			1
but it was too little , too late , as @entity30 held on for a 2 - 1 victory			2
we should mention that @entity27 was n't the first @entity7 to put the ball in the net			2
the problem is @entity43 knocked it into the wrong net , scoring an own goal just 3 minutes into the game			1
a hot @entity48 it turns out the deciding goal was @entity30 's second tally , by none other than @entity48 , arguably the world 's greatest ( and most scrutinized ) player , who has a history of underperforming in the @entity3			1
@entity48 scored a sublime goal in the 65th minute , on a give - and - go with @entity57 that led to a strong left foot off the inside of the post			1
the tally led to boos from @entity36 - hating @entity21 fans in @entity32 , exultation across @entity30 and @entity66 almost exploding			1
the @entity36 striker won the @entity68 and @entity69 crowns in 2009 , the combined @entity70 in 2010 - 2012 , and placed second in 2013 , while leading @entity71 to several major championships			2
but entering this year 's @entity3 , much of the focus lay on @entity48 's lack of goal scoring in the 2010 tournament , which ended with a 4 - 0 @entity36 loss to @entity78 in the quarterfinals			1
now that the pressure to score has abated , could this be the year @entity48 leads @entity30 to the title ? as late as it gets in 30 seconds , emotions for @entity84 went from exultation to heartbreak			2
defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory when @entity12 quickly counterattacked in the dying seconds after @entity90 brilliantly tackled @entity84 's @entity91 , who appeared certain to score in stoppage time			2
@entity90 began the @entity93 thrust upfield and was knocked to the ground , but the referee called for play to continue and @entity90 reclaimed the ball near midfield			0
the breakout ended when @entity100 met a @entity102 cross to knock home the breathtaking winner			0
@entity106 's 93rd minute goal was the latest anyone has ever scored in @entity3 group play , according to @entity109			1
and you have to hand it to @entity93 coach @entity112			0
he subbed in two guys			0
" it was a dream end to the game for us and is very important for the morale of the team , " he said			0
tech test sometimes soccer is a matter of inches			0
a player barely gets a toe on a ball to poke it away from an attacker			0
a player leaps high but just ca n't quite get to a cross			0
a shot hits the post and ends up barely over the goal line			1
the latter was the situation sunday when @entity4 's second goal in a 3 - 0 win over @entity137 barely leaked over the line			1
while the fans at the stadium watched replays and booed the referee 's call , new goal line technology showed it was indeed a goal			1
several television replays cast doubt on the call after @entity4 's @entity148 smoked a shot off the right post			0
the ball skittered across the face of the goal before diving @entity137 goalie @entity154 was judged to have nudged the shot fully over the line			1
only one of the replays showed the ball likely over the line , but on the screen , @entity69 's animated representation indicated it was a goal by a few inches			0
it was the first goal confirmed by goal line technology -- introduced at this @entity3 by @entity69			1
" that was straight out of a tennis match			0
well done @entity69 , " tweeted @entity167 , a forward who has played for the @entity169 national team , alluding to similar technology that helps tennis officials rule whether a ball was in or out of play			2
goals by the bunches there were only three goals scored in each of sunday 's first two matches			0
only ? while the number of goals per game had been trending down since the 1994 @entity3 held in the @entity169 , this tournament has seen an early explosion in the number of balls hitting the back of the net			2
after sunday 's action there have been 37 goals in 11 matches , 16 more than during the same number of games in @entity194 in 2010			0
( and that 's not counting two goals called back in the @entity199 - @entity198 match )			0
the tournament average of 3.4 goals would be the highest since 1958			0
ok , we should n't get ahead of ourselves ; there are 52 matches left .			0
