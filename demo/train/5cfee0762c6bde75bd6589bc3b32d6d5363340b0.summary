a @entity1 court has found former prime minister @entity2 guilty of abuse of authority for signing gas contracts with @entity6 and sentenced her tuesday to seven years in prison			1
authorities deployed hundreds of police officers around the court to keep order , state media reported			1
dozens of angry @entity2 supporters took to the streets of @entity15 in august when she was taken into custody			0
" dear friends , i just want to say that i disagree with this verdict and i am saying that the year 1937 is back again , " @entity2 said in the courtroom tuesday , making a reference to @entity21 's rule when @entity22 was part of the @entity24			1
but judge @entity27 said that " bearing in mind the fact that the court has not established any circumstances aggravating or mitigating @entity2 's punishment , and given the heightened social danger of the crime committed by @entity2 , her personality and the absence of any penitence on her part , the court sees no grounds to hand down a more lenient sentence			1
" in april , @entity22 's prosecutor general 's office opened a criminal case charging @entity2 with signing overpriced gas deals with @entity6 energy provider @entity46 that inflicted damages to the country of more than 1.5 billion hryvnas ( almost $ 190 million at the current exchange rate ) and which @entity2 had allegedly no right to sign			1
the court ruled @entity2 must repay the money , and she is banned from holding public office for three years			2
@entity2 narrowly lost to president @entity53 in a presidential election in february 2010 , and she became his fiercest opponent			0
@entity2 repeatedly brushed off all charges against her as political , calling the trial a " farce " and naming the judge a " stooge of @entity53 's administration , " appointed to " fabricate " the case			1
@entity6 prime minister @entity63 said tuesday he did n't understand why she was sentenced to seven years in the case			0
" it 's dangerous and counterproductive to question the complex of gas agreements reached between @entity22 and @entity6 in talks with @entity2 , " @entity63 was quoted as saying in @entity64 , according to state tv broadcaster @entity66			1
" gas contracts signed by @entity6 and @entity22 , after talks with @entity2 , fully comply with the laws of @entity6 , @entity22 and international standards			1
" the @entity74 said the nation 's 2009 natural gas agreements with @entity22 were legal			1
it says @entity6 " is committed to developing and deepening all - round partnership with @entity22 , including the search for mutually acceptable solutions in the gas sphere , as the leaders of the two countries agreed to in ( the @entity6 government country estate of ) @entity85 on september 24			2
" " one should take into consideration the fact that the leadership of many countries and the international community have perceived this court trial as one that was initiated for purely political reasons			0
by accusing @entity2 of abusing power when signing a contract for the supply of @entity6 gas in 2009 , the ... court ignored compelling evidence that those gas agreements were designed in strict accordance with the laws of @entity6 and @entity22 as well as the rules of international law , " it says			1
" we also see an obvious @entity110 implication in this issue			0
in actual fact , @entity2 was sentenced for the valid and legally - binding agreements in the gas area between ' @entity46 ' and ' @entity22 ' , " the ministry statement said			1
@entity116 slammed the verdict as " politically motivated " and called for the release of @entity2 , who was prime minister from january to september 2005 and december 2007 to march 2010			1
" the charges against her are not internationally recognizable offenses , they are attempts to criminalize decisions that she made in the course of her work , " said @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 deputy program director of @entity116			2
" poor political decisions of this kind -- if that is what they were -- should be punished by voters , not through courts			0
her conviction on these charges is illegitimate and she should be immediately released , " @entity120 said			0
" the trial against @entity2 highlights systemic problems within the justice system in @entity22 , and the conduct of this trial casts doubt over the independence of the judiciary			1
" @entity116 says she was charged in december " for abuse of office over the receipt of 180 million euros from the sale of a greenhouse gas quota to a @entity151 company			2
" it also says she is charged " with having delayed signing an order in december 2009 for the customs clearance of 1,000 @entity155 cars			0
the delay allegedly resulted in a budget loss of $ 4.6 million			0
" " @entity2 must be released and all charges against her must be dropped , " said @entity120			2
@entity160 foreign policy chief @entity159 said the organization " is deeply disappointed with the verdict " and it will prompt the @entity160 to " reflect on its policies towards @entity22			1
" she said the action points to the " politically motivated prosecutions " for " the leaders of the opposition and members of the former government			0
" " the way the @entity1 authorities will generally respect universal values and rule of law , and specifically how they will handle these cases , risks having profound implications for the @entity177 bilateral relationship , including for the conclusion of the @entity179 , our political dialogue and our cooperation more broadly			0
" @entity183 said the @entity160 calls for " competent @entity1 authorities to ensure a fair , transparent and impartial process in any appeal in the case of ms. @entity2 and in the other trials related to members of the former government " and says " the right of appeal should not be compromised by imposing limitations on the defendants ' ability to stand in future elections in @entity22 , including the parliamentary elections scheduled for next year			1
" the @entity1 foreign ministry said " internal processes " in the country must not affect forging the @entity179 with the @entity160			0
" any internal processes or passing events can not be a reason for refusal from such reciprocity [ on the question of @entity208 integration ] since we are talking about strategic prospects for the @entity160 - @entity1 relations , " the ministry said			2
disputes over energy prices have been the main sticking point in the relations between the @entity6 and @entity22 since the collapse of the @entity24 in 1991			0
@entity6 retained its vast oil and gas reserves , while the largest pipeline network to @entity121 -- the main customer of those energy riches -- ended up in @entity22 's territory			2
@entity22 is buying @entity6 gas for its domestic consumption and at the same time charges @entity6 transit fees for all its gas exports going west			1
in 2006 , the conflict was exacerbated when @entity6 cut off its supplies to @entity22 for not agreeing to pay what it was asking for gas , while the latter siphoned off @entity6 's gas deliveries to @entity121 to compensate for its own shortages			2
but three years later , the gas war reached a further unprecedented scale			0
for about two weeks of an unusually cold winter in @entity121 , most @entity208 customers were freezing , being cut off from @entity6 gas supplies as the two former @entity24 countries crossed horns in a commercial dispute and did n't want to yield to each other			0
and over the past few years , @entity6 has had much the same oil and gas disputes with its other western neighbor , @entity246			0
but @entity121 governments have repeatedly criticized @entity6 for its arm - twisting tactics against its less rich neighbors in economic matters and for using its vast energy resources as a weapon to impose its political will across the former @entity24 states , accusations that @entity6 denies .			0
