-- the scandal embroiling the empire of media mogul @entity5 's @entity4 might extend from @entity6 to @entity7 , legal experts not personally involved in the unfolding matter said monday			2
the potential liability flows from journalists at individual newspapers , such as the recently defunct @entity12 , to its parent , @entity4 , to its parent , @entity15 , which is a publicly held company in the @entity16			1
" the allegation so far with this phone hacking scandal includes a component where someone within @entity15 's organization perhaps made payments to @entity6 police officers to perhaps obtain information that would thus allow @entity12 to write newspapers and sell newspapers , " said @entity17 , a professor of business law at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
if true , that might violate the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) , which @entity17 described as " a @entity16 law that generally prohibits the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official for a business purpose			1
" so , there does seem to be a basis for a @entity16 investigation at this point			1
" if anyone at @entity15 participated in payments to police officers or authorized such payments or even knew about them and failed to stop them , the case could wind up in the lap of the @entity16 @entity52			1
the potential implications for the @entity5 media empire are numerous and none of them are good , @entity17 said			2
" many @entity33 enforcement actions have what i call ' a point of entry ' -- a set of limited , discrete facts that give rise to the inquiry in the first place			1
but it 's also very common for the ' where else ? ' question to be asked on the theory that , if @entity15 employees within the organization were making these payments to @entity6 police officers , perhaps others in this organization -- all over the world , for that matter -- were making similar payments			2
" the decision to close the @entity12 followed accusations that it illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims , politicians and celebrities , and claims it may have bribed police officers			2
police said last week that they had identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone - hacking			2
" there could be potential exposure , " concurred @entity88 , author of " @entity89 " and a partner with the @entity7 - based law firm of @entity92			1
the act stipulates that @entity16 - listed companies , their employees or agents may not make bribes to foreign officials			1
a second portion of the law applies to accounting requirements for public companies			1
" they have to keep books and records in reasonable detail that reflect the transactions , " @entity88 said			2
so , if a bribe was made and not properly noted , the @entity110 and the @entity52 could each have a case , he said			0
a telephone call or an e-mail from an editor in @entity6 to his or her boss in @entity117 could prove key , he said			0
" if you send an e-mail to the boss saying , ' i 'm going to pay $ 10,000 to police officers for this information , ' that would provide the jurisdictional basis or potential liability on the part part of possibly the @entity128 employees			2
" if any employee of @entity15 , which is listed in the @entity16 , knew about and authorized such a payment , " they could have potential exposure , " he said			1
and if @entity5 -- the 80 - year - old @entity135 - born head of @entity15 who became a @entity16 citizen in 1985 -- knew what was going on and authorized it -- even implicitly -- " he could have some potential exposure , " @entity88 said			1
the penalties can be severe , including jail time and fines , he said			0
ignorance confers no protection , he said			0
" the @entity110 has brought cases against @entity16 companies who had no knowledge of what foreign subsidiaries were doing , but had misbooked it , " he said , adding that the @entity110 blamed the companies for not having set up the internal controls that would have caught the illegal behavior			1
a @entity52 spokeswoman said she could not comment on possible @entity52 involvement			0
if the charges wind up being nothing more than civil accounting violations , the @entity110 would handle the case and @entity52 would not become involved , said @entity159 , coordinator of the @entity160 at @entity161 and @entity162 , a @entity7 - based law firm specializing in international regulatory issues , tax and litigation			1
that would still carry a major risk to those involved			0
" the @entity110 has a lot of bite in significant fines , penalties , prohibiting people from serving as officers in public companies , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview			0
" that can derail a career quickly			0
" but a criminal prosecution by @entity52 would be the most to fear , since it would carry the potential of jail time , he said			0
@entity110 fines can range up to $ 25 million per violation in such cases , but totals regularly exceed $ 100 million because the agency can force the company to disgorge ill - gotten gains			0
the @entity52 can impose a criminal fine on individuals of up to $ 100,000 and five years in prison for each count on a bribery charge , he said			0
multiple counts could lead to higher fines and sequential prison terms			0
but fines are typically pegged to how much a company or an individual gained as a result of the crime , he said			0
that can be easy to figure out when the subject is a contract , but any case involving @entity5 's empire might present more of a challenge			0
" how many more newspapers did you sell ? " he asked			0
still , @entity16 authorities may choose not to intervene at all			1
" if the @entity52 were satisfied that the @entity128 had sufficient ability to prosecute this , then they may step aside , " @entity159 said			0
" if they were n't satisfied , then they could be very interested			0
" @entity216 passed an aggressive law , the @entity218 , which became law on july 1 , but it is not retroactive , @entity159 said			2
the predecessor legislation that would apply " is a hodgepodge " of laws , some of which date back more than a century , he said			0
" that 's part of the problem			0
" still , as things now stand , the nearly 4,000 miles that separate @entity7 from @entity6 wo n't put off @entity16 investigators			1
" of the 10 largest fines in @entity33 history , eight have been against foreign companies , " @entity159 said			1
rep. @entity236 , @entity237 , has criticized the act as putting @entity16 companies at a competitive disadvantage and held hearings last month intended to water it down , @entity159 said			1
" the criticism is that it 's being overly enforced by @entity110 and @entity52 to reach activities that it should n't reach , " such as taking officials out for free meals , he said			2
a spokeswoman for @entity236 provided @entity0 with a statement monday from the congressman			0
" i plan to introduce a bill that would reform the @entity33 and bring it up - to - date with the changing world , " @entity236 said in the statement			1
" we need to bring clarity to what is and what is not illegal			0
my intent is to make sure that the stop signs and red lights are clearly visible for @entity16 companies doing commerce internationally			1
" right now , there is confusion regarding who qualifies as a foreign official			2
foreign law enforcement officers are clearly foreign officials and it is absolutely absurd to imply that any changes to the @entity33 would change that status or permit @entity16 businesses to bribe policemen , " he added .			1
