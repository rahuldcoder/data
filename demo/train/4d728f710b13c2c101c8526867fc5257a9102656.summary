-- a @entity2 woman will serve at least 14 years in prison after pleading guilty thursday to second - degree murder in the death last year of her 10 - year - old stepdaughter			1
as part of a plea agreement , @entity7 admitted killing @entity10 and attempting to thwart investigators by planting a fake ransom note at the family 's @entity13 , @entity2 , home in october 2010			2
@entity16 's body was dismembered and some of the remains were found a month later			0
the freckle - faced girl 's disappearance and search drew national attention			2
@entity16 had lost part of her left leg at age 5 and lost hearing in both her ears while undergoing treatment for cancer			0
dressed in a pink jail jumpsuit , @entity7 answered judge @entity31 's questions in a soft voice during her plea hearing thursday			1
@entity34 advised her that she will face between 14 years , nine months , and 18 years , six months in prison			1
@entity34 had already agreed to move @entity7 's murder trial out of @entity37 because of pretrial publicity in the case			1
the judge was supposed to announce monday where the trial would be held , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity43 , but that hearing was put on hold because of the pending plea deal			1
@entity7 also pleaded guilty to charges of obstruction of justice , bigamy , obtaining property by false pretenses and identity fraud			2
in the plea agreement she signed , and also under questioning thursday , @entity7 admitted to several aggravating factors in the case , including " a history and pattern of physical , verbal and psychological abuse of the victim			1
" moreover , @entity7 said she " secreted the victim from family and others " and " desecrated the victim 's body to hinder detection , " hampering the police investigation as a result			1
she also accepted statutory aggravating factors , namely that " the victim was very young , physically infirm or handicapped " and that " the defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence ... to commit the offense			0
" a call placed thursday to @entity7 's court - appointed attorney was not immediately returned			2
district attorney @entity79 , whose district includes @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity37 counties , told @entity0 he " absolutely " feels that justice was served , while adding that he wished " the law and the facts were more favorable to the state			0
" @entity79 said it was unexpected when @entity7 chose to cooperate with authorities on a case that caused " confusion and outrage and real frustration " in the @entity2 community			0
in a statement , he said that he agreed to the plea deal to avoid " the risk ... that @entity7 would avoid responsibility for her part in the death of @entity16			1
" " the probability was that without her cooperation , law enforcement would not locate @entity16 's body , " @entity79 said			0
" the probability of a successful prosecution for first - degree murder was likewise very unlikely			1
" the district attorney said he had consulted with @entity109 , the late girl 's biological mother who lives in @entity111			1
he said she was " pleased and satisfied " with the case 's conclusion			2
court documents in the case show that @entity7 told authorities @entity16 was killed two weeks before she was reported missing			0
authorities found the fake ransom note at the home			0
one criminal investigator testified at thursday 's hearing that @entity7 told authorities she found @entity16 not breathing on september 24 , 2010 , according to @entity43			0
investigations have no " credible evidence " to suggest that anyone other than @entity7 was involved in @entity16 's death , @entity79 said in february			0
@entity0 's @entity128 contributed to this report .			0
