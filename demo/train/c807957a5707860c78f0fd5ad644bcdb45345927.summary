-- at @entity2 's previous job as a project engineer for one of the country 's top construction firms , visible tattoos for professional staff were against company policy			1
@entity11 's former employer told her that she had to conceal her tattoos while at work			1
she found this ironic -- not to mention frustrating -- given that her position entailed inspecting job sites filled with tattooed construction workers			1
" i was out on site all day , and i was n't allowed to show any of my tattoos , " says the 28 - year - old @entity19 native , whose six large tattoos on her arms and back include a brightly colored sunflower , a marigold and a rendition of a @entity26 bride and groom on her upper left arm			0
" ninety - eight degrees and long sleeves is not so cool when you 're in @entity34			0
" after six years with the construction firm , @entity2 decided to move north and find an employer that would n't needle her about her body art. she found her " perfect job " in @entity38 , @entity39 , as a project manager at a design and branding agency			2
now , " i have no problem showing up to meet a big client in a t - shirt and jeans , " tattoos in plain view , she says			0
" i wish more companies were like this			2
" ireport.com : share your tattoo stories the times , they are not a-changing ? according to a 2006 report in the @entity58 , 24 percent of @entity60 ages 18 to 50 have at least one tattoo , and 14 percent have at least one body piercing			1
researchers questioned 253 women and 247 men via random telephone survey			0
so , does the fact that body art is as prevalent today as mullets were in the 1980s mean that the tattoo - friendly tide is turning in the workplace ? " that question is best answered by [ corporate ] culture and by industry , " says @entity73 , director of human resources in the @entity76 office of accounting giant @entity77			1
" if you look at a company like @entity84 , a very entrepreneurial , @entity85 organization , tattoos are more acceptable			2
" " but if you look at the other end of the spectrum , which is where i happen to [ work ] , " says the 20 - year human resources veteran , " the answer is absolutely not			0
if you have six piercings and a big tattoo , we 're going to tell you to cover the tattoos and take out the piercings			2
" ( for the record , a @entity84 spokesperson said that the company does not have a policy on tattoos			1
) @entity105 , a dermatologist from @entity106 , @entity107 and a co-author of the @entity58 study , is n't surprised that a few companies or industries are still opposed to body art. " eight percent of people with tattoos report trouble at work , " from being forced to hide them to being restricted from performing certain tasks , @entity113 says			1
for example , a grocery store employee with a tattoo on their hand might be asked to perform tasks less likely to bring them into contact with the public , like stocking shelves instead of working a register			2
better safe than cited what 's the solution for body art aficionados who work in one of the more conservative business sectors ? hide your body art or starve ? pretty much , says @entity138 , who photographed 15 professionals with large - scale tattoos they conceal at work for the book " @entity143 " and runs @entity144 , a related web site			1
" i think in some ways , it 's a ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' understanding , " says the 37 - year - old @entity150 lawyer , who works as general counsel for a venture capital firm			2
" there 's kind of this @entity155 element to it , like this crazy blue and red skin - tight suit underneath my @entity159 exterior			0
" like many of the secretly inked doctors , lawyers , and architects he 's met over the years , @entity138 sticks to tattoos he can easily conceal under clothing at work -- in his case , three - quarter " ink sleeves " that extend from each shoulder to the middle of his forearms but allow him to roll up his shirt sleeves on warm days			1
and while the ink 's out of the bag now that @entity138 's published his book , he still keeps his tats under wraps for fear of them being " a distraction in the workplace			0
" the same goes for @entity183 , a public relations specialist at a @entity186 law firm			0
to commemorate turning 25 and getting her mba this year , she got a small omega symbol tattooed at the base of her neck in ultraviolet ink , which can only be seen with a black light			0
" no one knows about it unless i show them , " she says			0
" i have to bring the black light out from my high school years			0
" where the body art roams but what if you 're not a doctor , lawyer , or accountant , but a creative type determined to find a job where you can bare your body ink ? that 's when it 's time to play detective , says career coach @entity213			1
" visit the employee parking lot to see how they are dressed and whether many of the employees have visible tattoos , " says the psychologist and founder of @entity221 , a career counseling firm in @entity223			1
" also ask colleagues and friends if they know anyone who works there who can give you some insider info			0
" " the web is also a gold mine of information , " she says , adding that the web site @entity231 , which is dedicated to body art and other modifications , features a database of companies reportedly open to tattoos			1
then again , if a no - tattoo policy is your deal breaker , you could take a gamble like @entity2 did during the interview for her current position : " i said , ' are you tattoo friendly ? ' " fortunately , the answer was yes			1
