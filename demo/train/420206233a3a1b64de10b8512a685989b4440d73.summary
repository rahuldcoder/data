the official said friday that the @entity11 has an understanding with @entity9 leadership on the issue , and , " we believe it will stop where it is			1
" the measure passed 23 - 22 in the @entity19 on thursday			2
in response , @entity6 ordered its ambassador to the @entity3 home for " consultation , " @entity21 spokesman @entity20 told @entity1			1

" and it is wrong			0
the substance is also wrong			0

" " i do n't pretend to be a professional historian , " @entity19 chairman @entity144 , @entity145 , said ahead of thursday 's vote			0
" but the vast majority of experts ... agree that the tragic massacres of the @entity5 constitute genocide			2
" rep. @entity152 , @entity154 - @entity153 , acknowledged that @entity6 is an " important , strong [ and ] necessary ally of the @entity3			1
" but " overriding all of that , " he said , " is the issue of justice and the issue of history			0
... history has to be righted			0
" opponents of the resolution had expressed sympathy toward the victims of the 1915 killings , but said current political concerns took priority			1
rep. @entity169 , @entity170 , praised the committee 's " sincere effort " to illuminate " a dark chapter in history , " but said the committee should not pass the measure			0
" i do not minimize the horror that took place , " he said			0
but " now is not the time for this committee of the @entity27 to take up the measure that is now before us			0
" @entity6 is a strategic partner of @entity3 efforts in @entity185 and @entity186 , he said			1
furthermore , the logistical support provided by the @entity3 base in @entity189 , @entity6 , is a " staple " of @entity3 power in the @entity192 , he asserted			1
" in a time of war , " the @entity3 should not " take the relationship [ with @entity6 ] for granted			1
" rep. @entity196 , @entity197 , argued that @entity27 should not do anything to undermine the @entity37 government , which is a " secular alternative model for the @entity122 world			0
" " i hate this vote , " he said			0
" the @entity3 has a great deal at stake in the @entity37 relationship			2
" @entity27 should n't " pontificate on this issue " and then pretend " there will be no consequences , " he warned			0
last year , the foreign ministers of @entity6 and @entity41 signed a series of protocols aimed at establishing embassies in @entity121 and @entity138			1
the @entity3 - , @entity214 - and @entity215 - backed agreement also called for the creation of an international committee of historians to examine archives and " restore mutual confidence between the two nations			2
