former @entity2 assistant football coach @entity1 routinely had a then - teenage boy perform oral sex on him while the two showered together on the school 's campus and elsewhere , the alleged victim testified monday			1
" it would have to be 40 times , at least , " said the now 28 - year - old man , adding that the abuse started when he was 14			0
known in court documents as @entity13 , he was the first person to testify at @entity1 's trial in @entity15			2
the @entity17 ' longtime defensive coordinator faces 52 charges tied to what prosecutors say was his systemic abuse of at least 10 boys over a span of 15 years			0
the 68 - year - old defendant was under house arrest prior to his trial , which is expected to continue for about three weeks			0
like many alleged victims , the man on the stand monday met @entity1 through @entity30 , the nonprofit group the ex-coach founded			1
he described growing up without parental oversight before @entity1 took to him -- playings sports with him ; paying for uniforms , a snowboard and other items , taking him to @entity2 games and doing other special things			1
victim 4 said @entity1 also drove him to buy marijuana once when he was 15 or 16 , and had bought him cartons of cigarettes			1
despite what he described as systemic sexual abuse by @entity1 , the witness said he was " scared " and reluctant to tell anyone about it , including peers who admired him for seemingly being well connected with @entity2 's football program			1
" i did n't want to lose the good things i had , " he said			0
" i kind of looked at @entity1 as a father figure , and he was nice to me except for those other instances ... and i feel cool ( because ) i 'm getting nice things out of it			2
" victim 4 said he initially refused to talk to police after reports surfaced @entity1 was being investigated , adding the grand jury was the first to hear his full story			1
" i 've spent so many years burying this in the back of my head ... but then i found out this happened over and over and over again , forever , " he testified			0
" and i feel if i had just said something back then , this would n't have happened to ( others )			0
" while @entity1 said he wanted him to succeed and was nice to him in public , victim 4 says their relationship was different in private			1
" he treated me like a son in front of other people			2
outside of that , he 's treating me like his girlfriend , " he said , noting @entity1 's habit of putting his hand on the then - teen 's thighs when they drove in a car together			1
all about the allegations , how case unraveled besides the alleged oral sex , victim 4 detailed other instances of alleged abuse , including @entity1 trying to penetrate him in the shower , caressing him and " kissing ... my thighs			1
" this allegedly took place in athletic buildings on @entity2 's campus , as well as the @entity96 and hotels -- including on trips to @entity99 and @entity100 to watch the @entity17 play at the @entity101 and @entity102 , respectively -- victim 4 testified			1
he described staying in a hotel with @entity1 and his wife on the road to attend one such bowl game , and being in the bathroom getting ready to take a shower when @entity1 walked in			2
" he came in and was basically doing the caressing on me , ... and then started to push down on me , to motion me to go down there , " the witness testified			0
" and he said , ' you do n't want to go back to @entity115 , do you ? " referring to the @entity15 community where the then - teenager was living			0
this incident ended , victim 4 testified , when @entity1 's wife called out , " @entity1 , ... what are you doing in there ? " at which point the alleged victim said he " jumped in the shower and locked the door			1
" jurors were shown excerpts of letters victim 4 said @entity1 wrote to him			1
in one , he writes , " i know that i have made my share of mistakes			0
... my wish is that you care and have love in your heart			0
it bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things			0
" defense attorneys had filed a motion earlier monday seeking to keep out testimony involving prosecutors ' allegations @entity1 exhibited " grooming behavior , " including the letters to victim 4			1
the lawyers said they intend to offer expert testimony from a psychologist who " will explain that the words , tones , requests and statements made in the letters are consistent with a person who suffers from a @entity158 , " according to documents			0
according to the @entity160 , those with histrionic personality disorder " act in a very emotional and dramatic way that draws attention to themselves			0
" " the goal of a person suffering from this disorder in writing those letters would not necessarily be to groom or sexually consummate a relationship in a criminal manner , but rather to satisfy the needs of a psyche belabored by the needs of such a disorder , " the defense lawyers write in their motion			2
in opening statements , defense lawyer @entity179 suggested his client would take the stand			2
@entity1 would admit , he said , that he routinely " got showers with kids " after working out			2
@entity1 has always maintained his innocence , @entity179 said , claiming his client 's alleged victims had changed their stories and were questioned until authorities received the answers they wanted			1
" a lot of people lied , " @entity179 said			0
some of the alleged victims have civil attorneys , he noted , calling that unusual			1
others , he said , have a financial interest in the case			0
" one of the keys to this case , one of the keys to your perception ... is to wait until all the evidence is in , " @entity179 told jurors			0
" some of it will be graphic ... it 's going to be awful			2
but that does n't make it true			0
" however , he said @entity211 , a former graduate student who said he saw what appeared to be @entity1 sexually assaulting a boy in a shower in @entity2 's athletic facilities in 2002 , did not necessarily lie			1
@entity211 has said he assumed sex was occurring even though he did not see the actual act , @entity179 said			0
@entity218 , an attorney for @entity219 , told reporters later that his client had no financial interest and " never sought this out , " but considers it " an obligation of citizenship " to testify			0
and @entity226 said he 's never talked with his lawyer -- whom he said he has n't paid " a dime " -- about being part of any civil lawsuit against @entity1			1
@entity179 told jurors former @entity30 children will testify that @entity1 affected their lives in a positive way , and he later showed letters to victim 4 in which the ex-coach wrote " i 'm proud of you and really care			1
" the defense lawyer also questioned some alleged victims ' behavior , like the one who went to a football game with @entity1 prior to his arrest			1
victim 4 brought his girlfriend and baby over to meet @entity1 " like he was bringing his family to meet his father , " said the lawyer			1
the alleged victim admitted monday to visiting @entity1 about two years ago , so his girlfriend -- who was suspicious about the past between the two -- " could see that everything was normal			1
" " but that backfired because the whole time we were there , ( @entity1 ) only wanted to be with me and was sort of rubbing my shoulders			2
so ( my girlfriend ) knew , " he testified			2
the prosecution presented its opening statements first , during which childhood pictures of eight of the 10 alleged victims were shown on a projector screen			1
prosecutor @entity269 described the extent of each victim 's contact with @entity1			1
" you 'll hear about systematic behavior by a serial predator			0
these were experiences that took place not over days , not over weeks , not over months ... but over years , " @entity269 said			0
feelings of humiliation , shame and fear led to " years of silence " on the part of accusers , the prosecutor said			0
he reminded jurors that @entity1 , not @entity30 or @entity2 , was on trial			1
but , @entity269 said , @entity30 represented " the perfect environment for a serial predator			0
" in interviews after his arrest , @entity1 acknowledged showering and " horsing around " with boys , but denied being sexually attracted to them			2
@entity269 referred to those interviews during his opening statement , saying , " deny what you can ... and make an excuse			0
" a jury of five men and seven women , along with four alternates , was selected last week			0
half of the 16 jurors and alternates have ties to @entity2 , including one retired professor and one current professor , three graduates , two employees and one current student , showing the prominence of the university in the local community			2
the case has raised questions about @entity2 's response to allegations , with some claiming the school put its reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims			1
university president @entity323 and iconic head football coach @entity324 lost their jobs soon after @entity1 's arrest amid criticism they did n't handle the matter appropriately			2
@entity324 died of complications from lung cancer in january			0
opinion : @entity1 's got a jury of his peers -- @entity335 @entity211 , the former graduate student who became a coach , is considered a key witness			2
he said he alerted @entity324 in 2002 that he 'd seen what appeared to be @entity1 sexually assaulting a boy , an allegation authorities did n't learn of until years later			2
@entity324 apparently told athletic director @entity341 , but no one notified police			0
@entity341 and @entity344 , @entity2 's senior vice president for finance and business , are now facing felony charges of perjury and failing to report the allegations to authorities			1
both of them pleaded not guilty			0
on monday , defense attorneys requested that the grand jury testimony of @entity341 , @entity354 and @entity323 be admitted into evidence , saying they anticipate the three would invoke their @entity357 right against self - incrimination if called to testify			0
the defense also asked that if prosecutors attempt to enter portions of @entity1 's autobiography , " touched , " into evidence , the entire text be admitted			1
defense attorneys said they fear prosecutors may use " select snippets " to mischaracterize @entity1 's " motivations , purposes and actions			1

victim 4 says @entity1 treated him " like his girlfriend " in private
he says he 's never paid his lawyer or talked about joining a civil lawsuit
he describes alleged assaults on @entity2 's campus , in hotels and elsewhere
the defense questions the motives of the alleged victims
