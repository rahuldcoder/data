gold medals are the pinnacle of achievement for the 26 @entity4 sports contested at the @entity5			1
athletes get one shot every four years to make history : but time , dedication , guile and application must combine for the opportunity to be seized			0
sometimes , however , even this is not enough to be crowned the world 's best			0
visualize running the race of your life as part of a four - man relay team , being acknowledged as winners to the world but never receiving the coveted medallion of precious medal			1
imagine this happened 12 years ago to a team from a nation that has only ever won two gold medals previously and that , despite the official nature of the result , the wait goes on			1
picture that in the intervening time , between the event and the present day , you have buried one of your teammates , a man who died at the age of 42 without ever touching the gold he rightfully won			1
this is the story of @entity41 's 4 x 400m runner @entity40			1
@entity40 was born in @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity41 and ran the 400m in 45.16 at his prime at the 1995 @entity46 in @entity47			1
his talent was so prodigious as a youth he won a scholarship to train and study in the @entity52 at the @entity53 and , after an injury - plagued experience at the @entity55 of 1996 , then qualified to run for his nation again at @entity57			1
and it was in @entity59 that @entity40 , running in the @entity41 relay team of @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , reached his zenith of performance on the track			1
the greatest " that relay team was the greatest , " @entity40 , 38 , told @entity67 , at " @entity68 " a theater close to the @entity70 in @entity71 , themed in all things west @entity73 for the duration of the @entity5			1
" previously there had always been a weak member in the relay team , but when myself and @entity61 joined sunday , and then @entity80 came into the side , we knew we were strong			1
we knew something special could happen			0
" the tale of @entity41 's only gold medal in the 4 x 400m is one as packed with drama as it is delays			1
going into the race , the @entity41 had reason to feel pleased with their performance so far			2
for a nation that had never won a medal in the 400m -- its two other golds came from football and long jump in 1996 -- the team won their semifinal to book a place in lane four			1
in lane five , the outright favorites , @entity101 : @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 and anchored by one of @entity52 's greatest ever sprinters @entity108 , who had already taken gold in the individual 400m			1
@entity40 would race the second leg against @entity103			2
" on the day of the final , i woke up feeling relaxed and thought ' i feel good , let 's see what happens			0
' all the attention from our sports ministry was on the women 's team , they were thought to be the big medal hope , nobody really paid attention to us			2
" and we only got the fifth fastest time in the semifinals , remember , but we had trust in ourselves			0
we knew we could deliver			0
" @entity41 were in fifth when @entity40 clasped the baton for the second leg			2
by the final meter , @entity63 had dipped his head into second place with an overall time of 2:58.68			0
" it was the race of our lives , " @entity40 told @entity67			0
" it 's the best 4 x 400m i ever ran , and we still hold the @entity73 record			1
" while the runners from the most populous nation in @entity73 beat @entity139 to second , the @entity52 topped the podium and had gold medals draped around their necks , a crowning glory for the team and @entity108 -- a winner in the individual 200m and 400m in @entity147 -- in particular.but the golds would have a restless destiny			1
dope and displaced gold in 2004 the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) ruled that @entity152 , an @entity52 sprinter who ran for the @entity52 in the 4 x 400 semifinal , had been ineligible to compete , a decision that would see the medals taken from the quartet and the result erased from the record books			1
under appeal , the @entity159 ( @entity159 ) overturned the ruling and allowed the @entity101 to keep their medals , but not for long			2
for in may 2008 , in the trial of former running coach @entity164 , @entity103 testified he had used performance enhancing drugs ( @entity166 and human growth hormone ) under @entity164 's tutelage during the @entity169			1
@entity164 was subsequently sentenced to one - year 's house arrest for perjury while @entity103 suffered a two - year ban from competition			2
in the wake of the admission both @entity103 and @entity108 returned their gold medals voluntarily to the @entity178 in june of that year , before the @entity178 confirmed the @entity52 abrogation			1
their decision came within a whisker of breaching the " statute limitations " of 8 years , after which there is no legal basis for retrospective change to such results			0
" for eight years i could say i was a five - time olympic gold medalist			0
then i had to start saying four - time			0
it does n't sound the same , " an angry @entity108 told @entity191 newspaper @entity190 in july , 2012			0
@entity103 committed suicide in 2010			2
the golds were no longer in the possession of the @entity101 runners , but they still were far from the @entity41 ' grasp			1
the long wait ... four more years passed -- while the @entity178 waited to see if any further information would surface from @entity52 doping investigations -- before the body 's executive board to award the gold medals to the west africans			1
on july 20 , 2012 as the @entity178 convened ahead of the @entity203 , @entity41 were proclaimed gold medal winners of the @entity57 ' 4x400m relay			1
sadly , the decision came too late for @entity62 , who died suddenly , of a suspected cardiac arrest , in december 2011 , after collapsing at the @entity208 in @entity209			1
" the day before he died i called him to talk about the medals , so it 's sad we 've lost him			2
the @entity178 should have made this a priority , it 's very frustrating , " @entity40 said			0
" it was sad we did n't get to hear the @entity41 national anthem during the @entity4 , but especially for my friend sunday			2
he 's not here to get the medal			0
that in itself is sad			0
" according to @entity40 , the three remaining athletes are still unaware of how and when the medals will be given to them			2
" i 'm disappointed in the @entity178 and the @entity226 ( @entity226 )			0
i spoke to the @entity41 sports minister last week and he said to me ' @entity228 , when are you getting your gold medal ? ' i said ' sir , you 're asking me ? ' i 've heard nothing since			2
" it would have been nice to get our medals in the stadium in @entity71 , but i 'm not sure this has happened in the @entity4 before			0
this is very rare , so there is no protocol			0
" in response the @entity178 told @entity67 in a statement : " the presentation of the medals falls under the remit of the @entity226 , we suggest that you contact the @entity226 directly for further details			0
" when @entity67 did , @entity248 -- the secretary general of the @entity226 said : " we can not respond to the questions raised at this time			0
" though doubt remains over when @entity40 , @entity63 and @entity61 will receive their coveted prize , the meaning it will have to those involved and a nation of avid athletics fans does not			0
" @entity41 loves the @entity4 especially track and field , it would mean so much for the country			0
the medal could now be dedicated to @entity62 and we 're hoping his son could pick up the medal for him instead			0

@entity41 's 4 x 400m team were awarded *victory* when @entity101 's gold was rescinded
@entity103 , of @entity101 , admitted doping during the @entity57 in 2008
the @entity41 athletes have still yet to be given their gold medals won in 2000
former 400m runner and member of @entity41 relay team @entity62 died in 2011
