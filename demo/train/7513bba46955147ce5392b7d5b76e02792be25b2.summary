-- on an island chain located halfway between @entity3 and @entity4 , local authorities say a massive penguin rescue operation is under way			1
a mix of island officials and resident volunteers are struggling to save tens of thousands of @entity11 penguins threatened by an oil spill in the remote stretches of the south @entity14 , roughly 1,500 miles west of @entity15 , @entity3			1
the islands ' conservation director said at least 300 penguins have died after a cargo ship leaked thousands of tons of heavy oil , diesel fuel and soya bean near @entity24 , a @entity26 territory part of the @entity28 archipelago			1
" i 've seen about 15 to 20 dead penguins just today , " director @entity29 said			2
thousands more are covered in the ships ' oil and diesel fuel , according to local officials and conservationists			1
" the danger now is getting the rest of these penguins past that oil slick , " @entity29 said			1
the rescue operation began shortly after march 16 , when the @entity41 -- a @entity43 - registered ship -- ran aground , fracturing its hull and ultimately splitting the vessel in two			0
the ship was heading from @entity46 , @entity47 , to @entity48 and had been carrying 60,000 metric tons of soya beans and 1,500 metric tons of heavy fuel , according to islands ' administrator @entity51 and @entity53 , the @entity43 shipping authority			0
the agency said in a statement that it " is investigating the grounding and subsequent complete hull failure " of the bulk carrier cargo ship			0
the dramatic rescue of the ship 's 22 crew members was captured on video , along with the spills ' aftermath , which showed penguins soaked in heavy oil			1
it was shot by an expedition team from an eco-tourism ship -- whose crew used inflatable boats to help ferry the sailors to safety , according to @entity76 of the @entity78 - based @entity77			0
@entity76 witnessed the rescue aboard the vessel , called the @entity81 since then , an oil sheen has surrounded the island chain , which officials say could lead to an environmental disaster			1
rescue workers , using inflatable watercraft and fishing vessels , are now ferrying penguins to a series of makeshift rehabilitation centers at the main island of @entity28 , according to @entity29			1
there , he added , conservationists and volunteers are working in an effort to nurse the blackened penguins back to health			2
" we need help , " said @entity100 , a spokeswoman for the @entity101 who is also apart of the ongoing rescue effort			0
" the priority is to get food into the birds as they are very hungry , " she said			0
" we are trying locally caught fish and some are starting to take small half - inch squares of the food			0
" @entity100 noted that some of the islands ' residents had emptied their personal freezers in an effort to help feed the animals			0
by friday , @entity29 said his team had corralled and transported a total of nearly 5,000 penguins , despite harsh winds and high seas that had hampered earlier rescue attempts			2
but the timing of their task is daunting			0
the shipwreck , having occurred at the end of the birds ' molting season -- a period during which penguins shed their feathers , do not eat and largely stay out of the water -- left the birds " at their weakest possible state , " @entity76 explained			2
" they 're very hungry			0
" the season 's end also marks the beginning of a period when penguins re-enter the sea , now laden with heavy oil and soya beans			2
in a written statement , @entity146 administrator @entity51 said it is unclear what the impact of the ship 's cargo will have on the local marine environment , particularly " any long - term effect on the economically valuable fishing industry for crawfish , crayfish or @entity158 ... which is the mainstay of @entity28 's economy			0
" fewer than 300 people live on the island chain , eclipsed by the its massive penguin population -- estimated at 150,000 -- which accounts for roughly 40 percent of the world 's total , according to the @entity166 , a global network of conservationists			1
the @entity11 penguin had been listed as " one of the world 's most threatened species of penguin , " according to the @entity101 .			1
