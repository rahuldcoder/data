@entity1 , @entity0 -- my first memory of anything to do with a @entity7 presidential election lurks in the mists of my @entity1 childhood			1
it was a warm june evening			0
my mother had taken me for a walk around the ancient stadium where the first modern - era olympics were staged in 1896			0
suddenly i saw her eyes fill with tears after hearing a newsboy screaming , at the top of his voice , that someone called @entity22 was dead			0
it was 1968 , a year into the dark ages of our military dictatorship			0
i still recall her explanation of those tears : " he was our last chance , " she lamented			0
when in the months and years that followed members of my family were arrested by the secret police , when the streets of @entity1 caught fire following the student uprising of 1973 , when , indeed , war broke out over @entity40 in 1974 , it was not hard to imagine that our calamities must have had something to do with the fact that three well aimed bullets had kept a good man out of the @entity46			0
@entity48 postcard : @entity49 walks fine line it was 1976 again when a @entity7 presidential campaign snuck into my then - teenage imagination			2
i recall my schoolmaster 's enthusiasm for a certain mr. @entity56 -- who would , in his estimation , put human rights on the map , impose an arms embargo on @entity62 and , thus , reward the recently re-democratised @entity0 with the bargaining power it craved so as to reverse @entity40 ' occupation , and thus liberate us @entity0 from the need to spend an unseemly portion of our national income on defence			1
while the embargo was indeed introduced , it was not long before my schoolmaster and every other @entity0 i knew were deeply disappointed by the president from @entity75			2
looking back , every @entity7 election of that past few decades incited expectations amongst my fellow @entity0 that were , quite quickly , dashed -- although this was more a reflection of our unrealistic expectations than on anything that occurred in @entity84			1
thankfully , this pattern seems to have been broken			0
today , no one i know casts a longing eye on the @entity46			0
even though @entity0 is needier than it has been for a long while , @entity0 are not looking to @entity84 for rays of hope			2
@entity92 postcard : should @entity7 raise fist to @entity94 ? if anything , @entity0 public opinion is wary of what might happen after the election is over , fearful that @entity99 and the @entity100 may be delaying any attempt to amputate @entity0 from the eurozone until after the political dust has settled in the @entity7			1
my hunch is that @entity0 have the impression that @entity7 no longer has either the interest or the capacity to influence our modus vivendi			1
they saw the contempt with which the inane @entity112 finance ministers treated @entity113 , the @entity7 treasury secretary , in the fall of 2011 , when he visited them in @entity116 to impart advice on how to address the euro crisis			1
from this and other sad incidents , @entity0 have surmised that the @entity7 no longer holds sway over our @entity112 destiny ; at least not the way it used to			1
@entity125 postcard : why @entity126 longs for @entity7 election where once we would intensely study every little sign coming from @entity84 for clues of what might befall or grace us , now the @entity0 antennae are trained anxiously toward @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			1
while these lines are being written , my wife and i are preparing for our move to @entity7 ; in effect , postmodern refugees from our hideous crisis			2
a job offer as chief economist for a video game company , and a visiting professorship at @entity147 , at @entity148 , plus an opportunity for my artist wife to work and exhibit in the @entity152 , offered us escape pods from the misery of @entity0 , indeed from @entity112 's inanity			1
as we prepare , our friends , strangers who stop me in the street , waiters in restaurants , everyone asks us about @entity7			2
and most have something to say about the presidential election			0
the @entity0 i speak to would rather mr. @entity164 won			0
but they do not fear a @entity49 administration			0
interestingly , they tend to think of the @entity7 as a country which , powerful as it may still be , is just as impotent in the face of the forces of global recession as we are			2
more : get latest updates at @entity2 's @entity173 and here lies the difference from the past : @entity1 exhibit a new and unexpected form of national unity when discussing the @entity7 election ! whereas in the past we were divided between @entity181 and @entity182 , between pro- and @entity184 , nowadays @entity7 is being seen by almost everyone here as a kindred spirit ; a nation that understands what the @entity0 , the @entity188 , the @entity189 etc. are going through in the hands of a @entity99 - dominated austerian @entity112 ; a continent that has lost its way			1
@entity0 even seem to have developed a sophisticated feel about the divisions within the @entity7 , between those struggling in the current recessionary climate and the notorious 1 % who have never had it so good			1
and they can map these divisions onto the divisions that are burgeoning in @entity112 between the " core " and the ' " periphery			0
" paradoxically , it may be that the crash of 2008 simultaneously robbed @entity7 of much of its global authority and endowed my fellow @entity0 with a better feel of the @entity7 ' struggle to keep democracy alive in troubled economic times .			1

*greeks* believe @entity7 has no sway over @entity112 's economic crisis , says @entity214
many are worried the @entity100 could plan to kick @entity0 out of euro after @entity7 election
