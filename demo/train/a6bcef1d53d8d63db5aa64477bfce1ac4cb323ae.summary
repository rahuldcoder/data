-- let me just start by saying this : redemption , political or otherwise , is a good thing			2
and by and large , voters are amenable to proffering forgiveness -- especially when they believe the candidate is making a good - faith effort to reform , atone and emerge as a chastened and wiser person			0
and so it was with @entity10 , the erstwhile sexter who left @entity11 in disgrace two years ago to work on his problem , his life and his marriage			1
at least that 's what we thought he was doing , until we learned this week that -- one full year after he resigned from @entity11 -- he was still sending explicit text messages to a young woman			1
@entity22 react to @entity10 's scandal we do n't know the full story , and honestly , it 's hard to say whether we ever will , or how much we should care			1
but here is what we do know , and this does matter : that @entity10 is running for mayor of @entity22 , and that in preparing us for his candidacy in april , he cleverly alluded to the fact that there were more texts with other women			1
" i did it , with more than one person , " he said			0
i was doing it for some time , and i 'm glad it 's behind me			2
" what we did n't know was it was n't that far behind him			0
in @entity10 's efforts to inoculate himself against further women coming out , he left the timing of his inappropriate behavior vague			1
he knew that most of us would assume that , once he resigned from @entity11 in disgrace , he was fully involved in recovery , trying to regain his identity			2
an @entity10 timeline instead , he was masquerading as @entity52			1
and he was trolling as this bon vivant at least a full year after he left office			2
so while he has been making the case that his family 's love , support -- and therapy -- has gotten him to a good place , he kind of forgot to tell us one key fact : his sexual misconduct did not end with his resignation from office			0
silly us for assuming that ? or silly us for allowing him to let us believe that ? all of which begs the question : why believe him now ? enter @entity70 , his smart , savvy , politically connected ( especially to the @entity72 ) wife			0
it was breathtaking to see her tuesday next to @entity10			2
not only standing beside him as @entity74 but also speaking directly to voters			0
" i have forgiven him , " she told us			0
" i believe in him			0
" indeed , she said , the decision to keep the marriage together " took a lot of work " and " a whole lot of therapy			0
" opinion : why does @entity70 put up with @entity10 ? i am sure it did , and we should respect her decision -- both to stand by her man and to speak			2
but here 's one question : is running for mayor a required part of couples therapy ? this should be a private matter			1
but once @entity10 threw his hat in the ring , asking for redemption , it became a lot less private			1
the couple participated in a very orchestrated pr rollout -- with interviews in the @entity108 and @entity109 magazine , discussing their personally difficult journey			0
and we seem to be on it with them , like it or not			0
@entity10 's problem is not just about his personal compulsions			1
it 's also about his inability to tell the complete truth to the people he is asking to redeem and forgive him			1
when he was first caught in the sexting scandal , it took him what seemed like forever to fess up -- after lying , and saying he had been hacked			0
and now , while hinting last spring there were other women , he never actually said his sexting did not stop when he left @entity11			1
he says it 's behind him now			0
@entity130 , who is trying to manage his own political redemption as he runs for @entity22 comptroller , was no doubt thrilled to be asked about @entity10			1
he deflected the question , as if to implyâ € ” as others haveâ € ” that it 's a personal matter , between @entity10 and his wife			1
sad to say , it no longer is			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			2

@entity140 : when @entity10 left @entity11 , we assumed he would deal with problems
instead , he posed as @entity52 , *risking* further personal , political problems , she says
@entity140 says it 's more than a private matter since he 's running for @entity22 mayor
she says @entity10 is unable to tell the complete truth to those who *deserve* it
