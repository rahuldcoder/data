@entity0 -- the @entity2 predicts the shooting down of @entity4 17 , likely by @entity6 rebels , will fundamentally shift the relationship between @entity8 and the international community			1
" it is a game - changer , " one senior @entity11 official said			0
while @entity0 has stopped short of blaming @entity8 , @entity2 ambassador to the @entity15 @entity14 said friday the @entity2 believes the jet carrying nearly 300 people was downed by a surface - to - air missile fired by @entity6 rebels in eastern @entity20			1
@entity2 : @entity8 may have helped operate system due to the sophistication of the @entity24 missile system believed to have been used , @entity14 said it was " unlikely that the separatists could effectively operate the system without assistance from knowledgeable personnel			2
" that means " we can not rule out technical assistance from @entity8 personnel in operating the systems , " she added			0
is there a @entity8 cover - up ? officials said regardless of whether @entity8 operatives were manning the system , @entity8 bears responsibility for the attack because of its military and political support for the rebels			1
in recent weeks , @entity8 has intensified its delivery of sophisticated military equipment , officials said			2
" while it may take us some time to firmly establish who shot down a plane filled with innocents , most ( @entity48 ) members and most members of the international community have been warning for months about the devastation that would come if @entity8 did not stop what it started , if it did not rein in what it unleashed , " @entity14 said			2
another senior @entity2 official said that the " responsibility is @entity8 's whether they had @entity8 personnel there or they gave them equipment and an instruction manual " on what to do			1
" these separatist leaders are taking orders from @entity8 and ( @entity8 president @entity69 ) has to realize the consequence of sending heavy and sophisticated weapons to a gang of sociopaths , extremists , violent thugs , nationalists and agents who are just given weapons and told to make chaos , " the official said			1
why was the jet there ? the same official said that over the past 24 hours , @entity83 has played " the usual game of deflection , " noting it has put out " nonsense stories to send people down a rabbit hole " and hamper the investigation			0
" it 's not going to work , " the official said			0
" the outrage is too deep and the evidence , including videos of separatists bragging about this , is too damning			0
they will have a hard time explaining this away			1
" president @entity99 warned that without a stop in support to the rebels , @entity69 would face more international sanctions			0
the administration this week escalated sanctions on key business sectors of the @entity8 economy over @entity20			2
@entity69 and the @entity8 government " have to make a strategic decision , " @entity99 said on friday			2
" are they going to continue to support violent separatists whose intent is to undermine the government of @entity20 ? or are they prepared to work with the government of @entity20 to arrive at a cease fire and a peace that takes into account the interests of all @entity20 ? " @entity2 officials said it was unclear whether the incident could be a turning point in @entity8 's support for the rebels , but stressed a tough message would be sent to @entity69 once the final determination is made about what happened regarding @entity129 17			1
how will @entity69 respond ultimately , especially on personnel and weapons sent to @entity20 ? " if he ever had an intention of backing off , this could be an opportunity for him to do that , " another @entity2 official said			1
" i do n't think he does have that intention , though			0
" officials noted , however , the tragedy would likely close any gap between the @entity2 and the @entity140 over how severe the international response should be toward @entity8			1
" this is very likely to harden views that @entity8 is not a problem , " one official said			0
" if there were any @entity148 who believe it had nothing to do with them , that @entity20 was merely a local issue , that will change			0
" @entity152 17 full coverage			0
