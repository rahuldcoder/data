-- with nothing more than a piano , a little black dress and a microphone , @entity1 rouses crowds using her emotions and her voice			1
it 's her modus operandi , and it 's likely how viewers will see the @entity13 songstress perform at the @entity14 on sunday			1
the awards show will be @entity1 's first time taking the stage since she underwent laser microsurgery on a benign polyp on her vocal cords in november			1
that , in addition to the fact that she 's credited with the music industry 's 2011 uptick , means all eyes will certainly be on her			1
nominated for six @entity14 , including nods for album of the year and song of the year , @entity1 surprised fans when she tweeted about her impending performance			1
@entity33 , the associate director of charts at @entity35 , said he expects the singer to captivate viewers on sunday night , just as she did at the @entity38 in february 2011 and then again at the @entity39 in august			1
" on the off chance that she has a bum note , everyone has survived from a not great performance , " @entity33 said			2
" i do n't expect anything less than really good			0
" and still , a simple performance will be enough , he added			2
" you do n't see pyrotechnics and fog behind @entity1 , " @entity33 said			1
" she does n't need that			0
... there are no bells and whistles			0
it 's just her , great song writing , a beautiful voice and great charisma			2
" having already spent 18 weeks atop @entity35 's @entity57 , sold more than 6 million albums and spawned three chart - topping singles , @entity1 's ballads have also become anthems for scorned lovers everywhere			1
" every year , some album ends up at no. 1 , " said @entity63 , @entity64 's senior vice president of analytics for entertainment			2
" there 's always going to be something that rises to the top			2
but when it 's this unique and sales are this unprecedented , it 's special			2
" album sales rose in 2011 , marking the music industry 's first uptick since @entity77 's " confessions " sold 8 million units in 2004			1
and @entity1 is partially to thank for the boom			2
sales from her two albums -- her 2008 debut , " 19 , " and " 21 , " her sophomore album , released early last year -- accounted for 2 % of all industry album sales in 2011			2
" 19 " sold 460,000 units in 2009 , the year @entity1 won two @entity14 for the album			1
but , more than three years after its release , the singer 's catalog title had its best week in december , selling 71,000 units , @entity63 said			1
and so @entity1 finished out 2011 with two of the year 's best - selling albums			1
" it does take a very special artist , and a very special song and album release , to move the type of quantities we 're talking about here , " @entity63 said			0
according to @entity101 , " 21 " is the first album to sell more than 1 million digital copies in a year			0
" people say , ' how can there still be 100,000 people who do n't have this album ? ' ... it just shows the latent demand for great music out there , " @entity63 said			2
and there 's a good chance that after @entity1 performs at the @entity14 , the numbers will continue to grow throughout 2012 , he added			1
" every day , more and more people are just discovering her , or just being convinced that they should buy her album and not be content with listening to her on @entity119 or @entity120 , " said @entity33 , the associate director of charts at @entity35			0
speculation was heavy as to whether the @entity13 chanteuse would be able to perform at the @entity14 after her surgery			1
since the debut of her sophomore album , there have been breathless reviews and almost constant praise heaped upon the single - named singer			0
she 's even crossed over into meme territory in the form of a " s * * * @entity1 says " video			1
during her february 2011 appearance on @entity137 's " @entity136 , " @entity1 said she sees the constantly evolving interest in her music firsthand at her shows			1
" i love seeing the way people respond to my music , " she said			0
" i love it when , like , a husband or a partner gets dragged along who does n't want to be there , and you 've got to win them over because they 're giving you the evil ( eye )			0
... and by the end , they 're hugging their girlfriend ... or crying			0
" because her vocal cord issues forced her to cancel the remainder of her 2011 appearances , she was n't able to convert the disillusioned partners that might have been present at her shows			0
after falling ill , @entity1 stayed off the radar to rest up , @entity33 said , adding , " meanwhile , her singles are going to no. 1 , her albums continue to sell -- that 's the kind of career an artist would kill for			1
... everyone else is slogging around ... doing tv shows and concert tours			0
" @entity63 agreed , referencing artists such as @entity174 and @entity175 , who made their presence known in 2011 with advertisements and various appearances			0
yet , @entity1 's singles are still permanent fixtures on the radio , but not in the same way that @entity185 and the @entity186 are , @entity183 music columnist @entity182 said			1
" ( some pop artists ) live and die by their latest hit single , " @entity182 said			0
" and @entity1 , even though she 's having big hits , too ... you have the sense that her career probably wo n't always be as a big radio star			1
" she could be compared to someone like @entity196 , he said , " who has had hits , or not had hits , but has sold albums throughout a very long career			0
" regardless of how we 're hearing her music , @entity33 said , many people are finding it " refreshing that it is n't necessarily programmed for your enjoyment			0
" in fact , some people have said her music is actually programmed to play in the background while you weep			0
and there 's a " @entity213 " sketch to prove it			0
one @entity215 writer even profiled a few people brave enough to admit to crying along to @entity1 's " @entity217			1
" " ( @entity1 ) really struck a chord at the right time , " @entity63 said			2
" as soon as people heard it , it was gold			0
well , platinum , in this case			0

@entity1 will perform at the @entity14 on sunday night
it will be her first performance since *undergoing* surgery on a benign polyp
the @entity13 singer 's sales have helped give the music industry a boost
