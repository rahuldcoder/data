@entity0 -- if you think cutting the government 's budget is as easy as taking the ax to some unpopular federal programs , a new national poll suggests that you should think again			1
according to a @entity1 / @entity10 survey released friday , most @entity8 think that the government spends a lot more money than it actually does on such unpopular programs as foreign aid and public broadcasting			1
the poll 's release comes one week before current funding for the government runs out			1
if there is no budget agreement between congressional lawmakers by next friday , some government programs and offices may shut down			2
" the public has a better idea of how much the government spends on programs like @entity31 and @entity32 , but there is a related problem -- cutting them has little public support , " says @entity1 polling director @entity26			2
" the result : cutting unpopular programs would probably not cut the deficit very much , and cutting the deficit would probably require cuts in programs that @entity8 like			2
" let 's start with international assistance			0
sixty percent of people we questioned say they 'd like to put foreign aid on the chopping block			1
so would that make a dent in the deficit ? no -- but try telling that to the @entity8 public			2
according to the poll , on average , @entity8 estimate that foreign aid takes up 10 percent of the federal budget , and one in five think it represents about 30 percent of the money the government spends			1
but the actual figure is closer to 1 percent , according to data from the @entity60 from the 2010 fiscal year 's $ 3.5 trillion budget			1
let 's try more low - hanging fruit -- funding for the @entity66			2
our survey indicates nearly half of all @entity8 would like to see major cuts			0
according to our poll the public estimates that the government spent 5 percent of its budget last year on public television and radio			1
the real answer is about one - tenth of 1 percent			1
want more examples ? cutting pensions and benefits for government workers is popular , but once again most @entity8 overestimate how much that costs the government			2
on average , @entity8 think the federal government spent 10 percent of its 2010 budget on pensions and retiree benefits ; the @entity60 figures indicate the real number is about 3.5 percent			1
a sizeable minority would like to see food and housing assistance for the poor on the chopping block , but @entity8 ' estimates of how much the government spends on those programs are three to four times higher than the actual price tag			1
cuts in military spending also have some support -- more than a third of all @entity8 favor cuts in that area			0
but the public , once again , overestimates the amount of military spending			0
they told us 30 percent in our poll			0
in reality only 19 percent of the 2010 budget went towards military spending , according to 2010 @entity60 figures			0
what @entity8 got right are the programs they do n't want to cut			0
when we ask @entity8 to guess how much @entity31 cost the government in 2010 , the median estimate was 20 percent			1
not bad , given that @entity60 figures indicate that @entity31 represented 20.4 percent of the federal budget in 2010			0
" budget experts agree that cutting a target that big would be a good start toward getting the deficit under control			0
problem is , 87 percent of people we surveyed do n't want to decrease the amount of money spent on @entity31 -- and four in 10 would like to see that figure grow			0
the same is generally true for @entity32 and @entity133 , which combined made up 19 percent of last year 's budget , " adds @entity26			1
the @entity136 survey was conducted march 11 - 13 , with 1,023 people questioned by telephone			0
the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points			0
-- @entity1 deputy political director @entity142 contributed to this report			0
