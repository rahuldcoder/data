-- if you should find yourself visiting @entity2 -- or even if @entity2 is where you live -- there is a place i 'd like to recommend that you stop by			0
it wo n't cost you a penny , yet in its near - silence it offers a priceless perspective on the shrill , gossip - drenched , celebrity - saturated world that surrounds us			1
news of glitz and glamour bombards us 24 hours a day : on our computers , on our television sets , in our newspapers and magazines , on the screens of our telephones			0
a movie star gets in a jam , a singer fails a drug test , a sports star is named in a divorce proceeding -- there is an entire industry devoted to telling us about it , and it is an industry that never sleeps			0
the roar is constant and deafening			0
which is why there is value in spending a few minutes at 3 e. 53rd street in @entity35			1
it 's a hole in the city -- a slender rectangular space between @entity2 buildings			0
it is a park , commissioned more than 40 years ago by @entity41 , who was the pioneering chief executive of @entity42 , and named to honor his father , @entity43			2
it has a soothing waterfall , and trees and flowers , and white metal tables and chairs for anyone who wishes to find a moment of tranquility in a hectic world			2
it 's free ; it is a privately owned park , but the public is welcome			2
and the lesson it teaches is one that you will miss unless you know what used to be there			0
that modest - looking little sliced - out space on 53rd street once housed a structure that loomed as symbolically large and loud in the nation 's consciousness as a thousand big - band dance orchestras , as a million high - budget movie premieres			2
before there were internet entertainment - news sites , before there were nightly television shows dedicated to reporting on stars and who they date and what they wear , the building at 3 @entity79 53rd was the epicenter of what is now referred to as buzz			2
it was the @entity85 : the single @entity87 structure that most epitomized fame			1
the @entity85 was the capital of celebrity			1
it was the brick - and - mortar incarnation of what it meant to make it to the top			2
from 1934 , when the @entity85 moved to 53rd street after brief forays at other @entity35 locations , to 1965 , when it finally breathed its last , it was the most sought - after nightclub in the world			1
@entity100 would dine and drink there , as would @entity102 ; @entity103 was a customer , as were @entity104 and @entity105			0
mobster @entity106 was at home at the @entity85 , but so was @entity110 director @entity109			1
@entity112 , @entity113 , the @entity114 and @entity115 ... you get the picture			0
the @entity85 's owner , @entity117 , had his doormen guard the entrance not with a mere velvet rope , but with a 24 - karat gold chain			1
but that does n't explain the hold that the @entity85 had on the @entity87 imagination , or why it became the embodiment of stardom			1
the answer to that can be summed up in two words : @entity130			0
take every entertainment writer , broadcaster , magazine editor and web site purveyor in today 's star - soaked culture , combine their impact , and they do n't add up to @entity130 's reach at the peak of his power			1
how vast was that reach ? @entity146 , in his superlative 1994 biography of @entity130 , estimated that out of an adult @entity87 population of 75 million during the @entity148 years , 50 million either listened to his sunday night radio broadcast or read his column , which was syndicated to more than 2,000 newspapers			1
@entity130 's friend and attorney @entity153 put the number even higher ; he estimated that nine out of every 10 @entity87 adults either read or heard @entity130 every week			1
it was often said that , on warm summer sunday nights , you did not need to own a radio to hear @entity130 -- all you had to do was walk down the street and listen to his voice wafting out of all the open windows			0
and @entity130 's headquarters was the @entity85			1
from his seat at @entity166 in the nightclub 's @entity167 , he allowed the world of show - business grasping to come to him			0
the fighting that went on in the @entity85 was not usually conventional fisticuffs ; the backstabbing did not involve literal knives			1
but what went on in there was akin to climbing a slippery pyramid			0
what table a person was assigned to in the @entity85 ( assuming he or she even got in the front door ) , who he or she was seen dancing with ( often to a tune the orchestra called " the @entity186 " ) was a major determinant of national status and prestige			2
shining at the @entity85 , and currying favor with @entity130 , was a job in itself , to be undertaken with fierce and single - minded resolve			1
the stars did just that ; the process may have been superficial and it may have been tacky -- and it certainly was a queasy precursor to the celebrity - worshiping universe that is a part of the very air around us today -- but what went on at the @entity85 , as disseminated to the nation by @entity130 , made that building the most desired after - dark destination in the country			1
not that most @entity87 ever had a chance of stepping inside ; that address on 53rd street was the hottest of the hot , the most exclusive of the exclusionary			2
which is why going there today -- spending a quiet half hour in @entity208 -- can be such a calming experience			0
all heat eventually cools ; that which was coveted drifts away			1
the @entity85 fell out of fashion by the time the 1960s arrived , and when it closed its doors for the last time in 1965 and was then demolished , the spotlight - craving crowds had long since moved elsewhere			1
@entity130 has been dead since 1972 , his home newspaper , the @entity217 , having expired a decade before he did			0
it 's doubtful that many people , walking briskly along 53rd , pause to consider that the slim , boxy space leading to the waterfall on the back wall was once a magnet for desperate attention - seeking and strident clamor			2
take a walk into the tiny park , should you be in @entity35			1
listen to the bottoms of your shoes click against the cobblestones			0
pull up a chair at one of the tables			0
everyone is welcome ; there is no pecking order			0
when you get close enough to the waterfall , the sounds of the city disappear			0
where once there was mad commotion and frenzied striving , all of it seemingly so urgent , there is now a stillness steeped in serenity			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			2

before celebrity websites and cable *channels* , there was a home for celebrity culture in the @entity87
the @entity85 in @entity35 was scene of frenzied activity by the famous and would - be famous
@entity252 says all that remains is a *peaceful* park with a waterfall
@entity252 : " all heat eventually cools ; that which was coveted drifts away "
