the @entity0 spent five years reading and analyzing more than 6.3 million pages of @entity3 documents to assess the @entity3 's use of " enhanced interrogation techniques " in the post- 9/11 era			2
that review produced a more than 6,000 page review that was condensed into a 525 - page summary the committee released tuesday that delivered a brutal assessment of the @entity3 's practices			0
here are the report 's biggest conclusions and revelations : 1			0
" enhanced interrogation " includes torture sen. @entity18 writes in the report that the @entity0 's findings reveal that " @entity3 detainees were tortured			1
" " i also believe that the conditions of confinement and the use of authorized and unauthorized interrogation and conditioning techniques were cruel , inhuman , and degrading			0
i believe the evidence of this is overwhelming and incontrovertible , " she writes			0
president @entity29 said over the summer that , in the past , " we tortured some folks			0
" and sen. @entity32 , who was himself tortured as a pow during @entity34 , said on the @entity0 floor tuesday that the harsh interrogations described in the report amount to torture			1
the @entity3 has claimed throughout its defense of the program that these coercive interrogations " saved lives " -- the most significant point the @entity0 committee refutes in its report			1
@entity0 report : @entity3 misled public on torture 2			1
torture does n't work very well " the use of the @entity3 's enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of obtaining accurate information , " according to the @entity0 report			1
the report debunks the top 20 examples @entity3 has used to defend the now - shuttered enhanced interrogation program , claiming that each of the examples " was found to be wrong in fundamental respects			1
" additionally , false confessions obtained by enhanced interrogation techniques from detainees led the @entity3 to pursue dead leads that did not help in the fight against @entity63			2
information the @entity3 obtained through these harsh interrogations , which in some cases amounted to torture , was either false or had been previously obtained through alternative intelligence gathering , according to the report			1
" while being subjected to the @entity3 's enhanced interrogation techniques and afterwards , multiple @entity3 detainees fabricated information , resulting in faulty intelligence , " the report reads			1
the @entity3 and other advocates of these enhanced interrogation techniques , including former vice president @entity76 have continued to defend the practices as critical to intelligence gathering efforts in the fight against terrorism			1
@entity81 on torture report release : ' we want to be prepared ' the @entity3 pushed back against the report in its own assessment on tuesday , saying information obtained " substantially advance the @entity87 's strategic and tactical understanding of the enemy in ways that continue to inform counterterrorism efforts to this day			2
torture did not help the @entity3 find @entity93 the @entity3 continues to claim that coercive interrogations were crucial to capturing @entity93 , but the @entity0 report concludes that the most " accurate ' @entity3 information that led to @entity93 's capture came from a detainee before the detainee was tortured			1
the @entity3 claims that information obtained through coercion " fundamentally " changed the agency 's calculations			2
the @entity0 report insists that @entity93 could have been captured without the torture of any detainees			1
the " most accurate " @entity3 intelligence that led to @entity93 's capture came from @entity107 , who was captured in @entity108 in 2004			1
while @entity107 was later subjected to enhanced interrogations , the @entity0 report contends that @entity107 provided information that led to @entity93 's courier through traditional interrogation -- before he faced anything resembling torture			1
one detainee died , apparently from hypothermia , after being chained , nearly naked , to a concrete floor a glimpse of these techniques details how the @entity3 employed sleep deprivation to wear down victims : it " involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours , usually standing or in stress positions , at times with their hands shackled above their heads			1
" other techniques included " rectal rehydration , " " ice water ' baths , ' " and threatening detainees with threats to harm detainees ' families , including threats to " sexually abuse the mother of a detainee , " according to the summary of the report			2
related : ' this is not @entity141 ' other psychological tactics involved keeping detainees in pitch - black rooms " with loud noise or music and only a bucket to use for human waste			0
" and the rooms were cold -- freezing			0
one detainee , " who had been held partially nude and chained to a concrete floor " died in nov. 2002 from suspected hypothermia			1
@entity3 detainees who underwent these interrogation tactics were later found to experience " hallucinations , paranoia , insomnia and attempts at self - harm and self - mutilation			1
" medical personnel were sidelined and their concerns quieted when it came to coercive interrogations -- which the report says took precedent			1
the waterboardings of 9/11 mastermind @entity166 became , according to the report , " a series of near - drownings			0
" @entity166 was waterboarded at least 183 times			0
related : @entity32 makes passionate defense for torture report 's release another detainee , @entity173 , became unconscious and nearly died while he was waterboarded by @entity3 personnel			1
" in at least one waterboarding session , @entity173 ' became completely unresponsive , with bubbles rising through his open , full mouth , ' " the committee reports			0
" [ @entity179 ] remained unresponsive until medical intervention , when he regained consciousness and expelled " copious amounts of liquid			0
" videotape of @entity173 's two waterboarding sessions during a 21 - hour period disappeared from the @entity3 's records			0
the @entity3 misled the @entity187 , @entity188 , and other agencies president @entity190 was not briefed on " the specific @entity3 enhanced interrogation techniques before april 2006 , " according to @entity3 records cited in the @entity0 report			1
that means it took four years from the time the program began until the @entity197 had a full accounting of @entity3 interrogations			2
but by that time , 38 of the 39 detainees who faced the @entity3 's coercive interrogations had already been in custody and interrogated using those procedures			1
but a lack of @entity3 records means that more detainees may have also been tortured			2
the @entity0 report also concludes that the @entity3 " provided extensive amounts of inaccurate and incomplete information " to the @entity187 and top national security staff			1
" the @entity212 legal memo that justifies the use of enhanced interrogation techniques , according to the report , is based on evidence the report says is false			0
@entity3 officials overplayed or entirely misstated the success of the enhanced interrogation program when briefing @entity187 officials , according to the @entity0 report			1
they told @entity187 officials " that the @entity3 's enhanced interrogation techniques were uniquely effective and necessary to produce otherwise unavailable intelligence that the @entity141 government could not obtain from other sources , " the @entity0 report attests			1
there was little oversight of junior officers placed in charge of prisons junior officers were tasked with oversight of detention facilities and untrained @entity3 officers interrogated detainees unsupervised			2
at the @entity3 detention facility referred to as cobalt in the report , a " junior officer on his first overseas assignment with no previous experience or training in handling prisoners " was placed in charge			2
during his tenure , a detainee died of suspected hypothermia in 2002			0
@entity3 leadership attested in 2003 that they had " little or no awareness of operations at @entity236 " and in fact some did not know enhanced interrogation was underway at the facility			2
@entity255 call to @entity18 exposed @entity29 administration torture rift and the report also concludes that at least 17 detainees faced enhanced interrogations without a green light from @entity3 headquarters			1
other techniques used , including " abdominal slaps and cold water dousing , " were never approved by the @entity212			0
at least two mock executions were carried out at @entity236 without knowledge or approval from @entity3 headquarters			0
9/11 mastermind " beat " waterboarding @entity166 , the mastermind behind the 9/11 terror attacks , was waterboarded at least 183 times			0
the @entity3 said the method was effective in helping @entity3 interrogators pull information from @entity166 , but @entity3 interrogators painted a different picture in interview with the @entity3 's inspector general , according to the @entity0 report			2
@entity3 interrogators and medical personnel said @entity166 " hated it but knew he could manage , " and " figured out a way to deal with [ the waterboard ]			0
" @entity166 " beat the system " and one of his @entity3 interrogators attested that the suspected terrorist responded better to non-confrontational approaches			0
like others who were tortured , @entity166 often recanted information he told @entity3 officers to get them to stop the waterboarding			0
one of those fabrications included an assassination plot against former president @entity297 , which @entity3 officials described as an " elaborate tale			0
two government psychologists started a company that banked $ 81 million on interrogations two psychologists who helped develop the @entity3 's enhanced interrogation procedures founded a company in 2005 to help run the @entity3 's interrogations program			2
between 2005 and 2009 , the company pulled about $ 81 million from the government			0
the psychologists were previously involved in the @entity313 's " @entity312 school " and neither had " specialized knowledge of @entity63 , a background in counterterrorism , or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise , " according to the @entity0 committee 's report			0
and before founding the company , one of the psychologists recommended the use of coercive interrogation in the case of @entity320 , days before @entity320 was found dead of suspected hypothermia in 2002 .			0

@entity3 detainees were tortured , but those enhanced interrogations did n't yield actionable intelligence , the report concludes
the report also claims coercive interrogations did not lead to the capture of @entity93
*grisly* details of torture emerge in the report , including one who died after being chained , partially naked to a concrete floor
the @entity3 misled the @entity187 , @entity188 and other agencies to maintain a program that had little oversight
