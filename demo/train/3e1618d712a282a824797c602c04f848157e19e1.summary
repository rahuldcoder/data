-- thursday , the @entity1 revealed its efforts to reform the patent system , following up on president @entity5 's call in the @entity7 address			1
the @entity1 called on @entity8 to pass legislation to combat patent trolls , known less pejoratively as " patent assertion entities			1
" @entity13 's are firms that do n't manufacture anything			0
they buy patents and threaten to sue people to extract licensing fees , like the mythical troll charging a fee to cross a bridge			1
@entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 have each faced more than 100 such suits since 2009			0
critics suggest that trolls create a drag on innovation by diverting resources to litigation			2
in response , the @entity32 passed the @entity34 of 2013 in december			0
the @entity35 is considering various anti-troll bills			0
even the @entity37 has gotten into the act , hearing cases this term that relate to the troll issue			1
if all three branches of government are reacting to trolls , clearly they are a huge problem			1
except , they are n't			0
what is lost in this mudslinging is that much of what @entity50 do is laudable â € ” paying inventors			0
patents do n't grow on trees			2
someone came up with the invention and incurred considerable expense to obtain the patent			2
many inventors ca n't bring their invention to market themselves , however , so selling the patent may be the only way for them to make money			2
by buying these patents , @entity50 compensate inventors , one of patent law 's objectives			1
patents give their owners the right to seek compensation for unauthorized uses of the invention , so there is nothing wrong with a @entity13 enforcing a valid patent			1
the key word , though , is valid			0
problems arise when @entity50 sue on improperly issued patents , ones that never should have gotten out of the @entity81			1
for example , many patents on software and business methods -- areas where @entity50 often operate -- are not sufficiently different from earlier technology to justify the patent , or are too vague to discern what they legitimately cover			1
even though companies can knock these patents out in court , most parties settle			2
but , if they are n't legitimate patents , why do parties settle ? simple : to avoid the expense			2
according to a 2013 @entity100 survey , median litigation costs are $ 3.3 million when $ 10 million to $ 25 million is at stake			2
discovery -- the process of looking for evidence relevant to the case -- is responsible for much of the expense			0
defendants must wade through voluminous records and e-mails to find anything relevant to the case			0
for a case worth $ 10 million to $ 25 million , the survey estimates that the median cost through discovery in defending a @entity13 suit is $ 1.5 million			0
a pae does n't face these expenses			0
@entity102 is easy for it because all it has is the patent			2
plus , its lawyers usually take these cases on contingency , taking a percentage of whatever money they bring in , so there are no upfront attorney costs			1
when manufacturing companies face these costs , many simply settle , leaving the invalid patent in place			1
but these are not troll problems ; they are litigation and patent quality issues			2
scapegoating trolls risks disrupting the useful compensatory purpose they serve and may cause unintended consequences in non-troll litigation			1
unfortunately much of the @entity34 's proposals are ill - considered from this perspective			0
for example , the act makes all patent litigation -- troll and non-troll -- a " loser pays " system			0
the losing party must pay the attorney fees of the other side unless the loser 's case was " reasonably justified			0
" so , if a pae sues on a bad patent and loses , it may have to pay the company 's attorney fees			1
by having more skin in the game , hopefully @entity50 would think twice about asserting bad patents			1
unfortunately , the provision applies to all patent cases , likely increasing litigation expenses in all cases as parties fight over fees -- worrisome and chilling the willingness of non-trolls , such as startups , to enforce their patents			1
such legislation is premature because two of the troll - related cases at the @entity37 deal precisely with this issue			1
other provisions in the act attempt to reduce litigation expenses , but they inappropriately micromanage the federal courts			0
patent quality concerns must be addressed by the patent office			0
unfortunately , the relevant provisions of the @entity34 were removed prior to passage , so the final version contains no provisions relating to patent office procedures			1
the president 's proposals , however , are directed to improving the quality of the patent office 's review of patent applications			1
if successful , enhancing the clarity of what a patent covers would be a welcome improvement			0
the patent office 's efforts to create greater transparency of patent ownership is also important because @entity50 often hide their ownership behind various corporate shells			0
finally , in 2011 , @entity8 created new procedures to challenge patents after the patent office has issued them			1
@entity205 will tell whether they successfully enhance patent quality , yet the promise is there			0
but all three branches must remember that not all patent trolls are demons			1
paes create markets for compensating inventors			0
patent reform efforts should not myopically focus on trolls per se , or it may disrupt these markets and create other unintended consequences			2
reform must address patent quality and exorbitant litigation costs			1
the president 's proposals offer hope , but the @entity34 's efforts are misplaced			0
the @entity35 proposals are more modest			0
let 's hope @entity8 pauses to consider the broader role @entity50 play in our economy and appropriately tailors legislation to the patent system 's real problems			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			2

president @entity5 , @entity8 have proposed reforms to curb patent trolls
@entity37 is considering cases relating to the issue of patent trolls
@entity238 says some trolls sue to enforce bad patents , but others serve useful purpose
@entity238 : the problem is mostly with @entity81 failings and with exorbitant costs for lawsuits
