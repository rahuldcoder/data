-- there was a time that @entity3 believed justice had been served for her young son 's murder			2
but 16 years after the mutilations and killings of three 8 - year - old @entity9 , including her son , she has more doubts than ever			1
tear - stricken and angry , @entity3 sat through the original trial of the three accused teens -- @entity15 , 18 ; @entity16 , 17 , and @entity15 , 16			1
they were convicted of murdering her son , @entity15 , and two other neighborhood boys , @entity21 and @entity15			1
the second - graders ' bodies were found bruised and mutilated in a @entity25 , @entity26 , ditch ; their arms and legs were bound by shoe laces			1
the killers became dubbed the @entity15			1
when interviewed by media and documentary crews after the trial , @entity3 believed justice had been served			2
@entity16 and @entity15 had life sentences			1
@entity36 was on death row			2
but recent developments -- including new eyewitness statements and dna evidence from the defense -- have uprooted her faith in those prosecutions			1
once a staunch believer that the teens were guilty , now she says the teens accused of killing her son in the @entity15 deserve a new trial			1
" i wanted to believe in our justice system , " said @entity3 , now 45			2
she moved to @entity52 , @entity26 , shortly after the 1993 trial			1
" but time heals all wounds , and you start looking at things differently			1
" her public change of heart has been supported by new evidence presented by the defense over the past few years			1
in 2007 , @entity62 and forensic evidence tests revealed no physical evidence at the crime scene that linked the three teens to murders			1
the evidence was presented to the state			1
furthermore , dna that might belong to two other men was found in the knot used to tie @entity71			1
one of the men is @entity74 , the stepfather of @entity75 , the defense says			2
in 1993 , such advanced dna testing had not been available , attorneys said			1
the defense continues to argue the results of the dna evidence			1
in september , the @entity81 received an appeal from @entity36 , requesting a new trial after the lower courts denied his request to submit new dna evidence			1
this month , an @entity89 article stated @entity36 should be granted a new trial based on the 2007 dna evidence			1
the @entity81 will likely hear oral arguments for a new trial for @entity36 in february , say officials representing him			0
three eye witnesses , who resided next to one of the victims , filed affidavits in october with the @entity81			0
the witnesses said they saw the second - graders with @entity74 the night before the bodies were found by police			1
the statement from the witnesses contradicted @entity3 ' statements to police and in court that he never saw his stepson , @entity75 , on the day of the murder			2
" they [ authorities ] never really did any investigation , " said @entity112 , @entity36 ' defense attorney out of @entity113 , @entity114			0
" they never interviewed @entity119			0
the fact that the witnesses saw him , and they realized for the first time , it was very significant			0
" @entity3 was divorced from @entity74 in 2004 because of marital problems stemming from the pain that followed her son 's death , she said			0
she declined to comment on whether she thought her ex-husband saw the 8 - year - old boys			1
@entity3 has adamantly rejected the defense 's allegations that he saw his stepson that day			0
@entity3 , 51 , who still lives in @entity25 , said the defense is attempting to make him the target because @entity36 is on death row			0
there is no execution date set			0
he raises the question many skeptics of the three men 's innocence have echoed : why would the eyewitness evidence surface 16 years later ? why did n't the witnesses come forward sooner ? to this day , @entity74 says he believes the rightful killers are in prison			1
the @entity151 and prosecutors wo n't comment about the defense 's claims			0
@entity155 , prosecuting attorney for @entity156 , where the original trial took place , said the affidavits are weak			0
" i think most people will tell you these affidavits are insufficient to justify filing charges against someone else , " @entity155 said about the three new eyewitnesses presented by the defense			0
" they do n't contain enough evidence to enable a prosecuting attorney to make a charging position			2
" critics of the defense attorneys say there has been too much finger - pointing over the past 16 years			2
the defense " ca n't get their story straight , " said @entity174 , who started a web site criticizing supporters of the @entity15			1
an officer said they were told by the state 's attorney general 's office not to comment on the @entity15 case			1
during the original trial in 1993 , prosecutors argued the three teens were part of a satanic cult when they murdered the three children			2
they said punctures and cut marks on the victims were argued to be to be part of a sadistic ritual			0
after the trial , some forensic examiners argued those marks were animal bite marks			0
the prosecution relied on the confession of @entity16 , a 17 - year - old with learning disabilities and an iq of 70			1
he confessed after an untaped , three - hour interrogation by police without his parents or an attorney present			2
@entity16 later recanted his confession			0
the teens , now men serving time in the @entity26 penitentiary system , have maintained their innocence			0
they have tried appealing , arguing that they were n't adequately represented in the original trial			0
@entity36 remains on death row , and no execution date has been set			0
@entity3 has n't been the only parent of the victims to shift to the side of the @entity15 supporters			1
@entity222 , the father of @entity71 , lives in @entity223 , @entity224			0
he said he began to think the three men might be innocent , particularly after the 2007 dna tests results were released			1
his wife , @entity227 , passed away in 1996			0
after the murders , @entity222 announced to the media fervently that he believed the @entity15 were guilty			1
but by 2005 , he began to question the original trial			0
he said parts of @entity16 's confession did not match up with actual crime			2
for example , the confession talks about committing the crime in the woods , but medical examiners found few traces of blood in the woods			2
" the worst part about it is the three real victims that deserve justice , the three 8 - year - old children have not been given justice , " @entity222 said			1
" they got a hack job for a police investigation			0
it was a rush to find someone who they said did this			0
" @entity255 and @entity256 , parents of @entity21 , say the @entity15 are guilty			1
@entity257 , now divorced from @entity256 , says he ca n't believe the eyewitness affidavits because they are based on memories from 16 years ago			2
his ex-wife declined to comment			0
" they [ witnesses ] may have seen something , " said @entity21 , who now lives in @entity261 , @entity26			0
" but may 5 , 1993 , was n't the day			2
" the murders of the three boys remain etched into the community even years after the trial ended			2
the case inspired two @entity271 documentaries , " @entity272 : the child murders at @entity274 " and " @entity272 2			1
" as years passed , the @entity15 continued to live in the media spotlight			1
the case gained notoriety among celebrities such as the @entity279 and actress @entity280 , who have publicly said the three men should have a new trial			2
over the years , the parents of the three boys have watched the headlines return			0
some hope for a new trial for the three men , who have languished behind bars for their young adult years behind bars			0
and other parents pray the men will stay locked up for good			0
" i want someone to put a stop to this , " said @entity74			0
he fondly recalls the memories with his stepson -- the two of them swimming in the backyard pool			0
" i 'm tired of this stuff			0
no one understands or cares what this does to us as parents over and over again			0

new eyewitness statements emerge in @entity15 case
case centers on 1993 mutilations and murders of three 8 - year - old @entity9
" @entity314 heals all wounds and you start looking at things differently , " one mom says
dna tests in 2007 revealed no physical evidence linking the convicted killers to crime scene
