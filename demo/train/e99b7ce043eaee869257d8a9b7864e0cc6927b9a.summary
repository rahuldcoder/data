-- the @entity1 is upon us , and for the next month , there will be a significant uptick in the number of folks skipping work , watching games in the break room and wildly mispronouncing @entity11 surnames			2
want to get in on the fun surrounding this quadrennial event that stokes the intensest of passions while doing considerable damage to some countries ' gross domestic products for the month ? here are some fun facts to get you started : let the games begin the host country , @entity22 , will kick off the action against @entity24 at 4 p.m. et thursday in @entity25			1
the @entity22 squad is a heavy favorite , but @entity24 is no slouch , boasting several stars who play in @entity31 's top leagues			1
keep an eye on one of them just before kickoff : forward @entity36			2
born in the slums outside @entity38 , he now plays for the @entity40 national team , and his mother reportedly says he intends to sing both countries ' national anthems			1
64 games , like @entity45 , but not there is only one game on the first day of the @entity1 , but between thursday and june 26 , all 32 teams who qualified will play three games each in what is known as the group stage			1
garnering three points for every win and a point for every tie , the teams will be whittled down to the best 16 -- two from each of the eight groups			0
they will then face off in a do - or - die knockout round beginning june 28			0
your @entity45 bracket ? yeah , it will look like that , but with a quarter of the teams			1
the final is july 13			0
only world war can stop it the @entity1 has been held every four years since 1930 with the exception of 1942 and 1946 , when it was canceled because of @entity72 this will be the 20th @entity1			1
it 's the eighth time it 's been held in @entity75 or @entity76 and the second time in @entity22 , the first one being 64 years ago			1
only @entity78 teams have won @entity79 held in the @entity80 , and the last @entity81 was won by @entity82 on home soil in 1978			2
speaking of winners there is n't much parity to the @entity1			0
in fact , only eight teams have won it			0
@entity90 , @entity91 and defending champion @entity92 have won it once each			0
@entity82 and @entity95 have won it twice			0
@entity98 has held the trophy aloft three times , @entity97 has claimed victory four times and @entity22 has won it five times			2
why on @entity104 do the @entity22 need home - field advantage again ? it 's not all fun and games allegations of corruption within world soccer 's governing body , @entity113 , and class warfare within the host nation are casting a pall over the @entity1 , though do n't expect it to dampen fans ' fervor once the teams take the pitch			1
specifically , a key sponsor , @entity121 , is demanding an investigation into the controversial award of the @entity124 to @entity125 , and in @entity22 , protesters are asking why an emerging nation is spending billions on hosting a football tournament rather than using it to alleviate poverty .			0

@entity24 's @entity22 - born @entity36 reportedly will sing both national anthems
group stage whittles teams down to 16 , which then enter @entity45 - style bracket
since 1930 , @entity1 has been held every four years except in 1942 and 1946
only eight teams have won @entity1 ; @entity22 has won five and now has home - field advantage
