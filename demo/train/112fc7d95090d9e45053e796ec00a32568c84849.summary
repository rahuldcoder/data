@entity0 -- when @entity6 presidential candidate and @entity4 favorite @entity3 was recently asked by @entity8 ' @entity7 if she was " a flake , " the moment seemed like déjà vu all over again for some women active in politics			1
@entity3 's response -- she was " insulted " -- was stern , but it pointed to a larger bias many women perceive in presidential politics			1
" nobody in the @entity6 establishment is going to hand anything to @entity3 or ( @entity24 ) @entity23 -- just like ( @entity25 ) did not for @entity19 ( @entity26 ) , " said @entity17 , who supported @entity19 's 2008 presidential bid			1
" and it takes a certain type of leader to go out there and have the courage and the guts to say ' i 'm running ( for president ) ' and i admire @entity3 for that			2
" after @entity26 's failed @entity37 bid , @entity17 and a small group of women who had supported @entity26 decided the best way to break the glass ceiling in presidential politics was to put ideology and partisanship aside and support any woman seeking a top political office -- including @entity3 and @entity23 , two darlings of the tea party movement known for their conservative views on economic and social issues			1
but some @entity25 leaders dismissed the idea , arguing the electorate is more sophisticated			0
" women do n't support women candidates simply because of their status as women , simply because of their gender , " said rep. @entity54 , head of the @entity55			2
@entity17 , who has voted @entity61 in the past , helped found @entity62 , a nonpartisan women 's advocacy group that united many women who were disappointed after @entity26 's defeat			1
" we decided that in order to take women forward , " said @entity17 , " we would have to be a voice for all women -- so put political party and the issue of abortion aside because those were the two issues that were dividing women in half			2
" " so , for us it was a business model : how can you have a women 's movement that excludes half the women ? " added @entity17			2
in the 2008 general election , women voted overwhelmingly for @entity61 @entity83 for president , picking him 56 % to 43 % over @entity6 @entity85 , according to @entity1 exit polls			1
going hard after democrats before the new group even got formally off the ground in mid- 2008 , its nucleus of @entity19 supporters was courted by @entity85 's campaign , according to @entity17			1
" @entity85 sent ( former @entity99 @entity6 senatorial candidate ) @entity100 to my home , " said @entity17 , who used to trade distressed debt on @entity95 , " to meet with a lot of the women that then became @entity62 to say : what would you want to get @entity85 's support ? " " one of the things we asked for was to have a woman on the ticket , " said @entity17 , " and @entity23 actually was on our short list ( of six women )			1
we did research and learned about her			0
" when then - @entity113 gov. @entity23 burst onto the national political stage soon after @entity26 formally ended her presidential aspirations , @entity17 and @entity116 , another 2008 @entity26 supporter , saw how @entity23 was falling victim to sexist treatment just as @entity26 had			1
@entity116 is an assistant professor of political science at @entity120 whose research has focused on candidates for the presidency			0
she described @entity23 in 2008 as " a completely different candidate ( from @entity26 ) " who got " a completely different sexist barrage of commentary			1
" what was behind the treatment of both @entity26 and @entity23 that at least some political observers viewed as sexist or misogynistic ? " the system that 's the problem here , the system that 's the barrier is , broadly , patriarchy , " said @entity131 , an associate professor at @entity132			1
" but , more specifically , when women run for public office , the press is more likely to talk about their dress and appearance , more likely to challenge their competency , more likely to talk about them in kind of ' first woman ' terms or like they 're oddities or benchwarmers instead of actual candidates			0
" @entity131 noticed that both @entity26 and @entity23 tried to project a public image during the 2008 race that was simultaneously masculine enough to justify being selected as the next president or vice president and feminine enough to satisfy traditional gender roles			1
" ( @entity26 ) wore pants suits with pearls			0
... she was properly masculine and properly feminine , " said @entity131			0
" ( @entity26 ) did this performance and it did n't quite work			0
and then @entity23 is doing this performance where she is taking the line between masculine and feminine and she takes a wide stance			2
she 's hyper - masculine			0
and then she 's also hyper - feminine			0
... she was still beaten up			0
( @entity23 ) provided kind of a different brand or approach than @entity19 and it did n't matter			1
" @entity3 facing same stigma ? years after @entity26 and @entity23 sought the @entity166 , @entity3 is already starting to encounter some of the same challenges as a female candidate			1
" it 's already started with @entity3 , " @entity131 said , referencing treatment by the media that she considers sexist			1
" the @entity7 question was insulting , " said @entity3 campaign spokeswoman @entity171			2
" congresswoman @entity3 is a serious candidate			2
she 's an extremely intelligent person			0
she 's successful in her personal life			0
... professionally , she has been a successful tax attorney , been a successful member in state politics , and a successful member of @entity178			0
she 's a serious , very credible candidate for the president of the @entity180			0
( @entity7 ) apologized , she accepted the apology and we 've put that behind us			0
" but @entity183 , chairman of the @entity184 , was less diplomatic			0
" i certainly could n't have seen @entity7 asking @entity185 or @entity186 or @entity187 or one of them , ' are you a flake ? ' " said @entity183			0
after a breakout performance at the recent @entity1 @entity6 debate in @entity193 , @entity3 has been steadily rising in the polls , particularly with conservative likely @entity6 caucusgoers in all - important @entity196			1
the woman who had been brushed aside for a leadership role in the @entity199 after the 2010 midterms now leads in three recent polls , ahead of all the men and in particular , @entity185 , who has been called the front - runner by many			0
making too much of nothing have the candidacies of @entity26 , @entity23 and now @entity3 ignited a spark among women across the political spectrum that national @entity25 and the @entity83 re-election campaign should be worried about ? no , said the @entity55			1
" there was a lot made of @entity23 being chosen by @entity85 and of there being a woman on ( the @entity6 ) ticket for the first time in the last election and how attractive that might be especially to @entity19 supporters after the primary ended , " said @entity55 chair @entity54			1
" i thought that was not credible at the time and said so and it turned out not to be credible			0
" @entity54 said women vote on the issues that matter to them and select the candidate who champions those issues			0
she pointed out that president @entity83 has signed the @entity227 , fought for passage of health care legislation that benefits women , has a number of women in his administration and has appointed two women to the @entity180 @entity235			0
by contrast , the @entity55 head said that none of the contenders in the current @entity6 presidential field has @entity83 's track record when it comes to supporting women and working families and championing equal rights for women , both reproductive rights and rights in the workplace			1
should @entity23 choose to run for president in this cycle , @entity54 predicted that female voters will reject @entity23 just as they did in 2008			2
that same fate , she added , will befall @entity3 should she win the @entity6 nomination			1
no matter how @entity3 ultimately fares , her candidacy -- like @entity23 's before her -- seems to be energizing conservative women in particular			1
@entity258 is a co-founder of @entity259 , a group dedicated to getting more conservative women involved in politics and running for office			2
@entity263 said the rise of conservative women on the national political scene in the past few years " was just the beginning			0
" " i think we 'll learn a lot ( by ) having @entity3 run ( for president ) about what kind of things conservative women need to be prepared for if they 're going to enter the national spotlight , " said @entity263 .			2

former @entity19 supporters now impressed by @entity6 women
@entity3 , @entity23 seen as best way to break the glass ceiling in presidential politics
democrats dismiss *interest* , pointing to @entity23 's defeat in 2008
