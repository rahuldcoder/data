@entity0 -- they are the nation 's first @entity4 - @entity4 president and attorney general , so @entity7 and @entity8 always were going to face extra scrutiny over their approach to racially charged issues			1
conservative critics howled when @entity7 said in 2009 that police acted " stupidly " in arresting black @entity16 professor @entity15 outside his home			2
@entity8 prompted a similar outcry earlier that year when he called @entity19 a " nation of cowards " about racial issues			1
now past the two - thirds mark of the @entity7 presidency , the pair have avoided such loaded language in response to the august 9 shooting death of unarmed 18 - year - old @entity29 by a white police officer in suburban @entity31			1
root causes while @entity8 recently reiterated his " nation of cowards " statement , he and @entity7 have tried to focus attention on root causes of racial division in the aftermath of @entity29 's killing , which has sparked more than a week of unrest on the streets of @entity44 , @entity45 , chronicled by widespread media coverage			1
" the eyes of the nation and the world are watching @entity44 right now , " @entity8 said wednesday during a visit to the community			1
" the world is watching because the issues raised by the shooting of @entity29 predate this incident			0
this is something that has a history to it , and the history simmers beneath the surface in more communities than just @entity44			2
" on thursday , he said " few things have affected me as greatly " as his trip to @entity44 , and he cited a " sense of mistrust and mutual suspicion " between law enforcement and residents as something that needs to change			1
" i wanted the people of @entity44 to know that i personally understood that mistrust , " @entity8 said			1
in commenting on the matter earlier this week , @entity7 also spoke of troubled minority communities that " as a consequence of tragic histories , often find themselves isolated , often find themselves without hope , without economic prospects			2
" " you have young men of color in many communities who are more likely to end up in jail or in the criminal justice system than they are in a good job or in college , " he said			0
" and , you know , part of my job -- that i can do , i think , without any potential conflicts -- is to get at those root causes			0
" racial issues to @entity1 political commentator @entity101 , a series of divisive racial issues since @entity7 took office have shaped the president 's approach			1
first came a white police officer 's arrest of @entity15 , a prominent @entity4 - @entity4 scholar , as he tried to get into this own locked home			0
in 2012 , the shooting of unarmed @entity109 teenager @entity108 by neighborhood watch captain @entity110 roiled the nation , and now there 's the @entity29 killing			0
" any time a situation like this occurs , he becomes more of a more centrist , emotionally , " @entity101 said wednesday			1
" but in terms of what he is actually saying to the @entity4 people , he 's becoming much more thoughtful			0
" in the aftermath of the @entity108 killing and soaring gun violence in @entity123 and elsewhere , @entity7 this year launched the @entity125 program to provide mentoring and other support for @entity4 and @entity129 boys in rough neighborhoods			2
@entity8 , meanwhile , has launched 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years , more than twice the number of such inquiries in the previous five years			1
calming affect ? he said wednesday that he hoped his visit to @entity44 would have a calming affect by showing the federal government was investigating			2
at the same time , @entity8 made clear that federal authorities were examining possible civil rights violations under their jurisdiction , while state and local authorities would continue their criminal investigation of @entity29 's killing			1
a child of the civil rights era , @entity8 told his own stories of racial profiling -- his car being searched during a traffic stop on the @entity151 ; police officers stopping him as he ran to a movie theater in @entity0 's tony @entity155 neighborhood			1
" at the time that he stopped me , i was a federal prosecutor , " @entity8 said			2
" i was n't a kid			0
... i worked at the @entity159			0
so i 've confronted this myself			0
" " a good step " @entity162 , a @entity31 city alderman , called @entity8 's visit " a good step " because it showed that the community 's plight was " at the top of his priority list			0
" a decade younger than @entity8 , @entity7 has taken a present - day approach to personalizing his experience as black in @entity19			1
after @entity108 was killed by @entity110 two years ago , the president called for a full investigation , noting that " if i had a son , he would look like @entity108			0
" in his remarks monday , @entity7 avoided any assessment of blame in the @entity29 killing , saying " i have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed			0
" he admonished an overzealous police response that has dispersed peaceful demonstrators , as well as looting and other protest violence that he said undermined the goal of seeking justice			0
