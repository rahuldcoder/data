" there is no need to dwell on what you experienced and what the world witnessed , " the president said , speaking to a crowd that included current @entity0 mayor @entity22 and members of @entity1 's @entity25 delegation			1
" we all remember it keenly -- water pouring through broken levees ; mothers holding their children above the waterline ; people stranded on rooftops begging for help ; and bodies lying in the streets of a great @entity44 city , " @entity4 said			1
" it was a natural disaster but also a man - made catastrophe ; a shameful breakdown in government that left countless men and women and children abandoned and alone			0
" but the president spoke of the resilience of city residents			2
" because of all of you -- all the advocates , all the organizers who are here today , folks standing behind me who have worked so hard and never gave up hope , you are all leading the way toward a better future for this city with innovative approaches to fight poverty , improve health care , reduce crime and create opportunities for young people -- because of you , @entity0 is coming back			1
" the president noted that @entity0 is now one of the nation 's fastest - growing cities , and small businesses have surged			1
" five years ago , the @entity74 had to play every game on the road because of the damage to the @entity78 , " he said			0
" two weeks ago , we welcomed the @entity74 to the @entity80 as @entity82 champions			0
" " i do n't have to tell you that there are still too many vacant and overgrown lots , " @entity4 said			1
" there are still too many students attending classes in trailers			0
there are still too many people unable to find work			0
and there 's still too many @entity0 folks who have n't been able to come home			1
" " so while an incredible amount of progress has been made , on this fifth anniversary , i wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly : my administration is going to stand with you -- and fight alongside you -- until the job is done , until @entity0 is all the way back			1
" he said his administration has made efforts to reduce red tape and turf wars between agencies , and has put in place a new way to handle disputes , with help from sen. @entity115 , @entity1			2
more than 170 projects are now underway as a result , he said			2
in addition , federal officials are tackling " corruption and inefficiency that has long plagued the @entity122 , " he said			0
and a group led by housing secretary @entity124 and homeland security secretary @entity125 is examining disaster recovery nationwide			0
" we 're improving coordination on the ground , modernizing emergency communications and helping families plan for a crisis , " @entity4 said			1
" and we 're putting in place reforms so that never again in @entity44 is someone left behind in a disaster because they 're living with a disability or because they 're elderly or because they 're infirm			0
that will not happen again			0
" on friday , he said , his administration announced a final agreement on $ 1.8 billion for @entity0 schools , money the president said had been " locked up for years , but now it 's freed up , so folks here can determine how best to restore the school system			1
" in addition , the largest civil works project in @entity44 history -- the construction of a fortified levee system to protect @entity0 -- is underway and will be finished by next year , he said			1
" together we are helping to make @entity0 a place that stands for what we can do in @entity44 -- not just for what we ca n't do , " he said			2
" and ultimately , that must be the legacy of @entity6 : not one of neglect , but of action ; not one of indifference , but of empathy ; not of abandonment , but of a community working together to meet shared challenges			2
" some wounds , the president acknowledged , have not yet healed , and " there are some losses that ca n't be repaid			0
for many who lived through those harrowing days five years ago , there are searing memories that time may not erase			0
but even amid so much tragedy , we saw the stirrings of a brighter day			0
" he said he recalled being struck , upon visiting @entity0 four years ago , by the amount of greenery that had returned			2
" the work ahead will not be easy , " he said , " and there will be setbacks			0
there will be challenges along the way			0
but thanks to you , thanks to the great people of this great city , @entity0 is blossoming again			2
