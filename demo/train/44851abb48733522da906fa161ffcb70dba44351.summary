@entity0 , @entity1 -- it is expected to be a court date like no other , with @entity1 riveted to a financial corruption case that involves members of the royal family			1
on saturday , princess @entity10 , the youngest daughter of @entity11 , will be the first direct member of @entity1 's royal family to testify in court while facing preliminary charges for a crime , @entity1 's royal household has confirmed			1
her husband , @entity16 , faces preliminary charges in the same matter and already testified , a year ago			2
the case centers on his nonprofit @entity21 foundation that received millions of dollars in government contracts to stage sports and tourism events			2
judge @entity25 is investigating whether part of that money was diverted for private use by the princess , who is 48 , and her husband , 46			2
through their legal teams , both deny any wrongdoing			0
the closed - door testimony for the princess will be held at a local court in @entity37 in the @entity38			0
the courthouse is not far from the @entity40 , the royal family 's summer residence on @entity42 , one of @entity45 's top tourist destinations			0
judge @entity25 last april leveled preliminary charges against the princess in this case , but they were dropped in may after prosecutors appealed to a provincial court , citing insufficient evidence			2
but @entity25 continued his investigation and last month issued a 227 - page order , again bringing preliminary charges against the princess , for alleged tax fraud and money laundering through a separate company , @entity60 , in which she had a 50 % stake , with her husband holding the rest			2
" they used that company to pocket the public money and also to pay the lowest possible tax or simply cheat the @entity72 , " said @entity63 , investigations editor at @entity65 newspaper who co-authored a book , " @entity68 , " about the alleged financial improprieties			0
" in that company , princess @entity10 is the one who signs the annual reports , " @entity63 said			1
when the new preliminary charges were filed in january , @entity10 's top lawyer , veteran politician and defense attorney @entity77 , told reporters they would appeal			1
but a week later , there was a sudden change of position , and it was announced that the princess would testify			2
the about - face was not due to pressure from the royal household , but instead was a personal decision by the princess , who persuaded her defense team on the issue , said an official familiar with discussions within the royal household , who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
" it was her decision to testify , simply because she has nothing to hide , and she 's convinced the preliminary charges could be dropped , and it 's better to testify than let the idea of cowardice be out there , " the official said			0
the preliminary charges eventually could be dropped , but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion			0
the case is one of various financial corruption scandals affecting the royal family and major political parties and a leading union , during the economic crisis , when many @entity1 have lost jobs or had to tighten their financial belts			1
princess @entity10 's testimony comes as a new report by the @entity119 shows that 95 % of @entity1 say that corruption is widespread in the nation			1
the royal household two years ago excluded @entity10 and her husband from representing @entity1 at official functions , like one this week in @entity0 , when the @entity11 , @entity125 , crown prince @entity126 and his wife , @entity127 , welcomed the foreign diplomatic corps			1
but some @entity1 say the princess is still getting special treatment			1
" it 's great they 're finally bringing preliminary charges , " said student @entity131 , outside the royal palace in @entity0			0
" but considering she 's the @entity11 's daughter , she 'll be very protected , and wo n't go to jail			1
" a columnist for @entity138 newspaper , @entity139 , predicts the testimony on saturday could be the beginning of the end of the case against the princess			1
he writes that the judge again faces opposition from a prosecutor who says there 's still insufficient criminal evidence against the princess			0
and that the case may be dropped before reaching trial			0
@entity152 , president of the @entity154 union of tax agency technicians who work at the @entity157 , said it 's unusual for a prosecutor to seemingly side with the princess , who 's facing preliminary charges of tax fraud , instead of standing up for the interests of the nation 's tax collection agency .			0
