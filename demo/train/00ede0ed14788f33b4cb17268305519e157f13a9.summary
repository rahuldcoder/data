sixty years after the overthrow of @entity4 prime minister @entity3 , a declassified @entity1 document acknowledges that the agency was involved in the 1953 coup			1
the independent @entity8 research institute , which published the document monday , says the declassification is believed to mark the @entity1 's first formal acknowledgment of its involvement			1
the documents , declassified in 2011 and given to @entity15 research group under the @entity16 , come from the @entity1 's internal history of @entity4 from the mid- 1970s and paint a detailed picture of how the @entity1 worked to oust @entity3			1
in a key line pointed out by @entity20 , the editor who worked through the documents , the @entity1 spells out its involvement in the coup			0
" the military coup that overthrew @entity3 and his @entity29 cabinet was carried out under @entity1 direction as an act of @entity33 foreign policy , conceived and approved at the highest levels of government , " the document says , using a variation of the spelling of @entity3 's name			1
while this might be the @entity1 's first formal nod , the @entity33 role has long been known			1
president @entity39 acknowledged the @entity33 ' involvement in the coup during a 2009 speech in @entity43			0
" in the middle of the @entity46 , the @entity33 played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected @entity4 government , " the president said			1
in 2000 , then - @entity33 secretary of state @entity50 spoke of the intervention , and in the same year , the @entity53 published what it said was a leaked 1954 @entity1 - written account of the overthrow			2
@entity4 elected @entity3 prime minister in 1951			2
quickly , the leader moved to nationalize oil production in the country -- a move that would have been a serious blow to the @entity33 and @entity62 and a win for the @entity64			0
because of the failure of oil negotiations with @entity4 , along with a number of other issues , the @entity33 was concerned " that @entity4 was in real danger of falling behind the @entity70			2
" " if that happened , it would mean a victory for the @entity64 in the @entity46 and a major setback for the @entity78 in the @entity79 , " @entity71 , a principal planner of the mission , wrote within months of the overthrow			0
" it was the aim of the @entity82 project " -- that was the mission 's code name -- " to cause the fall of the @entity3 government ; to reestablish the prestige and power of the @entity89			0
" shortly after @entity3 's election , the @entity1 began to plan his overthrow			2
the goal of the coup was to elevate the strength of @entity89 and appoint a new prime minister -- gen. @entity96			0
before the coup , the agency -- along with the @entity98 -- helped foment @entity100 fervor using propaganda , according to @entity1 documents			2
" in @entity4 , @entity1 and @entity104 propaganda assets were to conduct an increasingly intensified effort through the press , handbills and the @entity109 clergy in a campaign designed to weaken the @entity3 government in any way possible , " @entity71 wrote			1
on august 19 , 1953 , the coup swung into full effect as the @entity1 and @entity62 intelligence agency helped pull @entity116 forces together and organized large protests against @entity3			1
" the @entity118 very soon joined the @entity116 movement and by noon that day it was clear that @entity109 , as well as certain provincial areas , were controlled by @entity116 street groups and @entity118 units , " @entity71 wrote			0
" by the end of 19 august ... members of the @entity3 government were either in hiding or were incarcerated			0
" in order to provide @entity96 , the country 's new prime minister , with some stability , the " @entity1 covertly made available $ 5,000,000 within two days of @entity96 's assumptions of power			0
" after the coup , @entity3 was sentenced to death , but the sentence was never carried out			0
the former leader died in @entity109 in 1967			0
even 60 years removed , the 1953 coup still hangs over @entity33 - @entity4 relations			1
@entity4 politicians and religious leaders still use the coup as a way to foment anti-american sentiment			2
@entity142 , @entity4 president from 2005 until earlier this year , demanded apologies from the @entity33 for " crimes " the @entity1 committed in @entity4 during the 1953 coup			1
" the issue is more than academic , " wrote @entity20 of @entity15			0
" political partisans on all sides , including the @entity4 government , regularly invoke the coup to argue whether @entity4 or foreign powers are primarily responsible for the country 's historical trajectory , whether the @entity33 can be trusted to respect @entity4 's sovereignty , or whether @entity154 needs to apologize for its prior interference before better relations can occur			1

a newly declassified document acknowledges the @entity1 's hand in ousting @entity3
while this might be the @entity1 's first formal nod , the @entity33 role has long been known
the @entity1 used propaganda , along with other politicians and leaders in @entity4 , to *unseat* @entity3
even 60 years removed , the 1953 coup still hangs over @entity33 - @entity4 relations .
