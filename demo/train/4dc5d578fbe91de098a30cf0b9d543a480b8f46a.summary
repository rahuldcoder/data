-- @entity2 graffiti artist @entity1 has launched an art exhibition in @entity4 that he hopes will focus attention on the poverty of the @entity7 and draw tourists to the traditional birthplace of @entity10			1
a @entity12 man walks by @entity1 's camel , painted on the security barrier near @entity4			1
as part of the project , @entity1 has adorned the controversial security barrier around the @entity7 town with spray paint and plaster works of art in a comment on the @entity24 - @entity12 conflict			1
@entity24 says the purpose of the barrier is to prevent terrorist attacks being launched from the @entity7			1
@entity12 leaders however say the barrier amounts to an illegitimate land grab by @entity24 , setting unilateral borders for an eventual @entity12 state			0
the new exhibition , called " @entity35 's @entity34 2007 , " is a collaboration by artists who say they are trying to revitalize tourism to @entity4 and " offer the ink - stained hand of friendship to ordinary people in an extraordinary situation			1
" @entity1 's sketches on the security barrier flow towards @entity45 , across from the @entity46 , where @entity47 believe @entity48 was born			1
his images include a dove wearing a bullet - proof vest , a young girl in a frilly pink dress frisking a soldier and a donkey being checked for its identity papers			0
according to the web site for @entity35 's @entity34 , @entity1 thought he was making an ironic commentary with the donkey picture , but locals told him the animals are frequently asked for @entity64 papers			1
@entity35 's @entity34 typically operates during the month of december out of a small store on @entity66 in @entity67 , where underground artists showcase their work			2
@entity1 , who started the initiative six years ago , says : " i felt the spirit of @entity72 was being lost			2
it was becoming increasingly uncommercialized and more and more to do with religion , so we decided to open our own shop and sell pointless stuff you did n't need			0
" his exhibition in @entity4 is rife with the same satirical sentiments			2
beyond the barrier graffiti , the work of @entity35 's @entity34 's diverse artists spread across three floors of a building in @entity45			1
inside , examples include a painting by @entity12 artist @entity88 in which a man carries the city of @entity92 on his back , and @entity67 artist @entity95 's montage of dollar bills printed on pages from the @entity98			2
proceeds from @entity35 's ghetto sales go to charity			0
@entity102 is known about @entity1 other than that he was born in @entity103 , western @entity104			2
collections of his original work , which attract the likes of @entity108 and @entity109 , have sold for more than $ 1 million ( almost Â£ 500,000 )			0
@entity1 's previous political statements have included hanging a picture of a cave man pushing a shopping cart in the @entity114 and placing a doll of a @entity117 detainee in @entity118			1
the doll was removed , but the " primitive " portrait became a part of the @entity114 's permanent collection			0
tourism -- even in the traditional @entity72 peak season -- has been hard hit in recent years with @entity24 checkpoints keeping most of the local @entity12 in and all but the most determined tourists out			0
as a result levels of unemployment are high			0
speaking through the web site , @entity1 says tourists need not fear visiting the @entity7			1
" it would do good if more people came to see the situation here for themselves			0
" if it is safe enough for a bunch of sissy artists then it 's safe enough for anyone			0
" e-mail to a friend			0

graffiti artist @entity1 uses @entity4 security barrier as his latest *canvas*

@entity1 's identity is kept secret , adding to his allure
