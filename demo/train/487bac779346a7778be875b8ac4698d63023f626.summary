-- on july 24 , 2008 , then - presidential candidate @entity1 addressed tens of thousands of @entity2 on the avenue that leads from the @entity4 in @entity5			1
in a pointed reference to the outgoing administration of president @entity8 , he promised a new era of " allies who will listen to each other , who will learn from each other , who will , above all , trust each other			0
" one @entity2 present among the hugely enthusiastic crowd said the occasion reminded him of @entity5 's famous " @entity20			1
" no @entity22 politician since @entity23 had so captured @entity25 ' imagination			1
five years on , in the words of the song , it 's a case of " after the love has gone			0
" the @entity22 ambassador in @entity5 has been summoned to the foreign ministry over reports in @entity34 that the @entity35 ( @entity36 ) monitored chancellor @entity38 's official cellphone			1
his counterpart in @entity40 received a similar summons earlier this week after revelations in @entity43			1
@entity38 says @entity25 's trust must be repaired after @entity22 spying claims both @entity34 and @entity43 used documents provided by former @entity36 contractor @entity47			1
@entity38 's spokesman , @entity49 , lamented a " grave breach of trust			0
" one of chancellor @entity38 's closest allies , defense minister @entity51 told broadcaster @entity54 there would be consequences			0
" we ca n't simply turn the page , " he warned			0
@entity34 reported thursday that @entity60 , who leads the parliamentary committee that scrutinizes @entity2 's intelligence services , complained that " the @entity36 's monitoring activities have gotten completely out of hand , and take place beyond all democratic controls			0
" in an article for the forthcoming edition of @entity72 magazine , @entity67 and @entity68 argue that it 's the disclosure of such practices rather than their existence that is damaging			0
" when these deeds turn out to clash with the government 's public rhetoric , as they so often do , it becomes harder for @entity22 allies to overlook @entity83 's covert behavior and easier for @entity22 adversaries to justify their own , " they write			1
" the @entity22 government , its friends , and its foes can no longer plausibly deny the dark side of @entity22 foreign policy and will have to address it head - on , " they argue			2
among the @entity92 , # merkelphone has gained some traction , with the famous @entity1 motif " @entity96 " finding a new interpretation			0
and the @entity25 media has begun to debate whether the revelations provided by @entity47 to @entity99 and other newspapers will do to @entity1 's image on the continent what the @entity104 war did to that of president @entity8			1
hyperbole perhaps , but the @entity1 administration is on the defensive , caught between fuller disclosure of just what the @entity36 has been up to and the need to protect intelligence - gathering methods			0
the president himself received what @entity2 officials describe as an angry call from @entity38 wednesday demanding assurances that there is no @entity22 eavesdropping on her conversations			2
the language out of the @entity124 has been less than forthright , with spokesman @entity125 saying that " the president assured the chancellor that the @entity22 is not monitoring , and will not monitor , the communications of the chancellor			2
" his careful avoidance of the past tense has heightened suspicions in @entity25 that only the @entity47 disclosures have forced a change of practice			1
even pro- @entity22 newspapers like the @entity136 are in full throttle , writing that : " the government in @entity83 has apparently not yet understood the level of damage that continues to be caused by the activities of @entity22 intelligence agencies in @entity25			1
" @entity43 reported that the @entity36 collected details of millions of phone calls made in @entity146 , and described it indignantly as " intrusion , on a vast scale , both into the private space of @entity146 citizens as well as into the secrets of major national firms			0
" @entity153 to summon @entity22 ambassador over spying allegations @entity146 prime minister @entity156 commented it was " incredible that an allied country like the @entity22 at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification , no justification on the basis of national defense			1
" the @entity22 director of national intelligence insisted in a curt statement that " the allegation that the @entity36 collected more than 70 million " recordings of @entity146 citizens ' telephone data " is false			2
" but president @entity1 called his @entity146 counterpart , @entity170 , and the @entity124 subsequently acknowledged the allegations had raised " legitimate questions for our friends and allies			2
" the fall - out may be more than rhetorical			0
@entity2 's opposition @entity175 are asking whether the @entity176 can -- or should -- agree a free trade deal with the @entity22 in the current atmosphere			1
negotiations on the @entity180 were already in a fragile state and will not be helped by claims in @entity43 that large @entity146 corporations such as telecom company @entity184 have been targeted by the @entity36			0
the @entity25 parliament has always been prickly about data - sharing with the @entity22 , and for years held up the @entity188 's efforts to use the @entity190 interbank apparatus to keep tabs on terrorists ' financial flows			1
the parliament this week passed a non-binding resolution calling for the agreement that was eventually reached to be suspended			0
and a parliamentary committee has agreed tough measures that would forbid @entity22 companies providing data services in @entity25 to transfer the information to the @entity22 without obtaining permission			1
the legislation must be agreed with member states , but for those hoping to get the provision deleted the wind is blowing in the wrong direction			0
not unlike the @entity211 disclosures , reports based on the @entity47 documents have caused embarrassment and friction around the world			2
president @entity215 of @entity216 cancelled a visit to the @entity22 after it was alleged that the @entity36 had intercepted her messages as well as communications from the state oil company , @entity220 , now one of the biggest players in the oil industry			2
@entity34 reported the @entity22 had also accessed emails to and from former @entity153 president @entity225 while he was still in office			2
@entity1 , in his address to the @entity229 last month , tried to head off the gathering storm - saying : " we 've begun to review the way that we gather intelligence , so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share			0
" @entity22 spy chief says reports of @entity36 logging @entity146 phone calls are false and there is a hint in the @entity22 response this week that , to borrow from @entity245 : " the lady doth protest too much			2
" the @entity36 itself has made the point that " the @entity22 gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations			2
" the @entity252 and @entity146 are among governments that run their own expansive technical programs			0
@entity34 reported -- again based on @entity47 's disclosures -- that the @entity252 equivalent of the @entity36 was involved in a cyber-attack against @entity260 's state - run telecommunications company , @entity259			1
the company would only say that " the intruder had massive resources , sophisticated means and a steadfast intent to break into our network			0
" the @entity25 have been very grateful to share the benefits of the @entity36 's immense data - gathering abilities in counter-terrorism and other fields			0
@entity22 diplomatic cables disclosed by @entity211 show @entity2 was enthusiastic in 2009 and 2010 for closer links with the @entity36 to develop what is known as a @entity275 ( @entity276 ) -- a highly advanced " constellation " of reconnaissance satellites			1
one cable from the @entity280 in @entity5 said : " @entity2 anticipates that their emergence as a world leader in overhead reconnaissance will generate interest from the @entity286 and envisions an expansion of the intelligence relationship			0
" the 9/11 attacks changed espionage beyond recognition , leading to massive investment in the @entity22 in " technical means " -- the flagship of which is the enormous @entity36 data center being completed in @entity296 , @entity297			1
its computing power , according to the specialist online publication @entity298 is " equivalent to the capacity of 62 billion @entity302			0
" but 9/11 also shifted the balance between intelligence - gathering and civil liberties , with the @entity22 federal government acquiring new powers in the fight against terrorism -- some sanctioned by @entity310 but others ill - defined			1
the technology that allows such enormous data - harvesting can not be put back in the box , but the limits to its use pose an equally huge challenge			0
ultimately , the @entity25 need to collaborate with the @entity22 on intelligence - gathering , to deal with international terrorism , cyber threats and organized crime			1
but the @entity47 allegations , whether reported accurately or not , have changed the public perception and mood in @entity25 , obliging leaders like @entity38 to take a tougher stand			1
at least there has been plenty of room for black humor amid the diplomatic back - and - forth			0
" @entity331 question : what do @entity25 leaders talk about that 's worth spying on ? " asked @entity333 's @entity332 on @entity334 , while @entity336 chief @entity335 quipped : " i 'm not sure i 'd want to listen in to @entity338 's cellphone			1

allegations of *surveillance* by @entity22 on @entity25 allies has strained relations
@entity22 ambassadors have been summoned in @entity40 and @entity5 to *explain* actions
many are asking if @entity176 can -- or should -- now agree free trade deal with the @entity22
@entity47 allegations changed mood in @entity25 , forcing leaders to take tougher line
