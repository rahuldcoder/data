-- tucked away in the @entity2 province of @entity3 for several weeks each autumn is the largest wild polar bear concentration in the world			1
an estimated 1,000 or so polar bears gather near the small town of @entity9 , waiting for @entity10 to freeze over so they can hunt seals and other marine mammals			1
this annual migration provides tourists , photographers and scientists from around the world the unique opportunity to view polar bears up close and personal			1
" the most inspiring element of this adventure is the opportunity to lock your gaze with a wild polar bear , " said @entity21 , the general manager of @entity22 , an outfitter that hosts tourists to the remote region each year			1
the bears are intriguing to watch			0
" each has his or her own personality -- just like humans , " said @entity32 of @entity33 , a nonprofit organization dedicated to the worldwide conservation of the polar bear			1
" some bears are shy , some are playful , while others are grouchy or aggressive			0
" there are some 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears around the world			1
polar bears top the food chain in the @entity47 , and people view them as a majestic symbol of the far north , said @entity32			1
yet despite their mighty presence , polar bears are listed as threatened under the @entity52 , with eight of the 19 polar bear subpopulations in decline , according to @entity55 , the executive vice president of @entity33			1
annual migration cycle of polar bears is changing each summer , the ice melts on @entity10 , forcing polar bears ashore			1
once on land , without access to seals and other marine mammals , the bears enter a state known as walking hibernation			0
they live off their fat reserves and spend most of the summer resting and conserving energy , said @entity71 , the chief scientist who studies the bears for @entity33			2
some polar bears will roam up to 900 miles along the coast in search of food , such as berries , grasses and kelp , but these do n't meet their nutritional needs , he said			2
as autumn approaches , the bears migrate back to the @entity9 region , where the annual freeze - up occurs sooner than elsewhere			2
as soon as the bay freezes , they scatter across the ice to hunt			0
the bears catch their prey from the surface of the sea ice			0
they remain there until the ice melts in summer and then the cycle repeats itself			0
over time , global warming and diminishing sea ice habitat have been the greatest threats to the bears , since this environment substantially reduces hunting opportunities , said @entity100			0
the ice has always melted each summer on @entity10 , forcing polar bears onto land			2
however , @entity100 said global warming has increased the amount of time the bears are separated from their main source of food , which is a problem			0
@entity33 reports in just 20 years , the ice - free period in @entity10 has increased by an average of 20 days , cutting short the bears ' seal hunting season , leaving them with little or nothing to eat			0
the @entity112 projects that two - thirds of polar bears will disappear by the year 2050 , as climate change melts sea ice			2
how to view the polar bears during migration the most accessible and safest place in the world for tourists to view wild polar bears is in the @entity123 during the autumn months , @entity32 said			1
" polar bears do gather in places like @entity127 's @entity126 to wait for freeze - up , but the tourism infrastructure is n't there , as it is in @entity9 , " he said			1
many tourists visit the polar bears via a tundra buggy , an all - terrain vehicle that provides a safe haven for polar bear viewing and photography			1
the experience is somewhat like going on an @entity47 safari , and only two tour operators in the area provide this service , @entity137 and @entity143			0
the buggies resemble wide buses , sit high off the ground , and are designed for the rugged conditions			0
the all - terrain vehicles move as fast as 5 miles per hour along a network of 24 miles of ungroomed and often rock - and snow - covered trails inside the @entity151			0
the buggies carry between 10 and 40 people at a time and a typical trip lasts about eight hours			0
sometimes , polar bears will walk right up to the buggies			2
" during their first interaction with a wild polar bear many guests are brought to tears , " said @entity21			1
" as a host , it 's really fulfilling for me to watch and feel our guests ' experiences with the bears			2
" the optimal time to view the wild polar bears is in october and november , when visitors can typically see between 10 and 30 polar bears a day			1
to reach the @entity9 area , most travelers fly or drive to @entity174 , the provincial capital , then catch a 620 - mile chartered or commercial flight north to @entity9			0
hotel rooms during the peak season average about $ 250 @entity178 per night			0
an all - inclusive package , including airfare , can range from $ 2,450 to $ 8,700 per person			0
for wildlife enthusiasts who ca n't make the trip to @entity3 , a live hd camera video feed of the polar bear migration ritual and other indigenous animals is available			1
starting this week and throughout the month of november , @entity0 / @entity188 in partnership with explore.org will stream live video from @entity9 of the polar bear migration			1
@entity193 is a nonprofit multimedia organization created to inspire lifelong learning			0
stream times will vary based on polar bear activity and news events of the day			2
@entity0 's first live stream will be tuesday , november 1 , at 4 p.m. et. users can check the schedule at @entity201 for future show times			2
" the polar bears are among the most magical of our planet 's endangered species , and much like the tigers of @entity210 , have come to represent the many consequences of global warming and industrialization , " said @entity203 , filmmaker and founder of @entity193			1
" by providing a window into their worlds , we are giving people a chance to come together to cherish the bears and an opportunity to share their plight in a compelling way			0
" @entity32 said the video project is a powerful way to inspire people to care about polar bears and their @entity47			1
" when you look into a polar bear 's eyes , it changes your life forever , " he said			1
" you want to do everything you can to save them			0
