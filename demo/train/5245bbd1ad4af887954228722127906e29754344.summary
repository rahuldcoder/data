-- @entity1 sacked coach @entity2 friday and replaced him immediately with @entity3			1
@entity2 departs after a dismal season for the famed @entity1 , who finished the season a lowly ninth in @entity8 and missed out on @entity10 competition			1
by contrast , @entity11 , who has been at @entity12 for four seasons , has guided them back into the @entity16 and they finished second to champions @entity18 in this year 's standings			0
he recently announced he would be leaving at the end of the season and was immediately linked with @entity1 , who will be appointing their sixth coach since the departure of @entity25 three years ago			2
@entity25 guided @entity1 to the @entity16 crown before joining @entity27 but his old charges have been in decline since that triumph			0
@entity2 was the latest to attempt to turn it around at the @entity32 , but despite the poor results club president @entity33 had kind words			0
" i 've chosen @entity3 , i 'm sorry for @entity2 , " he was quoted on the official @entity1 website			1
he added " that takes nothing away from the esteem i hold for @entity2 's talent and potential			0
" i 'm convinced he 'll become one of the great @entity45 coaches but it might also be necessary to save his professional future after a particularly unlucky year , and maybe he needs to find an easier situation than @entity1			0
" we 're coming to a difficult season and i thought we 'd need a coach with @entity3 's experience			2
" it has left @entity12 without a coach , but reports have strongly linked @entity56 with the vacant post after the @entity59 's interim spell at @entity60 ended with a @entity62 win			1
@entity56 was @entity25 's first successor at @entity1 , but was unable to repeat his success .			2
