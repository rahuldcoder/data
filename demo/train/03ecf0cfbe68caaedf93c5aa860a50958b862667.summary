@entity0 , @entity1 -- if every scientist hopes to make at least one important discovery in her career , then @entity7 professor @entity6 and her colleagues may have hit the jackpot			0
scientists have bred a new strain of flood - tolerant rice that could help feed millions			1
@entity16 's team works with rice , a grain most @entity19 take for granted , but which is a matter of life and death to much of the world			1
thanks to their efforts to breed a new , hardier variety of rice , millions of people may not go hungry			1
about half the world 's population eats rice as a staple			1
two - thirds of the diet of subsistence farmers in @entity35 and @entity36 is made up entirely of rice			1
if rice crops suffer , it can mean starvation for millions			2
" people [ in the @entity19 ] think , well , if i do n't have enough rice , i 'll go to the store , " said @entity16 , a professor of plant pathology at @entity7			2
" that 's not the situation in these villages			2
they 're mostly subsistence farmers			2
they do n't have cars			0
" as sea levels rise and world weather patterns worsen , flooding has become a major cause of rice crop loss			1
scientists estimate 4 million tons of rice are lost every year because of flooding			1
that 's enough rice to feed 30 million people			2
@entity61 is grown in flooded fields , usually to kill weeds			0
but rice plants do not like it when they are submerged in water for long periods , @entity16 said			0
" they do n't get enough carbon dioxide , they do n't get enough light and their entire metabolic processes are thrown off			0
the rice plant tries to grow out of the flood , but when it does , it depletes its sugar reserves			2
it starts to break down its chlorophyll , important for photosynthesis			0
it grows really quickly , and then when the flood recedes , it just dies			2
it 's out of gas			0
" normal rice dies after three days of complete flooding			1
researchers know of at least one rice variety that can tolerate flooding for longer periods , but conventional breeding failed to create a strain that was acceptable to farmers			1
so @entity16 and her colleagues -- @entity93 , senior scientist at the @entity94 in the @entity95 and @entity96 , professor of genetics at the @entity98 -- spent the last decade working to find a rice strain that could survive flooding for longer periods			1
@entity93 identified a flood - resistant gene 13 years ago in a low - yielding traditional @entity35 rice variety			1
he passed along the information to @entity16 , who isolated the gene , called @entity105 , and introduced it into normal rice varieties , generating rice that could withstand being submerged in water for 17 days			1
the team relied on something called precision breeding , the ability to introduce very specific genes into plants without the associated baggage of other genes that might tag along in conventional breeding			0
" this can be a problem for farmers , " @entity16 said			0
" the varieties that were developed from conventional breeding were rejected by farmers because they did n't yield well or taste good			0
" using precision breeding , scientists introduced the @entity105 gene three years ago into test fields in @entity36 and @entity35			1
the subsequent rice harvests were a resounding success			0
" the results were really terrific , " said @entity16			0
" the farmers found three - to five-fold increases in yield due to flood tolerance			1
they can plant the normal way			0
they can harvest the normal way and it tastes the same			0
farmers had more food for their families and they also had additional rice they could sell to bring a little bit of money into the household			2
" " the potential for impact is huge , " agreed @entity93 in a statement on the @entity94 web site			0
" in @entity36 , for example , 20 percent of the rice land is flood prone and the country typically suffers several major floods each year			1
submergence - tolerant varieties could make major inroads into @entity36 's annual rice shortfall			1
" the researchers anticipate that the flood - tolerant rice plants will be available to farmers in @entity36 and @entity35 within two years			1
because the plants are the product of precision breeding , rather than genetic modification , they are not subject to the same regulatory testing that can delay release of genetically modified crops			0
the @entity19 @entity168 conferred one of its highest research awards last december on @entity16 , @entity93 and @entity96 for their work on submergence - tolerant rice			1
but @entity16 has no plans to rest on her laurels			0
" i feel a great sense of gratitude that i was able to contribute in this way , " she said			0
" but the farmers have asked us , ' can you develop varieties that are drought tolerant , salt tolerant ? can you develop varieties that are insect resistant ? ' there are always more things to work on			2
" @entity2 's @entity188 contributed to this story .			0

scientists breed a new strain of flood - tolerant rice
normal rice dies after three days of complete flooding ; this rice can survive 17 days
new rice was successfully field - tested by farmers in @entity35 and @entity36
about half of the world 's population eats rice as a staple of its diet
