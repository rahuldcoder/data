-- the deepwater horizon oil spill has already claimed many victims -- from pelicans to oyster beds and precious marshland			2
but there may be one more : a species only just recently discovered			1
scientifically known as halieutichthys aculeatus , it is not a thing of beauty			0
but it lives an anonymous sort of existence on the seabed of the @entity20 , some 1,500 feet below the waves and -- like all marine life in the gulf -- plays its role in the food chain			1
its more digestible name is the @entity26 pancake batfish			1
and if oil stays deep under water , the gulf could lose it before it 's even officially recognized as a species			1
while scientists are uncertain what the long - range effects of the massive spill will be on the gulf 's delicate balance of life and death and its complex food chain , the little - known @entity26 pancake batfish is a case in point of one species whose very existence is in that balance			1
dr. @entity47 , an ichthyologist -- otherwise known as a fish biologist -- and assistant professor at @entity51 , found himself face - to - face with the little fish during a deep - sea trawl in the gulf with the university last fall			1
" we were lucky to get four or five specimen , " @entity47 said			0
" the variation we found was enough for me to be convinced that there was something new			0
" with a flat , round body resembling a pancake , as its name suggests , this species of batfish does n't really look like a fish			1
" if you make an oval between your thumb and forefinger , they 're about that big			0
their mouths and bulbous eyes are right in the front of their heads			0
you ca n't even see their faces if you look from above , " @entity47 said			0
not only does it look odd ; it also moves in mysterious ways			0
the @entity26 pancake batfish uses its foot - like fins , complete with an elbow , to push off the sea floor			1
flapping its tail , it swiftly hops across the sand			0
" they 're not like a flounder ; they are much more mobile , more like a pancake with feet			2
they 're bizarre for what they look like and how they behave , " @entity47 said			0
pancake batfish spend most of their days resting on the sandy bottom of the gulf			1
@entity47 says it 's impossible to tell how many of them are in existence			2
" during my trawl with @entity51 , we caught probably 100,000 fish and three of them were pancake batfish			1
it 's a hard thing to guess from that what their population is , but since they 're rare in museums , they 're probably rare in the wild , " @entity47 said			0
and although it 's not known exactly where they link into the food chain , he said tuna and marlin from the gulf have been found with @entity26 pancake batfish in their stomachs			1
even a possibility that one small species could disappear because of waters fouled by oil has scientists pondering what such an event would mean long - term for the gulf , and even beyond the gulf 's waters			1
" all of life on earth is a big book			0
all the extinct things are pages that are torn out of that book that muddle our history , " @entity47 said			0
he said what is most upsetting to him is that after 200 years of scientific study in the gulf , he estimates 98 percent of its marine life remains unknown			1
and with the @entity152 ' worst - ever environmental disaster still ongoing , could become unknown forever			2
" we know about commercial fish and shrimp			0
but there are 1,500 meters of question mark between the well head and the surface about the animal life and we really know very , very little			1
" we 're making a trade - off between two habitats and putting the more fragile one at risk			0
if we lose the [ pancake batfish ] , we 're losing a big part of evolutionary history , " @entity47 said			1
because it lives in the deep , the pancake batfish is not threatened by tar balls or the surface sheen of oil -- but by undersea oil plumes identified by researchers from the @entity173			1
on june 8 , the @entity174 confirmed that tests done by the @entity51 's researchers proved the existence of subsurface oil clusters			2
@entity179 continues to dispute the extent of the plumes			0
but @entity47 says this subspecies of batfish could be wiped out even if it does n't directly encounter oil			2
it lives on small invertebrates that are the foundation for the entire marine food chain in the gulf			2
and now it may be at risk of either losing its only source of food or ingesting an oil - coated dinner			2
@entity47 says that one ray of hope for the newly discovered species are the oil - consuming bacteria that thrive on crude oil			1
they use enzymes to metabolize the oil into two products ; new microorganisms and carbon dioxide			0
essentially , it is as if they are sucking the oil out of the water			2
dr. @entity213 , a professor at the @entity214 , recently returned from an expedition in the gulf to research the undersea plumes			0
while she acknowledged that the bacteria are certainly a good option for extracting oil from the water , she said they might not get the chance to do so			2
" at present , oxygen concentrations exceed 2 mg / l ( two milligrams per liter ) but if concentrations drop below that , it would spell problems for any oxygen - requiring organisms , " @entity213 wrote in a blog			0
and the oil - munching bacteria require oxygen to metabolize the oil			2
the bacteria also exist in much higher quantities at the surface of the gulf where there is sunlight and warmth			0
where this pancake batfish lives , at the very bottom , there are neither			1
" less than one percent of the microbial community in the gulf lives in the deep sea , " @entity47 says			1
" it is so cold down there , one to two degrees @entity248 , that they will move much more slowly to break down those micro-droplets of oil			0
" he is currently working on the original description of the @entity26 pancake batfish for the @entity253 and says it should be published by august			1
by the time it reaches an audience , though , the entry may not describe a species that is , but a species that was .			0

@entity26 pancake batfish lives 1,500 feet below surface
for deep - water denizens like pancake batfish , threat is from *underwater* oil plumes
one expert estimates that 98 percent of @entity20 's deep - water marine life remains unknown
scientists worry that extinction could come even before species are discovered
