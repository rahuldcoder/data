-- @entity1 on wednesday announced it was restricting access to a controversial video that has been blamed for inciting violence in @entity5 and protests in @entity7			1
the video , a film trailer mocking the @entity12 faith , will not be accessible via @entity1 in @entity5 and @entity7 , the company said in a statement issued to @entity0			1
" we work hard to create a community everyone can enjoy and which also enables people to express different opinions , " @entity1 said by e-mail			1
" this can be a challenge because what 's ok in one country can be offensive elsewhere			0
" this video -- which is widely available on the @entity24 -- is clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on @entity1			1
however , given the very difficult situation in @entity5 and @entity7 we have temporarily restricted access in both countries			1
" our hearts are with the families of the people murdered in yesterday 's attack in @entity5			1
" the video , a 14 - minute movie trailer that many view as an insult to @entity37 and their faith , was blamed for setting off a wave of violence in @entity5 and protests in @entity7 on tuesday and wednesday			1
an attack on a @entity44 consulate in the @entity5 city of @entity46 left the @entity44 ambassador and three other embassy staffers dead			1
president @entity49 strongly condemned the violence , calling the attack " outrageous			0
" mystery surrounds film cited in attacks @entity55 banned @entity1 in response to the video , according to reports			1
" we have been told to shut down @entity1 to the @entity55 public until the video is taken down , " @entity62 , from the country 's ministry of information and technology , told @entity63			1
the events raise what 's becoming a familiar question at a time when the @entity70 has become the world 's major medium of communication : when should websites that display user - generated content take down material that is deemed to be offensive ? this sort of debate comes up with some frequency			0
some people were outraged this year when @entity81 decided not to take down pages that supported the man accused of opening fire on moviegoers in a @entity87 theater			0
@entity1 also has been criticized for taking down videos showing police brutality and other acts of violence that could have political or journalistic significance			2
some of those videos were reposted by the site after further review			0
@entity1 's online guidelines ban pornography and " graphic or gratuitous violence " and ask the people who upload videos to respect copyright laws			1
on the subject of controversial speech , the site says , " we encourage free speech and defend everyone 's right to express unpopular points of view			0
but we do n't permit hate speech ( speech which attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin , religion , disability , gender , age , veteran status , and sexual orientation / gender identity )			0
" @entity120 , director for international freedom of expression at the @entity123 , said @entity1 should not take down the video worldwide but should consider blocking it in specific countries where it 's causing violence			1
reaction to anti-islam film fuels debate on free speech versus hate speech " is it good in the short term ? probably not , " she said of leaving the video online			2
" but for the long term and what it means for corporate free expression , yes , i think it 's good to keep it up			0
it 's a difficult balance			0
" the video could been seen as having news and documentary value , she said , potentially putting it in a category of videos that are allowed to stay on @entity1 even though they show , for example , drug use or violence -- acts that would violate @entity1 's terms if they were n't newsworthy			1
this clip probably would n't break @entity44 rules about inciting violence , @entity157 said , because it does not directly call for people to engage in violent acts			2
in a 2010 lecture at a human rights conference , @entity1 's @entity160 offers further details on how the site policies itself			1
with 72 hours of video being uploaded to @entity1 every minute , the site relies on its audience , employees and computer programs to address and sometimes delete content that is deemed to violate its terms			2
to be removed from @entity1 , a video first must be flagged by one of the site 's users			1
computers scan the clip for certain traits -- the first scan , she said , is for flesh - colored pixels -- and then prioritize the videos in a queue , @entity177 said			0
a group of @entity1 employees , who are positioned all over the world , then reviews the queue of flagged and computer - prioritized videos to judge them against @entity1 policy			2
" their job is to spend every single day looking at a queue of what i would define as the dark underbelly of the @entity70 , " @entity177 said in a video posted by the group @entity193			0
" so you 're going to see a lot of masturbation videos in that queue ; you 're going to see animal abuse			0
you 're going to see some pretty , pretty horrendous things			0
i would say the vast majority of flags we get are for things like pornography			0
" the film in question is considered offensive to @entity37 and depicts the @entity12 prophet @entity214 as a child molester , womanizer and killer			0
the video had about 55,000 views as of 11 a.m. et wednesday			0
it had a mostly unfavorable rating on @entity1 , with more than 8,000 " dislikes " to 2,600 " likes			0
" nearly 9,000 people had commented on the video , and several versions of it appeared to have been uploaded to @entity1			2
the 2 - month - old film trailer is in @entity228 , but it has been dubbed into @entity229			1
the @entity230 reports that an arabic - language version of the video was taken down from @entity1 , apparently for reasons of copyright infringement			2
@entity235 called the video " absurd " and " islamophobic			0
" the video also reportedly has been shown by means other than @entity1			2
part of the film was broadcast on @entity7 tv , according to the @entity230			2
