-- on september 11 , 2001 , when thousands of innocent men and women lost their lives , tens of thousands more came to their assistance			1
we as a nation saw greater acts of heroism than we could have imagined : first responders from all over @entity12 and all over the country came to ground zero to save lives , provide proper burial for lives that were lost and assist in the enormous effort to clean up and recover from that devastating attack on our nation			1
tragically , in the nine years since the attack , more than 30,000 responders and survivors from across the country have had to be medically treated because of their exposure to ground zero toxins			1
they are waiting for @entity27 to pass legislation to ensure that they can continue to get the care they need			1
our 9/11 heroes did n't think twice that day			1
bound by duty , a love of our nation and their fellow @entity35 , they joined hand in hand with heroes from every corner of @entity35 to come to our rescue			1
now , it 's long past time we came to theirs			2
nine years ago , no one could have imagined that our nation would ignore our duty to the 9/11 heroes			1
nine years ago , no one could have imagined that our country would leave these heroes behind			2
the @entity52 would finally provide monitoring and treatment for @entity56 responders and community members who are suffering , and for those who traveled to ground zero from all across @entity35			1
the legislation would establish the @entity60 within the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) to provide permanent medical monitoring and treatment for @entity56 - related conditions to responders and community members			1
the program administrator will establish a nationwide network of providers so that eligible individuals who live outside of the @entity12 area can reasonably access monitoring and treatment benefits where they live			1
these eligible individuals are included in the caps on the number of participants in the responder and community programs			2
one often overlooked aspect of the legislation is its level of accountability and transparency for the disbursement funds			0
it will terminate the six billing systems created in the chaotic aftermath of september 11 , and establish a third - party administrator , who will set reasonable rates , track expenditures and enforce eligibility requirements			0
and the legislation reopens the september 11 @entity93 to cover economic damages and losses for individuals who became ill after the original december 22 , 2003 deadline			0
the bottom line is that this should not be a partisan fight			0
we have an undeniable , moral obligation to provide our 9/11 heroes with all the care they need			1
heroes like @entity107 officer @entity106 , who died from @entity109 metastatic colorectal cancer caused by inhaling and swallowing toxins at ground zero			1
@entity106 worked many tours of duty at ground zero			1
he ate food and unknowingly inhaled toxic substances while working			0
at no time while working at ground zero was he instructed to wear a breathing apparatus , nor was he told that the air was unhealthy			2
@entity120 metastatic colorectal cancer is a form of cancer in the upper gi tract , and it is very rare to see it in a man so young			0
he was told that treatment would not cure him , only help him live longer			2
in his own words , he reacted to his diagnosis : " talk about crushing news ! my wife and i sat in the car and cried , and i asked her what did i ever do to deserve this			0
" on july 11th , 2006 , i had major surgery to remove two tumorous parts of my small colon and have radiation on the large tumor in my liver			0
before my surgery , i had four chemotherapy treatments , and was in the emergency room three times to be treated for dehydration before finally having to go on an all - liquid diet and intravenous feeding			2
" i have a wife , @entity149 , and two young children , @entity151 and @entity152 , who have seen my health worsen since participating in the @entity56 recovery			0
my favorite things in life are slowly being taken away from me			0
my work , food , helping others and caring for my family			0
" officer @entity106 died on july 28 , 2007			0
and the longer we delay this bill , the more heroes like @entity165 we risk losing			2
the @entity35 @entity166 passed this bill in september and now it 's time to keep our promise to 9/11 heroes and pass this bill in the @entity172			1
we ca n't afford to wait any longer			0
i 'm urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what they know is right and support this legislation			0
@entity180 leaders from around the country have stepped forward , including former @entity180 presidential candidates			0
former @entity12 mayor @entity183 said , " this is something that most @entity35 want			1
something that @entity180 like me want			0
these are people , after all , who were hurt and harmed because of the worst attack in the history of this country			0
they 're entitled to more consideration than this			0
" and former @entity192 gov. @entity191 said , " every @entity180 should vote for this bill			2
" the men and women who lived through and came to our rescue on 9/11 were not @entity198 or @entity180 or independents			2
they were @entity35 first and foremost , and so were the people they saved			1
it 's time for us in @entity27 to honor their sacrifices by coming together as @entity35 and keeping our promise to provide them with the care they need to save their lives			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			1

@entity210 : thousands lost lives on 9/11 , and tens of thousands came to help
first responders from all over @entity12 and the @entity35 came to ground zero , she says
@entity210 : 30,000 responders have been medically treated after exposure to toxins
