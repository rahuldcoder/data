-- the @entity1 , @entity3 's largest @entity2 political party , on thursday called for an international inquiry into a @entity6 failure to protect civilians during the final stages of the country 's bloody 26 - year civil war			1
the request comes a day after the @entity6 admitted that it did n't protect hundreds of thousands of civilians , mostly ethnic @entity12 , trapped in areas of heavy shelling in @entity3 , a teardrop - shaped island nation off @entity16 's southern coast			1
" the internal inquiry report that has now come to light says the @entity6 failed civilians by leaving the area , " @entity17 , the @entity1 parliamentarian , told @entity0			1
@entity17 was referring to the withdrawal of the @entity6 's international staff from north @entity3 's @entity24 area			1
in late 2008 , the government could no longer guarantee the safety of @entity6 staff there because of intense fighting between its forces and the @entity31 , or @entity31 , an armed separatist group commonly referred to as the @entity31			0
as the @entity6 prepared to leave , local civilians pleaded with it to stay , fearing the government would bomb areas where there were no international witnesses			2
in the report released wednesday , the @entity6 questioned its decision to move its staff " because of a government safety warning when government forces themselves represented the dominant threat to staff			2
" the @entity6 also acknowledged that it had , on occasion , " omitted to explicitly mention government responsibility for violations of international law " so as to not hinder its humanitarian access in the country			0
the internal review published accounts in which @entity6 officials emphasized grave responsibility for civilian deaths with the @entity31 but only " raised concerns " with the @entity3 government			1
the government of @entity3 declared victory in 2009 in its decades - long battle with the @entity31 rebels , who had waged war for an independent state for minority tamils in @entity3 since july 1983			2
as many as 70,000 people were killed in the conflict			0
caught in the crossfire year after year were civilians , thousands of whom were displaced and hundreds killed			0
in the war 's final stage , which lasted from september 2008 to may 2009 , the @entity3 army advanced into an area of northern @entity3 known as the @entity24 , where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting			1
a @entity6 report in 2011 said the government used " large - scale and widespread shelling " that left large numbers of civilians dead			1
in its report this week , the @entity6 admitted to withholding the large number of civilian casualties it had recorded from diplomatic corps in the country			0
though the @entity6 says it made taciturn criticism of the government so that it could negotiate pauses in fighting to allow civilians to escape and for it to gain access to internally displaced people , the efforts were made in vain because , as wednesday 's report said , the @entity6 was never in a position to reach those displaced people			1
the number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day , and @entity6 figures greatly differ from those in reports from @entity3 's government and other nongovernmental organizations			1
" the report concludes that the @entity6 system failed to meet its responsibilities , " @entity6 secretary - general ban ki - moon said in a statement thursday			0
the @entity6 report concludes by stating : " the @entity6 's failure to adequately respond to events like those that occurred in @entity3 should not happen again			1
when confronted by similar situations , the @entity6 must be able to meet a much higher standard in fulfilling its protection and humanitarian responsibilities			0
" however , @entity17 says there is more work to be done before moving on			0
" that does not mean that it is a lesson for the future for the @entity6			0
the @entity6 should revisit the events that took place during the final stages of the war in may 2009 , where both the @entity31 rebels and the security forces are accused of committing war crimes , " he said			0
" if the @entity6 has made a mistake , they must pursue that course of action			0
" the @entity3 government had no immediate official response to the @entity6 report			2
@entity0 's @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity3 , contributed to this report .			2
