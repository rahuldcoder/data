-- the videos and photographs are numbered in the dozens , every one of them telling a fragment of a terrible story : toddlers breathing their last gasp , the bodies of children laid out in rows and covered in blocks of ice , their faces pale and expressionless			1
elsewhere , dozens of white shrouds appear to hold the corpses of adults , the names of the victims written hurriedly on the cloth			2
there was some sort of ghastly event in the suburbs of @entity25 early on wednesday : the sheer volume of material uploaded within a short time span and the consistent testimony of medical staff attest to that			1
but there are as many questions as answers			2
the victims showed no sign of injury ; there was none of the bloodshed associated with artillery attacks , no wounded , dust - covered people being dug from buildings reduced to ruins			2
it was impossible to know how many had died and exactly where or why			0
by the end of the day , the @entity47 were reporting that more than 1,300 people had been killed in areas around @entity25 , some 400 in the neighborhood of @entity52 alone			0
even by the standards of @entity56 's remorseless conflict , that would represent a catastrophic day			1
but there was no way to verify such figures : mass burials began within hours , and of course , there was no access to the area for independent observers			0
mistrust between @entity67 , @entity56 rebels hinders military aid accusations fly opposition activists almost immediately alleged president @entity72 's regime had used chemical weapons against districts long controlled by rebel groups			1
it is not the first such allegation ; some activists were soon claiming the regime had used sarin , a nerve agent that it is widely thought to possess			1
residents spoke of dizziness and choking , convulsions and difficulty breathing , which would be consistent with the symptoms of sarin poisoning			0
but some victims appeared to have died in their sleep , undisturbed , according to local reports			0
the @entity56 government dismissed the claims of chemical weapons being used as " disillusioned and fabricated			1
" some opposition activists say the toxin used may have been " agent 15 , " also known as @entity98			1
its full name is 3 - quinuclidinyl benzilate , and it affects both the peripheral and central nervous systems			0
the opposition claimed that @entity98 was used in tank shells fired in the city of @entity107 last december			0
a doctor in the city told the online publication " @entity111 " soon after that the victims " all had miosis -- pinpoint pupils			0
they also had generalized muscle pain			0
there were also bad symptoms as far as their central nervous system			0
there were generalized seizures , and some patients had partial seizures			0
" @entity124 , a non-governmental organization , says that @entity98 induces a " severely altered mental status ( hallucinations , giddiness , confusion ) ; lack of secretions -- dry mucous membranes , dry mouth , eyes , skin ; dilated pupils , blurred vision , nausea , vomiting			0
" but the reports from @entity107 , like so many of the allegations to emerge from @entity56 , were never confirmed			1
the next month , the @entity139 said it had " found no credible evidence to corroborate or to confirm that chemical weapons were used " in @entity107			1
some experts doubt the @entity72 regime possesses @entity98			1
perhaps more significant is an account from the spring of this year , when @entity150 from the @entity152 newspaper @entity151 spent weeks in and around @entity153 , the opposition - held district on the edge of @entity25 that saw many of the casualties early wednesday			1
" no odor , no smoke , not even a whistle to indicate the release of a toxic gas , " he reported " and then the symptoms appear			0
their eyes burn , their pupils shrink , their vision blurs			0
soon they experience difficulty breathing , sometimes in the extreme ; they begin to vomit or lose consciousness			0
" " the people who arrive have trouble breathing , " a doctor told @entity151			0
" they 've lost their hearing , they can not speak , their respiratory muscles have been inert			0
if we do n't give them immediate emergency treatment , death ensues			0
" " in @entity153 , the fighters did not desert their positions , but those who stayed on the front lines -- with constricted pupils and wheezing breath , " @entity150 reported			0
@entity56 refugees stream into @entity182 outsiders unsure of the cause independent experts who studied wednesday 's videos were unsure of the cause			1
@entity188 , editorial director at the magazine @entity189 -- which reports on chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or explosives use -- analyzed the videos and wrote on the magazine 's site : " clearly respiratory distress , some nerve spasms and a half - hearted washdown ( involving water and bare hands ? ) , but it could equally be a riot control agent as a ( chemical warfare agent )			1
" the allegations that some sort of chemical weapons were used came amid an ongoing government assault on rebel - held areas around @entity25 - such as @entity209 and @entity210 - with artillery and air strikes further complicating the picture			1
the @entity56 military 's goal is to push the rebels back , thereby reducing mortar attacks on the heart of the capital			1
that offensive continued wednesday , according to opposition activists in @entity153 and @entity222			2
some analysts speculated that a stockpile of chemical agents may have been hit by shelling , whether controlled by the rebels or the regime			1
but that would not explain the number of neighborhoods -- some several miles apart -- where the same symptoms were reported among victims			0
@entity235 chemical weapons inspectors in @entity25 there is also the question of motive and timing , if regime forces were responsible			2
just a few miles from those terrible scenes , a team of @entity235 chemical weapons inspectors -- led by a well - qualified @entity243 -- were asleep at their hotel			2
@entity246 -- an ally of the @entity72 regime -- made that point immediately			1
a @entity251 statement from @entity252 noted that " the criminal act was committed near @entity25 at the very moment when a mission of @entity235 experts had successfully started their work of investigating allegations of the possible use of chemical weapons there			1
" but the terms of the inspectors ' visit are tightly prescribed ; they are only permitted to visit three sites where chemical weapons are alleged to have been used in the past			2
government forces did not appear to be in imminent danger of being overrun by rebel factions in the areas concerned ; in fact , many observers believe a bloody stalemate has set in around @entity25			2
and regime forces have also made gains recently against rebels around @entity107 and elsewhere			2
why would it risk an action that would likely kill hundreds in a heavily - populated area and risk stirring up an international appetite for intervention ? would it also have risked using an agent as lethal as sarin just a few kilometers from the heart of @entity25 -- to both the southwest and northeast of the city -- on what appears to have been a quite windy night ? the @entity290 believes the @entity56 government was the most likely culprit			1
" we have seen with grave concern the reports of the possible use of chemical weapons by the @entity56 regime , said the @entity290 's @entity300 chief , @entity299			1
" such accusations should be immediately and thoroughly investigated			2
" the @entity302 made a very similar statement			0
in a familiar ritual , @entity246 quickly pointed the finger at rebel forces , alleging that " a homemade rocket , analogous to that which was used by terrorists on the 19th of march in @entity311 , containing a so - far - undefined poisonous substance , was launched from positions held by the fighters " early on wednesday morning			2
the incident in @entity311 , near @entity316 , was reported to have left 19 people dead			0
some observers also point to claims on jihadist websites that rebels have seized chemical weapons equipment after overrunning government bases such as one outside @entity316 in july 2012			1
supporters of the @entity72 government claim that wednesday 's reports are very convenient for the opposition as it tries to spur the international community to action just as events in @entity332 have claimed the front pages			1
little hope for change @entity336 , president of the @entity337 , an umbrella group of @entity72 opponents , said in @entity339 : " it 's not the first time in which the regime used chemical weapons ... but it presents a move by the regime , because they are doing it with impunity ...			1
the @entity235 will be puzzled , and the @entity67 will announce more red lines , and will leave it in the air			0
" given the stated positions of the great powers , an emergency meeting of the @entity353 seems unlikely to prompt decisive international action			0
perhaps the world will never know whether the events of august 21 , 2013 , around @entity25 amounted to the most widespread use of chemical agents since @entity360 's bombardment of the @entity362 town of @entity363 25 years before			1
@entity0 's @entity364 contributed to this report .			2

videos of suffering and dying @entity56 suggest a chemical attack , but verification is difficult
@entity72 's government , rebels trade accusations , denials about event on wednesday
outside experts are unsure if there was a chemical attack , and if so , what agent was used
