-- facing growing global pressure over rising violence in his country , @entity3 's embattled president had little choice but to accept a @entity10 special envoy 's peace proposal , analysts said tuesday			1
" he has nothing to lose , and he has something to gain , and that is that he can potentially slow down the process of international isolation that is taking place , " said @entity11 , an associate professor at the @entity12 who writes a daily newsletter analyzing events in @entity3			1
@entity3 president @entity28 and his government " understand that this is truly their last opportunity to hang on to power , " said @entity22 , a @entity3 - born scholar at the @entity23 in @entity24			1
" they can not mess any more with the international community , lest they create a unified front against them , " @entity22 said			0
nations watching @entity3 after it accepts peace plan timing was likely a key factor in the @entity3 government 's response this week to special envoy @entity43 's six - point plan , analysts said			1
@entity45 secretary of state @entity44 and other global leaders are expected to discuss ways to assist the @entity3 opposition at a " @entity51 " meeting in @entity50 sunday			2
" ( @entity52 ) wants to slow that down , and by accepting this peace plan , it makes it difficult for @entity56 to announce further measures while the @entity10 is carrying out a negotiation , " @entity11 said			0
@entity43 called @entity3 's agreement " an important initial step			1
" but analysts cautioned that the next steps the @entity3 government and members of the opposition will take are unclear -- and crucial in deciding the nation 's future			2
@entity43 's six - point plan @entity70 , a senior fellow for @entity72 studies at the @entity73 , said @entity3 's agreement to @entity43 's plan is a " fraud " aimed at buying time			1
" they can keep on negotiating and drag this out , because with every passing week they kill more dissidents			0
i think what the regime is hoping is they can crush all of this before anybody moves to help the opposition , " he said			0
@entity89 officials , who met with @entity43 to discuss his plan over the weekend , likely encouraged @entity3 to sign on , @entity70 said			1
" the @entity89 have been talking about ending the violence , and it would be logical that they would advise @entity28 to talk a good game , and not to reject it , but rather to use it to gain more time , " @entity70 said			1
along with @entity97 , @entity89 -- a long - time ally of @entity28 -- has vetoed recent @entity10 resolutions to condemn @entity28 and his government 's crackdown on anti-government protests			1
" what the @entity89 have done is signaled that , ' look , you have one opportunity , you 'd better make it count			2
' because it 's not clear to anyone at the international level that the @entity89 and the @entity97 are willing to press along with @entity28 indefinitely			1
" said @entity109 , a visiting fellow at the @entity110			0
some analysts said a key difference in @entity43 's plan made it more palatable to the @entity3 government : it does n't require @entity28 to leave office			1
" previous efforts have been to get president @entity28 to agree to step down and initiate some kind of transfer of power from him to revolutionaries			2
@entity43 , of course is not asking that , " @entity11 said			0
" he is turning to the @entity97 and @entity89 and hoping to draw them in and just stop the fighting , with @entity28 staying in power			2
" @entity109 described @entity43 's plan as " fundamentally different in ways that signal a willingness to step back from the brink			1
" in addition to allowing @entity28 to stay in power , @entity43 's plan also criticizes both sides for the violence , @entity109 said			1
but allowing @entity28 to stay in power is an option opposition leaders are n't likely to support , @entity22 said			0
" something that is more serious would be , perhaps , a political dialogue in which @entity28 accepts to step down in order to form a transitional government			0
... this is like having a political dialogue with @entity144			0
how does one have a political dialogue with another party that has a gun to the head of a civilian population ? " @entity22 said			0
the @entity3 government " is simply playing for time , " said former @entity45 ambassador to @entity3 @entity151			0
" it will talk the talk of cooperation with the international community , but not walk the walk on the actual requirements that are necessary , such as really ceasing the use of lethal force against its own people in the streets of @entity3 , " said @entity151 , director of @entity154 's @entity153			2
but even if the @entity3 government is just stalling for time , that does n't mean negotiations should stop , @entity109 said			0
" the reality is the alternative is to do nothing , and the alternative is to let a protracted crisis become a regional nightmare , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
