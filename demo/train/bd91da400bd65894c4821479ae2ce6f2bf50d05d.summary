-- two different terror attacks by two different sets of @entity4 extremists in two different democracies			2
but the difference in people 's responses is what 's key , and exemplifies why @entity10 truly is exceptional			1
i 'm referring to the bombing in @entity13 , @entity14 , on april 15 and the attack on a @entity17 soldier on a @entity19 street on may 22			1
after the @entity13 attack , which claimed the lives of three people and injured more than 250 others , a minor @entity21 backlash was reported			1
the most notable : a @entity27 man in @entity28 was allegedly beaten and a @entity30 woman in @entity13 was struck in the shoulder and called a terrorist			1
and sure the professional @entity33 , who make their living spewing hate , came out to sell their rancid goods of division and distrust			2
however , thankfully , and unsurprisingly , @entity10 were n't buying it			1
but in @entity42 , the backlash against @entity17 @entity30 has been alarming			1
since the terror attack on may 22 , there have been 193 @entity21 incidents in @entity42 , that 's 15 times the average number			1
these hate crimes ranged from vandalizing mosques to pulling off women 's headscarves , to threats of violence against @entity30 and to minor assaults			2
one of the most serious incidents happened sunday night when three firebombs were thrown at the @entity56 in @entity57 , while worshipers were inside in the mosque			0
luckily no one was killed			0
according to @entity17 media reports , this wave of @entity21 fever was not spontaneous			0
it has been an organized campaign of hate led by the right - wing group @entity66 , which held protests on the streets of @entity19 and @entity69 this past weekend			0
at its @entity19 event , @entity66 's leader @entity70 told supporters : " they 've had their arab spring			0
this is time for the @entity42 spring			1
" of course , the terrorists who killed the @entity17 soldier were of @entity79 heritage , not @entity80			2
but then again , bigots are n't the brightest , whether they 're @entity42 or @entity10			1
obviously , the @entity21 attacks and rallies orchestrated by the @entity66 do n't represent mainstream @entity17 society			0
in fact , an anti-racism rally was held in @entity19 to counter the @entity66 's march			0
and comedian and actor @entity88 wrote a heartfelt column for the @entity17 's popular @entity92 tabloid , imploring his fellow brits to remain tolerant and not blame all @entity30 for the sins of two madmen			0
another bright spot : at a smaller @entity66 protest in @entity98 , @entity30 invited the protesters into their mosque and found some common ground in a properly @entity17 way , with tea and cookies and an impromptu game of soccer			0
but why did n't we see an angry @entity21 backlash in the @entity10 after the @entity13 bombings killed and injured so many more people ? a few reasons			1
not only did the @entity10 - @entity30 community quickly denounce the @entity13 bombing , but people of other faiths publicly stood with @entity10 - @entity30 , including @entity117 and @entity118 leaders in the @entity13 area			1
do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying all @entity10 love @entity30			1
but there 's a difference between not feeling too warmly about a minority group and actually advocating discrimination and hatred and committing violence against them			0
but the bigger reason we did n't see a backlash like the one in @entity42 has to do with who we are as @entity10			1
our nation 's dna can be found on the words affixed to the seal of the @entity10 : " @entity136 " which means " out of many , one			1
" to most @entity10 , @entity137 and @entity138 both , these words are more than rhetoric			2
it 's the promise our @entity141 offered , to welcome people from all different backgrounds to become one with us as @entity10			2
@entity10 was , and still remains , a melting pot. and since its creation , that melting pot has grown ; it has become bigger , more colorful and more vibrant			1
sure , some are troubled by our increasing diversity			0
we see it in the angry rhetoric from those on the far right toward those who do n't look , pray or act like them			2
and we regrettably see it in the hate crimes perpetrated against people simply because they are different			0
we need to look no further than @entity28 , the " bluest " city in the " bluest state , " to see a spike in reports of hate crimes against gays , with 29 so far this year compared with 14 last year			0
@entity163 , a gay man , was killed on may 18 while he was walking the streets of @entity165			0
@entity163 was murdered simply because of his sexual orientation			0
we may never be able to end all hate crimes in a nation of more than 300 million people			0
but we must remain vigilant in countering the voices of intolerance and hatred			0
the reaction to the @entity13 bombings , in such marked contrast to @entity42 's reaction to the killing of the soldier , shows we are on the right path			1
by staying on this path , we will ensure that the @entity10 remains truly exceptional			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity182 : *anti-muslim* backlash in @entity42 was severe after a soldier was slain
in comparison , he says , the backlash in the @entity10 after the @entity13 bombings was minor
he says @entity193 denounced the act and other faiths stood with them
also , he says , the melting pot and " out of many , one " make up our identity
