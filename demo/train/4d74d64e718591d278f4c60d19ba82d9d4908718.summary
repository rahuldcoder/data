-- a mini metropolis of teepees sprawls across the parched plains , and in the early hours of the morning the first to rise are the children			2
they have an important job to do			0
" we 'd wake up in those teepees , and we were pretty happy to slip the bridles off the horses and ride bareback to the river , " remembers @entity7 , today a man of 58			1
" we 'd take the horses to the river to drink water -- that was our first job as young boys			2
" each august , the rolling hills surrounding @entity20 in @entity21 are transformed into the " teepee capital of the world , " with over a thousand tents and hundreds of horses converging for the @entity26 and @entity27			1
started over a century ago in 1904 , the four - day festival is one of the largest gatherings of @entity31 in the country , with spectacular traditional costumes casting a luminous kaleidoscope of color beneath a brilliant blue sky			1
it 's also an important training ground for the next generation of rodeo stars			0
" it 's one of the largest @entity31 rodeos within the @entity45 , " explained @entity7 , who today teaches youngsters how to hold on for dear life in the arena			1
" we 've had quite a few young @entity31 men that have ridden here , gone into professional rodeo , and become world champions			1
" real - life horse whisperers indeed , if you thought the world of rodeo was simply that of the white cowboy , think again			2
there is another master of the saddle , one who has honed their horsemanship over hundreds of years			1
" @entity31 have a special relationship with horses because it was a way of life , " said @entity7 's uncle , 78 - year - old @entity63 , also of the @entity65 tribe			1
" my family were known for their ability to ride bucking horses			2
there was a mastery to how they could ride a horse -- it involved timing , balance , " said @entity63 , each word tumbling out slow and deep			0
outside the rodeo ring however , there 's another sport taking place at @entity26 -- and it 's as fast and furious as they come			0
@entity31 relay in the world of @entity31 relay fearless jockeys race bareback around an oval track three times , leaping from horse to horse while still in motion			1
at the end of each lap the rider jumps from their first horse , hits the ground running , then climbs onto the back of their next horse for the following lap. " it 's more or less carried on from the warrior days of old , when they would go and invade enemy camps and make off with their horses , " said @entity63 , who took part in his first relay when he was just 16			2
" today , white people might call it stealing			0
but back at the time it was a mark of bravery and courage to enter the camps , knowing you could meet your end			0
" the adrenalin - fuelled relay takes place without helmets , saddles , or goggles , and @entity124 is philosophical about the risks			1
" there 's a lot of danger in anything you do , " he says evenly			0
" but there 's the courage of the participants and the determination to master whatever it is they do			0
" colorful crow as the sun sets , the evening pow wow begins , the sounds of traditional singing and dancing flowing through the campsite			1
riders do n't just pack their horse saddles for the annual fair -- they include their dancing outfits and drums too			1
" during the day they 'd do the races and rodeos , and then in the evenings they took part in a pow wow , " said @entity7 , about a tradition stretching back 100 years			0
" they 'd talk their own language , and they knew the @entity162 songs			0
" and once the boisterous nightly celebrations have given way to sleep , the children will be the first to stir in their teepees come the dawn			0
