-- may 21 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity14 , @entity15 : we know that fridays are awesome , but you know what today 's show could use ? a mascot ! and we 've got one coming up for you in about eight minutes			1
let 's get to it			1
first up : @entity26 @entity27 : first up , top kill			1
it sounds like something pretty bad			1
officials are hoping it 'll do something good , though : stop the oil leak in the @entity35			1
the top kill -- it 's also called a " dynamic kill " -- is something we mentioned earlier this week			1
you basically clog up the well with a special kind of mud			1
@entity45 , the company that owns the well , has been trying a bunch of ways to deal with this leak			1
one strategy is using dispersants , chemicals that help break up the oil			1
the @entity54 is worried about the specific kind of chemical that 's being used			1
it 's ordered @entity45 to start using a different dispersant in the next couple days			1
the @entity58 is part of the @entity61 @entity60			2
it 's in charge of regulating offshore oil drilling			1
it 's gotten some criticism lately for being too close to the industry it 's supposed to oversee			1
there 've been accusations of improper gifts or improper behavior			2
@entity73 is the secretary of the interior			2
he 's in charge of the @entity60			1
he says he 's working to clean up the @entity58 , and he 's keeping an eye on the different strategies to clean up this oil spill			1
@entity73 , secretary of @entity61 @entity60 : if something does n't work , you need to immediately fall back to other alternatives			2
we , every day , are on top of @entity45 , relative to the different work streams that they have going on			2
this particular work stream that they call the dynamic kill is something that should come , according to their schedule , in play on sunday			2
that will be an effort to essentially kill the well through the insertion of mud			1
we 're doing everything we can to hold @entity45 accountable , and we will hold them accountable on behalf of the @entity61 people			2
blog report @entity27 : you 've been talking about what you think the worst part of the oil spill is ; most of you have discussed its impact on marine life			2
listen to what @entity110 says : " the thing that will be affected most is the fishing industry			2
if oil spilled near my town , it would ruin the economy because about 90 percent of it is fishing			2
" from @entity123 : " our seafood will become more expensive , and i 'm not ready to cut back on my favorite food just yet			2
" @entity124 says " this spill is becoming eerily similar to the @entity125 back in 1989			2
once we get this cleaned up , " he says , " we 're gon na be reluctant to build another oil rig			2
" @entity128 thinks " we should get neighboring countries to try to help us in such a bad ecological crisis			2
" @entity131 notes that " ocean life is the base of the food chain ; when we pollute the oceans , we are affecting ourselves too			2
" and @entity136 says " it 's obvious the fishing industry is taking a hit			1
the disaster will damage hundreds of years worth of marine life and the ecosystem			2
" economy check @entity27 : we have a quick look at some economic headlines for you now , starting with a drop in the @entity149			2
the @entity149 dropped 376 points yesterday			2
not good news ; the @entity149 indicates how the whole stock market is doing			1
some experts argue that the debt crisis that 's happening over in @entity155 is making investors nervous , and that 's causing some of the declines in the @entity61 market			1
next up , jobless claims			2
we 're talking about the number of people who are filing for unemployment for the first time			2
the number went up last week for the first time in a month			2
and finally , a @entity168 reform bill is moving forward in the @entity169			2
yesterday , they voted 60 to 40 to end debate and have a final vote on the bill			0
that could happen within days			0
is this legit ? @entity175 , @entity15 : is this legit ? the @entity176 is off the coast of the @entity178			0
actually , it 's next to the @entity4			1
the @entity178 is in @entity155			0
@entity4 tensions @entity27 : it 's the @entity4 that 's getting a lot of attention right now because of something that happened in the @entity176 back in march			1
a mysterious explosion tore a @entity4 warship in half			0
it was near part of the @entity176 that both @entity191 and @entity192 say belongs to them			0
several countries -- including @entity192 and the @entity61 -- investigated the incident			0
the results point the finger at @entity198 , that a @entity198 submarine launched a torpedo that sank the @entity4 ship			0
the @entity191 denied the accusation			0
the @entity4 vowed to respond			0
here 's why all of this is important			1
the @entity61 has an agreement with @entity192 to defend it against any aggression			0
so , if a military conflict breaks out , the @entity61 will have to get involved			0
the tension on the @entity4 goes back decades			0
the @entity211 , fought from 1950 to 1953 , killed millions of people on both sides			0
when it ended , the @entity214 -- or @entity215 -- was established as a kind of barrier between the two countries			0
@entity219 takes us there now			0
( begin video ) @entity223 , @entity0 correspondent : we 're on @entity224 driving towards the @entity214			1
it splits the @entity191 from @entity192 , and it 's been described once by former president @entity226 as the scariest place on earth			1
after the @entity211 , a line was drawn at the 38th parallel , two - and - a - half miles wide , cutting 155 miles across			0
the @entity215 was set up as part of a truce in 1953 , but no peace treaty was ever finalized			0
so , the two koreas are technically still at war			0
here , the @entity236 lives			0
this is the joint security area in the truce village of @entity239			1
this is a very highly controlled part of the @entity215 , and only certain soldiers and military officers are allowed here			0
this is one of the conference rooms where the @entity246 command led by the @entity61 would meet with the @entity198 , and they would discuss all matters regarding the border and the armistice			1
these mikes record everything in this room , and they also happen to be right on the demarcation line			0
so , if i cross over here , i 'm in @entity198			0
there are reminders of the hostilities			0
over there is the @entity198 side of the demarcation line			0
and the prisoners of war , after the @entity211 , were brought here and told to choose a side			0
once you cross this bridge , you could never go back			0
this is the only place where you 're going to see @entity4 and @entity198 soldiers staring each other down			1
the @entity4 soldiers are chosen for their stature , so they look more intimidating			0
they also are highly trained in martial arts , hence the @entity278 stance			0
what 's so surreal about this place is that it 's become a tourist attraction for both sides			1
we were just with a tour of @entity61 war veterans , and over here , the @entity198 are holding their own tour			0
and 60 years on , we 're still waiting for peace			0
( @entity290 ) address to @entity292 @entity27 : @entity294 president @entity293 wrapped up his trip to the @entity61 with a speech to a joint meeting of the @entity292			0
on wednesday , he and president @entity298 talked about some of the issues that affect both of their countries			0
president @entity293 brought up those same concerns in his speech yesterday			0
he pointed out the benefits of working together			0
@entity294 president @entity293 : @entity294 and the @entity61 are stronger together than they are apart			0
together , we can renew our partnership to restore stronger and faster economic growth on both sides of the border			0
a stronger @entity294 means a stronger @entity61			0
@entity313 @entity314 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to ms. @entity317 's intervention class at @entity318 in @entity319 , @entity320 ! in what city would you find @entity323 , @entity324 and part of the @entity326 ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity6 , b ) @entity330 , c ) @entity331 or @entity332 ) @entity333 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity6 , the capital of the @entity7 , is home to all of these famous landmarks			1

they 're the mascots for the @entity341 and @entity342			1
we promised you a mascot ; we never said it 'd be recognizable			1
@entity6 is hosting the @entity341 , and it unveiled the face of the games this week : @entity349 -- that 's the thing on the left -- and @entity349			1
the designer that came up with these guys says they were inspired by the steel that was used to build @entity6 's olympic stadium			1
he designed them specifically for kids , and says he hopes that the mascots will help connect young people with sports and the legacy of the @entity363			0
before we go @entity27 : well , before we go , you 've heard of the leaning tower of @entity367 ? this is the leaning press box of @entity369			0
that 's leaning pretty far			1
do n't worry about it ; it 's not a disaster			1
it 's a demolition ! the stadium 's being torn down , or pulled down , in this case			1
the @entity377 and @entity378 are moving into a new home next door , and the old stadium 's spot is being turned into a parking lot			1
goodbye @entity27 : so , you 've got demolition , you 've got a parking lot			0
sounds like it requires car - ful planning			0
you guys keep standing tall ; the weekend 's just hours away			1
we 'll see you on the other side of it			0
