-- the 2020 @entity1 will be staged in cities across the continent , rather than just in one host nation , @entity5 's executive committee decided on thursday			1
dubbing the tournament " a @entity10 " , @entity9 football 's governing body has ensured the competition will firmly break with tradition as it celebrates what will be its sixtieth year			0
since their inception in 1960 , the @entity1 have been regularly staged by just one country -- with three tournaments having been co-hosted ( 2000 , 2008 and 2012 )			0
" let me say that it is a decision only about 2020 , " @entity5 general secretary @entity17 told his organization 's website			1
" 2020 is the 60th anniversary of the @entity22			1
" " it is premature to go into more details			0
what is clear is that it will not be in one or two countries , but in several cities in @entity9			0
how many cities is still to be decided			0
" in june , @entity5 president @entity30 was quoted as saying the tournament could be staged in 12 - 13 cities			1
on thursday , @entity17 added that the bidding process for host cities will start early next year and is expected to take around 12 months , with a decision expected in 2014			1
all but one of @entity5 's 53 member nations supported the idea , with @entity39 -- which had initially bid to host the 2020 finals alongside @entity41 and @entity42 -- the lone dissenting voice			1
the @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 have already expressed interest in staging matches , with the latter @entity49 stating that it " fully supports @entity5 's decision and continues to explore avenues by which to bring the @entity5 tournament to @entity46 " on its website			1
the @entity5 general secretary also explained that there was a strong possibility that not all the host countries would qualify for the tournament , saying this was something that would be " thought about and looked at "			2
the idea of spreading the tournament across the continent was first mooted after this year 's @entity1 by @entity30 , who suggested it as a way of avoiding high costs at a time of financial uncertainty in many countries			1
fiscal concerns became of greater importance after @entity5 chose to expand the tournament from 16 to 24 teams , the number that @entity74 will host when the country stages the next finals in 2016			2
" obviously the fact that the ( championships ) will feature 24 teams instead of 16 puts an additional burden on countries to host such an event , " said @entity17			0
" it becomes much more difficult for many countries -- the requirements are becoming bigger and bigger			0
" an opportunity like this , to give many cities and many countries the possibility to host even just one part of a @entity92 , is certainly an excellent thing , especially in times when you have an economic situation where you can not expect countries to invest in facilities in the way that such an event requires			2
" certainly one of the purposes of this decision is to help countries , who are perhaps not sure today whether they should build a national stadium -- giving them the impetus to build such a stadium			0
" instead of having a party in one country , we will have a party all over @entity9 in the summer of 2020			0
" reigning champions @entity113 will have the chance to defend their title at the 2016 @entity1 , when @entity74 will stage the finals for the third time -- using 10 host cities in the process .			2

2020 @entity1 to be played across continent
the move is *designed* to be a one - off event to *coincide* with tournament 's 60th anniversary
@entity5 stresses that financial strains for a single host nation underpin the decision
cities will start bidding in 2013 , with a decision expected in 2014
