-- @entity2 manager @entity1 signaled his intention to stay at the @entity5 champions for at least three more years but struggling @entity6 wrecked his 70th birthday celebrations with a stunning 3 - 2 win at @entity9 saturday			1
@entity1 marked 25 years in charge of the @entity5 champions earlier this year , but his ambition clearly still burns bright			1
" i think i 've got three years at the club , " @entity1 told the official club website			1
" as long as my health stays up , and as long as i 'm still enjoying it and still getting the satisfaction of the team doing its best , " he added			2
@entity1 's top moments in 25 years in charge the legendary @entity20 has set his sights on further success in the @entity23 after their shock exit at the group stages this season and to add to the club 's tally of 19 @entity30 championships			1
" we have to continue the dominance of winning leagues and , without question , winning a @entity23 is important at this club			2
we should have been in at least another three finals			0
but you ca n't be greedy , i suppose , and having won two in my time is an achievement			0
" they were special , it was terrific to win them			0
i think i 'd be very keen to do that ( again )			0
" @entity6 , in the relegation zone of the @entity5 and with manager @entity46 under continued pressure , scored probably the most unlikely win of the season after the @entity2 faithful had paid homage to their manager before the start			1
blog : out with the old and in with the new in 2012 with @entity1 resting @entity58 and other first team regulars , their @entity56 neighbors led 1 - 0 at half time through an @entity62 penalty			1
it was awarded after @entity64 pulled down @entity65 and put away with some aplomb			0
@entity62 rifled home a super second , his 12th of the season just after the break , holding off @entity71 and @entity72 before putting his side 2 - 0 ahead			2
almost immediately , @entity64 atoned for his earlier mistake by pulling one back and when the @entity76 equalized with his sixth goal in three games , @entity2 looked set to claim victory			2
but @entity46 's men were resolute throughout and in the 80th minute grabbed the winner			0
it came after @entity2 goalkeeper @entity83 flapped at a @entity85 corner and @entity86 was on hand to head home			2
the result lifted @entity6 off the bottom , while @entity2 stayed level on points with neighbors @entity93 , who play sunday against @entity96			1
@entity1 did not temper his reaction to the disappointing defeat which prevented his side leading the @entity5 at the end of the year			1
" it is a disaster , " he told @entity100			0
" i never expected it			0
we lost two terrible goals and you ca n't do that			0
