the other week , we covered the difference between searching and stalking online			2
we dusted off our hands , satisfied with our ample labors , and just as we were about to sink into the deep cave of hibernation / suspended animation that we enter between columns , we received the following inquiry : " this has been a hard thing to admit myself , but i have a problem : i am a total and complete @entity12 stalker			1
i 'll spend hours just surfing the @entity14 , searching for details about old high school acquaintances , co-workers and potential dates			1
give me a first name and an identifying detail , and i 'll give you a whole freaking dossier			2
my friends make fun of me mercilessly , teasingly ( i hope ) calling me a creeper , and i 've seen some sitcoms and movies lately that seem to indicate that @entity12 stalking kills the mystery or whatever , but i 'm just fascinated by people -- and the fact that our lives have become so public			1
( also , sometimes stalking comes in handy -- a wedding ring can come off , you know )			2
my question is : am i really a creeper ? " - @entity40 ( ? ) in @entity41 well , @entity40 ( ? ) , assuming -- as we did in the last column with @entity44 in @entity45 -- that you are not , in fact , out of your mind , allow us to parse this out for you by way of the following examples			2
is it creepy to @entity12 stalk ... work contacts you 've just been hired ! ( finally , someone appreciates your amazing fortune cookie - writing skills			1
) you 've just shaken hands with your new cubiclemate and you 're settling into your computer chair when you 're hit with the uncontrollable urge to enter her name into @entity12 and hit " search			1
" are you a creeper ? nope			2
in the wild , wild west of fortune - cookie writing ( and all other professions ) , it 's advantageous to know as much as you can about the people you 're working with			1
does your colleague have a website ? does it have information about her past gigs ? does it include some hobby that you , too , enjoy ( she does @entity81 fan art , too ? ! ) ? well , then , feel free to cast around			2
no one is going to be creeped out that you looked at a repository of information that they themselves put online -- just do it at home ( how will you feel if she walks by to invite you to lunch and sees you 're six pages into her blog ? ) , and bring it up tactfully : " hey ! i saw your website			2
what was it like working with @entity97 ? he 's a legend ! " on the other hand , " i saw all those pics on @entity100 where you 're dressed as @entity101 , passed out on a couch			1
i love ' @entity104 , ' too ! " probably wo n't go over too well			1
as the cookie would say , " a wise man knows when to keep his mouth shut			0
" your date you 're chilling at your local tiki - themed watering hole when a tall drink of grenadine saunters up to you			0
" my name is @entity114 , " he says with a wink			0
" and i would love to take you out for a steak and my namesake sometime			0
" coyly , you extract the plastic monkey from your @entity118 and reply ( after a lengthy chug of this , your fourth sugary , plastic - animal - laden cocktail ) , " sure thing			0
whisk me away , whiskey boy ! " the next morning , after copious glasses of water and capsules of headache medicine , you get a text confirming the date you agreed to in your sugared - up state			0
through blurry eyes , you open up the web browser on your mobile phone and start entering @entity114 's liquory last name			1
are you a creeper ? well , this is where things get dicey			0
it 's totally fine to do an initial @entity12 on someone you just met ( especially somewhere like a bar or online ) simply to make sure that s / he is , in fact , who they say they are			1
but once you 've confirmed that @entity114 was n't lying about being a deep sea pearl diver / living in @entity151 / his nonmarital status , you can click on out of that search box			1
any more digging and you 're entering into @entity154 -- and , as you worried in your question , " killing the mystery			1
" @entity114 is in a band / writes epic poetry / had a @entity159 when he was 13 ? great			0
let him play you a song / e-mail you his poetry / reveal to you his childhood obsession with @entity164 of his own accord			0
if he sucks at his hobbies ( or had an unhealthy fascination with the destroyer of bloodsuckers ) , at least give him a chance to charm you before you can write him off without his knowledge			0
yourself a recent study by the @entity174 shows that 57 % of adults have plunked their own names into search engines			1
let 's get that number up , shall we ? look , googling yourself is n't vain -- it 's smart			1
a story : back in 2009 , @entity184 put out a doll named @entity186 -- a young @entity188 girl from @entity190 's @entity189			2
at the time , one of these humble columnists was working at a @entity188 culture magazine called @entity194 , and decided to blog about the doll			0
a quick search for " @entity186 " unearthed an @entity196 wanted poster for @entity198 , an allegedly armed fugitive			1
the @entity196 was thrilled with the turn of events : " any publicity that gets the word out that our @entity186 is wanted on various charges is certainly beneficial , " @entity199 , a spokeswoman for the @entity196 , told the @entity206 , but the doll now carries the name of a wanted criminal			0
a simple @entity12 search by an @entity184 employee could have waylaid that issue			1
so what exactly are we babbling about ? nowadays , when anyone can and will search for you online -- you 're not the only one , @entity40 ( ? ) -- your @entity12 results are your calling card			1
therefore , you should be aware of what comes up when someone enters your name into that magnifying glass - flanked box			0
you should even set up a @entity222 for your name			0
that way , the minute an article about a head - collecting serial killer who shares your name hits the @entity14 , you 'll know why that guy you met at that bar never called you			0
( if the above situation does happen to befall you , we suggest buying the domain associated with your name and setting up a website -- complete with clear photos of yourself -- that explicates your profession and hobbies			0
unless you are , in fact , a serial killer			0
then the @entity196 will take care of that for you			0

it 's advantageous to know as much as you can about your co-workers
do a quick search on any potential dates , but do n't spoil the mystery
@entity12 yourself early and often to prevent an identity crisis
