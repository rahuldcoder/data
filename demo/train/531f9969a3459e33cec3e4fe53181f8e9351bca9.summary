three weeks after @entity0 370 set off from @entity1 , search aircraft set off saturday from @entity3 -- hoping to , finally , find the @entity4 in the southern @entity5 where experts now believe it ended up			1
the area that search teams -- including a @entity10 @entity9 and an @entity3 p - 3 orion that set off saturday morning from @entity12 -- are now focusing on is 1,100 kilometers ( 680 miles ) to the northeast from where they 'd been concentrating for more than a week , and it 's closer to the @entity3 coast			1
this change is thanks to a new analysis of satellite data that @entity3 authorities say show the commercial airliner could not have flown as far south as once thought			1
saturday 's renewed search comes days after @entity26 and @entity27 both said they 'd sent new satellite images to @entity29 showing separate debris fields that could be related to the plane , which vanished with 239 people aboard			1
air vice-marshal @entity33 , commander of @entity34 , told @entity36 's @entity35 five of the dispatched aircraft " located debris in their search area " on friday			1
some of the spottings were " hundreds of miles away " from each other , although @entity33 said this vast expanse is " not unusual " given the ocean conditions and the time passed since the airplane 's purported crash			0
that includes 11 small objects spotted by one of his military 's p - 3 planes			2
@entity36 's @entity53 , who went out on a @entity55 p - 8 search plane friday , said the crew of that plane spotted white objects , orange rope and a blue bag			1
" at one point , sure , everybody on board got a little excited , but it 's impossible to tell from that distance what anything is , " she said			0
aircraft setting off saturday will try to relocate those objects , take photos of them for analysis , and direct four ships in the area " to their exact location , " according to @entity33			1
but again , the world must wait -- there 's no confirmation that anything spotted from the air so far has anything to do with the missing airliner , which authorities have been hunting since early march			1
" we should not underestimate the difficulty of this work ( in ) an extraordinarily remote location , " @entity3 prime minister @entity82 said saturday			1
" ... while we are throwing everything that we have at it , the task goes			0
" the @entity91 stressed what 's been detected so far " can not be verified or discounted as being from @entity93 until they are relocated and recovered by ships , " six of which are to arrive saturday in the new search area			1
they could be flotsam , like one distinctive piece of fishing gear spotted in the revised zone			2
this was not the first time it turned out suspected debris ended up being unrelated to the mystery plane : a @entity10 aircraft reported spotting possible aircraft debris early in the search , but that sighting turned out to be nothing			1
still , @entity33 said , " finding debris ... gives a lot more hope			2
" @entity29 plane saga : your questions answered better conditions the new search zone remains vast -- roughly 123,000 square miles ( 319,000 square kilometers )			1
it is still also remote -- 1,150 miles ( 1,850 kilometers ) west of @entity12			2
but @entity121 of the @entity91 said conditions there are " likely to be better more often " than they were in the old search area , where poor weather grounded flights two days this week			1
planes will be able to spend more time in the air because the new search zone is closer to land , @entity121 said			2
@entity132 flight crews involved in the search are n't frustrated or disillusioned by the sudden change in the search , @entity136			2
@entity137 of the @entity55 's @entity138 said			0
" for the pilots and the air crews , this is what they train for , " he said			0
" @entity137 told @entity36 's @entity145 on friday night that finding the debris is just part of the goal			2
oceanographers could then analyze data about current , winds and more , then , to chart where they believe the bulk of the plane lies deep underwater " finding the debris in of itself is ok			2
but it 's working backwards to that starting point , " @entity137 said aboard the @entity159			0
" and this area will be , hopefully , much better ( than the previous search area ) for that			1
" if and when the body of the 777 is found , the question still remains : why did it go down ? that may not be answered until investigators undertake the arduous process of retrieving the aircraft and trying to , literally , piece together what happened to it			2
wasted time ? some analysts have raised their eyebrows at the sudden search area shift			1
" really ? that much debris and we 're not going to have a look at it to see what that stuff might be ? " said @entity177 of the @entity178 , who helped lead the search for the flight recorders from @entity181 , which crashed into the @entity182 in 2009			1
others lamented the amount of time , money and resources that were spent in the old search area			1
" this is time that has been wasted , there 's no question , " said @entity36 aviation analyst @entity195			0
@entity29 transport minister @entity200 disputed that suggestion			0
" i do n't think we would 've done anything different from what we have done , " he said			0
@entity36 safety analyst @entity205 said it was " a good sign " that experts had adjusted their assumptions			0
" assumptions are the key to all of this , " he said			0
" if you assume something and you end up with a final conclusion , you have to constantly review that			0
" vast , evolving search the shifting hunt for flight 370 has spanned oceans and continents			0
it started in the @entity222 between @entity29 and @entity223 , where the plane went out of contact with air traffic controllers			0
when authorities learned of radar data suggesting the plane had turned west across the @entity231 after losing contact , they expanded the search into the @entity233			1
when those efforts proved fruitless , the search spread north into the @entity236 and northern @entity5			0
it then ballooned dramatically after @entity29 announced march 15 that satellite data showed the plane could have flown along two huge arcs , one stretching northwest into the @entity242 landmass , the other southwest into the @entity5			0
the search area at that point reached nearly 3 million square miles			1
on monday , @entity29 prime minister @entity246 said that further analysis of the data had led authorities to conclude the plane went down in the southern @entity5 , far from land			0
@entity29 officials told the families of those on board that nobody would have survived			0
but many relatives have said that only the discovery of wreckage from the plane will convince them of the fate of their loved ones			0
' unspeakable challenge ' for families mystery surfaces pain of 1977 tragedy questions linger did flammable cargo doom flight ? how they 're searching for debris			0

@entity3 leader : " we should not underestimate the difficulty " of the search
the search for the missing @entity279 airliner has gone on for three full weeks
authorities recently shifted the focus of the search area some 1,100 kilometers
5 aircraft spotted debris in the new area , but none is confirmed to be from @entity93
