when emperor @entity1 , the first emperor of @entity2 , anticipated his death more than 2,000 years ago , he wanted an army of warriors to guard his mausoleum forever and protect him in the afterlife			1
so he ordered the creation of some 8,000 terra - cotta soldiers , along with hundreds of terra - cotta horses and chariots , to be buried with him in his tomb			1
historians speculate the soldiers were modeled after eight individuals			0
when the statues were discovered by workers digging a well in @entity21 , @entity22 , in 1974 , the world was stunned by the spectacular funerary art and the legacy of the powerful emperor			0
since then , it 's become a major tourist attraction and a @entity28			0
now , these soldiers have a counterpart : female terra - cotta warriors			1
@entity32 , a @entity33 - born artist based in @entity34 , has created a small army of them			1
in " @entity37 , " 116 are featured in an exhibition at the @entity39 from september 10 through october 4			0
the show 's @entity41 premiere is presented by the @entity43 and @entity39 as part of @entity43 's @entity45			0
the difference is these female terra - cotta warriors are not out to protect any emperor , but were created to bring attention to the plight of girls in @entity2			1
" in @entity2 , there is a huge imbalance between boys and girls			2
i wanted to highlight the issue of gender preference , " said @entity32			1
" i needed a strong cultural symbol to base this project on , and a universal one that would speak both to @entity2 villagers in the countryside and to citizens abroad			2
" and , in a striking parallel to the terra - cotta soldiers , the terra - cotta girls will also become an archaeological project			1
after the exhibition , they will be buried in @entity2 until 2030 , the year that , according to @entity2 sociologists , men will have the hardest time finding a wife because of the skewed gender ratio			2
the imbalance of the sexes is a serious problem for the @entity2			2
a 2010 census indicates there are at least 34 million more men than women			0
due to the one - child policy and traditional preference for boys , as well as sex - selective technologies , @entity2 will have a huge surplus of men , which presents daunting demographic challenges for the world 's most populous country			1
perhaps for those reasons , @entity32 did n't encounter difficulties with the @entity2 government in pursuing this project in @entity2			2
she started working on the terra - cotta statues two years ago after finishing an installation in @entity94 that also explored gender bias			1
in deciding on the size of the female army , @entity32 chose the number eight because of its auspiciousness in @entity2 culture			1
she created the first eight statues modeled after eight girls whom she met through an orphan charity in @entity2			0
then , working with local craftsmen in @entity21 , 108 permutations of statues were made based @entity32 's original eight statues by combining the different heads , torsos and legs			1
" for @entity112 , the main craftsman i worked with in @entity2 , my project seemed at first impossible since women ' ca n't be soldiers			2
' but after we began the project , he changed his view and even turned one of the 108 combinations into a portrait of his own daughter , " said @entity32			0
the local craftsmen of @entity21 are used to making copies of the terra - cotta warriors which are sold primarily to tourists			1
when @entity32 asked them to give their artistic interpretation in sculpting the female statues , they were initially tentative			0
over time , they lost their hesitancy and gave each statue unique faces			2
no two statues have the same features			0
each terra - cotta warrior girl stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs about 260 pounds			1
their hairstyles are contemporary , as are their uniform , which is modeled after the orphan girls ' school attire			0
unlike the male warriors , they look approachable , friendly and even charming			0
" it was a very enriching collaboration , based on exchange and mutual respect , " said @entity32			0
her favorite moment was when the eight girls saw the terra - cotta statues of themselves and were delighted			1
part of the proceeds from the sale of the eight original statues will pay for the cost of the eight girls ' education for three years			0
" @entity37 " is impressive in its artistic craftsmanship and social statement			0
it 's a refreshing reinterpretation of one of @entity2 's national symbols			0
with these modern female warriors , @entity162 raises the pressing issue of gender discrimination without pointing fingers at anyone or anything			2
one looks at these amazing terra - cotta statues and feel compelled to ask -- why are n't there more of them ? and why are n't there more girls in @entity2 ?			1

@entity176 's show , " @entity37 , " opens in @entity34 on *wednesday*
creating female terra - cotta warriors is a way to address the issue of gender imbalance
due to cultural preference for boys , @entity2 will have a *big* surplus of men , which is a problem
@entity32 worked with local craftsmen in @entity2 to make each female terra - cotta statue unique
