-- it was not a blanket of snow that fell on the @entity4 this past weekend			1
it was more like a futon of snow			2
and not the light foam futons , but old - fashioned futons stuffed with horsehair or maybe potting soil			2
@entity15 futons stacked 3 feet high with no place to shovel them			0
i 'm old and i just got in from shoveling the part of our driveway that the next civic - minded city plow is going to refill			2
in truth , @entity24 handled this snow emergency like a champ -- so much better than the @entity28 of ' 78 in which people died stuck in their cars on the highway			1
but before we break out the cocoa and self - congratulations , we might want to listen to @entity35 , a @entity36 in @entity37 who lived in @entity39 for nine years			1
i blogged on saturday about how well - prepared the @entity4 was , and @entity35 jumped in with a " yeah , but ... " comment			2
" i just ca n't get used to the @entity24 oh - my - @entity42 - here - it - comes - again - flip - to - channel - 5 attitude , " he wrote			1
he explained : " the fact that @entity24 panics every time there is a flurry is due to lack of preparedness at the infrastructure level			1
in most of @entity36 , power and telephone lines are underground , it is illegal not to have snow tires on your car after december 1st or thereabouts ( if you go in the ditch , you are fined ) and during my own and my children 's school days we have never had a snow day or any other interruption due to the weather ( and we have plenty of weather )			1
i have never been to the store to stock up on batteries and water			0
... our airport does not close down for snow , though there can be delays			0
" my pride makes me want to push back on the idea that we @entity24 " panic " in the face of blizzards , not to mention that referring to this past weekend 's unpleasantness as " a flurry " goes beyond @entity79 stoicism			1
on the other hand , i remember being amused as a grad student watching the recent immigrants from sunny @entity88 climes spinning their tires in a modest @entity91 snowfall			0
what goes around comes around , and those @entity88 tires were going around at an unmoving 60 mph			0
but @entity35 raises a valid question : " why does n't @entity24 harden the grid and communications systems , put winter tires on school buses , mandate winter tires in snowy conditions and just get rid of this stupid idea of snow days ? it is winter ; it happens almost every year			1
" i 'd suggest there are two reasons we do n't			0
we 'd all like to see the poles and wires that blight our landscape come down			0
not only would this reduce power outages due to downed trees , it might also give us an opportunity to pull some optical fiber into our homes and businesses so that the @entity117 could stop falling behind the developed world in high - speed internet access			2
so let 's do it			0
except , it 's expensive			0
all those trenches to dig. all those rights of way to clear			0
all those transformers to move indoors			0
the bullet to bite is so large that we 're more willing to dribble out the price of sending out repair crews , and to put up with the far more substantial costs borne by individuals and businesses that go without power for hours , days and sometimes weeks			2
the aggregated cost of being without electricity for the 655,000 people plunged into the cold and dark by the so - called @entity140 storm , are distributed among the sufferers , and thus that cost is invisible , as is everything if one closes one 's eyes hard enough			1
besides , @entity147 gov. @entity146 estimated that it would cost $ 1 trillion to bury all the power lines throughout the commonwealth			1
various experts i consulted ( via the advanced knowledge network known as mailing lists ) supplied counter guesstimates of $ 45 billion to $ 200 billion , but with caveats about everything from the frequency of buried rocks to the increased difficulty of fixing broken underground cables			0
still , that 's between three and 70 @entity163 , to use our local unit of currency			0
not chump change , no matter how you measure it			0
which brings us to the second reason we do n't bite the bullet and snow - proof our infrastructure : we think of snowstorms as emergencies that inevitably bring with them power outages and snow days , so we do n't demand a snow - proof infrastructure			1
yes , this is circular reasoning			0
we do n't demand a fix because we do n't see the system as broken			0
it takes a @entity36 to have us wonder why we 're shutting down our cities as if it were the most natural thing in the world			2
even if we overcame both reasons and buried our power and communication lines , i doubt that we would escape all snow - caused work stoppages			1
maybe i 'm just being a panicky @entity24 , but when 2 to 3 feet of snow drops on your city so fast that you can practically hear the thump , i ca n't imagine how we 'd get our streets and trolley tracks cleaned fast enough to avoid a day when it 's better if everyone just stays at home , does some shoveling and watches " @entity205 " seasons 1 - 4			1
for , as @entity35 points out , if we did n't treat snow as an emergency , we would n't get our snow days			1
and we love our snow days			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

@entity211 : blizzard not the worst , but why is n't @entity24 better prepared ?
he says an @entity37 commenter to his blog notes @entity36 is more sensible about snow
like @entity36 , @entity24 could bury power lines , snow - proof infrastructure , he says
*writer* : it 's too costly , and in the end , people do n't see storms as *disasters* -- just as snow days
