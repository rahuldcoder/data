the ancient world was full of strange animals that have gone extinct , such as a group of marine species with claw - like structures emerging from their heads			0
a new study suggests that these creatures were related to spiders and scorpions			2
researchers discovered the fossilized remains of a species in southwest @entity14 that provides new insights into the evolution of animals in the modern era , scientists said			1
they report their findings in the journal @entity21			0
scientists believe that the creature -- 1 inch long , and with two pairs of eyes -- lived 520 million years ago and that it crawled or swam in the ocean			1
they were able to reconstruct the creature 's nervous system to gain insights about its evolutionary relationships to animals familiar to us			1
" for the first time , we are able to use fossilised neural anatomy to sort out how fossil animals are related to animals today , " study co-author @entity33 of the @entity34 at the @entity35 in @entity36 wrote in an e-mail			2
this creature belongs to the @entity45 genus , and its place in the animal kingdom lies in " a group of weird extinct animals " called the " megacheiran " or " great appendage " arthropods , @entity33 said			2
the species of the @entity48 had elongated , segmented bodies with about 12 pairs of appendages they used for swimming or crawling			0
they also had a pair of long , scissor - like head claws , most likely for grabbing or sensing			0
scientists say the reconstruction of the new creature 's nervous system is the most complete for an arthropod living at that time , in the @entity67 geological period			1
@entity68 makes a splash : the rarest whale the brain and central nervous system of the creature are organized in a way that is similar to those of the chelicerata , the group that includes horseshoe crabs and scorpions			1
this suggests a close evolutionary relationship between the ancient @entity45 and the living chelicerata			0
a distinct group of arthropods called the mandibulates includes lobsters , insects , centipedes and millipedes			0
last year at the same site in @entity14 -- called the @entity92 formation near @entity93 -- @entity33 and colleagues discovered a 520 million - year - old crustacean - type nervous system in an animal called @entity97			1
taken together , these discoveries suggest that by 520 million years ago , the two major groups of arthropods had diverged			1
their common ancestor must have been older , researchers said			0
" this means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans , " co-author @entity111 , neuroscience professor at the @entity112 , said in a statement			0
@entity111 's team used sophisticated imaging techniques to look at the inch - long @entity45 fossil			2
one kind of scan revealed that iron had built up in the nervous system as the creature fossilized			1
they also used a technique called computed tomography that reconstructs 3 - d features			0
by combining these images and discarding any data that were n't in both , they were able to create a sort of negative x-ray photograph , " and out popped this beautiful nervous system in startling detail , " @entity111 said			1
it confirmed what scientists had believed from the creature 's outward appearance : the extinct genus @entity45 was related to chelicerates ( spiders , scorpions and others )			2
they also saw that the brain in the fossil was like the brains found in modern scorpions and spiders			1
if researchers find a fossil with features shared by this creature and the crustacean - like fossil @entity33 and colleagues found last year , that could be a common ancestor of both			2
there 's plenty more weirdness from ancient history to uncover			0
18 - foot oarfish discovered			0

the fossil is 520 million years old and was found in @entity14
using *multiple* images of the animal , the researchers discovered the nervous system
they also saw the brain was like those of today 's spiders , scorpions
the work shows the early evolutionary *differences* , researcher says
