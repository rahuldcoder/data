-- @entity1 dreamed of living a seafaring life like the historic @entity4 naval officer who shared her name centuries ago			1
she 'd secured a spot as a crew member on a replica of the @entity4 and had announced it proudly on her @entity10 page			1
but less than six months after joining the ship , her dream was cut short			2
as @entity13 approached the @entity14 , its powerful winds swirled up waves that crippled the three - masted , 180 - foot @entity4 off @entity18 's coast , forcing the 16 - member crew to abandon ship			1

" she boasted about the bounty and her new assignment to her friends and family , describing the ship as a " sailing museum " on her @entity10 page			0
on @entity61 , @entity25 announced " i am in love with my ship ... @entity4 " seeing it as an opportunity to share " our ship and our history , " she posted , " i 'm sure my ancestor would be proud ... " the ship , she hoped , would begin more efforts toward educating schoolchildren , she told reporters			1

" other than his wife , he acts like it 's his first love , " said @entity168 , who works at @entity169 in @entity110 , where the @entity4 is often docked			2
