-- a @entity2 judge granted a defense request monday to transfer @entity5 @entity4 to a jail closer to his lawyers in @entity8 as he awaits trial on murder charges			1
judge @entity11 approved the move after @entity4 's lawyers asked to make the commute shorter between their law offices in @entity8 and the jail in @entity17 where @entity4 has been held for more than a year			1
@entity4 's lawyers have said the trip , about 60 miles , can take up to two hours in traffic			1
since his arrest in june 2013 , @entity4 has been held at the @entity21 in a 10 - feet - by - 7 - feet cell			0
inside the case against @entity4 @entity17 sheriff @entity24 told @entity0 that @entity4 likely will be transferred to another jail on tuesday			1
watching the proceedings monday were @entity4 's mother and older brother , @entity28 , who is an assistant coach at the @entity29			1
both have remained silent on the charges			0
also in attendance was @entity33 , mother of murder victim @entity34			0
@entity4 is charged with " orchestrating the execution " of @entity34 on june 17 , 2013			2
in a separate case , the former tight end also is charged in the drive - by shootings of @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity8 in 2012			0
that trial is set for may 2015			0
he has pleaded not guilty to all three murder charges			0
judge @entity11 did not finalize a trial date in the @entity34 case , unsure whether the defense could be ready by october as she had suggested			2
on monday , defense lawyers suggested they might file a change of venue motion , which could delay the trial			2
the judge also did not rule on previous defense motions to dismiss a first - degree murder charge or throw out a june 18 , 2013 search warrant of @entity4 's home in relation to the @entity34 case			1
@entity4 's lawyers have argued the state has failed to meet minimum probable - cause standards to make that first - degree murder charge stick			1
in a june hearing , defense lawyer @entity61 told a judge all he 's heard is " a lot of smoke " but few specifics			2
" who killed mr. @entity34 ? why ? whether it was part of a plan and if so , whose plan ? what happened to the car , and what happened at the scene ? " @entity61 argued in that hearing			0
the search warrant in question turned up evidence including surveillance video from interior cameras as well as cellphones , an @entity83 and other items			0
the images include a still allegedly taken shortly after @entity34 's slaying that shows @entity4 holding what prosecutors believe is the murder weapon , according to a law enforcement source			1
a .45 - caliber gun allegedly used to fire eight shots has never been found			0
the case against @entity4 : where 's the weapon ? defense attorneys argue investigators did not have the legally required search warrant paperwork with them			1
in a motion , @entity4 ' lawyers state a @entity2 state trooper entering the house " clearly has no file folder in his hand , " with documents			2
if the defense successfully quashes the search warrant , the pictures from that search could become inadmissible			0
prosecutors maintain the search was carried out by the book			0
on wednesday , in a second court appearance this week , @entity4 's defense team hopes to get a court - approved subpoena to demand the @entity118 turn over all medical records and psychological tests involving their former star tight end			1
so far , @entity4 ' lawyers said there has been " no agreement " with the team over their request for documents			2
a motion calls the records potential evidence that may bear upon @entity4 's state of mind and " physical and mental state " prior to @entity34 's murder			1
the move indicates his attorneys might be considering a diminished capacity defense -- being less capable of knowing right from wrong -- legal experts said , if there is credible evidence			0
" my instinct is they try to argue he was n't mentally capable of planning or intending any murder , and thus , first degree murder should be off the table , " @entity141 law professor @entity140 told @entity0			0
the rise and fall of @entity4 source : @entity4 's anger over two trivial incidents linked to killing @entity0 's @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report .			1
