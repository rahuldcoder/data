@entity0 -- @entity2 came to @entity3 with his family as a six - year - old , fleeing the civil war in @entity7			1
he grew up in @entity0			0
but his family says that when he turned 16 , @entity3 's @entity10 secret service asked @entity2 to become a spy -- willingly or not			1
" they always used to tell him , ' you either work for us or you are guilty of being a terrorist , ' " his father , @entity12 , told @entity1			0
@entity2 filed an official complaint and his local lawmaker met with @entity10 representatives			1
but , his family says , the pressure persisted			2
his father , returning from a pilgrimage to the @entity25 , was stopped at the airport by two people he claims identified themselves as working for @entity10			1
" i told them , listen , i 'm on your side			0
as a father , i do n't want my son to be in danger			0
and i do n't want him to harm anyone			0
put on the table what kind of proof you have against my son			0
let 's cooperate and work together as a parent , " he said			2
" but they never had anything -- which is what makes me believe that they had another agenda			0
which is the one he always mentioned			0
that they want him to be an informant and work for them			0
" this pressure was the reason for his son 's return to @entity7 , @entity12 said			1
" he never had peace here			0
he was being harassed all the time			0
" @entity2 traveled to @entity57 and @entity58 as a teenager			1
then , in 2010 , his family says , @entity2 returned to @entity61			1
he got married , had a child and then , in december 2011 , he disappeared			2
stripped of citizenship in july last year , his family received a letter from @entity3 's @entity65 stating that @entity2 had been stripped of his citizenship for the " public good			1
" " the reason for this decision is that the @entity10 assess that you have been involved in @entity72 extremism and present a risk to the national security of the @entity3 due to your extremist activities , " the letter says			1
then , on december 21 , 2012 -- almost a year after he disappeared -- @entity2 turned up in a @entity77 criminal court in @entity78 , @entity79 , charged with " material support " of a terror organization , @entity81 , and allegedly training to be a suicide bomber			1
two other men were charged with him			2
" as alleged , these defendants are not aspiring terrorists , they are terrorists			0
they did more than receive terrorist training : they put that training to practice in terrorist operations with @entity81			0
their capture and prosecution are important steps in the continuing campaign against terrorism , " said @entity90 , the assistant director in charge of the @entity93 's field office in @entity79 , in a statement announcing the charges in december			2
@entity2 denies all the charges , according to his @entity77 lawyer , @entity103			1
a statement from the @entity93 says @entity2 was arrested in " @entity105 " by local police in august last year and then handed to the @entity93			1
according to his lawyers , @entity2 says he was detained in @entity108 in june			1
he saw cellmates beaten and tortured with electric shocks there , @entity2 says			1
he claims he was given a choice in @entity108 : sign a confession or be tortured			2
eventually he was turned over to @entity77 authorities , who flew him to the @entity77 , @entity103 said			1
the lawyer cites the @entity93 as saying he arrived in late november			0
@entity2 's @entity3 citizenship was stripped from him just a short time before he was put on a plane to the @entity77 , @entity103 said			1
that move is being challenged before a special board of immigration appeal , he said			0
" but as of now , the @entity3 government has offered no assistance to this matter whatsoever			2
" ' new and improved rendition ' @entity2 's father does n't understand how his son has ended up in a @entity78 criminal court			1
" he has never been to the @entity77 even for a holiday			2
he has never threatened the @entity77			2
we do n't know why he was taken all the way there , " he said			0
from his parents ' point of view , he was kidnapped and taken to the @entity77			2
@entity103 said @entity2 's case is an example of a disturbing new trend he has heard called " new and improved rendition			1
" " i mean that the agonies that were inflicted in earlier renditions , the government has reacted to that , but they still take people from foreign countries , bring them into the @entity77 , and they 're going to try him here , " the attorney said			2
" in my mind , that has long - term ramifications that , if carried out to their logical end , would mean the 20,000 people in @entity7 are now eligible to be brought to the @entity77 and tried in a @entity77 court			1
that 's a little bit disturbing , and that 's an understatement			2
" because he is no longer considered a @entity3 citizen , @entity2 has received no help from the @entity3 government			1
his mother told @entity1 it has changed the way she thinks of her adopted homeland			0
" when we came this country , it was ( as ) you know , asylum seeker , " she said			0
" they said you are welcome			0
and now ( they say ) you are welcome to be hunted			0
for our kids , our brothers and sisters			0
the whole community , not only my son			0
" @entity2 is now fighting to regain his @entity3 citizenship while in a @entity79 detention center			1
but exactly how he disappeared off the streets of @entity61 and reappeared in a @entity78 courtroom remains a mystery			1
@entity1 's @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report .			0
