the @entity2 @entity1 will vote thursday on holding attorney general @entity3 in contempt of @entity5 for withholding documents involving the failed @entity8 weapons crackdown , speaker @entity0 said wednesday			1
" we 're going to proceed , " @entity0 , @entity9 , told reporters			1
" we 've given them ample opportunity to reply			0
" late wednesday , the @entity13 approved the procedure for thursday 's debate and vote , which could bring the unprecedented contempt citation of a sitting attorney general			1
the move came the day after @entity20 rejected the latest offer by the @entity1 and @entity22 to turn over some of the documents sought by congressional investigators			1
administration and justice officials met tuesday with senior aides to @entity0 and @entity29 chairman @entity28 , @entity30 , to try to head off the @entity1 vote			1
however , a senior @entity1 @entity33 aide said an offer to let congressional investigators see some of the requested documents in return for dropping the contempt measure was insufficient			1
a group of @entity40 , led by the @entity41 , said it was planning to walk out of the @entity1 chamber on thursday and boycott the vote			1
in a letter to @entity1 members that was still being circulated late wednesday for signatures , the @entity40 opposed to voting on the @entity33 - sponsored resolutions said , " contempt power should be used sparingly , carefully and only in the most egregious situations			1
the @entity33 leadership has articulated no legislative purpose for pursuing this course of action			0
for these reasons we can not and will not participate in a vote to hold the attorney general in contempt			1
" the letter went on to say the signers would refuse to participate in any vote that " would tarnish the image of @entity5 or of an attorney general who has done nothing but work tirelessly to protect the rights of the @entity2 people			1
we must reflect upon why we are elected to this body and choose now to stand up for justice			0
" a senior @entity70 aide told @entity71 that , in addition to the @entity41 , which includes more than 40 members , the @entity74 , the @entity75 , and the @entity76 may also participate			0
it was unclear whether any @entity70 leaders would join the boycott			0
the move would mirror a similar walkout by @entity20 in 2008 , when @entity40 , who then controlled the @entity1 , voted to hold two top @entity84 officials in contempt of @entity5			1
the ranking @entity86 on the oversight committee called wednesday for @entity0 to try to work out a solution with @entity3 instead of holding a vote on thursday			1
" why are we steamrolling ahead on a matter of such gravity ? " asked rep. @entity90 , @entity91			0
" in my opinion the answer is plain and simple : politics			0
" there was no word wednesday whether @entity90 would participate in the planned boycott			0
in a letter to @entity0 , rep. @entity102 , @entity103 , asked him to reconsider his decision to bring the contempt citation to the floor			1
" holding the nation 's top law - enforcement officer in contempt of @entity5 would be a drastic , disproportionate action on the part of this body , " she wrote			1
@entity8 investigation started with agent 's death president @entity117 has asserted executive privilege on some documents in the dispute , preventing them from being turned over on grounds they include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes			0
at tuesday 's meeting , the @entity22 also offered to conduct a briefing , give @entity5 documents related to whistle - blowers in the case and work with the committee to respond to any questions it may have had after reviewing the materials			0
" this was a good - faith effort to try to reach an accommodation while still protecting the institutional prerogatives of the executive branch , often championed by these same republicans criticizing us right now , " @entity1 spokesman @entity135 told @entity71			2
" unfortunately , republicans have opted for political theater rather than conduct legitimate congressional oversight			0
" @entity0 , however , said wednesday that a failure to cooperate by the @entity117 administration had forced @entity1 @entity33 to take up the contempt measure			1
republicans on the @entity29 last week recommended citing @entity3			2
the @entity149 launched @entity8 out of @entity150 to track weapons purchases by @entity153 drug cartels			0
it followed similar programs started in the @entity157 administration			0
however , @entity8 lost track of more than 1,000 firearms it was tracking in the operation , and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of @entity165 agent @entity8			0
@entity28 and @entity33 contend that @entity3 and the @entity22 are concealing details of how @entity8 was approved and managed			2
@entity40 argue that @entity28 and his @entity33 colleagues are using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting @entity3 and , by extension , the president in an election year			1
the showdown between @entity28 and @entity3 over the program dates back to subpoenas issued last year by the @entity176			2
at the @entity13 meeting wednesday , @entity28 conceded that investigators lack any evidence that @entity3 knew of the failed weapons - tracking tactics of @entity8			1
the contempt citation , he said , was for @entity3 's failure to comply with subpoenas seeking specific documents			1
" it 's not for what the attorney general knew about @entity8 , " @entity28 said			1
" it 's about the attorney general 's refusal to provide the documents			1
" @entity28 , @entity1 clash over @entity8 executive privilege @entity90 and other @entity40 contended that @entity28 conducted an improper investigation of @entity3 and @entity8			1
they complained the chairman refused to let witnesses proposed by @entity40 give public testimony and was demanding documents outside the scope of the subpoenas @entity3 is accused of violating			2
a video released tuesday by @entity40 on @entity28 's panel showed the chairman making past allegations of @entity1 links to @entity8 , juxtaposed with @entity28 saying sunday there was no evidence of a @entity1 cover - up			2
some gun rights advocates , including the @entity210 , maintain that the program that allowed hundreds of weapons , including assault rifles , to end up in the hands of @entity153 drug cartels was a way for the @entity117 administration to press for new gun - control laws			0
@entity28 said sunday he had e-mails showing the administration planned to point to the operation and push for a " weapons ban or greater reporting			0
" however , @entity90 pushed back at @entity28 's claim tuesday , telling reporters , " i do n't believe that , and i think it 's very unfortunate that people are coming up with these theories			0
" @entity70 leaders in the @entity1 concede that some @entity40 could join with republicans to hold @entity3 in contempt , citing pressure from the @entity210			1
" there 's been no polling of our membership on how they will respond to the @entity210 , but suffice it to say certainly that the @entity210 is a major force " in @entity241 , rep. @entity242 , @entity243 , told reporters wednesday			0
he predicted the " strong majority " of the @entity70 caucus would oppose the contempt measure			0
the committee vote last week was on strict party lines , with republicans supporting a contempt recommendation and @entity40 opposing it			2
the vote occurred before the gun lobby formally registered its support for the contempt resolution			2
rarely has any pro-gun - rights @entity86 representing a rural and @entity258 district broken with the @entity210 's position on key votes , especially in an election year			0
" the reason we support the contempt resolution is the same reason we first called for attorney general @entity3 's resignation more than a year ago : the @entity22 's obstruction of congressional oversight of a program that costs lives in support of an anti-gun agenda , " said a letter to @entity28 last week from @entity210 executive director @entity263			1
the @entity210 , which frequently weighs in on congressional races with endorsements and support of a national grassroots network , also warned of electoral consequences for anyone voting against the contempt measure			2
" this is an issue of utmost seriousness , and the @entity210 will consider this vote in our future candidate evaluations , " the organization said			2
opinion : do n't be nosy about @entity8 @entity290 @entity289 , @entity291 , said last week that @entity33 were targeting @entity3 because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in november			0
on wednesday , @entity242 chastised @entity33 for pushing ahead on the contempt vote as part of a strategy to prevent economic progress and harm @entity117 's re-election chances in november			2
" this is just all part of a continuing plan , and whether it 's suppressing the vote or suppressing the economy -- this obstructionist regime that we see that continues to block because they think they would rather see president @entity117 fail than the nation succeed , " @entity242 said			0
@entity28 's panel has been seeking documents that show why the @entity22 decided to withdraw as inaccurate the february 2011 letter			0
however , @entity3 has refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations , and asked @entity117 to assert executive privilege over such documents last week .			0
