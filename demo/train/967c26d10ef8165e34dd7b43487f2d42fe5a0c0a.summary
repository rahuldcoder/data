-- what 's in a gesture ? a gesture of support for a friend , a gesture that is " anti-system , " says @entity8 footballer @entity7 , who chose to celebrate his goal - scoring performance in an @entity12 game last weekend with a movement that has sparked controversy not just in the sporting world but also the political			1
known as the " quenelle , " it involves pointing the right arm straight down and touching that arm with the left hand			0
@entity7 explained that saturday 's celebration was nothing more than a nod to his friend , controversial @entity8 comedian @entity26 , who has popularized the gesture in @entity8			1
but others believe the gesture is a @entity31 salute in reverse , and it has been linked to rising anti-semitism in @entity8 -- a charge over which @entity26 faces an investigation by the @entity37 prosecutor 's office			1
during a performance , @entity26 said of a prominent @entity40 journalist : " me , you see , when i hear @entity42 speak , i think to myself : ' gas chambers ... too bad ( they no longer exist )			2
" whatever you think the " quenelle " is , @entity7 and @entity26 are provoking huge controversy on both sides of the @entity48			1
there have been demands that @entity54 football 's governing body severely punishes the former @entity8 international forward			2
in @entity8 , @entity26 's right to perform his controversial show has become a touchstone for " freedom of speech " advocates			1
fractured society " this gesture was just a special dedication to my comedian friend @entity26 , " @entity7 explained on his @entity63 page as accusations of @entity33 seethed around him following the match between his club @entity66 and @entity67			1
" ( the ) meaning ( of ) quenelle : anti-system			0
i do not know what the word religion has to do with this story ! " of course , i am neither racist nor anti-semitic			0
" @entity7 is not the only sports star to be embroiled in controversy as photographs emerged of other @entity8 athletes -- basketball superstar @entity77 plus footballers @entity81 and @entity83 , who like @entity7 play in @entity54 -- making the " quenelle			1
" all three have apologized for any offense caused			0
but the furore has shone a light on signs of an increasingly fractious @entity8 society			2
@entity91 , spokesman for @entity92 -- @entity92 -- which is fighting fighting racial discrimination , told @entity0 that there was a 59 % rise in anti-semitic attacks in 2012			1
according to the @entity8 @entity98 , there were 1,539 racist and anti-semitic attacks in 2012 , a rise of 22 %			1
he also explained that @entity7 's use of the " quenelle " blurred the lines between what is anti-establishmentarianism and anti-semitism			1
" it is a way of @entity7 boosting his image as a controversial person , " @entity91 said			1
" in @entity8 people are taking sides			2
are you for or against establishment ? the fact that @entity7 is doing the quenelle ... " originally it was used by @entity26 in his first shows			1
but the ' quenelle ' has been used in front of @entity125 and in front of the ( @entity40 ) school in @entity128 , " added @entity91 , referring to the @entity120 school where three children and a teacher were murdered last year			0
" if you look closer these people say they are willing to fight the system , but it 's a system they say is controlled by @entity40 people			0
" powder keg @entity135 , the @entity54 correspondent of @entity136 , said that @entity7 and @entity81 's support for anti-establishment views were very much in vogue in @entity8			1
" the idea that you are against the system invariably means that you are against anyone who disagrees with your point of view , " he told @entity0			0
" it has little to do with social or ethnic origin			0
you have young , white middle - class men and women saying the same thing			0
" when i go back to @entity8 it is like there are two parallel universes ; a government that is widely perceived as incompetent , with a social situation that is like a powder keg			2
" @entity156 is on the rise and it has become completely acceptable to be openly anti-semitic and to say that there is a global @entity160 conspiracy			2
" @entity7 also received short shrift from another @entity8 sports writer @entity162			1
" @entity7 portrays himself as an anti-establishment hero but this is an anti-establishment hero who is pictured emerging from his @entity169 at the entrance to @entity171 and has appeared in an advert in @entity8 for the hamburger restaurant chain @entity174 , " wrote @entity162 in @entity165 's @entity164 newspaper			1
@entity26 congratulated @entity7 on @entity63 for using the " quenelle " to celebrate his goal against @entity67 , which has a zero - tolerance policy on anti-semitic chants at its stadium -- prompted by racist abuse the club 's fans aimed at the supporters of @entity171 rival @entity184 in 2012			1
the 46 - year - old @entity26 , who ran in the @entity186 elections as an anti-zionist , has been fined several times in @entity8 for anti-semitic commentary			1
the @entity8 government said this month it wants to ban his live performances			2
" @entity26 uses anti-semitic discourse in his shows in the sense of fighting @entity195 , " @entity91 explained			2
" he says he has @entity40 friends			0
he is against @entity195 who he says have power			0
" he releases videos on @entity200 and gets millions of views in 24 hours			0
@entity200 is subject to @entity203 law			0
if those videos were published under @entity8 law those videos would be deleted			0
" @entity26 is very popular			0
people say it is hard to speak your mind in @entity8 because political power is too strong			0
" meanwhile @entity7 must wait to hear what the @entity212 decides to do			0
" the club fully acknowledges that @entity7 ' goal celebration has caused offense in some quarters and has asked @entity7 not to perform the gesture again			1
@entity7 immediately agreed to adhere to this request , " his employer @entity66 said on monday			0
what 's in a gesture ? @entity7 could yet find out to his cost .			2
