@entity0 -- one of the 23 @entity5 whom an @entity4 court convicted in absentia of kidnapping a terrorism suspect in 2003 has been arrested in @entity9 on an @entity4 arrest warrant , the @entity4 justice ministry 's press office said thursday			1
the ministry identified the arrested man as @entity13 , who @entity4 prosecutors said had been the @entity16 base chief in @entity17			1
in a 2009 trial , an @entity4 court convicted @entity13 and 22 others of abducting @entity21 , or @entity22 , from the streets of @entity17 in 2003			1
the trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call " extraordinary rendition			0
" they say the @entity5 has often transferred terrorism suspects to countries that practice torture			2
@entity22 , who was suspected of recruiting men to fight in @entity33 and @entity34 and was under heavy surveillance by @entity4 's intelligence agency , was transferred to @entity37 and tortured , @entity4 prosecutors said			1
@entity4 prosecutors said @entity22 was nabbed by a @entity16 team working with @entity4 officials			2
a former senior @entity16 official said @entity13 is no longer with the @entity16			1
in the 2009 trial , the @entity4 court sentenced @entity13 to eight years in prison , prosecutor @entity41 said			2
the other @entity5 were sentenced to five years			0
each of the 23 @entity5 was ordered to pay 1 million euros ( about $ 1.3 million ) to @entity22 , plus 500,000 euros to his wife			0
but at the time , it seemed unlikely that the convictions would have much effect on the @entity5 , as none appeared at the trial and the @entity4 government did not ask for their extradition			0
@entity52 has acknowledged making secret " rendition " transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do			0
