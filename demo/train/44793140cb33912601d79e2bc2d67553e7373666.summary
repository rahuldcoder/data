-- when art expert @entity2 cast a dart at a map of @entity5 , she had no idea it would spark an eight - year love affair with a country she had never seen before			1
" it landed in @entity10 , " @entity2 recalled , " it was just a playful planning method			1
" after taking aim at the world 's second - largest continent , the dart randomly struck @entity10 's @entity16 , in the east of the country bordering neighboring @entity18			1
the exercise was the beginning of @entity2 's extensive research into @entity10 's contemporary art culture and her mission to push @entity5 onto the global art scene			1

" between 2005 and 2011 i went to @entity10 three times , " she said , " visiting 45 artists in that period			1
i went to major cities like @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			0
" @entity2 -- originally from the @entity51 city of @entity52 -- is now based in @entity53 and works as a public relations director for @entity55 @entity0 's @entity56 spoke to @entity2 about her vision of @entity59 art and its place on the global stage			1
@entity0 : you 've visited 45 artists over the course of your research , what is the objective behind it ? @entity2 : contemporary art is dominated by a eurocentric attitude today and it is that attitude that decides what is relevant and what is n't			1
this prevents artists from regions of the world that are not located in @entity76 or @entity77 from getting the attention they deserve			2

@entity0 : who did you interview for the " @entity28 of @entity10 - @entity34 " project and why ? @entity100 : the project includes research and film material about many different artists like professor @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 , among others			1
these are prominent artists in @entity10			2
hopefully , a resource like this will provide art professionals , scholars and practitioners as well as art lovers from all over the world the chance to get to know the different artists and protagonists of the @entity10 contemporary art scene through the @entity124			1
@entity0 : what inspired you to pursue such a project ? @entity100 : this project was inspired by a couple of disappointing events and stories which i observed in my professional career regarding how great and talented artists from outside of @entity76 were treated by the western art establishment			2
it is very important that artists who are based and work in @entity5 determine and define for themselves the narrative about contemporary @entity59 art. read more : stunning @entity142 artwork shows conflict in a different light in my view , even highly educated intellectuals and experts ( in the @entity147 ) let themselves be influenced by prejudices and stereotypes of the continent such as images of hunger and war in @entity5			2
( they ) treat @entity59 countries with a mixture of patronizing empathy and intellectual loftiness , and definitely not on a par with themselves			0
@entity0 : why do you believe this is so ? @entity100 : too often artists from the @entity59 continent have been confronted with ignorance or condescending attitudes in the @entity147 and this is definitely some kind of intellectual conflict caused by a lack of multicultural competence and in some cases just plain arrogance			0
a simple example is the fact that art from @entity59 countries is usually shunted to the anthropological department whereas art from @entity76 and @entity77 will be dealt with in the " @entity179			0
" @entity0 : you 're from @entity51 in @entity5 and you live in @entity181 , why was @entity10 the best place for your research ? @entity100 : i have an @entity59 heritage and i specifically chose a country that i did n't know because i wanted to look at that country and its art from an objective perspective			2
i did n't want to be influenced by friends and relatives who are members of the art scene so i wanted to go somewhere where i did n't know anyone			0
read this : artists ' road trip across @entity5 @entity0 : what makes your research different from other art research and documentary projects related to @entity5 ? @entity100 : i think the project explores and reveals the contemporary art scene in @entity10 as viewed by local artists and protagonists			1
this is important because it is independent of what @entity76 or @entity209 art experts , critics and historians have to say about that scene , while also reiterating the message that @entity5 is not a country			0
there are thousands of cultures , sub-cultures and histories in @entity5 and it is about being sensitive to that			0
i think the interviews highlight the individual and not the collective			0
@entity0 : what is it about @entity5 that fascinates you ? @entity100 : i think the attitude of the people is more dramatic and expressive than we 're used to in the developed world			0
for instance , the market stalls in @entity234 , when they barter it looks like they 're fighting but that 's just how they communicate passionately			0
there 's a fear of @entity5 , a fascination fear			0
when western photographers and artists go to @entity5 , they are mesmerized by the amount of light and shadows in the sky and the atmosphere is very different			0
but at the same time , i think a colonial attitude exists still , that need to control a fear of the unknowing in @entity5			0
it 's very much a love - fear relationship and that 's what fascinates us .			2
