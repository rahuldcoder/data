-- violence in @entity2 is back in the news and so is the perennial question : is @entity2 safe ? in just the last few weeks there have been stories of 12 young people allegedly abducted in daylight from a @entity10 club ; the death by beating of @entity14 's grandson , also in the capital ; the kidnapping of a @entity18 reservist from his father 's ranch ; the freeing of 165 people , including two pregnant women , who had been held prisoner ; and the case of an @entity27 mom traveling on a bus who was arrested and jailed , accused of smuggling drugs			1
that 's all before you look at the staggering toll of the years - long war between security forces and drug cartels -- at least 60,000 people killed in drug - related violence from 2006 to 2012 , according to @entity39			1
other observers put the number even higher			1
disappearances in @entity10 linked to gang outside of war zones , more @entity44 have been killed in @entity2 in the last decade than in any other country outside the @entity44 , and the number of @entity44 deaths jumped from 35 in 2007 to 113 in 2011			1
but those numbers do not lead to any simple conclusion			2
millions of @entity44 visit @entity2 every year without incident , and the number of tourists continues to grow			1
nearly 6 million @entity44 citizens visited @entity2 in 2012 , according to data from @entity2 's tourism ministry			1
the first quarter of 2013 has seen a 5.9 % uptick in @entity44 tourists compared to a year before , the ministry reported			1
analysts and travel experts agree that security in @entity2 varies -- sometimes dramatically -- from place to place			1
it 's a contradiction -- @entity2 is both as dangerous as ever or as safe as ever , depending on one 's destination , actions and common sense			1
" i think what you see in @entity2 over the past few years is this movable target of what 's safe and what 's not safe , " said @entity70 , senior fellow for @entity72 studies at the @entity73			1
of course you can be hurt anywhere , but the risks are different for a business trip to the capital , seeking sun and sand in @entity86 or visiting family across the border			2
@entity10 caution residents of @entity10 were gripped this week by the disappearance of 12 young people from an after - hours bar in a popular entertainment district			2
the families of the missing , one only 16 years old , allege that they were kidnapped in broad daylight by an armed group			2
investigators have confirmed that the group was at the @entity101 after nightclub , but the case remains shrouded in mystery : there was no sign of an armed group or of a struggle at the scene , officials said			2
the incident grabbed attention because it was a particularly brazen crime for the nation 's massive capital			1
throughout the violence spawned by the drug war , @entity10 remained a relatively safe place , not immune , but not awash in gangland violence			1
twenty years ago , the city had a reputation as a dangerous place , but successive local administrations have made it safe for residents and visitors			2
analyst @entity70 points out that there is a large police and security camera presence to keep it that way			2
" even if there was this wave of organized crime coming in , the law enforcement capacity in @entity10 is much higher than in other parts of the country , " she said			2
@entity137 , grandson of @entity14 , died last month after suffering an apparent beating in @entity10			2
many of the details of his night out remain unknown , but he had been at a bar one block south of @entity144 , a rough but famous patch of the capital known for its mariachis			2
those who know the city say that , just like any other major metropolis , there are areas that visitors should stay away from at certain hours			0
" physical safety if you are in the main tourist areas and you are sensible is not a problem , " in @entity10 , said @entity154 , professor emeritus at @entity155 who has researched public security in @entity2			1
" bad things happen to good people , but that 's just a small fraction			0
" the @entity165 has issued no travel advisories for @entity10			0
opinion : in @entity2 , guilty till proven innocent safe at the beach the majority of the millions of @entity44 who visit @entity2 head to resort cities along its coasts			1
the most popular destinations , according to @entity2 officials , are @entity86 , @entity177 , @entity178 , and @entity179			1
and while it 's impossible to separate completely the parts of @entity2 on drug routes from where tourists go , there is a level of separation , @entity70 said			1
drug trafficking may happen in @entity86 just like anywhere else , but the tourist areas are typically safe , she said			0
3 undeniable reasons to explore @entity2 one thing the tourist destinations have in common , besides beaches , is that none is the subject of a travel advisory			1
@entity198 , owner of @entity199 in @entity200 , staunchly defends @entity2 as a safe destination			1
" i 've never felt threatened in any way , and that 's what i tell my clients , " she said			0
she blames the media for focusing on the negative and provoking fear in would - be travelers			0
that 's all that people read about , @entity209 said			0
" i 've seen more paranoia , for sure , " she said			0
" but it 'll pass			0
" once her clients vacation in @entity2 , they come back and wonder why they were scared at all in the first place , she said			1
by the numbers : @entity44 - @entity2 relations border remains an unknown two of the recent incidents that garnered headlines -- the jailing of @entity227 , accused of smuggling marijuana , and the search for missing @entity18 reservist @entity230 -- took place near the border			1
the area where @entity2 abuts the @entity44 is culturally unique and sees hundreds of billions of dollars ' worth of cross-border trade pass by on trucks			1
but the proximity to the @entity44 makes many border cities key to illegal markets as well			0
drug cartels fighting for lucrative smuggling routes engage in turf battles that can turn cities into war zones			0
@entity244 experienced this in the mid- 2000s , and later , @entity246 suffered the same			0
the number of killings in @entity246 , across the border from @entity251 , has dropped enough for the city to shed the title " @entity254			0
" ( @entity255 , in northwest @entity256 , has topped that list for the last two years			0
) brazen daylight shootings and mass killings farther south in the state of @entity261 , across from where @entity200 hits the @entity263 , are no longer in the news			2
but that does not mean all is well			0
rape case in @entity2 resort city puts violence back in the spotlight " @entity261 is under the control of criminal groups , " said @entity154 , the professor with expertise in @entity2 public security			1
the cartels may not be having daily shootouts in the streets , but the risks for those who venture to the wrong place at the wrong time persist , he said			0
@entity282 was arrested in the northwestern state of @entity284 after the bus she was riding was searched at a military checkpoint			0
soldiers claimed to have found 12 pounds of marijuana under her seat and detained her			0
a very public campaign by her family put pressure on a judge to release her , which he did after a video showed that she did not board the bus with the illicit bundles			2
buses have previously been targeted by criminal groups for extortion and kidnapping			0
in 2011 , the @entity44 @entity305 in @entity306 , across the border from @entity304 , @entity200 , issued a warning against bus travel after at least three reports by @entity44 that their buses were boarded by criminals			0
in at least one case , the male bus passengers , including one @entity44 citizen , were forcibly removed and went missing			0
in @entity261 this week , authorities freed 165 migrants apparently kidnapped and held , possibly for ransom			0
the @entity165 has issued a travel warning for visitors to " defer nonessential travel " to most areas of @entity2 's border states			1
overall , @entity155 's @entity154 said travel to @entity2 is safer today than two years ago			1
but it has a lot to do with one 's common sense and a twist on the old adage -- not so much who you know but where you go and what you do			0
" @entity44 , " @entity154 said , " have a gift for finding trouble if they 're looking for it			0

recent abductions and violence have put security in @entity2 back in the news
yet millions visit @entity2 every year without incident
safety varies dramatically depending where you are and what you do
