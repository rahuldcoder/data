-- @entity1 has become the new front line in the contest over religion , health care and the workplace			1
@entity1 is a closely held , for - profit corporation that objects to covering contraception on religious grounds			1
it lost its lawsuit last october , but the ruling was stayed pending the @entity12 's decision on @entity13			2
now , @entity1 has a clear legal pathway to deny contraception coverage to its employees			1
@entity1 , however , is in a very different business than @entity13			1
it sells organic products , a market that relies on educated , well - informed , urban consumers , a demographic that trends liberal			1
in response to the renewed attention on the @entity1 case , defenders of the company , people who want to buy their products with a clean conscience , and the organic food stores who want to stay out of the crossfire , are all arguing that this is just a political dispute			1
this is not just another argument between the right and the left			0
instead , the situation raises complicated and competing ethical claims on which we do have to take a position			2
that 's not just my perspective ; it 's what @entity1 implies as well			1
@entity48 , the chairman and sole shareholder of @entity1 , is an interesting fellow			1
he considers contraceptives to be " lifestyle drugs , " links birth - control pills to @entity54 , and calls president @entity55 a dictator			2
he is a @entity57 , but rather than focusing on a religious principle , he said the government should n't be able to make him provide birth control , although his lawyer has since clarified the matter			2
in response to a flood of customer complaints , the company released a statement : " @entity1 is a principled food company			1
we were convinced that actions of the federal government were illegal , and so filed a formal objection			0
the recent @entity12 decision confirms , at least in part , that we were correct			0
we realized in making our objection that it would give rise to grotesque mischaracterizations and fallacious arguments			0
we did not fully anticipate the degree of maliciousness and corruption that would visit us			0
nevertheless , we believe we did what we should have			0
" look at that language			0
" @entity1 casts itself as the righteous victim , unjustly accused , a rhetorical move particularly popular among the @entity89 christian right wing			2
even when the @entity89 @entity12 has handed them a victory , they portray themselves as victimized , although they did not respond , beyond their prepared statement , to a request i made for examples for mischaracterizations , untrue arguments , or corruption			0
in the meantime , some consumers are demanding their stores stop carrying @entity1 , a complicated matter given the company 's solid niche in the market			1
organic food stores have tried to resolve their dilemma by dodging the question			1
@entity111 , for example , responded to a @entity113 petition on @entity1 with a statement , saying , " our primary consideration is whether the product 's ingredients meet our @entity118			1
" no one is questioning the quality , so @entity111 will continue stocking the products			1
@entity122 , a major food co-op in @entity123 , takes a slightly different path			2
they write , " while we are disappointed by @entity1 ' stand on this issue , @entity122 has a long - standing tradition of not engaging in boycotts that are called for political reasons			2
" that word " political " rings out			0
businesses are probably wise to stay out of politics much of the time , but they do stop buying products for ethical reasons			1
for example , when news broke about slave labor in the @entity143 shrimp industry , companies such as @entity138 and @entity139 acted to use their purchasing power to force change			0
for them , the ethics of slave labor , obviously , mandated action			0
i am not saying that the @entity1 case is analogous to slave labor , but only that is reasonable to demand your grocery store respond to ethical complaints			1
moreover , i base my conclusion that the issue at hand is ethical , and not political , on the statements coming from @entity1 itself			1
the company is n't demanding an exemption because of politics , or because it supports one party over another , or even to save money			1
instead , @entity170 officials claim that their position emerges out of their principles , their religious convictions , and that they are just trying to do the right thing			0
if we respect their claim , then we also have to respect the counter-argument			0
access to birth control and the protection of women 's rights likewise emerge from core principles			2
we are weighing competing ethical stances			2
there 's a bigger context of competing claims here			2
some religious people argue that their beliefs are under attack			0
many women , and those concerned with gender equality , argue that the birth - control issue is just a first step toward broader conservative attempt to police female sexuality			0
in the meantime , five conservative @entity57 men on the @entity12 have made a ruling			0
companies engaging in discriminatory practices and those who patronize them may be legally entitled to religious exemptions , but they are not exempt from the consequences of their actions			0
consumers , especially in the organic food market , often choose what to buy based on ethical principles			1
the stores they patronize should , too			0
join us on @entity215 / @entity214 .			0

@entity217 says an organic food producer , @entity1 , is at center of contest over religion
he says the company 's products appeal to progressives , but its policies on contraception do n't
*retailers* like @entity111 have resisted calls to drop the line of products
@entity217 : this is n't just about politics , but about ethical values
