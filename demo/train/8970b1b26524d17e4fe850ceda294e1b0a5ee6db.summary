-- will the future of the eurozone be decided at thousands of @entity3 across the continent ? that may be a stretch , but @entity7 and @entity8 are withdrawing billions of euros from their bank accounts and sending them somewhere " safer			1
" and they 're getting some encouragement , too			0
@entity14 , for example , is soliciting the money of @entity7 nervous about the solvency of banks at home			1
such nervousness is understandable , as the @entity7 government struggles to inject liquidity into the country 's fourth - largest bank -- @entity24 -- and other financial institutions weighed down by bad property loans			1
finance minister @entity27 admitted on @entity7 radio tuesday that the state has " a problem with access to the ( debt ) markets			1
" @entity7 officials say € 50 billion ( about $ 62 billion ) may be required to keep the country 's banks afloat			1
analysts at investment bank @entity38 believe the figure may be closer to € 120 billion			0
earlier this week , the @entity40 disclosed that the net outflow of capital in march was a record € 66.2 billion , twice as much as the previous peak in december			0
data from the @entity45 shows that in april deposits of individuals and companies held at @entity7 banks fell by € 31.5 billion ( $ 39 billion ) , though it 's unclear how much of that money may have gone abroad			1
on one day in may , @entity8 withdrew an estimated € 700 million euros from local banks -- scared that a " @entity54 " ( the now familiar shorthand for a disorderly @entity8 withdrawal from the eurozone ) would destroy their savings			1
the contagion has now spread to @entity59 , whose banks have made about € 23 billion in loans to @entity8 individuals and companies			1
last week , @entity59 president @entity65 pointedly would not rule out the need for @entity68 support in rescuing banks with high exposure to @entity8			1
@entity59 is the third smallest economy in the eurozone			0
@entity7 is the fourth largest			1
and given the brinkmanship between @entity7 's government and the @entity75 over how to rescue that country 's banks , @entity7 may well send more of their money to safe havens			1
( this is now becoming known as " @entity81			0
" ) @entity7 wants cash at low interest rates from the @entity45 , or @entity45 , pumped directly into its banks , because its own borrowing costs are so much higher -- the yield on its 10 - year bond was 6.4 % tuesday			1
speaking to the @entity7 senate tuesday , prime minister @entity89 for the first time called publicly for the creation of eurobonds			1
that puts him at odds with @entity96 chancellor @entity95 and the @entity45			0
put crudely , eurobonds would dilute @entity96 's fiscal strength in a pool of junk debt			0
the @entity45 governor , @entity101 , has indirectly accused @entity7 of underestimating the importance of its banking problem			2
in the words of one financial analyst , it 's like two cars racing toward each other on a single - track road			0
someone 's nerve has to give			0
the @entity45 has already plowed more than € 1 trillion into the @entity68 banking system since december in an effort to stimulate liquidity			2
that injection also helped lower @entity118 and @entity7 sovereign bond yields , as banks used some of the cash to snap up government debt			1
expect the @entity123 , which debuts next month armed with € 500 billion , to have plenty of suitors , even though it wo n't be allowed to lend directly to banks			0
a series of summits there was not much clue about the way forward after a conference call early tuesday among the finance ministers and central bank governors of the @entity135 , which includes the @entity136 , @entity96 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
a terse statement issued afterward said : " the g - 7 ministers and governors reviewed developments in the global economy and financial markets and the policy response under consideration , including the progress towards financial and fiscal union in @entity68			2
" next stop is the @entity151 summit in @entity152 , @entity153			0
it would be an unwieldy format for making a bold statement of intent on the eurozone -- especially as the meeting comes the day after the next @entity8 election			2
perhaps more important to the future of the single currency will be the @entity75 summit at the end of the month , june 28 - 29			1
@entity101 wants a @entity68 - wide " banking union " that would have powers akin to the @entity167 in the @entity136 and would deter a run on the most vulnerable banks in southern @entity68			1
speaking to @entity172 during a conference in @entity174 , the @entity171 's @entity170 said tuesday : " the master plan that everybody signs up to will be important because it will set a vision , it will set a collective determination			0
and that is lacking at the moment			0
" analysts say such a " master plan " would need to correct the eurozone 's schizophrenic structure : a single currency without a common fiscal policy or @entity68 - wide bond market			2
@entity188 , former chairman of the @entity189 in the @entity191 administration , summed up the root problem in a @entity194 article last week , saying , " the eurozone problem remains the locking together of very different economies into a monetary union without a way to adjust			0
" he added , " normally , exchange - rate adjustments would reduce this gap			0
... but without an exchange - rate safety valve you need an alternate way to rebalance economies			0
" for @entity96 , whose approval is needed for any initiative to protect @entity68 banks , there is at least a silver lining in the current crisis			1
as investors flee to safety , @entity96 's two - year bond pays effectively zero percent			0
in other words , it 's borrowing for free , quite possibly with the help of anxious @entity7			2
at least @entity68 have the @entity220 football tournament to distract them for the rest of this month , starting friday			2
in the last tournament -- in 2008 -- @entity7 defeated @entity96 in the final .			2

money is moving around @entity68 amid nervousness about the solvency of banks
@entity14 is soliciting the money of @entity7 as the @entity7 government struggles
contagion that caught up @entity8 is spreading to @entity234
a @entity75 summit at the end of june will be important for the future of the euro
