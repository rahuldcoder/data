-- for centuries , tales of the @entity2 , an elusive but terrifying creature said to roam the inhospitable @entity5 , have enthralled curious minds			1
now , research by a leading @entity9 geneticist may have unlocked the truth about the @entity2 , or @entity2 , after hair samples from two mystery animals proved to be a genetic match to an ancient polar bear			1
artist creates faces from dna left in public the findings , to be explained in " @entity20 , " a documentary series on @entity9 's @entity23 tv network , are the work of @entity25 , a professor of human genetics at @entity27			2
he put out a worldwide call last year for people to submit hair or other tissue from " cryptids , " or previously undescribed species , and collected more than 30 samples for analysis			1
@entity25 ' research focused on two samples in particular , both from the @entity38 but found about 800 miles apart , one in the @entity40 region and the other in @entity42			2

what @entity25 called an " exciting and completely unexpected result " casts new light on the @entity2 legend , although it may not satisfy the legions of " @entity61 " around the world			2
" there 's more work to be done on interpreting the results			0
i do n't think it means there are ancient polar bears wandering around the @entity38 , " @entity25 said			1
scientists map dna of prehistoric animal " but we can speculate on what the possible explanation might be			0
it could mean there is a subspecies of brown bear in the @entity38 descended from the bear that was the ancestor of the polar bear			1
or it could mean there has been more recent hybridization between the brown bear and the descendant of the ancient polar bear			1
" @entity25 ' dna testing forms part of the @entity27 - @entity89 , which is also looking for genetic evidence of other mysterious creatures -- including the @entity92 , or @entity20 , in the @entity93 and the @entity94 in @entity95 -- to study their possible links to humans			1
those who submitted samples to the project last year were asked to give a description of the material and details of where and when it was found , as well as their own opinion of its likely species type and the reasons for that view			2
@entity109 : ' dna was my only gold rush ' the analysis , which involves sophisticated dna testing and comparison of the findings with a database of other animals ' genomes , does n't come cheap , costing about $ 2,000 for each hair sample			0
but it may finally allow scientists to pin down whether all those @entity126 " sightings " over the years -- often captured in blurred photos or shaky video footage -- are based on fact , mistaken identity or elaborate hoaxes			0
@entity130 researchers to relaunch ' @entity20 ' search " ' @entity61 ' and other enthusiasts seem to think that they 've been rejected by science , " @entity25 is quoted as saying			0
" now i think that 's a complete distortion of what science is about			0
science does n't accept or reject anything			0
all it does is examine the evidence , and that is what i 'm doing			0
" @entity25 has submitted the dna results for publication in a peer - reviewed science journal and is also due to publish a book based on his research next year .			0
