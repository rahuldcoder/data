-- perhaps it 's just the nature of the cycles of pop music , but does n't it seem like @entity6 has been gone for a while ? her last album , " @entity10 , " came out in 2011 , but for some reason it seems like she 's been missing in action for twice that time			1
regardless , @entity6 is back with a vengeance			0
her new album 's first single and video , " @entity18 * * * h , " has already dropped , and yesterday she revealed that the new collection , which will be out december 3 , is called " @entity20			1
" before you go assuming that she 's making some sort of awesome meta - allusion to @entity25 's " @entity24 , " just know that " @entity27 " is actually @entity6 ' given middle name			1
call the governor , @entity6 lives fancy in ' @entity18 * * * h ' " it 's a personal album , and all my family , they all call me @entity20 , it 's like a term of endearment , and i just wanted to share that with my fans , " she told @entity32 's @entity31 yesterday			1
other details are relatively scarce , though we do know that @entity43 is serving as executive producer and that " @entity18 * * * h " does n't necessarily represent the album as a whole			0
is @entity6 ' ' @entity18 * * * h ' video too sexual ? director weighs in " that song is a reflection of @entity6 moreso than the album , " @entity50 told @entity51			2
" the album is what the album is , but we felt that song needed to come out to keep the foundation on what @entity6 represents			2
but it should n't reflect the albumâ € ” an album is a body of work as a collective			0
if we had to pick a song like , ' oh , what song fits every color of the record , ' you should n't do that ... we felt that song represents ' @entity75 , ' that @entity6 oomph			2
