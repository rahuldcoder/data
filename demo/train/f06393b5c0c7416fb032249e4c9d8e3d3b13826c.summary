by any measure it 's historic : the vast majority of @entity4 's leaders flying to @entity5 at the invite of the president , whose father was born on the continent , to mark what the @entity10 hopes is a new era of cooperation			1
while plans for the first @entity16 this week in the nation 's capital are ambitious , the reality is the @entity19 still has strides to make on the kind of political and economic relationships in @entity4 that can benefit both sides			1
other nations , namely @entity25 , have turned their focus to the continent as a trade partner			1
terrorist networks have expanded their reach in some countries , most notably in @entity31 , where hundreds of schoolgirls remain at large after being kidnapped earlier this year			0
and while @entity19 - backed efforts have helped slow the spread of @entity36 , countries there rate among the lowest in life expectancy and infant mortality			1
" the importance of this for @entity19 needs to be understood , " president @entity39 said on friday about the summit			1
he added later that @entity4 " happens to be one of the continents where @entity19 is most popular and people feel a real affinity for our way of life			2
" here are five reasons that the @entity19 - @entity51 , which kicked off on monday , is important : 1			1
health scare : the health problems in @entity4 were underscored this week when an @entity55 outbreak prompted leaders of two nations to cancel their trips to @entity5			1
@entity61 president @entity60 , a @entity63 winner , and @entity64 , the leader of @entity65 , both said they would remain in their countries			0
@entity55 has killed more than 700 people in three nations : @entity69 , @entity61 and @entity70			0
summit leaders , and even @entity39 , have stressed there is no risk to @entity74 from those arriving from @entity4 this week			2
@entity39 said anyone who might have been exposed to the virus would be screened both in their home countries and upon arrival in the @entity19			2
but worry over the worsening outbreak only highlighted challenges @entity4 faces in combating disease and poverty , despite the billions in @entity19 aid over the years			1
" this is an uphill challenge for them , " said @entity85 , @entity39 's senior director for development and @entity87 , noting both @entity61 and @entity65 had recently emerged from periods of civil war			2
@entity39 hopes to move past the traditional elements of humanitarian aid to @entity4 , focusing instead on potential trade			2
but promoting commercial ties with countries engulfed in @entity55 outbreaks could prove to be difficult			0
the @entity98 warned against non-essential travel to @entity65 and @entity100 last week , and some schools and businesses have closed			0
" the timing is very unfortunate , and no one would have wished for this , " said @entity103 , an associate professor of international affairs at @entity105			0
" having high - level discussions between the @entity19 and @entity4 on business and investment are infrequent			1
so to the extent that this distracts from that i think will be regretted all around			0
security challenges : another potential barrier to @entity19 investment in @entity4 : growing extremism on the continent , which has overwhelmed certain governments			1
the most flagrant example came earlier this summer , when the group @entity122 kidnapped more than 200 school girls in @entity31			0
the incident prompted international outrage and so far , a @entity19 - backed team has not located them			1
@entity31 - based @entity122 opposes western - style education , and there are fears the group 's influence could be crossing borders			1
last month , armed gunman suspected to be @entity122 militants abducted the wife of @entity138 's deputy prime minister			2
@entity31 has expressed frustration with @entity138 for not doing enough to fight @entity122 on its side of the border , a charge @entity138 has denied			0
the unrest has inflicted damage on @entity147 economies , including @entity31 's , the largest on the continent			1
other @entity147 nations combating violent extremism , like @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 , are also tough sells for @entity19 investment			1
many of those nations want more @entity19 assistance to counter militants , sentiments likely to be expressed at this week 's summit			1
" we are concerned about efforts by terrorist groups to gain a foothold in @entity4 , " said @entity161 , @entity39 's deputy national security adviser			2
he pointed to @entity19 counterterror efforts that aim to partner with nations in stemming unrest			2
" we 're looking at how do we get at the broader issue of countering violent extremism in @entity4 so that these groups , like @entity122 , like @entity171 , like @entity172 , are not able to prey on young people with disinformation and intimidation , " he said			0
countering @entity25 : the @entity19 has some catching up to do in @entity4 when it comes to trade and investment			1
@entity25 's imports of @entity147 oil and natural minerals have skyrocketed over the past two decades			1
alongside have come massive @entity25 investments in @entity147 infrastructure and construction projects , manned by waves of @entity25 workers who ended up remaining in @entity4			1
more than a million @entity25 citizens now live there			2
" @entity4 is in a very particular moment , economically speaking , " said @entity103 during an interview with @entity190 from @entity191			0
" the continent has been growing very fast			2
demographically , there 's a bulge in terms of it 's youth population			2
" @entity39 wants to make sure the @entity19 is one of those partners , and a more attractive one than @entity25			1
" my advice to @entity147 leaders is to make sure that if , in fact , @entity25 is putting in roads and bridges , number one , that they 're hiring @entity147 workers ; number two , that the roads do n't just lead from the mine to the port to @entity213 , but that there 's an ability for the @entity147 governments to shape how this infrastructure is going to benefit them in the long term , " @entity39 told @entity208 last week			1
cementing legacy : @entity39 's two predecessors both secured legacy achievements in @entity4 -- @entity223 through his @entity224 , and @entity225 through his program combating @entity227			0
@entity39 similarly hopes for a way to leave his mark on the continent after he leaves office , though his status as the first president of @entity147 descent has already made history			1
that fact led some @entity147 to regard @entity39 with outsized expectations when he took office in 2009 , leading to some disappointment that he has n't focused more on shoring up @entity19 - @entity4 ties			1
during his time in office , @entity39 has focused on terrorism , uprisings in the @entity246 world , @entity248 provocations , and the much - awaited pivot to @entity250			0
@entity39 made his first presidential trip to @entity4 in 2009 when he visited @entity252			0
he did n't return again until 2013 with tour of @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256			0
he 's embarked upon an initiative that aims to bring electricity to more @entity147 , and a program supporting young leaders working toward @entity262 governments			1
both are elements to a legacy designed to shore up conditions for individuals on the continent			0
and the summit itself , while not expected to produce any large - scale trade agreements , is meant to signal a shift from purely humanitarian assistance to a two - way partnership			1
" we believe it can be a game - changer in the @entity19 - @entity4 relationship , " @entity161 said of the summit			1
not invited : while the bulk of @entity4 's leaders will be in @entity5 , the continent 's most reviled leaders wo n't be attending			1
they include @entity284 's @entity283 and @entity286 's @entity285			0
they were n't invited because of their alleged human rights abuses			0
other controversial leaders -- like @entity152 's @entity291 , accused of crimes at the @entity293 -- will attend			2
like any major diplomatic gathering , the @entity294 has been an exercise in protocol and careful planning			0
instead of meeting with leaders separately , @entity39 has been scheduled for larger group discussions , to the disappointment of some who wanted to talk to him one - on - one			2
" we just would n't be able to do bilats with everybody , and so the simplest thing is for the president to devote his time to engaging broadly with all the leaders			0
that way we 're not singling out individuals at the expense of the other leaders , " @entity161 said			0
he noted @entity39 would speak with each leader individually during a dinner at the @entity10 on tuesday			0
that event has taken on state dinner - type proportions , with a large tent constructed on the @entity319			0
organizers have the added stress of accommodating leaders of 50 nations , all with varied religious and cultural sensitivities that must be respected			0
for example , servers must know who drinks alcohol and who abstains for religious reasons			0
it 's a reflection of just how diverse @entity4 is , and how high the stakes are for @entity39 as he forges new relationships there .			0

majority of @entity147 leaders *convene* in @entity5 for first - ever @entity147 leaders summit
*ebola* outbreak on the continent sure to distract from talks on trade
@entity19 hopes to be a player on the @entity147 continent and blunt @entity25 's influence
