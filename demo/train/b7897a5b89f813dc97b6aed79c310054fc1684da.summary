@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was helping her daughters prepare for school the morning she heard the gunshots			1
unfamiliar with the sound , she thought maybe children were throwing rocks outside			2
her curiosity drew her to the balcony of the family 's third floor apartment in the quiet @entity0 suburb of @entity15 , where she found her husband 's colleague standing next to his car , panic - stricken			2
" they hit him , " he cried out			2
as she rushed downstairs , her mind raced			0
" at the beginning , i thought maybe they hit him with a stone or a knife , but not with a gunshot , " @entity3 explained			1
after all , it would n't be the first time @entity3 's husband , attorney and opposition leader @entity34 , had been assaulted in broad daylight			1
it was only a few days earlier that a mob of radical @entity38 attacked him during a meeting of the @entity41 in @entity42 , a town about 160 kilometers ( 100 miles ) southwest of @entity0			1
" one month before his death , as he was leaving a cafe in @entity48 in @entity0 , a number of people came looking for him and shouting his name while holding sticks in their hands , " @entity3 added			1
as the most visible leader of @entity1 's @entity54 -- a coalition of a dozen leftist political parties formed last october -- @entity34 had been tasked with countering the rise of the @entity38 - led @entity57 , which swept into power following the revolution that toppled longtime president @entity61 @entity60 in january 2011			1
@entity34 had prepared for leadership from an early age			0
he was a legend of @entity1 's student movements and eventually founded the leftist @entity66 party			1
a lifelong human rights advocate , he championed democratic reform , secularism , and vehemently confronted the rise of radicalism			0
and as a result , he and his family were often the target of death threats , harassment , and on occasion , violence at the hands of his political opponents			1
" he was being watched before the revolution			0
after the revolution he got direct and written threats			0
the last threats came from the mosques , in which the @entity86 there called for him to be killed , " @entity3 says			1
" they always used me and the two girls to threaten @entity34			0
he used to tell me about these threats in his own way in order not to put fear in us			0
" but as @entity95 approached her husband slumped in his car , she discovered the worst			2
" i found him in the car			0
it was locked but all the windows were broken			0
i saw the traces of gunshots , and at that time , my only concern was to save him			0
but i made sure not to touch anything in the car for the sake of investigation			0
" the assailants , according to witnesses , had waited for @entity34 to emerge from his home			0
as he got into his car , a gunman approached and fired four shots which struck @entity34 in the head and chest , then fled by motorcycle with the help of an accomplice driver			0
" opposite to us , there was a medic			0
he lived next door ... he was also worried so i calmed him down			0
my only concern at that time was taking @entity34 to the hospital as soon as possible			0
" not long after the shooting , @entity34 was pronounced dead at a nearby clinic			0
but this was n't just another politically motivated murder in another unstable @entity131 country			0
prior to @entity34 's murder on february 6 , @entity1 had been widely hailed as the poster child of the @entity134			1
having ousted @entity60 and having held free and fair elections , and while their @entity131 counterparts in @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity140 continued to struggle under the rule of dictators desperately clinging to power , @entity1 was setting the precedent for democratic transition in the modern @entity131 world			1
and though president @entity147 pledged @entity149 's " odious assassination " would not derail @entity1 's democratic transition - it did just that			1
the assassination , the first time since @entity1 's independence in 1956 that a politician had been the target inside the country , set off a wave of political setbacks which caused a security vacuum , creating a vicious cycle of instability that has come to characterize , and still plagues , @entity134 nations in their post-dictator transitions			1
building on an already growing dissent against the @entity168 party , the opposition immediately took to the streets following @entity34 's death			1
three days of persistent outrage by hordes of @entity174 supporters forced prime minister @entity175 to the negotiating table			0
he proposed handing over key ministries , such as justice and foreign affairs , to independents in an attempt to form a more inclusive government and avoid further political instability and pledged to step down if his efforts were not successful			1
but despite gaining broad support from the general public and the opposition , @entity175 also succeeded in alienating himself from his party 's most - ardent supporters			1
just 13 days after the @entity174 assassination , @entity175 resigned as prime minister			2
on february 22 , ruling party leaders elected serving interior minister @entity193 to replace @entity175			1
@entity193 had been a founding member of @entity168 and its spokesman from 1981 until 1990 when he was imprisoned by the @entity60 regime			0
a party loyalist and hardliner , the election of @entity193 signaled the @entity38 - led party had no intentions of relinquishing any substantial power			1
few @entity1 had probably heard of @entity3 before her husband 's death , but in the last two months she has attained rock star status in her country			1
leftist supporters clearly lacking the charismatic charm and leadership that died with @entity34 , rallied behind @entity3 who was adored for her strength and determination immediately following her loss			1
it was n't long before the widow would become the new face of @entity1 's opposition			1
turn on the television or open a newspaper in @entity1 and chances are @entity95 's picture will be there			1
" the number of people who attended the funeral and the spotlight i am put under has increased the amount of responsibility i am feeling			0
the whole thing has changed the destiny i have chosen , and yet i feel i am in the middle of the way , " @entity3 says as she clutches tissues with one hand and constantly fiddles with a charm on her necklace bearing the image of her late husband with the other			1
being a political celebrity was not part of @entity95 's plan			1
she had long ago left her activist life behind to raise her family			0
like her husband , @entity95 was a leader in @entity1 's student movement in the @entity248 of the @entity249 , a group of leftist and nationalist students concerned with the rising @entity38 presence on campus			1
following her time at university , she went on to join the @entity254 , a prominent part of the @entity60 opposition			2
" the negativity here is that i am a person who dislikes spotlights			0
my concern is my daughters , but now i feel the amount of responsibility towards the people of @entity1			1
i do n't want to collapse , for the sake of @entity1			1
i feel proud for spreading courage in the atmosphere			0
@entity57 wants to spread fear and i want to stop that feeling , " @entity3 says			1
as she spoke , a local @entity1 tv station was still breaking down its equipment which cluttered her modest apartment			2
soon , another would arrive for yet another interview where she would , once again , relive the morning that changed her life			0
" undoubtedly , his death is a loss to me and to our two daughters			2
to me , he was a husband , friend , colleague in the same party and profession			2
" later that week , @entity95 and thousands of supporters donning @entity34 masks and carrying posters bearing @entity34 's trademark mustache and mole , an image which has come to represent the revival of revolutionary fervor in @entity1 , gathered at her husband 's graveside			1
@entity34 's father and members of the @entity54 addressed the crowd flooding the @entity0 cemetery over a loudspeaker between chants of " who killed @entity34 ? " rally leaders then marched to @entity304 , named in honor of the street vendor who lit himself on fire which triggered @entity1 's revolution			2
the square was soon filled from curb to curb with activists			0
barbed wire lined the streets as hundreds of @entity1 police , equipped with batons and riot gear , looked on suspiciously			2
that afternoon , the eager crowd lining @entity319 , the birthplace of the @entity134 , parted as a large truck crept past , draping behind it a giant , cascading @entity1 flag			2
coming to a stop in the center of @entity304 , @entity95 emerged from behind the flag to address to thousands of supporters and well - wishers			0
the day ended without incident , a stark contrast from the funeral procession for @entity34 that just a few weeks earlier had ended in violent clashes between supporters of the leftist martyr and those of the ruling @entity57			2
though the opposition was able to display its newfound strength without backlash , it was just another day without justice for @entity95			2
despite her obvious fatigue , she refuses to rest until those that are responsible for her husband 's death are brought to justice			1
but buried beneath the sadness and anger , @entity95 still clings to hope			0
" i still feel optimistic as he was before he died			0
he once said , " if they assassinate me , a flower will grow			0
" now , thousands of flowers have grown in @entity1			2

widow of opposition leader *reluctantly* became a @entity1 political celebrity
@entity3 is *inspiring* opposition to the ruling @entity38 party
what she really wants is justice for her assassinated husband
his death was the first political assassination in @entity1 since 1956 independence
