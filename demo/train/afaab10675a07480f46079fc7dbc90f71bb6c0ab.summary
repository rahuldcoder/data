-- a last - ditch effort to put an end to the bloodshed in @entity4 failed on saturday , with @entity5 and @entity6 exercising their veto at the @entity9			1
with that fateful decision , the conflict moved to another , more dangerous stage			1
those who warn that @entity4 will descend into civil war are a bit behind : it is already in civil war			1
now it will only intensify			2
in the months leading up to the @entity9 vote , @entity4 's opposition has grown more militarized			1
rebel forces , under the banner of the @entity23 , gained considerable traction after a shaky start			2
the @entity9 's failure to act may have been the best recruiting tool the @entity23 could have hoped for , and its ascendancy is now a nearly foregone conclusion			1
meanwhile , after first opposing any resort to armed resistance , the @entity35 , the country 's most representative opposition body , has made an important shift			2
it has now " pledged to support " the @entity23 , and the two groups are attempting to increase coordination			2
where does that leave the international community ? the @entity9 - endorsed norm of " responsibility to protect " ( sometimes boiled down to " r2p " ) mandates a collective response when states wage war on their own populations			1
the @entity4 regime , however , is making a mockery of the notion , with its brutal assault on the city of @entity55 just as the @entity9 vote was taking place			1
either the international community takes r2p seriously , or it does n't			2
as i 've argued before , military intervention remains premature			0
but , in light of recent events , the time has come to carefully consider the various military options available , determine their feasibility , and begin to judge whether they would cause more good than harm			0
of course , no one should take such intervention lightly			0
but just as proponents of intervention must make their case for how the military option could " work , " opponents of intervention face a similar burden of explaining how staying the current course will work			0
if the opposition itself has chosen the military option -- and this seems increasingly the case -- then the question is this : can a ragtag army of perhaps 10,000 @entity4 rebels defeat an army that while , far from invincible , enjoys an overwhelming advantage in numbers , equipment and firepower ? the opposition may have millions on their side , with @entity4 continuing to protest en masse throughout the country			1
but it 's difficult to see anything less than a disastrous stalemate without the international community helping to tip the balance			0
no one , to my knowledge , is advocating for an @entity104 - style invasion with tens of thousands of @entity106 boots on the ground			0
the options being considered are far more limited -- funding and arming the @entity23 , establishing " safe zones " in the north and a targeted air mission to weaken the @entity4 military 's capabilities			1
to be sure , all of these are serious forms of military intervention , but bringing up the specter of @entity104 can be misleading , just as it was in @entity121			0
so we find ourselves in an odd but increasingly common situation , where @entity4 themselves are more enthusiastic about foreign military intervention than @entity106 are			1
it is , in this sense , the reverse of @entity104 , which was rightly seen by many as a tragic @entity131 imposition			0
here , it is @entity4 themselves who are pleading for the international community to come to their aid			1
in december , the @entity35 " formally endorsed " foreign intervention			0
if they formally request military assistance -- presumably the next step -- we have a moral responsibility to take it seriously			0
unless the @entity142 regime suddenly implodes -- a possibility , but an unlikely one -- this is the direction in which we are heading			2
the " anti-imperialists " will , as they often do , cry foul			0
this time , though , they will find themselves on the wrong side			0
none of the @entity131 powers has come out in even tepid support of military intervention			0
consumed by their own internal problems , this is not at all something they want			0
but it may be something the @entity4 people need			1
follow @entity162 on @entity163 join the conversation on @entity165 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			1

@entity168 : the vetoes of the @entity9 *resolution* on @entity4 send the conflict to a new , more dangerous phase
he says nations are supposed to take collective action when a regime wars against its own people
@entity168 says the west does n't want to intervene militarily in @entity4 , even though @entity4 want that help
