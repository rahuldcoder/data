the teacher stood in the classroom , face - to - face with his 16 - year - old student , who was holding a shotgun			1
@entity5 , 40 , talked to the teen , trying to persuade him to end an armed assault in which one student had already been shot			1
@entity5 had no idea whether the student -- whose pockets were filled with ammunition -- would put the gun down or pull the trigger			2
campus supervisor @entity15 helped distract the teen , allowing other students in the classroom to escape , while @entity5 talked to him , according to @entity20 affiliate @entity19			1
eventually , the teen let go of the gun , and police took him into custody			1
that was how police described the frightening situation thursday at @entity27 , about 30 miles outside @entity28 , @entity29			1
" to stand there and face someone that has a shotgun , who 's already discharged it and shot a student , speaks volumes for these two young men and what they may have prevented , " @entity31 sheriff @entity30 said thursday			1
@entity5 , however , hates the term hero			2
he told @entity20 friday that he does n't want to be labeled anything except " teacher			1
" classes were canceled for friday , the school website said , and on - campus counseling was being made available for students in the morning			1
the wounded student was in critical but stable condition thursday night , and the shooter was in custody , police said			1

@entity5 , who teaches science , is known as a well - liked teacher at the school , according to his father , @entity72			1
he is himself a graduate of @entity73 , where he played football and served as student body president			1
@entity72 was n't surprised that his son played a key role in defusing the situation , saying @entity5 makes a point of getting to know his students -- including the suspected gunman -- on a personal level			2
" because he knows the boy and the boy knows him ... i attribute that to why the boy talked and listened to my son , " @entity72 said			0
" it 's all about kindness			0
it 's all about my son being kind and caring about his students that makes this successful			2
" @entity72 also said his son , who was standing just a few feet away from the student who was shot , had been hit in the head with a shot pellet , but was fine and did n't seek treatment for it			2
nonetheless , @entity5 will be coping mentally with a difficult situation , his father said , adding his son slept little thursday night			0
" this was a very upsetting incident , " @entity72 said , describing his son as " emotionally worn out			0
" " it was hard for him			0
... but he 's come to the conclusion that he did everything he could do			0
" @entity5 told @entity20 that it was n't just his students he was worried about as he faced the gunman -- it was also his wife , who works in the business office of the school , and his two sons , ages 5 and 3 , at home			1
as the school went into lockdown amid the shooting , @entity5 's wife texted him from her office , reminding him to lock his classroom door			2
his response , according to his father , " the shooter is in my room			0
" @entity5 said the ordeal has really made him want to come home to his family			0
the @entity73 shooting is the latest incident of gun violence that launched a fiery national debate over whether teachers should be armed			1
last month the @entity131 called on communities to arm teachers or place armed guards in schools as a solution following a @entity138 , @entity139 , shooting spree in which a 20 - year - old gunman killed seven adults and 20 children at an elementary school			2
" the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun , " said the @entity131 's @entity144			0
the idea has been rejected by teacher 's groups and mayors , including @entity155 's @entity154 , @entity157 's @entity156 and @entity159 's @entity158			0
related : @entity131 clarifies its stance on arming schools the debate prompted @entity20 commenter @entity163 to weigh in thursday , saying , " so let me get this straight			0
the @entity131 wants to have police officers in schools ... yet an unarmed teacher talked a student into surrendering his gun			1
besides being one heck of a hero , that teacher just might have some advice for the @entity131			2
" another @entity20 commenter , @entity175 , countered : " well if the schools are armed and another nut shows up he gets shot ! problem solved ! " in @entity180 it 's been legal for a dozen years for teachers to be armed in class			0
since the law took effect , there have been no school shootings in the state , nor accidents or incidents involving educators ' firearms			0
immediately after the @entity73 shooting thursday , amid the frenzy of desperate parents coming to the school to retrieve their children , parents expressed concern about school security			1
" it just goes to show you that we 're going to have to do a lot more to protect our students in this small town , " an unidentified parent told @entity19			0
" it might be a small environment , but there 's always that one bad apple			0
