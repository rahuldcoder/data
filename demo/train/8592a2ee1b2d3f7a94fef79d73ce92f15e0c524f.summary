-- at a hacker conference no one is safe			1
demographic of @entity5 conference for hackers is older , wiser and employed			1
when i first went to @entity5 in 1995 , the halls were mobbed with teenagers and attendees seemed more concerned with freeing @entity11 and seeing strippers than hacking each others ' computers			1
jump forward to @entity5 17 this year , which was held over the weekend in @entity17 , things certainly have changed			1
the attendees are older and wiser and employed , most of the feds are n't in stealth mode , and even the most savvy of hackers is justifiably paranoid			2
" welcome to the hacker world , " said @entity5 founder @entity23			1
the evolving demographic of @entity5 attendees shows that the hacker community , like all of us , is aging			1
but it 's also a reflection of how the threat landscape has changed			2
web site defacements have given way to much more serious risks like financial fraud and unaddressed critical infrastructure weaknesses			2
it 's a cornucopia of phishing e-mails , cross-site scripting attacks that poke holes in trusted web sites , and criminals harvesting credit card numbers and selling them on the underground equivalent of @entity45 with guarantees of service and support			2
@entity5 and @entity49 , the pricier and more corporate sister confab held the two days preceding @entity5 ( $ 120 for @entity5 registration versus $ 1,395 to $ 2,095 for phased registration at @entity49 ) , offer a forum for researchers to share information about vulnerabilities they find in software , hardware and systems			1
targeted this year were everything from the @entity62 and surveillance video feeds to e-parking meters and security underlying the @entity65			0
vendors and users were n't the only ones who need worry			0
attendees had plenty to fear and security experts themselves were n't spared			1
on july 27 , web sites belonging to a handful of security researchers and groups were hacked and passwords , private e-mails , @entity82 chats , and potentially sensitive documents were exposed on the vandalized site of security golden boy @entity85			2
( @entity11 , whose jailing in the ' 90s for computer crimes made him a cause celebre at " @entity11 " benefits at @entity5 at the time , was among those attacked			1
) there were more widespread threats at the shows , too			0
anyone using the @entity98 networks at the events had better be careful lest they get their password sniffed and posted on the @entity102			1
then there was the usb thumb drive that was passed around among attendees of @entity49 that was found to be infected with the @entity107 virus			1
reporters who are n't nearly as geeky as the sources they interview are always easy prey			0
one reporter was concerned about being hacked via the local area network in the press room after a rare @entity114 crashed his laptop			0
last year , three @entity117 men were expelled for sniffing the press room lan at @entity49			0
they said they had obtained @entity120 's and @entity0 's passwords but failed to prove the @entity0 allegation			2
this year , three @entity122 registered as press were ejected for asking questions that led organizers to believe were on an intelligence - gathering mission instead of merely reporting , according to the @entity127			0
i had a panic of my own at @entity5 this year			1
i was connected to the @entity131 using an @entity133 wireless card and a virtual private network and was startled a short while later when a web page opened up out of the blue and i noticed the @entity137 was disconnected			0
granted it looked like a legitimate page for my wireless carrier , but not wanting to take any chances i immediately logged off			0
( see " @entity5 : what to leave at home and other do 's and don'ts " for tips on how to best protect yourself			1
) unfortunately , i had neglected to disable the @entity98 on the laptop			1
because @entity151 event logging is lacking , it 's not clear whether someone may have spoofed the name of a wireless network the laptop is configured to automatically connect to			0
time to call the help desk			0
at least i did n't use any automatic teller machines at the hotel			2
@entity5 organizers confirmed on monday that a fake @entity159 was discovered in a lobby of the @entity161 where the event was held , right near the hotel security office			1
the ruse was up after someone looked through the camera hole using a flashlight and saw a pc inside			1
meanwhile , @entity169 , a security expert who works at @entity170 , reported on @entity171 that he lost $ 200 from a compromised atm at the @entity173 over the weekend			2
there are multiple @entity175 with the skimmers inside at the @entity178 casino , he tweeted , later adding : " @entity179 just called back			2
they 're taking it seriously , reading between the lines it seem ( s ) like there 's more going on here			0
" there is no evidence that the fake @entity187 was planted by anyone at @entity5 , and in all likelihood the hacked @entity159 was not associated with the hacker show			1
heightening the paranoia at @entity5 was the report from event organizers on saturday that there was a confirmed @entity195 on the @entity196 the conference hands out to all attendees			1
the report turned out to be false			0
also arousing suspicion were the @entity5 badges , which featured a built - in microphone , led , digital signal processor , and custom circuit boards designed to be hacked as part of a contest			1
i prudently popped the battery out of my badge after discussing the microphone capability with another journalist			0
some attendees chose not to wear the badges at all , even without the battery , tucking them in satchels and digging them out every time they needed to display them			2
as it does every year , @entity5 also had its share of stupid attendee tricks -- one arrest reportedly for carrying a concealed weapon and another for bungee jumping off the hotel roof			1
but those are par for the course when you mix booze and rebellious youth trying to out - impress each other			0
it was the other stuff -- the hacking and viruses and sniffing -- that made me and others at the show jumpy			0
security guru @entity236 , however , brushed it off as the mere cost of doing business			0
" this is the way hackers play , " he said			0
" this is the experimental battlefield			0
it 's not bad ; it is just what it is			0
@entity5 has an important place in computer security			1
