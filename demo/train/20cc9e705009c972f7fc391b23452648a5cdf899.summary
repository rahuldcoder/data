-- true crime stories are usually messier than fiction : they may be considered " solved " but still raise questions that ca n't be answered			1
that is true of @entity0 's five - part series , " taken : the coldest case ever solved			1
" readers delved into the details like armchair detectives			1
many amateur sleuths told us they devoured the tale of the 1957 kidnapping and murder of @entity16 in a single sitting			1
then they filled the comments sections with some very good questions			1
we know some of the answers			1
but other mysteries remain , perhaps forever			2
such is the nature of cold cases			1
question 1 : strange , the guy knew the girls , being their neighbor , while they did n't know him ? and in a small town where everybody knew everybody else ? several readers asked why @entity32 did n't know or recognize @entity16 as the kidnapper who called himself " @entity36 , " especially if he lived a couple of blocks away in this small town			1
he certainly seemed to know who @entity38 was			2
perhaps the answer has to do with the difference in their ages			2
think back to when you were a kid			0
do you remember any of the teenagers from your neighborhood ? @entity16 , or @entity16 as he was later known , had more reason to know and remember the @entity53 and @entity32 families			1
@entity38 's sisters put on backyard plays , and he told @entity0 that he recalled attending one as a boy			1
an old newspaper account reveals a strange twist : at the age of 8 , @entity44 was struck by a taxicab driven by @entity32 's father			1
police and prosecutors say @entity44 had an eerie fixation with @entity38			0
question 2 : if only police had let @entity32 get a look at @entity44 in 1957 , this whole case might have turned out differently			1
why did n't they ? @entity0 was unable to obtain all of the police and @entity73 reports -- some remain under seal			0
so it can not be fully explained why @entity32 never got a look at @entity44 at the time			0
he did not have a criminal record then , so there would have been no mug shot			0
later , @entity32 told us , she was never allowed inside the @entity44 house after the kidnapping			0
she wonders now if there were too many secrets inside			0
was his mother afraid she 'd make the connection ? answers to many questions can be found in @entity0 's evidence gallery it is clear from reading local news accounts that there was a strong feeling among local law enforcement officials that the kidnapping must have been the work of someone passing through town			1
that bias likely shaped the investigation			0
@entity16 did pass a polygraph test on december 10 , 1957 , and the @entity73 agent who administered the test believed that a teenager would not have been able to hide his involvement			1
the day after he was cleared , @entity44 left town and joined the @entity110			0
he returned four years later , but by then @entity32 and her family were living on the other side of town			1
question 3 : @entity32 described " @entity36 " as having long blond hair but the photos show him with brown hair			0
black and white photographs make hair appear to be darker than it is , particularly the hair color popularly known as " dishwater blond			0
" question 4 : what time did it get dark outside ? this question stirred considerable debate ; it deals with the disputed time of the kidnapping and whether @entity32 could get a good look at the kidnapper			0
the sun goes down early in @entity129 in december , by about 4:20 p.m. whether the kidnapping occurred before 6:20 p.m. , as police believe , or about 7 p.m. , as the defense contends , does n't matter : it would have been dark either way			1
question 5 : what was the " @entity135 " @entity38 's father was watching when she went back inside for her doll ? and what time did it come on ? could n't this information help establish the time of the kidnapping ? @entity53 told the @entity73 that he had started watching " @entity142 " or perhaps some " @entity144 " frontier show at about 6:30 p.m. , after @entity38 had gone out to play			1
this is consistent with a reader 's research that " @entity142 " began at 6:30 p.m. @entity148			2
it is not clear whether the @entity73 ever verified when the show aired , but @entity0 does not have the full set of @entity73 reports			0
hundreds of pages remain under seal by the agency , which cites " ongoing investigations			0
" question 6 : why was @entity38 not reported missing until 8:10 p.m. ? the @entity53 family 's @entity73 interviews indicate that they conducted a thorough search of the neighborhood before contacting the authorities			2
@entity38 's father , @entity161 , used a whistle to call her			2
@entity38 had a tendency to wander off			0
her father was embarrassed about a year earlier when she wandered away and turned up just as a search party was being organized			0
her brother , @entity166 , also later expressed regret that he did not wave down a passing patrol car while they searched for her			0
question 7 : i remember this case well			1
it reminded me of the @entity174 sisters , which happened a year before			0
why did n't these people keep a better eye on their children ? we have no way of knowing what @entity32 and @entity38 's parents knew about the @entity174 case , but the crime was well known in the @entity186 area			1
the @entity174 sisters were older and lived much closer to the city			0
@entity189 and @entity174 , ages 15 and 13 , vanished in december 1956 on the way to see the @entity192 movie " @entity193			0
" their bodies were found in a field in january 1957			2
the @entity174 case remains unsolved to this day			2
@entity16 was aware of the @entity174 case ; he mentioned it to an @entity110 recruiter on december 4 , 1957			1
according to the @entity73 report , he " appeared well - read on the @entity174 murder			0
" he also mentioned that he was glad he was n't in @entity201 the previous night because a little girl had gone missing			0
he added that he 'd never be considered a suspect in the @entity201 case because his girlfriend 's father was a deputy sheriff , the @entity73 reports state			1
question 8 : i 'm curious about a part of this story that was n't elaborated on , the disappearance of his daughter			0
is he a suspect in that as well ? @entity216 vanished in 2005 at age 34 ; her body was identified in june 2013			0
she was found in the drainage ditch of a golf course in @entity221 , @entity222 , shortly after she disappeared			0
but the body was so badly decomposed it went unidentified for years			2
police are investigating the case as a homicide but are saying little else			2
@entity16 and his wife , @entity228 , say he was in @entity230 at the time @entity216 vanished			1
he says he could not afford to go to @entity222 to search for her			0
finally , the @entity16 case is but one mystery among thousands , as two readers reminded us			1
they provided a list of some of the cold cases involving girls and teens from @entity242 , where @entity16 lived for decades			1
they want his dna checked			0
we cross-checked our readers ' lists with the @entity248 and @entity249			2
i 'd be surprised if every cop with a cold case on his desk has n't already checked @entity254 , the national dna database , where @entity257 's dna profile now resides			1
but in the meantime , here 's a complete list of cold cases involving women in @entity242			1
the oldest dates back to 1973			2
while our list might not be complete , it 's worth taking a moment to remember these lost girls : the missing : @entity268 , age 18 , 1973 @entity270 , 17 , 1974 @entity271 , 13 , 1974 @entity272 , 20 , 1975 @entity273 , 12 , 1979 @entity274 , 16 , 1979 @entity275 , 12 , 1979 @entity276 , 14 , 1981 @entity278 @entity277 , 16 , 1982 @entity279 , 15 , 1983 @entity280 , 19 , 1983 @entity281 , 18 , 1983 @entity282 , 15 , 1984 @entity283 , 13 , 1985 @entity284 , 18 , 1987 @entity285 , 16 , 1990 the dead : @entity287 , 13 , 1986 @entity288 , 12 , 1986 @entity289 , 14 , 1987 @entity290 , 17 , 1982 @entity291 , 16 , 1991 @entity292 , 10 , 2006 @entity293 , 14 , 1991 @entity294 , 15 , 1988 @entity295 , 15 , 1988 @entity296 , 14 , 1992 @entity297 , 16 , 1987 @entity298 , 17 , 1990 @entity299 , 16 , 1988 @entity300 , 18 , 1990			2

@entity16 , 7 , was abducted and murdered in 1957
@entity16 was *convicted* 55 years later but questions linger
*timeline* , alibi and other details of the nation 's oldest cold case still in dispute
