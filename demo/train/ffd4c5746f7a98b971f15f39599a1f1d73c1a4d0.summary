freaked out from funny hats			0
the nonstop insanity that occurs every four years at presidential party conventions is a given			0
and next week 's @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , is no exception			1
convention - goers will need a break			1
can you sneak away for an hour ? check out a free , self - guided walking tour of public art among the @entity17 area 's shining modern skyscrapers			1
after you download a map and an audio podcast , you 're ready to hit the sidewalk			0
the starting point is at @entity22 and @entity24 streets , a stone 's throw from the @entity28 convention hall			1
at @entity29 , you 'll see four statues created by @entity32 's @entity31 -- representing commerce , industry , transportation and the future			1
farther along the tour , you 'll come across sculptures by @entity40 artist @entity39			1
outside the @entity41 , take part in a tradition			0
join countless others who 've had their photo taken with the @entity47 sculpture			0
the outdoor work stands 18 feet tall , and it 's covered with thousands of tiles of mirrored glass			2
an hour might give you just enough time to see the @entity54 plane that pilot @entity55 made famous in 2009			0
a bird strike forced @entity55 to ditch the @entity57 with 155 passengers and crew in @entity61 's @entity60			2
no one was hurt , and the plane is now on display at the @entity64 , a 15 - minute drive from the @entity28			2
there 's a lot more to see at the museum , including two rare aircraft -- the @entity70 and a @entity71 -- so do n't blame us if you end up taking more than an hour			2
maybe you can steal a little more time -- a whole afternoon ? if so , here 's an idea that 's perfect for the politics crowd : former secretary of state @entity79 's prized collection of jeweled pins			2
see more than 200 of them at the @entity83 at 500 s. tryon st. , about a 15 - minute walk from @entity28			2
there 's a funny story linked to these sparkly artifacts			2
@entity79 started collecting pins during rising tensions between the @entity91 and @entity92 , she told the @entity93			1
in 1994 , when she was @entity91 ambassador to the @entity95 , the @entity92 press called her a " serpent			1
" @entity79 turned that insult into a fashion statement			0
at her next meeting about @entity92 , she sported a decorative golden brooch that looked like a snake			0
that 's how @entity79 started her signature style of wearing jewelry to send not - so - subtle diplomatic signals			1
another idea : take a 10 - minute drive from the convention hall and explore @entity109			1
this neighborhood 's name comes from its location on @entity113 , where long ago , textile mills hummed with activity			2
now the district buzzes with live music , trendy restaurants and funky coffeehouses			1
take a seat inside the friendly @entity121 near @entity123 and 36th streets			0
" we have no idea necessarily what to expect , " barista @entity124 says about possible convention traffic			2
the shop -- named after a " terrible , terrible song " sung by " friends " tv character @entity132 boasts a new bean roaster that @entity124 says sets it apart from the competition			0
@entity109 also has another rarity : a 24 - hour @entity138 bakery and cafe			1
the eclectic vibe at @entity141 's is almost as memorable as its savory soups , sandwiches , cookies , pastries and cakes			2
or take an hour and hit @entity147 , an independent music shop that specializes in vinyl , cds and dvds			2
it 's about a 10 - minute drive from the arena , off @entity155 in the trendy @entity157 neighborhood			1
got kids ? consider an afternoon at @entity159 , @entity160 or @entity161 , offering a hands - on educational experience for the whole family			0
if you can swing an entire day ? would you be interested in seeing any of the following up close ? @entity167 's purple guitar that he played at the 2007 @entity168			1
@entity171 's personal quran and diary in which he described his 1964 pilgrimage to @entity174			0
@entity176 ' tennis outfit that she wore when she won @entity177 in 2009			0
author @entity180 's @entity179 typewriter that he used to write " roots			0
" @entity183 's black flair pants , purple top and crop vest			0
astronaut @entity187 's space shuttle flight suit and helmet			0
they 're all in one place : the @entity191 for @entity192 , a 15 - minute walk from the arena			0
the museum 's " @entity197 " exhibit celebrates and documents five centuries of @entity199			1
also within walking distance from the arena is the @entity202 , where historic vehicles and impressive displays show off 60 years of stock car racing			0
about 15 miles from the convention hall is the world 's largest man - made whitewater river			1
the @entity210 offers more than 400 acres of outdoor action , including a zipline , kayaking , rafting , mountain biking and rock climbing			0
" it 's kind of a @entity220 one - stop shop " for outdoor activities , says spokesman @entity217			1
if you 're not into the action and just want to hang out for the day , the price is right : there 's no general admission fee			0
of course , plenty will be overnighting it experience a concert at @entity109 's @entity231 , a historic cinema converted into one of @entity7 's beloved music venues			1
the theater 's walls are decorated with beautiful , giant mural paintings			0
the convention week 's events offer a mix of music and art. check the theater 's website for details			1
finally , let 's not forget shopping			0
@entity247 , which boasts about 200 retail and outlet shops , is about a half - hour northeast of @entity7			1
another shopping mecca , @entity252 -- about six miles south of the city 's center -- offers high - end retailers such as @entity256 and @entity257			1
some of the region 's best furniture manufacturers and outlets can be found an hour northwest of the city in @entity262 , @entity8 , and an hour northeast in @entity263			1
one word of advice , call ahead if you can			0
many of these places are operating under special hours because of the convention			0
