-- the time was always going to come when society would need to face the pointy end of the voluntary euthanasia debate : those hard cases that would challenge most people 's support for the issue , the cases and circumstances which constitute never - before trodden ground			1
while in most western countries polls repeatedly show strong community support for a terminally ill person 's right to obtain medical assistance to die , the results would likely be quite different if the person involved was not an adult , was not of sound mind or was not , in the strictest sense , terminally ill. as @entity22 decides whether to extend the right to euthanasia to those who have @entity26 's and to children , the sharp end of the debate is staring us all in the face , regardless of where we live			1
the euthanasia argument is about to escalate to heights unknown : we will all be challenged about how to have a good debate , a rational debate as members of the human race , and in being challenged , we must guard against the moral panic that this issue will inevitably throw up			1
the issues on the table are too important for hysterical indignation and fundamental religious dogma			0
we are all grown - ups			0
the debate we are set to have -- some two decades after the world 's first right to die law was passed in @entity51 's @entity50 -- should be grown - up too , even if some of the stakeholders we are about to discuss are not			2
historically , children and people with @entity26 's are two segments of the community that have been viewed as having little or no agency , something that is referred to as ' capacity ' in legal terms			2
generally speaking , neither group has been held to be competent to make decisions that would be in their best interests			0
yet this is what the @entity22 are now planning			2
the opposite view : euthanasia - we can live without it ... for many in the ageing population , there are few fears which top that of getting dementia			2
anyone who has watched a loved family member sink into the abyss of confusion and disorientation will know the utter terror that can accompany the process , as the person in question tries to juxtapose moments of clarity with the awfulness of knowing one 's grip on reality -- and with it one 's dignity and sense of self -- is slipping			0
in @entity98 earlier this year , the @entity96 member of parliament @entity97 paved the way with her private members bill which , if passed , would allow @entity98 to include an assisted suicide in their @entity102			0
for those who may find themselves with @entity26 's in future , this inclusion would be a valuable pre-planning tool : " if i do get dementia , at least the children will know what i want			1
i can now rest assured that my wishes not to live " like that " will be respected			0
" within the membership of @entity116 , this is a common sentiment			0
so too is the wish not to waste government money keeping the demented elderly alive in the nation 's care homes if that is not how , when they could communicate , they said they wanted to spend their last days			0
on the topic of children , the debate is a little easier			2
some children do develop terminal illnesses and do die well before their time			0
it is not impossible for such young people to have a well - developed sense of their own mortality			0
while the @entity22 will likely structure legislative developments in this area with stringent safeguards , it is the practice of forcing terminally - ill children to battle on in spite of an appalling prognosis , trying to make it to 18 , that is driving the agenda			1
for both groups , the @entity22 are bravely tackling difficulties emerging in their existing legislation , current laws that are quite obviously inadequate , even cruel , in certain circumstances			1
unless modern medicine has a cure for @entity26 's and any number of the terminal illnesses that confront children , the current situation is that they will keep suffering			1
if suffering can not be relieved , the question then becomes : what should the @entity157 do ? should we all be forced to live on regardless of the quality of life that confronts us ? or , should legislation be extended to ensure dignity and choice for all ? at @entity116 our motto is " a peaceful death is everybody 's right			1
" somehow the tagline " a peaceful death is everybody 's right unless you are a child or a teenager or have dementia , in which case tough luck ! " does n't have the same appeal or the same logic			2
the @entity22 are to be applauded for their progressive thinking and acting -- in the cold light of day , the morality of their intentions is not that challenging when the alternatives are considered			0
as a son to my aged mother and as a grandfather to my son 's three boys , i welcome the type of society that the @entity22 are proposing			1
of course , i hope no one i love will ever need to use such laws			1
but i draw great comfort from knowing they are there all the same			0
the opposite view : euthanasia - we can live without it ... interactive : euthanasia and the right to die around the world the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity208 .			1

@entity22 *mps* may allow terminally ill children and those with dementia access to euthanasia
*pro-euthanasia* *advocate* dr. @entity208 says debate must avoid moral panic , dogma
@entity208 : if a *patient* 's suffering can not be relieved , what should the @entity157 do ?
" i hope no one i love will ever need to use such laws , but draw comfort from them "
