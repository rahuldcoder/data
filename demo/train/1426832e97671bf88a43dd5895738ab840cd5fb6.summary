-- mind your language or face arrest			1
that is the warning from @entity6 police to fans thinking of using the word " yid " at sunday 's potentially explosive @entity11 derby game between @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity15 's @entity14 recently said the word -- deemed anti-semitic but chanted by some @entity12 fans as a term of endearment -- had " no place in our game			1
" @entity12 , based in @entity6 , has a large contingent of @entity24 fans , with some even calling themselves the " @entity25			1
" " some words -- like the ' y ' word -- which historically have been perceived by some as acceptable , cause harassment , alarm or distress to others , and people who use this language could be committing a criminal offense , " the @entity26 said in a statement on its website			0
chief superintendent @entity38 , sunday 's match commander , added that the decision was n't taken lightly			2
" this topic has been debated at length but our position is clear , racism and offensive language have no place in football or indeed in society , " @entity38 said			0
" those supporters who engage in such behavior should be under no illusion that they may be committing an offense and may be liable to a warning or be arrested			0
" the @entity26 has a long history of working with football clubs and the football authorities , including the @entity14 , to educate , encourage and empower supporters to stamp out racism in football and to ensure that there is no misunderstanding about what constitutes racist language or behavior			0
" the authorities will be hoping the game does n't mirror last season 's fixture at @entity68 , when a section of away fans chanted , ' @entity69 is coming for you			2
' a @entity13 season - ticket holder was later banned for life for performing a @entity76 style salute			1
it prompted then @entity13 midfielder @entity78 , an @entity79 international , to call the behavior " embarrassing			0
" @entity12 sits third in the @entity11 , two points behind leader and @entity6 rival @entity83 , while goal - shy @entity13 is a point above the relegation zone .			0

fans using the word " yid " at sunday 's game between @entity12 and @entity13 face arrest
some fans *brand* themselves the " @entity25 , " though the term can be offensive
the @entity14 had warned fans they face *prosecution* for uttering " yid "
a @entity13 supporter was banned last season for his @entity76 salute at the same fixture
