-- @entity1 took a big step to escaping the @entity10 's so - called " group of death " by crushing @entity3 7 - 0 in a rematch of the two nations ' famous 1966 clash in @entity7 on monday			1
forty - four years ago , the communist country 's team shocked the soccer world by taking a 3 - 0 lead after only 24 minutes of their quarterfinal in @entity18 , but the @entity19 hit back to win 5 - 3 with four goals from star forward @entity21			1
there was to be no repeat in rain - drenched @entity24 , as @entity1 found form after the disappointing opening draw with the @entity27 and claimed second place in @entity29 ahead of friday 's final round of matches			1
@entity33 's team led just 1 - 0 at halftime thanks to a 29th - minute strike from @entity36 as the @entity37 again showed the fighting spirit that tested @entity39 in their opening 2 - 1 defeat			1
but the floodgates opened in the second spell as @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 scored in the space of eight minutes , then substitute @entity48 netted to clinch the biggest winning margin of the tournament so far			2
captain @entity51 and then @entity46 again compounded the @entity37 ' misery , giving the @entity53 a massive goal - difference advantage over the @entity55 ahead of their eagerly - anticipated showdown with leaders @entity39			1
the @entity59 have already qualified for the second round , with six points from two victories , while the @entity53 have four points and the @entity27 one			0

we need to be more ambitious and determined for the next phase , " @entity33 told @entity66			0
" we were very determined to win this game but the game we played today will not help us overcome @entity39			0
we do n't want @entity39 to score any goals because this will put our reputation , our prestige , into question			0
" @entity1 went close to opening the scoring in the seventh minute when defender @entity75 hit the post with a powerful header from a corner			0
@entity36 , who scored the winner in the second leg of @entity1 's qualifying playoff against @entity82 , broke the deadlock when he ran onto a fine threaded pass from midfielder @entity46 and slotted coolly past @entity85			2
eight minutes after halftime , winger @entity44 fired a shot through the goalkeeper 's legs after being set up by @entity36 and @entity45			0
striker @entity45 , recalled after missing the first match , then headed in @entity92 's left - wing cross on 56 minutes before @entity51 laid on the third goal for @entity46 on the hour mark			1
@entity51 , the world 's most expensive player , hit the crossbar in the 71st minute as he was denied his first goal of the tournament -- a similarly spectacular effort against the @entity27 also smashed into the woodwork			1
@entity48 made it 5 - 0 after the besieged @entity102 defense failed to cut a cross by fellow substitute @entity104 10 minutes later			2
@entity51 finally found the net with two minutes to play , showing his trademark cheeky skill as he pushed the ball past the keeper and then juggled the rebound on his back before slotting into the empty goal			2
@entity46 added his second just a minute later with a powerful header from a cross by another replacement , @entity117 .			0
