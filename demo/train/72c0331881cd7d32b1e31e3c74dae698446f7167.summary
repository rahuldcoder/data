@entity0 , @entity1 -- for the first week of @entity5 's child sex trial , eight young men held jurors spellbound with testimony about a sports hero they say groped them in the car , soaped them in the shower and sexually assaulted them on a basement waterbed			1
how do you come back from something like that ? @entity5 's defense attorneys , @entity17 and @entity18 , responded this week with rapid - fire rounds of testimony ; 29 witnesses took the stand in little more than two days -- including 11 character witnesses in a single hour			1
the defense also chipped away at the character and motives of the alleged victims , sparing no one : not the young accusers , not their families and certainly not the cops			1
the defense rested shortly before noon wednesday without calling @entity5 as a witness			1
the prosecution had no further rebuttal			2
the jurors were dismissed and told to return thursday morning for closing arguments			2
they also were advised to pack suitcases , because they will be sequestered at a hotel during deliberations			2
many defense witnesses -- including @entity41 , his wife of 46 years -- painted @entity5 in glowing terms befitting a saint			1
others questioned the motives of his accusers , particularly the ones known as @entity50 1 , 4 and 9			1
two mental health experts , one for the defense and one for the prosecution , seemed to cancel each other out			1
@entity5 's character witnesses included more than a dozen old friends , former colleagues , fellow church members , ex-players and boys and girls he counseled through his nonprofit for at - risk kids , the @entity64			1
they portrayed him as a football legend , role model and selfless do - gooder with a sterling reputation			1
for @entity5 , it was like homecoming weekend in the courtroom as he chatted , smiled and shook hands with people he has known for decades			1
they included @entity75 , an all - america linebacker at @entity76 who went on to play for the @entity77 and works now as a probation officer in @entity79			1
his testimony was typical : " we all looked up to him , " @entity75 testified in a booming voice			2
" he is a class act			2
" @entity5 , retired defensive coordinator for @entity76 's storied football team , is charged with 51 counts of molesting 10 boys over 15 years			1
he denies the charges , and his lawyers have suggested that overzealous police and prosecutors targeted him in a trumped - up case			1
they have compared him to @entity93 , fighting @entity94			2
all you need to know about allegations , how case unraveled the defense called psychologist @entity99 to testify about what no. 4 called " creepy love letters " he received from @entity5			1
@entity99 characterized the letters as symptomatic of a mental condition called histrionic personality disorder			2
he said he diagnosed @entity5 with the disorder after giving him two personality tests , interviewing him for six hours and reviewing the letters and other evidence			1
but a prosecution psychiatrist , dr. @entity109 , saw no evidence of any personality disorder in the test results			2
if anything , he added , there might be some indication of a " psychosexual disorder			2
" but he said further information would be needed for a diagnosis			2
defense attorneys played what they say is a smoking gun audiotape : 16 minutes of inadvertently recorded conversation in which a state trooper , cpl. @entity124 , casually discusses with attorney @entity125 how best to get the cooperation of the young man who would become known as @entity128			1
@entity124 had denied advising no. 4 about what other victims were saying ; the tape contradicted his testimony			1
the witness was so terrified to talk with police that he curled in the fetal position on his sofa the first time officers knocked on his door , according to testimony			2
he hired @entity125 , who specializes in representing crime victims and advertises extensively			0
no. 4 was taking a cigarette break outside when @entity125 suggested to the trooper that it might help to let him know others were talking			0
the tape was left rolling inadvertently , and it captured everything			1
" oh , you 're kidding , the time frame matches up ? " @entity125 can be heard saying			0
" can we at some point say , ' listen , we have interviewed other kids			0
... other kids have admitted there was intercourse			0
is there anything else you want to tell us ? ' " @entity124 responded that such a tactic was not unusual			0
" yes , we do that with all the other kids , " he said on the tape			1
" this is what we found ; this is how he operates			0
... this has happened , and that has happened			0
" no. 4 returned to the room and was given a @entity171			0
the popping and fizzing of soda cans being opened can be heard as @entity124 addresses his reluctant witness : " you 're not the first , " the trooper said			0
" i 've interviewed probably nine kids , nine other adults			0
... if this was a book , you 'd be repeating word for word what other people told us			0
and we know from these other young adults who talked to us that there is a pretty well - defined progression that he operated and still operates to some degree			1
" the defense contends that no. 4 's statement was " tainted " by suggestions about what the accuser should say			1
" you mentioned rape , oral sex and other activities you got from other accusers , right ? " attorney @entity18 asked the trooper when he took the witness stand			1
" yes , " @entity124 responded			0
almost as a bonus for the defense , @entity124 and another former trooper contradicted each other on what they had discussed during a court break minutes earlier			1
@entity124 acknowledged that they talked about his testimony ; the other trooper denied it			0
only one of them can be right			0
opinion : secrecy and the @entity5 trial the defense attack on no. 4 continued with the testimony of a childhood friend who said he had a reputation for being " a dishonest person who embellished stories			1
" there was no love lost with @entity227 , either			0
asked about no. 4 , she said , " he had his problems			0
he was very demanding , and he was very conniving , and he wanted his own way			0
he did n't listen a lot			0
" she found the boy known as no. 1 to be " very clingy to @entity5 " and said he once ran across the room and jumped in her husband 's lap. another time , at a wrestling meet , he hugged her husband			1
" he would never look anybody in they eye , " she added			0
the defense also chipped away at the credibility and motives of no. 1 and his family by calling his mother and a former neighbor to the stand			2
the mother denied saying the case would make her wealthy , but the neighbor , @entity255 , testified that after her son claimed he had been sexually abused by @entity5 , she said , " i 'll own his house			1
" he added , " she said , ' when this settles out , she 'll have a nice big house in the country , with a fence , and the dogs can run free			0
' " as for her son , @entity264 quoted him as saying , " when this is over , i 'll have a nice new jeep			0
" @entity227 had little to say about the other accusers , except for no. 9 , whom she recalled as " a charmer , " adding , " he knew what to say and when to say it			2
" she said she never witnessed any inappropriate contact between her husband and boys from the @entity64			0
she said some slept in an upstairs bedroom at their home during sleepovers , some slept in a first - floor room , and others slept in the basement			2
she said she never went down there but added that her husband would go to the basement to say good night to his guests			0
although the basement was not soundproof , she said , she never heard a thing			0
" i just know he went and told them good night			0
" asked by prosecutor @entity290 what would motivate eight young men to make up lies about her husband , she responded , " i ... i ... i do n't know			0

defense *strategy* in @entity5 case was to tear down accusers , families , cops
character witnesses portrayed former @entity76 coach as role model , do - gooder
defense calls 16 - minute tape between accuser 's attorney and *investigator* a smoking gun
