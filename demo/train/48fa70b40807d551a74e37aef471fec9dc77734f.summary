@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 city has a dog problem			1
thousands of stray canines wander the streets and suburbs of @entity0			0
they can be seen loping through the recently completed parks and housing developments that have sprung up around what was once a sleepy @entity14 resort			0
in the countdown to the @entity17 , @entity1 animal rights activists have accused city authorities of ramping up a campaign to exterminate street dogs through the use of poison			1
@entity23 says she witnessed the long , agonizing death of a street dog when she walked out of a movie theater in @entity0 two weeks ago			2
" at first i thought someone beat the dog , " she recalled			0
" the dog jumped up and started running around in circles			0
then she fell down and started spitting up ... i called the veterinarian			0
he said there is a 100 % guarantee the dog was poisoned			0
" @entity23 filmed the dying dog with her cell phone			0
so did @entity38 , another @entity0 resident			0
@entity38 said she encountered a dog convulsing and barking in fear and pain in @entity0 's @entity44 neighborhood in december			0
" they always poison the street dogs here , " @entity23 said			1
" but in december it got terrible ... they began poisoning the animals terribly before the @entity4			1
" reports of the widespread culling of animals have put city and @entity4 officials on the defensive			1
" all stray dogs that are found on the @entity59 are collected by a professional veterinary contractor for the well - being of the people on the @entity59 and the animals themselves , " the @entity56 said in a statement this week			1
" all healthy animals are released following their health check			2
" @entity67 , the head of the administration for @entity0 's @entity70 district , said volunteers were welcome to take stray dogs to a brand new shelter recently opened on the outskirts of the city			1
but the announcement of new government - backed shelter was met with deep distrust by members of the grassroots network of animal rights activists in @entity0			1
" over the last couple of days , when this uproar began , they built this new shelter just for the media , " said @entity83 , a dentist who built her own make - shift shelter to protect dogs from extermination			1
animal rights activists in @entity0 sent @entity2 photos of three recent contracts signed between the @entity0 city government and @entity95 , a company headquartered in @entity96			1
in one of the documents , dated may 24 , 2013 , the city government agreed to pay the company 99,450 rubles [ roughly $ 2,800 ] for the " trapping and gathering of neglected animals			1
" @entity2 made several attempts to speak by phone with executives at @entity95			0
company representatives declined to respond to allegations their employees poisoned street animals			1
as alarm grows among @entity1 dog lovers , some animal rights activists have taken matters into their own hands			1
last month , one @entity114 , @entity115 , drove all the way to @entity0 to pick up a van - load of street dogs that he then " evacuated " to the @entity1 capital			1
video of the journey trip was posted on a @entity124 page titled " @entity125 in @entity0			0
" meanwhile , @entity83 and several friends continue to donate time and money to feed , house and sterilize the dozen street dogs they placed in a small kennel they built on the outskirts of @entity0			1
this week , the dogs barked and wagged their tails madly when @entity83 and several other volunteers arrived with fresh supplies of dog food			2
" we are protecting them from @entity142 , " said @entity83 said			0
" i do n't blame the @entity4 , " said @entity143 , as she scrubbed out the kennels with a mop			2
" we do n't have a sterilization program , so there is a huge amount of stray dogs here and authorities try to control them			2
" @entity143 , a lawyer living in @entity0 , argued @entity1 needs new legislation for the protection and management of animals			1
" in @entity1 , you can abuse animals and it 's not a crime			1
you can buy and adopt an animal and release it on the street , it 's not a crime , " she said			2
" you have no legal obligation to sterilize your dog or cat			0
" @entity143 and @entity83 both conceded that their families often accused them of being " crazy " about animals			2
but one of their fellow volunteers had another explanation for why she devoted so much time to caring and feeding for homeless animals			2
" at my age i prefer taking care of animals , " said @entity181 , who described herself as a " simple @entity183 nurse " who worked at a hospital in @entity0			2
a fluffy street dog named " @entity190 " followed @entity181 constantly around the kennel , and periodically leaped into her arms			0
" people have hands , legs , brains			0
but animals have been abandoned			0
we need to save them , " the nurse said			0
