-- anything can still happen at the quake - stricken @entity3 nuclear power plant at @entity5 , but experts are hopeful that the situation will stabilize			1
in the best - case scenario , electrical power and cooling would be restored to all of the six units of the plant , said @entity13 , spokesman for the @entity14 , a policy organization of the nuclear energy and technologies industry in @entity17			1
restoring electric power is essential to stabilizing the plant , said @entity20 , professor of nuclear science and engineering at the @entity23			1
power would ensure that the water can be provided to cover the fuel			2
workers hope to install a crucial panel at an annex building , which was not severely affected by last friday 's post-earthquake tsunami , for a new power supply system that should be finished friday morning , an official from the @entity28 said friday morning			1
the improvised power system , using 1.5 kilometers total of cable , is expected to provide electricity to power the cooling systems for the @entity38 1 and 2 reactors at the plant			1
also , engineers got an emergency diesel generator for @entity45 running , and it is supplying power to units 5 and 6 , @entity5 's @entity41 said friday			1
water injection to the spent fuel pool was continuing			0
" obviously what we 're hoping for is that they will bring the various cooling problems under control in the very near future , " said @entity49 , professor of nuclear science and engineering at @entity23			0
once the fuel rods are submerged in water , the large releases of radioactive materials should come to an end , @entity49 said			0
when the cooling water is restored to the spent fuel pools , and the reactor is cooling and the flooding can be maintained , expectations are for a stabilization of the situation , and a major reduction of radiation emissions , he said			0
" that 's when we 'll be able to say , ' we 've got this under control , ' " @entity49 said			2
once it 's been under control for a week or two , things may stabilize			2
the whole cleanup would take a matter of months or even years , @entity49 said			0
and the site wo n't be usable again , said @entity82 was , professor in the department of materials science and engineering at the @entity86			0
even in the best case scenario , there will be melted fuel in the reactor that 's not going to be usable , was said			2
a real concern is the after - heat arising in the fuel rods , which need to have water cooling them , @entity49 said			0
unless there are much bigger releases and contaminations near the site , people may one day be able to safely get closer to @entity3 than the current established evacuation zones , @entity20 said			1
the @entity103 government has instructed @entity103 to stay 50 miles from the plant ; for @entity5 citizens , the evacuation zone is only about 12 miles			2
" the fact that you have differing policies does n't mean the @entity103 thinks it 's more dangerous , " @entity20 said			0
it 's simply because the @entity103 is not in a position to help its citizens in @entity5 , he said			0
the situation at @entity3 is worse than @entity114 , the @entity115 plant that suffered a partial core meltdown in one of its reactors in 1979 , @entity20 said			1
that 's because at @entity3 there 's more radioactive material involved , and it 's less contained he said			1
at the @entity128 , the world 's worst nuclear power plant accident , which occurred in 1986 , the facility had to be sealed off with a large concrete sarcophagus			1
it 's hard to say whether this will need to happen at @entity3 , experts say			1
it all depends on the extent of the contamination , which is unknown , was said			0
sealing off @entity114 was also discussed at the time of that disaster , @entity13 said , but instead the reactor was cleaned out , with the damaged fuel and core debris shipped off - site and put into storage			0
" we 're still in the wait - and - see mode , " @entity13 said .			0

experts : restoring electric power is essential to stabilizing @entity3
work is *ongoing* to establish a new power supply system , says @entity150
it 's unknown whether the plant will need to be sealed off , as @entity128 was
