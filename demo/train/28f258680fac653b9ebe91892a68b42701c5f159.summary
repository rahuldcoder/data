some lawmakers in @entity1 want to make @entity4 history			1
what 's their beef ? the course , which was redesigned by the @entity8 and implemented in high school classrooms last year , is n't quite pro-america enough			0
" in essence , we have a new emphasis on what is bad about @entity16 , " said state representative @entity10 , the measure 's chief sponsor			1
" ( the new framework ) trades an emphasis on @entity16 's founding principles of constitutional government in favor of robust analyses of gender and racial oppression and class ethnicity and the lives of marginalized people , where the emphasis on instruction is of @entity16 as a nation of oppressors and exploiters , " @entity10 lamented at a legislative committee hearing tuesday			1
not only does @entity36 1380 -- which sailed through a committee hearing this week -- bar state funds from being used on @entity39 , the legislation specifies what should be taught in the classroom by specifically identifying dozens of " documents , writings , speeches , proclamations and recordings related to the history , heritage and foundation of the @entity50 " in the 10 - page bill			0
what did @entity10 single out ? old standards such as @entity54 , @entity56 's @entity55 and " @entity57 " by @entity58			0
the bill does n't totally avoid what @entity10 called @entity16 's " blemishes " : he included @entity63 's " @entity62 " essay and " @entity66 " speech , as well as the " @entity71 " speech made by @entity68 as part of the replacement curriculum			2
@entity10 , a @entity72 , also singled out three speeches made by @entity74 and one by @entity75 as important enough to @entity50 history to be added to the new curriculum , but none from from @entity79 , @entity80 , or @entity81 -- the last three @entity83 presidents .			0

@entity80 would *ban* @entity39 in @entity1 , replace it with new curriculum
