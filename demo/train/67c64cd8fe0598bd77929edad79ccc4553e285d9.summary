@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's always tricky being a tourist alongside foreigners in your homeland			1
that may be especially true in @entity1 , a country so vastly different in every respect from the @entity9			1
but when the call came from my husband 's niece and nephew , @entity15 and @entity16 , to accompany them and their father , @entity18 , on a trip to the @entity21 region of @entity22 , i could n't say no. part of it was purely selfish			1
i 'd never been to @entity22 , a region off @entity1 's northern @entity26 state that borders @entity27			1
it 's fairly accessible these days by plane -- at least in the summer -- but during my childhood in @entity1 , @entity22 was not a destination			1
back then , most @entity1 visited picturesque @entity32 , the summer capital of @entity26 and @entity33			1
that was long before a violent insurgency , aimed at wresting part of @entity33 from @entity1 control , ravaged the area			1
i 'd heard from friends who 'd been to @entity22 in recent years about how glorious a place it was , surrounded by towering , snow - capped peaks and @entity44 monasteries			2
i 'd yearned to go for a very long time , so the invitation was instantly appealing			2
but there was a deeper reason			2
@entity18 is a pediatric dentist in @entity48 , @entity49			1
he told me that when he was young , his father , also a dentist , had taken him on a goodwill mission to @entity52			1
it was a trip that became indelibly etched in his mind			1
what @entity9 kid would n't learn from helping others so much less fortunate ? @entity18 told me he wanted his own children to experience something similar			2
he 'd been thinking about it for a long time and then suddenly , just like that , @entity15 was entering her senior year in high school			2
this was @entity18 's last window of opportunity			1
he signed on with a group called @entity69 , a @entity70 - based charitable organization that provides dental care for poor kids in @entity1 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
he was going as one of six volunteer dentists			2
but the group needed nondental volunteers as well			2
@entity15 and @entity16 were going -- it was their first trip to @entity1 -- and they inspired me to sign up as a nondental assistant			1
if they could do it , why not me ? i was n't so sure about how much help i 'd be			0
i could n't tell you what " scaler " or " explorer " tools looked like , but it would n't hurt , i thought , to learn new skills			0
i rescheduled my previously planned trip to @entity1			1
i almost always visit home in the winter when the humidity and sizzling temperatures subside in @entity100 and in my hometown , @entity102			0
but there is no easy way to reach @entity0 , the @entity22 capital , in the winter			1
so on a late august evening , i boarded a flight in @entity109 bound for @entity100			0
after a day getting over jet lag and visiting family , i joined the @entity69 group and was immediately relieved to know that few of the nondental volunteers had any experience with cavities or extractions			1
but we all had two things in common : we wanted to do something good , and we wanted to see one of the most breathtaking places in the world			0
less than an hour after the @entity126 jet left smoggy @entity100 behind , passengers strained to see out the windows			0
the view was nothing short of magnificent			0
the rising sun kissed the tall , stark peaks of the @entity21			1
some of them looked like they were on fire , the orange hues so startlingly bright			0
after we settled into the @entity138 , we ventured out into town -- even though it had been strongly suggested that we take it easy in our rooms			0
@entity0 is about 12,000 feet above sea level and many a visitor has fallen prey to altitude sickness			1
we filled up on @entity147 momos ( dumplings filled with lamb , chicken or vegetables ) and got up early the next morning to begin setting up the dental clinic			1
@entity153 , the owner of the guesthouse , helps set up the clinic every year			1
he 's a businessman and a former dean at a school who wants to do something for the kids in @entity22 , many of whom hail from impoverished homes and lack the services they need			1
" dental care , " @entity153 told me , " is not so good here			1
" the kids do n't get check - ups			2
many do n't even have toothbrushes or paste at home			0
the only care , @entity153 said , is for emergencies -- bad infections and painful teeth extractions			0
downstairs from our makeshift clinic is a permanent center that @entity180 set up for kids with special needs			1
there 's a room painted with stars where children with autism can relax			2
there 's also a physiotherapy center for children who 've had corrective surgery so they can walk again			2
a wheelchair can be a curse in a place like @entity0			1
it 's hilly and hardly anywhere is handicapped accessible			2
@entity153 said the biggest problem here is lack of water and hygiene			0
most children grow up with a mouthful of rotting teeth , which can lead to other problems later in life			0
and that 's what we begin to see the next day when the long lines begin to form at our humble dental clinic			1
one day , we encountered about 250 students from @entity214 who traveled for hours from mountain villages			0
" they are kids who only go to see a dentist when they are in a lot of pain , " said their teacher @entity216 , 38			1
that includes @entity223 , 14			0
she 's already had to have two fillings ; now she 's in for a third			2
she cowered from @entity18 's anesthesia needle			2
her friend @entity226 tried to calm her down			0
i wiped the tears flowing down her cheeks			0
but within an hour , she was out the door , her cavity filled			0
over six days , the @entity69 volunteers saw 715 patients -- fillings , extractions , cleanings , sealants			0
in all , the group estimated the value of the service at about $ 170,000			0
but we felt like a million			0
the clinic , i think , was especially meaningful for the @entity1 among the volunteers -- there were three @entity1 dentists and one other @entity1 dental assistant			1
i 'd covered international aid organizations in my homeland -- in conflict and the aftermath of natural disaster -- but i 'd never been a participant in anything like this			2
my crash course in dentistry probably wo n't take me very far though the next time i am sitting in a chair ( take note , dr. @entity261 ) , i will know what you mean when you say : " 18 occlusal			0
" i will also know when you pick up the dread extraction tool			0
eventually , the names of the children i met will fade in my mind			0
what i will remember are the expressions of awe and astonishment on the faces of @entity15 and @entity16 , who , as teenagers , discovered a slice of a strange new land			0
they , like their father , @entity18 , who never forgot his trip to @entity52 , will hopefully look back on @entity1 in 2013 as a necessary stepping stone in the path of life			1
what i will also remember are certain moments -- @entity289 's hand clutching mine so tightly that i thought the bones in my fingers might break			2
she was 11 , suffered from anxiety and deathly afraid of @entity18 's needle			2
when her ordeal was over and she finally was able to smile again , i handed her a toothbrush to take home			0
she ran out , down the stairs and out into the afternoon light			0
two minutes later , she returned with an older student who spoke a smattering of @entity302			0
" thank you , " the older girl told me			0
" she would not have been able to bear this without you			0
" i watched @entity307 return to her schoolmates playing on a swing set in the shadows of a 17th century @entity147 - style palace			0
every visitor to @entity0 makes the trek up to that palace			1
from up there , tourists gasp at the scenery before them , the majesty of the @entity21 ahead and all of the city below			1
but most tourists will never see what i did in @entity0			1
i saw a part of my homeland through a new lens			1
for that , i am grateful			0

family members asked @entity2 's @entity326 to accompany them on a trip to her native @entity1
she volunteered to work at a dental clinic for poor kids in the @entity21 city of @entity0
she went with her husband 's niece and nephew and their father , a pediatric dentist
@entity344 saw her homeland through an entirely new lens
