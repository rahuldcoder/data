editor 's note : this is another in a series of @entity5 commentaries debunking common tech myths			0
( @entity5 ) -- @entity7 loves to talk about how " open " it is			1
but the reality is that it 's actually not always open ; only when it 's convenient to @entity7			2
and , anyway , " open " is n't necessarily better			0
for example , @entity7 especially loves to boast that its @entity13 software for phones and tablets is " open			1
" you 'd think that means that anyone would have control over their phones , to install all the apps they want , change the way it looks , and update to the latest version of @entity13			2
but that 's not what it means			0
it really means that @entity7 's close partners -- mobile operators and phone manufacturers , but not consumers -- can chop up @entity13 to their liking			1
that 's why many new @entity13 phones ship with pre-installed " crapware " apps			1
it 's why some have shortcomings , like the inability to install apps that are n't from @entity7 's official app market			2
and it 's why most @entity13 owners have to wait a long time for @entity13 software updates -- if the updates are ever made available for their specific phones			2
meanwhile , despite all the talk about @entity13 being " open , " there are even some things that @entity7 's huge @entity13 partners ca n't change			1
for example , when @entity56 wanted to swap out @entity7 's built - in location services on its @entity13 phones for a competing service from a startup called @entity61 , @entity7 effectively forced them to stop , according to a lawsuit that @entity61 filed against @entity7			1
what 's " open " about allegedly forcing your partners to use @entity7 's tools and guidelines instead of competing tools ? @entity13 is just one example			1
@entity7 has recently been inconsistent about its definition of " open " when it comes to web video technology , too			1
and if @entity7 were really serious about being " open , " they 'd share their search and advertising algorithms with the world			2
now that would be " open			0
" but of course @entity7 would never do that -- that 's proprietary information that ca n't fall into the hands of competitors			0
@entity7 has every incentive to keep its core business information " closed , " and it will likely continue to			0
the more we look , the more we see that " open " @entity7 is really more like " open when convenient or favorable to @entity7			1
" this is perfectly fine : @entity7 is a for - profit company and can do whatever it wants			0
but anyone who thinks its actions are transparent or truly " open " is pretending			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity92			0
