-- @entity2 's highest court has upheld a conviction and a $ 40 million judgment against a newspaper in a case that pitted the paper 's directors and a former opinion editor against the country 's president			1
the three - judge panel ruled late wednesday that a lower court 's decision to hold the paper accountable for the content of an opinion column that described president @entity18 as a dictator was correct			1
@entity18 sued @entity21 newspaper , arguing the article unjustly claimed he had ordered security forces to open fire at a hospital full of civilians last september			0
the newspaper and press freedom advocates countered that the president was trying to crack down on critics by restricting the media			2
" the truth has shined , " @entity18 said after the ruling			0
" we have set a precedent			0
this sentence and this process are historic			0
they demonstrate that nobody has the right to tarnish the truth , " the president said			0
" not only is the person who wrote it responsible , but also the directors who allowed the offense and the newspaper where it was printed			2
" the ruling means that the accused must pay $ 30 million , and the newspaper must pay $ 10 million , to @entity18			1
@entity50 , @entity21 's former opinion editor and author of the column , told @entity0 en @entity53 that the court ruling sets the wrong example			1
" of course this sets a precedent : for the first time in the history of @entity62 , and i suppose , the world , a president wins $ 40 million for his pocket by manipulating justice , naming the judges he desired , and using his influence , " @entity50 said			1
@entity50 and the newspaper 's directors argued that they were denied the opportunity to properly present their defense during the first trial , and accused @entity18 of influencing the selection of judges favorable to him on the high court			1
" the only thing that was left under these conditions was for the ratification of this shameful conviction , " @entity50 said			0
the court ruling also calls for three years in prison for @entity50			0
he resigned from the paper in july and is now living in @entity84 , where he is seeking asylum			0
the @entity87 - based @entity86 , which concluded in a special report that @entity2 's defamation laws have been systematically used to punish critical journalists , criticized the high court 's decision			1
" an editor is seeking political asylum , three executives may soon go to jail , and the country 's leading paper may go bankrupt solely because president @entity18 disliked an opinion piece , " said @entity93 , senior @entity94 coordinator for the organization			2
" this shortsighted ruling will only keep @entity106 journalists from investigating powerful politicians ; it represents a serious setback for democracy in @entity2			2
