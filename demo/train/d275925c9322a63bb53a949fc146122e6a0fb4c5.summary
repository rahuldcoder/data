-- let me tell you about the amazing kid who lives in our house			1
she 's 6 and she is the most hysterical , sarcastic , intelligent , funny , sweet , @entity8 , confident , strong , independent , considerate person i have ever met			1
i have no idea how she got to be this way			2
you see , my husband is a quadriplegic			1
i care for him , i work full - time , and there are days when i feel like our daughter gets very little of my attention			1
@entity19 was 6 months old when her dad was injured			1
during her first six months , he was just ok at changing diapers and he had no fashion sense when it came to dressing her			1
but he loved feeding her and playing with her and those two spent tons of time together			2
then , our lives changed			2
it was december 21 , 2007 , three days before @entity19 's first @entity29			1
at our annual @entity29 with our friends , around midnight , my husband decided to jump into the snow to make a snow angel			1
why ? because he 's @entity34			2
i remember looking at him , smiling and shaking my head			2
he looked at me , grinned and ran out into the snow -- and never got up			2
he had broken his neck at the @entity41 / @entity40 level and was paralyzed completely from the shoulders down			1
i do not remember my daughter 's first @entity29			1
my parents and sisters spent it with her while i was in the hospital with my husband			1
i went from hugging and snuggling her before the accident to barely being able to look at her without crying			2
i could n't even hold her because the responsibility of being a " single parent " in the physical sense was so overwhelming , i shut down			2
every single minute of the day , i begged someone to fix my husband			1
i remember one night in the @entity57 , the nurses got a rocker for me from the @entity59 and made me sit with @entity19 in @entity34 's room			1
it was like they knew we needed time together , just the two of us			2
it felt very foreign to me for a very long time			2
i felt like her babysitter , not her mom			2
while i rocked her , i stared at her wondering how we were going to manage as a family and how unfair it was to her that we were putting her through so much			1
my mom became @entity19 's surrogate parent for almost eight months because i needed to focus on my husband			1
she was the one who got up with our daughter when she cried , and brought her to visit in rehab			1
looking back , it still hurts to know how much time i missed with my daughter			1
i missed her first steps			2
i missed her first words			2
and it took years until i could let that all go , until i felt like her mom again			2
i 'm finally realizing how hard it must have been on my husband			1
he was no longer able to hold her			2
he had to watch from the sidelines while everyone else took care of his child			2
as new parents , you expect things to be difficult			0
but when dealing with a spinal cord injury , difficult does n't begin to describe it			0
i went from caring for a 6 - month - old with my husband to caring for a 6 - month - old and my husband			1
i liked how things were before the injury			0
my strong , confident husband took charge and i followed			1
in a second , it changed			0
i had to be responsible for our family			1
i am always the first one up and the last one to bed			0
i am pushed to the limit physically , emotionally and mentally almost every single day			0
but it has made us stronger			0
as we learned how to live our " new " life , things became easier			0
we found our sense of humor again			0
we worried about the relationship between @entity34 and @entity19			1
every time she said that she did n't like him or want him around , we worried that it was because of his injury			0
we made a big deal out of it			0
we talked to her teachers about it			0
we talked to a counselor about it			0
we thought that our daughter would n't connect with her dad because of his injury			1
it turns out we were wrong			0
@entity19 is your typical 6 - year - old who just happens to have learned more about life than most ever do , one who will place her hands on my face and solemnly tell me , " everything will be ok			1
" our daughter loves her daddy			1
she knows he 's disabled			0
she knows he broke his neck			1
she knows there are limitations to what they can do together but trust me , they push the boundaries every single day			0
more than once , she 's come running to tell me that daddy got stuck in the mud or fell forward in his wheelchair or ran out of battery while on a walk			0
she 's come to me crying because she bumped her head or arm falling from her daddy 's chair when she was climbing on it , or riding in his lap , or jumping onto the couch from his chair			0
too many times i 've had to yell at both of them for chasing each other through the house ; he in his chair and she on her scooter			0
too many times i 've had to tell them to stop it because they were about to get into trouble together			0
she 's figured out the best way to crawl into his lap to watch a movie			0
she climbs onto the counter so she can give him a kiss at night			0
she turns off his chair when he 's in her room at night so he has to stay while she falls asleep			0
she puts clips in his hair and puts makeup on him to play dress up			0
she rolls her eyes when @entity34 tells a terrible joke and thinks it 's hilarious when she tries to tickle him , even though he can not feel it			0
@entity19 does n't see @entity34 as a quadriplegic			1
she sees him as her father			0
she goes to him when she 's sad			0
she celebrates with him when she 's happy			0
his injury does not define their relationship			0
their love for each other does			0
every day i get to see that love they share grow into something even bigger			1
she has taught me how to look past her dad 's disability to see him for who he really is : my husband			1
that little kid has taught me more about love and life in her six years than anyone ever could			1
she taught us how to laugh again			1
how to have fun again			0
how to love each other again			0
she was the one who taught us that life was worth living			1
i can not wait to see else what else she can teach us as she grows .			0
