@entity0 -- business and labor negotiators working to hammer out a deal on an immigrant guest worker program have reached broad agreement , a source familiar with the talks said saturday , eliminating one major hurdle to legislation revamping the nation 's immigration system			1
business leaders and labor groups had been working to develop a plan on guest workers , tackling major sticking points on how much workers would be paid and the number of workers that would be allowed into the country each year			1
labor unions influencing the talks , including the @entity24 , argued for higher pay and fewer workers per year , since they are concerned about the effect guest workers would have on @entity29 workers			1
groups such as the @entity31 have pushed for guest workers to be paid the same as @entity29 workers , depending on their training and experience			1
the source said the agreement would allow for the creation of a new " @entity42 " visa for lesser - skilled workers not working in agriculture			2
those workers would be allowed to enter based on labor market shortages , and would be permitted to come into the @entity29 with the intention of applying for permanent residency			1
according to the source , the " @entity42 " visa would affect housekeepers , landscapers , retail workers and some construction workers			2
the agreement does not address visas for high - skilled workers ; visas to bring in family members ; or visas for agriculture workers			0
according to the @entity24 's understanding of the agreement , the " @entity42 " visa program would begin april 1 , 2015			2
the number of visas issued would never go below 20,000 per year and would be capped at 200,000 annually during times of high employment			0
one third of the visas would be reserved for businesses that employ fewer than 25 people , while no more than 15,000 visas per year would go to construction workers , the @entity24 said			0
the labor union indicated that in its understanding , the new program would not adversely affect the wages of @entity29 citizens , and that companies taking advantage of the " @entity42 " visas would be required to also recruit @entity29 workers			1
guest workers would be paid a wage similar to @entity29 workers with the same level of experience , according to the @entity24 's understanding			2
a new government department , the @entity87 and @entity88 , would determine specific industries with labor shortages and make recommendations to @entity92			0
the agency would also play a role in setting an annual cap for " @entity42 " visas			0
the @entity24 said the bureau would fall under the existing @entity98 , and its director would be appointed by the president and confirmed by @entity92			0
sen. @entity101 , @entity103 - @entity102 , one of eight senators who signed onto an immigration reform framework earlier this year , spoke with @entity106 , president and ceo of the @entity31 , about the new agreement , according to another source familiar with their conversation			1
the @entity31 wrote in a statement saturday that " the senators will make the decisions about any final agreements and what makes the best public policy overall			0
" earlier this week , a source familiar with the congressional negotiations told @entity1 that the eight senators have tentatively reached agreement on some of the other thorny issues surrounding comprehensive immigration reform , such as a path to citizenship and metrics for securing the border			1
sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak on the record			0
president @entity131 has made immigration reform a top priority of his second term in office , and a @entity136 official said saturday the president " continues to be encouraged by progress being made by the bipartisan group of senators			1
" " we look forward to seeing language once it is introduced , and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible , " the official said			0
@entity1 's @entity144 contributed to this report .			0
