-- @entity1 says it has severed its relationship with singer @entity3 " we have decided to part ways with @entity3 we appreciate his contributions over the past years , " the network said in a statement released thursday			1
the success of ' @entity9 ' has always been about the games and that will continue			1
" @entity3 , the 62 - year - old son of the legendary country singer @entity3 and a widely popular entertainer himself , compared president @entity15 to @entity16 , a remark that prompted controversy and resulted in " @entity9 " pulling his popular musical introduction from this week 's game			1
the song " @entity22 " had been the " @entity9 " theme on both @entity24 and @entity1 since 1991			1
@entity3 issued a statement giving a very different version : " after reading hundreds of e-mails , i have made my decision			1
by pulling my opening oct 3rd , you ( @entity1 ) stepped on the @entity31 , so therefore me , my song , and @entity33			1
it 's been a great run			0
" in an appearance on @entity38 ' " @entity37 " on monday morning , @entity3 referred to a june golf game in which @entity15 and @entity41 speaker @entity40 were on the same team , against vice president @entity43 and @entity45 gov. @entity44 , as " one of the biggest political mistakes ever			1
" asked what he did n't like about it , @entity3 said , " come on , come on			1
that 'd be like @entity16 playing golf with ( @entity54 prime minister @entity53 ) @entity52			1
" when one of the @entity38 interviewers later pointed out that @entity3 invoked " one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe ... the president , " @entity3 responded : " that is true , but i 'm telling you like it is , you know			1
that just was n't a good thing			0
it just did n't fly			0
so anyway , like @entity68 said , you do n't want to ask me a question because i 'm going to give you too straight of an answer			0
so talk about something else			0
" the singer apologized on tuesday , saying , " my analogy was extreme -- but it was to make a point			0
" i have always been very passionate about politics and sports and this time it got the best or worst of me			0
" the thought of the leaders of both parties jukin ' and high fiven ' on a golf course , while so many families are struggling to get by , simply made me boil over and make a dumb statement , and i am very sorry if it offended anyone			0
i would like to thank all my supporters			0
this was not written by some publicist , " @entity3 wrote			2
the @entity91 condemned @entity3 ' comments on tuesday and praised @entity1 for pulling his " @entity94 ? " musical recording that has opened " @entity9 " for years			1
" the @entity98 was a singular event in human history , and it is an insult to the memory of the millions who died as a result of @entity16 's plan of mass extermination to compare the @entity106 dictator to any @entity108 president , " said @entity95 , the league 's national director and a @entity98 survivor			2
" @entity3 should know better			2
he owes an apology to @entity98 survivors , their families , and the brave @entity108 soldiers who gave of themselves to fight the @entity106 menace during @entity115 the last thing we need is to enter another election cycle on a sour note tainted with inappropriate , tired and over-the - top analogies to the @entity121 , " he said			0
@entity3 has criticized @entity15 in the past , when the @entity122 was running for the presidency			1
in 2008 , @entity3 was even mentioned in some media outlets as saying he was considering running for the @entity125 as a @entity126 in the next election cycle , but those plans never materialized			2
@entity3 , who supported the @entity126 ticket in 2008 and even penned a song called " @entity131 , " said during that campaign that candidate @entity15 did n't like the national anthem			1
the " @entity131 " song , which is a riff on the @entity3 tune " @entity136 , " included a line suggesting that @entity15 has " terrorist friends			1
@entity3 was born may 26 , 1949 , and his iconic father nicknamed him " @entity3 " after a ventriloquist dummy used by @entity142 , a country comedian , @entity3 ' website says			2
he debuted on the @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity145 , at age 11			0
in addition to " @entity22 , " his other hits include " @entity149 , " " @entity150 , " " @entity151 , " " born to @entity152 , " and " @entity153			2
" the bearded @entity3 , who wears a hat and sunglasses during performances , suffered facial and head injuries in a 1975 mountain climbing accident			2
" those familiar with @entity3 's legend know it has n't been an easy road			2
every life and career has its peaks and valleys , but @entity3 has had more than his share			0
when he sings " @entity153 , " there 's an authority in his voice , because he 's done just that			0
he literally fell from a mountain top , yet lived to tell the tale			0
he 's battled his own demons and now on the other side of 50 , it 's obvious he has been the victor , " his website bio says .			0

@entity183 : " @entity22 " has been the @entity9 intro since ' 91
@entity3 *slammed* the @entity15 - @entity40 golf outing with a comment referring to @entity16
@entity3 says @entity1 " stepped on the toes of the @entity190 *''*
