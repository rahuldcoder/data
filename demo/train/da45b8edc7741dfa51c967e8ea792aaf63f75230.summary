-- @entity1 will be hit with fines in excess of $ 30 million as part of " significant , unprecedented penalties " expected to be announced monday by the @entity6 , a source familiar with the case told @entity0 on sunday			1
while the school 's football program will not face the so - called " death penalty " that would have prevented the team from playing in the fall , the school might have preferred a one - year suspension because of the severity of the scholarship losses , postseason sanctions and other penalties , the source said			1
" if i were @entity1 or any other school and were given both options , i 'd pick the death penalty , " the source said , adding the range of sanctions " is well beyond what has been done in the past " and " far worse than closing the program for a year			1
" the expected punishment is part of the continued fallout from the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach @entity32 , who was convicted in late june of 45 of the 48 counts he faced involving 10 young victims			1
the news came the same day the statue of @entity1 's iconic head football coach @entity37 was removed from outside the campus stadium			1
ireporter : this is an end of an era the @entity6 's punishments follow an independent investigation led by former fbi director @entity44 , whose report held four top @entity1 officials , including @entity37 , responsible for failing to stop the abuse			1
everything the @entity6 " needed to know was detailed in the @entity44 report , " according to the source			1
monday in @entity52 , the @entity6 plans a press conference " to announce @entity6 corrective and punitive measures for the @entity1 , " it said in a statement			1
the @entity6 last imposed the so - called " death penalty " to a football team in 1987 against @entity59 's program in the wake of a payments - to - athletes scandal			1
the source says the sanctions " will really paint a picture that essentially says that leadership failure and systemic failures ca n't be tolerated			2
" @entity6 president @entity68 wrote a letter to @entity1 president @entity70 in november that included four questions he wanted the university to answer			1
according to the source , the @entity6 felt the questions were answered by the @entity44 report and therefore it could act before the university responded			2
the source was n't sure if the university has been made aware of the penalties yet but says the university was not involved in the decision			2
it was " not a negotiated process , " the source said			0
while not divulging specifics , the source said , " the penalties go well beyond the loss of a scholarship or not being able to go to a bowl game			0
" the source also said the plan includes provisions to provide " leeway " and " minimize the impact " on current players who had nothing to do with the @entity32 scandal			0
photos : final tributes , @entity37 statue removed also sunday , in @entity98 , @entity99 , the 900 - pound bronze statue of @entity37 was removed			2
@entity1 president @entity70 said in a statement the statue is being stored in a " secure location			2
" the statue was removed exactly six months after @entity37 , the winningest coach in @entity105 football history , died of lung cancer			1
@entity37 had coached at @entity1 for 61 years , 15 of them as an assistant			1
he died less than three months after he coached his last game , an october 29 victory over @entity110 that gave him a record 409 wins			0
under @entity37 's 46 - season tenure as head coach , the @entity112 won two national championships , went undefeated five times , and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times			2
the tribute to the coach , who died in january , had become an object of contention after the child rape scandal involving @entity32			0
however , @entity37 's family said they believe taking down the statue serves no purpose			1
" tearing down the statue of @entity37 does not serve the victims of @entity32 's horrible crimes or help heal the @entity1 community			1
we believe the only way to help the victims is to uncover the full truth , " the family said in a statement			0
" it is not the university 's responsibility to defend or protect @entity37			0
but they at least should have acknowledged that important legal cases are still pending and that the record on @entity37 , the board and other key players is far from complete , " it added			0
@entity147 , a staff writer for the blog @entity149 , said there were about 100 people who watched the statue taken down , put on a forklift and driven into the stadium through a loading - dock door			0
@entity1 board member resigns over @entity32 scandal the @entity44 report found several @entity1 officials concealed evidence that @entity32 had sexually abused minors			0
@entity44 concluded that @entity37 could have prevented further sexual abuse had he taken action			0
" i now believe that , contrary to its original intention , coach @entity37 's statue has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing in our university and beyond , " @entity70 said			1
" i believe that , were it to remain , the statue will be a recurring wound to the multitude of individuals across the nation and beyond who have been the victims of child abuse , " he added			0
sunday , @entity1 employees began placing fencing around the statue , as well as a tarp			2
local and university police were at the scene , and some students gathered near the football field , @entity187			0
airborne banner : take down @entity37 statue another tribute to @entity37 -- the university library that bears his name -- will remain as it is , @entity70 said			2
" the library remains a tribute to @entity37 and @entity196 's commitment to @entity1 's student body and academic success , and it highlights the positive impacts coach @entity37 had on the university , " he wrote			1
the @entity202 ( @entity202 ) called @entity37 " a powerful man who acted selfishly " who " deserves no public honors whatsoever			0
" " we 're glad the statue is gone but that 's just a tiny step forward , " @entity202 spokesman @entity206 said in a statement			0
" we as a society must learn that a good way to deter child sex cover - ups is to punish , not praise , those who instigate such cover - ups			0
" @entity6 not ruling out tough sanctions on @entity1 football @entity32 is expected to be sentenced in september			1
his legal team has said it will appeal the convictions			0
two former university administrators are awaiting trial for their role in the scandal , and more charges are possible as the state 's attorney general investigates what @entity1 may have known about @entity32 's behavior			0
