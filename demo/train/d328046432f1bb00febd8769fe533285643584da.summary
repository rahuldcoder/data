the vast majority of airport employees with direct access to the tarmac and airplanes do not go through any daily security screening , and only two of the country 's major airports have systems in place that require all employees with secure access to pass through metal detectors , a @entity1 investigation has found			1
@entity1 was given exclusive access to one of those , @entity22 , and on a recent afternoon , employees lined up at a checkpoint where they passed through a metal detector as they reported to work			1
they gathered their belongings , swiped their badges and opened a door that leads down to the airport 's secure ramp area			0
" one of the greatest vulnerabilities for this airport and probably any other major airport like @entity22 is the insider threat , " @entity28 , the airport 's security director told @entity1			1
@entity22 has four checkpoints for employee screening , five vehicle access gates manned by airport workers , random background checks of employees and a mandatory security awareness class for all employees among a myriad of other security measures			1
the only other major airport that conducts full employee screenings is @entity47 , @entity48 , according to interviews with aviation officials			1
there is no federal requirement that the baggage handlers , mechanics , cleaning crews and other employees with access to the airfield and other secure areas get screened as passengers do			0
they are typically subject to a criminal background check and might get randomly screened while at work			0
by contrast , those who work at the gates , such as restaurant employees , pass through @entity69 security checkpoints			1
it 's an issue that will be discussed on tuesday at a hearing of a @entity72 and follows a high - profile case in @entity74			1
federal agents broke up a gun smuggling operation at @entity74 in december , arresting a @entity78 baggage handler and passenger			0
the baggage handler brought the guns to work , entered the gate area and passed the weapons onto a passenger who had already gone through security			0
the passenger transported guns on about 20 @entity78 flights from @entity74 to @entity89 last year , according to the arrest affidavit			0
@entity91 , unlike @entity22 and @entity47 , does not use metal detectors to screen workers with access to secure areas			1
a spokesperson told @entity1 , " we have expanded random inspections and increased our police presence			1
" in addition , the general manager of @entity74 's airport is expected to announce security changes at the upcoming hearing , according to a source familiar with his testimony			1
@entity78 declined to discuss specifics , but a spokesman said " safety and security are always @entity78 's top priority			0
" @entity1 contacted 20 major airports across the @entity114 to ask about security protocols for the so - called " back of the airport " employees			1
a spokesperson for @entity119 said employees with access to restricted areas do not have to pass through metal detectors but do carry badges verified by biometric scanners			0
representatives of other airports , such as @entity128 , @entity130 - @entity129 and @entity131 in @entity132 , said some employees with restricted access pass through metal detectors while others do not			1
" not all employees are required to go through metal detectors , " sgt. @entity137 with the @entity138 told @entity1			1
" there are several layers of security that are in place and part of that is training everyone that we are all responsible in ensuring the safety of our airports			1
" representatives from eight airports deferred @entity1 's questions on metal - detector screenings for employees to the @entity69 , which did not provide further information on the topic			1
@entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 in @entity162 did not respond to @entity1 's repeated requests for comment			2
even @entity22 's strict security protocol could be vulnerable , according to @entity28			0
" it 's not 100 percent foolproof , and we know that people are going to exploit the vulnerabilities that they can find , " she said			0
" we 're not just looking for terrorist activity			0
we have a range of threats			0
" last year , the airport confiscated 209 employee id badges for security violations			2
the airport has nearly 34,000 employees with @entity180 badges , and 33,150 who have access to restricted areas			2
airport police , emergency responders and federal law enforcement are the only ones who do not go through the checkpoints , @entity28 said			0
@entity22 began screening all employees through checkpoints after a 1999 drug smuggling plot in which dozens of ramp and food workers were arrested			2
a 2007 firearm and drug smuggling case in @entity47 's airport led to full employee screening as well			0
in response to the investigation of the smuggling that brought firearms from @entity74 to @entity89 , sen. @entity202 , @entity203 - @entity89 , called on the @entity69 to require all airline and airport employees to undergo physical screening every time they enter secure areas of airports			1
@entity202 referred to the lack of physical screening as a " gaping loophole in airport security " in a letter addressed to @entity69 acting administrator @entity215			2
" when guns , drugs , and even explosives are as easy to carry on board a plane as a neck pillow , then we have to seriously -- and immediately -- overhaul our airport security practices , " @entity202 said in january			2
in a statement , the @entity69 said it was " taking these recent incidents very seriously and has taken immediate steps to enhance site security at @entity74 and other major @entity114 airports			1
" @entity69 is implementing or considering a range of measures , including additional requirements for employee screening ; conducting additional , randomized security countermeasures at employee access points ; and introducing additional security patrols by @entity69 teams of law enforcement and screening professionals to specifically address these concerns			0
" additionally , @entity69 has created a working group with representation from airport security partners to further develop plans for improving security			2
" the @entity69 identified workers with access to secure areas of airports as one of the greatest potential threats to aviation , according to a 2009 report by the @entity253			2
the report said costs for full screening of airport and airline employees could range from $ 5.7 billion to $ 14.9 billion for the first year of implementation			2
the entire @entity69 budget for 2015 is $ 7.3 billion			0
@entity261 , a @entity22 - based security expert told @entity1 , " we have a saying in our business : budget driven security will always fail			1
" you do n't have to be a security expert -- a fifth - grader can tell you if you are checking at the top end , at the front end of the airport , you 've got to be checking the back end of the airport , " he said			0
