-- for most of us , hotel pillows are an afterthought			1
it takes a night of compromised sleeping positions and desperate pillow kneading in an attempt to create matter where none exists to highlight their actual significance			2
but there 's much to know about these under - appreciated accoutrements of the travel biz			0
as @entity15 , executive vice president for brand operations at @entity16 told us , " there 's more to pillows than just pillows			1
" like what ? glad you asked			0
that annoying pillow tag ? it fought smallpox the tags attached to pillows and comforters in the @entity28 that list the exact percentages of fills , be they foam or down ? according to the @entity33 , it 's known as a law label			1
while it might seem like government red tape , it 's actually a product of the 1800s when some less - than - scrupulous business people were stuffing their pillows and mattresses with old hospital blankets that might have carried smallpox and tuberculosis			1
and smallpox free ! 2			2
your hotel pillow is probably younger than the one you have at home according to @entity50 at @entity51 , a synthetic pillow lasts approximately 18 to 24 months when cared for and laundered properly , while a down or feather pillow can last 24 to 36 months			1
@entity15 from @entity16 says that pillows at @entity56 locations -- the budget arm of the @entity16 -- last less than 24 months , with properties replacing a third of their inventory every 6 to 8 months			1
for @entity56 , that means a purchase of 20,000 pillows in 2012			2
wyndham as a whole purchased more than a million pillows last year alone			1
housekeepers and hot dog vendors have something in common rather than tucking a laundered pillowcase under their chin , hospitality expert @entity70 says that hotel housekeepers have a chop - and-fold method of slipping pillows into pillowcases			1
" kind of like a hot dog bun , " he says			0
a 10 - year veteran of the hotel business , @entity70 's @entity85 bestselling book " heads in beds : a @entity86 , @entity87 , and so - called hospitality " was published last year			1
the hot dog bun trick could come in handy at home			2
surely there 's a @entity93 video out there			0
in the hotel biz , @entity95 = wtf @entity70 says that one thing that drives housekeepers bonkers is people who bring their own pillows			1
" that housekeeper is going to see hundreds of thousands of hotel pillows , " he explains			1
" why would you need to bring your own ? " for guests allergic to down - filled pillows , @entity70 says that hotels keep a large supply of foam pillows			1
while theft is n't that common , ( though @entity70 notes that some people will even take the batteries from the remote control ) the occasional guest will steal the pillows from the bed and pack them right into their bags			0
not all rock stars trash hotel rooms the same way @entity70 tells the story of the singer of a classic rock band who wanted 15 pillows for his bed			2
as requested , the pillows were piled on his bed in a huge pyramid			0
the next morning ? " they were scattered all over the floor , " says @entity70			0
" there is no way to sleep on that			0
" tell us who it is , please ? @entity137 ? @entity138 ? the @entity139 ? maybe @entity141 or @entity142 warbler @entity143 ? when pressed for the name , @entity70 , a true hotelier to his discreet core , declines to provide personal information concerning one of his guests			0
if you want a firm pillow , @entity149 is the place many hotels are known for their " pillow menus , " which give guests the choice of what they rest their head upon			2
but few pillow menus are as varied as the list at @entity149 , which has 16 pillows guests can choose from			1
alongside down and foam options are buckwheat , tatami and porcelain			0
porcelain pillows , as well as ones made from jade , wood and bronze , were popular in @entity172 from the 6th to early 20th centuries			0
you can get your hotel pillow personalized at the @entity178 , vip , suite and villa guests , and guests who have stayed five days at the property , get to sleep on pillowcases monogrammed with their initials			1
the hotel has more than a 1,000 pillowcases on hand in a variety of initial combinations , though for the @entity191 and @entity192 out there , monogramming a new pillow only takes five to 10 minutes			2
at the end of their stay , guests can take their pillowcases with them or opt to have them boxed for their next stay at the @entity178			0
in addition , many chains have websites such as hiltontohome.com and ritzcarltonshops.com that allow people to purchase hotel pillows for their homes			2
do n't think too hard about your hotel pillow ... or this article @entity70 says , like death and deli meat , people do n't think much about the life of a hotel pillow			1
and that 's a good thing			0
" when you put your head on a pillow it would blow your mind to think about how many other heads have been on that pillow , " he says			0
" if you go to a hotel and come back a year later and stay in the same room , you 're going to put your head on the same pillow and there are a lot of people who have done a lot of things on that pillow on the meantime			1
" whatever people do in their rooms , pillows are always there			0
they 're either directly involved or very nearby			0

the @entity16 purchased more than a million pillows last year
that annoying pillow tag ? it *helped* fight smallpox
some hotel guests bring their own pillows . housekeepers find this annoying
your hotel pillow is probably younger than the one you have at home
