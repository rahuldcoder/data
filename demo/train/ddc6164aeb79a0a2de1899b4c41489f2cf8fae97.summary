as @entity0 struggles to recover from one blow after another related to the devastating cyber attack , one may overlook the fact that its parent company in @entity6 has been a popular target of hackers for years			1
three years ago , in april 2011 , @entity0 's playstation network was shut down for nearly a month when hackers stole the personal information of an estimated 77 million people			1
that same year , in june , hackers released 150,000 @entity0 records including usernames and passwords and claimed to have compromised the private information of more than one million people			1
in october 2012 , hacker group " @entity20 " released a security key that allowed @entity23 users to run pirated games			0
despite those incidents , a group with suspected ties to @entity27 calling itself " @entity28 " was able to infiltrate @entity0 's computer system , steal an incredible amount of data , and use it to launch the most vicious cyber-attack in history on an @entity36 corporation			1
former @entity0 employees are suing the company for failing to protect their privacy			1
many are asking what lessons -- if any -- @entity0 learned from those previous hacks			1

" they can inflict damage			0
immense amount of damage to corporate america , " @entity51 says			0

and they are sometimes too far ahead of those trying to keep up			0
@entity80 says a devastating hack like the one on @entity0 can penetrate even the best cyber-defense			2

@entity0 appears to be trying to avoid further provoking @entity27 , the prime hacking suspect , telling @entity91 simply " the investigation is ongoing			2
" the @entity6 government is also distancing itself			2
a spokesperson for the @entity95 tells @entity91 the hack is a " @entity36 issue			0
" @entity51 says the world is coming to terms with the new reality of cyber-terrorism			0

@entity107 , a professor of @entity108 at @entity109 in @entity71 says the attack reveals lax cyber-security among @entity0 's ranks			1
but he suspects it is a more widespread problem in @entity6			2
" i think this is a wake - up call for @entity6 that this is a problem			2
this is a huge vulnerability			0
