-- @entity1 strains under the weight of its own @entity3			1
what with the towering minaret of @entity7 , the glorious @entity8 's tomb and the imposing @entity10 palace , visitors can feel swamped by the sheer abundance of history on display			2
but @entity16 's capital city provides more than just awe - inspiring spectacles of its ancient past			1
with a preponderance of market stalls , bazaars , shopping malls and street vendors , @entity1 is a consumer paradise , lending a much - needed retail counterpoint to all that earnest sightseeing			1
to help you separate the glad rags from the plain old rags , here 's @entity0 's at - glance - guide to shopping your way through @entity1			1
before you start if the city is just one port of call on an @entity16 - wide shopping spree ( with a few sights thrown in for good measure ) , bear in mind that you can arrange for most things -- large or small -- to be shipped back , so that it 's waiting patiently on your doorstep when you return home			1
there are international couriers everywhere , and most hotels can help you arrange shipments for an almost disconcertingly small fee			0
@entity50 for the most authentic and down - to - earth shopping experience head to " @entity50 " in south - west @entity1			1
modeled around a traditional rural marketplace ( a " haat " ) , it features some 200 individual stalls that form a permanent @entity56 arts - and - crafts bazaar			1
this is a great place to buy original hand - made items directly from the producers themselves , with artisans from across the country selling everything from panel - beaten silver jewelry to brightly colored linens and vast decorative ornaments			2
be aware , the stalls operate on a rotating basis -- so , if you see something you like , buy it on sight , as the vendor may have disappeared by tomorrow			2
@entity50 is not for the hesitant consumer and haggling the best price is standard practice			0
@entity76 those keen to combine consumer therapy with a bit of heritage should wander over to the @entity76 -- one of the largest crafts museums in @entity16			0
the 20,000 or so exhibits feature centuries - old textiles , rare metal works and intricately crafted clay pots			2
but the souvenir shop is almost equally as impressive , with ink drawings on parchment , handmade @entity90 shawls , mirrored fabrics and many other quintessentially @entity16 arts and crafts available for purchase			0
in addition , there are often live demonstrations by craftsmen , whose wares go on sale hot off the production line			0
read related : new fashions inspired by @entity1 @entity103 a pilgrimage site for bargain - hunting fashionistas , the @entity103 stocks all the latest couture designs before they hit @entity107 and @entity108 boutiques with eye - popping mark - ups			1
export surpluses and last - minute canceled lines are dumped here en - masse , so check for holes , faulty zips , stains and missing buttons before handing over your cash			2
there are no changing rooms as it 's not much more than a long road with make - shift shops on both sides			1
that said , prices are so low that buyer 's remorse is a rare experience , with entire wardrobes bought for less than the price of a few beers			0
@entity135 if you 're fearful of tourist traps and you 're just not the haggling type , then the government - run emporiums dotted across the capital offer fixed pricing and quality - assured " @entity16 " produce			0
each emporium tends to have its own specialism , showcasing products from different states			0
for instance , head to @entity149 for blankets and shawls ; @entity152 for sandalwood products ; @entity154 for the incredible stone - inlay work popularized by the @entity156 , as well as copper , brasswork and leather items ; @entity159 is the place for carpets ; and @entity162 for fabrics and traditional paintings			2
if you 've only time for one , however , then the @entity165 is the place to go			0
-- a six - storey @entity170 's cave selling everything from giant ornamental gods to packets of exquisitely scented @entity175 tea			2
@entity176 if the rag - tag pandemonium of @entity1 's more traditional bazaars and market stalls is taking its toll , or you hanker for the sight of some familiar shops , then the row of upscale designer boutiques , cosmetic outlets and chain stores in @entity176 will be just the ticket			1
with the ex-pat market in mind ( the diplomatic enclave is a stone 's throw away ) the shops here offer home - sick holiday makers the reassurance of popular brands such as the @entity199 and @entity200 -- and there 's even a @entity202 for the culinarily incurious			1
but this is also the place to pick up fine gourmet groceries -- such as @entity206 pesto and @entity208 baguettes -- that will otherwise be difficult to source in other parts of town			0
beware , prices are sometimes more upmarket than the goods on offer			0
@entity215 no self - respecting shopper could visit @entity1 without taking the rickshaw ride down to @entity218 , the old city 's famously frenetic merchant district			1
spilling over with shops peddling luminous candies , vividly - colored saris and shawls , homecare products , discount electrical goodies , and much , much else besides , this traffic - choked thoroughfare is worth a trip for the atmosphere alone			0
haggling like your life depends on it is just part of the fun .			0

with a history that spans *millennia* , @entity1 is *replete* with ancient *monuments* and *wonders* of the world
the city 's bazaars and street vendors also make it a bargain - hunter 's paradise .
