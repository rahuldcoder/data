@entity0 -- @entity3 's pro-democracy demonstrations have been front - page fodder this past week in international media , which have painted the story as a @entity9 - and - @entity8 struggle between local @entity10 and a powerful but distant authoritarian master in @entity12			1
but no such headlines have appeared in @entity14 , where the story has been buried deep inside most newspapers and tv broadcasts , and is framed in a way that makes it uninteresting and unintelligible to average @entity14			0
the coverage consists mostly of @entity12 's reactions to events with little or no explanation of what actually happened to prompt such response			0
the result is a hodgepodge of reports condemning the protests , saying that @entity3 leader @entity29 will never resign , and editorials declaring such protests will never spread to @entity14			1
it has also been noteworthy for the relative lack of images			0
from a media perspective , the demonstrations now taking place are a journalist 's dream come true , featuring colorful and action - filled images of protesters , police , politicians and conflict that make for great tv viewing and photos			2
yet none of those images have found their way into @entity14 's official media , almost certainly on direct orders from propaganda officials who worry such pictures could inspire others in @entity14 to take similar action			1
strict bans on such inflammatory images are quite common in order - obsessed @entity14 , even when such protests are pro-chinese			1
one such ban was a central feature in domestic coverage of a major territorial dispute with @entity63 two years ago , with major protests that broke out around @entity14 eerily absent from all domestic reports			0
old trick @entity14 's media have also resorted to another old trick of covering the conflict using editorials , which offer a backdoor route into the story with little or no broader context			1
in this case the official @entity75 newspaper @entity74 has taken the lead with a series of forceful editorials repeating that such protests are illegal and adding that such actions will never spread to @entity14			1
such editorializing has been a popular tool for stating official views on sensitive subjects since 1949 , and was widely used in 2010 when @entity85 got into a high - profile dispute over @entity12 's stipulations that it self - censor its @entity14 - based search site			0
that conflict ultimately saw @entity85 withdrawal from the @entity14 search market , only to be cast by @entity14 media as a cry baby that could n't compete with local rivals			2
@entity12 has also dusted off its tried - and - true tactic of using key " buzzwords " to control the tone of the story			0
two such buzzwords this time have been " illegal , " to describe the nature of the @entity3 demonstrations , and " in accordance with the law , " to describe how the @entity14 - friendly @entity29 administration is handling the situation			2
finally there 's the social media element , which is a new game not only for @entity14 but governments throughout the world as they try to harness this powerful force to influence public opinion			0
social media in this case , a number of commentaries have been making the rounds on popular social media platforms like @entity119 , playing on themes that criticize the protesters for everything from threatening @entity3 's prosperity to harboring broader hostility toward all mainland @entity14			1
these stories by little - known writers could be genuine , but are most likely a variation on another @entity12 tactic to control online public opinion in the internet age			0
known by the disparaging moniker of the " @entity133 , " this loosely defined group 's " members " reportedly receive government payment for posing as independent commentators who seed the internet with opinions favorable to the central government 's policies and views			0
the latest protests in @entity3 may be providing new challenges for @entity12 's leadership from a new generation of democracy - seeking activists on @entity14 's periphery			1
but the tactics being used by @entity14 's media are anything but new , with @entity12 resorting to a wide range of time - tested reporting tricks in its bid to shape the issue in the realm of domestic public opinion .			2

@entity3 's pro-democracy protests have been front - page news except in @entity14
coverage has been limited , with focus on editorials that lack broader context
few images of the protests have been shown on @entity14 media
authorities fear pictures could inspire others in @entity14 to take similar actions
