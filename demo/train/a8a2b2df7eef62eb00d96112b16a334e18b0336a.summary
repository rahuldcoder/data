when @entity1 , 24 , returned to @entity2 after studying in the @entity3 , she had real trouble securing a job			0
she had the right qualifications for the positions she was looking for -- she just was n't a man			0
" i was on a job hunting site and saw this ideal position as a marketing manager			0
one of the requirements was that i had to be male , " she told @entity13			0
" if i am desperate i will apply anyway because i think i am qualified			0
but i 'll send them an extra video outlining why i can do the job despite being female			0
" this happened a fortnight ago , just weeks after a similar gender discrimination case made headlines in @entity23			1
recent graduate @entity24 took @entity2 - based private tutor company @entity25 to court after they refused to employ her on the basis of being female			1
the company later settled for 30,000 rmb ( us $ 4,925 ) , in what has been described as the first gender discrimination lawsuit of its kind in the @entity23			1
' important breakthrough ' @entity33 from @entity34 , an ngo that promotes the rights of workers in @entity23 , described the @entity2 case as " an important breakthrough			1
" he says he expects more women to actively challenge discrimination moving forward but cautioned against being too optimistic			1
" it is very difficult to get courts in @entity23 to accept discrimination cases , as @entity24 herself experienced , " @entity33 told @entity13			1
" very often employers blatantly discriminate because demand for a particular job is very high and they can get away with setting strict and discriminatory stipulations			0
" @entity49 , 28 , knows a thing or two about this			0
upon graduating from a top @entity2 university , she spent a year working as a headhunter			0
there she was approached by clients who specified only male candidates			0
factory - based jobs and those within engineering were two professions commonly demanding male applicants , as were roles that involved travel or working overseas			1
" there 's a perception that ( travel ) to certain countries is not safe for women , and also that if a woman is older her priorities will be more home - based , whereas the man 's will still be work first , " she said			1
@entity49 experienced discrimination herself upon changing jobs			1
she was working as a teacher 's assistant at a well - established tutorial company in @entity2 and when her boss left , he referred @entity49 to the director as the best person to fill his role			2
the director , though , wanted a man			0
@entity49 lost out to someone more junior than her			0
" at my company the high - level positions were usually filled by men , " she noted			2
data in the @entity96 , jointly carried out in 2010 by the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) and the @entity98 , revealed that more than 72 % of women had a clear perception of " not being hired or promoted because of gender " discrimination			1
over 75 % believed they were dismissed due to marriage and childbirth , with fears that this could worsen as @entity23 relaxes its one - child policy			1
meanwhile , the federation calculated that urban @entity111 women in 2010 earned 0.67 rmb for every 1 rmb men earned , down from 0.78 rmb in 1990			2
from overt to recessive women must also compete amongst themselves			1
in @entity23 , where applicants often attach a photograph to their cvs , there are jobs requiring women to measure up to a certain level of attractiveness			1
in her book , @entity124 : @entity126 in @entity23 , anthropologist @entity125 noted the prevalence of job ads with detailed appearance and height requirements for women			1
the @entity111 government itself is guilty of this , she says			0
" they are trying to attract the tallest or the prettiest people , because it makes ( the government departments ) look good , " @entity125 wrote			0
" the belief that better looks secure better jobs has pushed more and more @entity111 college students to spend lavish amounts of money on cosmetic surgery			0
" she told @entity13 the situation has changed since her research back in 2006 - 7 , saying there are fewer of these ads around nowadays -- but she is also wary			2
" gender discrimination in employment still widely exists in @entity23 's workplace in different ways that are hidden			1
the discrimination has changed from overt to recessive , whilst the situation might be even worse because hidden prejudice and discrimination against women is harder to avoid and punish			1
" leveling the playing field some women adapt to the situation			2
as a teenager , @entity163 wanted to be a doctor			0
her mother had other plans , telling her that , " medicine is not a good profession for a woman to be in -- it will not attract a man			0
" instead @entity163 became a journalist and satisfies herself with writing medical stories			0
@entity163 's story touches on a greater phenomenon , namely women are still being engineered to see marriage as their first priority and career as second			2
those who fail to conform to this stereotype risk being labeled a " leftover			0
" read more : @entity23 's ' leftover women ' choose to stay single @entity186 is a member of lean in @entity2 , a women 's professional development group inspired by @entity191 chief operating officer @entity190 's bestselling book @entity189			1
for her , this attitude is troubling			0
a 25 - year - old @entity194 coordinator in the telecommunications industry , she says that plenty of her female counterparts were ambitious at school and college , but their ambition later disappeared			2
" when we step out of school and enter the society , all of the goals turn to the pressure of marrying a good husband			0
it becomes the major standard of how we evaluate our life , " she told @entity13			0
this is a far cry from when the @entity210 came to power in 1949 , when elevating the status of women was central to their manifesto			2
chairman @entity216 famously declared that women hold up half the sky and , superficially at least , went about promoting women into jobs previously designated to men			2
but it 's not all bad in today 's @entity23			1
according to the 2014 @entity224 , 17 of the 358 @entity3 - dollar billionaires living in @entity23 are women ( up from 14 a year ago ) , and 19 % of @entity111 women in management positions are @entity228			1
the perception women are on the rise has even led to the coining of a phrase -- yin sheng , yang shuai -- which means the female ( yin ) is on the up , while the male ( yang ) is moving down			2
celebrating women the wrong way the @entity111 treatment of @entity242 , which still features in the @entity111 annual calendar on march 8 , shows the disparity between rhetoric and reality			1
once seen as an occasion to highlight the plight of women , it has now become another commercial opportunity , like @entity252 or @entity253			2
some companies give women time off ; others provide presents for their female staff -- often presents that feed into gender stereotypes			1
in 2013 , a total of 1.72 million men bought gifts for women in the 10 days leading up to @entity242 , according to a report issued by @entity266 , @entity23 's largest online shopping website			1
beauty vouchers and kitchen supplies were a dominant theme			0
retailers commonly offer sales on women 's products as well			2
with @entity242 approaching , the offers are already on display -- bouquets of flowers , and nice accessories to give to your wife , mother or employee			1
@entity111 women are once again being reminded that when it comes to work , there 's a gulf between themselves and their male cohorts .			0

discrimination against women in rife in @entity23
*successfully* - fought gender discrimination cases are almost *nonexistent*
discrimination changing from " overt " to " recessive "
@entity242 celebrations in @entity23 can be *misguided*
