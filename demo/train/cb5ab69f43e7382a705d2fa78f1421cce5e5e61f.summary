-- " any analyst at any time can target anyone			0
any selector , anywhere ... i , sitting at my desk , certainly had the authorities to wiretap anyone , from you or your accountant , to a federal judge , to even the president			0
... " thus spoke -- this time not @entity14 , the @entity16 prophet -- but former @entity18 systems administrator @entity17			1
to be sure , @entity17 was reaching for dramatic effect , but if his words were true , he would have been violating not only the laws of the @entity23 , he would also have been violating the laws of physics			0
he had neither the authority nor the ability to do what he has claimed he could do			0
to determine what we think of @entity17 's allegations about the @entity18 's activities , we should have a clear idea of what the @entity18 is actually doing , not what @entity17 implies or alleges or what some 24/7 networks allow their commentators to proclaim			1
the confusion is not entirely @entity17 's fault			0
the story has been so badly mangled by the media that one of the @entity46 's " exposes " ( on the prism program ) has been rewritten , without benefit of announcing corrections , on the newspaper 's website			0
so let us begin where @entity17 did -- with the " telephony metadata " or business records program			2
it is clear that the @entity18 has access to large numbers of calling events that @entity23 create : who called whom , when and for how long , but neither the location of the communicants nor certainly the contents of the call			1
why in heaven 's name would they want this " metadata " -- the term of art applied to the externals of a communication , somewhat like what is on an envelope as opposed to the content of a letter ? i 'll tell you why			1
before the attacks of 9/11 , @entity80 and @entity81 ( part of the @entity84 " muscle " on the plane that struck the @entity86 ) were living in @entity87			2
from there on several occasions they called an @entity84 safe house in the @entity92 whose communications were targeted by @entity23 intelligence			0
the @entity18 intercepted a series of these calls and created intelligence reports on several of them			1
but nothing in the physics of these intercepts or in the contents of these calls ( even looking at them in retrospect ) told us that these two known terrorists were in the @entity23			1
after the 9/11 attacks , the intelligence committees of the @entity107 formed a joint inquiry commission to determine what had gone wrong			2
one of the commission 's findings was to criticize the " @entity18 's cautious approach to any collection of intelligence relating to activity in the @entity23			1
" years later , in his 2008 book , " @entity119 , " @entity120 -- a chronicler and inveterate critic of @entity18 activities and , it should be added , a participant in a lawsuit against the agency for its post- 9/11 activities -- wrote about @entity80 and @entity128 that " the @entity18 never alerted any ( emphasis his ) other @entity18 that the terrorists were in the @entity23 and moving across the country toward @entity132			1
" to be sure , the @entity18 never knew they were in the @entity23 , but a career critic of alleged @entity18 privacy violations ( @entity135 ) thought the agency did and should have known these two terrorists were in ( that 's my emphasis ) this country and the @entity107 believed the @entity18 too " cautious " about intelligence in ( my emphasis again ) @entity23			1
the metadata program was an attempt to deal with this challenge with the lightest possible impact on @entity23 privacy			2
after all , the @entity148 had determined decades earlier ( @entity150 v. @entity151 , 1979 ) that metadata carried no expectations of privacy			0
thus , it seemed the perfect approach			0
properly used , metadata collection was not about targeting @entity23			0
it was about determining who in @entity23 deserved ( in all meanings of the word : legally , morally , operationally ) to be targeted			0
and , as @entity160 , the acting head of the @entity161 at the @entity162 during this period , has pointed out , " at least 14 federal judges have approved the @entity18 's acquisition of this data every 90 days since 2006 under the business records provision of the @entity168 ( @entity168 )			1
" billions of records are retained by the @entity18 under this program , but these records are accessed only under strict controls			2
no data mining engines or complex logarithmic tools are launched to scour the data for abstract patterns			0
instead , the data lies fallow until the @entity18 can put a question to it based on a predicate related to terrorism and only terrorism			2
a little more than 20 people at the @entity18 get to do this , under close supervision , and the agency reports that this happens about 300 times a year			1
let me describe a possible example of a " terrorist predicate			0
" let 's say that somewhere in the world @entity23 intelligence comes across an individual it has good reason to believe is an @entity84 operative , and he has a cell phone in his possession			0
under this authority , the @entity18 could take the cell phone number and use a computer simply to ask that ocean of metadata , " is there any activity in here related to what we now believe to be a terrorist telephone ? " and if a number in the @entity213 timidly raises its hand ( so to speak ) and answers , " why , yes , i routinely communicate with it , " the agency gets to ask , " and who do you and your friends talk to ? " that 's it ! if there is anything more to be done , the agency ( actually , far more likely , the @entity222 ) has to go back to court to dig any deeper into @entity23 information			1
this is hardly the @entity229 , but there may be some in @entity23 who are still discomfited by it			0
but folks should object based on facts rather than on the oft heard and amazingly misinformed commentary in some of the media that claims the @entity18 can then go back and listen to these calls in its database -- listen to calls that have never been recorded and which , incidentally , are protected by the @entity23 @entity242			1
and for those who still object , please keep in mind that , if the metadata program had been in effect in the summer of 2001 , @entity246 and @entity128 would likely have been rolled up , the plane that hit the @entity86 would not have had these jihadists available for the hijacking and the entire 9/11 enterprise might have been scrapped by @entity84			2
in my next column , i 'll tackle : what of the @entity255 , the collection of internet content with the compelled cooperation of @entity23 firms ? and how is that enterprise viewed here and abroad ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity263 .			1

@entity263 : many have *misconstrued* @entity18 access to phone calls
he says agency has information on calls but not content of the calls
@entity263 says agency needs metadata on calls to track terrorists
he says @entity18 was criticized in wake of 9/11 for not detecting the plot
