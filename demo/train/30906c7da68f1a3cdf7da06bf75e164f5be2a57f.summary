most road rage incidents do n't amount to much			1
a rude gesture or two			1
everyone gets it out of their system and life goes on			1
but sometimes it takes a tragic turn			1
last week in @entity11 , a mother of four was killed in an apparent road rage case			1
police say @entity15 died of a gunshot wound to the head after a suspect followed her home and opened fire			1
@entity21 and the man argued over a traffic incident earlier in the day			1
a study published in the @entity25 in @entity26 in 2010 concluded that one - third of the people it surveyed reported road rage			1
a 2013 @entity31 poll said the number of drivers who say they feel " uncontrollable anger toward another driver " has doubled from eight years earlier			1
the number is 12 % , or more than 1 in every 10 drivers on the road			1
a couple of things appear to be making matters worse , much worse : cameras and guns			1
in this age of social media , it seems natural to document everything in our lives			1
but experts say snapping a photo or video of the person you feel has wronged you on the road does n't help matters			1
back off from aggressive drivers if you get cut off , back off , take a deep breath , and remain calm			1
now you 're read for what comes next			1
if you need to vent , wait to you get home , then talk to a friend			1
know your driving style if you 're an aggressive driver , you might be the problem			2
are you provoking other drivers ? these are the habits of aggressive drivers : tailgating overuse of the horn flashing headlights changing lanes quickly , often and without signaling guesturing to other drivers talking or texting on your cellphone -- from @entity74 in a video posted this month to @entity76 , a man in @entity78 , @entity79 , is seen cursing at a woman and spitting on her windshield after she photographs his license plate			2
the man was charged with reckless driving and later apologized for his behavior			2
last month , a mother in @entity88 began to videotape another driver she said was acting aggressively			2
" this person in front of me is being a real ... character right now , " she says on the video			2
moment later , the driver is seen lashing out , banging on the woman 's car window : " you stupid ( expletive )			2
" " you 're taking the chance of shooting footage of someone who 's enraged and could that further enrage them ? it 's hard to say ... but you 're taking a risk , " said @entity104 of the @entity105			2
" the most important thing ... is to get out of the situation , " he said			2
" you do n't want to escalate it to that point where there 's someone so enraged where they 're not thinking about what they are doing			2
" with guns just slightly less ubiquitous than cameras these days , drivers face a second far greater risk in road rage incidents			1
in 2013 , @entity123 was driving on @entity124 near @entity125 , @entity126 , when he noticed a man driving recklessly in and out of the emergency lane			2
he pulled out his phone and started shooting video			0
first , he tried to get the license plate number , then @entity132 pulled alongside to get a shot of the driver			0
that 's when the man driving the car rolled down his window and appeared to fire a shot			0
no one got hurt , but lesson learned			0
" i was scared , " he said			0
" it was a little crazy			0
" late last year , a family in @entity144 narrowly escaped after a driver opened fire , after a roadway altercation			0
the gunman followed them to a strip mall and started shooting			0
the family dog jumped in , taking a bullet for the family			0
" they were fired upon and their family was terrorized , " @entity144 police @entity154 told @entity1 affiliate @entity156			0
" they survived that only to find that their pet is now gone			0
" so what can be done about it ? last year , @entity165 came out with a road rage survey			1
it found that drivers in @entity169 , @entity144 and @entity170 are the least courteous			0
@entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 are at the most			0
@entity174 offers some suggestions on how to handle road rage			1
back off from aggressive drivers : you ca n't control them so give them some room to operate			0
know your own driving style : maybe you 're the bad guy or gal. maybe you 're provoking the drivers around you			0
and here 's another thing to think about			0
you never know who 's behind the wheel of the other car			0
they might just be having a bad day or maybe have some serious problems			0
or you could find yourself in a situation like the one portrayed in a @entity196 public service announcement featuring @entity197			0
an angry man , who calls out a driver who cut him off , finds himself face - to - face with the menacing former heavyweight champ			0
the punchline ? " avoid road rage			1
you never know who you might run into			0

a @entity31 poll says road rage is *increasing*
