-- it 's not been an excellent year on television for @entity4 characters			1
on friday @entity5 released two of its reports , the seventh annual @entity8 and the 18th annual where we are on tv report , and none of the networks received an excellent rating for having diverse @entity4 characters and stories			1
@entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 were rated as " good " ; @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 were " adequate " ; and @entity29 and @entity30 received " failing " marks			2
the ratings in the index were based on @entity4 - inclusive content between june 2012 and may 2013 , while where we are on tv relied on a character count and analysis of scripted characters in the upcoming 2013 - 2014 season			0
according to the data , the percentage of primetime broadcast scripted @entity4 series regulars dropped to 3.3 % from a record high of 4.4 % last season			0
there was diversity , however			0
the report showed that there will be an equal number of women and men among @entity4 characters during the 2013 - 2014 broadcast season , which means the storylines are moving beyond just featuring white gay males			0
" last season was a stellar one when it comes to the sheer number of gay , lesbian and bisexual representations on television , though diversity within those storylines showed room for improvement , " said a statement from @entity5 's @entity59			1
" though the number of @entity4 characters dropped this season , shows like ' @entity72 , ' with an interracial female couple raising a family , and characters like @entity76 on ' @entity77 ' have not only moved the conversation about @entity4 people forward , but are also a hit with audiences			0
" some of the other findings include : " our television images not only reach @entity28 audiences , but countless others around the world , " @entity59 said			2
" it is time for the television networks to make new and groundbreaking @entity4 stories a priority once again			1
