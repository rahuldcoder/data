@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 lost some strength as it spiraled northwest through the @entity1 on sunday , but its hulking presence threatened more damage and evoked frightening memories , 13 months after deadly @entity8 blasted the same region			1
" last year , many people were asking , ' is it the will of @entity16 , or the wrath of @entity16 ? ' but now , they just feel it is part of nature , " the rev. @entity10 of @entity12 's @entity11 said			2
while @entity8 killed more than 6,000 people , the @entity1 government is blaming only two deaths on @entity3 so far			1
on monday morning , the storm weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical storm by the @entity27 military 's @entity25			1
one - year - old @entity30 and @entity31 , 55 , both of @entity32 in the central @entity1 , died from hypothermia in the storm , @entity29 executive director @entity28 told a press briefing on sunday			1
more than 900,000 people from nearly 200,000 families have been adversely affected by the cyclone , locally known as " @entity39 , " @entity28 said			1
almost all of them have sought help at evacuation centers			2
@entity2 meteorologist @entity44 forecast that @entity3 would move west on monday , just south of the capital city of @entity46 , with strong winds and potentially devastating rains			1
the storm , which has battered several regions of the @entity1 since saturday , poses dangers of flooding and landslides from a volcano			1
a day after @entity3 made landfall on @entity56 , the massive cyclone crept across the country sunday at about 15 kph ( 9 mph )			1
that sluggish pace means @entity3 had more time to dump relentless rainfall over the same areas , making severe flooding a possibility			1
what 's worse : the storm passed not far from the @entity65			1
officials are now keeping an eye on the volcano , known for its almost perfectly symmetrical cone shape , because heavy rainfall could mix with the volcanic ash and spur major landslides			2
not only could the force of a landslide wreak havoc on homes , the debris could go into streams , rivers and reservoirs around the volcano , blocking them up and causing even more flooding			1
millions affected about 40 million people are close to the path of the storm and its fierce winds , which reached 160 kph ( 100 mph ) sunday			2
@entity86 of @entity87 is one of those who evacuated to a local church			2
" i do n't know how long i 'm going to be here , as the roof was blown off my house last night , " she said sunday morning			1
her home -- a typical wooden and metal shack -- was already wiped out last year			2
after @entity8 , she spent more than 20 days at the church , lying between pews with her children			2
despite the potential danger , some residents in @entity0 , in the shadow of the @entity65 , ignored evacuation orders and vowed to stay in their makeshift beachside homes			0
" i think we can handle the situation , " one man said			0
" if or when it gets worse , we 'll go to the evacuation center			0
" a woman who lives on the coast was also defiant			2
" we 've been here 25 years and seen many typhoons , " she said			0
" this one already feels stronger than @entity8 ( last year ) , but we wo n't leave yet			0
" gen. @entity111 , chief of staff of armed forces , said sunday that soldiers were working to clear roads and airports so that emergency services could be delivered			0
eleven nations had offered assistance , including @entity119 , the @entity27 , @entity120 , @entity121 and the @entity122			1
weakening before @entity46 @entity3 should be even weaker by the time it passes near @entity46 on monday evening			1
the biggest threat in the capital will come from the heavy rainfall			0
that likely will lead to flash flooding and mudslides , even in places far from the storm 's center			1
several airports were closed sunday , leading to 185 domestic flight cancellations , @entity28 said			0
once debris is cleared from some of those airports , the @entity1 military will fly @entity140 planes from @entity46 and @entity141 to affected areas with necessary supplies , he added			1
flooding , landslides , and fallen trees are hampering government efforts to drive relief essentials to affected areas			1
" our emphasis now is road - clearing operations , " @entity28 said			0
" do n't worry if you are thinking we 're out of supply			0
there may be delay due to roads that are not passable , " he said			0
fishermen fears typhoon will ' destroy everything ' @entity12 dodges bullet one city farther south breathed a sigh of relief sunday			2
in @entity12 , the streets were empty because residents had already evacuated			0
last year , @entity8 devastated @entity12 , killing more than 6,000 people and leaving 200,000 people homeless			0
many people in @entity12 are still living in tents or other rudimentary structures more than a year after @entity8			0
at least 100,000 people evacuated @entity12 before @entity3 struck , the @entity173 humanitarian agency @entity172 said			1
that 's half the population of the city			0
mayor @entity177 told @entity2 the city is without power , but he 's seen only minor damage such as broken windows and downed trees			0
many roads were flooded , but not impassable			0
" there was a lot of preparation , " @entity172 spokeswoman @entity183 said			0
" i think that the lessons learned were very hard ones in @entity12 ... because there were so many lives lost , and i think they 've really taken cognizance this time and really made an all - out effort everywhere to bring people to safety			0
" @entity1 gets more than its share of disasters @entity198 reported from @entity0 ; @entity199 and @entity200 reported and wrote from @entity201			1
@entity2 's @entity202 , @entity44 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0
