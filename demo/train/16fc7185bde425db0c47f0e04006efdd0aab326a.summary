-- if there 's one thing we can all agree on when it comes to " @entity7 " star @entity6 and the fallout from his interview with @entity10 , it 's that everyone has an opinion			1
and , to be honest , that 's about the only thing we can agree on			2
in the 24 hours since @entity10 released its january profile of @entity6 and his family , who draw millions to @entity17 with their reality show " @entity7 , " social media has seen more than its typical overuse of exclamation points and excessive capitalization			1
the back - and - forth has gotten so extensive , we would n't be surprised if you 've forgotten what you 're even arguing about			2
but to be fair , this roiling debate is so addictive because the news here -- that @entity6 shared viewpoints and beliefs that many , including @entity17 , found offensive , and was suspended indefinitely as a result -- gets to the heart of conversations many of us care about			1
this discussion may have been started with a single question : what does @entity6 , a professed born - again @entity37 , consider to be sinful ? but it 's now sprawled into even more complex territories like media responsibility and the difference -- if there is one -- between having an opinion and being a bigot			1
that last topic has been particularly difficult to tease out			0
@entity6 told @entity10 that he considers homosexual behavior , among other things , to be sinful			1
to some , @entity6 did nothing more than answer a question during an off - camera interview			1
whether one agrees with his statement or not , it 's been said , is not the point -- he should n't have been reprimanded for honestly answering a question			1
" i 'm gay and i do n't care what others think , nor should other people			0
this guy did not offend me , " @entity61 posted on @entity0 's @entity63 page			0
" some people have different beliefs , and i respect that			0
let the guy stay on the show			0
there is something called free speech ! our freedom of speech is slowly being taken away from us , when it was once considered a huge part of the foundation of this country			1
" however , there are many others who read @entity6 's words and saw the language of a bigot -- someone who treats members of a group with hatred and intolerance			1
in that view , his stance on homosexuality exceeds the boundaries of opinion or faith , and veers into discrimination			0
" ' is this man simply expressing his beliefs or spewing bigotry ? ' i do n't see a distinction between the two , " said another @entity0 commenter			1
" whatever the ' reasons ' you have for being bigoted , at the end of the day , it 's still bigotry			1
you ca n't hide behind ' it 's my religious beliefs ' as a justification for bad behavior			2
" and that 's where we all get stuck : one man 's idea of what constitutes an opinion -- or a spiritually prescribed value system -- is another man 's idea of hateful rhetoric			0
this debate has even seeped into the political arena			0
@entity122 gov. @entity121 issued a statement in defense of @entity6 and his family , calling them " great citizens of the @entity122			2
" " i do n't agree with quite a bit of stuff i read in magazine interviews or see on tv			0
in fact , come to think of it , i find a good bit of it offensive , " @entity121 said			0
" but i also acknowledge that this is a free country and everyone is entitled to express their views			0
in fact , i remember when tv networks believed in the @entity142			0
it is a messed up situation when @entity144 gets a laugh , and @entity6 gets suspended			1
" the counterpoint to @entity121 's position ? @entity17 has the right to act on their belief that @entity6 was in the wrong			1
" we are extremely disappointed to have read @entity6 's comments in @entity10 , which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series ' @entity7 , ' " the network said in a statement wednesday			1
" his personal views in no way reflect those of @entity159 , who have always been strong supporters and champions of the lgbt community			0
the network has placed @entity6 under hiatus from filming indefinitely			2
" to many @entity0 commenters , including one with the intriguing handle " trollmuch , " @entity6 's freedom of speech has n't been infringed upon : " he has a right to speak his mind , but @entity17 has the right to take action			1
" one voice that has n't been heard from as much in this debate is that of the @entity10 profile 's writer , @entity176			2
while the magazine is n't offering further comment on what 's transpired , it did point @entity0 toward @entity176 's reflection and outtakes from the article posted on @entity185			2
the writer explains there that while he does n't agree with @entity6 's politics , he also is n't calling for the man 's head			1
" whenever you meet face - to - face with people you do n't necessarily see eye - to - eye with and talk to them and drink lots of beer with them , you 're almost always more likely to understand them and like them			0
that 's how it works , " @entity176 writes			0
" i do n't agree with @entity6 's politics , and i have a lot of gay relatives and colleagues who would bristle at @entity6 's ' hate the sin , love the sinner ' view of homosexuality			1
... but i still like @entity6 and found him to be an otherwise decent fellow			2
i think it 's all right to think that , and i think it 's all right to hope that whatever fuss arises out of his comments -- it 's happening already -- will soften him a bit toward what he believes to be wicked behavior			0
consider this my own version of ' hate the sin , love the sinner			0
' " a perspective which , we can all agree , is bound to elicit more opinions .			0

the fallout over @entity6 being suspended from " @entity7 " has been immense
it 's *expanded* into a *critical* discussion about faith , freedom of speech and bigotry
on one side , some think @entity6 should n't be reprimanded for answering a question
on the other , there 's the argument that bigotry should n't be *protected*
