@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 claimed the all - time @entity5 record for minutes without conceding a goal during @entity8 's 1 - 0 win over @entity9 on sunday			1
triumphant : @entity3 holds the @entity5 goalkeeping record for most time without conceding			1
the @entity14 veteran also took the 30 - year - old @entity16 record from @entity17 last week			1
@entity17 's name , with all due respect to the former @entity20 custodian , is not up there with the game 's greats			1
so who is in @entity3 's league as football 's finest shot - stoppers , the men who rarely get the credit but often cop the flak ? here , @entity32 presents a run down of the best goalkeepers in history			1
read through our picks and tell us if you disagree or if we 've missed anyone in the sound off box below			1
what do you think of van der @entity3 's inclusion ? @entity45 ( @entity46 ) @entity47 is the only goalkeeper ever to be named @entity48 , in 1963			1
dubbed the @entity49 for his all - black outfit and what seemed like eight limbs , the @entity53 even invented the concept of the keeper as sweeper			1
in the days when keepers were not protected by referees as they are today , @entity45 's bravery and acrobatics were legendary and 207 clean sheets and 150 penalties saves he made in a 22 - year career tell their own story			2
the best keeper at each @entity66 is presented with the @entity67			2
@entity68 ( @entity69 ) @entity68 is one of just two goalkeepers to lift the @entity66 having captained @entity69 to their third crown in 1982			1
he was already 40 then , making him the oldest @entity66 - winning captain too			2
but the unflappable @entity68 's achievements do n't end there : he holds the record for the longest playing time without conceding in international tournaments ( 1,142 minutes ) set between 1972 and 1974			1
and with 112 caps , he ranks third in the @entity69 's all - time list			1
@entity81 ( @entity0 ) " what a save , " so the commentary runs to the finest piece of goalkeeping ever and one of football 's most memorable moments			2
@entity89 was certain he 'd scored after meeting @entity91 's center , heading powerfully down into the left - hand corner of the net in @entity95 's 1 - 0 1970 @entity66 group win over @entity0			2
but somehow @entity96 scrambled across , miraculously diving to push the ball up over the bar			2
banks might have been immortalized by that stop , but his absence through illness from @entity0 's subsequent quarter - final against @entity105 was perhaps more telling when his replacement @entity107 was made a scapegoat for the defending champions ' defeat			2
@entity111 ( @entity112 ) @entity111 will go down as sir @entity114 's best signing for @entity8 , certainly pound - for - pound			2
bought for just $ 750,000 in 1991 , the imposing @entity111 would provide @entity8 everything a world - class goalkeeper requires -- including the ability to launch a swift counter-attack			2
he won @entity120 92 with @entity112 and the @entity121 with @entity8 in 1999 , while 13 career goals are not to be sniffed at either			2
he played on a season too long , maybe , but on his day there were few better			0
@entity3 ( @entity124 ) at 38 , the rangy @entity3 is in the very twilight of his career -- but what a career it 's been			1
the man from @entity131 holds the record number of caps for @entity124 , he 's won the @entity134 twice and is on course to win a third @entity137 title in a row with @entity8 this season			1
all of which makes you wonder how come he spent so long at @entity143 ? united fans would love to have had @entity3 way before 2005 ; he has proved to be the definitive @entity111 replacement			1
@entity147 ( @entity148 ) it 's easy to take @entity147 ' brilliance for granted , but stand back and look at his career and it 's clear he 's already one of the greats			0
@entity153 have always been able to lure the best , yet they 've had the agile @entity147 as their number - one @entity154 since 1999 -- when he was still a teenager			0
still only 27 , @entity147 is contracted to the club until 2017			0
he 's already won two champions @entity156 and four @entity159 titles			0
at international level he came into his own during 2008 by captaining @entity148 to the @entity120 , becoming the first goalkeeper to do so			0
@entity164 's legacy is safe hands			0
@entity166 ( @entity167 ) @entity166 was a late starter in the position and famously had no official coaching			0
his international career spanned a record - breaking six @entity171 ( including qualifying campaigns ) across 22 years			1
by the time he came out of retirement to play for @entity167 at @entity174 , @entity166 was 41 and ended the tournament with 119 caps			1
he played more than 1,000 games , including crossing the bitter north @entity1 divide by playing for @entity179 and @entity180			0
the unflappable @entity166 ' enormous hands were his trademark and the curse of many an attacker			0
@entity185 ( @entity69 ) @entity185 vies with @entity147 and the @entity187 's @entity186 to be considered the best goalkeeper around at the moment , but in a country with a long tradition of high - quality @entity192 is up there with the very best			0
winning the 2006 @entity67 was the perfect riposte to his critics after @entity197 ' dramatic fall from grace owing to match - fixing			0
@entity185 , an imposing figure with no obvious weaknesses , stayed loyal to the @entity197 , who made him the world 's most expensive goalkeeper in 2001 when they paid @entity204 $ 46.2m for him			0
he 's been worth every cent			0
@entity206 ( @entity207 ) if there 's one thing a goalkeeper is not expected to do -- other than to make a mistake -- it 's score a goal			1
given @entity206 netted no fewer than 62 times in his career , including eight for his country , it seems only fair he should be included on this list			0
@entity95 's @entity219 may have outscored him and @entity220 of @entity221 might have out - done him on the chutzpah front , but @entity206 's pioneering free - kicks and penalties have made him a legend			0
@entity226 ( @entity227 ) goalkeepers are known for their longevity and ability to perform into their 40s			1
that makes @entity234 a relative youngster at just 36 , but the @entity235 holds the world record for the most number of international appearances			1
over a 16 - year career for the @entity241 country , @entity226 racked up a scarcely believable 181 caps			0
. having started his career playing handball , @entity226 went on to play in three @entity171 -- and was even on the receiving end of an 8 - 0 thumping by eventual finalists @entity105 at the 2002 tournament			0
@entity249 ( @entity250 ) this one is from the left - field and a little premature for a list containing the best goalkeepers of all time			1
but much is expected of @entity249 , @entity250 's up - and - coming talent			0
he 's already been linked with a move to @entity8 and he is on the radar of a number of @entity262 's top clubs			1
reliant on his amazing reflexes , @entity249 is one of the best shot - stoppers out there and great at on - the - spot improvised saves			0
@entity249 's already established in the @entity250 set - up and is already such a big star already that the @entity270 release of the @entity272 video game featured him on the front cover			0
definitely one to watch .			0
