we sometimes liken the presidential campaign to an extended job interview , but it 's certainly unlike any job any of us has ever applied for			0
you 've probably never gone into an interview where your prospective employer said , " your résumé looks good , but of course we 'll have to decide if we like your spouse , go through your tax returns , talk to your elementary school classmates , see how you react when crazy people ask you bizarre questions , and make sure the car you drive communicates the proper patriotism and ordinary - guy credibility			2
" it is n't enough to know whether a candidate can do the job well or whether his agenda accords with ours ; we need to gaze into the very depths of his soul			2
this question becomes particularly acute for candidates who seem awkward or unskilled at the glad - handing part of politics , the requirement to forge deep emotional connections with voters in the span of a few seconds			1
@entity32 is only the latest to struggle with " authenticity " ( as @entity34 and @entity35 did ) , and six months from election day voters and reporters are still trying to determine just what kind of person he is			1
so it no doubt caused panic in the @entity32 camp when the @entity43 published an account of @entity32 's high school years at the elite @entity47 school in suburban @entity48 , detailing the young man 's penchant for practical jokes and what he now calls " hijinks			1
" the worst was an incident involving a socially awkward boy , suspected of being gay , who had dyed his hair blond			2
" he ca n't look like that			2
just look at him ! " @entity32 told a friend , according to the @entity43			1
he then led a group that tracked the boy down , tackled him , and held him on the ground			2
as the boy cried and yelled for help , @entity32 reportedly clipped his hair with scissors			1
when he was questioned about the story , @entity32 gave what has now become the politicians ' standard response to the revelation of misbehavior from long ago : " i do n't recall the incident myself , but i 've seen the reports and i 'm not going to argue with that			1
there 's no question but that i did some stupid things when i was in high school and obviously if i hurt anyone by virtue of that , i would be very sorry for it and apologize for it			0
" you 'd hardly expect any politician in his position to say anything different			0
perhaps @entity32 is being completely sincere			1
but the @entity43 confirmed the story with five witnesses , four of whom described it on the record , so there seems little doubt about whether it occurred			0
they were deeply troubled by their participation in it , and recall it vividly to this day			2
news : @entity32 's ex-classmate : ' it was assault			1
' a candidate who has struggled with seeming human , as @entity32 has , could have done himself a favor by using this as an opportunity to show a little more of himself			1
he could have said : yes , it happened			0
it was stupid and cruel			0
i wish i could go back and undo it			0
but part of growing up is realizing where you failed when you were young , and learning from your mistakes so you can become a better person			0
most importantly , @entity32 could have said something that indicated he had a conception of how horrible the assault must have been for @entity120 , the victim			2
his only mention of @entity120 , who died in 2004 , was to say " i had no idea what that individual 's sexual orientation might be			0
" by referring to @entity120 as " that individual " he makes @entity120 a nameless figure , further distancing himself from the incident			0
which is exactly the opposite of what he should have done			0
after all , it 's the quality of empathy -- being able to see things from someone else 's perspective and feel what they feel -- that @entity32 has had trouble convincing voters he possesses			1
this problem comes up for @entity32 again and again , often in the form of " gaffes " that are usually taken out of context , but still reveal a tin ear for the lives people lead			1
to take just one example , when @entity32 said " i like being able to fire people that provide services to me , " anyone who has ever been laid off recoiled in shock , whatever the context			1
business owners and supervisors who have had to do the firing -- the humane ones , anyway -- know it can be a painful experience from the other side of the desk as well			0
it may be necessary at times , but you certainly would n't say you " like " it			0
perhaps @entity32 really does n't remember the assault on @entity120 nearly a half - century ago , despite the fact that so many of the other people who were there have never forgotten it			1
or perhaps he decided that claiming ignorance would be the safest course of crisis management			0
but what he said told people nothing about the man he is today and how he has changed and grown over that time			0
we 're all different people than we were in our youth , and we all have regrets			0
the 17 - year - old @entity32 may have been a privileged , entitled boy with a mean streak			1
the 65 - year - old @entity32 missed an opportunity to convince us he 's something different .			1

@entity184 : running for president means people will delve deep into your past
he says @entity32 likely *alarmed* by article alleging he *bullied* a boy when he was a teen
he says @entity32 said he did n't recall , expressed regret . for other boys there , it was vivid
@entity184 : @entity32 missed a chance to convince *skeptical* voters that he has empathy
