-- the case against @entity2 is grounded in his @entity4 backyard			1
there , in october 2009 , investigators unearthed remains of five of the 11 women -- ages 25 to 52 -- found on @entity2 's property			1
on monday , jury selection for @entity2 's trial begins in @entity13 , @entity14			1
@entity2 faces 85 counts related to his alleged rape , murder and dismembering of the women between 2007 and 2009 -- charges to which he 's pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity			1
since the bodies were discovered , other women have come forward alleging that @entity2 also attacked them			1
in april 2010 , prosecutors handed down an 10 - count indictment against @entity2 in connection with the alleged rape of a 34 - year - old woman in his @entity4 home			1
@entity2 's lawyers have declined previous requests by @entity0 to explain their case , and the suspect has not been interviewed			2
but in january 2010 , attorney @entity37 told @entity39 newspaper in @entity4 that he felt police violated @entity2 's miranda rights as he was being interrogated			1
but those likely to decide @entity2 's future have already had their first opportunity to take a measure of the man			2
about 200 prospective jurors were introduced to the accused serial killer friday morning at the @entity50 in @entity4 , county court administrator @entity47 said			1
they also met judge @entity52 , the presiding judge in the case , as well as the defense and prosecution teams			0
dressed in a polo shirt and khaki pants , and unencumbered by handcuffs or shackles ( even though he was escorted by six deputies ) , @entity2 addressed the jurors simply by saying , " hello			2
" @entity47 described the event as " unusual " but necessary to " ensure the integrity of the process in the interest of justice " -- though he did n't elaborate on how it did			0
following the meeting , the potential jurors went through an hour - long orientation and then were asked to fill out a 32 - page questionnaire			0
should they be tapped for the jury , they will sit through what @entity47 estimates will be a six - to - eight week trial documenting the gruesome case against @entity2			1
@entity2 grew up in @entity79 , joined the @entity80 at age 18 and traveled to @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , authorities said			1
people who interacted with him after his 2005 release from prison , where he had served 15 years for attempted rape , said he appeared to be " a normal guy , " known locally for selling scrap metal			2
his inconspicuous two - story home sits in a dilapidated neighborhood known as @entity93 , where one in five homes were in foreclosure and at least a third of residents got food stamps , according to a 2010 study by @entity101 's @entity100 and @entity102			0
neighbors and even a city councilman had failed to realize that the stench wafting in the area around @entity2 's home was human flesh , not a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory			1
moreover , the disappearance of the 11 women -- many of whom lived nearby -- went largely unnoticed for almost two years , with only four of them even being reported missing			1
many of his alleged victims struggled with drug addiction at some point in their lives , with court records showing that many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits			0
in late 2008 , @entity126 told police that a man in a gray hoodie offered her beer , and when she declined , punched her in the face several times			0
@entity132 said that he then tried to rape her , dragging her toward his home , adding that she got out only after " gouging his face			2
" police investigated @entity132 's complaint , with one police report noting blood droplets on @entity2 's walls and steps			2
but officers told @entity0 affiliate @entity143 that the case was dropped after @entity132 declined to press charges			0
after @entity132 's complaint , six more women would disappear			0
then , on september 23 , 2009 , a 36 - year - old @entity4 woman told police a story eerily similar to those of @entity132 and the woman whose 1989 account led to @entity2 's first conviction for attempted rape			1
she said he 'd invited her into his home for beer , punched her in the face , then began performing oral sex on her -- releasing her only after she promised to return the next day			2
more than a month later , police entered his house and found two bodies rotting in his attic			0
these were the first of the 11 bodies they 'd eventually discover , in various states of decay , on his property			0
most of the women whose remains were found in and around @entity2 's home were strangled by ligature -- which can include a string , cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand , officials said			1
seven still had ligatures wrapped around their necks			0
a skull is all that remains of one victim			0
it was found wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed in a bucket in the home 's basement			0
while the prosecution will press its case against @entity2 in the coming weeks , this may not be the end of his story -- even if he is eventually given a death sentence			0
@entity13 prosecutor @entity196 has said that his cold case unit is reviewing unsolved murders that occurred during the time @entity2 lived in @entity4 and @entity79 to see if there are any connections			1
@entity196 said the group is working its way through 75 cases			0
@entity205 's @entity204 and @entity0 's @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
