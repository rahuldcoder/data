-- do n't be surprised if @entity2 walks out of jail a free woman after her sentencing thursday , legal experts say			1
and , they add , there is nothing stopping her from cashing in on book or movie deals -- as her acquittal on serious charges now means she is free to profit off her story			1
with tuesday 's not guilty verdict on murder charges behind her , @entity18 -- and the thousands riveted by every twist in the case -- now turn their attention to thursday when the 25 - year - old will learn her fate			1
a jury on tuesday found @entity18 not guilty of first degree murder , aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter in the 2008 death of her daughter @entity2			1
but she still faces sentencing on four counts of lying to police regarding a missing person case			0
each misdemeanor count carries a maximum sentence of one year in county jail , for which judge @entity40 has the option of sentencing her consecutively or concurrently			0
many legal experts believe @entity18 will be freed on time - served because she has already been jailed for about three years			1
" i would be surprised if she does n't walk out of the courtroom thursday , " said @entity47 defense lawyer @entity46			1
" she has served so much time already			0
i do n't think the judge will make her serve any more time			1
the real question now is , what will she do next			0
" there will be no legal restrictions on @entity18 profiting on the details of this case , cashing in on deals for movies , books or interviews , analysts say			1
because of her acquittal , so - called @entity69 laws -- laws designed to keep criminals from earning money from their crimes -- do not apply , they say			2
" why ca n't she make money off of her story ? " said @entity73 , another defense lawyer			1
" you 've seen so many cases where witnesses for the prosecution have profited from the case			2
look at the @entity83 case and how the prosecutor , who lost the case , wrote books and made money afterwards			2
so why ca n't @entity88 do it ? " @entity91 's @entity90 , who has covered the @entity18 case extensively since @entity2 was reported missing , did not mince words about @entity18 's possible plans			1
" now tot mom finally has the beautiful life that she envisioned			0
she 's free , " @entity90 said on her show tuesday			2
" she will walk free as early as this thursday			1
she 's set up to make very likely over a million dollars off the murder of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity2			1
" the seven - week long trial ended with 11 hours of deliberation when an @entity104 , @entity105 , jury found @entity18 not guilty of the most serious charges			1
" this jury ignored the scientific evidence , " said @entity108 lawyer @entity107			0
" apparently , they found the only 12 people who still think the world is flat			0
" but @entity114 , who once represented @entity18 , said the evidence was n't there			1
" that prosecution overreached , " @entity114 said " @entity118			1
" " they used junk science			0
they attempted to overwhelm the lack of evidence with character assassination			0
they did not have evidence of a homicide			0
" the jurors in the case declined to speak to the media as did four alternate jurors			0
the fifth , @entity133 , told @entity0 he agreed with the verdict " wholeheartedly			0
" " the prosecution did not prove their case , " @entity133 said			0
" the big question that was not answered : how did @entity2 die ? " through the course of the trial , dozens lined outside the @entity142 courtoom to get a glance at the spectacle			1
the proceedings featured allegations of sexual abuse , questions regarding @entity18 's competence and various theories on what happened to @entity2			1
prosecutors alleged @entity18 used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious and then duct - taped her mouth and nose to suffocate her			1
they alleged that she put the child 's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it			0
@entity18 's defense attorneys maintained that @entity2 was not murdered at all			1
they said the child drowned in the @entity18 's above - ground pool on july 16 , and that @entity18 and her father , @entity167 , panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death			1
@entity18 's lawyer , @entity170 , also alleged that @entity18 's father sexually abused her from the age of 8 and she had been taught to conceal her pain			2
the upbringing explained some @entity18 's bizarre behavior during the time her daughter was missing , he argued			2
according to testimony , @entity18 was not looking frantically for her missing child as she later told police			2
instead , she moved out of her parents ' home and stayed with her then - boyfriend , @entity184			0
she also got a tattoo saying " @entity186 " -- @entity188 for " beautiful life " -- and went shopping , witnesses said			0
she also partied at @entity142 nightclubs and participated in a " hot body " contest at one point , according to testimony			0
@entity18 denied the molestation claim in testimony , saying , " i would never do anything like that to my daughter			2
" throughout the trial , the pain experienced by @entity18 's family was evident			2
both her father and mother sobbed on the stand at times recalling their granddaughter			0
@entity18 also cried as he testified about his january 2009 suicide attempt , which came shortly after @entity2 's remains were identified			1
at one point during the trial , @entity18 's mother , @entity211 , was seen mouthing the words " i love you " to her			2
after the verdict , the parents released a statement saying they wished to " move forward privately " and requested the media respect their privacy			0
" while the family may never know what has happened to @entity2 , they now have closure for this chapter of their life			2
they will now begin the long process of rebuilding their lives , " the parents said			0
if @entity18 is released thursday , it is unclear if she will be rebuilding her relationship with her parents			1
in session correspondent @entity235 said she asked @entity236 of @entity18 's defense team where @entity18 will go when she is free			1
" he told me it would not , with all seriousness , be back to her family home , " @entity238 recounted			0
" but , of course , anything is possible			0
