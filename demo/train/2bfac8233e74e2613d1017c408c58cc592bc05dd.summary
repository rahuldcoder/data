the " @entity8 360 Ëš " anchor wrote in an e-mail to the @entity11 's @entity10 that was posted online monday , saying that in a perfect world , no one would care about his sexuality , but he 's come to understand the " value in making clear where i stand			1
" " the fact is , i 'm gay , always have been , always will be , and i could n't be any more happy , comfortable with myself , and proud , " @entity6 wrote			1

" @entity45 ( @ @entity46 ) " thrilled @ @entity47 came out ! so , that 's why he never wanted to date me ! i would 've loved having @entity50 as my mother - in - law			1
" @entity52 ( @ @entity53 ) that did it ... ... now i really love @ andersoncooper			0

" @entity65 ( @ @entity66 ) " so proud of you @ andersoncooper			1
@entity69 have been , always will be			0
" @entity70 ( @ iamwandasykes ) " proud of you @ andersoncooper			1
" @entity74 ( @ leannrimes ) " @entity76 for being a brave , classy man			0
much respect ! " those sentiments were echoed on @entity0 monday , with many thanking @entity6 for being open and honest about his sexuality , hoping that it will give others the courage to do the same : macbil : " @entity83			1
there was a time not too long ago in this country when young men who realized they were gay had no role models			1
it took courage to do what you did			1
it would be hard to calculate the positive image you 've set for young gay men			1
" proud to be gay : " it took me 67 years to embrace myself as a gay man			1
i wish i had done it sooner , such as @entity83 has			0
thanks for making us proud , @entity83			2
" @entity103 @entity102 : " @entity105 anchor			2
puts himself in harm 's way more times than i can count			2
and his tailored suits are always great ! thanks for coming out , bud			0
let 's hope your colleagues over at @entity118 and other news orgs do the same			2
" @entity120 for putting another prominent face on our comunity			0
i ca n't amagine the weight that 's off your shoulders			2
" @entity128 : " i have to say i thank you @entity6 for your public announcement			1
bringing a face to the @entity134 community can only inspire the gay youth of the country to have someone to look up to			2
i am very proud of what you have done today			2
i wish you the best and happy life			0
you have always had me as a loyal viewer and shall continue my loyalty			0
" still others noted that his sexuality really does n't impact how they view the journalist : caninelady : " i liked him before ; i like him now			0
since i had no desire to marry him or have any kind of relationship with him , it does n't disappoint , upset or bother me			0
people should be allowed to live and love as they choose			0
there is way too much hate and judgment in society			0
i care only what people do with our life , what they contribute to society and not who they love			0
but , then i 'm just a 60 + , basically conservative old @entity165 grandmother			0
" and then there was the contingent who could n't believe this story counted as " news " : @entity171 : " what ? @entity172 's gay ? ! @entity174 , that 's old news ! i knew he was gay the first time i saw him in a tight fitting t - shirt reporting from the @entity179 years ago			1
he 's a good reporter and news anchor and the fact that he likes men , does not change my opinion of him			1
" but there was also an important discussion sparked by @entity6 's decision to share his e-mail to @entity10 with the world : why is it important for people to acknowledge their sexuality in the first place ? commenter @entity193 wrote the question this way : " i have wanted to ask this question for a long time : why do people who are gay or lesbian , etc. feel they have to announce it ? i have never heard a straight person do this			1
no one has a need to know ! " the responses , from fellow @entity0 commenters , were varied : @entity207 : " because people ask			0
when people stop caring enough to no longer ask because it does n't matter then gays will stop ' announcing it			0
" wcbhwk : " couple of good reasons			0
first , the more people who do this , especially prominent people in our society , the more others will understand that being gay is not that unusual			2
second , and more importantly , through our close mindedness and repression , both tacit and direct , we have forced many of those who are gay to live this aspect of their lives secretively			2
it takes courage to be openly gay , even today			1
while that is sad , it is still reality			0
so by showing courage to come out publicly , it sends a message to others to also have courage			2
" for his part , @entity6 tweeted on tuesday , " i appreciate all the nice tweets			1
i am in @entity239 working but want to wish everyone a great 4th of july ! " @entity0 's @entity241 contributed to this report .			0
