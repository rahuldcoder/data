-- in the three days since @entity1 crowned its 11th official princess and people got a glimpse of the " new " @entity5 -- @entity1 's doll version of the fire - haired heroine of the @entity10 - winning animated film " @entity11 " -- there 's been much uproar			1
the princess - ified @entity5 aimed at the merchandising market is hippier , her neckline a little more plunging and off - the - shoulder than it was in the film			1
and is that lipstick she 's wearing ? @entity1 was quickly taken to task by many , including the film 's writer and co-director @entity23 , who called the makeover a " blatantly sexist marketing move based on money " that strips the character of her place as a " better , stronger role model ... something of substance , not just a pretty face that waits around for romance			1
" the implication , of course , being that pretty girls ca n't be role models			1
let me be clear : as a female heroine , @entity5 was revolutionary , and we should have more like her			2
@entity1 's @entity44 -- the female warrior from its 1998 animated film -- was one , in fact			1
and indeed , in the film , @entity5 's best features were the ones that had nothing to do with her body , her face or her outfits			1
she was outspoken and unafraid , independent and empowered			0
she stood up for herself and others			0
she carried a bow and arrow , and she knew how to use it -- far more skillfully than the boys , besides			0
she was perfectly subversive as a princess for all the reasons that had nothing to do with her looks			2
( though let 's be honest : her wild mane of red hair could not have meant to be anything but ravishing			0
) at the same time , she was undeniably sexy , if you consider strong women sexy -- and do n't we ? dolls are built on the notion of fantasy			2
they are not true to life -- but even less true , by nature of their technical limitations , than cartoons , which benefit from animation that 's often so precise as to appear real			0
as toys , dolls take on many of the characteristics that the child playing with them chooses to impart			0
part of parenting is to help children explore the many options that life offers , to tap into the vast reaches of their imagination , but also to know the difference between what 's fiction and fantasy and what 's reality			1
and dolls , perhaps more than most toys for children , are not meant to be taken at face value			0
otherwise , we 'd be making the case for legions of 8 - year - olds to be running around suburban @entity108 with bows and arrows			0
and that 's not , i do n't think , the point @entity23 was trying to make in her movie			2
the reality is that in deciding to make some changes to @entity5 , @entity1 probably was thinking about money			1
how corporate @entity108 works is a conversation for another day			0
but more poignantly , moneymaking is how @entity1 , and others , help new films get made -- and yes , even the progressive ones			2
@entity1 's princess @entity5 does n't take away from the positive message that " @entity11 " put forth : lipstick or no , she 's still the same girl inside			1
but @entity23 's argument does -- by bringing the focus back to @entity5 's looks in a way that 's exclusionary of all else			1
the fact is that " babes " can be worthwhile role models , too , and no less so than those women whose looks are more rough and tumble			1
what 's sexist , polarizing -- and most damaging -- is the suggestion that women can be only one or the other : pretty or powerful			1
these are incorrect messages that serve to confuse and contain			0
instead , the message should be about how these days , women can be many things			0
girls -- and boys -- are listening			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			2

@entity147 : @entity1 *retooled* princess @entity5 from " @entity11 " movie as " babe " for doll
director 's *criticism* of " sexist marketing " implies pretty girls not role models , @entity147 says
she says dolls are for fantasy , and parents help kids use their imagination
@entity147 : calling new @entity5 sexist sends poor message
