-- in an @entity2 ravaged by the wrathful remnants of @entity4 in late august , 12 displaced families will break bread together at @entity6			1
" we are trying to rebuild , " said @entity7 , who with the help of his family will be cooking for at least 30 people thursday at the @entity11 , one of the few structures in the small town of @entity14 to survive the devastation of the storm and its enduring aftermath			1
@entity18 faced some of the worst and most extensive amount of flooding in @entity4 's fury , along with @entity23 and @entity24 , said @entity26 spokesman for the @entity27			1
over 7 million homes and businesses from @entity30 northward up the @entity31 lost power in the record - setting 10th billion - dollar disaster for the @entity34 this year , @entity26 said			0
@entity4 broke the previous record of nine billion - dollar disasters set in 2008			1
the estimated damage is more than $ 7.3 billion dollars total			0
" @entity38 is not the only threat -- inland flooding can be one of the deadliest hazards within a tropical storm , " @entity26 said			1
most of the families dining together thursday previously lived in one of the 15 now - unoccupied houses along @entity48 , where creek swelling and flood damage turned those structures into wrecked skeletons of homes that need rebuilding , or that have been condemned			2
the dinner invitation extends across @entity56 to neighboring towns including @entity58 and @entity59 , where countless homes and businesses also were destroyed			0
this was the first time a hurricane made landfall in the @entity66 since @entity67 struck @entity68 in 1985			0
@entity69 in 1991 came just shy of touching down east of the @entity68 's twin forks			0
what began as a category 1 hurricane in @entity30 had weakened into a tropical storm when it made a second landfall in @entity18 's @entity76 , and continued northward through @entity77 , @entity78 and then @entity24			0
" the @entity80 is prone to witnessing a tropical storm system , it 's not just @entity83 the @entity82 or ( the ) @entity84			0
if you live along ( the ) coastline east or south , you are susceptible , " @entity26 told @entity0			0
" @entity4 was a reminder of that , " he said			1
@entity6 dinner host @entity7 , an electrical contractor who lost his truck , tools , and customers to @entity4 , had been living in @entity56 with his wife and son for 16 years before the storm slashed through his tiny town			1
@entity4 demolished the first floor of his @entity14 home , drowned his foundation in creek backwash and waterlogged his floor with three feet of flooding that soon after became caked mud			1
having also directed the @entity106 for 16 years , @entity105 is grateful the ministry has let him and his family take solace on their grounds for the past two months			0
he hopes to be out during december , by the 15th or by @entity112			0
when he drives down @entity48 , @entity7 said , " it 's hard to comprehend how you are going to rebuild the town			1
" " when i leave at night , it 's sad to see none of the stores being open			0
i think for the most part we are on the mend ; i am worried about how many people are going to move back here			2
" some 20 mom - and - pop businesses , even the grocery store , were out of commission for weeks after @entity4 shredded the edges of nearby @entity129 , @entity124 spokesman @entity123 told @entity0			1
@entity131 , @entity56 administrator said , " there was complete devastation , the entire village , there was not a single building in the entire town that went unscathed			2
most were half knocked off ( their ) foundation , or worse , collapsed			0
" " there are still houses boarded up , probably just awaiting the wrecking ball , " said @entity131			0
@entity131 explained that the @entity143 has categorized most of the damaged structures as being in what are now deemed flood zones , and that banks are reluctant to finance rebuilding in these zones , for fear of future flooding			0
" the question is , can you literally pick up a home and move a quarter mile back to get it off the bank ? " @entity131 asked			2
from a municipal planning standpoint , he said , the reconstruction could take months			0
according to spokeswoman @entity158 , @entity143 has approved a total of more than $ 93 million in assistance to individuals affected by @entity4 , to date			1
@entity123 said @entity143 would be " rolling in houses " in about two weeks , with between 20 and 22 temporary homes arriving for @entity14 residents			1
he explained that in the meantime , displaced families have been staying with relatives and friends			2
" in these towns , the families go back generations on generations			2
there is always someone living close by			0
" slowly but surely , @entity123 said , businesses are beginning to show signs of life			2
" first the supermarket , then @entity182 's @entity181 , and @entity183 opened up the @entity185 last week , " he said , with the ring of small - town familiarity in his words			1
as it does every year , the town is working hard to finish projects before the winter			2
the asphalt contractors are closing up shop in time for @entity6 , and all roads left unpaved will be gravel through the winter months			1
they have already replaced six of the eight bridges lost in the flood with temporary structures that @entity131 anticipated will hold through spring			0
@entity7 told @entity0 he is impressed by how the people of the @entity14 community have come together			1
" that 's why we decided to stay up here , " he said			0
since day one , facing the aftermath of the devastating storm , family , friends and neighbors lent their hands and their shovels to clear the mud out of his family 's home			0
" we are coming back to life , little by little , " @entity7 said			1
on the more immediate topic of side dishes , table fixings and how to prepare a meal for 30 or more hungry mouths , @entity7 said , " well , we do n't know ! " " we are a big family and we are used to cooking for large groups			1
we are just grateful to give back to the community we love			2
" on the menu for @entity6 in @entity14 are turkey , corn , beans , potatoes , stuffing , yams , pies and cookies and -- @entity7 's brother 's favorite -- macaroni and cheese .			1

the small town of @entity14 in @entity2 was ravaged by @entity4
on thursday , residents -- many still displaced -- will *gather* for @entity6
" we are coming back to life , little by little , " says @entity14 resident @entity7
