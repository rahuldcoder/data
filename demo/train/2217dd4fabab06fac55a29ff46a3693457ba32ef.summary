sen. @entity0 , a @entity1 who hails from @entity3 coal country , tried to find some " middle ground " with @entity6 host @entity5 on climate change , saying friday night that he supports deregulating alternative sources of energy			1
" we need more energy , and maybe cleaner energy will supplant less clean energy over time -- and it already is -- but i do n't think that shutting down dramatically one form of energy is a good idea for an economy , " the first - term senator said on " @entity20			2
" @entity5 : i had drinks with @entity0 while saying he 's not against some regulations , such as on carbon emissions and clean water , @entity0 said he plans on introducing legislation " in the next month or so " that would cut regulation of alternative fuels			1
" i 'm for trying to get the government out of the way of converting your trucks from diesel to natural gas , or from gasoline to ethanol , " he said			0
" and try to let the marketplace take care of this , because some of these fuels are actually cheaper , too , and if they 're cheaper then people will go for a cheaper alternative that also is cleaner for the environment			2
" his comments come as @entity0 , who 's planning a presidential run but says he has n't made a final decision yet , has blasted president @entity48 and other @entity49 for supporting policies that would negatively affect the coal industry in his home state			1
he has also gone after the @entity53 for what he describes as overbearing regulations			0
and @entity0 blasted @entity56 this fall for arguing that climate change is one of the biggest threats facing the @entity60			2
on the show friday , @entity0 continued to argue that the rhetoric in the climate change debate can be exaggerated			1
" it gets so far out there , and it does almost get there with a religiosity that i do n't think we need to have , " he said			0
" if we 're going to say the @entity71 is drowning , that 's alarmist			0
" @entity5 , a liberal leaning independent who shares some of @entity0 's libertarian views , sounded encouraged by @entity0 's talk on alternative energy but challenged the senator on his point about the discussion surrounding climate change			1
joining the @entity80 - based program remotely from @entity81 , @entity0 also answered questions about the recent call to increase the number of troops in @entity86 to fight @entity87			0
" i 'm not for sending any troops into @entity86 , and will oppose sending any of our troops back into @entity86 , " he said			0
also on the program , @entity0 reiterated his position in favor of criminal justice reform for nonviolent drug convictions and vowed : " i will do everything to end war on drugs			1
" @entity6 , like @entity98 , is a division of @entity99 .			0
