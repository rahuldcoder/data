-- this week super fans from around the world are gathering in @entity3 to celebrate the 159th birthday of the legendary consulting detective @entity5			1
never mind that @entity5 is a fictional character			1
to this day , in books , tv and movies , sir @entity7 's creation remains just as popular as he was when he debuted in the late 19th century			2
much of @entity5 ' appeal has always been his amazing mind -- how he is able to solve a seemingly insurmountable mystery through simple observation and deep thought			1
would n't we all like to borrow from his bag of mental tricks ? just imagine the possibilities if you put @entity5 ' brain power to use in the workplace , the classroom or social situations			1
that 's the premise of @entity27 's fascinating new book , " mastermind : how to think like @entity5			1
" @entity27 , a columnist for @entity29 and a doctoral student in psychology , explores the latest science to dissect the inner workings of the iconic detective 's mind			1
in turn , @entity27 uses @entity5 as an example of how anyone can learn to think more clearly , improve his or her memory and generally increase everyday mental power			1
@entity0 recently spoke to @entity27 about the book and the benefits of learning to think like @entity5			1
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : how did you become a fan of @entity5 ? @entity27 : i was introduced to @entity5 by my @entity48 when i was young			1
we had a tradition every sunday night , he would read to us			2
different stories , different books			2
" @entity53 , " " @entity54 , " things kids would really enjoy			2
one sunday we started the @entity5 stories , and it was just a completely eye - opening experience			1
i remember sitting there riveted			2
it really stuck with me as i grew older			0
i realized how powerful they were from a literary standpoint			0
@entity7 was such a phenomenal writer			0
i do n't think people appreciate just how good the work really is			0
he 's masterful with voice , with conversation , with pacing , with description			0
he has it all down			0
i was also struck by how incredibly accurate his psychological observations were			0
@entity5 became this figure who predated modern psychology , neuroscience and our understanding of how the mind works by more than a century			1
combing through the stories , i thought it would be a fascinating way of looking at the mind by using this fictional character			1
@entity0 : can you briefly explain @entity5 ' thought process ? @entity27 : @entity5 is really a mindful detective , someone who knows the true value of observation , which means being mindful and in the present moment , really taking in your surroundings , really taking in everything			1
that type of approach permeates all of his thinking			0
he 's not just aware of his environment ; he 's aware of himself ; he 's aware of the contents of his own mind			2
he has a powerful knowledge of how he thinks , what mistakes he is likely to make			0
@entity5 puts it best when he says it 's the difference between seeing and observing			1
@entity0 : what is the " brain attic " @entity5 talks about ? @entity27 : it 's his analogy for how we store and process information			1
how is it that we take the world around us and we form it into the permanent memories that we will then use as the basis of future decisions , future thinking , of future knowledge			0
the reason he uses an attic is twofold			0
first , an attic is finite			0
you ca n't just keep stuffing things up there and expect it not to give			0
that 's true of the mind as well			2
the human mind is more expandable than an attic , but there is this finite capacity for working knowledge			2
which is @entity5 ' second point , and why the analogy works so well			1
it does n't just matter what you put up there ; it matters how you do it			0
so if you think about it like an attic in an old house , if there are just boxes everywhere filled with junk and none of them are labeled , you 're not going to be able to find anything			0
what @entity5 tells you is be careful , label everything , make sure everything is organized and accessible			1
that way , not only will you know where to find it , but you will remember it better			0
we really only know what we can remember at any given moment			0
it does n't matter if you memorized the information , and it 's in your attic somewhere			0
if you ca n't access it when you need it , you might as well not know it at all			0
@entity0 : are there everyday benefits of learning to think like @entity5 ? @entity27 : absolutely , this type of approach can make you healthier , happier and sharper			1
@entity0 : where would you start ? @entity27 : the first thing to do -- and this is difficult in our modern environment -- but realize that multitasking is not your friend			1
when you multitask , you can not think like @entity5			2
that 's just anathema to his mindful approach			0
if we take chunks out of the day where we focus , where we allow ourselves to just do one thing and nothing else , you 'll find your mind becomes better at doing that one thing and better at managing multiple inputs , filtering out distractions and creating a cleaner slate for you to work			2
when you 're cognitively busy , you 're not thinking as clearly			0
if you 're someone with a busy schedule who has to multitask all the time , even if you just practice this quiet mindfulness a few minutes a day , just let your mind focus on the present moment , it can make a huge difference in the clarity of your thinking			2
