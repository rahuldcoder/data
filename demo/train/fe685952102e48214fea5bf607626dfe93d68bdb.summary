the 37 - year - old , the world 's highest run - scorer in both limited - overs and test formats , hit 11 fours from 115 balls faced until he was finally caught by @entity7 captain @entity91 to be the first of two wickets for @entity94			1

when we batted we had to make sure we got a fighting total			0
i thought 310 or 315 would have been a good par score			0
then the ball started stopping and spinning and something closer to 270 was par.

at 102 - 2 the match was still in the balance , but spinner @entity120 dismissed @entity146 ( 30 ) and veteran batsman @entity147 ( 13 ) to turn the tide in @entity1 's favor			2
@entity150 tried to get @entity7 's run - rate back to the required level with a quickfire 29 off 24 balls , including two sixes , but when he was bowled by @entity156 it left his team needing 119 runs from 16.5 overs			1
@entity53 was the last man out , caught in the deep by @entity122 off @entity134 , but his runs came off a pedestrian 76 deliveries and he was not able to force the pace until @entity7 's victory bid became almost a lost cause			2
