-- @entity1 may be hoping to exorcise some demons when he returns to the scene of one of his career lows at this week 's @entity7 in @entity8			1
at last year 's tournament , the world no. 8 walked off the course in the middle of a dismal second round , blaming a sore wisdom tooth			1
@entity1 , who lost his number one ranking and took until december to win a tournament in a difficult 2013 season , described his @entity7 hiccup as the lowest point of the year			1
" probably the @entity7 back ( last ) february , " @entity1 told @entity21 , when asked for his low point			1
" i made a mistake walking off the course and disappointed not just myself			0
" @entity26 can be a frustrating game and emotionally tough			0
what 's important , though , is that i 've learned from that episode			2
i need to stay patient and play my way through the difficult patches			2
" the @entity33 golfer also switched to @entity35 clubs in a multimillion - dollar deal at the start of last season and found the transition from his former @entity41 equipment was n't quite as smooth as he would have liked			0
but he believes he has now quite literally got into the swing with his new equipment			0
" it would be fantastic to be 100 % comfortable with all 14 clubs at the same time , " @entity1 said			2
" it was worth taking the time to get it right			0
i 'm pretty settled with the kit , to be honest			0
" the tournament at the @entity51 course will unite seven of the world 's top - 10 players -- more than in any event of the season so far			1
it is also the first tournament of 2014 where the top three -- @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 -- have competed in the same field			0
however , @entity64 champion @entity63 had to drop out of the event at the last minute because of tendinitis in his right shoulder .			1

@entity1 says his @entity7 walk - off was low point of 2013
the world no. 8 says he 's learned to " stay patient " after what *happened*
@entity1 is one of seven top - 10 players competing in @entity8 event
@entity64 champion @entity63 has *pulled* out with a shoulder *injury*
