@entity0 -- the missile that brought down the plane carrying the president of @entity7 more than 17 years ago was fired from a camp controlled by his own ethnic group and not by @entity12 rebels , attorneys for the rebels said wednesday			1
the april 1994 crash of the plane near the capital , @entity16 , and the death of then - president @entity18 , a member of the @entity20 majority , was followed hours later by the start of mass killings			1
by the time they ended 100 days later , 800,000 people had died			1
most of the dead were members of the country 's @entity12 minority , who were killed by @entity20			1
the killing of @entity12 and moderate @entity20 by @entity20 militants ended when the @entity31 -- composed of @entity12 under the leadership of current president @entity33 -- halted the @entity20 militants			2
also on board the plane was then - @entity38 president @entity37			1
@entity37 was also a @entity20			2
a report on the plane attack -- written as part of a @entity43 judicial investigation -- has not been released publicly			0
however , officials said experts appointed by @entity43 judges @entity46 and @entity47 had identified @entity48 as the site from which the rocket was launched			0
the @entity52 camp at the time was controlled by " @entity20 extremists in the former @entity7 army and their @entity57 advisers , " said @entity58 and @entity59 , attorneys for the @entity31 , in a statement			1
" the responsibility of the @entity31 in the attack is therefore dismissed			0
" the experts and judges traveled to @entity7 in september 2010 to view the scene of the attack , the attorneys said			2
once there , they had the opportunity to conduct field surveys and simulations , and " they could also hear eyewitnesses who saw or heard the firing of missiles			0
" it is clear from their analysis that the probable location of firing was strictly inaccessible at the time to the men of the @entity31 , " @entity58 and @entity59 said			0
in 2006 , @entity43 judge @entity83 , who was previously in charge of the investigation , requested arrest warrants against nine @entity7 nationals belonging to the @entity31 , according to @entity58 and @entity59			2
seven people are still " under investigation , " they said , but they also accused the former judge of dismissing all evidence suggesting the @entity31 might not have been the perpetrators of the attack			0
the latest report , the attorneys noted , is a " turning point			0
" the @entity97 declined to comment on the report , saying it was part of a judicial investigation started because the crew members of the downed plane were @entity43			0
asked about the @entity7 opposition 's request for an international inquiry into the report , the ministry said @entity108 supports the @entity109 as a means to shed light on the @entity7 killings			1
@entity7 's government welcomed the report			2
" the crash served as an excuse for key perpetrators to execute a meticulously planned genocide against the @entity12 , " the government 's @entity115 said in a statement			0
the plane , which was struck as it prepared to land at @entity123 , was bringing @entity18 home from negotiations over the @entity127 peace accords , which had created a power - sharing government between rebels and the @entity7 government			1
" today 's findings constitute vindication for @entity7 's long - held position on the circumstances surrounding events of april 1994 , " said @entity131 , foreign minister and government spokeswoman , in the statement			1
" with this scientific truth , @entity139 and @entity47 have slammed shut the door on the 17 - year campaign to deny the genocide or blame its victims			0
it is now clear to all that the downing of the plane was a coup d'etat carried out by extremist @entity20 elements and their advisers who controlled @entity151			1
" @entity1 's @entity152 contributed to this report .			0

it *sparked* a wave of mass killings in @entity7 ; some 800,000 died
