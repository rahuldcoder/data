@entity0 -- the pilots of @entity4 did not fall asleep when they overflew their destination by more than 100 miles in october , the @entity2 said thursday in a detailed report on the wayward flight			1
the two pilots " became distracted by a conversation " about the airline 's new work schedule system and by laptop computers they were using in violation of company policy and did not communicate with air traffic control for about 1 hour and 17 minutes while they cruised past their @entity17 , @entity18 , destination at 37,000 feet , the @entity2 said			1
the safety board also faulted the @entity22 for air traffic control shortcomings			1
the @entity2 report gives the most complete official account to date of the errant flight , which prompted the @entity22 to revoke both pilots ' licenses , prompted the airline to suspend them from flying and prompted the @entity22 to adopt new procedures to notify the @entity32 military in cases where the @entity22 loses contact with commercial aircraft			2
according to the account , the flight from @entity37 , @entity38 , was routine until the plane was in the @entity40 , @entity41 , region			0
there , air traffic controllers directed the crew of the @entity45 320 to change their radio frequency			1
the co-pilot , or first officer , acknowledged the frequency change and read back the correct frequency			2
however , neither the captain nor the first officer contacted controllers on the new frequency until about 1 hour and 17 minutes later , when @entity56 , @entity57 , controllers directed the crew to contact @entity17			1
the @entity2 said that because of the proximity of the @entity56 frequency to the last frequency acknowledged by the pilots ( @entity56 is 132.125 megahertz , while the last frequency used was 132.17 ) it is " likely the first officer began to dial in the new frequency but never completed the frequency change by pushing an activation button			1
nor did the first officer attempt to contact the next controller			0
" the @entity2 said the frequency change likely occurred while the captain was taking a restroom break and while a flight attendant was serving dinner			1
" these events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next @entity79 controller , " the @entity2 said			1
further , the captain 's absence would have prevented him from checking the co-pilot 's actions			0
when the captain returned , the pilots became involved in a conversation over new scheduling procedures , and the first officer tutored the captain using their computers , the @entity2 said			1
" the pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention , " the board said			0
" both pilots state that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for @entity98			0
" the laptop computers they used likely blocked their view of numerous visual alerts , including text messages sent by airline dispatchers and at least nine messages regarding their position on the airplane 's primary flight display , the @entity2 said			2
@entity109 policy prohibited the use of the laptops , the @entity2 said			2
both pilots told the @entity2 the first indication of anything unusual was when a flight attendant called to ask about their arrival time			2
the captain " looked at his navigation display and saw @entity120 [ @entity18 ] to his left and @entity121 [ @entity122 ] to his right , " the board said			0
the @entity2 said it could not determine why the pilots did not respond to numerous radio calls , but said it could be because the volume was turned down , the pilots were distracted or the plane was outside the coverage for the 121.5 megahertz transmitters			1
the @entity2 faulted the @entity22 for not catching the pilots ' errors earlier , saying the plane entered two @entity40 sectors uneventfully , but radio contact was not established in the next two sectors , where controllers were preparing for a shift change			1
" neither sector controller 's relief briefing included information that communication had not been established " with the plane , the @entity2 said			2
the @entity2 said the @entity22 had no standard procedures to indicate that an aircraft had not made radio contact when electronic radar handoffs of planes occurred from one sector to the next			2
" because of this lack of standardization , @entity98 passed through two @entity79 sectors without the controllers being aware that it had not made radio contact , " the safety board said			0
almost 30 minutes had elapsed before the next sector 's controller attempted to regain contact with the plane and realized the plane was unresponsive to radio calls , the board said			0
recognizing the problem , controllers first attempted to regain contact by calling @entity4 dispatchers , then by calling an emergency frequency , but did not use words such as " emergency " or " mayday " that may have helped capture the pilots ' attention , the @entity2 said			1
the pilots did not respond			0
as a result of the investigation and of the crash of an executive jet in @entity183 in 2009 , the safety board is recommending steps to prevent a repeat of the incidents			0
six days after the event , the @entity22 revoked the licenses of capt. @entity189 and first officer @entity190 , saying their lack of awareness that they had overflown the @entity17 airport was " completely unacceptable " and " put your passengers and your crew in serious jeopardy			0
" but in a settlement signed with the pilots on monday , the pilots acknowledged no wrongdoing , and the @entity22 agreed to allow the pilots to reapply for their licenses in august , two months shorter than would ordinarily be allowed			0
a spokesman for @entity205 , which merged with @entity4 , said this week the airlines ' internal investigation is continuing .			0

first officer did *n't* completely load radio frequency , @entity2 says
he and pilot then were distracted by discussion , *personal* computers , @entity2 says
@entity2 also blames air traffic controllers for not realizing problem earlier
