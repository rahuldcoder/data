-- alright , here are the facts about @entity3 : @entity5 ' $ 250 million sequel is an utterly huge movie			1
it earned $ 64.1 million in its second weekend ( a 60 percent drop )			1
it has grossed $ 289.1 million after ten days			0
this total is less than the @entity11 had earned at the same point in its run ( $ 313.8 million ) , and that 's fine			1
this total is also less than the @entity16 had earned at the same point in its run ( $ 373.1 million ) , and that 's also fine			2
overseas , the film has already grossed $ 248.2 million , and its headed for a finish between $ 900 million and $ 1 billion worldwide			0
the reality is that it does n't matter if the conclusion to @entity24 's @entity23 trilogy beats any other film at the box office — @entity3 is a truly gigantic hit that will have the suits at the studio very , very happy			1
that said , the film is certainly performing below initial expectations			1
things looked rather dire on friday , when rises had to compete against the widely watched @entity35 opening ceremonies and earned $ 18.1 million — a whopping 76 percent drop from its first friday			0
but it stabilized nicely over the rest of the weekend			2
rises ticked up 44 percent on saturday to $ 25 million and is estimated to earn another $ 21.1 million today			0
altogether , that 's $ 64.1 million — good for a robust $ 14,549 per theater average — but a 60 percent drop from the film 's $ 160.9 million debut			2
that weekend drop indicates that @entity39 wo n't have the same legs as @entity11 , which ultimately found $ 533.3 million , so a domestic finish in the $ 450 million range seems likely			1
many who expected the film to earn @entity16 - sized numbers are pointing to the tragic @entity53 shooting as the main reason for the film 's lower - than - expected business , but at this point , i believe that word - of - mouth is a bigger factor			2
while the film scored an " a " cinemascore grade , critical reviews are not nearly as strong , and @entity63 is a less dynamic / marketable villain than @entity65 's @entity64			2
still , as i keep reiterating , @entity3 is an enormous hit			1
in second place , @entity68 's frozen animation @entity69 gathered $ 13.3 million in its third weekend , lifting its domestic total to $ 114.8 million — the lowest domestic total ever for an @entity69 movie after 17 days ( including the original , which had $ 116.9 million at the same point ) , though still quite strong			1
fortunately for @entity68 , the film has already grossed $ 511 million overseas , and it 's far from done with its run			2
@entity68 's other big release , @entity79 , debuted in third place with an awful $ 13 million			1
the $ 68 million r - rated comedy , which stars @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity84 , started off even lower than @entity86 's recent @entity85 , which grossed $ 13.5 million its opening weekend and $ 36.5 million overall			1
originally titled @entity79 , @entity68 was forced to change the film 's title and make a marketing about - face in february following the shooting of @entity94 by @entity96 neighborhood watch officer @entity95			1
suddenly , @entity68 brought the film 's alien invasion plotline to the surface ( something the studio was avoiding following @entity102 and @entity103 ) , but audiences never really got a clear picture of the film 's storyline			2
of course , terrible reviews did n't help , either , as @entity110 audiences have proven themselves rather savvy at avoiding poor comedies ( @entity79 , what to @entity112 , @entity114 ) and flocking to stronger ones ( @entity116 , @entity117 ) as of late			1
the audiences that did see @entity79 were 60 percent male and 59 percent 25 - years - old or older , according to @entity68			1
those patrons issued @entity79 a " c + " cinemascore grade			1
@entity122 , @entity123 's $ 33 million sequel , finished the weekend in fourth place with $ 11.8 million — by far the lowest for a step up movie			1
diminishing returns were expected , though			0
the original @entity127 , which starred @entity128 and @entity129 , opened with $ 20.7 million and earned $ 65.3 million in 2006			0
@entity130 debuted with $ 18.9 million and found $ 58 million total in 2008			0
@entity132 opened with $ 15.8 million and grossed $ 42.4 million in 2010			0
all three predecessors were produced by @entity134 and distributed by @entity135			0
the franchise has now changed hands to @entity123			0
despite the low debut , @entity139 , which earned a " b + " cinemascore grade , is n't a lost cause for @entity123			2
international grosses for @entity132 reached $ 116.9 million — a franchise high — and they may be the saving grace for @entity122 as well			0
( plus we all know that @entity127 movies will never really die			0
if direct - to - dvd @entity148 and bring it on titles are still getting made , there must be room on @entity154 shelves for low - budget @entity127 spinoffs , too			0
) rounding out the @entity157 was @entity159 's $ 50 million smash comedy @entity117 , which took in another $ 7.4 million , lifting its five - week total to $ 193.6 million and guaranteeing that it will pass the $ 200 million mark domestically very soon			0
@entity3 -- $ 64.1 million 2			1
ice age : @entity164 -- $ 13.3 million 3			0
@entity79 -- $ 13.0 million 4			1
@entity122 -- $ 11.8 million 5			0
