the @entity0 secretly collected two months of telephone records for reporters and editors at @entity4 , the news service disclosed monday in an outraged letter to attorney general @entity7			1
the records included calls from several @entity4 bureaus and the personal phone lines of several staffers , @entity4 president @entity8 wrote			1
@entity8 called the subpoenas a " massive and unprecedented intrusion " into its reporting			1
" these records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the @entity4 during a two - month period , provide a road map to @entity4 's newsgathering operations and disclose information about @entity4 's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know , " wrote @entity8 , the news agency 's ceo			1
the @entity4 reported that the government has not said why it wanted the records			1
but it noted that @entity34 officials have said they were probing how details of a foiled bomb plot that targeted a @entity34 - bound aircraft leaked in may 2012			0
the news agency said records from five reporters and an editor who worked on a story about the plot were among those collected , but it said none of the information the government has shared with it suggested agents listened in on any reporters ' calls			1
the news immediately raised questions among members of @entity54			0
" @entity58 is first for a reason , " said @entity55 , a spokesman for @entity57 speaker @entity56			1
" if the @entity62 administration is going after reporters ' phone records , they better have a damned good explanation			1
" the subpoenas were disclosed to the news agency on friday , @entity8 wrote			2
in all , federal agents collected records from more than 20 lines , including personal phones and @entity4 phone numbers in @entity73 ; @entity74 , @entity75 ; and @entity76 , he wrote			1
" we regard this action by the @entity0 as a serious interference with @entity4 's constitutional rights to gather and report the news , " he told @entity7			1
@entity8 demanded that the department return all records collected and destroy all copies			1
the @entity34 attorney 's office in @entity76 responded that federal investigators seek phone records from news outlets only after making " every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means			1
" it did not disclose the subject of the probe			0
" we must notify the media organization in advance unless doing so would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation , " it said			0
" because we value the freedom of the press , we are always careful and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws			0
" @entity113 legal analyst @entity112 said the @entity62 administration " has been incredibly aggressive " about prosecuting leakers , and there 's no privilege in federal law that allows reporters to protect their sources			1
but he said past administrations have avoided going that far			0
" i have never heard of a subpoena this broad , " @entity112 said			1
" it 's legal , as far as i can tell			2
the administration is n't violating the @entity58			0
but they are certainly doing more than has ever been done before in pursuing the private information of journalists			0
and we 'll see if there 's any political check on them , because there does n't appear to be any legal check on what they 're doing			2
" the @entity57 was unaware of the subpoenas , spokesman @entity136 told reporters monday night			2
" we are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal investigations , as those matters are handled independently by the @entity0 , " @entity136 said			0
@entity7 announced in june 2012 that he had assigned two @entity34 attorneys to lead investigations into the possible leaking of state secrets , and members of @entity54 have complained about disclosures of electronic warfare campaigns against @entity150 , @entity34 drone attacks overseas and @entity62 's personal involvement in " kill lists " of militants in @entity155 and @entity156			2
but @entity8 wrote that most of the records collected from the @entity4 " can have no plausible connection to any ongoing investigation , " and the @entity157 called on the @entity0 to explain its actions			1
" obtaining a broad range of telephone records in order to ferret out a government leaker is an unacceptable abuse of power , " @entity162 , the head of the @entity157 's speech , @entity164 , and @entity165 , said in a written statement			2
" @entity172 is a pillar of our democracy , and that freedom often depends on confidential communications between reporters and their sources			0
" in a statement issued monday night , @entity180 chairman @entity179 said , " i am very troubled by these allegations and want to hear the government 's explanation			2
" " the burden is always on the government when they go after private information -- especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources , " said @entity179 , @entity185			0
" i want to know more about this case , but on the face of it , i am concerned that the government may not have met that burden			0
" and rep. @entity197 , @entity198 , told @entity113 that the @entity0 already has the ability " to listen , very transparently , to all the government phones and government activities			0
" " you can imagine if @entity54 wanted to know about leaks that obviously came out of the administration that ended up in the press , they would be outraged if we tried to get that information , " said @entity197 , a member of the @entity202 and a leading critic of @entity7			0
" but that 's exactly what they 're doing			0
they 're looking at what is considered to be confidential			0

there *'d* better be a " damned good explanation " for subpoenas , @entity56 spokesman says
federal review of @entity4 phone records is unprecedented but looks legal , @entity112 says
the @entity4 calls the subpoenas a " massive and unprecedented intrusion "
it says federal agents collected records from bureau and personal phone lines
