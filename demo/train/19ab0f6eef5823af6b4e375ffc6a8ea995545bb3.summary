-- timekeeping in the @entity1 , which was already a pretty precise science involving lasers and atomic particles , just got even more exact			1
a new atomic clock , so accurate it will lose or gain only one second every 300 million years , was unveiled thursday by the @entity6 , a branch of the @entity1 @entity8			1
the @entity9 had been in development for about a decade and is three times more accurate than the @entity12 , which has been in use since 1999			1
the institute will continue operating both clocks for now at its campus in @entity17 , @entity18			0
the clock is used for civilian purposes in the @entity1 and its data is shared with the @entity22 in @entity23			1
the clocks work by using lasers to create a fountain of cesium atoms			0
" @entity30 " from those atoms as they move are counted to measure the exact length of a second			0
@entity33 , chief of @entity6 's time and frequency division , said the @entity9 was made more accurate by lowering the temperature of the area surrounding it			1
but why go to all this trouble ? most of us wo n't get fired for being a few trillionths of a second late for work , right ? well , no. but many of the systems we use in our high - tech world need to be a lot more precise			2
" modern telecommunication networks require synchronization to about a millionth of a second per day , " @entity33 said			0
" power grids also ... ( and ) gps systems require about 1 billionth of a second per day			2
" all of these technologies , and many more that we use every day , rely on exquisite timing and synchronization that is only possible with atomic clocks			0
" the @entity9 is expected to lose about one trillionth of a second per day			2
that 's way more accuracy than any of today 's technology needs and , hopefully , will be plenty for the next generation of innovation as well			0
" if we 've learned anything in the last 60 years of building atomic clocks , we 've learned that every time we build a better clock , somebody comes up with a use for it that you could n't have foreseen , " says physicist @entity68 , lead designer of @entity9			1
so , is the @entity9 as good as it gets ? not really			0
while it might be the most accurate atomic clock to use cesium , researchers say there are already clocks that use other atoms being tested and that those are even more precise			1
some of those divide time into units more than 100 times more accurate than even the brand - new @entity9 , @entity33 said			2
" i think all those clocks are going to be so good that we 're really going to have to change our perspective about what we mean by ' time ' , " he said .			0

new @entity1 atomic clock is unveiled thursday
the @entity9 will lose only one second every 300 million years
it 's three times more precise than last clock used in the @entity1
gps , telecommunications , other tech require high precision
