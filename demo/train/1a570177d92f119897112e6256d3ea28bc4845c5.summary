" they are @entity6 names for torture techniques that send chills through the hearts of @entity10 , particularly the untold thousands who are believed to have been detained during the uprising of the last 15 months			1
" we suffered torture all the time , " said @entity13 , an opposition activist from the port city of @entity15 who spent 40 days in solitary confinement in spring 2011			2
he told @entity1 he endured " dulab , " in which torturers force the prisoner 's legs and head into a car tire before beating them , and " basat @entity30 , " in which the prisoner is tied to a board and beaten			2
" they threw cold water on our naked bodies and they also urinated on us ... they are really good at what they do , " said @entity13 , who now is in @entity38 helping mobilize men and weapons to rebels inside @entity10			1
according to a report published tuesday by the @entity45 - based human rights organization @entity44 , the @entity10 government has been carrying out " a state policy of torture " as part of an effort to crush dissent throughout the unrest			1
@entity44 identified 27 detention centers across @entity10 where torture was systematically inflicted on prisoners , according to testimonies from more than 200 former prisoners and security officers who defected			1
rights group cites ' state policy of torture ' in @entity10 as stream of defectors reported " it is a network of torture chambers that the authorities are using to intimidate and punish people who dare to oppose the government , " said @entity62 , a @entity44 researcher			1
" nobody knows how many people are being detained , how many are being tortured , " he added			2
" but one local activist group has collected names of 25,000 people in detention			2
the numbers are absolutely staggering			2
" @entity44 titled its report " @entity77 " in an overt attempt to link the @entity10 prison system to the notorious @entity81 gulags described in @entity84 's @entity83 dissident novel " @entity85			1
" the system is being run by at least four intelligence agencies collectively referred to as mukhabarat , or secret police , the report says			2
those agencies include the @entity92 , the @entity93 , the @entity94 and the @entity95			2
" the authorities also established numerous temporary unofficial holding centers in places such as stadiums , military bases , schools and hospitals where the authorities rounded up and held people during massive detention campaigns before transporting them to branches of the intelligence agencies , " @entity44 reported			1
the @entity10 government routinely denies allegations of such abuses			1
recently , @entity10 's ambassador to the @entity112 walked out of a meeting of the @entity114 in protest after the @entity10 regime was accused of committing crimes against humanity			1
but the eyewitness accounts gathered by @entity44 as well as by @entity1 throughout the 15 - month crisis are overwhelming			1
though most of the torture victims in @entity44 's report were men ranging from 18 to 35 years of age , the organization also interviewed women , senior citizens and children who said they were tortured			1
" they electrocuted me on my stomach , with a prod			0
i fell unconscious , " said @entity132 , a 13 - year - old boy who told @entity44 he was detained in the town of @entity134 in may 2011			1
" when they interrogated me the second time , they beat me and electrocuted me again			0
@entity138 : @entity139 may not succeed in @entity10 " the third time , they had some pliers and they pulled out my toenail			1
they said , ' remember this saying , always keep it in mind : we take both kids and adults , and we killed them both			0
' i started to cry , and they returned me to the cell			0
" @entity1 has also interviewed more than a dozen @entity10 who described enduring beatings , electrocution and horribly crowded conditions in prison cells			1
a dentist who was arrested for secretly providing medical care to wounded demonstrators told @entity1 in february that he endured beatings , near - drownings in buckets of toilet water and electric shocks to his genitals during 45 days in a prison cell that was built for 60 people but held 130 prisoners			2
" they started beating me and asked me , ' who did you help ? ' " the dentist recounted			0
" i said , ' i helped an old lady			0
' then they started beating me even harder			0
" the accounts of brutality match those shared by a former mukhabarat officer who said he was repeatedly ordered to torture prisoners until he defected and fled to @entity38 with his family last year			1
" whatever we wanted the prisoner to say , he would say			0
not what he wanted to say , whatever we ordered him to say , " said the former officer , who spoke to @entity1 outside a refugee camp in @entity38 where he had been living for months			0
" we took their fingernails out with pliers and we made them eat them			0
we made them suck their own blood of the floor , " the officer added			0
photos : in @entity10 hospital , no escape from war the officer 's descriptions of the detention facility where he worked in @entity201 matched the descriptions of a former prisoner who had spent months incarcerated in the same building			1
that former prisoner 's finger was still mangled after it was crushed during a torture session in the @entity201 facility			2
the officer said prison guards used grim humor during their interrogation sessions			0
" we would bring the prisoner and put him in the ' basat @entity2 ' or the ' dulab ' and start beating him , " he said			0
" he would scream ' for @entity216 's sake , ' and we would say ok , bring the ' for @entity216 's sake ' stick			2
he would scream ' for my mother , please " or ' for [ the prophet ] @entity221			0
' and we would bring the ' my mother ' stick and the ' for @entity221 ' stick			0
every stick had a name			0
" " at the core , the crisis in @entity10 is about human rights violations , " said @entity62 , who has traveled into @entity10 to gather evidence and testimony for " @entity77			1
" " that is what is driving the crisis and driving people to take up arms			0
" the @entity44 report includes satellite maps showing the exact location of detention centers			1
it also lists the names of commanders of individual detention centers			0
@entity44 is urging the @entity244 to refer @entity10 officials to the @entity246 for alleged crimes against humanity			1
" those who commit these abuses do so with complete impunity , thinking they will never have to answer for this , " @entity62 said			0
" by publishing these names , we are really putting them on notice , saying they will have to answer for these violations			0
" @entity10 military defector : ' those who were injected are lucky ' journalist @entity262 contributed to this report .			1
