-- @entity1 holds a one - stroke lead going into the final round of the @entity4 at @entity5 's , @entity6 , as the @entity7 carded a one - under - par 69 to defy the wind and rain that plagued the early part of the day			1
the 42 - year - old , who has never won a major championship , is now just 18 holes away from breaking that duck , as he lies on a five - under - par total of 205 , one of just six players to be under par after three rounds			1
@entity1 , who is looking to go one better than his second place in the 1997 @entity4 , will be paired alongside @entity22 @entity21 on the final sunday , after the 27 - year - old from @entity24 posted a joint - best 68 for a 54 - hole total of 206 ( -4 )			1
numbers game : @entity4 stats you need to know @entity21 is also seeking his first major success , although he was deprived of a possible win in last year 's @entity31 when he was controversially penalised two shots in the final round for grounding his club in a bunker			2
the only other player to shoot under 70 was @entity22 @entity37 -- and the @entity39 star 's 68 was enough to put him joint third with veteran @entity40 on 208 , three strokes behind @entity1			1
@entity43 's @entity42 ( 72 ) and joint overnight leader @entity44 ( 73 ) are another stroke behind to complete the sextet who remain under par. @entity1 , who is bidding to become the third @entity7 to win a major tournament in just over a year , following the achievements of compatriots @entity52 and @entity53 , told the official @entity55 website : " from tee to green i ca n't really play any better than that			2
ugly and unforgiving : why @entity58 offers golf 's toughest test " i had one of those days where i had full control of my ball flight , although i did n't have the speed with my putting at all			0
but if somebody had said before the start i could have a 69 , i would have bitten their hand off			0
" the popular @entity1 was cheered loudly throughout his round and he commented on the support : " i think most of the crowd identify with a guy who 's not quite an athlete and likes a pint ! " i have a chance to realise a dream now and that would be fantastic			0
i have been fortunate to win @entity77 and world championships , but a major has so far eluded me , " he added			0
the third round began in terrible weather conditions , making low scoring practically impossible , although the wind and rain did ease up later in the day to make for a more benign atmosphere for the later starters			0
among those players whose chance of victory were swept away with the wind and rain were @entity92 ( 78 ) , @entity93 ( 76 ) , masters champion @entity94 ( 75 ) , defending champion @entity95 ( 74 ) and tournament favorite @entity53 ( 74 )			0
however , world number three @entity97 remains in touch on level par despite carding a three - over - par 73 , while former world @entity101 shot a superb 71 to also lie on level par.			1

@entity1 leads @entity4 by one shot after carding a one - under 69
@entity1 is ahead of @entity22 @entity21 ( 68 ) as just six players lie under par
@entity110 also carded a 68 and lies joint third with @entity40 @entity40
