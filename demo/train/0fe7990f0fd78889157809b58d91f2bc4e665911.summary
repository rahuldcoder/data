@entity0 -- supporters of a congressional resolution that would have declared the @entity6 - era killings of @entity8 " genocide " dropped their call for a vote on the measure thursday			1
secretary of state @entity12 said the resolution 's consequences on the war in @entity16 would be " quite dire			0
" the resolution spurred fierce criticism from @entity20 ally @entity19 , where officials acknowledge the killings of @entity8 during @entity23 but vehemently object to the designation " genocide			1
" @entity19 leaders threatened to curtail @entity28 access to bases vital to supporting the more than 160,000 @entity28 troops in @entity16 if the measure passed			2
the @entity33 administration , which is trying to persuade @entity19 not to launch cross-border raids against @entity36 rebels in @entity16 , had lobbied aggressively against the resolution as well			2
secretary of state @entity12 told a @entity39 committee thursday that the resolution 's consequences on the war in @entity16 would be " quite dire			1
" the @entity41 approved the resolution earlier this month			0
but rep. @entity43 , the no. 3 @entity44 in the @entity39 , conceded last week that " the votes are not there " for the resolution to clear the @entity48			2
in a letter to house speaker @entity52 , its major sponsors wrote that the measure would pass " if the timing is more favorable			0
" @entity52 , @entity55 , had promised to schedule a floor vote if the resolution made it out of committee , but told reporters thursday that she accepted the sponsors ' request to set the matter aside			1
though the sponsors , led by @entity55 democrat @entity66 , suggested the measure could be brought back later this year , a senior @entity64 leadership aide said the issue is off the table indefinitely			0
" this is not going to be taken up until next year at the earliest , " the aide said			0
historians estimate about 1.5 million @entity8 were killed by the @entity6 -- the predecessor of modern @entity19 -- during @entity23 but @entity19 , now a secular and democratic @entity75 nation , and masses of its people reject the term genocide , viewing the deaths as part of a war that claimed lives among all peoples in the region			1
@entity39 minority leader @entity85 , @entity86 , said the handling of the issue raises questions about the judgment of @entity64 leaders -- " a pattern that is undermining our national security			0
" " given @entity19 's importance in the war on terror , the role it plays in the care of our troops on the ground , and their close alliance with us in @entity20 , attempting to force a vote on this resolution in the first place was just plain reckless , " @entity85 said in a written statement after the news emerged			1

@entity39 speaker said thursday she accepts sponsors ' request to set vote aside
@entity116 would label @entity6 - era killings of @entity8 " genocide "
@entity120 said resolution would hurt relations with @entity19 , a *key* ally
