@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the @entity1 military on tuesday continued its relentless advance against protesters , citizens who had fled their homes for safety related " horror story upon horror story " to a reporter who managed to enter the country			1
despite the @entity1 government 's consistent refusal to give @entity2 and other international news organizations permission to enter the country , a @entity2 reporter crossed the @entity19 border into northwestern @entity1 for a few hours tuesday			1
she spoke to people at a makeshift campsite near @entity22 , where tarpaulins strung between trees provided the only shelter from the elements for the hundreds of @entity1 encamped there			1
one family said they had spent an entire night standing rather than lie in the mud			0
one man tried to protect himself from the rain with branches and a piece of tarpaulin			0
watch : misery at refugee camp in @entity1 families bathed in a muddy stream , where they also washed the few clothes they had brought with them			2
thousands of @entity1 head to @entity19 illness has already begun to spread , said @entity42 , a pharmacist who carried supplies with him as he fled , then set up something of a field hospital once he arrived at the camp			1
" my biggest problem is the children and people with heart disease , " he said			0
" i do n't have the medicine for that			0
" most of the refugees here are from the region that includes the nearby city of @entity58 , which government forces entered sunday			2
a number of people said they had witnessed bombings around the city as they fled			0
one man said soldiers shot at him , and a woman said she witnessed death			0
" they set our fields on fire , destroyed our homes , " said a woman who added that she was planning to try to cross into @entity19 for protection			1
but others said they would remain in @entity1 , some hoping to find loved ones lost in the chaos , others hoping against hope to return to their homes			1
@entity80 , 26 , said he tried to do just that a few days ago , but did n't succeed			0
" i was on my friend 's motorcycle and suddenly i saw the military advancing through the olive groves , " he said			0
" and they started shooting at me			0
" @entity58 is not the only town in the area that was occupied by the military			0
on sunday , the army also entered @entity90 and set up a presence in four areas of the town , an activist said			0
they arrived aboard tanks and pickup trucks carrying heavy weaponry , the activist said			0
but protests were continuing in defiance of the military , the activist said			0
since such protests started in @entity106 a month ago , four people have been killed and about 200 wounded , some of them seriously , the activist said			0
in addition , some 1,500 people have been arrested			0
but on tuesday , about 16 tanks were leaving @entity90 heading toward @entity111 , on the border with @entity113 , the activist said			0
residents of the tribal area have strong connections with tribes in eastern @entity113			0
as of monday , 6,817 @entity1 refugees had crossed into @entity19 , said @entity119 of the @entity121 office in @entity122			2
@entity123 said last week it believes more than 1,100 people -- including 82 children -- have been killed in @entity1 since the crackdown started in mid-march			2
as a result of such reports and the distribution on social media platforms of chilling videos depicting violence , @entity1 's government has drawn international condemnation -- albeit no response from the @entity136			1
" the @entity136 has failed , so far , to react on @entity1 , which i think is extraordinary and disappointing , " said @entity137 , a former @entity121 diplomat			1
the @entity138 has imposed sanctions on president @entity140 and other senior @entity1 officials because of human rights abuses , freezing any assets held in the country			1
the four @entity146 members of the @entity136 -- @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 -- have said the council must act			1
but ambassadors from @entity153 and @entity154 disagree , stating that @entity121 action would risk further destabilizing the key @entity157 nation			1
" @entity153 and @entity154 are concerned that if the @entity136 feels empowered to address the major human rights violations occurring around the world , eventually the @entity136 will focus on issues within @entity153 and in the neighborhood of @entity154 , " said @entity158 , executive vice president of the @entity159			1
" the failure of the @entity136 to act is a tragedy , " he said			1
some countries ' reluctance to act may be traceable to the @entity136 's resolution aimed at protecting civilians in @entity170			1
@entity154 and others quickly signed off on the resolution , but -- nearly three months later -- efforts by @entity175 forces appear caught in a stalemate			2
as for @entity58 , the @entity1 military seized control of the town over the weekend , a network of human rights activists said monday			1
the @entity1 government gave a similar assessment			1
" @entity186 units on monday restored security and tranquility to the city of @entity58 , " state - run news agency @entity184 reported			0
the @entity1 government insists it is stopping " armed terrorist groups " who carried out a " massacre " in the city ; opposition activists say the government 's claims are a ruse to justify a crackdown on demonstrators demanding government reform , in keeping with the wave of political protests across the @entity157 and @entity199 this year			1
throughout @entity1 's uprising , its government has described activist leaders as terrorists looking to destabilize the country			1
this month , the government said 120 members of the security forces had been killed by " armed groups " in @entity58			2
but @entity1 refugees who have fled to @entity19 said some @entity1 soldiers rebelled after being ordered to fire on unarmed protesters and instead started fighting among themselves			2
@entity1 opposition members , including human rights activist @entity217 , also said the deaths likely stemmed from a rift within security forces			2
because of the restrictions on journalists ' entry into @entity1 , @entity2 has been unable to independently confirm the accounts			2
@entity2 's @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
