@entity0 -- amid all the excitement and wall - to - wall media coverage about the eagerly - awaited new addition to the royal family , you may think you know all you could ever want to about royal babies			1
but did you know ... a government minister used to be present at royal births , to make sure the baby was not switched the practice is believed to have begun in 1688 , when dozens of officials watched @entity15 , wife of @entity16 , give birth to a son , to scotch rumors that @entity15 was not really pregnant and that the baby was to be smuggled into the room in a bedpan			1
the tradition continued well into the 20th century			0
the last royal birth to be witnessed by a government minister was that of @entity26 's cousin , princess @entity27 in 1936 , and the practice was only officially halted shortly before the birth of prince @entity30 in 1948			1
@entity32 husbands have not always attended the birth of their children @entity26 may not have had to contend with ministerial interference in her birth plan , but she also did n't have her husband there for support ; while she gave birth to @entity30 , prince @entity40 , the @entity40 was busy playing squash			2
prince @entity30 was on hand when @entity44 had prince @entity30 , but @entity30 himself may not be there for his own child 's birth -- expected any day now -- if he 's at work as a search - and - rescue pilot when the big moment arrives			1
if for any reason @entity30 ca n't get to the hospital on time , the @entity51 is reported to have asked her mother , @entity55 , to be there to support her			2
queen @entity57 was the first royal to use anesthesia in childbirth the long - reigning monarch and mother - of - nine was given chloroform for pain relief during the births of her eighth and ninth children , @entity66 ( born in 1853 ) and @entity67 ( born in 1857 )			1
her decision to opt for an anesthetic is credited with popularizing the use of painkillers during childbirth among the well - to - do of the time			0
@entity75 , the doctor who administered the drug , is better known as one of the founding fathers of epidemiology , after he traced a deadly outbreak of cholera to a @entity83 water pump			0

his brother was born at the same hospital two years later , and @entity30 's new son or daughter is also expected to come into the world there			2
while that might seem the normal way of things , in fact it was something of a break with tradition -- until then , all heirs to the throne had been born at home ( or at one of the royal family 's homes at least )			0
prince @entity30 was born at @entity110 ; @entity26 herself was born in the @entity113 home of her grandfather in 1926 -- though at the time she was not expected to become queen as her uncle , and not her father , was next in line to the throne			1
titled royal babies do not have surnames members of the royal family are famously burdened with plenty of names -- prince @entity30 was christened @entity126 , and his father is @entity30 -- but many ( those titled @entity129 ) do not have a surname			1
prince @entity30 and prince @entity131 have used " @entity138 " at school and during their military careers , but this comes from their father 's official title as @entity30			2
@entity30 and @entity51 may continue to use this for their new baby			0
as descendants of @entity26 and the @entity40 , they could also use @entity145 , or @entity146 -- both of which are relatively new inventions , adopted during @entity148 to disguise the family 's @entity150 origins			0
alternatively , the royal parents - to - be could even opt to found their own dynasty , using " @entity155 " as a surname			0
