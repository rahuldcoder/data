@entity0 -- two @entity5 fishing vessels came " dangerously close " to a @entity3 military ship in the @entity7 off the coast of @entity5 last week -- the fifth such incident in the past few months , two @entity3 officials told @entity1 tuesday			1
the @entity10 is an unarmed ocean surveillance ship operated by a civilian crew			0
the officials -- who could not be identified because the incident has not yet been formally announced -- said the two @entity5 boats approached the @entity10 , a military sealift command ship , in international waters friday in the @entity7 , which lies between @entity5 and @entity17			1
over a period of several hours , the officials said , the @entity5 vessels repeatedly came close to the @entity10 in what was described as deliberate maneuvers -- once coming within 30 yards of the @entity3 vessel			1
both officials said the @entity5 vessels came to a dead halt in front of the @entity10 at one point , in heavy fog , causing the @entity3 ship to have to come to a dangerous sudden stop			1
the officials did not know the exact size of the @entity5 ships but described them as being smaller than the 235 - foot long @entity3 vessel			2
the crew of the @entity10 turned its fire hoses on to keep the @entity5 ships away but did not directly spray them at the smaller boats , one official said			2
the @entity10 also sounded its danger alarm system and radioed for assistance to a larger @entity5 fisheries service vessel nearby			0
that vessel did shine a light on the small @entity5 vessels but took no further action , the official said			0
the @entity10 is an unarmed ocean surveillance ship operated by a civilian mariner crew working for the @entity47			0
the mission is to conduct authorized undersea listening operations in international waters , according to the @entity51			1
there is video of this latest incident , but it has not been released by the @entity55			0
the @entity10 was involved in another incident with a @entity5 ship on march 4 in the @entity7 , when a @entity5 @entity58 used a spotlight to illuminate the @entity10 and crossed the @entity3 vessel 's bow " at a range of about 1,400 yards in darkness without notice or warning , " according to a @entity55 statement			1
the following day , a @entity5 y - 12 maritime surveillance aircraft conducted 12 fly - bys of the @entity10 at an altitude of about 400 feet and a range of 500 yards , the @entity55 said			0
on march 6 , a @entity5 frigate approached the @entity72 , another @entity3 ocean surveillance ship , " and proceeded to cross its bow at a range of approximately 100 yards , " the @entity55 said			1
two hours later , a @entity5 y - 12 aircraft conducted 11 fly - bys of the @entity72 at an altitude of 600 feet and a range from 100 - 300 feet , the statement said			0
two days later , five @entity5 ships surrounded and harassed the @entity72 in the @entity82			0
the crew of the @entity72 turned its fire hoses on the @entity5 boats , which also moved in front of the @entity3 vessel and dropped pieces of wood in the water			1
the @entity3 protested the actions to @entity92 as " unprofessional			0
" last week 's incident came soon after @entity3 chief of naval operations adm. @entity94 returned from a visit to @entity5 last month			2
he was there to discuss the safety of @entity3 and @entity5 maritime operations			2
after the @entity72 incidents , the @entity51 provided armed warships to escort some @entity10 ships in the region , but as one of the officials said , " it 's international waters , we should not have to do that			1
" the @entity5 claim much of those waters as an economic zone over which they have sole authority .			0
