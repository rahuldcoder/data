@entity1 's hopes of finding asylum from @entity4 prosecution on espionage charges appeared to dim tuesday as country after country denied his request or said he would have to find a way to travel to their territory to apply			1
while @entity16 and @entity17 seemed supportive , 11 of the 21 countries he 's applied to , including @entity14 and @entity15 , have said they ca n't consider his request until he shows up at one of their embassies or on their borders			1
three -- @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 -- have denied the request outright			0
and @entity16 said tuesday the plane carrying its president , @entity28 , was denied permission to land for refueling in either @entity31 or @entity32 because of " unfounded " rumors that @entity1 was aboard			1
foreign minister @entity34 told @entity16 television that the jet made an emergency landing in the @entity39 capital of @entity40 and that @entity16 wanted an explanation from @entity42 and @entity43			1
" we do n't know who has come up with this huge lie , " @entity34 said , adding , " we would like to let the international community know that the rights of aerial traffic for @entity16 have been violated			1
" @entity50 had been in @entity51 , where he told the @entity54 news network that he would be willing to consider asylum for @entity1			2
and @entity17 president @entity56 , also in @entity57 for a tribute to his late predecessor , @entity59 , said @entity1 deserves protection , not prosecution			1
' @entity62 seeks new havens @entity56 said @entity1 's decision to leak details of @entity67 surveillance programs were " a warning signal to the world , " according to statement from the president 's office			1
" he 's now being persecuted and you have to wonder , why is he being persecuted ? " @entity56 asked			0
" how many missiles has @entity1 launched against innocent peoples around the world ? has @entity1 planted bombs that killed ( people ) ... what crimes has he committed against humanity ? " but as of tuesday evening , it did not appear that either country had made a firm offer of asylum , or any way for him to leave @entity57 's @entity86			1
@entity1 had already withdrawn his asylum request with @entity51 authorities after president @entity89 said he would have to " stop his work aimed at harming our @entity67 partners " if he wanted to stay in the country			1
that appeared to leave him in much the same pickle he 's been in since he left @entity97 last month for @entity57			1
@entity51 authorities say he remains in the airport transit area -- technically a free man , but unable to travel after the @entity4 revoked his passport			2
neither @entity101 nor @entity1 has commented on the rejections			2
the group released a statement attributed to @entity1 late monday in which he blasted the @entity106 administration for trying to block his efforts to seek refuge			1
" these are the old , bad tools of political aggression , " @entity1 said			2
" their purpose is to frighten , not me , but those who would come after me			0
" but he added , " i am unbowed in my convictions and impressed at the efforts taken by so many			0
" in monday 's statement , @entity1 criticized the @entity106 administration for yanking his passport once criminal charges were filed , " leaving me a stateless person			1
" but he said the administration is n't afraid of people like him or others accused of disclosing @entity4 secrets			0
" no , the @entity106 administration is afraid of you , " he said			0
" it is afraid of an informed , angry public demanding the constitutional government it was promised -- and it should be			0
" the @entity4 has been pressing countries to refuse @entity1 entry and hand him over to face espionage charges			2
his disclosures about widespread @entity4 surveillance of telephones and internet users in the @entity4 and abroad -- based largely on documents he has acknowledged taking while an @entity138 contractor in @entity139 -- have created a political storm at home and diplomatic headaches overseas for president @entity106			1
opinion : @entity4 intelligence community is out of control on monday , @entity106 had to defend @entity4 intelligence practices after fresh reports about alleged @entity4 surveillance of @entity150 offices in the @entity4 and @entity151 , as well as surveillance at diplomatic facilities in the @entity4			0
the @entity155 news magazine @entity154 reported sunday that information from @entity1 detailed @entity138 bugging of @entity159 offices in @entity160 and @entity161 , as well as an " electronic eavesdropping operation " that tapped into an @entity159 building in @entity164 , @entity165			1
the reports generated a furor among @entity151 leaders , who demanded the @entity4 come clean about the surveillance			0
some , including @entity31 president @entity169 , said ending any such surveillance would be necessary before @entity151 leaders would be willing to start negotiations on a trans - @entity173 free trade agreement championed by @entity106			0
asked at a news conference in @entity175 about the latest leaks involving @entity1 , @entity106 said he needed more information on the specific programs cited in the @entity154 report , but made clear such spying was commonplace			2
" i guarantee you that in @entity151 capitals , there are people who are interested in , if not what i had for breakfast , at least what my talking points might be should i end up meeting with their leaders , " @entity106 said			0
" that is how intelligence services operate			0
" asylum applications in addition to @entity1 's earlier applications to @entity14 , @entity51 and @entity15 , @entity101 on sunday submitted applications to 18 countries on @entity1 's behalf : @entity39 , @entity16 , @entity23 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity31 , @entity155 , @entity24 , @entity200 , @entity201 , the @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity25 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity17			1
the organization said that the documents it had submitted for the latest asylum requests " outline the risks of persecution mr. @entity1 faces in the @entity4			1
" @entity14 president @entity212 told the @entity214 newspaper @entity213 that the @entity67 fugitive would have to reach @entity14 territory for his request to be considered			0
" are we responsible for getting him to @entity14 ? it 's not logical , " he told @entity213 , one of the recipients of @entity1 's leaks			1
" the country that has to give him a safe conduct document is @entity51			0
" he added that the decision to issue @entity1 temporary travel documents that allowed him to leave @entity97 was " a mistake on our part , " @entity213 reported			1
over the weekend , @entity212 said vice president @entity229 asked @entity14 to reject @entity1 's request			1
@entity106 said monday that @entity1 had traveled to @entity51 without a valid passport or legal papers and that he hoped that @entity57 would handle the case as it would any other travel - related matter			1
here 's a rundown of what countries are saying about @entity1 's asylum requests : @entity39 : his request is not valid , because applicants must be in @entity39 and submit their applications in person			1
