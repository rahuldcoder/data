@entity0 -- as the global travel industry rolls out the welcome mat for @entity6 's surge of outbound tourists , it should consider tipping the scales in their customers ' favor			1
consider @entity11 , which has won over retail - crazy @entity6 travelers by simply boosting their baggage allowance			0
" they increased their luggage allowance because they recognized when @entity6 travelers go abroad , they come home with more than when they left , " says @entity14 , @entity16 - @entity15 president of @entity17			0
" and just by making that change , they won tremendous market share of the @entity6 consumer			0
" for the latest @entity1 " @entity30 " program , i talked to a panel of industry insiders about how to cater to @entity6 's rush of outbound tourists			1
fittingly , we filmed our discussion inside @entity37 -- a rare opportunity for an international tv network			0
the airport is on track to become the world 's busiest passenger hub			0
that 's not a surprise , given the boom in @entity6 business and leisure travel			1
by 2020 , it 's estimated more than 200 million @entity6 will go overseas -- double the number that did so last year			1
" it has been one of the biggest dreams for @entity6 travelers to go outside and travel overseas , " says @entity51 , a @entity0 - based researcher at the @entity52 , a government think - tank that studies tourism trends			1
" and now the government has lifted restrictions on outbound travel , so for more @entity6 , it 's much easier to travel abroad			1
" fueled by more visas and more money , rising numbers of @entity6 tourists are now able to fly further and spend more , many booking their own adventures online on travel sites like @entity6 's @entity64			1
" we just recently sold a very top - end package tour which is $ 200,000 per person for 88 days around the world , " says @entity64 chief operating officer @entity67 she asks me to guess how long it took to sell the package			0
i play along : " eight minutes ? " " 17 seconds , " she says with a smile			0
without a doubt , the interest and buying power of @entity6 's ultra-luxury travelers is immense			1
across the board , @entity6 's outbound tourists are the world 's biggest spenders			1
in 2012 , they spent a record $ 102 billion on international tourism			0
and major booking volume is moving across mobile devices			0
" more than 50 % of our hotel bookings are on mobile , " says @entity64 's @entity86 @entity17 's @entity14 adds : " @entity6 skipped the whole desktop / macbook / computer thing and went straight to mobile			2
" " some companies are really proud to have a new website , but if it does n't have the functionality to be read on a small device and have full integration on a mobile device , it 's really of no use			0
" it 's also of no use if you do n't welcome your @entity6 guests in @entity105			2
" we do this outbound @entity6 travelers survey every quarter , " says @entity52 's @entity51			2
" and we noticed that last year , for four consecutive seasons , lacking @entity6 service and lacking @entity6 - language tv programs or menus were the most unsatisfying factors			0
" " as a business , you probably have to provide more @entity6 - language services , " he adds			2
@entity64 company data is in line with @entity52 's quarterly surveys			0
" on our website , we rank the hotels and the sites , " says @entity86 " the hotels with @entity6 services are ranked higher than the other hotels			1
" and does that influence consumer choice ? " absolutely			0
" in 2011 , @entity126 launched " @entity127 , " a welcome program tailored for @entity6 travelers			2
in a number of @entity17 properties outside @entity6 , it rolled out @entity134 terminals , front desk staff fluent in @entity6 , and a range of tailored in - room amenities like @entity138 and tea kettles			0
" we started the program in august 2011 with 15 participating hotels outside of @entity6 , " @entity14 tells me			1
" we now have 82 , and those hotels doubled their percentage of @entity6 travelers in a period of just two years			2
" it 's a clear message for the global travel industry : tune those screens to @entity6 tv and boost that baggage allowance			1
it pays to understand the needs of the 200 million tourists coming your way .			1
