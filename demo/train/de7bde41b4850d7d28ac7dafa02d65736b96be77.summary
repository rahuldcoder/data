@entity43 is expected to travel to @entity54 for meetings with senior @entity68 officials , the statement said , and then to @entity8 to attend @entity11 's independence ceremony			1

" this cycle will continue to be played out with increasingly destructive results for @entity68 civilians until the international community stiffens its spine and imposes swift and severe repercussions for the endless cycle of violence the @entity54 regime continues to fuel			2
" the @entity77 combines satellite imagery analysis and field reports with mapping technology in hopes of deterring the resumption of the bloody and bitter civil war north and south fought for decades			1
