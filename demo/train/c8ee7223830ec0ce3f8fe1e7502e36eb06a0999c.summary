middle - distance runner @entity0 carried the @entity2 flag last month in opening ceremonies for the @entity4 in @entity5			1
that was quite a change for the powerhouse runner , who three years ago was scrutinized for issues other than her athletic performance before being cleared to compete			0
@entity0 gained attention in 2009 before the @entity11 in @entity12 -- not for her athletic prowess , but because some questioned the then - 18 - year - old 's gender			1
her masculine appearance had raised concerns and complaints to the @entity19 , the governing body for all international athletic competitions outside the @entity21			0
before the @entity11 began , the @entity19 confirmed @entity0 was being tested for gender verification			1
the concept of gender testing for athletes is not new			1
various methods have been used to assure that men do not compete as women , which would give them an unfair athletic advantage			2
while both men and women produce testosterone in their bodies , in men it produces more muscle , adding to athletic prowess			0
women use testosterone to produce estrogen , the female hormone			0
this year , the @entity41 instituted a new testing policy that measures testosterone levels of female athletes , rather than @entity45			1
the testing is performed only if questions are raised about a female athlete 's performance , and must be requested by a chief medical officer of a national olympic committee or a member of the @entity54 's medical commission			1
while @entity0 won the gold medal in the women 's 800 - meter in 2009 , the win was overshadowed by the gender questions , and her competitors complained she should not have been allowed to compete			1
on september 11 , 2009 , @entity61 's @entity60 reported information from " a source closely involved with the @entity0 examinations @entity19 testing , " which revealed that she had both male and female sexual characteristics			1
@entity0 had no womb or ovaries , according to the report , and had undescended testes , causing her to have triple the levels of testosterone of other female athletes			1
@entity75 athlete under pressure to prove her gender after accusations while the politically incorrect term for people who possess both male and female sexual characteristics is hermaphrodite , the proper term is " intersex			2
" the @entity19 advised @entity0 to get surgery because of the potential health issues caused by her condition			1
no public information was provided about her treatment			0
in july 2010 , the @entity19 cleared @entity0 to compete			1
she took second place in her @entity21 debut wednesday in the 800 - meter heats			0
commentary : my life as a ' mighty hermaphrodite ' gender testing has been the subject of debate , and different testing methods -- hair patterns , chromosome testing , individual gene testing -- have been used , but no method is perfect			1
" there 's no simple test to determine gender , so what we 're left with is an imperfect system , " says dr. @entity103 , a @entity104 medical geneticist who served as a medical adviser to the @entity54 on its new policy for testing female athletes for " hyperandrogenism " -- meaning producing too many male hormones			1
critics of the female " hyperandrogenism " testing include professors @entity120 and @entity122 of @entity123 and @entity124 , respectively			2
the two say the " new sex testing policy threatens to ban women whose bodies produce high levels of testosterone			1
" they argue in an editorial published in the @entity132 that " faulty logic ... links two common but inaccurate assertions about testosterone			0
" " the first is that male and female elite athletes have clear and distinct testosterone levels			2
... the @entity54 then projects this supposed gap onto differences in male and female athletic performance , claiming they ' differ mainly due to the fact that men produce significantly more androgenic hormones than women			0
' " @entity103 disagrees , saying that " there 's a huge @entity146 " between male and female testosterone levels			0
he also suggests " there could be no testing , which has been argued , " by @entity150 and @entity122 , " but the vast majority of female athletes i have spoken with believe there should be some sort of testing " when questions are raised about female athletes			2
transsexual athletes treated unfairly the @entity54 regulations state that " the performance of male and female athletes may differ mainly due to the fact that men produce significantly more androgenic hormones than women and , therefore , are under stronger influence of such hormones			0
" women who are found to have abnormally high levels of androgens may have an unfair advantage , according to the regulations			0
the @entity54 also notes , " nothing in these regulations is intended to make any determination of sex			0
instead these regulations are designed to identify circumstances in which a particular athlete will not be eligible ( by reason of hormonal characteristics ) to participate in the @entity4 " in the female category			0
@entity103 says he believes it would be " extraordinarily difficult " for women to reach the male range threshold for testosterone , which is not spelled out by the @entity54 because of differing lab testing methods			2
he says that for the small number of female athletes who learn they have high levels of testosterone , treating the condition , whether it is caused by a disorder of sex development or an adrenal malfunction , will benefit their health			0
@entity75 athlete makes plea for @entity0			2
