-- i never had the chance to meet @entity3			1
but she has been in my life all along			2
in some of my darkest moments , her prose was a lit candle			1
when i felt alone , her words were my company			1
the times when i saw the glass ceiling hovering over my career , suffocating my joy , turning my hard - fought acceptance of my truth into a self - loathing cage from which i saw no escape , @entity3 came to me and said she knew why i sing			1
as much as she is known as a great defender of women 's rights and lyrical curator of the black experience , i found so many of her words transcended the plight of any one particular group			1
she was so adept at linking us all through the human condition			0
i know i 'll never be as good a writer as she was			0
but it 's because of the effect her gift continues to have on me that i continue to try			1
i never had the chance to meet @entity3			1
but her poem " @entity34 " found me			1
frozen in my seat decades ago when a well - meaning @entity36 teacher asked me to read a few stanzas out loud			0
a teenage boy is not supposed to say such things			0
a closeted teenage boy may be found out			2
filled with anxiety , i abruptly refused and after a look , the teacher moved on , picking another student			0
food , friends and freedom : @entity50 remembers @entity3 but @entity3 stayed right there with me			1
" @entity34 " stayed right there with me			0
the images of the words resting in the recesses of my mind , until saying " i 'm a woman / phenomenally			2
/ phenomenal woman , / that 's me " no longer threatened to define or paralyze me			2
instead , when i finally had the courage , i found her words liberated me from the arbitrary rules of gender normality and my own internalized homophobia			1
i do n't think i 've ever shared that story with anyone before			0
even as i was writing that passage , i was acutely aware that some readers will mock me for this disclosure			0
and it 's because of @entity3 that i smile at this prospect			1
" you have no idea who you will inform because all of us are caged birds , have been and will be again , " she said in 1998 at a fundraiser for the @entity75			0
" caged by somebody else 's ignorance			2
caged because of someone else 's small - mindedness			2
caged because of someone else 's fear , hate and sometimes , caged by our own lack of courage			2
" @entity3 remembered by those she inspired an article in @entity92 , written about her 80th birthday , touched on her rape at 7 by her mother 's boyfriend			1
he was later murdered by her uncles			0
she stopped talking to anyone but her brothers for five years because she felt responsible for his death			0
she told the newspaper what her grandmother said about her silence : " ' sister ' -- she called me sister -- ' @entity107 do n't care what other people say about you			0
momma knows when you and the @entity112 are ready , you goin ' to be a teacher			0
' " the financial despair of newspapers , the decline of the neighborhood bookstore , the drop in book sales all suggest that the written word has lost its value			1
while it is true that electronic media have changed the vessel , that should never be mistaken for a decline in the value of the cargo it carries			2
whether it be on a page of a magazine , a handwritten note or an e-mail , the power of the written word is still an inescapable force that can wound or heal			1
@entity3 : some of her most powerful speeches consider the last thing @entity3 wrote : " listen to yourself and in that quietude you might hear the voice of @entity142 " -- a tweet that is every bit as clear as any line found from her 1971 collection , " @entity147 of @entity149 ' fore i die			1
" i never had the chance to meet @entity3			1
but when i needed encouragement , she came to me			0
in poems and in the songs of her album " @entity156			0
" she came to me through the familiar smell of aged paper that erupts from a book that has n't been opened in quite a long time			0
she came to me when i met a subtle , homophobic slight at the office with a smile and knowing look that said , " you may write me down in history / with your bitter , twisted lies , / you may trod me in the very dirt / but still , like dust , i 'll rise			0
" i never had the chance to meet @entity3			1
not in this life anyway			0
but her words have always been a constant companion to me and i pray they will remain so until the day our two souls meet			2
and on that day i will say to her with tears in my eyes , " hello , dear friend			0
" opinion : @entity3 : the definition of a phenomenal woman			1

@entity182 found inspiration in his darkest moments from @entity3 's writings
@entity182 : despite decline of books , the written word is still powerful and can heal
her last written words : " listen to yourself and in that quietude you might hear the voice of @entity142 "
