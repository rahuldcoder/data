-- @entity2 's attorney general thursday again asked the state @entity3 to overturn some 200 pardons , including those of convicted murderers , issued by former gov. @entity8 in january during his last days in office			1
in a brief , attorney general @entity10 argued that the case should be reheard because the " private personal rights " of the victims , as provided by the state constitution and the @entity18 ' @entity17 , were violated by the pardons			1
" i am so pleased			0
i am so happy that @entity10 is not ready to roll over and die yet , " said @entity19 , who was wounded by one of the pardoned killers			1
" we 're excited , " he said			0
@entity19 was shot in the head during a 1993 attack in which @entity25 gunned down @entity26 as she held her 6 - week - old son			0
@entity25 was her estranged husband and the child 's father			0
" our constitutional rights were violated , " said @entity31 , @entity26 ' sister			1
" we 're pretty happy about this news			0
" in january , during his last days in office , @entity8 issued pardons and clemencies to 214 people , including four convicted murderers and an armed robber , who were serving life sentences			1
a representative for @entity8 did not immediately return a call seeking comment			2
a representative for the attorney general told @entity0 that @entity10 would not have any comment on the motion			1
earlier this month , the @entity2 high court ruled @entity8 had complete power to pardon and his authority could not be challenged			2
in a statement after the court ruling , @entity8 said it " reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state , " but acknowledged that his decision has been difficult for many of the inmates ' victims			1
but in a dissenting opinion , state @entity3 @entity61 called the decision " a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons , and an immeasurable loss for the law - abiding citizens of our state			0
" @entity10 had argued that the state constitution requires that for a pardon to be valid , notices be filed each day for 30 days in newspapers where the crimes were committed			1
@entity8 , who also is former chairman of the @entity76 , has said that he believes in redemption and that people deserve second chances			2
most of the pardons involved convicts who had already served their time and have since been released from prison for their crimes			2
victims ' families have denounced the former governor for not meeting with them to discuss his reasons why he would show such leniency to these men			0
but thursday 's last - ditch attempt to short - circuit the pardons has given victims hope			2
i am so glad , so proud that we have an attorney general who cares about the people of @entity2 , " said @entity19 , the shooting victim			1
" i 'm so pleased			0
we thought we had to accept what was said and done , " he said			0
" my spirit has been renewed			0
