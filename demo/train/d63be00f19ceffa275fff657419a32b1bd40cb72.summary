" @entity14 , i have no intention to say anything about @entity14			0

and as their father is in @entity103 , the older brother may have become a father figure to the 19 - year - old these past few months			2
at 6 - foot - 3 , @entity2 was , by many accounts , an intimidating presence with increasingly strong convictions about society and religion in recent years			0
