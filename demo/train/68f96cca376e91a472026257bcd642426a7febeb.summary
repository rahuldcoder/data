this was no ordinary plane ride			2
no longer grounded for battery problems , @entity3 's @entity2 gained takeoff speed down a @entity7 runway monday , en route to @entity9			1
after months of concern about the 787 's future , the excitement and tension was palpable aboard the first domestic commercial flight since january 16			1
in @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17 , @entity18 , his wife @entity19 and 6 - year - old son @entity20 were going home after visiting the @entity22			2
@entity20 , wearing a red t - shirt and headphones , chewed gum with a serious look on his face as the plane raced toward the end of the runway			2
@entity19 had a pillow on her lap , her hands folded as she faced forward			2
at one point , her husband placed his hand on hers			2
the plane , carrying 219 passengers including many reporters and executives from @entity43 and @entity3 , began to lift into the air			1
outside the @entity47 's oversized windows , it was clear the plane 's wings were bending upward			1
dreamliner interactive : the @entity47 layout watching the wings of an airliner bend during takeoff might be a little bit disturbing for most passengers			1
but the wings of this plane are made mostly of carbon reinforced plastic			1
they 're supposed to bend			1
then , @entity47 's wheels magically left the @entity63			2
that triggered passenger applause that rang throughout the aircraft			2
the 787 was back in domestic service after being grounded because of fears of onboard lithium - ion battery fires			1
two incidents on @entity72 787s in january prompted the @entity73 to ground all six @entity74 , which are all operated by @entity3			2
engineers designed a fix of the system which involved insulating the batteries and putting them in a ventilated armor - plated box to protect the rest of the plane			2
@entity47 returns : five things to know ' it 's a relaunch ! ' dreamliner " was a fairly expensive piece of sculpture to have on the ground , " joked @entity3 ceo @entity84 during a pre-flight ceremony			1
the average list price for a 787 is currently about $ 207 million			2
his counterpart at manufacturer @entity43 apologized			1
" we 're very sorry about the delay caused by the technology workaround , " said @entity43 ceo @entity92			1
" safety means everything to us			2
" both men were passengers on flight 1			1
in @entity101 , @entity100 , 64 , was headed home after his oldest granddaughter 's high school graduation ceremony			2
he had no idea he was booked on arguably the most - watched airliner in @entity107 , touted by @entity43 as the " airplane of the future			1
" " it was a surprise to see the media circus , " he said			2
@entity18 also was in the dark about the flight until he arrived at the gate			1
was he concerned about the battery problems ? " i guess there 's a little bit of something in the back of my mind , " he said			2
but to have all these ceos on the plane , " he said he felt safe			0
aviation enthusiasts call it dreamliner 2.0			1
others call it reboot : 787			0
" it 's a relaunch ! " said a @entity3 flight attendant wearing the name tag , @entity129			1
" that 's what they told us to call it ! " up in the cockpit , capt. @entity136 clocked it at about @entity139 -- or 85 % of the speed of sound			0
the plane beat about 10 minutes off other airliners by the time it hit @entity9 traffic			0
the slick new cockpit display allows pilots to more easily see maps , speed and altitude data			0
" it 's easier to fly because we have better displays , " said capt. @entity151 , another pilot on flight 1			1
" it lands nice , it flies nice , it 's real responsive , it 's actually one of the easier planes i 've ever flown			0
" it also soars higher than other airliners			0
@entity152 maxed out at 41,000 feet -- which actually is 2,000 feet below its limit			0
a typical airliner altitude is around 30,000 feet up			0
but @entity47 's most important trick is to save on fuel expense			0
surprisingly , it takes less fuel to fly high			0
" that 's just how jet engines work , " said capt. @entity171 , another @entity3 pilot who attended the pre-flight ceremony			0
all airlines love to save fuel			0
that 's good for business -- and the environment			0
and it 's why @entity47 is seen as the " airliner of the future			0
" thrill of flight for this aviation enthusiast , the thrill of flying this airplane for the first time involved the bendy , plastic wings as they lifted the plane into the air on take off			1
at first , it does n't compute -- it looks so strange -- but then you realize this ai n't your daddy 's aluminum aircraft			0
its cutting edge carbon fiber technology is taking aviation to a new level , where special materials can make magic happen			1
@entity47 's cabin pressure is touted as a big relief for passengers who suffer from air sickness			0
the cabin pressure makes it feel like the equivalent of being at 6,000 feet above sea level , compared with typical airliners which are pressured at 8,000 feet			0
i did n't notice any difference at all , but i do n't suffer from air sickness			0
most of us passengers were n't discerning enough to notice the rarefied air , but the airliner 's larger windows , complete with " shades " made of gel that dims in response to electricity , were easier to spot and appreciate			1
now about the seats : they 're a comfy 17.3 inches across , which fit me fine , especially after enduring a torturous chair on a commuter plane the previous day			1
the plane 's seats are arranged in three rows of three chairs across , with two aisles			0
in first class , passengers stretch out on 22 - inch wide lay - flat seats in the 2 - by - 2 - by - 2 configuration			0
and what about @entity47 's other goodies ? -- specially designed cabin lighting to match the time of day -- cathedral - like cabin ceilings so high they would be impossible for most people to touch -- computers that sense imminent turbulence and command parts of the wing to make appropriate adjustments , smoothing out the ride a bit of unstable air rocked the plane early in the flight , but it was difficult to know how the plane 's anti-turbulence system affected the ride			1
airliner of the future ? the battery problems have been addressed , but the real proof of a successful fix will be in incident - free flights across the globe			0
with that kind of smooth flying , is the door still open for @entity47 to realize its promise as the game - changing airliner of the future ? can global aviation titans @entity43 and @entity3 put the 787 's troubled battery system behind them ? two battery overheating incidents on 787s sparked fears of possible inflight fires , prompting an announcement three months ago yanking all @entity278 out of service worldwide			1
some experts dismissed the battery problems as hiccups , glitches or teething pains that all new airliners experience			0
glitch or not -- it was the first @entity73 grounding of an entire airliner model in more than 30 years			1
supporters hailed the move as an abundance of caution			0
two weeks into the grounding , @entity72 carrier @entity294 said it had lost $ 15 million			1
in april , @entity43 would n't reveal how much the grounding was costing them , but it was " minimal			1
" for many of the thousands of employees at @entity43 and @entity3 who saw their futures tied to this plane , the grounding order was more than a little unnerving			1
of course , passengers were nervous too			0
grounding an airliner opens the door to damaging its reputation for safety , say experts			1
the previous @entity73 grounding in 1979 followed the terrible crash of the now - defunct @entity315 wide - body airliner			2
@entity316 crashed on takeoff from @entity9 and killed 273 people			0
authorities grounded the @entity315 for about a month until it could be determined that maintenance issues were to blame for the crash			0
the @entity315 suffered an image problem after that , said capt. @entity324 , president of the @entity325 , an independent aviation safety think tank , but that perception faded and the @entity315 went on to be relatively successful			2
the @entity73 's abundance of caution should n't be allowed to damage the @entity47 's image , say experts , who point out that no one has been hurt in any of the @entity47 incidents			0
" it 's a safe airliner to get back on and fly , " said @entity324			0
travelers , he said , should be very confident			0
under strict oversight , the @entity73 delegates certain certification activities to qualified experts , @entity43 says on its website			1
the battery fix included a team of @entity43 battery engineers and experts from outside the company			1
@entity348 president @entity347 wants an independent analysis of @entity43 's battery fix			1
he said federal authorities are " simply taking @entity43 's word for it " that the problem has been resolved and by delegating certification authority			1
" we think they made a mistake			2
" " there 's never been any proof that self - certification ever resulted in a problem in an aircraft , " said @entity358 , a former member of the @entity359 , the nation 's top aviation investigation agency			2
@entity324 is also comfortable with the process as it pertains to @entity47			0
but his group supports the idea that the @entity73 self - certification system should be reviewed , to bolster its safety			0
@entity47 's days of being the next big thing may be numbered			0
snapping at @entity43 's heels is its arch rival @entity374 , which is expected to start test flying its a350 xwb later this year			1
in the wake of @entity43 's lithium - ion battery challenges , @entity374 decided not to go with the same technology in the new plane -- opting instead for traditional -- and heavier -- nickel - cadmium batteries			1
@entity374 rolls out sleek , new @entity376 shortly after it was grounded , @entity3 said flyers would " flock back " to the game changing aircraft after the battery problems were fixed			0
for @entity3 and domestic travelers , the game started all over again on monday			1
we 'll see how much things change			0
and we 'll keep you posted .			0

first domestic commercial dreamliner flight since grounding was completed on monday
@entity43 ceo : " we 're very sorry about the delay caused by the technology workaround "
