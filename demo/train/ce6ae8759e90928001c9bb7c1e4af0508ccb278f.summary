@entity0 -- with just days to go before the @entity2 open in @entity0 , questions over the provision of security guards for the event are dominating the @entity8 media			1
thousands of team officials and athletes are arriving this week , and throngs of visitors are expected to follow			0
but should they be worried ? the security concerns were triggered last week when it emerged that private security contractor @entity16 , which was supposed to have provided 10,400 guards for the @entity18 and @entity19 , would not be able to deliver			1
its failure to recruit , train and vet enough staff in time led the government to announce last week that it was deploying an extra 3,500 troops to cover the shortfall			1
@entity16 said it has only about 4,000 guards trained and ready , although it hopes to have 7,000 fully accredited by the time the @entity2 begin on july 27			1
while the recruitment failure by @entity16 is highly embarrassing for the company -- and led its share price to drop sharply -- the @entity2 ' organizers insist that their contingency planning will keep everyone safe			1
visitors can certainly expect to see far more visible security measures in place than usual at @entity2 venues and transport hubs			1
@entity40 , the chairman of the @entity0 organizing group , @entity41 , said tuesday that the only real difference resulting from the @entity16 debacle would be in who is performing the security checks			2
" the numbers really have n't changed			0
it 's really simply about the mix of security on the park , " he was quoted as saying by the @entity49 news agency			2
@entity41 is working with @entity16 to try to ensure that as many people as possible are accredited in time , @entity40 said , adding , " this is not a failure in numbers			2
we 've got the numbers there			0
there 's no compromise on security			2
" home secretary @entity63 gave a similar message last week as she was grilled by lawmakers on the matter , saying , " there is no question of @entity2 security being compromised			1
" critics have been less positive , with some @entity72 lawmakers concerned that security will be inadequate or that visitors will be made uncomfortable by a prominent military presence			2
the chief executive of @entity16 , @entity77 , was forced to agree tuesday under questioning from lawmakers that the security staffing fiasco is " a humiliating shambles for the country			2
" the @entity81 said monday that @entity16 is suffering from a software problem , which means the contractor can not guarantee who will turn up where and whether guards have the right training			2
the guards employed by @entity16 will be responsible chiefly for such tasks as providing venue perimeter security , a spokesman for the contractor said			1
this includes manning x-ray machines , searching people , searching vehicles and operating closed - circuit television systems , he said			0
people with tickets for @entity2 events have been sent e-mails giving details of the security requirements for each venue			2
these include airport - style limits on the size of bags that can be carried and the quantity of liquids that can be taken in			1
one such e-mail reads , " be prepared for security checks when you arrive : this will be like taking an international flight at an airport			2
it will be busy and you will have to queue , so get there early			0
" the 17,000 @entity8 military personnel deployed for the @entity2 , including the extra 3,500 troops called up at short notice , are to help out with the security checks and stewarding at venues , as well as specialist tasks such as bomb disposal and sniffer dog searches			1
military jets and helicopters are also on standby around the capital , ready to respond to any threat , and new airspace restrictions came into force saturday around @entity0 and the southeast			0
the @entity135 's largest ship , the helicopter carrier @entity137 , is now moored in the @entity138 off @entity139 , where it will act as a base for helicopter operations and house 400 troops providing security at the @entity2 venue			1
police in @entity0 and elsewhere also will play a big role in ensuring security			0
well before the @entity16 debacle hit the headlines , @entity0 's @entity150 , known as the @entity150 , was planning what it says is its biggest - ever peacetime operation			1
the operation will " run for 66 days and cover over 1,000 venues , including those hosting @entity2 and @entity159 sports , cultural events and 2012 - themed celebrations taking place across the capital , " the website says			1
on the busiest days , up to 9,500 police officers will be used , including some from forces outside @entity0 , for games - related operations , it says			0
officers at @entity2 venues will focus on preventing crime and keeping people and their property safe , while @entity16 is responsible for the security operation , it says			1
away from the venues , the @entity150 will also have to provide the usual policing for the city and its visitors			2
the @entity2 come just over a year after parts of @entity0 were rocked by rioting that led to police being brought in from elsewhere in @entity183 to help bring the disorder under control			0
the threat of a potential terrorist strike has also been in the news in recent days after a number of arrests , although police said the operations were not linked to the @entity2			0
the terror threat level on the @entity81 website remains unchanged at " substantial , " which is the third highest of five levels			0
the next level up is " severe , " which means an attack is " highly likely , " and the highest is " critical , " meaning an attack is " expected imminently			0
" government officials from @entity201 to @entity0 insist that there are no known specific or credible terror threats tied to the @entity18			0
travel to and around the @entity8 will nevertheless be a focus of security efforts			2
visitors arriving at @entity0 's @entity209 can expect to see every desk at passport control manned during the @entity2 , the home secretary said last week			1
immigration desks have extra staffers , @entity209 said monday , amid fears of long lines to get into the country as security checks are carried out			0
retired border officials and retired police officers are among those being brought in to supplement immigration staff , the @entity81 said			0
officials from outside the @entity8 may also be lending a hand in certain areas			0
the @entity8 @entity224 said a small number of staff from the @entity228 @entity227 will be based at certain @entity8 airports " to act as an on - site liaison for the @entity227			1
" the @entity227 staffers will not , however , be conducting security screening or inspections , the @entity224 said			0
@entity235 spokesman @entity234 said tuesday that his country has full faith and confidence in @entity8 's ability to provide security			1
the @entity228 is sending senior diplomatic security staff to @entity8 to act as liaisons , @entity234 said , adding that the @entity227 has a " handful " of agents in the country			1
meanwhile , @entity0 's public transport authorities have been warning commuters for weeks to avoid travel hotspots around the time of the @entity2 -- but have not stressed any additional security risk			1
the city 's transport network is not immune to terror threats , as the attacks of july 2005 showed			0
but visitors can seek reassurance in the fact that @entity8 's police and intelligence officials have been successful since then in foiling attacks on the capital			1
in the 2005 incident , three bombs were detonated on underground trains and one on a bus in the city			0
the blasts killed 52 people and wounded more than 770			0
culture secretary @entity270 , who is in charge of the @entity2 preparations , said it will be " a very safe and secure @entity18			1
" " we have had a contractor who has let us down ... but we had a contingency plan in place , " he said			0
" it 's not possible to secure every single square inch of a huge global city like @entity0 , but where there are important concentrations of @entity2 activity ... then there will be a security regime before you can enter those			1
obviously the actual @entity2 venues will be very tightly secured			1
" @entity270 said the vigilance of the public will also be important			0
" so far , we have not received intelligence of any particular additional threats , but this is a city that has huge experience of dealing with security issues over very many years , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity298 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity235 has full faith and confidence in @entity8 's security measures
security contractor @entity16 has failed to train and recruit enough security staff
culture secretary @entity270 says it will be " a very safe and secure @entity18 "
visitors will encounter airport - style security measures at @entity2 venues
