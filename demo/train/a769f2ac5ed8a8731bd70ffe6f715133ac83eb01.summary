the torch 's arrival in the capital begins the final week before the @entity3 open and the final stage in its long journey			1
more than 10 million people have already lined the streets of more than 1,000 communities around @entity17 to see the torch , which has been carried by more than 7,000 torchbearers , @entity3 organizers said			1
nearly 1,000 more will carry the torch along nearly 200 miles of @entity0 streets over the coming week , before it takes a starring role at the opening ceremony at the @entity22 on july 27			1
read about @entity23 passing the @entity3 flame to @entity17 eighteen torchbearers will carry the flame on the final day of the relay , with seven of them traveling with it down the @entity29 on the royal barge @entity31 , which played a central role in the @entity34 river pageant for @entity35 the torch 's arrival at the @entity7 on friday evening promises to be eye - catching			1
a @entity39 commando , carrying the flame in a lantern , will abseil -- the technique known as " rappel " in the @entity44 -- 180 feet from a @entity45 into the grounds , where @entity0 mayor @entity47 will be waiting to greet it			1
the torch will be carried around @entity7 , which dates back to the 11th century , before spending the night in the safekeeping of the @entity51 , home of the @entity52			2
the buildup to the @entity3 has been overshadowed by a security fiasco caused by the failure of contractor @entity56 to supply enough guards for the @entity3			1
2012 @entity3 flame lit in ancient stadium but @entity47 told @entity1 's @entity60 that while @entity0 authorities are not complacent , he is confident in their ability to keep visitors safe			1
" we do everything in our power to maximize security at the venues and that 's working well now -- the army , the military as well as @entity56 are providing very safe conditions on the site , plus there is a huge amount of work that nobody has seen involving the intelligence service , " the mayor said " that 's something about an event like this -- you listen out for what may or may not be happening on the @entity84 , you try as hard as you possibly can to monitor the potential suspects			2
" @entity47 said it is impossible to guard against all " unknown unknowns " and that 's why strong security is needed at venues			0
" at no stage can you guarantee that someone wo n't do something moronic , stupid , violent and tragic , not just in @entity0 but the whole of the @entity17 is a potential target in this period , " he said			2

the threat level as far as we are aware has slightly come down in the last 12 months , but you can never be certain			0
" look at photos of the journey of the @entity3 flame authorities said thursday that an additional 1,200 @entity17 troops were being placed on standby for the @entity3			1
the company 's recruitment shortfall had already forced the government to call in 3,500 extra military personnel to help			0
culture secretary @entity111 , the minister in charge of overseeing the @entity3 , said that there was no need to deploy extra troops but that putting 1,200 on standby means they can be moved within 48 hours rather than seven days if required			2
@entity56 has a Â £ 284 million ( $ 444 million ) government contract to provide 10,400 security staff for the @entity3 , but only about 4,000 guards are trained and ready			1
it expects to provide at least 7,000 by the time the @entity3 start , chief executive @entity119 told lawmakers earlier this week			2
home secretary @entity122 gave more details on how the fiasco unfolded in a letter sent to the head of @entity128 's @entity127 on thursday			0
although the @entity129 did not become aware of the full extent of the shortfall until july 11 , @entity56 had alerted the government to " scheduling problems " affecting staff numbers on june 28 , she said			0
once it became clear how large the shortfall would be , the government put its contingency plans into operation , she wrote			0
" @entity56 will still be making a substantial contribution to venue security , " she wrote			0
" all @entity56 personnel working on venue security duties will have had training for the role they are undertaking , " may added			0
