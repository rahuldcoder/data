is this the @entity2 car of the future ? @entity4 has taken the unusual step of unveiling its concept for a radical car redesign on its team website			1
the streamlined design , which more closely resembles a regular @entity4 sports car , was created by the team 's @entity12 design studio			1
@entity4 explained it aimed to create a car that is " not only technologically advanced , but also captivating to the eye and aggressive - looking			2
" it added : " our challenge was to create something that was -- to put it short -- better looking			0
" the oldest team in @entity2 , already a style icon with its scarlet livery and @entity23 logo , invited fans to comment on its concept on its website and through social media			0
but @entity4 probably did not expect to elicit a response from racing and car design rivals @entity31 , winners of four straight team and driver titles between 2009 and 2011 thanks to the superior aerodynamic design of @entity36			1
@entity37 posted its car concept , designed by @entity36 for a computer game in 2014 on @entity40 with the cheeky message , " way ahead of ya , @ @entity4 ; ) " the aesthetics of @entity2 cars have attracted plenty of criticism in recent seasons			1
who can forget the duck - billed platypus and anteater noses of 2012 ? " it would be good if a bit more consideration was given to aesthetics in the drafting of the regulations , " suggested @entity36 in an interview with @entity2 last season			0
the rules on car design are carefully laid out in millimeters by the sport 's governing body , the @entity61 , whose main aim is to curb speed and increase safety			2
@entity4 says its concept could roar into reality on track " without having to overturn the current technical rules			0
" with the second winter test starting in @entity73 on thursday , @entity2 's nine teams are still fine tuning a radical rule change , focused on engine technology , which was introduced in 2014			1
the costs of that regulation change has already seen two teams -- @entity79 and @entity80 -- slide off the 2015 grid because of a lack of funding			0
while @entity4 have one eye on the future of @entity2 , the @entity4 is also absorbing more immediate changes			2
during the winter break , the team has welcomed a new president , @entity90 , new team boss , @entity92 , and new driver , @entity94 , as well as restructuring its technical department			0
the 2015 @entity4 car was fastest in the opening winter test , but testing times can be deceptive and the team 's true comparative pace will only be revealed at the opening @entity102 @entity2 on march 15			1
@entity4 may be thinking of the future but , after failing to win a race in 2014 , they remain focused on present car improvements for now .			0
