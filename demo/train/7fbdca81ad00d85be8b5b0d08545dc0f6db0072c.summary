@entity0 -- violence has returned to the streets of @entity4 -- this time in fresh confrontations between army forces and @entity8 protesters			0
accounts of the casualties vary but an @entity13 health ministry spokesman told @entity1 that 25 people had been killed and more than 272 injured during the weekend protests that were sparked by the burning of a @entity17 in southern @entity13			1
there has been long - standing tension between @entity13 's @entity20 and @entity21 but @entity1 's @entity22 in @entity4 says that since this year 's revolution that removed the former president @entity25 there have been more of these clashes			1
in the aftermath of the latest violence , @entity13 's prime minister @entity27 has vowed to ban all discrimination based on religion , language , gender or ethnicity			2
but why has the violence erupted after a revolution which promises to deliver fresh democratic elections , who are the @entity20 and what will the new measures achieve ? @entity1 examines the background			1
after a revolution that brought change , do people have renewed confidence in being able to protest ? are they seeing an opportunity to make their voices heard ahead of elections ? @entity22 reports that at least among activists , there is a growing concern that any form of political activity , particularly demonstrations , that target the regime will be met by the kind of force used sunday evening one @entity20 man told our correspondent that the military is more than happy to allow " millions of @entity64 fundamentalists to occupy @entity65 every friday , and cooperate with them in doing so , but when it comes to people who criticize -- copts , @entity21 , secular people -- the military , they use their guns			1
" he says it 's also important to keep in mind that one thing that occupies the minds of many @entity13 is that since the revolution the economy has gone from bad to worse			2
tourists are scarce , foreign investment is drying up			0
one @entity13 told him : " if people do n't get back to work within the next five months , there could be famine and chaos			0
" why did the military react with such a heavy hand , given its experiences in the revolution ? @entity22 says it is a good question to which no one really has an answer , but offers this analysis : during the revolution the army stood on the sidelines , and were cheered by the masses the military , however , adds @entity22 , is not an organization which by its nature is well adapted to dealing with civil disturbances , and that has been clear for some time			1
they often stand by when the situation goes out of control -- something they did during the revolution when regime thugs tried to attack the protesters in @entity65			0
there are concerns among some that with the spread of @entity64 fundamentalism within @entity13 society as a whole that religious hardliners have gained a foothold in the officer corps , and that is reflected in the way they dealt with the @entity20 protesters			1
one sometimes hears @entity21 describe @entity122 as " kufar " -- infidel -- even though the traditional interpretation of @entity64 was that @entity122 and @entity126 are not " kufar " but rather " @entity130 " -- the people of the book -- meaning that they are followers of books holy in the @entity129 tradition			1
who are the @entity20 ? the @entity20 make up somewhere between 8 and 11 % of the 80 million @entity13 , most of whom are @entity21			1
they are not ethnically distinct			0
they base their theology on the teachings of the @entity139 , who introduced @entity17 to @entity13 , according to @entity140 in @entity141 , the capital of @entity17			0
copts split from other @entity122 in the 5th century over the definition of the divinity of @entity145			0
the @entity20 have been a target of violence in the past but there have been dozens of casualties this year			1
the @entity151 bombing of a @entity20 church in @entity141 left 23 people dead , and during sectarian clashes in @entity4 on may 7 at least 12 people were killed			1
the most recent protests follow the september 30 burning of the @entity159 church in @entity160 , a city in @entity161 in southern @entity13			0
sectarian violence in @entity13 is nothing new			0
@entity164 , associate fellow of the @entity166 and @entity167 at the @entity168 think tank in @entity0 , says the sources of tension have focused on religious conversions , attacks on places of worship and @entity20 resentment that they are not being given licenses to build new churches the @entity179 , an independent bipartisan federal agency , earlier this year added @entity13 to a list of countries named as the worst violators of religious freedom			1
the @entity20 church @entity13 's coptic christians and the crisis why have we seen an upsurge in sectarian violence this year ? the reasons are not clear but @entity164 points to two possibilities 1 ) attempts by those opposed to democratic changes put in place by the revolution earlier this year to stir up trouble			1
2 ) efforts by extreme @entity200 groups to resist attempts by the @entity20 to establish more churches in the new democratic era			1
however , @entity1 's @entity22 reports that the @entity64 community has sent condolences to the @entity20 in response to the weekend deaths - and there are similar sentiments being expressed on @entity210 with many calling for greater religious tolerance			1
so what are the concerns now ? @entity20 are increasingly worried about their future in @entity13			2
@entity22 says many are worried that the de-facto rulers of @entity13 , the @entity216 ( @entity216 ) , have concluded an under - the - table alliance with the @entity219 and the hard - line conservative @entity220 as a means to cement their hold on power			2
" and this perceived alliance shuts out not just @entity122 , but also secular activists , liberals and others who are worried about the excessive power of those who use religion as a cover for their political ambitions , " he said			0
will the new measures to ban intolerance make a difference ? again , our correspondent says there is a lot of skepticism about the willingness of the military or the government to make good on these promises			2
he said similar promises were made in may when there was an outbreak of sectarian violence in @entity4 that left more than 10 people dead			0
the government formed a @entity252 , composed of @entity64 , @entity20 representatives and military and government officials			1
several members of the @entity252 have resigned or suspended their membership in protest after sunday 's violence and the army 's actions			0
@entity22 says there have been growing calls from prominent politicians for the resignation of the prime minister who is seen as weak and ineffectual at addressing sectarian issues			2
what does this mean for the @entity13 government ? @entity164 says the weekend violence presents a serious challenge for @entity13 in this transitional period			2
but she says the reaction of the armed forces and overwhelming use of force reflects a military that is unable to deal with dissent			1
" questions have to be asked about who gave the orders and the clumsy way they dealt with protesters , " she said			0
both @entity164 and @entity22 say the government reaction looked similar to that of the old regime , while the military response has also attracted criticism from @entity21			1
in may this year , @entity291 , a fellow and program officer at @entity293 , wrote on the @entity1 website that much should be expected of @entity13 's newly - empowered @entity219			1
" repressed and officially banned under @entity25 , the @entity219 is now the most coherent opposition force in the country and is calling for the emphasis of @entity64 in @entity13 's politics , " he said			2
so will the process of change be affected ? moves towards a democratically - elected @entity13 government have been difficult			0
the @entity302 has been trying to encourage the government to lift the state of emergency , and a coalition of 60 political groups previously threatened to boycott parliamentary elections set to start in november unless their demands were met			0
an agreement reached saturday included a promise to consider abolishing military tribunals and plans to draft a document to guide the creation of a new constitution			0
but some activists said the agreement fails to meet all the demands of the popular uprising			0
" there are very serious challenges - both sectarian and economic - but i think we are heading for greater democratization , " said @entity164			2
" it 's very hard to reverse that			0
i think it 's going to be very hard to delay elections			0

coptic christians make up between 8 *-11* % of the population , most of whom are @entity21
tensions focus on religious conversions , attacks on places of worship and resentment over building licenses
@entity1 's @entity22 says @entity344 has sent condolences to the @entity20
@entity164 says the use of force reflects a military that is unable to deal with dissent
