-- i was late to work one recent morning			0
i was out getting married			1
@entity2 , my partner of 12 years , was losing her health benefits			1
we needed to add her to my family plan by june 1 and it was already may 31			0
we have a 7 - year - old daughter			1
you do n't mess with this stuff			1
so we left our child at elementary school , grabbed two mamas at drop - off to serve as witnesses , and hopped a cab to @entity17			1
the @entity19 crew produced white - frosted cupcakes to mark the occasion			2
i worried about making it to work			0
@entity2 looked like she was there to get a tooth extracted			1
it 's hard to get jazzed about this stuff when you are rushing to only getting half married			1
i call it half married because , in our situation , the only benefit this @entity31 state marriage brought us was the right to put her on my company insurance plan , a benefit that would be taxed as income by the federal government because they do n't recognize same - sex marriages			1
if my employer did n't offer to offset the tax , a rare benefit in @entity46 companies , i 'd actually be signing up for something more expensive than i could buy on the open market			2
that 's not the only limitation with a state marriage , which brought us benefits we 'd already acquired through legal documents			1
there are 1,138 federal benefits to marriage you do n't get as a gay couple who are married in @entity31 , like @entity60 , @entity61 , inheritance rights , veterans ' benefits and rights as joint parents			1
we could jam wedding cake down each other 's throats at a big party , just like the others , but cupcakes at the justice of the peace seemed fine for this			2
same - sex spouses entitled to federal benefits the truth is we got out of the marriage debate ages ago			1
this was only paperwork affirming what we already knew			0
we declared ourselves self - married back in 2001 during a romantic trip to @entity85 , @entity86			1
i engaged in drop - to - your - knee romanticism at our spa hotel , produced a diamond ring and made all sorts of fresh - love promises			2
we were the only ones we told back then , and that felt like enough			0
ten years earlier , as a journalist , i had covered the 1991 case of gay couples in @entity97 who sued for the right to marry			2
opponents would successfully persuade 38 state legislatures and the federal government to bar recognition of same - sex marriages out of concern that they would be made legal			1
i 'd watched this fight firsthand and wanted no part of it			0
we had made our private commitment in the absence of legal benefits and divorced ourselves from the ongoing public fight			2
i was a journalist who wanted to see every side of this debate , not become a part of it			0
in 1999 , i traveled to @entity117 , @entity118 , when that state came close to allowing even a limited state - sanctioned marriage between two people of the same gender			1
a state legislator showed me a stack of old legal papers			0
" this is what ' married ' means in @entity118 , " he said , adding they would replace the word with " civil union " to satisfy a state court ruling that the @entity118 constitution guaranteed equal treatment for gays			1
a simple search - and - replace of wording would allow @entity118 to create separate but equal institutions			2
other states followed suit , including @entity31 , which allowed domestic partnerships			0
so @entity2 and i went and got one of those in 2002 , for no other reason than giving our union the paperwork needed for all sorts of things			1
we did n't need a cake or party then , either , but a notary public at @entity152 jumped up and hugged us both when he saw what he was certifying			2
then we dispassionately dropped off the papers at a window that the city clerk had created next to the dog license registry			0
opinion : for gays , progress stunning , fast the next year -- exactly 10 years ago today -- the @entity46 @entity161 , in deciding @entity160 , ruled that it was legal for two people of the same gender to have sex , essentially legalizing being gay			1
justice @entity167 said in his dissent , " today 's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions , insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned , " @entity167 wrote			1
" if moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is ' no legitimate state interest ' for purposes of proscribing that conduct ... what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples			1
. ? " that seemed very far away			0
around that time , gay people began seizing every opportunity to get sort - of married			1
they traveled to @entity189 and rushed to appear before activist justices of the peace in @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194			0
i interviewed people who got married over and over again , before judges would shut everything down and make them unmarried			2
these did n't feel like weddings to me ; they felt like news stories , protest weddings that came without the gift of benefits			1
they meant something to the people exchanging rings , but i felt no more or less legally married than they were , so it was easy to remain objective about what these things meant			2
@entity215 courts ruled gays had a constitutional right to marry and , on may 17 , 2004 , i watched the first ever same - sex couples legally wed in the @entity46			1
our friends got annoyed when we said we were n't rushing up to @entity215 to get married			1
we had n't called ourselves " married " years earlier to make a point			1
we had made a commitment			0
rushing off to get married in @entity215 , when we lived in @entity31 , felt like activism			2
i was far from that when it came to this issue			0
by that fall i was pregnant with @entity227 and suddenly there was a need for all sorts of legal paperwork			0
absent the right to marry in @entity31 , we spent thousands obtaining health care proxies , wills and creating joint ownership of our apartment			0
when she was born we told her we were married			2
" @entity241 ! " she would shout and urge us to both kiss her cheeks at once and affirm her family trio			0
" i have two @entity241			0
" but her two @entity241 were not both legally her parents			0
we spent another $ 10,000 on a second - parent adoption to make us both her legal parents , even though we had no legal relationship to each other			2
i 've filed taxes each year as a single parent , which actually made my tax situation better			0
there were definitely good and bad benefits associated to the right to marry			2
opinion : fight for gay rights must continue then our own state recognized same - sex marriages and suddenly the social pressure was on us to get " gay married			1
" a dozen states allow gays to marry , but this was the one we live in			0
at the time , it seemed to us that we got no practical benefit from a state marriage given all the paperwork we had completed			2
we 'd already made our commitment and had the acceptance and love of our friends and families			0
our employers recognized our relationships and our child was safe			0
@entity275 lit up with emotional appeals to get to the altar , but we were simply not in a marrying way			0
i felt like this was still a story for me to tell , not live			0
the only struggle we had was how to explain this debate to @entity227 , who believed her parents were already married			2
did she need us to get " married " yet again ? for our anniversary we went to see a play called " standing on @entity288 , " in which @entity289 plays a guy named @entity291 eulogizing his dead partner			1
@entity291 asks if they should get married and the dying man asks what that would mean about the last 45 years of their lives together			1
i asked myself the same question			0
if @entity2 and i suddenly got a state marriage , would we find ourselves celebrating our first anniversary a year later , as if we did n't already have a 7 - year - old child , a home we 'd owned for 10 years , a relationship we 'd built over 12 years ? what finally brought us to the city clerk 's office was the requirement that our marriage be sanctioned by the state of @entity31 for me to add @entity2 to my family health insurance -- call it a modern shotgun wedding			1
the marriage bureau staff ushered us into a room where cases displayed old marriage records of turn - of - the - century brides and grooms			1
we stood at an altar in work attire while the @entity241 readied their iphones for pictures			0
we took off the rings we 'd worn for the last 12 years			1
the justice of the peace read traditional vows in a booming voice , then directed us to put our rings back on each other			0
the whole thing went down in about two minutes , and @entity2 inexplicably began to cry , which made me cry			1
there were pictures of us jamming the @entity241 ' cupcakes down each other 's throats			0
then we all rushed off to work			0
this morning we had warned @entity227 at breakfast that the @entity46 @entity161 was deciding today whether " gay " people can be legally married			1
" you 're lesbians , " she declared , checking to see if that word , " gay , " included us too			0
then she began listing all the people she knows who would be affected , starting with the children			0
i dropped her off for her last day of school and she said : " love you , @entity19 " and i got a kiss			0
an hour later , the @entity46 @entity161 married us all over again -- a decision that changed everything , and nothing at all			1
opinion : how youth led change in public attitudes			0

@entity0 's @entity357 and her partner , @entity2 , were together 12 years before they married
the couple were only " half married , " @entity357 says , because they did n't have full benefits
a @entity161 ruling today struck down some *barriers* to same - sex marriage
