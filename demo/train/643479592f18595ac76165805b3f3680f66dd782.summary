-- @entity1 came from behind to beat arch - rivals @entity2 3 - 2 in the @entity3 in the first leg of the @entity5 on thursday			1
@entity7 champions real took a 55th minute lead when @entity9 headed home from a @entity12 corner , but their lead lasted just a minute as @entity14 equalized for the home side			2
the game had come to life in the second half and both sides had good opportunities before @entity21 scored from the penalty spot after @entity23 had pulled down @entity24			1
@entity25 star @entity24 then set away his midfield partner @entity26 to score @entity1 's third			1
a comfortable two - goal advantage seemed enough to set the seal on a great night for the @entity31 giants			2
but they were undone five minutes from time when their goalkeeper @entity34 tried to take the ball around @entity37 , lost possession and gifted the @entity39 an open goal			1

" we asked him to do that			0
if he boots the ball down the field we would n't have any semblance of a passing style of play , " said @entity53			0
" during these years he 's given us a lot and he 's helped us build our play up from the back			0
" the result is n't definitive for either side			0
it 's good that we won but we could have ended the match with a larger margin of victory yet , in the end , the result was pretty tight			0
" real boss @entity73 admitted that his side had struggled at the outset , but battled back into the game			0
" i did n't enjoy the first half			0
sometimes you play a way you do n't want to			0
the opponent has the ability to change the game plan you have and @entity1 did that in the first half , " @entity73 said			2
" they pressed well and did n't let us play			0
we defended well and we occupied defensive positions , but @entity1 was better			2
it might appear as though it was a defensive plan , but it was n't and we showed that in the second half , where we played completely differently			0
" in @entity92 qualifying action thursday , an own goal from @entity90 gave @entity93 a 1 - 0 win at @entity96 side @entity95 in their first leg tie			1
