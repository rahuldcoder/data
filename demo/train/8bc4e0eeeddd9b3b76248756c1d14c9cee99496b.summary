@entity0 -- if you lived in @entity0 from the late 1970s through the mid- 1990s , you either loved or loathed @entity3			1
he could be colorful and generous , or , if you were his enemy , it is said he could be cutthroat and cruel			0
in a federal courtroom in @entity0 on wednesday , @entity3 , who spent more than 16 years in hiding , finally faced the judicial system			1
charged with murder in the killings of 19 people , @entity3 , wearing jeans and a green , long - sleeved t - shirt , listened intently as prosecutors and his lawyers gave opening statements			1
with references to @entity18 , @entity19 and the " @entity20 " in @entity21 , the trial of @entity0 's most famous fugitive got under way			0
@entity3 , 83 , who prosecutors said was the head of the @entity25 mob in @entity0 for nearly two decades , sat slightly hunched , watching grainy black - and - white surveillance videos of him as he appeared more than 30 years ago , trimmer and only slightly balding			1
in one of the clips , @entity3 punches the air and uses his fingers as guns as he animatedly talks to several mob associates			1
describing @entity3 as a " hands - on killer , " prosecutor @entity34 told the jury @entity3 " did the dirty work himself			1
" he described how @entity3 ruthlessly shot one mob associate after attempts to strangle him failed because the rope he was using was too thick			1
" you want one to the head ? " @entity3 reportedly said			1
" yes , please , " the victim was said to have answered			0
describing another killing , @entity34 said , " @entity47 came calling in the form of @entity3 , " who allegedly lured his victim to a phone booth and then opened fire , along with partner @entity53			1
the trial is expected to take up to three months and has the potential to reveal sensational details about the mob and @entity59 corruption , especially if @entity3 chooses to testify			1
his attorney , @entity60 , portrayed @entity3 not as a killer but as the head of a successful criminal enterprise of drug trafficking , extortion and loan sharking that brought in " millions upon millions of dollars			1
" his client would not leave his " comfort zone " to kill someone in another state , as prosecutors allege			0
@entity60 took aim at rogue @entity59 agents and police who were on " @entity3 's payroll , " both to protect him and to alert him to impending wiretaps , surveillance efforts and indictments			2
the government will try to show that @entity3 committed crimes while working as an informant for the @entity59 , revealing to the feds the mafia 's secrets and corrupting them in the process to ignore his crimes			2
@entity3 never worked as an informant , @entity60 said , adding that " the worst thing " a person of @entity25 descent could do would be to inform			2
but the defense acknowledged for the first time that @entity3 was involved in drug trafficking and that he made millions of dollars from it			1
the defense blamed the cooperating witnesses for the killings , saying they are falsely blaming @entity3 for their own acts			1
@entity60 urged the jurors to be skeptical about the credibility of the government 's planned witnesses			0
" would you believe them beyond a reasonable doubt when you add the unbelievable incentives the government has given them ? " he asked			0
@entity3 rose to the top of the notorious @entity110 gang , prosecutors say , before he went into hiding for more than 16 years after an @entity59 agent told him in december 1994 that he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges			1
but @entity60 claimed @entity3 fled not because he was given the heads up on an impending indictment , but because he heard on the radio that federal agents were rounding up mobsters , an account heard for the first time ever			2
@entity3 was captured in @entity121 , @entity122 , two years ago , living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city			1
at his july 2011 arraignment , he pleaded not guilty to the 19 murder charges and 13 other counts			1
in the pretrial hearings , @entity3 had argued he was given immunity by the @entity59 and a former prosecutor			1
a judge dismissed the claim , saying any purported immunity was not a defense against the crimes @entity3 faces			1
besides the slayings , @entity3 is accused of using violence , force and threats to shake down @entity0 's bookmakers , loan sharks and drug dealers			2
the @entity25 mob allegedly laundered its ill - gotten gains through liquor stores , bars and other property it owned in @entity0			0
" the guy is a sociopathic killer , " @entity151 , the organized crime investigator who spent most of his career with the @entity153 trying to put @entity3 behind bars , told @entity1 in 2011			1
" he loved that type of life			0
he 's one of the hardest and cruelest individuals that operated in the @entity0 area			0
he 's a bad , bad , bad guy			0
" tracking suspects down : some landmark @entity163 manhunts former @entity165 reporter @entity164 , who wrote a book about @entity3 , described him as a coldblooded killer whose gang went to lengths to avoid detection			1
" when they killed someone -- this is @entity172 -- they pulled the teeth out , cut the fingers off , tried to make it so the victims , if they were discovered from their graves , could n't be identified			0
there 's just no bottom			0
it does n't get much uglier than someone like @entity3 , " @entity164 said			2
few people knew @entity3 was a rat			2
@entity59 agent @entity188 , who was raised in the same housing projects as @entity3 , cut a deal with the alleged mob figure in 1975			2
@entity3 would give information about the @entity195 mob -- the @entity59 's prime target -- authorities said			2
protected by the rogue @entity59 agent , @entity3 got names of other informants who had dirt on him and rival gang members , people he is accused of killing			2
he knew when police were watching , knew when they were moving in			0
after he fled @entity0 , he spent more than a decade on the @entity59 's @entity202 before his 2011 capture			0
his girlfriend , @entity204 , was sentenced to eight years in prison last summer for helping him evade capture			0
@entity188 is serving a 50 - year sentence for second - degree murder and racketeering			1
prosecutors plan to call as many as 80 witnesses			0
among them will be @entity188 and @entity213 , who was also an informant for the @entity59			0
he is serving life terms without parole but avoided a possible death sentence by cooperating in the hunt for @entity3			2
on wednesday , @entity60 called @entity213 " a psychopath without a conscience			0
" other former @entity3 associates are expected to be called by the prosecution			0
last august , @entity60 said his client planned to testify			0
" at this point in his life , his goal is to have the truth come out regarding how he was able to act with impunity for so long in the city of @entity0 , " @entity60 told @entity1 affiliate @entity223			0
@entity1 's @entity231 and @entity232 reported from @entity0 , @entity230 reported and wrote from @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
