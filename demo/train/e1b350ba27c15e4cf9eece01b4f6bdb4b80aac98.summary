@entity0 -- court documents obtained by @entity1 on friday reveal disturbing new details about the prior conviction of the alleged ringleader of a group charged this week with imprisoning four mentally disabled adults in a dank @entity0 boiler room			1
@entity9 , 51 , served eight years in prison for killing her sister 's boyfriend , @entity11 , in the early 1980s , according to @entity0 police			1
the newly obtained documents show @entity11 , held captive in a closet , weighed 75 pounds at the time of his death by starvation in december 1981			1
the medical examiner at the time determined the cause of death " due to the clear visibility of his protruding ribs , sunken cheeks and emaciated body , " according to the documents			1
@entity37 , along with three others , is currently facing charges including criminal conspiracy , aggravated assault , kidnapping , criminal trespass , unlawful restraint and false imprisonment after the landlord of an apartment building discovered saturday four malnourished people locked in a 15 - by - 6 - foot room with no food and only a bucket for a toilet , according to @entity0 police			2
testimony in the @entity11 case showed the man was fed only four times while held in the closet for about two months , and was removed from the tiny space only " six or seven times " during his captivity			1
" when he finally died of malnutrition , the sisters wheeled him in a baby carriage to an abandoned building where he was discovered two days later , " one of the documents states			2
it was not immediately clear which sisters the documents referred to			2
the court documents show @entity37 was initially found incompetent to stand trial			1
two years later , after being hospitalized , she was certified by the court and found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and criminal conspiracy , according to @entity0 police and court documents			1
the court found she " was legally sane " at the time she held @entity11 captive and " had the full intent to conspire " with her siblings when she directed them to dispose of the body			2
the current investigation into @entity37 and her alleged co-conspirators has taken several bizarre twists as authorities try to piece together the evidence in the case , which has spread to at least two other states after detectives discovered that one of the accused had traveled across state lines with the people found in the boiler room			1
police said wednesday that @entity37 , 47 - year - old @entity89 , 49 - year - old @entity90 and 32 - year - old @entity91 , @entity37 's daughter , may have been holding seven other people , including @entity37 's 19 - year - old niece , who showed signs of torture and abuse			1
authorities are also looking into whether some of the victims ' @entity100 checks had been stolen			0
@entity0 police commissioner @entity102 told @entity1 on monday that @entity37 had ids for about 50 people in her possession : " @entity100 information , power of attorney information , those kinds of things			0
" the case continued to develop friday when @entity1 uncovered new information that shows the @entity0 case was not the first time @entity37 has drawn scrutiny for possible @entity100 fraud			1
the @entity118 's @entity117 confirmed to @entity1 that it investigated @entity37 in 2009 for continuing to collect benefits for her roommate , @entity120 , after she died of acute meningitis			1
when the administration finally cut off benefits , @entity37 appeared at a @entity0 office seeking to have the benefits reinstated , the @entity117 said in a statement to @entity1			0
the money -- totaling less then $ 3,000 -- was repaid to the @entity118 , the inspector general said			0
the acknowledgment by the inspector general 's office has raised questions about why the @entity118 allowed @entity37 , a convicted murderer , to serve as a " representative payee " for a @entity100 recipient			2
under @entity118 policy , certain individuals convicted of criminal offenses are prohibited from serving as representative payees			0
the @entity118 has begun reviewing its handling of @entity37			0
after initially asking for questions for comment in writing from @entity1 , a spokeswoman for the administration declined to provide details of the @entity37 case , including whether @entity37 was the representative payee for any of the people found in captivity in @entity0			0
" we are very concerned about this situation			0
as this is an ongoing investigation , we ca n't provide you any details at this time , " spokeswoman @entity151 said			0
meanwhile , police in @entity156 , @entity157 , are taking a fresh look at @entity160 's death in light of the @entity0 case			1
according to police , @entity37 , who was caring for @entity160 , reported her death on november 13 , 2008			2
an autopsy determined the cause of death to be acute bacterial meningitis			0
the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy said a contributing factor in @entity160 's death was " cachexia of unknown origin , " or malnutrition			1
the manner of death is listed as " natural causes			0
" @entity156 police spokesman @entity178 said investigators have not yet decided to formally reopen the @entity160 case			2
the physician who conducted @entity160 's autopsy has reviewed the autopsy report and " has n't come to any other conclusions " about the cause of death , said @entity186 , spokesman for the @entity188 office of the @entity189			2
" we 're waiting to hear from the police if anything needs to be done by our department			0
" at the time of @entity160 's death , police say they did not know that @entity37 had served time for murder			1
the department did not conduct a murder investigation because the death was ruled natural , @entity178 said			0
@entity202 and @entity203 reported from @entity204			0
@entity205 reported from @entity206 .			0
