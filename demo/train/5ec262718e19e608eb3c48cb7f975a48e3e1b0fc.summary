@entity0 -- you could n't make it up : @entity4 granted temporary asylum in @entity6 -- a country with an unrivaled history of listening in to other people 's phone calls , bedroom consultations or private discussions -- as a " whistleblower " on the @entity16 @entity15 's legally sanctioned and publicly acknowledged activities			1
what is in it for @entity19 ? a bit of fun of course , for one thing			0
the @entity25 and now @entity6 habit has always been to answer criticisms of their conduct with the playground insult " and you 're another			0
" @entity4 in transit through @entity19 was a chance to posture as a defender of human rights in answer to @entity37 -- for them most woundingly @entity16 -- comments on the recent @entity6 record			1
there have also been @entity6 , concerned to work for human rights in their own country , more ready than ever to believe that the @entity44 has let them down in contesting renewed @entity47 pressure on civil society , and who have been willing to use @entity4 as a symbol of their commitment to universal values			2
but president @entity54 has no sympathy for turncoats ; and has no need for extra ways to signal his distaste for the @entity16			1
if he or the @entity6 @entity60 [ the @entity60 in @entity6 ] had supposed that @entity4 had valuable intelligence to offer they would have taken him in sooner , and they must have checked that out right away			2
as a contract worker reportedly determined at the outset to break his contract , @entity4 would not seem to be much of an intelligence catch			0
he would certainly not seem to @entity54 to be a hero			0
and the @entity6 president tried to mitigate the possible provision of asylum for @entity4 by the condition that he would not be permitted to harm @entity6 's @entity16 " partners " while under @entity19 's protection			1
so if @entity4 would not seem to @entity19 to be a likely long - or even short - term intelligence asset , or even what @entity77 would have described as a " useful idiot , " why have the @entity6 given him temporary asylum ? it seems probable to me that he has become an embarrassment , and because they could n't quite think of anything else to do with him			2
@entity4 has been allowed to stay at @entity87 in @entity19 -- or at least so it is said -- for too long simply to be handed over to @entity16 officials			2
if he was to have been sent to face trial in the @entity91 would naturally be questioned there as to whom he had seen in @entity19 , which might or might not be embarrassing to the @entity6			0
besides , there is no extradition treaty between @entity19 and @entity96 -- and @entity19 would have had to explain why they had agreed that @entity4 should be sent to the @entity16 after all this time			2
muddle is often a better explanation for the actions of any government than finely balanced policy making , and @entity6 is certainly no exception to that rule			1
@entity19 's handling of the @entity4 case has been hesitant , with no clear persons or institution directing affairs			0
giving him temporary asylum is not a solution			0
it merely puts the case into a different context , while making it harder for @entity19 to return him to face trial in the @entity16 , to send him off to another country , or to grant him permanent asylum in @entity6 for that matter			1
the @entity6 may hope that the @entity16 administration will tire of pressing its case , and that @entity4 can be conveniently forgotten			1
he will not of course be allowed -- if he is given permanent leave to stay in @entity6 , studies his @entity123 and @entity124 , and accepts one of the offers of marriage that he has had -- to take an active role as a human rights activist in his adopted country			0
but the @entity47 will have absorbed the lesson that the present @entity16 administration has been prepared over the years to turn a blind eye to @entity6 misbehavior for the sake of what it sees as realism in pursuing its immediate foreign policy interests			1
so why , @entity6 policy makers may think , make too much fuss over @entity4 ? there has been speculation of arranging a swap of @entity4 for a @entity6 refugee in the @entity16			1
i would prefer to think that too dishonorable for the @entity16 to contemplate			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0

president @entity54 has no sympathy for turncoats ; and has no need for ways to signal his distaste for @entity16 , *writes* @entity150
muddle is often a better explanation for the actions of any government than finely balanced policy making , he says
@entity150 : the @entity6 may hope that the @entity16 administration will tire of pressing its case
@entity6 policy makers may think : why make too much fuss over @entity4 ? says @entity150
