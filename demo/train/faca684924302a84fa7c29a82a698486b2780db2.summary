-- by a margin of 82 - 56 , the @entity1 voted friday to ban the death penalty in that state			1
the bill now goes to the desk of gov. @entity7 , who has pledged to sign it			1
" to govern is to choose , and at a time where we understand the things that actually work to reduce violent crime , when we understand how lives can be saved , we have a moral responsibility to do more of the things that work to save lives , " @entity7 said at a news conference			1
" we also have a moral responsibility to stop doing the things that are wasteful , and that are expensive , and do not work , and do not save lives , and that i would argue run contrary to the deeper principles that unite us as @entity23 , as @entity24 , and as human beings , " @entity7 added			1
@entity27 president @entity26 called the action " what courageous , principled political leadership looks like , " and archbishop of baltimore @entity29 said he applauded the general assembly " for choosing to meet evil not with evil , but with a justice worthy of our best nature			0
" @entity7 thanked both the @entity27 leadership and the state 's faith leaders for their support			1
@entity43 state attorney @entity42 , a prominent opponent of the bill , said eliminating capital punishment was unnecessary , since @entity47 's current policy is judicious and one of the " most restrictive in the country			1
" since a law was passed in 2009 , a judge can impose death in @entity47 only if one of three factors exists : dna evidence , a videotaped confession or a videotaped murder			2
@entity47 has executed only five people since 1976 , one of whom @entity42 prosecuted in the ' 80s			0
delegate @entity62 , a @entity64 @entity63 , said most state residents do n't want to see the death penalty abolished , but the governor and the " @entity68 " used political arm - twisting to push the bill through the legislature			1
but @entity62 said the death penalty move " does open a door " to petition , or challenge , such a law and bring it up for a referendum			2
@entity62 has set up @entity78 , a website devoted to pursuing petitions targeting laws " passed by a liberal - leaning legislature in @entity83 that simply do not make sense			0
" @entity62 says it 's too early to say how opponents of the ban will proceed if and when the bill is signed			2
he said it 's " excruciatingly difficult " to get a petition on the ballot , but members of mdpetitions.com will be consulted on what to do			0
@entity7 will make a case - by - case decision regarding the state 's five current death row inmates , according to a statement from the governor 's office			1
lt. gov. @entity101 called friday " a great day for @entity47			2
" " we saw a death penalty , a long history of racial bias , inaccuracies , injustices , and today , we decided that as a state we could do better			1
today is a victory for those who believe that fairness and truth and justice , and not retribution or bias , are fundamental to our core beliefs as @entity23 , " @entity101 said			0
@entity42 said confining the racial argument to the state of @entity47 , four studies on the issue have ascertained " no purposeful racial discrimination done on anyone in any of those cases			0
" and when it comes to the retribution argument , @entity42 said he believes in " the deterrence of one , " when a person is convicted of a heinous murder beyond a shadow of doubt , " every person will never be subjected to that person killing again			0
" @entity7 introduced the legislation in january			0
the @entity136 approved the bill last week			0
@entity47 will become the sixth state in as many years to replace capital punishment with life in prison without parole			1
