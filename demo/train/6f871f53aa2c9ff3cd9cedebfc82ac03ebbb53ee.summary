city dwellers will soon be able to make greener travel choices just by looking at their smartphone			1
the @entity5 smartphone app automatically detects whether its owner is traveling by rail , car or bus and calculates the emissions using an advanced algorithm			1
the app has been designed by @entity14 's @entity13 and they expect it to be available for download by the summer			2
they say the technology will also turn citizens into walking sensors , collecting detailed information about how people use cities			1
" we 're in the middle of this kind of technology revolution , " says director @entity24			0
" data allows you to make better decisions , either if you are the mayor or if you are the citizen			0
" thanks to smartphone technologies and embedded sensors on everyday objects , a wealth of real - time information can today be tracked , harnessed and shared with citizens instantly , helping urban people adapt their behavior and make better choices , says @entity24			2
in a nutshell , " hacking " the city 's data can help its inhabitants to be greener			2
it can also help city planners make better choices for the future , they say			1
capturing urban information -- figures on energy use , mobility , food and water consumption -- will allow planners to run simulations of potential scenarios and start asking " what if " questions			2
they say visualization will help them to deal with pressing problems like mass urbanization , aging infrastructure and carbon emissions			1
" it 's the capacity to play ' @entity72 ' for real , " says @entity66 , senior vice president for @entity67 and @entity68 at architecture firm @entity69 , referring to the popular computer game			0
" you can figure out what the algorithms are and then you can begin to say , ' well , if you want to add 100,000 people over the next 10 years , what 's the optimal way to do it ? ' " more from @entity80 : ' @entity79 ' buildings could inhale city carbon emissions moving toward models that show possible alternative scenarios can help avoid planning mistakes and optimize decisions about the ideal size and density level of a city , says @entity90 , senior manager for sustainability at technology group @entity92			1
" ultimately that 's the challenge here -- to figure out how many people , per square foot , per resource , to achieve a certain quality of life , that 's the ultimate algorithm , " she adds			0
there are already many groups that have started incorporating data visualizations and cloud - based simulations -- which offer users access to sophisticated tools from anywhere in the world -- as tools that could help tackle urban problems			1
in @entity111 , @entity112 , the @entity113 , a division of policy research organization @entity114 , has been exploring and building simulations to imagine different kinds of urban scenarios over a long period of time			2
the group has also been holding gaming workshops where interactive simulations help decision makers and users understand the implications of different energy choices , such as usage of solar power over coal or oil			0
the goal of such workshops is to come up with the ideal sustainable mix that will cover @entity112 's energy needs for the following years , organizers say			0
@entity135 , research manager for @entity136 at @entity138 - based @entity137 ( @entity137 ) says such moves are important because they allow city planners , decision makers and citizens to come together at an early stage to find solutions at different urban problems			1
" in particular , having conversations between the designers and the users of the system can be very important , " adds @entity135 , who prior to joining @entity137 worked with @entity114 in @entity112			0
floods , heat , migration : how extreme weather will transform cities in @entity155 , @entity156 , the " @entity158 " project aims to make citizens more aware about pollution levels by using real time data provided by the city 's authorities			1
the researchers have developed different interfaces to communicate the data , such as a web - based application that shows pollution levels and their evolution over time			0
they 're also interested in bringing the information into the public space -- for example , fitting the outside of buildings with large digital screens to reflect a certain color depending on the level of pollution , or developing small portable gadgets that show pollution levels nearby			0
@entity180 , creator of " in the air , " says the project aims to increase the public knowledge of an invisible urban ecosystem			0
it also wants " to generate awareness of the high levels of some of the components that exist in our cities and , finally , to enhance personal engagement of citizens that would end up in decision making and political action			0
" can we afford eco-cities ? @entity24 says that technology can radically change the way people interact with the urban environment and could allow them to get more engaged in decisions about where they live -- a key part of shaping environmentally friendly cities in the future			1
" building and managing cities have always been bottom - up collaborative processes -- some of this changed in the last couple of centuries with a top - down approach from city planners and decision - makers , " he adds			1
" technology ( will ) allow us to return to ( that in ) the future in a way			0

cities are a mass of data , if you know how to get at it -- that 's where technology comes in
tech experts are harnessing data to help plan better cities for the future mass urbanization and **co2** emissions
in the @entity238 a smartphone app turns *commuters* into walking **co2** emissions sensors
in @entity111 , gaming - style simulations allow city planners to see how their *decsions* could play out over five years
