last year it was houses in @entity4 , and on wednesday nature gobbled up some of the coolest and fastest cars to come off the assembly line			1
eight valuable ' vettes at @entity9 , @entity11 's @entity10 fell victim to a 40 - foot - wide , 20 - foot - deep sinkhole that opened up in the facility 's yellow @entity15 wing			1
the museum unofficially estimates it caused millions of dollars in damage			1
motion detectors alerted security that something was amiss shortly after 5:30 a.m. , said museum spokeswoman @entity22			1
an employee who first walked into the room " has been in shock all day , " she said			2
" when you go in there , it 's unreal , " said @entity22			1
" the hole is so big , it makes the @entity1 look like little @entity31 cars			1
" the news triggered a collective worldwide gasp from the @entity34			0
" i was shocked , " said @entity35 , 47 , a corvette owner since age 17			0
" we 're talking about iconic cars that have been around for years			1
" using remote - controlled drones , geologists and engineers from nearby @entity42 have already explored the sinkhole and determined that the @entity15 suffered no structural damage , @entity22 said			1
" there 's a cave down there , " she said , adding that the museum is only a short drive away from @entity47			1
the damaged portion of the museum will be closed indefinitely , but the rest of the facility will be open as usual on thursday , she said			1
the painful losses have been tallied : of the eight cars that fell , six were donated to the museum by @entity34 enthusiasts , and two are owned by the car 's maker , @entity60			1
here 's the museum 's list of cars that went down the hole : -- a 1962 " @entity34 " -- a 1984 @entity67 pace car -- a 2009 @entity68 " -- the 1992 white " 1 @entity69 " -- a 1993 ruby red " 40th @entity70 " -- a 2001 @entity72 -- the 2009 white " 1.5 @entity69 " -- a 1993 @entity73 the total value of the damaged cars is substantial , said museum executive director @entity76			1
almost all the cars have been removed from the room			1
they 've been setting up ramps to get the last one out , " said @entity22			0
that remaining @entity34 is suspended in a precarious position on a riser directly above the sinkhole			1
@entity35 , of the @entity84 , knows the museum well , having visited it at least six times			2
" there 's a sense of awe and you get a lump in your throat when you walk inside			2
under the @entity15 's recognizable red spire and towering vaulted 100 - foot high ceiling sits a round chamber that cradled rare vehicles , including @entity103 and @entity105 pace cars			1
the room feels like a cathedral			0
and for many enthusiasts , it is kind of the @entity110			0
it is home to more than 70 unique corvettes , including several prototypes and a unique 1983 model -- the only one in existence			0
only 43 1983 @entity1 were manufactured before @entity60 decided to scrap them and move on to the 1984 design			0
all were destroyed , except the one now housed at the museum			2
that car will likely go on display elsewhere in the museum , @entity22 said , but the others from the damaged dome will be placed in storage			1
let 's remember the @entity34 's rich tradition			2
this is the ultra-cool car driven by @entity128 in the 1970s tv series , " @entity130			0
" it also was the cherry ride that was good enough to be piloted by the dudes with the right stuff : @entity136 's @entity135 astronauts			2
" it 's the all - american car , " @entity35 said			1
" no matter where you go , people know it and love it			0
sometimes they 'll stare at it			0
other times they 'll wave			0
" you always remember your first car , and @entity35 is no different			0
for him it was a 1966 yellow @entity34 convertible			0
guess what ? he still has it			0
" that 's my baby , " he said			2
" that 's the one car i will not sell			2
" the sinkhole could n't have come at a worse time , as the museum prepares to celebrate its 20th annivesary and open a 184 - acre @entity157 in august			1
some 5,000 people are already pre-registered to attend the park 's grand opening			2
sinkholes at the @entity157 are n't really a concern , @entity22 said			0
several holes were found during construction and were made harmless , she said			0
" we want to move forward as soon as possible " , she said			0
" we want to start repairs and recovery			0
" sinkholes : common , costly and sometimes deadly			0
