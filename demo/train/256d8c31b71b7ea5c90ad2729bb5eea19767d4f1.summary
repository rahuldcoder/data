-- memo to @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , the @entity7 and all the other young singers and bands who are nominated for sunday night 's @entity10 : your real prize -- the most valuable and sustaining award of all -- may not become evident to you until 30 or so years have passed			1
you will be much older			2
but -- if you are lucky -- you will still get to be out on the road making music			2
many of sunday 's @entity10 nominees are enjoying the first wave of big success			2
it is understandable if they take for granted the packed concert venues and eye - popping paychecks			1
those may go away -- the newness of fame , the sold - out houses , the big money			1
but the joy of being allowed to do what they do will go on			2
i 've been doing some work while staying at a small hotel off a highway in southwestern @entity35			1
one winter day i was reading out on the pool deck , and there were some other people sitting around talking			0
they were n't young , by anyone 's definition			0
they did not seem like conventional businessmen or businesswomen on the road , or like retirees			0
there was a sense of nascent energy and contented anticipation in their bearing , of something good waiting for them straight ahead			0
a look completely devoid of grimness or fretfulness , an afternoon look that said the best part of the day was still to come			0
i would almost have bet what line of work they were in			0
i 'd seen that look before , many times			0
i could hear them talking			0
the @entity65 ( " @entity64 , " a no. 1 hit in 1961 )			0
@entity67 ( " i will follow him , " a no. 1 hit in 1963 )			0
@entity70 ( " @entity71 , " a top 10 hit in 1958 )			0
major singing stars from an earlier era of popular music , in town for a multi-act show that evening			1
it is the one sales job worth yearning for -- carrying that battered sample case of memorable music around the country , to unpack in front of a different appreciative audience every night			0
it 's quite a world			1
i was fortunate enough to learn its ins and outs during the 15 deliriously unlikely years i spent touring the @entity88 singing backup with @entity90 ( " @entity96 , " a no. 1 hit in 1963 ) and all the other great performers with whom we shared stages and dressing rooms and backstage buffets : @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , the @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , the @entity106 , the @entity107 , @entity108 , the @entity109 , @entity110 , the @entity111 , @entity112			1
... jukebox names whose fame was once as fresh and electric as that now being savored by sunday 's young @entity10 nominees			0
decades after that fame is new , the road may not be quite as glamorous , the crowds may not be quite as large			1
the hours of killing time before riding over to the hall , the putrid vending - machine meals on the run , the way - too - early - in - the - morning vans to the airport -- the dreary parts all become more than worth it when , for an hour or so , the singers can once again personally deliver a bit of happiness to the audiences who still adore their music			1
@entity135 : @entity137 ad revives iconic voice as the years go by , the whole thing may grow complicated -- band members come and go , they fight and feud , some quit , some die			1
there are times when it seems you ca n't tell the players without a scorecard -- the tokens at the highway hotel were , technically and contractually , @entity152 's @entity65 ( you do n't want to know the details )			1
one of their singers ( not @entity152 -- @entity156 ) was once @entity157 , a group that itself is still out on the road in a different configuration with a different @entity157 ( you do n't want to know )			2
but overriding all of this is a splendid truism : sometimes , if you have one big hit , it can take care of you for the rest of your life			2
it can be your life			2
sunday 's young @entity10 nominees may not imagine , 30 years down the line , still being on tour			0
but they -- the fortunate ones -- will come to learn something : they will grow old , but their hits never will -- once people first fall in love with those songs , the songs will mean something powerful and evocative to them for the rest of their lives			1
and as long as there are fairground grandstands on summer nights , as long as there are small - town ballparks with stages where the pitcher 's mound should be , the singers will get to keep delivering the goods			1
that is the hopeful news waiting , off in the distance , for those who will win @entity10 sunday , and for those who wo n't be chosen			0
on the morning after that pool - deck encounter in @entity35 i headed out for a walk , and in the parking lot of the hotel i saw one of the tokens loading his stage clothes into his car			1
his license plate read : @entity211 i said to him : " you sing lead on ' she cried , ' right ? " " every night , " he said , and drove off toward the next show			2
that 's the trophy , right there			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			1

@entity135 : grammy nominated acts should *remember* the real prize comes later in life
he says at a hotel he ran into a group of singing stars from an earlier era , in town for a show
he says the world of *post-fame* touring less glamorous for acts , but meaningful
@entity135 : acts grow old , but their hits never will and to fans , the songs are time - machine
