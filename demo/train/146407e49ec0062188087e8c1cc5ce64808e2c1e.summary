-- when assessing the lowest moments of @entity4 's presidency , outside observers might have gone with , oh , @entity5 , or that time when he realized he was going to have to bail out the @entity8 financial system , or when his approval rating dropped to 22 percent on his way out the door			1
but in his new memoir , " @entity20 , " @entity4 himself writes that the " worst moment " of his presidency -- his " all - time low " -- was when @entity14 declared during a @entity16 celebrity telethon that " @entity4 does not like black people			1
" now @entity14 has responded to that verdict			1
on the one hand , he seems uncertain his line deserves the place in history that @entity4 has just given him			1
but he also sees where @entity4 is coming from			1
the whole back - and - forth started when @entity4 's claim drew the attention of @entity30 , who sat down with @entity4 for an interview that will air the day before the book 's november 9 debut			1
and that in turn led to the following exchange , as relayed by @entity36 on @entity37 : @entity30 quotes from @entity4 's new book : " five years later i can barely write those words without feeling disgust			1
" @entity30 adds , " you go on : ' i faced a lot of criticism as president			0
i did n't like hearing people claim that i lied about @entity46 's weapons of mass destruction or cut taxes to benefit the rich			1
but the suggestion that i was racist because of the response to @entity16 represented an all - time low			2
' president @entity4 responds : " yeah			2
i still feel that way as you read those words			0
i felt ' em when i heard ' em , felt ' em when i wrote ' em , and i felt ' em when i 'm listening to ' em. @entity30 : " you say you told @entity56 at the time it was the worst moment of your presidency ? " @entity4 : " yes			1
my record was strong , i felt , when it came to race relations and giving people a chance			2
and it was a disgusting moment			0
" @entity30 : " i wonder if some people are going to read that , now that you 've written it , and they might give you some heat for that			2
and the reason is this " @entity4 [ interrupting ] : " do n't care			2
" @entity30 : " well , here 's the reason			0
you 're not saying that the worst moment in your presidency was watching the misery in @entity79			0
you 're saying it was when someone insulted you because of that			0
" @entity4 : " no , and i also make it clear that the misery in @entity79 affected me deeply as well			2
there 's a lot of tough moments in the book			0
and it was a disgusting moment , pure and simple			0
" for his part , @entity14 does not view his diss of then - president as the worst insult he 's ever dealt , ranking it below his more gratuitous put down of @entity94 at last year 's @entity95			1
during an appearance on @entity98 's show on @entity100 's @entity99 on tuesday night , he said of the @entity94 incident , " it 's an amazing , compelling situation			0
the situation is bigger to me than the @entity4 moment			2
it 's bigger than a lot of things			0
" but in a separate interview today -- this one with @entity109 's 97.9 @entity108 -- @entity14 expressed a sympathetic view of @entity4 's reaction			1
" well i definitely can understand the way he feels to be accused of being a racist in any way			1
because the same thing happened to me , " @entity14 told host @entity115 " with both situations , it was strictly a lack of compassion that @entity8 saw			2
you know , with him not rushing , not taking the time to rush down to @entity123			0
with me , it was the lack of compassion in cutting someone off in their moment			0
nonetheless , i think we 're all quick to pull a race card in @entity8			0
and now i 'm more open , and the poetic justice that i went through the same thing that he went through , and now i really more connect with him on a humanitarian level , because that next morning , when he felt that , i felt that same thing too			0
" like @entity4 , @entity14 is coming out of self - imposed exile to mount a comeback effort , with his built around the release of his next album , " @entity142 , " slated for release on november 22			1
" i do think i changed a lot " in the months since the @entity94 incident , he told @entity115 " i do think i 'm more compassionate , i 'm more sensitive to people 's emotions			1
" i needed that time off ... respect is something hard to earn and easy to lose , and i feel like i 'm on that path to getting that all back right now			0
" @entity4 , no doubt , would like to feel the same way , though it 's not clear he sees it necessary to express the same kind of contrition			1
