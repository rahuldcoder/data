-- a major missing piece threatens to hold up a security deal between @entity3 and the @entity4 : president @entity6 's signature			1
the @entity3 president told @entity4 national security adviser @entity8 monday that he is n't ready to approve the @entity9 yet and " outlined new conditions for signing the agreement , " according to a statement released by the @entity13			1
@entity14 told @entity6 that delaying the deal -- which would allow for the presence of a limited number of @entity4 troops beyond next year -- until after @entity3 's 2014 elections " is not viable , " the @entity13 said			1
" it would not provide the @entity4 and @entity21 allies the clarity necessary to plan for a potential post- 2014 military presence , " the statement said			0
" nor would it provide @entity3 with the certainty they deserve regarding their future , in the critical months preceding elections			0
" so what happens if @entity6 does n't sign it soon ? @entity4 and @entity21 troops could pull out of @entity3 earlier than expected			1
" the @entity4 would have no choice but to initiate planning for a post- 2014 future in which there would be no @entity4 or @entity21 troop presence in @entity3 , " the @entity13 said			0
on sunday a vast majority of 2,500 @entity3 elders voted to recommend the joint security agreement with the @entity4 and urged @entity6 to sign it before the end of the year			2
@entity6 had said he would follow their recommendation under one condition -- that @entity4 forces do not conduct house raids			0
" if @entity4 military forces conduct military operations on @entity3 homes even one more time , then there will be no @entity9 and we wo n't sign it , " @entity6 said on sunday			1
" they should give assurance about this to us before i sign it			0
" but then he moved the goal posts , refusing to sign until after the presidential election next spring			0
his last - minute decision to delay signing the pact was both classic @entity6 -- a tricky negotiator to the last -- and a breakaway move that provides political cover for any @entity4 officials who prefer the so - called zero option of leaving no @entity4 troops in @entity3			1
it 's a decision that could also have political implications for @entity6 in @entity3 , shoring up his anti-american credentials ahead of next year 's presidential election			2
@entity6 himself can not stand again for president under the current constitution , but he remains highly influential in @entity3 politics , whose entire cast he has helped shape since the @entity4 invasion in 2001			2
@entity74 , who ran against @entity6 in 2009 before dropping out of the race amid allegations of election fraud , told @entity0 's " @entity80 " on monday that political motivations are clouding @entity6 's approach			0
" these negotiations between @entity3 and the @entity4 are being delayed not because of the content of the @entity9 , " @entity74 said , " but primarily because of the personal feelings or personal interests of president @entity6			1
" @entity0 's @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 contributed to this report .			0

president @entity6 says he wo n't sign a security deal until after elections
