-- if we were hoping that the finally released -- but month - old -- preliminary report on the march 8 disappearance of @entity4 would help explain what happened , we were mostly disappointed			2
but the report , issued thursday and dated april 9 , does add new insights on snafus in crucial communication between air traffic control centers and @entity11 on the morning @entity4 disappeared			1
they are disturbing -- and put the competence of the airline 's operations center in question			1
indeed the brevity of the report ( five pages ) seems to show a @entity21 @entity20 still interested in sharing as little information as possible , especially when compared with the extensive detail in preliminary reports from other accidents , such as the loss of @entity27 in june 2009			1
what we do learn from this new report is that the airline told controllers -- who were already looking for @entity4 -- that everything was normal , delaying the realization that the plane was many hundreds of miles from where it was thought to be , and any attempts at finding it			1
in fact , it would be three hours and 52 minutes between the time that the controller in @entity45 , @entity46 , reported to air traffic control in @entity48 , @entity21 , that flight 370 had not contacted him as instructed , and the time that the @entity48 rescue center was activated			1
here 's what the report says happened : the @entity45 controller reported he saw the aircraft over the @entity57 navigational waypoint , a position still within @entity21 airspace where the flight had been instructed to contact @entity61 , but he did not have verbal contact			1
the controller further noted the observed " radar blip " disappeared over another waypoint along the aircraft 's route northeast of @entity57 , within @entity45 airspace and less than 100 miles from the southern tip of @entity46			0
after not hearing from the flight for 17 minutes after expected , the two controllers spent 20 minutes trying to contact the aircraft on " many " frequencies , the report says , and through relays from other aircraft in the area , as would be expected			1
then the controllers turned to the airline , and here things became odd			1
at 2:03 a.m. local time , @entity11 ' operation control center told the watch supervisor at @entity48 air traffic control that the flight was in @entity85 airspace			1
it was not planned to enter that airspace			0
the @entity45 controller , apparently skeptical of the airline 's information , requested confirmation			2
when queried , the airline said it was able to " exchange signals " with the flight			1
apparently still unaware that something was amiss , at 2:35 a.m. , nearly an hour after last contact with air traffic control and more than 30 minutes after reporting the airplane to be in @entity85 airspace , the airline informed @entity48 air traffic control that the airplane was " in normal condition based on signal download " and placed its position on course a few miles off eastern @entity46			1
the report makes no mention of whether the airline attempted to contact the airplane directly through satellite calls or data - link messages			1
at 03:30 a.m. , almost an hour after the airline 's last report put the aircraft in normal condition east of @entity46 , its operations center reported the position was based on a prediction of the flight 's progress , not its actual position			1
controllers expanded their contact attempts to include the @entity127 and @entity128 air traffic control centers , which also had no contact with the aircraft			2
controllers do n't instantly sound the alarm when an airplane does n't call them as expected			2
air traffic communications are not perfect in day - to - day operations , and the controller exchanges reflect that			2
a gap in radio coverage , a misdialed frequency and other everyday occurrences were good reason for the controllers not to react immediately			0
controllers took the expected actions in attempting to reach the flight on various frequencies and by other aircraft			2
a transponder , too , occasionally fails , and air traffic control will ask an airplane 's crew to reset it , but radio contact is required to do so			0
there are three phases of alerts in an air rescue situation , based on international protocols : the uncertainty phase , when no communication is received for 30 minutes after it should have been ; the alert phase , when attempts to contact the crew or inquiries to other relevant sources have failed to reveal any information ; and the distress phase , when further inquiries have failed to provide any information or when fuel on board is considered to be exhausted			0
clearly the misinformation provided by the airline that had controllers searching and attempting to contact the aircraft over much of @entity176 kept officials from realizing the airplane had never even reached the coast of @entity46			1
that conclusion was not drawn until 5:20 a.m. , after which the watch supervisor at @entity48 air traffic control activated the distress protocol			0
by then the airplane was likely somewhere well out over the @entity186			0
by then it had already been off air defense radar for hours , though it would take a replay of that data to see if it were ever on there in the first place			0
this scenario highlights some of the real - life difficulties associated with the current state of international air traffic control			0
we rely on electronic equipment on board the airplane reporting its position -- secondary radar ( using transponders ) and data - link communications			0
in remote oceanic areas , airplanes operate for many hours beyond any radar contact , where radio communication is also difficult			0
position and voice transmissions are periodic , not constant			0
for the modern air traffic control system , the current technology works well nearly 100 % of the time			0
however , when the electronics fail for whatever reason -- and there are many possibilities -- we are left with nothing			0
in the case of @entity27 , controllers looking for contact with the aircraft and the airline had similar communications issues			1
the investigation of that disappearance revealed a surprising lack of coordination between air traffic control agencies , their inability to contact each other and clarity on who should be initiating emergency protocols when contact is lost			0
in that case , too , there were erroneous reports -- that the flight was ok and nearing @entity242 airspace -- though this time from controllers			2
@entity244 had , just before then , become anxious about the error messages sent from the airplane -- which unbeknown to anyone had crashed more than four hours earlier north of @entity248			1
many controllers and agencies were asking about the flight , but no one had triggered the uncertainty , alert and distress phases of the process			2
details of these same processes in the @entity4 case remain unclear			0
the preliminary report on flight 370 concludes with one safety recommendation : to examine the safety benefits of introducing a standard for real - time tracking of commercial air transport aircraft			1
systems such as @entity267 -- essentially @entity268 -- currently offer that type of coverage over or near land , and @entity4 was so equipped			0
however , over remote areas the problem is more complex and expensive , and it still depends on whether or not the equipment on the plane is working .			0

@entity277 : report on flight 370 adds a few new insights on communications snafus
he says airline told controllers things were normal , delaying for hours attempts to find plane
@entity277 : *miscommunication* for nearly four hours calls airline competence into question
@entity277 : similar *confusion* in @entity244 *447* , but @entity21 officials still *withholding* info
