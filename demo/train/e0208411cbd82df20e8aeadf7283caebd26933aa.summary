" i 'm an orphan of @entity4 ; i grew up with the @entity6 generation , " he says			0
@entity7 : aiming for the @entity8 @entity9 was just one of many children left wide - eyed and inspired by the moon landings			1
but for him , they were a false start			0
" i had this enormous expectation that i would have an experience in space			2
it just did n't happen , " @entity9 says			1
man stepped on the moon , but only to prove a point			2
" we faltered , " he explains			0
" we did n't continue our operations on the moon ; we did n't go to @entity25			1
" now , @entity9 and his colleagues are bringing their childhood dreams to life , as part of the burgeoning @entity32 movement , which has sparked a renaissance in space exploration			1
the children of the moon landings have grown up : they now hold the positions of power to make their dreams come alive			1
" they want to make the world of ' @entity6 , ' of ' 2001 , ' and now ... they 're in charge of @entity43 , they 're in charge of the private companies , and they 're making it happen , " he explains			0
@entity9 says his path to the stars was " inevitable			1
" inspired by science fiction authors like his friend , @entity50 , visionaries like @entity53 and movies like " 2001 : a @entity66 , " he studied aerospace and industrial engineering at @entity58 , then physics and astronomy at the @entity61 , before moving to @entity62 to study space science , where he became special assistant to @entity53			1
now , @entity9 is the ringleader behind @entity67 , a company formed on the @entity68 to pursue commercial ventures on the moon			1

but the @entity82 is not @entity9 ' only goal			1

" we believe that beyond the prize , there 's actually ongoing commerce on the surface of the moon , " he reveals			0
innovation and collaboration , both important drivers in the @entity67 team , are the key to humanity 's future , believes @entity9			2
" @entity66 , by its nature , is an international endeavour , " he says			0
" every space program will be successful based on the amount of international cooperation it 's able to achieve			0
" with that in mind , in 1987 he founded the @entity110 , which educates students from all over the world in space technology			0
" we 're creating a universal planetary culture looking on space as an achievement and a goal for all humanity			0
" for now , @entity9 ' sights are set on the moon			1
" the @entity123 has certainly captivated my enthusiasm and interest , and i would certainly like to win that , " he says			0

he confesses , " if somebody was going to offer an @entity82 for @entity25 , i 'd be going for that ... "			1

as a *boy* , @entity9 was inspired by the moon landings and science fiction
but his childhood expectations failed to be realized as the space race cooled
now @entity9 and the @entity32 movement have renewed interest in space
@entity9 is aiming for the moon -- and confesses @entity25 is *tempting* ...
