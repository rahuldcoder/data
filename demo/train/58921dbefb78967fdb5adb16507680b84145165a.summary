-- when you click on nude pictures of celebrities or @entity5 videos of beheadings , you 're part of the problem			1
at the very least , you 're complicit in the moral crime committed by those who post such pictures or videos			2
at worst , you 're actively perpetuating the incentives behind posting such things in the first place			0
want to be a responsible and considerate human being ? then for crying out loud , do n't click on those things ! this week hackers released what they say are nude pictures of celebrity women , including @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
these photos came on the heels of other leaked nude photos , also of celebrity women , which must have gotten enough attention to make the hackers want to do it again			1
opinion : who 's at fault over nude photo hack ? a week before , @entity5 posted another video claiming to show the beheading of a @entity38 aid worker			1
the video -- mind you , not just its existence but people actually seeing it -- fueled the same sort of revenge mindset in @entity38 that previous such videos fueled in the @entity47			0
president @entity48 himself has noted that the videos in which @entity5 beheads @entity47 journalists @entity53 and @entity55 " resulted in the @entity47 public 's quickly backing military action			1
" yesterday , another such video was posted of @entity5 supporters in @entity58 beheading a @entity60 tourist			2
media outlets have struggled with whether to broadcast photos and videos that are on the one hand newsworthy -- and incidentally , salacious and thus , traffic - generating -- but on the other hand may perpetuate the harm or offense committed in the first place			1
for instance , @entity0 did n't air the @entity53 video , opting instead to show only a few images and audio			0
some news organizations , however , were less restrained			0
speaking with @entity75 on " @entity76 " about the latest @entity5 video showing @entity38 journalist @entity78 speaking in captivity , @entity81 managing director @entity80 said , " we know that @entity5 wanted us to show it			2
and if we 're in a situation where @entity5 wants us to show anything , we should think really carefully about any way we can avoid doing that			1
" let that sink in for a moment : @entity5 wants you to watch those videos			2
the hackers who stole the celebrity pictures want you to look at them			0
when you click , you 're doing precisely what the bad guys want you to do			2
opinion : will @entity5 brutality backfire ? this summer , i gave a @entity101 about the changing landscape of @entity47 media and how we the consumers are becoming the new editors			1
because online traffic performance drives media in the digital age , our clicks matter more than ever before			1
i used to think writing essays like this or going on television is a public act of making media , but that browsing the web at home , clicking on this and that , is a private act of consuming media			0
clicking is a public act of making media because it feeds what gets attention			0
i imagine that most @entity47 would n't buy things they knew had been stolen out of someone else 's home			0
is n't clicking on stolen photos the same thing ? or worse ? the @entity130 's @entity129 writes that clicking on or sharing stolen celebrity nude photos is " an act of sexual violation " that in effect perpetuates the abuse of the theft in the first place			1
the @entity139 's @entity138 writes that some actively spreading the pictures online feel so entitled to violate these celebrity women 's privacy that they imply the celebrities might have leaked the pictures themselves -- as though all the slut - shaming and misogyny would be an enjoyable pr boost			2
opinion : keep nude photos offline ? here 's another idea let 's be clear , even if you are n't the scuz - bucket making rape jokes in chat rooms , just by curiously clicking on these nude celebrity pictures you 're giving the hackers attention and the publishers traffic			1
you 're basically encouraging them to keep doing it			2
by the same token , i know most @entity47 would never want to support or encourage the murderous @entity5 extremists			0
but does public obsession with and outrage around @entity5 beheading videos do just that ? analyzing the political and psychological motives for beheadings , the @entity170 's @entity169 writes , " clearly the terrorists relish the horror beheading evokes in @entity47 and other @entity177 democracies			1
" beheading @entity47 naturally provokes that very human reaction			0
still , if we had only heard about @entity53 and @entity55 being beheaded , would it have generated the same attention and outrage ? or was it the videos , or even just the still images from the videos , that incited and inflamed our anger ? according to a recent @entity190 / @entity189 poll , in 2013 , 78 % of @entity47 had heard about the @entity193 's @entity192 decision , 77 % of @entity47 were aware of the debt ceiling fight in @entity195 , and 79 % of @entity47 had heard about the alleged use of chemical weapons by @entity199 's regime in @entity200			0
but fully 94 % of @entity47 were aware that @entity5 killed @entity53			0
how much is the tail of these deeply vile and upsetting videos wagging the dog of our emotions and prompting us to military action ? in my @entity101 , i said that clicking on a train wreck " just pours gasoline on it and makes it worse			0
" the result ? " our whole culture gets burned			0
" if in our new media - driven universe , what gets the most clicks wins , " we have to shape the world we want with our clicks			0
" the good news there is that you -- yes you -- have the power as just one individual to decide what we see more of or what we see less of in the media ; to discourage disgusting videos and pictures and encourage positive , productive media coverage			1
that is an incredible and important power			1

@entity235 : do n't click on nude photos of celebrities or @entity5 videos of beheadings
@entity235 : when you click on those thing , you 're encouraging the hackers and terrorists
she says the new *stories* we click on affect media coverage , which want online traffic
@entity235 : consumers have an important power - use it wisely , click responsibly
