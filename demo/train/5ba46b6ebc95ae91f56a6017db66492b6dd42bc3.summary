-- @entity1 has seen a jarring last - minute twist in the race for mayor , in which the current mayor , @entity5 , may have given a crucial boost to the person he would probably least like to see succeed him in @entity9			1
@entity10 , who surged into the lead among the democrats running for mayor , has been campaigning for months as a progressive bent on governing in a way that alters or reverses many of @entity18 's cherished policies -- starting with @entity10 's proposal to raise taxes on households earning $ 500,000 or more per year			1
@entity22 , who is married to a black woman , has also made a series of campaign ads that include his biracial teenage children			0
@entity5 , in a magazine interview , dismissed @entity10 's campaign as " class warfare and racist			1
" asked to explain the inflammatory charge , @entity5 said @entity10 is " making an appeal using his family to gain support			1
i think it 's pretty obvious to anyone watching what he 's been doing			0
i do not think he himself is racist			0
it 's comparable to me pointing out i 'm @entity40 in attracting the @entity40 vote			0
" the comment is , on its face , questionable			0
click here and look at the videos for yourself			0
if @entity10 is using his telegenic family to good effect , it 's no different from what candidates have been doing for centuries			1
if the comment was intended to halt @entity10 's momentum , it surely failed -- and appears to have backfired -- with the most relevant audience , the active @entity58 base likely to turn out on primary day			1
in fact , within hours of publication of the mayor 's remarks , @entity10 was using the dust - up as part of a fund - raising appeal to supporters			1
gov. @entity68 sided with @entity10 as well			2
" the comments that were reported clearly are out of line and have no place in our political discourse , " @entity68 told reporters			0
" there 's plenty of substantive issues to be discussing without raising unnecessary and inflammatory topics			0
" the dust - up is more than just an ill - timed misstatement by @entity18			1
it may also illustrate his frustration and impatience after months of bashing by the @entity58 mayoral candidates			0
a self - made billionaire who is the wealthiest person in @entity1 , @entity18 does not suffer fools gladly			1
" @entity88 has a few choice words for you if he does n't like your policy idea , but his words of choice are usually variations of dumb and stupid , " the @entity95 noted earlier this year			0
" mayor @entity5 has the unlovely habit of hearing all sides of a question -- for about 60 seconds , when he trots out his personal thought - stopper : ' let 's get serious , ' " columnist @entity96 noted in 2005			1
" this means that he is serious , you are not			0
he is smart , you are dumb			0
he has billions , you do not			0
" keep in mind that this bracing assessment by @entity96 comes from a nationally known conservative who was explaining why he intended to vote for @entity18			2
this is not a warm and cuddly mayor			0
but @entity1 are looking for someone who is more empathetic : in a recent poll , 65 % of @entity1 said they want the city to move in a different direction			2
and a comparable percentage said that an endorsement from @entity18 would have no effect or make them less likely to support a candidate			2
in addition to swallowing that tough reality , @entity18 has recently encountered setbacks that foreshadow the dropping of the final curtain on his administration at the end of the year			2
over @entity18 's strenuous objections , federal courts have appointed monitors to oversee hiring in the city 's fire department ( which is currently 3.4 % black ) and to reduce and restructure the police department 's use of stop - and - frisk tactics			1
the normally toothless @entity136 overrode two @entity18 vetoes to create an @entity139 inspector general and to make it easier for citizens to sue if they think the police have illegally profiled them			2
@entity22 championed virtually all of the lawsuits and legislation that led to additional oversight of @entity18 's agencies , and specifically campaigned on his opposition to @entity18			1
and @entity10 's call to tax the city 's wealthy -- with the proceeds used to pay for pre-kindergarten and afterschool programs for children -- is anathema to the mayor , who called the plan " about as dumb a policy as anyone could think of			1
" that sort of dismissive comment means one thing coming from a billionaire at the helm of city government			2
but if , as expected , @entity10 finishes first in the @entity58 primary on tuesday , it will signal something else entirely : the tolling of the bell making clear that the 12 - year reign of @entity5 is , unmistakably , coming to a close			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			0

@entity174 : in interview @entity1 mayor @entity5 called @entity10 's campaign " racist "
his comment that @entity10 using mixed - race family in campaign backfired , @entity180 says
he says @entity10 campaigns to upend many @entity18 policies , mayor likely chafing at this
louis : if @entity10 wins primary , it will signal @entity18 's 12 - year tenure truly coming to close
