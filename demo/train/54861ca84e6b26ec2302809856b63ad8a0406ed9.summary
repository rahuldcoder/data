-- with every passing day , the wait for the kidnapped @entity3 girls gets more agonizing			1
@entity4 seized the nearly 300 schoolgirls and vanished into a dense forest last month			1
their abduction sparked a global movement as throngs took to the streets demanding their rescue			1
officials say 276 girls remain missing			1
here 's why their rescue is a risky , complicated effort			2
it 's been more than three weeks the ticking clock could mean the girls are getting farther away			1
militants herded the girls out of bed on april 14 at a school in @entity23 in northern @entity3			1
a few escaped and shared harrowing tales of fleeing a nearby forest			2
at the time , relatives roaming through the forest searching for the girls said there were no signs of soldiers in the area considered a militant hideout			1
" in a hostage situation , time is of the essence , " said @entity36 rear adm. @entity35			0
" we lost some time			0
" missing girls likely separated @entity35 said the missing girls may have been broken up into smaller groups and taken out of the country			1
local residents say they 've heard reports of cars filled with girls headed to neighboring @entity48			1
the forest is near the @entity48 border , which is porous and does n't require much to pass through			1
in some cases , a simple monetary bribe will get you waved into neighboring nations , in this case a list that includes @entity57 and @entity58			0
" the search must be in @entity58 , @entity48 and @entity57 to see if we can find information , " said @entity59 , a former @entity61 prime minister and the @entity63 's special envoy for global education			0
location and number of hostages are factors the girls ' abduction occurred in an area where the government does n't have a firm grip			1
the school is about 600 miles from the capital of @entity79			1
and the large number of hostages means airstrikes may not be an option because they can kill captives			0
a ground assault is n't a great option either -- not when it is done in unfamiliar terrain against entrenched , well - armed fighters			2
@entity3 military is n't the most trustworthy hours after the girls went missing , the @entity3 military faced criticism for its handling of the kidnapping			1
it said it had rescued all but eight of the girls , a claim it later recanted after their parents said most remained missing			2
ensuing attacks have shown that the security forces do n't have the capability to protect civilians , which will make many think twice before providing intelligence			2
it 's also ill - equipped numerous attacks in recent years make it clear that @entity3 does not have the most sophisticated programs to battle terrorism			0
in addition , it 's lacking in intelligence gathering , a crucial element in the search for the missing girls			2
this has prompted the @entity117 , @entity61 , @entity118 and a host of other nations to step in to fill the gap			0
the @entity117 offer to help includes the creation of a " coordination cell " to provide intelligence , investigations and hostage negotiation expertise , the @entity122 said			0
@entity4 beheads negotiators while negotiations may be an option in some hostage crises , this case may not be so clear cut			1
rights groups have accused @entity3 of using heavy - handed tactics such as illegal searches , torture and extrajudicial killings to crack down on the militants			2
as a result , it has eroded trust between the two sides , prompting @entity4 leader @entity146 to say he " will not enter a truce with infidels , " @entity117 lawmakers said last year			1
@entity4 members who try to negotiate with the government get beheaded			1
" reports of beheadings seem to go up when there are talks of negotiation			0
it is plausible that many of these beheadings , which rose in frequency in early 2012 , are purges of moderate members who have complained or attempted to negotiate , " @entity117 lawmakers said			2
if there are negotiations going on , they have not yielded results so far			0
its members are always on the move the militants do n't sit still for long , making them even more elusive			1
members hop from one location to another to avoid an intensified government crackdown			2
they leave their wives behind when they scamper into hideouts deep into forests , forcing the girls and women kidnapped to perform chores and sexual services			1
@entity146 is a cold , ruthless monster the @entity4 leader took credit this week for the @entity23 kidnapping			1
" i abducted your girls , " he taunted with a chilling smile			2
" there is a market for selling humans			0
@entity190 says i should sell			0
he commands me to sell			0
" he operates in the shadows , leaving his underlings to orchestrate his repulsive mandates			0
and they have been busy			0
days after his video surfaced , details emerged of another abduction of eight girls between ages 12 and 15 on sunday night in the northeast			1
and a grisly assault on a local village left hundreds of people dead			0
the bounty on his head may not help much @entity146 has been on the @entity117 radar since he came to power five years ago			0
the @entity117 offered a reward of up to $ 7 million for information leading to his location			0
but that may not yield immediate results			0
" @entity215 warlord @entity214 's had a bounty for years			0
@entity217 was not given up because of the $ 25 million bounty			0
and who knows whether this will be the case , " said @entity219 , @entity0 's chief international correspondent			0
310 people killed in latest @entity4 attack while hundreds of girls remain missing @entity225 to @entity0 : kidnapped @entity3 girls are ' my sisters ' @entity3 missing girls : families sleep in the bushes , fearing more attacks			1

militants kidnapped the 276 girls last month at a school in @entity23
in the past , @entity4 leader has said he *'ll* not negotiate with " infidels "
the girls ' abduction occurred in an area where the government does n't have a firm grip
