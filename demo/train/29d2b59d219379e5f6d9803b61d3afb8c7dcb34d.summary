-- @entity1 is representing the @entity2 at the @entity3 in pursuit of the gold medal in women 's kayaking			1
but while she battles for the gold , @entity1 is fighting another battle : with @entity11 's disease , one of the two most common inflammatory bowel diseases , according to the @entity14			1
in a recent @entity16 interview , @entity1 talked openly about her illness			2
one of the first things she did after being diagnosed in 2003 , she said , was " take to the @entity18 and library to read about the disease			0
" she had to -- like many people , she had heard of @entity11 's disease but had little understanding of it			1
more than 1 million people currently suffer from @entity11 's disease , and thousands more are diagnosed each year			1
however , many suffer in silence , as the effects of @entity11 's are often not openly discussed			1
about seven of every 100,000 people in the @entity2 are diagnosed , most of them between the ages of 15 and 30 , according to the @entity11			1
there is no cure for the chronic condition			0
@entity11 's disease is named after dr. @entity37 who , along with two colleagues , recognized and documented the symptoms in 1932			1
those diagnosed with it include some well - known personalities such as former president @entity44 ; @entity45 , guitarist for @entity47 ; former @entity49 @entity48 ; and actress @entity50			2
@entity11 's disease is an autoimmune disease of the digestive tract that most often affects the small or large intestines , and sometimes both			1
according to the @entity14 , @entity11 's is " a condition of chronic inflammation potentially involving any location of the gastrointestinal tract , but it frequently affects the end of the small bowel and the beginning of the large bowel			1
in crohn 's disease , all layers of the intestine may be involved and there can be normal healthy bowel between patches of diseased bowel			0
" in a healthy body , the immune system creates an infection - fighting protein called tumor necrosis factor			0
when @entity11 's disease is present , @entity73 is produced in excess as the immune system mistakenly identifies healthy bacteria as a foreign presence			1
this causes the body to launch an attack and begin fighting the excess @entity73 , which leads to more inflammation , which results in more tnf			0
as this internal battle takes place , it causes severe pain , abdominal swelling , cramping , bleeding , diarrhea and deterioration of the affected portion of the intestinal tract			0
dr. @entity92 , a board - certified colon and rectal surgeon with the @entity95 and @entity96 , is all too familiar with the effects of @entity11 's on patients			1
" @entity11 's is a chronic , lifelong disease for which there is no cure , " he said			1
" because its cause is unknown , and because flare - ups happen without warning , those diagnosed with @entity11 's face a life of challenges and uncertainties			1
" for some , treatment will bring about favorable results			0
for others , treatment will have little or no effect			0
each patient is different , and treatment is a trial - and - error process			0
the only certainty is that it is a lifelong battle			0
" the cause of @entity11 's is not known , but the @entity121 notes that it can run in families and have a genetic component			1
unknown triggers can also be caused by the environment			0
early treatments for @entity11 's disease primarily centered on steroid drugs such as prednisone , which relieved the inflammation but did little more			1
in recent years , there has been significant success in treating symptoms , and in some cases bringing about remission , with the use of newer @entity138 drugs such as @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			0
however , they too have their own set of complications and side effects			0
the man who could n't eat a diagnosis of @entity11 's disease often brings more questions than answers , and patients can face a long list of ever - changing complications			1
in addition to pain , bleeding and bowel changes , they have difficulty absorbing nutrition and often deal with malnourishment , anemia and crippling fatigue			0
left untreated , @entity11 's spreads throughout the intestinal tract , causing more severe symptoms and a bleaker prognosis			1
the disease itself is not classified as a terminal illness , but the complications that arise from it can sometimes be life - threatening			0
@entity11 's patients face another stark reality : in spite of their and their doctor 's best efforts , the disease can stop responding to medication			1
when that happens , surgery becomes a last resort			0
according to the @entity11 , about 70 % of @entity11 's sufferers eventually require surgery			2
about 30 % of patients who have surgery for @entity11 's disease experience a recurrence of their symptoms within three years , and up to 60 % will have a recurrence within 10 years			1
the two most common surgeries for @entity11 's disease are bowel resection surgery , which involves removal of the deteriorated portion of intestine , and fistula repair surgery			2
fistulas can result from @entity11 's disease permeating the intestinal wall , leaving an opening or " hole " in the intestinal tract			2
this is one of the most serious complications of @entity11 's			1
developing infection during the healing process is not uncommon , and often leads to temporary ostomies and lengthy periods of intravenous feeding			0
could i have inflammatory bowel disease ? @entity11 's will always bring about a change in the quality of life , but recent studies are painting a picture for a more hopeful future			2
medical research funding is critical , and raising funds presents a challenge in the current economic environment			0
" it 's not a matter of if we find cures ; it 's a matter of when , and that 's determined by available funding , " said @entity219 , president of the @entity11			2
the foundation is the largest voluntary nonprofit health organization dedicated to finding cures for inflammatory bowel diseases , a classification that includes @entity11 's and colitis			2
it is one source of funding for studies across the country and has chapters nationwide			0
the foundation 's website allows patients to become part of online study groups by sharing their symptoms , progress and complications			2
this allows the patient to develop an understanding of his or her individual case , and allows the foundation to have access to more patient histories for use in its research			0
living with @entity11 's disease : ' today i will fight again '			2

more than 1 million people in the @entity2 have @entity11 's
patients face ever - changing complications
