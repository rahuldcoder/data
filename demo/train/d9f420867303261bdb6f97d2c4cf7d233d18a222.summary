-- @entity1 has announced its surface tablets , due out late this year , at a time when security is a growing concern for users of mobile devices			1
and when most consumers think security , @entity1 probably is n't the first brand to spring to mind			1
but are surface tablets likely to be any more or less secure than the @entity12 or @entity14 tablets ? that could depend on which surface model you 're talking about			1
but in general , these devices probably wo n't pose any significant additional security risks to mobile users			1
@entity1 said there will be two versions of @entity23			2
the first , due out this fall , will run the not - yet - released @entity25 operating system -- a tablet - based version of the @entity27 , which will only run apps adapted for @entity1 's tile - based " @entity29 " user interface			2
so far , @entity1 has offered few hardcore details about this system			2
but the tech news site @entity34 offered a good rundown of what to expect from @entity25 the higher - end second surface tablet , probably due out a few months later , will run the full @entity39 operating system			2
this os also has not yet been released , but a consumer preview has been available for several months			0
at a conference tuesday , @entity42 , senior director of development for @entity46 's @entity45 line of security software , explained that so far it 's hard to say exactly what types of security concerns @entity25 devices might pose			1
but security experts know a fair bit about @entity39			0
" it 's a lot like the current desktop version of @entity59 we have today , so its security issues will probably be very similar , " he said			0
" @entity1 raised the security bar considerably a few years ago when they introduced @entity66 , " @entity42 added , referring to software has since been rebranded as @entity63			1
it offers a level of protection against threats such as spyware , botnets , phishing attacks , websites that install malicious code and more			0
" we know that @entity39 will include defender , " @entity42 said			0
the " bad guys " who develop malware and other security threats pay close attention to the level of security built into @entity1 products , since @entity59 remains the most popular computer operating system in the world			1
and right now , those bad guys are busily updating their code , @entity42 said			0
hackers today can already exploit @entity90 and soon should be able to exploit @entity59 8 , he said			0
one key difference in @entity39 is that it 's two operating systems in one			0
it offers a regular @entity59 desktop interface as well as @entity1 's newer " @entity29 " interface -- the tile - based design that 's the hallmark of @entity27			2
in contrast , the first model of the surface tablet ( @entity25 only ) will only offer the @entity29 interface , so it wo n't be able to run the full versions of many desktop apps popular with @entity59 users , such as @entity106			1
" from a security perspective , we expect this device to be about the same as what we see with current mobile operating systems such as @entity14 and @entity113 , " @entity42 said			2
according to @entity114 , @entity25 might offer some security advantages for large organizations : " @entity1 can perform a type of network access control on @entity25 devices as a way to protect corporate networks from harm ... making them a cut above @entity12 and @entity14 tablets in this regard			1
" if you 're concerned about security , you can purchase extra security software such as @entity45 or other products from various vendors , many of which have mobile apps			2
for the @entity39 version of @entity23 , such software could provide additional protection above what @entity63 offers			0
in the big picture for mobile , so far the vast majority of mobile security threats are malware that target @entity14 devices			1
the open nature of the @entity14 and the ease with which @entity14 apps can be distributed through the @entity149 store make this possible			0
so users of @entity14 devices , including tablets , should be especially careful of security risks			1
despite popular opinion that @entity157 devices are inherently more secure and despite ongoing @entity59 security problems such as the pernicious @entity160 worm , @entity1 may actually be better at security overall than @entity157			1
security expert @entity162 recently told @entity163 that @entity157 is " 10 years behind @entity1 in terms of security			1
" @entity162 was referring to @entity167 computers , but his comments might also apply to iphones and @entity12			0
simply because @entity59 has long been the world 's most popular computer operating system by a long shot , it has been a far more attractive target for bad guys seeking to exploit security holes			0
thus @entity1 has far more experience with spotting , combating and communicating about security issues			1
whether this expertise ends up making these new @entity59 tablets extra secure remains to be seen			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity182 .			0

@entity1 announced its surface tablets this week
security is a growing concern for users of mobile devices
surface models probably wo n't pose any significant additional security risks to mobile users
one expert says @entity1 is *ahead* of @entity157 in security
