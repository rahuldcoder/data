-- " get over there , girl , ca n't you read ? stand in this line , " the customs agent , armed with a machine gun , barked at me while pointing her finger in my face			2
the female afrikaans custom agent was apparently upset that i was n't moving along quickly enough			2
it was clear that she did n't like the looks of me because she refused to look me in the eye or answer my questions about where to go next			2
" girl , who does she think she is talking to ? " i asked my travel companion who was white and male			2
" i do n't have to take that kind of rudeness from anyone			2
" but he begged me to keep my opinions to myself before i got arrested or worse			2
you see , it was 1992 and i had just landed in @entity25			1
and while @entity27 may have been freed from prison in 1990 after 27 years , and the system of racial separation of apartheid was beginning to be dismantled with the opening of beaches and other public places by then - president @entity35 , the reality was that black people had a long way to go			1
@entity38 were not treated with any type of dignity or equality			2
the customs agent was holding on to the old ways and she made it clear			2
back home while studying at @entity46 , i 'd adorned myself head to toe in the colors of the @entity50 ( black , green and gold ) and joined the student protests against apartheid			2
we demanded that the university divest its holdings from all corporations that were doing business in @entity25 , companies like @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
students of all races and backgrounds around the world had joined the anti-apartheid movement			0
shantytowns were erected , hunger strikes were begun and for the first time in my young life , i began to think about my generation 's collective power to force change			0
@entity77 ! " were our battle cries back then			0
honestly , i did n't really know much about @entity25 and had just begun to learn about @entity27 , who is revered today but was rarely mentioned in a favorable light back then			1
the story of his nation was never taught in any of my world history classes			0
after reading about his life and studying the history of @entity25 , " @entity27 " became a hero and symbol of freedom for me and many of my generation			1
we were hungry for a courageous leader of our own , a civil rights movement of our own and a way to contribute our voices to the fight for freedom against the greedy , consumer - driven politics of the 1980s			0
armed with a journalism degree and a desire to eradicate injustice , i set out to change the world			0
but i soon found out that it was @entity104 ve to set such a lofty goal , considering i did n't truly understand anything about the world except what i 'd read in the newspapers			0
and i admit , protesting in the safe confines of elite college campuses is n't exactly radical			0
my @entity25 friends , who appreciated my good intentions , challenged me to dig deeper to understand their world			1
it was not enough , they said , to don the colors of the @entity50 and wave protest signs and rant against the headlines			0
" if you really want to know our country and our struggle , go see it for yourself			0
meet our people , live in our townships , not a fake @entity126 , and learn about the rich , vibrant culture of @entity25			1
" and that 's exactly what i did , much to the chagrin of my family , who feared that i might be killed in a protest , catch a horrible disease , or worse -- get trampled by an elephant			0
we were not a worldly family back then			0
for me , traveling to @entity25 in the early 1990s before apartheid was fully dismantled was an eye - opening experience			1
the country at the time was a paradox of extremes -- a stunningly beautiful nation with an overabundance of natural resources			0
but the wealth that was generated was only benefiting the whites while the specter of civil war loomed			0
the white people were anxious and hostile at the quickly changing balance of power and threatened to flee the country , taking their wealth and corporations with them			0
@entity38 were hopeful after the release of @entity27 but frustrated with what they saw as the slow pace of change			1
the chains of apartheid were still a very big part of their everyday lives			0
for me , living there in the townships with families -- both wealthy and poor -- of my @entity25 friends changed my life and my perception of who i was as a black woman , and as a citizen of the world who had a responsibility to stand up to injustice			1
by experiencing their lives up close , i learned how much we had in common -- shared traditions and family stories , a deep love of music and even many family recipes			0
i was strengthened by the connection between my @entity25 ancestors and my @entity188 relatives ; they had the strength to survive against extreme oppression and the ingenuity and intelligence to prosper			1
in @entity25 , i met courageous journalists who had risked their lives and lived in daily fear because they dared to speak out against apartheid			1
they taught me more about journalism ethics and reporting than any college course could			0
and i met loving mothers and young women and men who refused to let generations of oppression crush their determination to fight for freedom , or their joy for the small blessings in life			0
and i learned that though there are times when the best battle strategy is take up arms to fight your enemies , it is wiser in the long run to show grace in the face of hatred			1
above all , @entity27 showed the world that we can never be completely free until we free ourselves of hatred			1
when @entity27 was elected president in 1994 , i wept with happiness for my newly found brothers and sisters			1
but i was also envious that their nation had come so far and united together to accomplish what i could never imagine in my lifetime in the @entity188 -- a black president			1
( well , i wrong on that one			0
) so i say goodbye to @entity27 and celebrate his life with the joyous lyrics of " black president " by @entity237 , a nationwide hit that i first heard in @entity25 at a celebration party after @entity27 's election			1
we danced out hearts out that night for our first black president , singing : " let us rejoice for our president			1
let us sing for our president			2
let us pray for our president			2
let us sing , let us dance			0
for @entity27 , @entity27 's freedom			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			1

@entity248 : i visited @entity25 after @entity27 was freed from jail
@entity252 : @entity253 was starting to be dismantled , but blacks had a long way to go
when @entity27 became president , she wondered if @entity188 would have a black president
@entity252 : @entity27 showed us that we can never be free until we free ourselves of hatred
