@entity0 , @entity1 -- a three - judge panel will begin hearing testimony monday in @entity7 @entity6 's post-election legal challenge for the @entity9 seat			1
@entity6 will argue many votes were not recounted properly in his bid for re-election to the @entity9			1
an election - night count showed @entity6 , who was the incumbent senator from @entity1 , ahead by a few hundred votes			2
a recount handed victory to his opponent , democrat @entity18 , by 225 votes			1
about 3 million ballots were cast in the race			1
" we have a good shot at this , and so i proceed with that in mind , " @entity6 said last week , calling @entity18 's lead " artificial			1
" to aid in his battle , @entity6 has retained @entity29 , the lawyer who led the @entity31 recount efforts for the @entity7 side during the disputed presidential election in 2000			1
@entity6 's attorneys plan to argue three points : that nearly 12,000 absentee ballots rejected on @entity37 should be recounted because at least 4,500 of them were discarded in error			1
if those ballots are allowed , they could flip the race back in @entity6 's favor			1
that the canvassing board did not use a uniform standard when it counted 933 ballots from the discarded pile of absentee ballots			0
those 933 gave @entity18 the edge			2
that some votes were counted twice , which also worked in @entity18 's favor			1
the burden to prove the ballot discrepancies falls on the @entity6 team , @entity29 said			2
" we are , after all , the contestant , " he said			0
" but i have to say that we feel little weight on our shoulders as we go forward			0
" the @entity6 team has said it will also file a class - action lawsuit on behalf of the absentee voters whose ballots were rejected			2
the lawyers dismissed assertions by the @entity65 that @entity1 is in a " constitutional crisis " because it has only one senator in @entity68			0
@entity29 pointed out that @entity69 and @entity70 had one senator attending sessions when then - sens. @entity73 and @entity75 were campaigning during the presidential race			1
@entity29 said " the @entity18 campaign are not nearly so concerned about " those vacancies			2
@entity79 , the lead attorney for the @entity18 recount team , laughed at the comparison and said @entity29 was " thankfully " not serving in the @entity9			1
" the fact is that the @entity83 of the @entity84 provides for two senators from every state , " he said			0
the @entity18 side will ask the @entity88 on february 5 to order gov. @entity89 and secretary of state @entity90 to issue a temporary election certificate so @entity18 can be seated in the @entity9			1
both men have refused , saying they will wait until the matter is resolved			0
it is uncertain how long the case will take to wind its way through the legal channels			0
even if the trial ends quickly , either side could file additional appeals to the state @entity88 or the federal courts			0
the @entity1 seat is the only vacancy in the @entity9 , which @entity105 control by a 58 to 41 margin			0
should @entity18 prevail , @entity105 would be one vote shy of 60 , which would give them the power to muscle through major legislative initiatives over @entity7 objections			2
@entity6 was first elected to the @entity9 in 2002 and has served one term			0
@entity18 is a comedian and liberal talk show host			0
@entity2 's @entity116 contributed to this report .			0
