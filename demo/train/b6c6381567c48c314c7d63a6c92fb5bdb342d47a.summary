-- undisturbed tropical forests are absorbing nearly one - fifth of the co2 released by burning fossil fuels , a new study has found			1
trees in undisturbed tropical forests are soaking up more co2 than people realized			1
the scientific report published in " nature " magazine suggests that the world 's remaining tropical forests remove 4.8 billion tons of @entity3 emissions from the atmosphere each year			1
this includes a previously unknown carbon sink in @entity17 , which annually absorbs 1.2 billion tons of @entity3			1
the study was based on taken data on @entity17 tropical forests from the past 40 years and has shown that for at least the past few decades each hectare of intact @entity17 forest has trapped an extra 0.6 tonnes of carbon per year			1
the scientists then analyzed the new @entity17 data together with @entity27 and @entity28 findings to assess the total sink in tropical forests			1
analysis of these 250,000 tree records reveals that , on average , remaining undisturbed forests are trapping carbon , showing that they are a globally significant carbon sink			2
" we are receiving a free subsidy from nature , " said dr. @entity35 from the @entity36 , and the lead author of the paper , in a press statement			0
" tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18 percent of the @entity3 added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels , substantially buffering the rate of climate change			0
" the study also found that trees of comparable age are gaining girth , though the reasons are unclear			0
for example , a 20 - year - old tree is on average bigger than a 20 - year - old tree measured a decade ago			0
a leading suspect is the extra co2 in the atmosphere , which may act as a fertilizer			0
. however , @entity35 warns , " whatever the cause , we can not rely on this sink forever			0
even if we preserve all remaining tropical forest , these trees will not continue getting bigger indefinitely			0
" the @entity65 reports that each year human activity emits 32 billion tons of @entity3 , but only 15 billion tons actually remain in the atmosphere adding to climate change			1
the new research suggests just where some of the " missing " 17 billion tons per year is going			2
" it 's well known that about half of the ' missing ' carbon is being dissolved in to the oceans , and that the other half is going somewhere on land in vegetation and soils , but we were not sure precisely where			0
according to our study about half the total carbon ' land sink ' is in tropical forest trees , " @entity35 said			2
the protection of tropical forests is likely to become a key theme at the @entity86 in november in @entity87 , @entity88			2
co-author on the study , dr. @entity89 , @entity91 's chief climate change scientist said , " to get an idea of the value of the sink , the removal of nearly 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forests , based on realistic prices for a ton of carbon , should be valued at around Â£ 13 billion ( $ 18.5 billion ) per year			1
this is a compelling argument for conserving tropical forests			2
" dr. @entity35 added , " predominantly rich polluting countries should be transferring substantial resources to countries with tropical forests to reduce deforestation rates and promote alternative development pathways			0

nearly 5 billion tonnes of carbon absorbed by undisturbed tropical forests
study found that trees in forests are getting bigger
new carbon sink discovered in @entity17 that mops up 1.2 billion tons of co2
