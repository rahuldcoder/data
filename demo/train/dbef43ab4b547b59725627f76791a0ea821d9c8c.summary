-- could it really be : might @entity2 end up exactly where it began ? the decision by an @entity2 court to release former president @entity6 from prison and place him under house arrest for now adds to the impression that @entity2 has come full circle , returning precisely to where it stood before the people toppled @entity6 , bringing an end to his 30 - year - long dictatorship			1
it might seem that way , but that is the wrong conclusion			0
@entity2 is a very different place from what it was before @entity6 fell			1
and after 2Â½ years of tumultuous upheaval , so , too , is the rest of the @entity22			1
to say the revolution has not gone as planned is to state the obvious			0
@entity6 's release is an important and rather disheartening symbol of the reverses faced by those who wanted to see dictatorship replaced by democracy			1
since the last day @entity6 was president , @entity2 has experienced the toppling of two regimes , a failed attempt at democracy , and an enormous amount of bloodshed			1
in the process , the country has learned many lessons			0
the innocence of 2011 is gone			0
there is a new maturity , a new realism			0
there 's no sign of jeffersonian democracy anywhere in the @entity47 @entity22 , but there is a new notion that those who govern require the consent of the people before they can enjoy legitimacy in their position			1
a regime may be able to stay in power without that seal of popular acceptability , but it will be tagged as a dictatorship ; it will remain unstable and hated			0
its survival will constitute an affront to the dignity of the nation			0
no government wants to be seen that way			0
no citizen wants to be ruled that way			0
the @entity22 may not look like what most people wanted it to , but it has been transformed			1
that 's why before the @entity2 military moved in to remove @entity74 from the presidency , it made sure it had strong popular support			1
more people signed a petition calling for @entity74 to step down than voted for him in the presidential election			1
@entity2 is now governed by a prime minister handpicked by military chief @entity82 , but @entity82 relies on public approval in a way @entity6 never did			1
the situation , to be sure , lends itself to dangerous populist manipulation and nobody would ever confuse the current structure with a democracy , but it includes important elements that could eventually produce a more democratic future			0
even now , with the military in control , the notion that the people support the army is @entity82 's greatest argument in defense of his position			1
the people have been empowered in a way they never were before			2
the mindset of those who lived under decades of dictatorship has been changed			0
since the intoxicating optimism of @entity108 , people have learned that revolutions are hard to control			2
the disastrous experiment under the @entity112 - dominated government , the economic free fall and the violence @entity2 have endured have offered a stark lesson to @entity2 and its neighbors			1
those who would like to see more inclusive regimes , more democratic elements of government in other @entity22 countries , have watched @entity2			1
they have also watched the catastrophe that is befalling @entity124			0
the revolutionary drive will now be tempered with cooler calculation			0
reform wo n't come after a few weeks on the square chanting slogans for freedom			0
perhaps reformers in @entity2 would become more circumspect			1
true reform will require systematic , gradual plodding			0
democracy requires more than elections			2
@entity136 institutions and a democratic mindset must be developed before it can succeed			0
a foundation of consensus is needed			0
another enormous change since the @entity6 days is the transformation of how people in the @entity22 perceive key players in the region			1
the @entity112 , for example , has not only lost power -- it also has seen its reputation deeply eroded			2
it has shown itself as incompetent and untrustworthy in the eyes of many			0
the @entity112 's @entity74 , elected with only 24 % of eligible voters , behaved as if he had an overwhelming mandate			2
he tried to propel the @entity112 's agenda , pushing a constitution written by his @entity112 allies , appointing @entity112 members to key positions , allowing an atmosphere of intimidation and persecution against non-muslims , and trying to put himself above the law			2
as a result , his initially strong approval ratings fell steadily until millions took to the streets demanding his resignation			0
before he was overthrown , 70 % of @entity2 told pollsters they worried the @entity112 was trying to " islamicize " the country against their will			1
the @entity112 has now been tested			0
that @entity2 experiment will reverberate in a time of turbulence			1
it 's not only the @entity112 whose image has changed			2
@entity124 's @entity176 was once viewed as a moderate , even a reformer			2
with more than 100,000 dead in that country 's civil war , he is now viewed as a ruthless dictator , even if the popular uprising against him now includes many @entity183 fighters , whose ideology is rejected by supporters of democratic change			2
the @entity47 uprisings , even if @entity6 becomes a free man again , have weakened other organizations			1
@entity190 , the @entity192 @entity191 group , has tarnished its name by joining the fight on @entity176 's side			2
@entity196 , the @entity198 version of the @entity112 , still has control of the @entity200 , but it no longer enjoys the support of the bulk of the @entity2 public			1
it may look as if @entity6 is re-entering the same stage he left ; as if nothing had changed			1
but the former @entity2 president is walking onto a changed world			1
the last two years have rerouted the course of history			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			0

a court in @entity2 ordered the release of former president @entity6 from jail
@entity218 : could it really be -- might @entity2 end up exactly where it began ?
she says there 's a realization that legitimate rule requires consent of the people
@entity229 : @entity2 and the @entity22 are not the same as when @entity6 was toppled
