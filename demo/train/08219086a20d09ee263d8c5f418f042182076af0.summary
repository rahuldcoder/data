@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the @entity5 conflict further escalates , refugees continue to cross borders to seek safety in @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity1 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
according to the @entity16 , the number of @entity5 who have registered as refugees -- or are being assisted in these countries -- now exceeds 540,000 , with an increase of over 140,000 during the past six weeks alone			1
i recently traveled to eastern @entity1 to work with @entity19 and assist the refugees who have fled their homes in @entity5			1
it was a cold , foggy day with a constant downpour of icy rain			2
when we crossed the mountains into the @entity0 , the rain turned to a wet snow and a hard wind lashed at us the entire day			2
@entity1 continues to host the largest @entity5 refugee community , with over 170,000 refugees -- and they continue to stream across the border			1
more than 13,000 have arrived in @entity1 over the past several days as the fighting and airstrikes in @entity5 have intensified			1
we met tired and scared families getting off trucks after their 24 - hour escape from @entity5			1
mothers told me accounts of hearing explosions and leaving by foot at dusk , saying they could n't see the scene in the dark to describe it , but they could smell and feel the dust from the explosions			2
the kids were scared and many were holding back a flood of tears			2
the freezing , slushy rain made the situation more desperate and urgent			2
the refugee situation here is different to what we see in most other countries			1
almost all the refugees in @entity1 are in host families or self - made tents constructed from scrap materials such as dismantled billboards			1
the colorful toothpaste and food advertisements that have been turned into shelters make for a strange sight			2
they are scattered across the country in over 540 locations			2
there are no official refugee camps like you find in @entity9 and @entity10 , which makes providing assistance even more challenging			1
the families are arriving in the snow and bitter cold conditions			1
they are carrying plastic bags with the few items they could bring with them as they fled the violence in their country			1
it seems everywhere you look you see refugees standing out in the street , in the mud , with their plastic bags			2
most of them have nowhere to go , so we are providing them with temporary shelter in a training center until they can find another place			2
@entity5 refugees face brutal winter with inadequate shelter and food the majority of the refugees in @entity1 are staying with host families			1
the refugees often pay rent to the families that allow them to stay , or they offer labor in exchange for lodging			1
in some cases there are as many as six refugee families staying with one host family			1
each refugee family , typically eight people , is crowded into one room that serves as their kitchen , living area , bathroom and sleeping quarters			1
in the homes where we are working the electricity is out , the roofs are leaking , the wind whips through the flimsy windows and doors , and it is freezing cold			2
families huddle together around a small stove , struggling to stay warm at night as the temperature plummets to below -10c in this region			1
@entity134 , a 19 - year old refugee who fled her home in @entity5 by foot , now lives with her family in the attic of a host home			1
@entity134 told me : " we are not able to get warm either by day or by night			2
the walls are always damp and it is freezing			0
" in one room i visited , there were two families who had just arrived			1
they were given a storage room to sleep in -- there were no windows , no electricity and just a plastic sheet on the cold , damp cement floor			0
the mothers were unpacking blankets from grain sacks they had used as suitcases when they fled			2
the fathers were assembling an oil stove improvised out of a metal barrel			2
kids were trying to help their parents			0
everyone was silently working in the dark			0
i could see they had just endured a horrible experience and had n't even collected their thoughts			0
they had made it out of @entity5 , through the battle			1
they had found shelter for the night -- and that 's as far as they were in their mind			0
when i asked them what was next , they truly did not know			0
they only hoped they would be provided some humanitarian assistance while they sat out the fighting			0
despite these dire conditions , refugee families offered me tea or to share their dinner			1
out of politeness , they told me it was ok to not remove my shoes as i walked in to their rooms			0
this is almost unheard of in this culture but a politeness offered to the guest foreigner			0
my shoes were muddy and wet from the day and there was no way i could accept their kind offer			0
envoy says 2013 could bring 100,000 deaths in @entity5 as the @entity5 refugee crisis begins its second winter , @entity1 host households are struggling to cope with the burden of increased expenditures , decreased living space , and an ever - increasing need for more food , fuel and basic living necessities			1
most communities hosting @entity5 refugees are the poorest in @entity1 with very weak economies that can not support such a large number of guests for a long period of time			1
the majority of the refugees left their homes initially believing they would soon return			0
however , as the violence continues , their resources are dwindling or already gone			0
refugees who came in the summer months , did not come prepared to endure the harsh winter			0
@entity225 , a 14 - year old refugee who came to @entity1 two months ago told me : " the problem is that i only have my summer clothes here			1
it is so cold now and there is no way to get warm			0
" heaters , blankets , warm clothing and heating fuel are some of the most pressing needs for the winter months , in addition to food , shelter and mattresses			0
in @entity0 , @entity19 has distributed hygiene kits , tablets to purify water , buckets and jerry cans to refugees			0
@entity19 will be distributing over 6,000 winter clothes and over 4,000 vouchers for winter clothes in @entity0 this month			0
@entity19 is also providing psychosocial support services to children and adolescents in the region , and has reached over 2,000 beneficiaries to date			0
the amount of assistance needed here is overwhelming			0
the @entity16 estimates that if fighting in @entity5 continues the refugee figure could reach 1.1 million by june 2013			1
funding is short and is hampering our ability , and our peer humanitarian organizations , to provide the support these refugees so desperately need			0
at the end of the day , i left with a lump in my throat			0
we saw many tears and a vacuum of feeling from fathers who knew they had just walked away from every worldly possession they owned -- knowing it was lost to the war			0
but i ca n't say i felt desperate or hopeless			0
i am an optimist and have to be in order to do this job			0
