i always look forward to a good @entity2 party , especially one with a delicious spread of food			2
but when i decided to go vegan , i worried i would n't be able to enjoy the array of tasty snacks i 'd traditionally binged on while watching the big game			1
luckily , i was wrong			2
in fact , i -- and several of my meat - loving friends -- actually prefer some of these treats to their dairy - and / or meat - infused counterparts			1
so whether you 're vegan , have vegan friends or just want to try something new , check out these ideas for tasty vegan snacks guaranteed to satisfy any football fan			1
upwave : a carnivore 's guide to becoming vegan @entity22 by @entity23 ' it kind this dish combines two great party foods ( both personal favorites ) : pizza and buffalo wings			1
a cauliflower buffalo wing may sound odd , but if you give it a chance , you 'll likely enjoy it			1
roasting the cauliflower gives it a crunchy yet chewy -- but not rubbery -- texture , so you avoid the sogginess associated with most boiled / steamed cauliflower			0
combine that with the crispy cornmeal crust and faux ( but still tasty ) blue - cheese spread , and partygoers will be dancing in the endzone with every bite			1
@entity45 by @entity46 sure , sliders may seem like a snack more apt for the @entity49 than the @entity2 , but these delicious little " burgers " are going to be the talk of your football party			0
the caramelized onions folded into the savory black bean patties infuse a flavor not achievable by just piling them on top , and the carrots , onion , chili powder and cilantro add a unique , zesty kick not found in other burgers , regardless what they 're made of			0
add to this the fresh , homemade guacamole and you have a truly southwestern sensation guaranteed to warm you up , no matter how your team is doing			0
and do n't forget the mango sauce ! its sweet flavor complements the taste of the rest of the burger quite well			0
upwave : why avocados are good for you baked sriracha potato chips by @entity80 no @entity2 sunday couch is complete without a big bowl of chips			0
while there are plenty of vegan options available , there 's nothing like the satisfaction that comes from knowing you made these from scratch and did n't just dump them out of a greasy bag			2
plus , you have complete control of their flavor level and crunchiness			0
i love the kick sriracha gives this recipe , so i add a little more than others with tamer taste buds might like , giving me an excuse to make two batches : really spicy for me and not - too - spicy for my wife and our guests			2
this recipe is ultra simple : you just need a @entity112 potato , sriracha , peanut oil and salt			0
@entity117 nachos by @entity118 if there 's one item i expect to see at any @entity2 party , it 's a plate of nachos			0
but apple nachos instead of traditional corn chips ? ! sure ! you 'll appreciate the crisp crunch of the apples in this dessert - like dish , and the always - winning combo of peanut butter and chocolate mixes well with the flavor of the apples , nuts and coconut			1
plus , this recipe will give your @entity2 spread the sweet - tooth fix guests will likely be craving after those savory snacks			2
and do n't forget : this recipe is better for you than a plate of traditional nachos , and it ( arguably ) tastes better , too ! upwave : does an apple a day really keep the doctor away ? a football may be nostalgically referred to as the ol ' pigskin , but that does n't mean all of the food needs to be wrapped in bacon at this year 's @entity2 shindig			0
when the big game rolls around and people start huddling around the snack table , they 'll be blown away by these vegan goodies , regardless of what they regularly eat			1
