-- as a rehabilitation physician , i 've supported many of the ideas behind the @entity5 since before @entity7 's presidency began			1
during the hot summer of town hall debates surrounding the legislation in 2009 , i wrote an essay called " standing up for @entity7 's health plan , " and i have continued highlighting the fundamental advances that all of us , most especially disabled @entity15 , stand to share under the @entity5			1
but when the @entity7 administration decided last week to pull out a major pillar of the @entity5 , they lost my faith in their political wisdom			1
there was a practical necessity to many of the president 's other compromises in order to get the @entity5 passed			1
regrettably , it gives states just enough power over insurance marketplaces and the @entity32 expansion to continue the unequal and unfair distribution of state - based social services			0
it allows states to eviscerate @entity32 in ways that do n't make sense			2
in some states , @entity32 pays to save the life of a stroke victim in the hospital , but then denies adequate rehabilitation services and devices to prevent that person 's ongoing health problems from rapidly placing further strain on the thin social - service safety net			2
the vast majority of @entity15 get medical insurance through their employers , although the number of employers that offer insurance has fallen 10 % since 2000 , and the insurance they do offer is increasingly lousy			0
low - quality insurance , like so - called " mini medical " plans , is common			0
employees wo n't know their coverage is insufficient until it 's too late			1
if you work for one of these companies and your child suffers a serious trauma , the 30 visits or fewer these plans offer for outpatient therapy simply wo n't be enough			2
i 've seen this gut - wrenching situation time and again			0
true health care reform must end this sorry state of affairs in the workplace , where health care is centered			0
but by postponing for a year the implementation of the @entity5 's requirement that employers with more than 50 full - time workers offer insurance of minimally acceptable quality or face fines of $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 , the administration has weakened the core of health care reform			1
it is delaying a critical national debate on what the @entity5 minimums should be			1
how did this happen ? the administration caved to pressure from business lobbyists , who , according to @entity99 , " mounted a coordinated campaign to convince senior @entity96 officials that their date for requiring coverage was simply impractical			0
" it 's too bad patients and health care providers did n't get their counterbalancing message out			1
without it , the business lobby was able to create an atmosphere of false urgency by claiming businesses were n't ready to start filing the information about the insurance plans they offer ( or do n't )			2
without that critical information , the rest of the already heavily compromised @entity5 apparatus starts to tilt precariously			2
how can the government enforce the individual mandate , which requires people to buy insurance if their employers do n't offer it or if they offer insurance that is substandard or overpriced ? without information from businesses , the government wo n't know whether individuals are claiming legitimate exemptions or not			1
the federal government has long excelled at helping private businesses attract and retain workers with affordable benefits			0
@entity15 business lobbyists do n't gripe so much about the nearly $ 200 billion in tax credits the nation grants their clients by designating employer - offered health benefits nontaxable			2
you 'd think businesses would be pleased that the @entity135 projects that businesses that do n't offer qualifying insurance plans will be paying only $ 10 billion in penalties in 2014			1
now they 'll be paying zilch			0
in its notice announcing the @entity5 delay , the administration correctly states that the vast majority of employers already provide insurance			1
but so what ? the @entity5 is as much about regulating insurance as encouraging businesses to provide it			1
@entity15 's employers , left to their own devices , have been exchanging dinky medical insurance for cheaper products and services for too long			0
@entity154 , which owns a variety of chain hotels , mostly in the @entity157 , recently disclosed to @entity158 how much it nickle - and - dimes the health of its 550 employees			0
the company 's chief financial officer says it offers a limited benefit plan , and now that the @entity5 is delayed for a year , it may increase the employee contribution on the full - benefit plan it was planning to offer next year under the law			1
the next time you stay at @entity171 's @entity172 in @entity173 , @entity174 , know that you could be paying a few cents less for your room so that @entity171 can provide capped health coverage to its valued employees			0
but if a @entity171 employee were to suffer a catastrophic injury , every taxpaying citizen of @entity174 would be paying a few cents more to provide the @entity32 coverage and social services the patient needs			0
why does it make sense to let companies make irresponsible choices in exchange for a little more profit ? these are the kinds of cutthroat business decisions a massive piece of legislation like the @entity5 should combat			2
the retail and restaurant lobbyists who stealthily hunted bigger profit margins these past few months will now seize on the act 's wounded carcass			0
@entity200 are already charging that this delay proves the administration knows the @entity5 is unworkable			1
they 're using this decision as another opportunity to stop or delay the law			0
they 're right to do so			0
the @entity5 represents a large , painful change for a number of @entity15 institutions			2
hospitals , doctors , patients , insurers and our government are in for a period of turmoil as these changes pulse through society 's many layers			0
handing a reprieve to one of those groups is unfair to the rest of us , and will distort the necessary debates as specific problems come to light just in time for the 2014 midterm elections			1
the administration should either delay the whole law until 2015 or go forward in 2014 as planned			0
mortally wounding the @entity5 before the coming battle is n't compromise -- it 's foreshadowing			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			2

@entity234 says the new delay in employer mandate has made him lose faith in @entity7 's wisdom
he says businesses lobbied for delay , but the poorly insured and taxpayers pay the price
he says move delays penalties , *protects* profits , for businesses that do n't meet @entity5 regulations
@entity234 : mortally wounding @entity5 before midterm elections helps its *opponents*
