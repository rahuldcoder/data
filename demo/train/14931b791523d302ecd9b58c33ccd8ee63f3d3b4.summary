the three presidents of the @entity1 's main bodies will take the podium together to accept it			1
the @entity10 announced the choice on october 12 , praising the partnership of 27 nations for promoting democracy and reconciliation since @entity16 but the choice has not been without controversy			1
within the @entity1 , disparities have persisted between economically strong members -- such as @entity21 , which has fronted @entity23 bailout money -- and economically weaker countries like @entity25 , suffering from strict austerity measures and crushing unemployment			1
three @entity29 laureates called the award to the @entity1 " unlawful " in a letter of protest in late november			1
@entity33 does not qualify as a peacemaker as defined by the prize 's founder , @entity35 , said archbishop @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			2
" the @entity1 is not seeking to realize @entity29 s demilitarized global peace order , " they wrote			2
they asked the @entity29 board " to clarify that it can not and will not pay the prize from its funds			0
" @entity51 president @entity50 , @entity47 president @entity46 and @entity23 @entity49 president @entity48 will represent the 500 million citizens of the union at the ceremony at @entity55			0
the @entity1 will allocate the 8 million kronor ( $ 1.2 million ) prize money to support educational projects for children in conflict regions and will add to the sum to more than double it , according to a statement on the @entity1 website			2
the projects are to include providing for protective spaces for children , raising awareness about land mines , and the re-establishment of school systems when conflicts end			0
in its announcement in october , the @entity10 said that the @entity1 " for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation , democracy and human rights in @entity23			1
" it singled out the peaceful reconciliation between @entity21 and @entity77 -- an amity forged between neighbors who fought each other last century			1
" since 1945 , that reconciliation has become a reality , " the committee said in a statement			0
" today , war between @entity21 and @entity77 is unthinkable			1
" the committee also focused on the spread of democracy to newer member nations			0
" in the 1980s , @entity25 , @entity88 and @entity89 joined the @entity1			2
the introduction of democracy was a condition for their membership , " the committee said			0
all three countries saw dictatorships in the 20th century , even after @entity16 it cited progress in peace made by @entity1 candidate nations , such as the former @entity102 republics			1
" we have to keep in mind that there are not so many years ago since people on this part of @entity23 killed each other -- awful wars , " said committee chairman @entity103 , referring to the warfare in @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
but in the @entity117 , the award has been greeted with a great degree of skepticism			0
by failing to take a united position at the very earliest stages of the crisis , the @entity1 is widely considered to have contributed to the bloody events that followed			0
at the same time , its failure to respond more decisively to the conflict once it had broken out is seen by many to have cost tens of thousands of lives , wrote political researcher @entity128 of @entity129 in a commentary for @entity131			0
in the face of widespread fear of growing instability , the prize has been seen by many as a pat on the back for the struggling @entity1			2
" the award by the @entity10 shows that in these difficult times the @entity1 remains a force of inspiration for countries and people all over the world and that our global community needs a strong @entity1 , " said @entity50			1
this year 's winner was picked from 231 different nominations -- 43 for organizations and the rest for individuals , the @entity10 said			2
other large organizations have won the @entity3 , including the @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity154 peacekeeping forces , the @entity154 atomic energy agency and the @entity158 .			0
