-- former presidential candidate @entity1 had some biting words about @entity3 , saying the self - described " libertarian - ish " lawmaker is retreating from his roots as he broadens his appeal for a potential presidential bid			1
" what he ought to do is go back to his father , sit on his knee and become more like @entity13 , " @entity1 said in a new video published monday			1
@entity1 , a liberal consumer advocate who espouses left - libertarian views , ran for president as the @entity19 nominee in 2000 and as an independent candidate in 2004 and 2008 and as a write - in candidate in 1992 and 1996			1
@entity1 's comments came in an interview saturday in @entity24 with @entity25 , an activist who 's known for confronting high - profile political figures and whose goal is to " expose corruption worldwide , " according to his website			2
the senator 's office had no comment on @entity1 's remarks			0
@entity1 told @entity25 he shares @entity13 's views " against militarism " and " against a bloated military budget " but argued the @entity38 @entity37 is " changing by the month			1
" " he 's beginning to change , " he continued			0
" you can see him in just one year			0
he 's not going to go on the floor and filibustering again , the way he did courageously			0
that 's what blind ambition does			0
" @entity1 argued that @entity13 wants to give more aid to @entity46 , a reference to the first - term senator 's policy on foreign aid that came under question this year			2
@entity13 , however , maintains that he has n't changed his position on aid to @entity46 and would still like to see an eventual end of @entity56 assistance to the country			0
@entity3 : @entity56 aid to @entity46 ok -- for now @entity1 has been pushing the idea of a left - right alliance and earlier this year said he could envision @entity13 as a possible leader of the movement , but still expressed skepticism of what he called his " evolving " views			1
as @entity13 broadens his appeal among @entity37 and even @entity67 , he has attracted closer scrutiny of his views and issues on which he agrees or disagrees with his father , a former congressman and presidential candidate who ran as a @entity74 in 1988 and as a @entity37 in 2008 and 2012			1
while @entity3 has long sought to distinguish himself from his father 's political brand , his own star has in part benefited from his father 's fame as well as the grassroots support he generated in key early presidential primary states			2
if @entity13 wins the @entity37 presidential nomination in 2016 , the @entity74 could also nominate him in an effort to avoid a spoiler situation in a close general election race			2
a new report tuesday by @entity88 shows that leaders and constituencies in the @entity74 are already gearing up for an internal debate over the scenario .			0
