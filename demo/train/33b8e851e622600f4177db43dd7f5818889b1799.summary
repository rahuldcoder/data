-- the @entity1 is failing to adequately keep track of its firearms , creating an environment in which weapons are vulnerable to theft or misuse , according to a government report released friday			1
due to " a lackadaisical attitude toward firearms management " by commanders , investigators said they found " credible evidence of conditions that would allow for theft and misuse of firearms , and the ability to conceal the fact if weapons were missing			1
" in a force of approximately 640 officers , the report says , hundreds of weapons were not properly accounted for			1
the auditors also allege that the agency has more than 1,400 extra weapons , including 477 military - style automatic and semiautomatic rifles			2
the head of the @entity1 officers ' union , @entity29 , said there are shortcomings in the " antiquated system of weapon tracking , " but public safety was never put in jeopardy			1
" none of these weapons were ever seized in a crime , or found on someone who should n't have one , " he said			2
while the tracking system has its failings , he said , " all the weapons are accounted for			1
every weapon , every stick of ammo , everything is accounted for			2
but it 's not accounted for in the @entity50 weapons inventory computer system			1
" the @entity50 declined to respond to @entity52 's specific assertion			1
but it said it has immediately ordered a complete weapons inventory , to address the " significant , systemic firearms management problems " identified in the report			1
" i have no tolerance for this management failure , " said @entity56 , director of the @entity50			1
he pledged to implement the report 's recommendations on record - keeping , and went on to praise the police officers			2
" the brave men and women of the @entity1 are professionals who put their life on the line every day , " he said , " protecting our parks for millions to enjoy			0
" the report cited several examples of mishandling of weapons , including two officers it says brought their rifles home with them			2
but at least one example has come into dispute			0
the audit asserts that a former chief of the @entity1 never turned in his handgun , and 10 years after his retirement it was taken from him by an instructor at a qualification course for retired law enforcement officers , who happened to notice the former chief still had government property			0
but the former chief , @entity86 , rejects the claim , saying he never kept a handgun , he never had one taken away , and he was never asked by auditors about the allegation			0
the first he heard of it was when he got a call from @entity0 on friday morning			0
" nobody ever confiscated a gun of mine			0
i would recall that , " he said			0
" where did they get that ? " he said he turned in his weapon when he left government service , and showed @entity0 his paperwork			0
when asked about the contradiction , the inspector general 's office said its report was based on @entity1 records , and the discrepancy just shows the extent of the agency 's record - keeping problems			0
the @entity50 did not respond to an inquiry about the former chief 's paperwork			1
