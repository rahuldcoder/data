@entity1 's @entity0 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday on ' @entity4 ' to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			2
@entity9 's personal @entity8 rebranding effort , a couple of feuds in the @entity8 family , @entity14 worries about voting restrictions and @entity17 anger at a former obama cabinet member made for an action - packed trip around the " @entity4 " table			1
@entity22 to @entity23 : you are n't ready			1
and then , take two sen. @entity22 of @entity25 tells the @entity26 he might run for president in 2016			1
ok , that hardly makes him unique			2
but he says one reason is because the @entity8 needs a hawkish voice in the mix , and he does n't see @entity32 sen. @entity23 as up to the challenge			1
read the interview , and it 's clear @entity22 thinks his colleague from @entity32 is too young and too worried , @entity22 says , about offending the party 's conservative base			1
it 's all there in writing			2
but @entity42 of the @entity43 tells us the story does n't end there			2
@entity22 , a @entity47 gentleman after all , apparently felt compelled to call and explain			1
" sen. @entity22 actually called @entity49 and suggested that he got a little bit over his skis and was n't trying to diss sen. @entity23 and that he was taken out of context there , " @entity42 said			1
" so i think this is one of those examples , @entity57 , when you say something to a reporter and you see it in print and then you want that one back			1
@entity9 and the @entity8 brand sen. @entity9 makes no secret of the fact he thinks the @entity8 needs an image makeover if it wants to be competitive in presidential politics			1
he is trying to build bridges to the @entity72 - @entity71 community and spends a lot of time on college campuses			1
the question is , will his views hurt him among social conservatives who have outsized influence in some early presidential battlegrounds ? this past week , @entity9 said he did not oppose birth control , including the so - called @entity82 morning after pill many @entity84 conservatives consider tantamount to abortion			1
and in an interview with @entity1 's @entity88 , @entity9 also opened the door to , like president @entity90 , evolving away from his opposition to same - sex marriage			1
" i mean , people change their minds all the time on this issue , and even within the @entity8 , there are people whose child turns out to be gay , and they 're like , ' oh , well , maybe i want to rethink this issue , ' " @entity9 said			1
" so it 's been rethought			2
the president 's rethought the issue			2
so i mean , a lot of people have rethought the issue			0
" " you could rethink it at some point , too ? " @entity88 asked him			0
he shrugged and gave a half - grimace			1
so stay tuned on this potential " evolution			1
good for book sales but not so good for @entity90 @entity113 of @entity114 shared reporting on @entity17 concerns about the latest insider account from a former @entity90 loyalist			1
@entity119 , the former defense secretary and @entity121 chief , writes in a new book that @entity90 did n't make much of an effort to overcome @entity125 resistance to leaving a residual @entity71 military force in the country			0
" those on our side viewed the @entity17 as so eager to rid itself of @entity125 that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests , " @entity119 said in an excerpt from his new book , " @entity130			1
" and there is more			0
veteran diplomat @entity143 also has a new book that levels criticism at both @entity90 and former secretary of state @entity146			0
we know vice president @entity148 does n't like this trend			0
" i 'm finding that former administration officials , as soon as they leave , write books , which i think is inappropriate , " @entity148 said thursday			2
" at least give the guy a chance to get out of office			0
" so after a couple of days touting good economic news , @entity113 notes , the @entity17 will be forced to pivot back to a more controversial topic			1
" we 'll see president @entity90 in the coming week really back on the defensive about his foreign policy , " @entity113 said			2
" this is all happening at a time when president @entity90 is dealing with this nightmare on the @entity165 crisis and does not want his ( @entity167 ) staff pulled off to the side to deal with this , but it really could be a problem for @entity90 's legacy , has the potential to hurt midterms and very interesting to see how @entity146 handles it so that is not something that dogs her before 2016			1
turnout matters , and democrats see obstacles in new restrictions @entity14 know their best odds in this difficult midterm election year depend on getting their base voters -- including african - americans and @entity184 -- to turn out in percentages higher than the historical averages			2
but the @entity188 's @entity187 says some @entity14 are nervous because of voting restrictions that just happen to be in some of the key 2014 battlegrounds			0
" they 've put so much emphasis on the ground game , they 've put so much emphasis on trying to bring in new voters in a midterm year , but in a lot of states , there are new voting restrictions going into effect -- in states like @entity204 , which is suddenly in play , and @entity206 , the voter @entity207 got thrown out of court , but they still restricted the voting hours , " @entity187 said			0
" and so @entity14 are starting to worry that in these elections that are going to be so close , it 's going to be a real problem for them			0
in @entity215 , some @entity8 see hardball unfolding after @entity217 snub just 10 days ago , house speaker @entity217 went to @entity215 and raised some money for @entity8 congressional candidate @entity219 , a state senator who is trailing but in a close race against a @entity14 incumbent			0
in a radio interview a few days after the @entity217 visit , @entity219 refused to commit to voting for the speaker if , as promised , he seeks another term in january			0
now , several @entity215 @entity8 say they are hearing the @entity226 , the @entity8 campaign arm run by @entity217 deputies , is letting it be known it wo n't spend in the 2nd @entity229 in the final month of the campaign			0
can we connect those dots ? is it just a tough resource decision ? or a misunderstanding ? we 'll keep an eye on it			0
interesting , because the @entity8 does have a chance at a few race pickups in @entity240			0
@entity241 : @entity242 reached out after the show sunday to clear things up -- and to give an unequivocal response to the question the candidate did not directly answer on the radio show			0
" @entity250 is focused on running her race and talking about the issues relevant to @entity215 voters , not @entity256 politics , " @entity219 campaign manager @entity249 told @entity1			0
" but she fully intends to support @entity217 for speaker if she is elected to @entity259 in november			0
" that should put to rest any understanding			0
now we 'll see if the @entity226 helps out in the final month .			0
