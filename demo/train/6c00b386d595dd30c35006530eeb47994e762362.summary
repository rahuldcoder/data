@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 - led war in @entity1 marked its 10th year friday having passed two major milestones : the @entity6 has been forced out of power and @entity8 is dead			1
but there was little observance by @entity4 troops in @entity1 , where a month earlier many participated in commemorations to mark the 10th anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
" we really celebrated the 10th anniversary of 9/11 , and we were out here in @entity1 , " marine corps maj. gen. @entity16 , commanding general of @entity18 troops in southern @entity1 , told reporters during a briefing on thursday			1
" i think that to us it was a far more significant date than 10 years of fighting in @entity1 because , really , when you look at the 10 years , you 're looking at different levels of forces , different levels of attention given to @entity1			2
" the @entity4 - led war in @entity1 began october 7 , 2011 , with an air campaign that was followed within weeks by a ground invasion			1
president @entity31 has called it " the longest - running war in the nation 's history "			2
the aim was to oust the @entity6 and dismantle @entity38 's leadership , though the leaders of both groups -- @entity41 and @entity8 -- managed to escape capture			0
@entity8 was killed in may during a raid by @entity4 commandos on his hideout in @entity46 , @entity47			2
the whereabouts of @entity41 is unknown , and he has not been seen in public in years			0
as the @entity4 turned its attention toward @entity52 , insurgent violence in @entity1 flared against @entity1 civilians and security forces as well as the @entity4 and its coalition partners			1
more than 2,700 troops from the @entity4 and its partners have died during the 10 years of war , according to a @entity2 count			1
of those , 1,780 were @entity4 , 382 were @entity61 and 157 were @entity62			1
since the conflict began , the number of casualties has risen by the year , with a significant jump from 2008 to 2009			0
at least 296 coalition troops died in 2008			1
it nearly doubled in 2009 when 517 coalition troops were killed			2
that year , president @entity31 authorized a surge of 33,000 @entity4 forces to @entity1 to combat the violence			1
two years later , the @entity4 outlined its plan to withdraw its troops from @entity1 , beginning with pulling the 33,000 surge troops by the end of 2012 and the remaining 68,000 by the end of 2014			1
the move was followed by withdrawal announcements by most of the @entity81 nations			1
on thursday , defense ministers from the 49 nations that make up the @entity18 pledged their support to @entity1 even as they make plans to withdraw troops by 2014			1
" let there be no mistake : transition is not departure			0
we will not take our leave when the @entity1 take the lead , " @entity81 secretary general @entity91 told reporters thursday in @entity93 , @entity94			1
the ministers are scheduled to meet again in may in @entity99 where @entity91 said they will " need to decide what more we will do			0
" while @entity81 has insisted that the transition of security for the country to @entity1 forces is conditions - based rather than calendar - driven , the clock is ticking on the withdrawal deadline			1
the planned withdrawal has raised a number of questions about the stability of @entity1 , which has been hit by a wave of high - profile attacks in recent months that have jeopardized the peace negotiations			2
last month 's turban bomb assassination of former @entity1 president @entity118 , revered by many as a father of the @entity122 movement that ousted the @entity123 in the 1980s , appears to have dealt the biggest blow to the peace process			2
@entity118 was the chairman of president @entity127 's @entity126 , which has been trying for a year to foster dialogue with the @entity6 -- a strategy that @entity127 publicly abandoned following @entity118 's killing			0
the war in @entity1 , once viewed by a majority of @entity4 as a must , has become widely unpopular as concerns have shifted to the economy and job losses			1
in a new @entity140 report on war and sacrifice released this week , half of post- 9/11 veterans said the @entity1 war has been worth fighting			2
only 44 % felt that way about @entity52 , and one - third said both wars were worth the costs			0
@entity149 is among those veterans who question the war			0
@entity149 , who was a freshman in college and a @entity154 student on september 11 , 2001 , said he remembers thinking that the war in @entity1 would be over before he joined the @entity155			1
but as the war continued , @entity149 said he began to have mixed feelings			0
" i joined to defend the country , and i feel that a lot of the things we were doing were not exactly that , " he said in a @entity163			0
" in my opinion , it basically should have been limited to what we initially were going in to do : @entity168 and the architects of the attacks			0
" @entity149 said it is very difficult to look back objectively on the experience			0
" you lost friends and made sacrifices			0
you do n't want to ever think that everything that happened was in vain , " he said			0
but @entity179 has a different perspective on the war , which he says gave his family back their home and their livelihoods			0
he was 13 when he and his family fled their home in @entity1 's @entity188 amid a civil war that would see the @entity6 take control of the country			2
driven out by bombardments and fighting , his family crossed into @entity47 , making their home in @entity195			0
@entity179 , 28 , said " everything changed " after the @entity6 were forced from power			0
@entity179 , who worked for a @entity4 business for two years upon his return to @entity1 , founded media startup @entity201 last year			1
" ( @entity203 ) veryone can have a job and go to school ( now ) , and i can have my business , " he said in a @entity163 .			0
