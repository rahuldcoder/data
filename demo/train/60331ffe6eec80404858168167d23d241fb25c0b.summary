an e. you can write it with one fluid swoop of a pen or one tap of the keyboard			0
the most commonly used letter in the @entity9 dictionary			0
simple , right ? now imagine it printed out millions of times on thousands of forms and documents			0
then think of how much ink would be needed			2
ok , so that may have been a first for you , but it came naturally to 14 - year - old @entity19 when he was trying to think of ways to cut waste and save money at his @entity24 - area middle school			1
it all started as a science fair project			0
as a neophyte sixth - grader at @entity30 , @entity28 noticed he was getting a lot more handouts than he did in elementary school			1
interested in applying computer science to promote environmental sustainability , @entity28 decided he was going to figure out if there was a better way to minimize the constant flurry of paper and ink			2
reducing paper use through recycling and dual - sided printing had been talked about before as a way to save money and conserve resources , but there was less attention paid to the ink for which the paper served as a canvas for history and algebra handouts			2
" ink is two times more expensive than @entity59 perfume by volume , " @entity54 says with a chuckle			0
he 's right : @entity62 perfume costs $ 38 per ounce , while the equivalent amount of @entity66 printer ink can cost up to $ 75			2
so @entity28 decided to focus his project on finding ways to cut down on the costly liquid			1
collecting random samples of teachers ' handouts , @entity28 concentrated on the most commonly used characters ( e , t , a , o and r )			2
first , he charted how often each character was used in four different typefaces : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
then he measured how much ink was used for each letter , using a commercial tool called @entity88			0
next he enlarged the letters , printed them and cut them out on cardstock paper to weigh them to verify his findings			0
he did three trials for each letter , graphing the ink usage for each font			0
from this analysis , @entity28 figured out that by using @entity81 with its thinner strokes , his school district could reduce its ink consumption by 24 % , and in turn save as much as $ 21,000 annually			1
encouraged by his teacher , @entity28 looked to publish his findings and stumbled on the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) , a publication founded by a group of @entity105 grad students in 2011 that provides a forum for the work of middle school and high school students			1
it has the same standards as academic journals , and each submission is reviewed by grad students and academics			0
@entity115 , one of @entity101 's founders , says that of the nearly 200 submissions they have received since 2011 , @entity28 's project was a real standout : " we were so impressed			1
we really could really see the real - world application in @entity28 's paper			1
" @entity115 said @entity28 's findings were so clear , simple and well thought - out , it had the peer reviewers at @entity126 , " how much potential savings is really out there ? " for the answer , @entity101 challenged @entity28 to apply his project to a larger scale : the federal government			1
with an annual printing expenditure of $ 1.8 billion , the government was a much more challenging task than his school science project			1
@entity28 repeated his tests on five sample pages from documents on the @entity143 website and got similar results -- change the font , save money			1
will government printers embrace a change ? using the @entity150 's estimated annual cost of ink -- $ 467 million -- @entity28 concluded that if the federal government used @entity81 exclusively it could save nearly 30 % -- or $ 136 million per year			1
an additional $ 234 million could be saved annually if state governments also jumped on board , he reported			0
@entity155 , media and public relations manager at the @entity143 , describes @entity28 's work as " remarkable			1
" but he was noncommittal on whether the @entity143 would introduce changes to typeface , saying the @entity143 's efforts to become more environmentally sustainable were focused on shifting content to the @entity163			1
" in 1994 , we were producing 20,000 copies a day of both the @entity166 and @entity167			0
twenty years later , we produce roughly 2,500 print copies a day , " he said			0
on top of this , the @entity170 is printed on recycled paper , which @entity143 has been doing for five or six years , @entity169 says			2
one federal initiative that focuses on minimizing ink - usage is called " @entity176			2
" implemented 18 months ago by the @entity150 , it teaches government offices how to default their computer settings to @entity82 , @entity81 and @entity83 to minimize printing waste			2
according to @entity150 's press secretary @entity182 , they hope this type of initiative could ultimately save the federal government up to $ 30 million annually			1
@entity28 appreciates the government 's efforts , but he sees his project as a means of making an even bigger impact nationwide			1
" consumers are still printing at home , they can make this change too , " he says			0
holding out hope at 14 , @entity28 understands how difficult such a project might be to implement -- " i recognize it 's difficult to change someone 's behavior			1
that 's the most difficult part			0
" but he holds out hope : " i definitely would love to see some actual changes and i 'd be happy to go as far as possible to make that change possible			0
" with decades ahead to lend a hand , @entity28 and other young men and women like him may even be able to untangle some of the knotty political and technical issues that beset @entity212 , corporate suites and the world at large			2
know a young entrepreneur ? ' @entity216 ' of @entity218 font dies at 84			0

middle - school student says the federal government could cut printing costs with one decision
@entity19 analyzed ink use for school project , then expanded his *research*
so far , the @entity143 is noncommittal on @entity28 's *suggestion*
