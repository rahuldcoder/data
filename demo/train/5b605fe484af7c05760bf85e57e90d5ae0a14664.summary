-- the captain and chief officer of a @entity4 - registered ship that ran aground on the @entity5 will appear in an @entity7 court thursday , charged with damaging the reef			1
the @entity9 1 veered more than 27 kilometers ( 17 miles ) off course and ended up on a shoal in the @entity5 on april 3 , prompting concerns of an oil spill near the world 's largest coral reef system			1
on wednesday , the @entity16 announced that they have arrested the 47 - year - old @entity4 master of the vessel and the 44 - year - old chief officer			1

the ship was carrying about 65,000 tons of coal to @entity4 from the @entity7 port of @entity36 when it ran aground on the shoal -- a combination of shell and sand -- near the southernmost point of the @entity5 , just north of @entity43			2

the @entity5 is made up of roughly 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands spanning over 2,600 km ( 1,600 miles ) off the coast of @entity80 in the @entity81 .			2
