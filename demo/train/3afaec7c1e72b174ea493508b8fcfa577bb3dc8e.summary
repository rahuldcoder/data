-- @entity1 was once known as the automobile capital of the world -- a global symbol of modernity and a testament to the power of @entity9 capitalism			1
after decades of industrial decay , however , the " @entity1 " finally crashed when it filed for municipal bankruptcy in july 2013			1
many long - time investors fled for safer havens beyond the city limits as property prices plummeted and businesses suffered			1
but not everyone took flight			0
others settled in for the long haul , sure that the city that brought us the sounds of @entity25 and some of the most iconic cars ever built would bounce back			2
one such man was @entity28			0
the @entity30 - based developer stunned @entity1 by purchasing the abandoned packard automotive plant earlier this year -- one of the most famous buildings to be sold after the city filed for bankruptcy and the most emblematic eyesore of @entity1 's fall			1
but @entity38 sees beauty and possibility amid the ruin of the @entity43 site			0
" i think that the @entity44 is in the best location ... surrounded by extraordinary highways , railways , airports , very close to @entity49 , " @entity28 said			0
a look at the numbers illustrates why international investors like @entity28 are entranced by @entity1 's under - appreciated assets			1
@entity28 bought the 325,000 square meter ( 3.5 million square feet ) packard space for just $ 405,000			0
to put these figures into context , @entity57 's average price per square meter of office space is about $ 6,000			0
with @entity1 home to an estimated 78,000 abandoned buildings , it is little wonder then that international buyers spy an opportunity with big potential returns			1
a @entity70 firm bought three properties downtown last year			0
in around 15 years , at a cost of approximately $ 350 million , @entity28 envisions transforming the @entity43 site into a residential , commercial and industrial hub			2
" ten years ( and ) you will not recognize it , " he said excitedly			2
" you will think it was always in perfect shape			0
so we will do it			0
" six years ago @entity28 invested heavily in @entity83 's historical center , an area also blighted by vandalism and decades of deterioration			2
he bought property at rock - bottom prices then sat back and watched the value quickly rise			2
@entity1 , and the world , will be watching closely watch to see if history repeats itself and if @entity28 's financial prediction bears fruit			1

@entity1 was once a *powerhouse* of automotive *manufacturing* but has suffered in recent years
international investors are *snapping* up sites for a *fraction* of their previous value in the city
some are looking to build big property development projects on the land they buy
