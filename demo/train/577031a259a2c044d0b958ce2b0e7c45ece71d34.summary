-- @entity4 's electronic intelligence agency monitored delegates ' phones and tried to capture their passwords during an economic summit held there in 2009 , the @entity2 newspaper reported sunday			1
the targets included @entity4 allies such as @entity12 and @entity13 , the newspaper reported			0
the @entity2 cited documents provided by @entity15 , the @entity16 computer analyst now spilling secrets of the @entity16 intelligence community			1
the latest report was published on the eve of another economic summit hosted by the @entity4 government -- the @entity24 economic summit in @entity25			1
according to the newspaper , the documents show that the @entity4 signals intelligence agency @entity27 used " ground - breaking intelligence capabilities " to intercept calls made by members of the larger @entity31 conference delegations at meetings in @entity33			1
analysts received round - the - clock summaries of calls that were being made , and @entity27 set up internet cafes for delegates in hopes of intercepting e-mails and capturing keystrokes , the @entity2 reported			2
one briefing slide explained that would give intelligence agencies the ability to read delegates ' e-mails " before / as they do , " providing " sustained intelligence options against them even after conference has finished			0
" bigger threat : @entity15 or @entity54 ? @entity27 is @entity4 's equivalent of the @entity54 , the highly secretive @entity16 communications intelligence service			1
the @entity2 reported that the @entity54 had attempted to eavesdrop on then - @entity58 president @entity57 during the conference as his phone calls passed through satellite links to @entity62 and briefed its @entity4 counterparts on the effects			1
@entity15 , 29 , worked for the @entity54 through a private contractor firm until may , when he decamped to @entity66			1
he went public a week ago as the source of articles by the @entity2 and the @entity69 , saying the @entity54 's efforts posed " an existential threat to democracy			1
" @entity73 , a spokesman for the @entity74 , said sunday he was aware of the @entity2 's latest report but declined to comment on it			1
" what we should be focused on is how irresponsible and egregious these recent leaks are , " he told @entity0			0
" it 's impossible to know exactly how much damage is being done by these disclosures , but they will have an effect on our counterterrorism efforts			0
" @entity15 's revelations about the @entity54 's collection of millions of records from @entity16 telecommunications and technology firms have led to a furious debate within the @entity16 about the scale and scope of surveillance programs that date to the days after the 2001 @entity96 attacks on @entity97 and @entity98			1
defenders say the programs -- approved by @entity101 after a warrantless surveillance effort under the @entity104 administration was revealed in 2005 -- have protected @entity16 lives by helping agents break up terrorism plots			2
@entity108 defends @entity54 , calls @entity110 's credibility ' nonexistent ' retired gen. @entity111 , a former @entity54 director , told @entity0 's @entity112 that what the agency collects are " essentially billing records " that detail the time , duration and number of a phone call			2
the records are added to a database that agents can query in cases involving a terror investigation overseas , and agents ca n't eavesdrop on @entity16 ' calls without an order from a secret court that handles intelligence matters , he said			0
if a phone number related to that investigation has links to a domestic phone number , " we 've got to go back to the court , " he said			0
but critics such as sen. @entity136 , a member of the @entity137 , had raised questions about the scale of the program even before @entity15 's leak			2
@entity136 told @entity143 's " @entity142 " on sunday that he does n't believe the program is making @entity16 any safer , " and i think it 's ultimately , perhaps , a violation of the @entity146			2
" " i think we owe it to the @entity16 people to have a fulsome debate in the open about the extent of these programs , " said @entity136 , @entity147			0
" you have a law that 's been interpreted secretly by a secret court that then issues secret orders to generate a secret program			0
i just do n't think this is an @entity16 approach to a world in which we have great threats			1
" but president @entity110 does not feel that he has violated the privacy of any @entity16 , his chief of staff , @entity165 , told @entity167 ' " @entity166			0
" @entity165 said the president will discuss the need to " find the right balance , especially in this new situation where we find ourselves with all of us reliant on @entity173 , on e-mail , on texting			0
" shortly after the stories broke , @entity110 publicly defended the @entity54 programs as " modest encroachments on privacy " that help prevent terrorism			0
@entity0 's @entity180 contributed to this report .			0
