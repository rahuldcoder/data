-- with ticket sales closing in on $ 100 million , the surprise hit of the year is " @entity3 , " a film about seven @entity6 retirees who travel to @entity7 to take up residence at the rundown @entity3 , which , according to its misleading brochures , will provide them with inexpensive comfort in their remaining years			1
but what makes " @entity3 , " which is directed by @entity12 of " @entity13 " fame , far more interesting than its box - office success is how it has defied the patronizing reviews of critics -- including those of @entity20 and @entity21 in @entity6 -- who have categorized it as little more than entertainment for people in their 50s starring actors in their 70s			1
indeed , how patronizing the critics have been is reflected in the fact that review after review , starting with " @entity3 " stars , @entity34 and @entity35 ( both of whom are 77 ) , has made a point of dwelling on the ages of the ensemble cast			1
the popularity of " @entity3 " tells us that unlike the critics , today 's audiences do n't find the struggles of the old and middle - aged less worthy of their attention than those of the young			1
but the charm of the film is n't confined to its depiction of the elderly trying to make the most of the rest of their lives			0
at the heart of " @entity3 " lies a compassion that contrasts starkly with the coldness the film 's retirees experienced in the @entity6 they left behind			1
the youthful manager of the @entity3 , played with comic brilliance by @entity63 ( the lead in " @entity65 " ) , may have misled his retirees about the quality of his hotel , but he has underplayed his own decency and enthusiasm			2
there is a long tradition in @entity6 literature of pointing up the failures of @entity76 society by contrasting life at home with life abroad			1
@entity81 's 1908 novel , " @entity80 , " which in 1985 was successfully adapted for the screen , provided a searing critique of the stuffiness of @entity86 life by allowing its young heroine to find romance in @entity89			0
" @entity3 , " which is based on @entity94 's 2004 novel , " @entity95 , " follows this same tradition , as it captures the @entity6 fascination with warm climates			1
in this case , however , the @entity98 novel with which " @entity3 " has the most in common is his 1924 masterpiece , " passage to @entity7			1
" in @entity81 's story it is the @entity7 , over whom the @entity76 then ruled , who show the greatest capacity for love and friendship			1
in " @entity3 , " the @entity6 retirees find a gentleness in the city of @entity112 that was not present in their homeland			2
in contrast to the @entity76 of the 19th century , the retirees of " @entity3 " are not out to extract fortunes from their new land			2
they are instead out to preserve dwindling incomes and make peace with their past			0
not all of them succeed , but enough of them do to suggest modern @entity7 , even with its traffic jams and elephants and camels in the streets , is a land of opportunity : @entity128 ( @entity34 ) , a housekeeper who after years of service was fired from her job by the family she worked for , finds that in @entity7 she can get the hip replacement surgery she needs without waiting and , despite herself , she slowly loses the racial bigotry she brought with her			0
@entity134 ( @entity35 ) , a widow whose husband has died , saddling her with debt that forces her to sell her home , gets employment helping out at an @entity7 call center and in the process frees herself from the condescending pity of her children			0
@entity143 ( @entity144 ) , a gay high court judge , who left @entity7 full of shame when he brought his young @entity7 lover into disgrace , finds that he is welcomed back as an old friend			0
@entity150 ( @entity151 ) , who has fled to @entity7 with his quarrelsome wife @entity152 ( @entity153 ) because their daughter lost most of their savings in a failed start - up , realizes that he is better off when his wife leaves him and returns to @entity6			2
the randy @entity160 ( @entity161 ) and the even randier @entity162 ( @entity163 ) learn that in @entity7 age is not the barrier it was in @entity6 to the sexual adventure they are seeking			2
can these happy endings last ? " @entity3 " never provides a final answer just as it rarely allows tragedy to creep in			0
but the " @entity3 " does not need to offer they - lived - happily - ever - after reassurance to succeed			0
it is enough that , thanks to their change in scenery , the film 's central characters have refused to resign themselves to ending their lives in quiet despair			0
what in 1947 on the eve of independence @entity7 's first prime minister , @entity185 , called his nation 's " @entity186 " has become for the retirees of the " @entity3 " a tryst with old age as a result of their new country and its people			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

despite patronizing critics , " @entity3 " is surprise hit movie of the year
@entity197 : movie 's popularity shows audiences do care about older people 's lives
@entity208 : @entity6 literature often points up failures of @entity76 society by contrasting life abroad
" @entity3 " reveals the compassion in @entity7 that was *lacking* in life in @entity6
