-- in - vitro fertilization is growing fast in @entity2 , a country where childlessness can be seen as a social failure , especially for women			1
@entity2 's first in - vitro fertilization clinic was only opened in 1999 , but there are now around 16 in the country			1
dr @entity8 , director of the @entity10 - based @entity9 , says he has a vision of making the treatment easily accessible			1
" where you have a marriage that 's not blessed with children there 's a lot of stigmatization , " says @entity8			1
" in fact , some people say infertility is a justifiable reason for divorce and a lot of marriages break up where there 's infertility , " he adds			2
@entity2 is @entity28 's most populous nation with some 150 million people , but it has a large fertility problem			1
the prevalence of infertility in @entity2 is about 25 % , compared to 10 to 15 % in the @entity33 and @entity34 , according to friday @entity35 , professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of @entity39 , in @entity2			1
@entity40 , the assisted reproductive technology that has helped countless couples around the world , is often unavailable or unaffordable in many developing countries			1
@entity8 , who used to live in the @entity34 , says that for many years the only option for childless @entity2 couples was to travel abroad to get treatment			1
" i was surprised by the large number of @entity2 that were constantly coming to the @entity34 for treatment and after a few years of watching them , my entrepreneurial nerve started to twitch and i thought to myself there 's a major opportunity in @entity2 , " he says			2
@entity8 returned to @entity2 to help set up its first @entity40 treatment clinic in 1999 and he now runs four @entity40 treatment clinics across the country			1
each of his clinics treats up to 700 patients a year , with what he says is a success rate of over 30 % for women under 36 years old			0
but overcoming these biological realities ultimately helps couples overcome the enormous social pressure as well			0
@entity66 , professor of anthropology and international affairs at @entity69 , says that in many developing nations the greatest social burden of infertility rests on the shoulders of married women , who are expected to become pregnant			0
they can experience " social scrutiny and ostracism " if they do n't have children , she says			0
" this is especially true in ' high - fertility ' societies of @entity28 , where infertile women suffer from ' barrenness amidst plenty , ' " explains @entity66 , who is co-author of " @entity80			0
" she says the social suffering associated with infertility seems to be worse when women are expected to have many children , and can lead to depression , despair , and threats of divorce			0
in @entity28 , many infertility problems in women are related to untreated or poorly treated reproductive tract infections , which could easily be prevented with early detection			2
however , @entity66 says most of the world 's infertility cases involve male infertility , which is a " hidden " and neglected reproductive health problem			0
" women often carry the burden of their husband 's infertility , even when they themselves are healthy and fertile , " she says			0
the @entity9 claims to have had 1,253 live births since 2000			0
treatment can cost up to $ 5,000 , since maintaining a professional standard in a country with a lack of trained @entity40 staff is not cheap			2
but healthcare , @entity8 says , is not about numbers			2
" it 's not just about making money , it 's about actually doing something worthwhile and having a clear vision to solve a problem that the country needs solving and at the same time building a institution that outlives me , " he says .			0

in @entity2 there can be a stigma attached to childless marriage

dr @entity8 is helping make @entity40 easily accessible in in @entity2
