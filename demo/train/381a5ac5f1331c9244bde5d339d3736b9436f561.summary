-- on sunday , just two days before the @entity2 , we witnessed yet another act of unspeakable violence aimed at dividing our communities along the lines of faith			1
the motivation for the shootings outside @entity10 is still under investigation , but we know that a white supremacist and former @entity14 leader is accused of shooting people outside a @entity16 and @entity17 , a retirement home			1
three people died in what is just the most recent deeply misguided act of violence aimed at severing the values each and every @entity24 cherishes most deeply			0
as we remember the lives taken a year ago in @entity26 , we also mourn and pray for the victims and their families in @entity10			1
one of us is a pastor and the other a rabbi of congregations in and near @entity26			1
we both had identical reactions when we first learned of the @entity35 bombings last year			0
was this another 9/11 ? whom did we know who might be directly affected -- runners , first responders , spectators on the finish line ? we worried about our colleagues at @entity44 , directly on the finish line , and @entity46 in @entity47 , one block away			0
similar to what we imagine interfaith leaders in @entity10 started to do sunday , we immediately began to call people and try to determine how to minister to our congregations and the city at large			1
we had both been involved in building relationships across religious lines for years ; under the auspices of the @entity58 and our individual efforts , we had joined together @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 to build bridges of respect , tolerance and affection			0
in the year that has followed the bombing , @entity67 of @entity26 was honored to host @entity70 of the @entity71 for a special service celebrating the rev. @entity74 's birthday			2
@entity70 was joined at the temple by more than 100 members of his own congregation and by exceptional clergy and congregants from @entity26 's @entity80 in a joint celebration of the vision of life			2
@entity70 will also be the featured speaker at @entity44 's evening of remembrance on tuesday night , which will honor the victims and brave first responders			0
the church will be filled with members of every faith from greater @entity26			1
if the goal of the tragedy in @entity26 or the most recent act of despicable violence in @entity10 is to sow fear and to divide us against one another , then our own lived experience is a testament to their failure			1
last year 's senseless attack has been repudiated by our congregations in the strongest and most profound way possible , and in the process we are stronger than ever			0
looking back , we can not help but recognize that by a combination of heroism , compassion , faith and will , the tragedy of the marathon bombing has brought us closer together and strengthened the ties between our communities			0
on the anniversary of last year 's terrible attack and the violence in @entity10 on sunday , all of our congregations stand united in praying for the victims , their families and those who were grievously injured			2
we can not bring back those people who were so senselessly taken , and we know that the void left by their loss can never truly be filled			2
we can not restore lost limbs or heal the physical wounds			0
however , we can choose a better future for ourselves and for our nation -- one grounded in our common humanity , and in our expressions of faith and hope for the future , whether we are @entity61 , @entity60 , jews , adherents of other faiths or secular citizens who share a commitment to repair and renew the health and well - being of our cities , nation and the world .			1

**writers** : like @entity26 bombings , @entity10 shootings meant to divide people along lines of faith
rabbi and minister from @entity26 remember how their community came together after bombings
**writers** : hate *crimes* do *n't* divide ; they bring all faiths together bonded by humanity
