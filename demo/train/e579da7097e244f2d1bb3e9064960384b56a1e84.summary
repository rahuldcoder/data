-- @entity1 should have been a rock star			1
remember him pounding his air guitar in not much more than a shirt and shades in " @entity5 " ? he turned a pool hall into a concert stage , strutting his stuff in " @entity9 , " shook his moneymaker under layers of latex at the end of " @entity14 " and took a chance , singing in his own voice in " @entity17 " and " @entity18			2
" he always had the moves , and more important , he had the self - belief			2
still , the challenge of a full - blown musical has apparently not been something he 's been in a hurry to tackle , perhaps wary of undercutting his action - man credentials			2
turns out , some things are worth waiting for			0
will audiences show up for ' @entity28 ' ? i do n't know how much they may have finessed his vocal tracks , and it does n't matter			1
he owns " @entity28 , " an addled tribute to ' 80s hair metal , from the very minute he appears			1
he emerges hazily from underneath layers of discarded groupies in a palatial hotel suite , sporting gunslinger body art and outrageous crotch jewelry , dispensing intensely eccentric , deeply fried philosophical nuggets before stumbling into the indoor @entity43			0
ladies and gents , meet @entity46 , @entity47			1
a caricature of already larger - than - life personalities @entity52 and @entity53 , @entity48 is very much a supporting character in @entity57 's @entity56 - winning 2009 musical			2
but he 's also the star of the show , the one everybody else is dying to see , to make or to emulate			0
@entity1 has the charisma to sell all that even as he shows us a boozed - up captive to celebrity , sex and ego			1
when he does perform , he 's electric			0
however , @entity1 is just as good in the dialogue scenes , whether it 's messing with club owner @entity68 's vulnerable brain or fending off an increasingly hot - under - the - collar " @entity69 " features writer ( @entity70 )			1
a karaoke musical in which almost everybody bursts into @entity75 anthems at the drop of a hat ( yes , even @entity68 , who duets with @entity79 on a camp rendition of @entity81 's " @entity71 " ) , by rights " @entity28 " should n't come off as a one - man show			1
but it 's an uneven fight , and you might find yourself itching for the fast - forward button whenever @entity1 is off - screen			1
@entity89 , who portrayed @entity90 in " footloose " and who appeared in the strikingly similar " burlesque , " plays the movie 's ostensible heroine , @entity94 , a small - town girl from @entity96 who gets off the bus in @entity98 ready to pursue her dream of being a singer			1
instead , she finds herself playing out a pg - 13 version of " showgirls , " waiting tables at the legendary rock club the @entity104 and falling in love with a co-worker , @entity107 ( @entity106 )			0
@entity107 's own singing aspirations get considerably more screen time than @entity94 's , but he still fails to make much impact			0
hilariously , within hours of meeting her , he claims to have been inspired to write " @entity112			0
" " it goes on and on , " he explains modestly after giving her a taste of the first verse			0
you could n't accuse the filmmakers of taking themselves -- or anything else -- too seriously			0
director @entity120 , the veteran choreographer who also directed " @entity121 " ( and a couple of episodes of " @entity124 " ) , encourages the cast to amp everything up to 11 , or in the case of @entity128 , 111			1
she plays the mayor 's wife , @entity130 , crusading to clean up the @entity132 and shut down the @entity104 for reasons more personal than political			0
all this sound and fury signifies next to nothing , and music fans may feel it 's a funny sort of tribute that mocks as much as it rocks			0
even so , it 's good to see @entity1 letting his hair down			1
it 's a fun show if you roll with it			0
' @entity28 ' : 8 fun facts about the movie 's costumes			2
