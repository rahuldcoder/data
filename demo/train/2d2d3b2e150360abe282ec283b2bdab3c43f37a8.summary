even among terrorism watchers , the @entity1 group @entity0 has not been a daily preoccupation			1
but on sunday this obscure cell found a 55 - year old @entity6 hiker , @entity5 , wandering in the rugged and beautiful @entity7 in central @entity1			1
the innocent mountaineering enthusiast provided the group with an opportunity to catapult itself onto the world stage and burnish its credentials as one of the ( relatively few ) jihadist groups to declare allegiance to @entity16 and the @entity17 in @entity18 and @entity19 ( @entity20 )			1
its leader , @entity21 , had declared @entity0 's loyalty to @entity20 earlier this month ; the name means " soldiers of the @entity26			1
" ( there are other groups with the same name in @entity30 and @entity31			0
) in carrying out its threat to behead @entity5 , the group said it was responding to an appeal by @entity20 spokesman @entity35 to kill " the spiteful and filthy @entity6 " because of their support for military action against the group			1
a video message showing the execution was designed to resemble those carried out by @entity20 , as were the words of one of the militants , who said : " let the @entity6 people know that their blood is cheap for their president , and it is the same as you made the blood of the @entity54 women and children cheap in @entity18 and @entity56 ( @entity19 )			1
" so does that mean that @entity20 ' message spreading like wildfire across the @entity60 ? and what does @entity5 's tragic murder tell us about a more general threat to @entity65 ? @entity0 is no isis			1
it is a small splinter group of @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , an @entity67 affiliate prone to disunity			0
@entity21 , sentenced to death by @entity1 in 2012 , was the commander of @entity66 's central region			2
by then , he 'd been an active in the militant @entity72 insurgency in @entity1 for 12 years			2
he said his fighters were abandoning @entity66 because of " the certain deviation of the methods of the mother organization @entity67 , and that of the @entity60			0
" @entity0 holds no territory and can not threaten @entity1 's main cities -- though occasional suicide attacks can not be ruled out -- let alone launch attacks beyond @entity1			1
@entity6 intelligence analysts say there are plenty of such groups roaming the densely - forested mountains , beyond the authority of the state , some mixing jihad with banditry and smuggling			2
their main threat is to @entity1 troops : @entity0 killed 10 soldiers in an ambush in april close to where @entity5 was seized			1
it is not the first -- and likely will not be the last -- jihadist outfit to quit @entity67 for the millennarian message of @entity16			0
this week , a group of the same name in @entity31 declared its allegiance to the @entity20 leader as the @entity102 and threatened attacks on @entity105 diplomatic missions			1
a group of jihadists in @entity108 made the same pledge last week ; so did a group in @entity111			0
so far none of the big fish among @entity67 's affiliates have gone over to @entity20			2
but in a joint statement , @entity66 and @entity115 have expressed solidarity with the people of @entity19 and @entity18 in the face of @entity105 military action -- while studiously avoiding any expression of support for @entity20			2
that 's not to say that smaller groups like @entity0 are irrelevant			2
@entity20 can use their declarations as propaganda , ' evidence ' that its path is the true one and the tide is flowing in its favor			2
some analysts see a " bidding war " developing among these groups and cells , as they seek attention and support			0
@entity138 , who runs the @entity139 , says the murder of @entity5 poses a challenge to @entity66			0
" will it ratchet up its activities to reclaim primacy among the @entity60 's jihadi groups ? will it condemn the kidnapping as futile and reckless ? will it try to pull @entity151 back into its fold ? " he asks			0
and even if @entity0 's reach is limited , other militants might be tempted to follow its example -- hence the announcement by the @entity6 government of preventive security measures thursday in the wake of @entity5 's killing			1
there is one other takeaway from the murder of @entity5			0
it is another sign that an ever - growing ' arc ' of territory is now too perilous for even the most adventurous of travelers : from the @entity168 coast of @entity169 through the @entity60 , much of the @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity108 and on to @entity111			0
the famous @entity173 - to - @entity174 motorized rally was abandoned in 2008 because of security threats and moved to @entity176 ; backpackers have long since crossed the scenic @entity178 in @entity111 off their list			0
more recently the fabled city of @entity181 in @entity182 saw multiple abductions of @entity65 by terrorist groups , excursions to @entity187 's monastery in @entity31 's @entity188 were halted earlier this year after a bomb attack , and the beautiful coastline of northern @entity191 has become a virtual no - go zone thanks to raids by @entity194			0
even well - protected commercial ventures , like the uranium mine in @entity197 owned by @entity6 company @entity198 and the @entity200 refinery in southern @entity1 , have been subject to terror attacks			1
many travelers will now add to that list the breathtaking scenery of the @entity206 mountains in @entity1 .			0

before sunday , the @entity1 group @entity0 was little known
the *videotaped* beheading of a @entity6 hiker *changed* that
the group cited an appeal by @entity20 spokesman @entity35
that appeal was for @entity20 followers to kill " the spiteful and filthy @entity6 "
