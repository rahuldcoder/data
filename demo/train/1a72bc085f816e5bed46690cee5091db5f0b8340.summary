-- if he had been listening from his car monday morning , radio veteran @entity1 knew what he would have thought of a bit mocking a former @entity6 @entity5 now battling @entity8 's disease			1
" i would have been offended			0
" why ? the now former host of " @entity10 " on @entity12 's @entity11 offered up plenty of reasons in an interview tuesday with @entity0 's @entity16			1
and none of his descriptions of the now infamous two - minute radio bit were positive			1
" you walk a fine line trying to be somewhat on the edge , " @entity1 said			0
we blew it in a huge way			0
" @entity1 and the show 's two other hosts -- @entity29 and @entity30 -- were fired monday evening			1
it all started , he explained , as the show 's crew batted around ideas during a commercial break			0
the @entity36 are big in @entity37 , and the @entity38 are likely their biggest rivals			0
and it just so happened that @entity40 , one of the men most associated with the @entity43 team , had been the guest writer for @entity45 's popular " monday morning quarterback " column this week on @entity46			1
but @entity40 is n't just any @entity5			1
he 's a hero in @entity6 not just for his play as a defensive back but , more recently , for his battle against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a neuromuscular disease also known by its acronym als and as @entity8 's disease			1
the illness has hindered many of @entity40 's functions , but it has n't stopped him			1
to put together the column , he pointed out , he used technology that allowed him to type with his eyes			0
@entity40 also explained his struggles with , and triumphs over , the disease			1
" @entity64 prevents your brain from talking to your muscles			1
as a result , muscles die			0
as a result , every 90 minutes people die , " he wrote			0
" i am a person			0
" the " mayhem in the am " crew decided to spoof @entity40 's illness , specifically , the fact he speaks with a synthetic voice			1
the segment featured punchlines of an imaginary @entity40 telling knock - knock jokes , using a would - be synthesizer , with punchlines like " smother me , do me a favor			1
" on tuesday , @entity1 offered no defense for the segment , which he described as quickly conceived and ill - advised			2
at the outset , he realized the bit was n't funny but was n't prepared as it quickly got slammed on social media and beyond			2
" the pressure is to try to do a good radio show , and that was n't a good moment , " @entity1 recalled			2
" it was a horrible moment			0
" within hours , the radio station and its parent company had suspended @entity30 , @entity29 and @entity1			1
by day 's end , they were all out of a job			0
" 790 @entity11 , our owners , sponsors and partners in no way endorse or support this kind of content			0
we sincerely apologize to mr. @entity40 , his family and all those touched by @entity64 , " @entity109 , the station 's general manager , said in a statement all three hosts have apologized on @entity114 and personally to the @entity116 foundation , as @entity40 himself wrote on @entity118			1
" received and accepted , " he wrote			0
" we have all made mistakes in this life			0
how we learn from our mistakes is the measure of who we are			2
" since the story broke , @entity40 said , there 's been a lot of talk about @entity64 , an ailment he characterizes as being " not ( well ) understood ... and largely ignored			1
" hopefully , this unintentional uproar will help change that , he said			0
that 's @entity1 's hope as well			0
at the same time , he 's personally shaken for his part in offending so many -- including @entity40 , those fighting @entity64 and the @entity6			1
the 18 - year radio veteran knows @entity6 well : he attended @entity135 , was married in the city and even has a daughter named @entity6			1
" it 's a place i understand their passions and their heroes , " @entity1 said , counting @entity40 as one such hero			2
" and to make fun of those , it 's an awful thing			0
i feel awful about it			0
" outrage over radio hosts ' comments is hardly unprecedented , especially in a " shock jock " age in which some push the line in order to entertain listeners			2
and sometimes the hosts get fired			2
that 's what happened when @entity160 and @entity160 's " @entity160 " show got pulled in 2002 for a stunt in which they broadcast descriptions of people having sex in public places , including @entity168 's @entity167			0
five years later , @entity169 abruptly ended @entity171 ' radio show after his remarks about @entity174 's women 's basketball program that some deemed racist and sexist			2
both @entity171 and " @entity160 " are still in the radio business and have nationwide followings			2
more recently , two popular @entity178 radio djs made headlines for a prank call targeting a pregnant @entity181 of @entity182 that was followed by the suicide of a nurse fooled by their call			2
those radio hosts were suspended , not fired			1
that 's what should have happened to @entity191 , @entity29 and @entity1 , according to @entity193 radio host @entity192 of @entity6 , where he says " @entity40 is an icon			1
" @entity192 is an accomplished actor , winning three emmy awards as @entity197 's love interest , talk show host @entity198 , on " @entity200			2
" he also worked on " cheers , " playing hockey star @entity202 , husband of @entity204 's @entity203			0
@entity192 -- who admits being a " huge @entity38 fan " who does n't like @entity12 -- believes 790 the @entity208 's management overreacted to " a bad joke			1
" he noted that tv shows such as " @entity211 " have repeatedly featured caricatures of @entity213 , who also has als and uses a synthetic voice , in its shows with no equivalent uproar			1
the @entity12 saga would have ended better if the fired radio hosts , after being suspended for some time , had returned to talk about @entity64 with @entity40 and raised money for the cause , said @entity192			1
" that was a dumb thing to say , but no one is yelling for them to get fired , " @entity192 told @entity0			2
" ... it 's a terrible thing , a stupid thing			0
but yeah , you make mistakes			0
" @entity0 's @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this report .			0
