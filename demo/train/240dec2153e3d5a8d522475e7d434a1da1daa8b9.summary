their head - to - head record suggests @entity1 should be the heavy favorite			2
he leads @entity14 , a 6 - 3 6 - 2 winner over second - seed @entity56 on saturday , 14 - 0			1
@entity43 in @entity58 final @entity59 in @entity13 benefits from a roof but it 's not the case at the @entity63 in @entity58 , and the other men 's @entity5 warm - up this week has been affected by adverse weather			1
more rain saturday led to both semifinals being delayed , with organizers eventually shifting one to an outer court			0
