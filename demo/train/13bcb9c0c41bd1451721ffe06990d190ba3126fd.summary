-- @entity1 is on a mission to find love , and it 's the kind that has a countdown and can be monitored by any curious voyeur			1
no , she 's not the newest bachelorette to feed @entity9 's reality tv addiction			2
the @entity11 media consultant is the brains and heart behind " 52 weeks 2 find him ! " a web site dedicated to the search for her husband			1
" this whole process has been me really realizing i need to find new ways to be proactive , " said @entity1 , 43 , who might typically get roped into long hours at work or the embrace of a comfortable couch			1
" i 'm past the stage of believing it 'll just happen			2
" so she 's putting it all out there on her site			1
she 's asking friends and strangers to weigh in with advice			1
she 's pushing herself to do things and act in ways she never has before			2
and a little more than 14 weeks into the self - imposed challenge , she 's pretty exhausted			1
" i ca n't believe how hard it is , " she said of the journey so far , which has brought her more dates in two months than she 'd had in two years			2
" but that 's why the deadline is so important			1
" setting goals and working hard -- no doubt , it 's the @entity9 way			1
singles scramble to avoid renewing online dating subscriptions			2
they sign up for " speed dating " events to feast on a smorgasbord of quick - and - easy first impressions			1
tv viewers beat up " the bachelor " when he regrets selecting the mate he 's chosen after a limited number of episodes			2
and how - to books that promise , within a set timeframe , discovery of the one , fly off bookshelves			1
when it comes to matters of the heart , though , does finding love on a deadline make sense ? " it sounds good from a marketing standpoint , but life does n't work like that , " said @entity67 , " the @entity68 , " who coaches people when it comes to matters of the heart			1
about five years ago , when she was 27 , @entity67 posted a site called " @entity77 , " with the hope -- albeit somewhat in jest -- that she 'd be engaged within six months			1
like @entity1 , she felt that setting aside time to focus on her personal life was necessary			1
" it 's ok to say , ' i want to be a partner in a law firm in three years ' ... but we 're taught to not be open about our desires about marriage , because we do n't want to scare off the guy , " she said			0
by being honest , " you end up attracting men who want the same thing as you			0
" a funny thing happened along the way , though			0
@entity67 found " my one , " as she calls him , ended up living with the guy and felt essentially married			0
but she walked away when she realized that she had n't taken time to know herself			1
she was young , caught up in the societal pressures and so worried about finding him that she 'd never bothered to look within			0
through self - discovery , she fell " totally in love with myself , " she said			1
" now , i 'm ready for a partner in my life again , but there 's no rush ; there 's no urgency ; there 's no fear			0
" and nothing is more attractive than a woman who is happy with herself , said @entity110 , a " @entity111 " based in @entity112 , @entity113			2
he said that putting a deadline on the search for love sounds like " a risky approach " and that allowing time for self - evaluation is most important , no matter the gender			1
to get where he is , personally and professionally , he had to examine and fix his own mindset when it came to love and romance			0
" i used to see an ice queen , and i 'd run and impale myself on her cold , bitter heart , " said @entity110 , 35 , who 's engaged to be married next year			0
" now i have the loveliest , warmest woman i 've ever met			2
in helping myself , i 've ended up helping other people			0
" for 23 years , @entity128 has been offering her own brand of assistance by way of an evening course offered at @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135			0
it was traditionally called " i will be married in one year , " but the psychotherapist has changed the course name in recent years to better represent her curriculum and those she wants to reach , including gays and lesbians who ca n't marry : " @entity143 : the @entity144			0
" too many people are caught up in the fantasy of how love works and happens , she said			0
they are prepared to work hard on the job or in school , but they have n't done their homework to achieve true and lasting love			0
women , for example , think that outward appearances will reel men in , but men do n't give enough attention to how they look , she said			0
and simple things , like making a conscious effort to smile more often , can make a difference			1
get advice from matchmakers on what to wear , where to go " women who do n't smile are perceived as hostile			0
women perceive men who do n't smile as being unsafe , " @entity128 said			0
" but of course , your best smilers in the world are sociopaths , " she added			0
though " love does n't have a time limit on it , " @entity128 said giving people time constraints can be important , especially if what they need to do is some of the hard , looking - within kind of work			1
if people were told to spend five years on this process , they 'd wait until year four to focus , she said			0
" you have to give people deadlines			2
" and it 's the deadline of 52 weeks that works for @entity1 , who had never allowed herself this time to focus on her heart and the search for love			1
this " grand effort , " as she calls it , is simply her attempt to see whether she can add to what is already " a full life " and one that she loves			0
if she does n't find him by the end of the year , she 's prepared to take a year off to re-evaluate where she is			2
" at that point , i 'll probably need a year off from dating , " she said with a laugh .			0

a woman sets up a web site for help in her 52 - week search to find @entity206
" @entity68 " and " @entity208 " weigh in : does setting deadlines make sense ?
*experts* say loving oneself should come first , and fantasies need to go
setting aside time to do self - examination is a , however , a deadline worth making
