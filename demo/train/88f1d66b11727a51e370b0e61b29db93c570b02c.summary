in an op - ed on @entity2 , @entity0 suggested that it is easy to accidentally land an airplane at the wrong airport			1
the problem is that it should n't be , especially not with the profusion of technology at a pilot 's fingertips designed to help prevent just these kinds of mistakes			2
no doubt @entity14 's landing at the wrong @entity17 airport this week will be categorized as pilot error , as it was when a 747 crew landed at the wrong airport in @entity20 in november			1
but labeling this all as an easy mistake or as pilot error is too simplistic			2
in doing so , we risk ignoring a growing threat to this nation 's and the world 's aviation safety , a growing disconnect between the technology created by our smartest engineers and technicians and the pilots who use it			1
indeed , pilots sometimes ignore the technology , as @entity0 and others have speculated could have been the case in the @entity14 landing , while others are overwhelmed when the technology unexpectedly fails , like it did aboard the doomed @entity40 that crashed in the ocean in 2009			1
@entity42 is good at fixing problems , though			0
when an airliner flying in the clouds on approach to @entity48 struck the top of a hill after descending too low , @entity42 industry developed a fix : a ground proximity warning system , a talking cockpit box that alerts pilots to approaching hazards they could n't easily see			2
but in 2012 , a @entity57 airline crew demonstrating a new jet received a terrain warning -- an aural cockpit signal warning the crew they were too close to the ground -- flying around @entity63 , but ignored it , believing it was a computer error			1
all 44 people aboard that aircraft died when the airplane struck the side of a mountain			0
the computer 's warning had been real			1
in february 2009 , the captain of a @entity74 turboprop became confused when the autopilot of his airplane turned itself off while the airplane was slowing for the approach to @entity78 , @entity79			0
the pilot was so startled by the computer shutdown that he made a fatal flying mistake			2
he also believed the computer 's messages were a mistake			1
forty - nine people in that airplane died because the pilot was wrong			1
all these aircraft were equipped with the latest technologies available to make flight as safe as humanly possible			0
and yet each time , the crew managed to figure out a way not to heed the warnings			2
the @entity14 and the @entity96 pilots -- and their passengers , of course -- were just lucky no one was hurt			1
but what about the next time ? the @entity14 crew only averted disaster by a few hundred feet , narrowly missing a drop - off at the end of the runway that would surely have broken the airplane into many pieces			1
all these problems point to this newest threat : pilot 's confusion about what their computers are telling them , when they look at them , that is			1
this speaks to complacency to some extent			0
it 's also well known that humans do n't handle monitoring duties very well for very long			0
we grow bored rather easily			0
but even labeling this a " human factors " problem is too easy			0
like everything in our society these days , this complacency , this disconnect between operator and computer , is not a simple black and white problem that we can fix with another electronic box or an enthusiastic chat from the boss			2
there 's another overriding problem preventing us from digging deeply enough into the implications of this problem : the airline industry has become a victim of its own success , with an impressive air safety record			0
before last year 's crashes in @entity148 and @entity149 , @entity150 , there had been not a single fatality between 2010 and 2012			0
because our record has been so good , many people inside and outside the industry , as well as legislators , regulators and certainly airline passengers may mistakenly believe that we 've solved the aviation safety problem			0
but just as hospital administrators would never tell patients that losing a few people now and again to infection should be considered an acceptable loss , we ca n't ignore the instances when something has come between our professional pilots and these technologies created to help save us from ourselves			0
and we in the industry are only now coming to believe this threat is real ourselves			0
a recent study delivered to the @entity171 about automation confusion highlights some of these problems , but offered no timeline to solve them			1
passengers also need to advocate for their own safety by writing to their legislators , airline ceos and regulators demanding that the automation confusion issue be put on the front burner now			1
like our pilots , aviation safety 's threats are sending us warning messages			2
but right now we do n't seem to be listening .			0

@entity188 : writer suggested it 's easy to land jet at wrong airport . @entity193 , with a *caveat*
@entity14 landing joins similar cases from recent years . these should raise alarm , he says
he says pilots often failed to heed what computer was telling them . complacency a threat
@entity188 : fliers should demand " automation confusion " be put on regulators ' front - burner
