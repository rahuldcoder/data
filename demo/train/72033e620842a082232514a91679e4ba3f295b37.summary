dramatic scenes ended a tense hostage situation early tuesday in @entity2 , with sounds of an explosion and gunfire as @entity7 police stormed a cafe where a gunman had hours earlier taken more than 10 people hostage			1
" the whole moment seemed to begin by the escape by our count of six or seven hostages ; they ran out from the right - hand side of the cafe and flew down the steps and into the arms of the waiting police , " @entity12 reporter @entity11 told @entity13			1
" at that point there were a couple of minutes of silence , a police unit moved in ; we could see them in dark uniforms , night - vision goggles on , looking toward the door			1
there was a shot fired -- we think that at that point that it was the gunman firing a shot			0
we heard from one police officer saying that a hostage was down and at that point the police moved in , " @entity11 said			1
" we saw a lot of explosive material -- flash bangs as they 're called , stun grenades to try to disrupt and startle the gunman as police units moved in from both sides of the cafe to try to get him before he could do any further damage			1
" live footage from the scene later showed heavily armed police running toward the @entity53 before at least four people were carried away on stretchers			2
@entity12 reporter @entity55 said the scene had been quiet for several hours before police swarmed the area			2
" all of a sudden , gunfire , heavily armed police officers -- police en masse -- and those hostages ( were ) beginning to be brought out , " he said			1
on any ordinary workday , the scene in @entity2 would have been packed with people crisscrossing @entity67 on their way to work , home and shops			1
but this week before @entity72 , the inner - city streets fell silent			1
" it is eerily quiet for the center of the city , which is normally humming with traffic and pedestrians			2
... people would be normally walking the streets			2
they 've roped off several blocks around @entity67 , " said @entity13 's @entity80 , who was about a block from the scene			2
@entity67 is a paved traffic - free zone , a pedestrian - friendly promenade a few blocks from the ferry terminal at @entity88			2
it 's where people go to meet , have coffee and catch a train			2
heavily armed police outside the @entity100 shop , heavily armed police , some in camouflage gear and armed with sniper rifles , had taken positions as negotiators attempted to talk to the man inside , since identified as man @entity104 , also known as @entity105 , a self - styled @entity106 cleric			1
passers - by were herded back behind police barriers , while surrounding buildings were evacuated			1
opposite the @entity100 shop is the entrance to the @entity67 underground train station , where trains stopped running during the siege			0
beyond the train station are the studios of @entity7 network @entity12 , whose huge glass windows act as the backdrop for early - morning programming , and where crowds are encouraged to gather			0
in the early hours of the standoff , the network , a @entity13 affiliate , turned its cameras around to film across the street			0
it captured the images that @entity12 producer @entity129 described as " shocking and chilling			0
" " people were putting their hands up against the panes of glass at the cafe			0
this was just extraordinary , " @entity129 told the @entity135 moments later a black flag bearing white @entity139 writing was pressed against the window , drawing gasps from the newsroom , he said			0
" we 've shut off the monitors that face onto @entity67 for fear that people inside the cafe might be able to see the pictures broadcast , " @entity129 said at the time			0
picture emerging of alleged hostage - taker ' surreal ' scene few live images of the cafe were broadcast amid police warnings not to disclose operational matters			1
@entity158 reporter @entity157 described the scene as " very surreal			0
" " there are literally hundreds or thousands of people wandering around with this expression of bewilderment , " he told @entity161 radio station			0
" we ca n't believe this is happening			0
" he said hundreds , if not thousands , of people had assembled in nearby @entity169 after being told to leave the area around @entity67			0
@entity157 recounted a conversation he had with two @entity173 tourists who said , " we thought @entity2 was safe			1
" it was a sentiment that was apparent in the street and on social media			0
while @entity7 's operating under a " high " terror alert , a high - profile attack in @entity2 's central business district was unexpected and unprecedented			1
authorities are not explicitly referring to the incident as a " terror attack , " but @entity185 police commissioner @entity184 said police are on " a footing that would be consistent with a terrorist alert			1
" @entity2 residents expressed their shock and dismay			1
" it 's probably the first time in @entity7 history that something this major in regards to a terrorist threat has happened , " @entity192 told @entity193			0
' high ' terror alert the hostage situation follows dozens of police terror raids in the city that have strained relations with the local @entity106 community			1
amid reports that as many as 100 @entity7 had left the country to support @entity211 ' quest to create a so - called @entity212 , authorities introduced tough new terror laws			0
the new regulations give authorities the power to imprison people for " advocating terrorism			0
" they also criminalize travel to areas deemed by @entity7 's foreign minister as " no - go " zones , and impose stiff penalties for @entity7 citizens who leave the country to engage in foreign wars			1
in september , prime minister @entity228 raised the country 's terror threat level to " high " but said there had been " no specific intelligence of particular plots			2
" " what we do have is intelligence that there are people with the intent and capability to mount attacks , " @entity228 said			0
a week later , he announced a terror plot to decapitate members of the public had been foiled .			0
