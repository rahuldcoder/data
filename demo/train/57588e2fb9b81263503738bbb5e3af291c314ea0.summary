editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity4 contributor , is a longtime political consultant who was a member of the media team for president @entity7 's 1996 re-election campaign			1
@entity2 was a media consultant for @entity10 's campaign for @entity12 attorney general in 1998 and has represented candidates around the country and the world			1
he represented rep. @entity16 , a @entity17 whose name has been mentioned for the @entity12 senate seat , in 2000 , but has n't had a business relationship with him since			2
@entity2 , who also represents corporate clients , does not represent any of the other politicians whose names have been mentioned for the @entity25 seat			1
for a rival view , read here			0
@entity2 says @entity27 has n't earned the nod for a @entity25 seat from @entity12			1
@entity30 ( @entity4 ) -- judging by the screaming newspaper headlines and the steamy ecstasy of the gossip columns , people from other worlds might presume that it has already come to pass : that a woman who happens to be named @entity27 was pole - vaulted above the crowd and sent with magic wand and golden slippers to the @entity25 from @entity12 , in the hope of saving the @entity42 and bringing goodness to all its inhabitants			1
after all , why should n't she be sent to the @entity25 ? her unique experience of writing a book or two , smiling well , appearing from time to time -- but not too often -- at city mayoral news conferences announcing help for those who attend @entity30 public schools -- and , well , just being a @entity27 -- should suffice			1
her social standing alone , some might argue , would give her the advantage of all advantages			0
ah ! the greatness of it all ? not			0
the man who has to make the decision whether or not @entity12 is to be so vaunted in representation is gov. @entity62 , the former lieutenant governor who had the fortune of replacing morally triangulated gov. @entity10 after @entity10 's resignation in the face of a publicly humiliating sex scandal			1
@entity62 will have to face the voters in 2010			1
so will his pick to fill the seat that will be left vacant after @entity70 is confirmed as secretary of state in early 2009			2
the governor 's poll numbers suggest that voters like him			2
@entity62 has taken a tack much unexpected by challenging all to tighten belts , cut spending , pay more fees to the state and get rid of waste after @entity82 's collapse and the subsequent free fall in tax collections from the financial services business			1
@entity62 could have a tough time			2
voters do n't like losing money , they hate losing services , and all the earnest explanations about fighting the good fight together wo n't put better food on the table or pay the bills			2
he needs someone who can help him win , and he needs someone who can win			0
he and the senator he chooses will both face the voters together			2
with that in mind , is @entity27 the correct choice ? on the issues of the day , @entity27 has been mighty silent			2
financial cretins stealing for fun , profit and because they can ? not a word			0
millions of humans evaporated in @entity112 's inner madness ? quiet and silent			0
the auto bailout ? @entity114			0
the printing of a trillion soon - to - be inflated dollars that will further sap our savings ? on such matters , @entity27 remains absolutely silent			0
what about the destruction of the economy of western @entity12 ? does she know that there is a deeply pained world beyond the @entity126 border just a bit north of @entity30 that benefited little from some fairy - tale place called @entity56 and less from well - orchestrated and timed public relations campaigns afforded only by the rich ? why should @entity27 be named a @entity130 senator ? is it because merit no longer matters ? surely , @entity27 offers the dazzle of an unmistakable surname and the kind of celebrity appeal that seems to follow members of the @entity12 social elite			0
but for the white ethnics who gave their vote to @entity143 on the promise of fairness and merit , @entity27 's star quality may not suffice			1
the simple fact is that if the governor passes on other options -- candidates , many of whom serve in @entity154 and have earned their right to represent @entity12 -- then he does so at his own risk			0
in 1964 , @entity157 wanted then - sen. @entity159 's job so badly that he ran for office			0
president @entity162 's landslide victory in @entity12 helped @entity27 win the election , but not before the challenger ran a campaign that made its appeal to voters and proved worthy			1
his niece has done neither			0
if @entity27 wants to be @entity12 's junior senator , she should stand in line and run for office in 2010			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : some *treating* @entity27 's @entity25 bid as a done deal
he says @entity27 has n't been vocal on many of the key issues we face
@entity2 : what qualifies @entity27 to be given priority for the vacant seat ?
he says gov. @entity62 has to worry about facing voters in 2010
