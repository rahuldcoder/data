" they 're trying to get a message to the employer that this is serious stuff , " @entity28 added			0

" part of the dispute revolves around the definition of the workweek			0

but in 2012 , the racing association changed the workweek to reflect @entity3 's wednesday through sunday race schedule , eliminating weekend overtime pay			1
" this change resulted in a drastic reduction in their take - home pay , " @entity28 said			0
@entity38 workers at @entity3 have also had to start paying into their health insurance benefits and are no longer given retiree medical benefits , he added			2
in the statement , @entity24 officials responded that " local 3 is unwilling to pay a reasonable share of the cost to provide these benefits and they refuse to work with us to create shifts that reflect the reality of how a race track operates			2
" @entity28 would not comment on the likelihood of a strike this weekend but said that the union " is not one to frivolously go out on strike			0
" " ( the @entity24 ) took the position that it 's our way or the highway when they implemented these unilateral changes , " he said			0
" the workers are not going to accept that			0
