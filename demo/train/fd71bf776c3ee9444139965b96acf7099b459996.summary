-- what role did @entity1 play in the operation against @entity4 ? i would be surprised if @entity1 played a significant role in the operation to apprehend and kill @entity4 , based on the fact that the drone strikes that the @entity12 conduct in the tribal areas are done covertly , the authorities in @entity1 are not informed until the very last minute , because of the fear of information leaks			1
an operation of this scale in the central urban heartland of @entity1 would mean that information would be kept on a need - to - know basis			1
only a few people within the @entity23 would have known about this operation , it would definitely not have gone out to another country 's intelligence agency , especially when there 's so little trust with the @entity29 , the @entity1 intelligence service ]			1
there has been a deterioration in relations at a strategic level -- the @entity29 leaked out the name of the @entity23 station chief in @entity36 , and a person working out of the @entity12 embassy was detained by the @entity1 authorities , allegedly working for the @entity23			1
the fact that the @entity12 has been conducting drone strikes is an illustration of the fact that there has been little cooperation -- if not none -- with the @entity1 authorities			1
we 've seen the evolution of relations between @entity1 and @entity12 go from ' frenemies ' to outright enemies			1
historically , have the @entity12 and @entity1 had good ties ? the relationship has always been problematic , flawed , lacking trust			1
it goes back to during the time of the @entity58 occupation of @entity59 : the @entity12 and the @entity60 turned to @entity1 to provide and assist the @entity61 in removing the @entity58 from @entity59			1
there was a strategic relationship , but following the @entity58 leaving @entity59 , that relationship went into suspension			0
it was only restarted following 9/11 : the @entity67 turned to general @entity68 , the military ruler of @entity1 , who at that time had become a social pariah			1
he was asked to round up the leadership of @entity71 , of the @entity72 , to prevent them from creating an infrastructure inside @entity1			1
in return @entity1 would be rewarded with generous aid from the @entity12 and other countries			1
@entity68 was very skilled at saying all the right things , but doing virtually nothing , and that scenario continued , from 9/11 , right up to the end of @entity68 's tenure as ruler of @entity1 in 2007			1
it took a long time but the @entity12 finally began to realise that the promises the @entity1 were making were empty promises : nothing of real tangible significance was achieved			2
information that was being shared ended up being passed on to @entity71 , and counterterrorism operations were therefore flawed			0
the @entity91 disagreed with the @entity67 on issues like @entity93 , @entity94 , but the one issue they absolutely built upon was on the drone strikes policy , because if they could n't deal with @entity71 on the ground , they would try to tackle them from the skies			0
drone strikes were increased substantially under the @entity91 , because there was this lack of trust			2
the perception was that the @entity12 would support @entity1 publicly while pressurising them privately			2
over time we 've seen the public support wane			0
secretary of state @entity111 , in @entity1 last year , made it clear that she could not believe that the authorities in @entity1 did not know where @entity4 was			1
what has the reaction been in the region to news of @entity4 's death ? keep in mind the fact that there are protests when drone strikes take place in the tribal areas			1
this operation to take out @entity4 was near the urban heartland of @entity129			2
this is the core of where the military establishment is from , so there is going to be a falling out			0
publicly , the @entity1 will try to make out that they were aware of the operation , and that they played a role in it			2
privately , they will be seething that this was done on their territory			0
and there will be protests			2
the radicals and the extremists inside @entity1 -- whose infrastructure has not been dismantled , as @entity68 had promised -- they will organize mass protests			1
there will be propaganda by the radicals and the extremists to try and exploit the situation			0
@entity12 interests , @entity12 personnel , @entity12 embassies and consulates will have to take extra precautions			0
if @entity4 's death is of symbolic seismic significance , then the fallout in @entity1 will be equally matched			1
there is always a reaction			0
but keep in mind that the reaction may not come from @entity71 -- it may come from an affiliate , from the groups that have emerged or are emerging from @entity71 's shadows : @entity164 , the @entity1 @entity72 , @entity165			2
these groups have the infrastructure , the resources , the personnel and the desire to plot and plan mass casualty attacks , and they may be in a better position than @entity4 's @entity71 to carry out a reprisal attack			1
will @entity4 's death have a wider impact ? @entity175 is not the group it once was : the drone strikes have been confining their operational space , one by one the leadership has been picked off , they do n't have the ability to train people from the @entity60 as they once could			1
their resources are depleted , they are not able to replenish their ranks , so @entity175 central may not be able to cause a significant reaction , but other groups are potentially in a better position to do it			0
there will be problems that will emerge from this -- the worry is that we do n't know potentially what they could be , or when			0
the silence is going to be the greatest fear , because it 's not necessarily that these groups would want to carry out attacks regionally or globally imminently			0
they may wait , they may bide their time			0
we 're talking about weeks , months			0
@entity175 's affiliates have always had very long term thinking -- it 's not about today or tomorrow , it 's about next year			0
they wo n't necessarily want to carry out something that will fail and humiliate the group further			0
we also have to bear in mind that @entity4 has been killed , but his deputy , @entity209 is still at large			2
he has very much taken on the mantle of issuing @entity71 's messages : audio , video , through the internet ; and his protégé , @entity212 is also out there			0
they will certainly be issuing a message at some point , trying to create a rallying call for vengeance , to inspire their adherents and followers to take up arms			0
@entity4 may be dead , but his ideology still lives , and the message will continue to indoctrinate young , impressionable minds across the world .			2

@entity231 : @entity1 authorities will have been kept in the dark because of a lack of trust
protests and propaganda set to follow the death of @entity4 , he says
@entity231 : *retaliation* attacks are likely , but may not happen immediately .
