-- @entity1 and @entity2 have never met			1
but they are connected in a way that may help provide each of them with an answer to the same question : could strewn pieces of metal recently found partially buried in the sandy ocean floor 20 miles off the coast of @entity13 , @entity14 , be what 's left of a plane that disappeared without a trace 16 years ago ? the story begins on february 17 , 1996			1
that 's the day @entity2 's father , @entity19 , an experienced pilot , took off on a short solo flight from @entity21 , @entity22 , to @entity23 , @entity24			1
@entity19 was returning home after going to show his twin engine propeller - driven @entity26 to a prospective buyer who , as it so happened , failed to show up for the scheduled appointment			2
shortly after he took off around 7:45 p.m. , @entity19 , 58 , reported feeling dizzy and said he was having trouble seeing			0
he radioed a distress call and advised the radio control tower in @entity34 , @entity14 , of his coordinates			1
in what would be his last communication , he said he was placing the plane on autopilot and turning toward the ocean			1
though never certain , the family believes @entity19 , realizing his predicament and unable to control the light transport aircraft , wanted to steer the plane away from land and avoid hurting anyone			2
if her father was unconscious , @entity2 , who was 24 at the time , theorizes , his body might have shifted against the controls , putting the plane down off the coast near @entity34			1
two fighter jets were scrambled from a @entity55 base at @entity56 , @entity24 , and got close enough to see the plane but could n't see inside the cockpit			2
the fighters ran low on fuel and turned around			0
despite a lengthy aerial and water search by the @entity64 and @entity55 , not a single piece of @entity19 's plane was ever found			1
" i spend countless weeks imagining his fuselage possibly still intact , bouncing around in the ocean like a bottle thrown to sea waiting to be found , " @entity2 , now 39 , said quietly this week from the same @entity23 home where she grew up			1
" if there 's a chance he could still be alive somehow , he will find me here waiting , same address , same phone number as it was before and always will be , " she said with a mixture of hope and resignation			0
" if he survived , i was certain he was out there floating around like a cork surviving on the snack pretzels , chips and soft drinks that he always kept onboard for his passengers , " she reflected			0
enter into the narrative : 31 - year - old @entity1 , the executive director of @entity84 ( think it sink it reef it ) , a non-profit @entity34 - based marine conservation company in the business of protecting the habitat and building artificial reefs			1
about three weeks ago , @entity1 was preparing to visit reef sites off the @entity14 coast to take pictures for @entity84 's interactive reef map project used by researchers , tourists and maritime enthusiasts			1
@entity1 said his depth finder detected something on the sea floor and what looked like fish 80 feet below the surface			1
" we decided to check it out , out of curiosity , " he said			0
" you just never know			0
" he and another diver put on scuba gear and went down but did n't find any fish			2
that 's when they noticed a weed - shaped object like a coat hanger , a piece of stainless steel and other debris that @entity1 initially thought might have fallen off a barge			1
what they found were plane parts : two @entity125 piston engines , an engine block and a bent propeller , but no fuselage			1
lycoming engines were used on @entity130			0
they took photos and , once on shore , started looking for answers			0
hearing about the discovery , local fishermen led them to a second site about four miles away where there is a second plane , a larger , perhaps military - type aircraft with at least three tires			1
@entity1 went online to post dozens of photos and video of both sites and to ask the public for help in identifying the planes			1
were they remnants of @entity152 era planes or more recent aircraft ? see the photos and videos @entity1 and his team planned to dive this weekend to bring up what they could , but bad weather forced them to reschedule			1
his company , with its limited budget , is n't equipped to raise heavy pieces , but he said they may be able to use a float bag to drag some of the parts to shore			0
if they do n't work quickly , they worry a hurricane will come along and bury the site			0
@entity2 will be anxiously waiting			2
" anything for closure , " she said			0
she acknowledges she never stops looking , wondering			0
" i still check the horizon of the coastline here in @entity23 every day and the newspapers every night , " she said			0
just this week , she and her 9 - year - old son , @entity177 , were walking on the beach right after high tide in the moonlight to observe hundreds of turtles hatching			2
" we watched every single one with their cute little wiggly waddle all the way to the water where they just took off			0
no fear at all , " she said			0
around midnight , @entity2 and her son came upon something unusual partly covered in sand			2
could this be it , she thought , part of her father 's plane ? they started digging and eventually uncovered what appeared to be a gigantic rudder from a ship			2
" never a day goes by that i do n't think of him , " she said by phone the next day			0
" my @entity204 was the most amazing man			0
she hopes @entity1 finds the answer this time .			2

new : @entity208 *cancels* plans to dive this weekend *due* to bad weather
@entity2 has wondered for 16 years what became of her father
he disappeared over the ocean after sending a distress call from his small plane
diver @entity1 found sea - floor debris in an area where the plane might have fallen
