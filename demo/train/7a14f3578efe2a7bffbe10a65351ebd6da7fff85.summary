@entity0 -- inside an ordinary office building six blocks from the @entity5 , investigators sift through evidence of possible violations against ethics and laws committed by the nation 's elected representatives			1
this is the @entity13 , also known as the @entity13			2
it is one of the most important watchdogs in @entity0			0
that 's because the @entity13 is the only quasi-independent government body whose sole mandate is to formally investigate members of @entity22			1
but it could soon be silenced by the very people it investigates			0
" what is outrageous about it is that you see members of @entity22 on both sides saying they have zero tolerance for unethical conduct , " said @entity26 , a former federal prosecutor who now directs @entity27 ( @entity27 )			1
" but then behind closed doors they are quietly trying to kill the one body in @entity22 that is seriously going after unethical members			1
" @entity26 's public interest group monitors ethics and legal violations by members of @entity22			1
and , like many other citizen watchdog groups in @entity0 , @entity27 is worried that the @entity13 could soon die through purposeful inaction by @entity22			1
the ethics office -- which gets its mandate and funding from @entity22 -- must be reauthorized by this @entity22 , which soon adjourns , or early on by the new @entity22			1
what 's more , at least four of the @entity13 's board members are approaching the end of their terms , and new members must be selected and appointed for the organization to continue with its work			1
no investigations or reports or real work can be done by the office until their board is in place			0
the @entity13 was formed just four years ago when then - speaker of the house @entity60 and others declared they wanted to " drain the swamp " of scandals and corruption in @entity0			1
among the biggest scandals that prompted action was that of @entity68 , a former lobbyist , who admitted in 2006 to illegally showering gifts on officials in exchange for favors			0
the probe into those allegations led to convictions or guilty pleas for 20 lobbyists and public officials -- including a member of the @entity80 and several aides to congressmen			0
other scandals included those tied to former reps			0
@entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
since its creation in 2008 , the @entity13 has launched more than 100 investigations of lawmakers , raising serious questions about possible @entity22 misdeeds			1
in about a third of its investigations , the @entity13 found that @entity80 ethics , and sometimes federal laws , were likely violated			2
those 37 cases were referred to the @entity102 for further review			0
" the @entity13 has forced members of @entity22 to take ethics more seriously , " said @entity26			1
" it has forced the ( @entity80 ) @entity102 to act and has let all members of @entity22 know that they 're not going to be able to skate by like they have for so many years , with unethical conduct just going on			1
" @entity26 and her public interest group -- which is considered by some to be a liberal organization -- are n't the only ones worried about the future of the @entity13			2
@entity113 , chairman of the conservative @entity114 , agrees that some members of @entity22 publicly support the office and its efforts to crack down on ethics violations , but are privately trying to kill it			1
if the @entity13 is not reauthorized and new board members are not appointed , @entity113 said it would " ( send ) the message to the public that not only is the ethics system broken , but it does n't even exist anymore			1
" house speaker @entity126 and @entity127 @entity60 would need to lead the effort to reauthorize the @entity13 and to appoint new members			1
both @entity126 and @entity60 say they will do that			0
" @entity80 @entity132 are firmly committed to the continuation of the @entity13 and replacements will be named at the appropriate time , " said @entity60 's spokesman , @entity136			1
similarly , @entity126 " intends to retain the @entity13 for the 113th @entity22 and to appoint an ethics chair in a timely fashion , " his spokesman , @entity137 , said this month			1
but neither @entity126 nor @entity60 have made public any more specific actions they have taken			0
and time for action is quickly running out			0
the reauthorization should have really been started before this @entity22 goes on its winter break to allow for the time that it takes to select and appoint new board members			1
the new @entity22 is scheduled to be sworn on january 3			2
in many of its hard - hitting investigations , the @entity13 has confronted legislators about their actions , raising sensitive questions about possible conflicts of interest , financial reports , missing financial information , and even questions about the legality of some lawmakers ' actions			2
there are other watchdogs for ethics within the @entity22 -- the @entity102 , and the @entity161			2
but these internal committees are often criticized for doing almost nothing because they are in the awkward position of investigating their own members and close colleagues			0
by contrast , the @entity13 is an outside body , widely seen as being objective			2
it is made up of experts , including some former members of @entity22 , who are nominated and approved by @entity126 and @entity60			1
however , the @entity13 can not take disciplinary action against the lawmakers it finds are likely to have violated ethics or federal law -- so it has to refer its most serious investigations to the @entity102			2
out of the 37 cases it received from the @entity13 , the @entity102 meted out formal punishment only on two occasions			2
it is hard to know whether the stalled fiscal cliff negotiations have sidetracked any effort to reinstate the office , or if members of @entity22 might be quietly leading an effort to kill the @entity13			1
latest on fiscal cliff talks " nearly everything the @entity13 does rubs the entire @entity22 the wrong way , " @entity26 said			1
" and in large part that 's because @entity22 does n't want to hold anybody accountable for ethics violations			1
there 's no case that they think , ' oh this was a great case			0
we 're so glad the @entity13 brought it			2
' " in the past , numerous federal lawmakers from both political parties have voted to cut the @entity13 's budget or limit its powers , including reps			1
@entity208 , @entity209 - @entity210 ; @entity211 , @entity212 ; @entity213 , @entity214 ; @entity215 , @entity209 - @entity216 ; @entity217 , @entity209 - @entity216 ; @entity218 , @entity219 ; @entity220 , @entity221 ; @entity222 , @entity223 ; @entity224 , @entity225 ; and @entity226 , @entity212 - @entity227			0
none of them would agree to an interview with @entity1			0
the @entity13 also declined to answer any questions			2
the lawmakers who did speak to @entity1 about the @entity13 said part of the problem is that it casts a wide net			0
" they accept anonymous complaints made by anonymous individuals and then have the resources to conduct an investigation which can become a fishing expedition , " said rep. @entity236 , @entity237			0
rep. @entity243 , @entity209 - @entity210 said he believes there should be a way for the @entity247 public to raise issues about the conduct of their representatives in @entity0			0
but , he added , " some of what the @entity13 has sent to the @entity102 was actually really flimsy			1
i mean , conduct that if you have any idea what the real world is like , you would know was not ethically questionable or if it is , everything that happens in politics is ethically questionable			0
" and if the accusation is referred to the @entity102 , @entity243 said that 's " like torture " for lawmakers			0
" it 's like being charged with a crime , " he said			0
@entity236 raised a criticism that first surfaced several years ago after the @entity13 investigated rep. @entity266 and several other members of the @entity268 for expenses from an overseas trip to the @entity271			1
after those investigations , some representatives in @entity22 accused the @entity13 of " targeting " african - americans			1
" @entity276 was established for political reasons , " said @entity236 , who is african - american			0
" and the victims of it tend to be people who look like me and that 's why i 'm opposed to it			0
" i would rather for us to continue with the same ethics rule and process that was in place before we came to this @entity276			0
and i do n't think it 's working well			0
" all the citizen watchdog groups @entity1 interviewed -- including @entity27 , @entity289 , and the @entity114 -- said they do not believe the @entity13 has targeted any @entity22 officials because of their race or any other reason			1
they all maintain that the @entity13 has simply investigated cases where concerns of ethics were raised			2
whether members of @entity22 decide to keep the @entity13 or allow it to dissolve " is a critical test , " according to @entity298 , a widely respected former congressman who chaired the famous @entity299			1
" it is going to tell us whether the leaders of @entity22 are serious or whether they 're not serious about the enforcement of standards of conduct within the institution , " said @entity298 , who is now the director of the @entity300 at @entity301			0
he said it should surprise anyone that members of @entity22 do n't want to be held accountable for their actions			2
" i want to see a tough enforcement of those standards , " @entity298 said			0
" and it bothers me not a whit that some members of @entity22 get uneasy about it			2
they should get uneasy about it if they are acting in an unethical way			0
