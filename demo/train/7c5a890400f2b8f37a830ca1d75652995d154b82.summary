months after a troublesome @entity3 article detailed rape claims on campus , the @entity0 has reinstated its chapter of the @entity8 fraternity			1
the decision came after @entity12 police told @entity0 " that their investigation has not revealed any substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the @entity3 article occurred at @entity8 , " the university said in a statement			1
" we welcome @entity8 , and we look forward to working with all fraternities and sororities in enhancing and promoting a safe environment for all , " @entity0 president @entity19 said			1
in november , @entity3 published " a rape on campus " featuring a woman identified only as @entity27			1
in the article , @entity27 said she was brutally raped by seven men at the @entity8 fraternity house during a party her freshman year			1
the article sparked international outrage and put @entity0 in the spotlight on the issue of campus sexual assault			1
@entity0 shut down @entity39 social life on november 21 , two days after the article was published			1
but there were problems with the reporting			2
within days , critics began to question some of the story 's details , as well as @entity3 's decision not to contact the alleged attackers			1
the @entity49 , @entity1 and other news outlets followed up , identifying a number of contradictions and discrepancies			2
for example , two of @entity27 's friends told @entity1 that numerous details of the alleged attack described in @entity3 were entirely different from what @entity27 told them that night			1
and they said that , while it seemed clear that she had been traumatized , they saw no injuries consistent with an attack as vicious as the article describes			0
@entity3 apologized , acknowledging discrepancies and admitting that its writer had not contacted the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on @entity27			2
the magazine also said the writer did n't contact any of the men that @entity27 claimed participated in the attack , for fear that they would retaliate against her			0
" we published the article with the firm belief that it was accurate , " the magazine said			0
" given all of these reports , however , we have come to the conclusion that we were mistaken in honoring @entity27 's request to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account			0
" the fraternity 's chapter president , @entity85 , said there is still " an opportunity to move forward with important safety improvements			2
" " this has prompted us to take a closer look at ourselves and what role organizations like ours may play in this problem , " @entity85 said in a statement			0
" it 's opened all of our eyes to the problem of sexual assault			0
" last week , the university reinstated @entity39 social life and announced new rules fraternities must follow if they want to throw a party			0
among them : no pre-mixed drinks			0
and sober brothers at every event , guarding the stairs and with key access to each room			0
@entity1 's @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 contributed to this report .			0
