-- the @entity2 @entity1 needed a way to tell the world about its work			0
@entity6 wanted to continue the video storytelling he 'd begun on behalf of the poor in @entity9			0

" there are all these really big , sexy parts of @entity10 , but we need people to know about this [ project ] because it actually matters , " said @entity10 spokesman @entity27 , invoking pop star @entity28			1
" the nonprofits are n't that sexy -- but we 're trying to bring sexy back a little bit to the nonprofits			1
" the video volunteers page lets nonprofits post descriptions of projects for which they need videos produced			1
video artists , in turn , can scroll the offerings and pick a cause they 'd like to help			2
since october , the site has featured a particular issue each month			2
february 's issue is health			0
the best videos get featured on @entity10 's main page , giving massive exposure to both the charity and the video artist			1
" we would love to think users just do it out of the kindness of their own hearts , " said @entity57 , the nonprofits and activism manager at @entity10 , who said she thinks that 's usually the case			1
" but i think the incentive piece does help a lot			0
" on average , about 75 new volunteer videos appear on the page each month			1
during " animal welfare month " in october , 120 new videos were created , @entity70 said			2
last year , @entity6 , who had already visited @entity9 to video blog and raise funds for poverty relief there through his personal project , @entity78 , was looking for a way to address the issue closer to home			1
he found out about the @entity2 , @entity82 , food bank through @entity10 and the charity 's parent organization , @entity86			1
" it was just really serendipity , " said @entity6 , who lives in @entity87 , @entity88			0
" i wanted to do something charitable at home and @entity10 had made a relationship with @entity86			1

" the food bank is one of the nation 's largest and distributes about 1 million pounds of food a week			0

" it was really nice to have someone volunteer , and a cool way for [ @entity6 ] to get involved			0
it was a perfect blend of his passion , his skills and our need			0
" the resulting video shows @entity6 touring the bank 's distribution center on a forklift , interviewing clients and , ultimately , showing the 10,000 pounds of food he was able to provide with a $ 2,000 donation he 'd raised online			1
it appeared on @entity10 's main page on @entity125 , and had gotten more than 400,000 page views as of this week			1
the key to success on @entity10 , @entity6 said , is realizing that the site 's viewers are different than a television audience and that traditional public - service announcements are n't going to cut it			1
" when people watch videos on @entity10 , they do n't approach it the same way as when they watch @entity0 or ' heroes , ' " he said			1
" it 's very personal interaction for them			2
i just wanted to take a personal approach ... i thought if i do it this way , people would get more involved			0
" many of the clips are quirky , unconventional and self - referencing -- taking their cues from some of the most viral videos on the site			2
one video titled " @entity153 : make it suck less " promotes the launch of @entity14 while name - dropping some of the most viral web videos ever			2
" how about we put a squirrel on water skis and we tie a banner to its neck with all the stuff that you want to say about charity ? " says a guy having a video chat about the page			2
" or , we take a 7 - year - old kid to the dentist , we get him all hopped up on pain medications and then we have him talk about charity			0
" in the end , @entity70 said , the project is about giving charities -- which often struggle to make ends meet in tough economic times -- a chance to make their case to the masses			0
" if you 're a pet shelter in @entity185 , you do n't have the money , you do n't have the staff and , frankly , you do n't have @entity188 , " she said , referring to the @entity183 singer 's worldwide one campaign			0
