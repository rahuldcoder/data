-- @entity1 , @entity2 , and the @entity3 own about 250,000 foreclosed properties awaiting resale			1
hundreds of thousands of additional units will likely be taken over by the government and become available in the next few years			1
at least another 250,000 foreclosed properties are awaiting sale in the private market			1
this drag on the housing market is one of the reasons why housing prices continue to fall and new housing construction is stalled			1
all these properties could provide families with housing instead of sitting empty ( and , in some cases , looking the part )			1
to increase the use of idle government properties and recover some of the massive losses on mortgages , the @entity23 administration is looking mainly for proposals from firms or nonprofit organizations to buy and rent out the vacant properties			2
the @entity32 gets a gold star for this new strategy , but pursuing another approach at the same time — helping more families become homeowners — would take us further still toward ending the housing crisis			2
both approaches would reduce rents : as more renters buy vacant homes , demand for rentals will ease , and renting out vacant units will increase the supply of rental housing			1
both approaches are also likely to jack up demand for idle or underemployed construction workers , who 'd be needed to repair and renovate the properties			2
right now , millions of families are paying more in rent than the monthly carrying costs of owning a comparable property			0
in 2009 , 3 million families with children and annual household incomes below $ 30,000 were paying more than $ 800 per month in rent , according to the 2009 @entity61			0
if they can pay that much , they could certainly afford homes costing at least $ 115,000 — well above the value of homes at the 25th percentile of the price curve			0
with better access to financing , they could take advantage of bargain prices on foreclosed or other properties , and homeownership would immediately cut renters ' housing costs and lock in great rates			1
some past efforts at promoting homeownership failed when bad mortgages supported housing costs far higher than monthly rents on the expectation of home price appreciation			0
but that does n't mean we ca n't learn from past mistakes or take advantage of the current market context to make a major dent in family housing costs by using idle housing and human resources			0
as we spell out in our book , " moving @entity100 , " the government could create 1 million homeownership vouchers to cover the carrying costs of homes up to the 25th percentile of area home prices			1
given today 's low - home prices , such a plan would cost no more than about $ 3 billion per year and could be at least partially financed by phasing out the more costly and supply - oriented @entity103 , which offers a reduction in tax liability to property owners and private investors who develop low - income housing — and is a corporate honey pot that yields high profits and relatively few units for low - income families			0
a second approach would use turnkey programs			0
firms and nonprofit organizations would purchase homes , qualify the buyers through credit counseling and credit repair , ready buyers for homeownership , make modest renovations and repairs , and sell the properties			2
with this option , like the homeowner voucher , government could lay claim to a modest share of any capital gain ( say 15 % -20 % ) when the property is resold			0
among others , the @entity133 of @entity134 is already trying the turnkey approach			0
starting with unused housing from the @entity140 land bank , the company hired local construction workers and trained the unemployed to spiff up the units , helped renters correct and raise their credit scores enough to qualify for low interest mortgages and down payment assistance , helped them get financing , and walked the families through the sale			1
some renters took classes offered in financial literacy , too			0
on average , the renters reduced their monthly housing expenditures by a minimum of 25 % , including taxes and insurance			0
as the project scales up to involve scores of properties , it will create new jobs and training opportunities for underutilized construction workers			1
scaling up either homeownership initiative would be a move in the right direction , and either approach would help millions of middle income and near - poor families limit their housing costs			2
finally , targeting demand policies toward housing can cost - effectively reinvigorate the broader economic recovery because of the close links between construction , manufacturing , and other industries			0
just as important , by taking depressed units out of the housing market , the outlook for future housing prices will improve			1
this will reduce future foreclosures as more homeowners will make their payments rather than walking away from their mortgage commitments			0
it might even be enough to invigorate new housing construction			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 and @entity192 .			1

@entity191 , @entity192 : hundreds of thousands of foreclosed homes drag on housing market
they say government should help families buy these properties ; ease rental market
they say fixing up unused housing for homeownership would create construction jobs
*writers* : upping homeownership would help families , invigorate economy and provide jobs
