@entity0 , @entity1 -- whether entrenched in business meetings or stuck on a layover , you may find yourself in @entity0 with limited time to spare			2
but this vibrant city has so much to offer that it 's worth using every free moment to see something new			1
here are some of the things i managed slip in on a recent business trip to @entity0			2
underneath the " @entity17 " sculpture , the perspective gets distorted in the reflection			2
museum : the famous @entity20 ( 111 s. @entity21 ) has enough rooms of artwork to keep a person exploring for days ; unfortunately , i got there just before it closed at 5 p.m. still , it was worth a peek			1
in 15 minutes , you can see the impressive gallery of @entity30 , including @entity31 and @entity32 , and dash through to some of the nearby rooms to glimpse medieval religious art. @entity35 more time to explore , if your schedule allows ! for those who plan a little better , a number of works by painter @entity40 , famous for " @entity41 , " are on display until april 26			1
public art : hey , look , it 's a giant bean ! just a few blocks north of the @entity20 , this gigantic reflective sculpture called " @entity17 " weighs 110 tons , stands 33 feet high and is made of stainless steel plates			1
@entity49 artist @entity48 designed it with liquid mercury in mind , says the @entity54 web site			0
chances are , there 's probably a bunch of tourists taking pictures of themselves reflected in it			0
international food : @entity0 has a plethora of cuisines from around the world			0
for my first dinner , i went to the @entity66 ( 17 @entity67 ) , a @entity69 restaurant near @entity54 downtown			1
even if you 're alone , this is a fine place to sit at the bar , munching delicious wiener schnitzel and potatoes , and have casual conversations with the locals			0
the service is excellent , so if you 're in a rush , you 'll probably make your next appointment			0
bonus : take the famous @entity83 train back to your hotel ; there 's a stop right on @entity87			1
views : @entity89 has fallen , and so has the temperature , but the adventure is just beginning			1
for a breathtaking view of the surroundings , take the fast elevator up to the @entity95 at the 95th in the @entity96 ( 875 n. @entity21 ) and ponder the panoramic scenery over cocktails and snacks in the lounge on the 96th floor			1
the @entity0 area is so flat that you can see for miles : endless rows of streetlights extending into the horizon			1
a chocolate martini and a view like that go well together			0
music : if you 're still restless and eager for adventure , head to a different neighborhood			0
@entity115 , a trendy area north of downtown , has a slew of bars that cater to the young and the young at heart			1
@entity119 ( 420Â½ w. @entity120 ) will have either a live band or the standard selection of pop music			0
the local beer on tap , called 312 after the city 's area code , has a refreshing lemon - wheat taste			1
movies : ca n't sleep ? now that you 've seen some of the city , maybe you 'll recognize it in films			1
@entity0 locals seem extremely proud of the presence of their city in last summer 's @entity139 hit , " @entity140			2
" try watching it on mute so you can focus on the scenery rather than the shooting , and maybe that will help you doze off			0
pizza : do n't leave @entity0 without trying some of the famous deep - dish pizza			2
i was rushing to make my flight , but fortunately @entity150 's ( various locations throughout the city ) accepts take - out orders half an hour in advance , even in the morning			2
since there was a huge line for dinner the night before , in the morning i ended up ordering ahead and then eating half of it right there at the restaurant while my colleagues unhurriedly ordered at the table			0
before their food came , i ran to get a taxi to the airport with pizza box in hand			0
update : airport security did not question the cheesy goodness oozing in the box in my carry - on bag			0
the next day , the pizza took at least half an hour to reheat , but it was still pretty tasty .			0

paintings by @entity40 , famous for " @entity41 , " are at the @entity20
explore *nightlife* in @entity115 , a trendy area north of downtown
