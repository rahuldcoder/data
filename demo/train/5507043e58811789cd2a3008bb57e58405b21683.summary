@entity0 had never heard of the term " street harassment " until two years ago			1
before then , she simply considered the hisses and catcalls from strangers in the street an " annoying part of everyday life " that came with being a female			2
now , street harassment is the focus of an ongoing art project led by @entity0 that 's drawing global attention			1
this weekend , as part of @entity18 , people from the @entity15 to @entity16 plastered communities with portraits from @entity0 's " @entity22 " series			1
named for a self - portrait of @entity0 with the message " @entity22 , " the formidable portraits include sentiments meant to deter street harassment			1
one piece tells viewers , " you can keep your thoughts on my body to yourself " ; another reads " women do n't owe you anything			0
" @entity0 has spent the past year and a half traveling the country speaking to women and creating new posters based on their experiences of gender - based street harassment			1
her initial goal was to find out how women experience street harassment differently depending on where they live			1
women in car - dependent cities described getting calls from men in cars			0
in cities like @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , women reported men groping or leering at them on public transportation			0
what seems to be universal is the impact , @entity0 said			1
it leaves women feeling vulnerable and unsafe in their communities , as if their sole purpose in leaving the house each day is to entertain men			2
it makes women think twice about what they wear , the routes they take , even their body language			0
" the way that it affects women and things they go through have pretty much the same theme : women are out for consumption and for your enjoyment , " @entity0 told @entity79			1
" it creates a sexually hostile climate in our streets and communities			2
" since she started out papering the streets of @entity90 in 2012 , @entity0 has forged partnerships with community - based nonprofits and advocacy groups to create and share her work			1
she works with them to arrange talks with women and get permission from property owners to post her work on walls or in public spaces			0
she encouraged people who participated in friday 's global poster - pasting night to act within the bounds of the law			2
for @entity18 , @entity0 put up posters in @entity108 with members of the community			1
in a talk at @entity112 earlier in the week , she told a standing room only audience of men and women about the range of responses to the portraits			2
she receives mostly positive feedback from people in person ; the posters in public , however , bear the brunt of criticism			1
sometimes , people scribble derogatory words and phrases on her posters			1
other times , she has seen handwritten exchanges on the posters debating its message , like a real - world message board			0
that 's great , she says , because that 's what the project aims to do : inspire discussion and hopefully collaboration among the sexes			0
occasionally , a well - meaning man asks her in person about the idea of intention : what if he does n't intend to harass or make a women feel uncomfortable ? what if he just wants to compliment a woman in the hopes of getting her attention ? surely , that 's not harassment			0
@entity0 understands where he 's coming from , and she respects him for engaging her in discussion , she said			2
but what matters is how it makes the woman feel , she said			0
" that 's where all i can say is , ' i 'm sorry , i do n't agree with you , ' " she said , prompting laughter from the audience			0
" that 's where social norms and taking cues are important , " she said			0
" but the main goal is to make us rethink what 's considered normal and acceptable treatment of women			0
