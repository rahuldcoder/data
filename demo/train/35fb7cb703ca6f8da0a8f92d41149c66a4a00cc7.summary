is @entity3 the greatest ? " the world 's going to go ' wow ' if @entity1 gets beaten			2
that 's what everyone is looking to see			0
" if i beat @entity3 do you know what they are going to say ? ' you are supposed to beat him , you are @entity1 , you are the bigger man '			2
if i knock him out they 'll say ' you 're supposed to knock him out he 's been knocked out before '			0
" i 'm in a no - win situation and when i beat him no one is going to be surprised because he 's been beaten before ; whatever i do to @entity3 has been done before - he 's been beaten on three occasions			0
