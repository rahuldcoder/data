@entity0 , @entity1 -- perhaps no one better understands what the family of @entity6 rep. @entity5 is going through like the widow and children of @entity11 governor @entity10			1
" i mean , my heart is totally with the congresswoman , " says daughter @entity12			1
what do an @entity6 lawmaker from @entity16 and a @entity1 governor have in common ? both outspoken elected officials were gunned down in broad daylight , within days of each other			1
@entity10 died ; @entity5 clings to life			1
separated by half a world , they are united by similar crimes			2
@entity10 was assassinated by his own security guard last week in @entity0 , @entity1 's capital			1
he was coming out of a popular market when the guard , @entity28 , opened fire and shot him 27 times			2
governor 's accused killer makes unscheduled court appearance @entity10 had been an outspoken critic of @entity1 's blasphemy laws , which make it a crime to insult @entity36 or the @entity37			1
he argued that in a country that 's 98 % @entity40 , these laws are used to discriminate against minorites			1
that 's dangerous talk in a nation increasingly swayed by a more conservative brand of @entity36 , and several clerics targeted @entity10 as a blasphemer himself			1
@entity28 confessed in court monday that he killed @entity10 because of his support to change the blasphemy laws			1
and that , @entity10 's family says , is where his shooting diverges from @entity5 '			1
@entity12 says , " the difference is in @entity1 , this is not a message just to my father or my family			1
this is a message to all liberal and progressive people to keep quiet , and scare and intimidate them			1
" she says @entity5 ' shooting was an isolated incident , which has no chance of gaining popular support in the @entity6			1
" the impact is different			2
and the fear among the people			0
i 'm sure in @entity16 the general public is not feeling threatened , or not fearing that they can voice their views or openly condemn it			0
we are in a totally different situation			0
people who support us can lose their own lives			0
" shooting rampage suspect to make first court appearance another difference : even @entity5 ' political opponents publicly and forcefully condemned the man who shot her			1
the @entity81 speaker of the house @entity82 went on tv to say , " an attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve			0
" but in @entity1 , even @entity10 's supporters have been mostly silent : perhaps calling his loss a tragedy , but stopping short of criticizing the man who killed him			1
" it 's because they fear for their lives , " says @entity10 's son @entity93			1
" there 's also been a warning issued [ by clerics ] against anyone who has any further vigils , and anyone who takes up the case of the governor and his family , their offices will be burned and their person killed			1
" @entity93 says that was the real tragedy of his father 's shooting : it 's forcing liberals to stay quiet and hide			1
" i think they 'll be hunted			0
without a doubt in my mind i believe that			0
" @entity10 's shooter has been hailed as a hero by many conservative muslims in @entity1			1
he has been cheered , and showered with rose petals on his way into court			0
" that 's ... it makes me sick			2
it makes me sick to my stomach , " says @entity10 's youngest daughter @entity125			1
" some people genuinely believe this was ' the right thing ' to have been done			0
that 's the most scary and upsetting aspect of it			2
" @entity125 graduated from college in @entity135 , and now works as a journalist in @entity1			0
she reserves some of her strongest criticism for @entity1 's legal system			2
" there were over 200 lawyers who went and put garlands and rose petals around my father 's assassin 's neck			1
and these men are the so - called vanguards of justice			0
" @entity125 has little to no faith that the @entity151 where @entity28 is being tried will produce a fair result			0
" they have a sorry record of convictions			0
the investigation teams , they do n't hand in enough evidence			0
people are terrified of taking a stand			0
" now his family is looking back at the life of @entity10 , a businessman and governor of one of the most - populated provinces in the world			1
his widow @entity170 says , " when i started my marriage , he was arrested and put in a @entity173 fort for four months			0
it was a very difficult period , but we made it through that			0
and it 's kind of ended in such a dramatic way also			2
but on top of it all i say one thing : that he was a great father and even better husband			2
" the family says privately , they 've received thousands of messages , letters and visits to console them			0
@entity125 says a @entity192 woman approached her after the assassination			0
" she told me ' your father was all we had			2
' " they 're also looking ahead , to what legacy @entity10 leaves for the future			1
his daughter @entity125 says , " i hope his passing does n't mean that the room for debate is over			2
i believe there 's room in the public sphere for moderates , for liberals			1
i really hope that this does n't mean that debate in @entity1 is over			0
" his son @entity93 says he refuses to back down from the causes his father stood for			2
" it 's not a @entity10 trait			1
he believed in @entity1 too much to ever back down			0
in fact his last tweet was ' even if i 'm the last one standing , i 'd still support it			0
' " and daughter @entity12 says , " he had a liberal and progressive and secular vision			2
and he ... this country needed him			0
this country needed people like him			0
the region needed people like him			0
the world , i think , needs people like him			0
