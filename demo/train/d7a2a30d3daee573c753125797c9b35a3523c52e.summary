-- prehistoric children as young as three were encouraged by adults to make cave art 13,000 years ago , new research shows			1
the @entity7 study sheds new light on the lives of children and the ancient art they made during the prehistoric hunter gatherer period in the @entity14 caverns at @entity15 , known as the @entity16			1
while the caverns are famous for their striking drawings of woolly mammoths , bison and horses , the research focused on the thousands of lines made by people running their fingers along the soft clay walls throughout the five mile cavern complex			0
@entity7 archaeologists were able to identify the age and gender of the children who made the simple ancient art form known as " finger fluting " by measuring the width of the flutings and the profile of the middle three fingers			1
" we have found marks by children aged between three and seven years old -- and we have been able to identify four individual children by matching up their marks , " said @entity7 archaeologist @entity37			1
" the most prolific of the children who made flutings was aged around five -- and we are almost certain the child in question was a girl			2
" the fact that archaeologists did n't find a single place where fluting marks were made by adults alone suggests there were few boundaries between adult and child activities in this prehistoric hunter gatherer culture , according to @entity37			2
not only did the adults make art alongside the children , @entity37 says the fact that child - sized flutings were found on the ceilings of some cave chambers means adults actively encouraged them to make art , lifting them up to areas they could not reach alone			1
" some of the children 's flutings are high up on the walls and on the ceilings , so they must have been held up to make them or have been sitting on someone 's shoulders , " she said			2
the archaeologists believe one of the caverns is so dominated by children 's flutings that it may actually have been a " special place " set aside for them by the adults			0
" we sometimes think of one chamber as a playpen of sorts , since there are hundreds of children 's flutings but only a few made by adults , " said @entity37			1
why people made finger flutings , which also appear in caves in @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , is anyone 's guess			0
" we do n't know why people made them			0
we can make guesses like they were for initiation rituals , for training of some kind , or simply something to do on a rainy day , " said @entity37			0
the children were n't simply running their hands mindlessly along the cavern walls , however			0
research in 2006 revealed children had made hut - like shapes called tectiforms -- the first known instance of prehistoric children engaging in symbolic figure - making , according to @entity37			1
@entity37 says her research shines a light on an aspect of history that is typically ignored in academia			0
" it 's important to realize that children played a major role in the development of not only art , but what it means to be human , " she said .			0
