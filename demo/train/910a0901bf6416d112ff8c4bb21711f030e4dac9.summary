@entity1 , @entity0 -- famed for her opulent theatrical style in films like " @entity6 " and " @entity7 ! , " production designer @entity8 is probably the last person you might expect to find in the remote @entity10 of @entity11 knocking up a film set			1
@entity8 created costumes for " @entity11 " with trademark wit and whimsy			1
but this is exactly where the two - time oscar - winner ended up in her role as co-producer of her husband @entity20 's latest film , " @entity11 , " which stars @entity22 and @entity23			1
" i am certainly not a girlie girl , " says @entity24 who worked in the role of production and costume designer on the film , which is the first identifiably @entity28 epic ever made			1
but she admits that she was grateful for help with the " mammoth " task of the film 's logistics which she describes as an " eye - opener			1
" " @entity11 " was filmed in various locations across the huge country -- @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 where @entity24 and her team constructed a huge exterior set to look like 1930s - era @entity45 , and finally the remote @entity46 of @entity11			1
this is where they set about building " @entity50 , " the sprawling cattle ranch in the middle of an inhospitable wilderness			0
in the film it belongs to @entity57 's husband and saving it from a takeover plot becomes the focus of the feisty aristocrat 's epic journey across @entity11 with rough hewn cattleman , @entity64 ( @entity23 )			1
" we brought everything up there , " says @entity24 of the film 's main set which was situated in @entity67 , an isolated location in an area famed for its natural beauty			1
it was so remote that the team had to build roads , and when @entity24 explains 36 huge trucks were needed to transport all the equipment and raw materials required to build " @entity50 " from scratch on the site , the scale of the production becomes clear			2
" logistically , ' @entity11 ' was a mammoth task , " says @entity24 , " moving those number of people , and we had to build roads to get equipment in and ship things weeks in advance so they 'd actually get there			1
" in the flesh she is a petite and blonde with a wide - eyed enthusiasm that causes her to stress - every - syllable when she talks			2
she 's hugely garrulous , hugely engaging and is , in fact , wearing a very girlie jacket			0
but it 's also clear she 's made of pretty steely stuff , which she needed to contend with some of the problems that beset the production			0
there were , as she puts it , some " pretty crazy times			0
" like when it started raining in @entity46 during the " dry , " an apparently rare occurrence that , even more unusually , carried on for a number of days			0
@entity24 was in @entity111 anxiously awaiting news from her team			2
" i got sent a photo of " @entity50 " and it was just an open field , the house was under water			0
" i just said to myself ' do n't panic			0
' anyway , three days in a row i got [ the same ] photos and i thought , ' i 'm going to have to come clean , we 're never going to be able to shoot in two weeks because everything will have gone moldy , the turf will be dead , the trees will be dead			0
' " @entity24 decided to move the production back to @entity111 where they would concentrate on stunt work with the horses , only to find out that an outbreak of equine flu had struck the @entity111 area			1
" i remember being in a car and hearing it on the radio at the very , very moment we 'd decided to got back to @entity111			0
" it meant we could n't move the horses from the @entity138			0
and then we had the entire horse team running around trying to find doubles for our horses in @entity111			0
" despite the pressures , @entity24 was still able to find the time to do what she does best -- create costumes with trademark wit and whimsy			2
she concentrated particularly on @entity22 's costumes which @entity20 felt were so central to the film 's narrative that he wrote them into the script			1
in one of @entity57 's most sartorially absurd moments , she wears a safari - style outfit complete with pith helmet , gauze netting and wire spectacles for the three - day journey from @entity45 to " @entity50 " with @entity64 ( @entity23 )			2
to come up with the costume , @entity24 went to town , researching every possible picture she could find of women in safari suits in the 1930s -- from @entity168 in a @entity170 movie to a woman in @entity172 in 1932			2
" it really gave me the key to the character , that @entity20 had her in her mind thinking this was completely appropriate			2
" she was still on @entity179 in her head , that she was totally a fish out of water , that she had no concept of where she was coming to or the nature of the place , not one iota , she was costuming herself for the the experience and i loved that idea and that really helped me in thinking about the other costumes			0
" @entity24 is sometimes considered to be the creative brains behind her 16 - year partnership with @entity194 which began with camp classic " @entity6 " in 1992 , but this is something she vigorously denies : " the reality is @entity20 sought me out when he first started working professionally and he has always been focused on the visual aspect			1
" but , she says , " i do think it is serendipitous that somehow we really do spark off each other			0

two - time oscar - winner @entity8 co-produced epic film " @entity11 "
her husband and collaborator of 16 years , @entity20 directed the film
the film 's logistical *challenges* included *bad* *weather* , equine flu and sheer scale
@entity24 still found the time to design star @entity22 's whimsical costumes
