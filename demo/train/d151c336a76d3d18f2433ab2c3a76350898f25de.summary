@entity0 -- as @entity5 began its workweek monday morning , the trains ran exactly on time , the elevators in thousands of @entity0 high - rises efficiently moved between floors , and the lights turned on across cities with nary a glitch			1
what makes this monday so remarkable is that for the first time in four decades , none of the energy is derived from a nuclear reactor			1
over the weekend , @entity5 's last remaining nuclear reactor shut down for regular maintenance			1
in the wake of the @entity20 , reactors have not been allowed back on			2
@entity5 is now the first major economy to see the modern era without nuclear power			1
@entity25 's reactor 3 in @entity26 shut down saturday evening in a much - watched move by government , industry and environmentalists , who are waged in a public battle over the future of @entity5 's energy policy			1
" i think it is not easy , but this challenge is worth fighting for , " said @entity5 's @entity34			2
" there is an increased chance of earthquakes in @entity5 , so that has a significant risk to the @entity43 people and the @entity43 economy			0
the only way forward is to rapidly shift the energy source from nuclear to other sources of energy			0
" that 's not the call just from environmental activists , but from a public suspicious of nuclear energy and its regulatory bodies since a tsunami and earthquake triggered nuclear meltdowns at three reactors at the @entity20 nuclear plant in march 2011			1
thousands marched through the streets of @entity0 on saturday , celebrating the shutdown of the final reactor			1
the protesters waved colorful , traditional " koinobori " carp - shaped banners for @entity66 that became a symbol of the anti-nuclear movement			0
that movement grew from the grass - roots level in the wake of the disaster as the country watched tens of thousands of residents living within a 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) radius of the nuclear plant evacuated and the remaining area turn into a contaminated wasteland			0
before the @entity20 disaster , @entity5 relied on nuclear for about 30 % of its energy			1
as reactors have come off - line , the country has increased its imports of fossil fuels			0
@entity5 's government predicts it wo n't be able to keep up that pace , and the void will result in an energy crunch this summer , possibly leading to rolling blackouts			1
the national government 's ruling party , the @entity92 , has been urging local communities to allow reactors to return to operation			0
the party 's deputy policy chief , @entity96 , bluntly said without nuclear energy the world 's third - largest economy would suffer			1
" we must think ahead to the impact on @entity5 's economy and people 's lives , if all nuclear reactors are stopped			1
@entity5 could , in some sense , be committing mass suicide , " @entity96 said			0
@entity109 , chairman of @entity5 's biggest business lobby , @entity111 , joined the plea in an april press conference			2
" we can not possibly agree to do the kind of energy saving yet again this year , or every year from now on , " he said , referring to the country 's efforts to turn off air conditioners and shift operation of production lines to weekends			2
" the government must bring the nuclear power stations back into operation			0
" economist @entity125 , managing director at @entity126 , said @entity5 could avoid the economic fallout by defining a clear energy policy , something it has failed to do so far			2
" the issue to the private sector of @entity5 is the government is taking its time in a very emotional , highly politicized debate			2
and the end result is very , very slow or no decision - making at all			0
after all , if you do n't have an energy policy , you do n't really have an economic policy because everything revolves around the energy , " he said			0
@entity43 prime minister @entity142 has promised a clear energy policy sometime this year , perhaps by summer			2
at a conference last month , the chairman of the @entity145 said the nuclear industry was committed to rebuilding the municipalities around the @entity20 plant , decommissioning that facility and pushing for increased safety measures at plants nationwide			2
" we , the nuclear industry , will learn what should be learned from the accident at the @entity157			0
based on that , we will endeavor to restore the image and position of nuclear energy , " @entity158 said			1
nuclear energy must remain part of the government 's policy , he said , " in order for @entity5 to continue sustainable growth as a nation committed to trade based on science and technology			1
" but @entity171 , who used to live in @entity20 , said she wo n't accept any policy that includes nuclear energy			1
" nobody believes the government anymore when it says nuclear plants are safe , " she said			0
" @entity5 is an earthquake country			0
it is already dangerous to have nuclear plants here			0
if we have another accident , we wo n't have anywhere to live in @entity5 anymore			0

@entity5 closes its last operating nuclear reactor over the weekend
final shutdown follows a *swing* against nuclear energy after last year 's @entity20 meltdowns
thousands march through @entity0 on saturday to celebrate the final closure
government has warned that summer energy demand may prompt rolling blackouts
