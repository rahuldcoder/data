@entity0 , @entity1 -- will i get over the end of saturday deliveries by the @entity6 ? i 'm sure i will			1
but like countless others in this country , i will miss them			2
living in rural @entity1 , in a fairly isolated farmhouse overlooking the @entity11 , i look forward to the mail , which brings news from relatives and friends , @entity17 cards , bills , and -- most of all -- saturday visits from @entity19 , who has been arriving at my house for years now , always with good cheer , local gossip and a sense that @entity24 's in his heaven and all 's well with the world			1
i remember as a child looking forward to the arrival of mr. @entity29 , as my sister and i called him , on saturday mornings			2
he was a dour fellow , but we liked him			0
we had no school on saturdays , so all the children got to know him on that day			0
he was missing a front tooth , so it was probably a good thing that he rarely smiled			0
when he did , it was an occasion			0
i loved him , mostly because he brought regular letters from my pen pal in @entity42 -- letters with an array of strange , colorful stamps and peculiar tales from abroad			1
it was an adjustment when , years later , we had to get used to @entity29 , a young woman with masses of blond hair and red lipstick			0
the mail has always kept me in touch with the world			2
as a young man i lived in @entity55 for seven years , and loved getting two postal deliveries a day , bringing letters on blue aerograms from home			1
i would open those fragile blue letters very carefully , so as not to lose words			2
they were often scribbled in a tiny hand so the author could get as many words as possible within the aerogram 's limited boundaries			0
opinion : goodbye , postal service ? my @entity55 postman 's name was @entity72 , and he told me about his grandfather , who had brought three or four deliveries to every house each day			2
the mail was like e-mail in those days			2
if you lived in a city , such as @entity80 , you could really send a letter in the morning and expect it to make it across town by the afternoon			2
nowadays it can take several days to get a letter from one side of @entity1 to another			1
sometimes i wonder if we 're still using the @entity89			1
as a boy , i read a book about the @entity89 , and had fantasies about joining it			1
the express started up in the mid- 19th century , with relays of postal workers on horseback who would carry letters from @entity99 over the @entity100 , through the @entity101 , to @entity102 -- and it only took about 10 days			2
it was the invention of the telegraph that brought this wondrous service to a halt , not unlike the advent of the @entity108 , which has made the postal service much less relevant to our lives			0
e-mails deliver most of our joys and sorrows today , and we conduct routine business in this ephemeral form			0
handwritten letters have become precious artifacts			0
for future biographers , the loss of real letters presents a dilemma			0
my bookshelf holds volumes of the collected letters of my favorite writers , and i treasure those by @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and others			1
will anyone ever publish someone 's collected e-mails ? how @entity135 could save the @entity6 so much of our thinking is about loss , and this is one of the losses we must bear			1
i doubt that we 'll ever return to obsessive letter - writing , and do n't expect to get many letters from abroad , with brilliantly colored stamps bearing the visage of unknown kings , queens and other eminent people i 've never heard of			1
i wonder if i 'll even know the person who brings letters to my house in the years to come			0
at least my part of @entity1 has internet access			1
in the immediate future , the absence of saturday postal deliveries for rural areas that lack access might have genuine consequences , hurting business and dampening the spirits for people who already feel a bit out of touch			1
everyone would like , i think , to see a robust postal service -- the @entity167 represents the nation at home			0
i still make special trips into town , a drive of several miles , to do " business " at the @entity167 , where i meet friends to exchange gossip , buy special editions of stamps and , for nostalgic reasons , purchase aerograms to send to friends abroad			1
the bustling atmosphere is cheery , especially at @entity17 , when people wait in line to get their odd - shaped boxes weighed and posted			0
@entity6 finances show smaller loss , but still in trouble the postal service will always be part of our lives , and long may it live			0
i 'm sorry about the loss of saturdays , which may make me feel a little more isolated on weekends at my hilltop house			0
but who ever thought the government existed to make us happy ? the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

@entity199 lives in small - town @entity1 , and says he will miss saturday mail deliveries
@entity199 : we are losing the joy of saving , *re-reading* letters from pen - pals , family and friends
@entity211 replaced the @entity89 , he says , just as e-mails have replaced mail
@entity199 treasures his letters of favorite writers : who will publish collections of e-mails ?
