a @entity1 student who says she was raped in front of onlookers at a " wildly out of control " campus fraternity party has filed a lawsuit against @entity6 of @entity7 , 11 of its members and the alleged assailant , according to court documents			1
@entity12 , then a freshman , said she was raped by another student last may at the @entity15 of @entity7 fraternity house in @entity17 , @entity18 , at a pledge " strip show , " says the suit , which was filed tuesday in a @entity18 federal court			1
@entity23 does not usually identify victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because the woman wanted to make her name public			1
" i 'm proceeding in this case with my real name instead of ' @entity33 ' because as the victim of a heinous violent crime i 've done nothing wrong and have nothing to be ashamed of , " @entity12 said in a statement provided by her lawyer			1
" i ca n't even describe the pain of being raped , or how much it alters a life , and no other person should ever be forced to have that experience			2
i hope my experience and lawsuit will create changes that protect others			0
" at the party , the lawsuit says , many " underage and extremely intoxicated " young people danced with naked pledges and " spilled alcohol throughout the area			2
" @entity12 , who has taken a leave from her studies , said she became extremely uncomfortable , put on her jacket and attempted to leave when a male student picked her up from behind and raped her in the presence of " numerous others , " according to the lawsuit			1
@entity1 public safety officers then took her to a nearby hospital , where a diagnosis of sexual assault was documented , the lawsuit says			1
" @entity62 takes all reports of risk management violations , especially those with regard to sexual assault , very seriously , " @entity61 , executive director of @entity62 , said on the fraternity 's website			1
" we are currently investigating the incident and gathering further information			0
" after an internal investigation , the university expelled the alleged perpetrator and imposed " sanctions against the fraternity and members , " according to a statement by @entity1 president @entity77			1

@entity17 police confirmed that they responded to a sexual assault complaint from the @entity88 on may 4 , 2013 , spokeswoman lt. @entity85 said			1
the investigation is ongoing , and no charges have been filed , she said			2
@entity91 said police were having difficulty finding witnesses and urged anyone who attended the party from may 3 into may 4 and may have witnessed anything to call police			1
the lawsuit says the fraternity contractually demands self - governance from @entity1 , relinquishing the public safety and housing services the university generally provides to students			2
the fraternity allegedly failed to adequately provide its own security , and the defendants failed to train themselves in safety and risk management issues , including sexual abuse prevention , hazing and the misuse of alcohol , according to the lawsuit			1
@entity12 's lawyer , @entity113 , said that because the fraternity sets itself apart from the university , officers from the university 's @entity115 can enter the fraternity only in " exigent circumstances " or when specifically asked to come in			1
" this lawsuit seeks to hold this fraternity responsible for its gross mismanagement which it does under the guise of self - management , " @entity113 told @entity23			0
" @entity62 self - management has historically proven itself to be flawed and dangerous			0
women have been raped because of this mismanagement			0
people have died because of this mismanagement			0
and this victim will hold the fraternity responsible for its tradition of dangerous mismanagement			1
" @entity1 would not comment on the fraternity 's arrangement with the @entity115 , but @entity77 's statement acknowledged that the university 's fraternities have " some autonomy			1
" " all have seen increased scrutiny over the past few years , " @entity77 said of fraternities			0
" we intend to focus our attention on improving the safety of these spaces			0
" @entity1 was not named in the lawsuit			0
" on behalf of the university community , i want to express our horror at this shameful assault , " @entity77 said in the statement			0
" sexual violence will never be tolerated on our campus			2
sexual violence on college campuses is a national problem , and it 's important to raise awareness about this issue			2
at @entity1 we are committed to caring for survivors , vigorously pursuing perpetrators , and creating a positive campus climate in which sexual violence and misconduct have no place			2
" @entity165 has taken a leave of absence from the university since the attack and is receiving " intensive counseling , trying to pull her life together , " her lawyer said			0
@entity165 is seeking $ 10 million in damages , the lawsuit says			0
in 2012 , a @entity1 student sued the university and another fraternity , which @entity1 no longer recognizes as a student organization , after she said she was raped in its frat house two years before			1
