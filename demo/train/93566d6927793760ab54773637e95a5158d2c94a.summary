-- fire lt. @entity1 had just finished another call at @entity3 when the call came crackling over his radio			1
" still in his turnout gear , @entity1 looked out the terminal window , and what he saw gave him a start			1
" all you could see across the airfield was dark smoke rising into the sky , " he said			1
it was just moments after @entity17 had clipped the seawall on the bayside airport 's runway , tumbling to a violent stop saturday			1
@entity1 was among a small army of fire and police responders who would race to what many referred to in a monday news conference as a surreal scene they had never expected to see			1
among them was police officer @entity31 , who was on a routine welfare check at an aircraft terminal when he heard the call			1
he raced outside to see the tower of smoke rising , hailed a nearby ambulance and told its driver to follow him			1
and at the fire department 's airport station , sardonically nicknamed the " @entity43 , " lt. @entity40 ' adrenaline began to flow as soon as she heard the tower dispatcher 's call			2
" i knew from her voice that the event we were going to was real , " he said			0
she and her driver hopped into the cab of @entity52 and began racing toward the scene			0
as they approached the crash site , they saw a large column of smoke , fire coming from one of the stricken plane 's engines and jet fuel streaming from the wing			1
passengers were milling around outside the airplane , some of them even heading back to retrieve luggage			0
as @entity71 and fellow officers worked to herd passengers away from the burning , leaking plane , @entity1 dashed up the escape chute to search for stragglers			2
@entity40 was n't far behind			0
" i said , ' if he can do it , i can do it ' , " she said			0
while @entity1 headed for the cockpit , @entity40 and another firefighter probed the inside of the dark , smoky and eerily quiet interior of the broken @entity84 , looking for passengers to rescue , knocking down flames as they went			1
as they approached the rear of the plane , they found wounded passengers , some of them stuck			2
about this same time , @entity92 clawed his way up into the airplane through the broken tail section to help firefighters , drawing praise from rescue workers for braving the danger with no protective gear			1
@entity92 's boss , @entity101 , followed @entity92 aboard the airplane to see him tossing seats and luggage to make room to help passengers get off the plane			2
" so much chaos going on , and it was quiet , " he said			2
" everybody was doing what they were trained to do , save lives			0
" the amazing memories may end up being marred by one incident			0
assistant fire chief @entity115 said it 's possible that one of the fire department 's vehicles that responded to the crash may have " contacted " one of the teenage girls who died in the crash			0
authorities found the two girls on the tarmac , but it 's not clear if the they died in the crash , or later , or even if a fire vehicle hit one of them			0
" at this time because we have not clearly defined and established those facts , we can not answer your questions , " @entity115 said monday			0
the incident is under investigation , he said .			0
