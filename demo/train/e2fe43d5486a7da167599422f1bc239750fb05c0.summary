the peaceful 1989 uprising began with a student march to mark a 1939 clampdown on opposition in what was then @entity17 - occupied @entity16			1
it drew 15,000 people -- students as well as teachers , professors and ordinary @entity1 who had grown weary of state control			1
@entity24 , one of the students who took part , said the march " was very different " from previous demonstrations he had joined			1
" there was a different group of people , " he said			2
" we feel that people that participated in such events before had come , and they 're ready to do something			1
and it was more and more visible every minute			2
" the protest was held a week after the opening of the @entity39 , as pressure was building on the @entity10 governments of @entity42			2
when the demonstrators tried to divert the march to central @entity0 's @entity46 , they were attacked by police -- a response that led tens of thousands more people to join mass demonstrations that lasted another 10 days			1
" my kids can not understand today what was moving our minds and hearts that day 20 years ago , " @entity24 's wife , @entity51 , said tuesday			2

the @entity67 ceded power in december , and @entity66 became president			0
" many of our citizens who took part in the democratic changes died already with a feeling that they contributed to something that meant a lot , " @entity66 said tuesday			0

" the anniversary march was capped by a concert that featured dissident musicians of the day , along with @entity84 folk singer @entity83			1
@entity66 himself appeared onstage with a guitar , but told the crowd , " do n't worry , the guitar does n't mean i 'm going to play today			0
" musicians , actors and other artists played major roles in the protests			0
@entity94 , now the @entity1 government 's human rights minister , was a rock singer who became the revolutionaries ' key negotiator			1
" in the beginning there was many times this idea , ' what am i doing here , ' " @entity94 told @entity2 recently			0
" i knew in the future i 'd get used to it			0
and five or 10 days later , i forgot i was a musician and i submerged myself in political negotiations			0
" the celebration was organized by @entity110 , a nonprofit group established to observe the milestone anniversary of the dismantling of the @entity114			1
" our inspiration to do this was from our memories -- we still remember the times that preceded the events , " said @entity115 , one of the organizers			2
