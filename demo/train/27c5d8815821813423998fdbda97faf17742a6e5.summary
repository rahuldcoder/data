-- well ... you ca n't say " @entity4 's " cast and producers did n't try			1
the third season of @entity7 's comedy returned significantly lower in the ratings			0
in its new ( and much tougher ) time period , " @entity4 " delivered 4.8 million viewers and a 1.8 adults 18 - 49 rating tuesday night			1
this is a series low for the show ( the @entity17 's " @entity16 " also had some particularly bad news , below )			2
it 's arguably unfair to compare " @entity4 " to its own 3.4 premiere last year ( from which it 's down 47 percent )			1
the show debuted in the fall on wednesday nights with a lead - in from top - rated " @entity27			1
" whereas last night 's time slot in a few short months has been haunted by the short - lived " @entity29 " ( which premiered to a 2.4 rating ) and " @entity31 " ( 2.0 )			1
" @entity4 's " 1.8 rating is about average for this slot , but that 's not great considering the two shows that mainly generated that number were cancelled			2
it 's lead - in , " @entity41 , " had 7.6 million viewers and a 2.0 rating			1
the numbers follow the show 's cast and creator @entity45 traveling the country and guerrilla marketing the hell out of " @entity4 " for the past month			1
yesterday , @entity45 told us that he figured the show would return lower , but had hopes for the upcoming weeks			2
" here 's what i really think will happen : i think the show will not premiere as high as people hope , " @entity45 predicted to @entity0			0
" and what i hope will happen is what always happened on " scrubs " when they brought it back			0
the first week , the numbers are always lower than their predecessor ...			0
but what would happen then , as people became educated that the show was back on , each week it would be higher			0
the next week , the gap would be closed			0
" also it should be noted that @entity68 is pretty lousy for shows in general			2
overall tv usage was down 7.3 percent last night , according to @entity72			1
meanwhile @entity7 's " @entity74 " ( 5.0 million , 1.7 ) is getting washed out , falling 29 percent its second week			2
at 10 p.m. " @entity75 " ( 6.2 million , 1.2 ) was soft			0
no @entity76 for @entity77 : with only a repeat of " @entity79 " for a lead - in , " @entity16 " ( 1.1 million , 0.3 ) fell a stunning 40 percent from last week to a series low ( and down 50 percent from its midseason return two weeks ago )			1
a 0.3 rating is like " remodeled " and " @entity85 " territory for the @entity17			0
also tuesday : @entity86 won the night with " ncis " ( 3.9 ) , " ncis : @entity88 " ( 3.2 ) and " unforgettable " ( 2.3 ) -- all down between 3 - 7 percent			1
. @entity89 was second with " @entity90 " ( 2.8 ) down 15 percent , " @entity91 " ( 3.2 ) down 9 percent and a steady " @entity92 " ( 2.1 )			0
@entity93 was third with " @entity94 " ( 2.0 ) down 13 percent to a season low and " parenthood " ( 1.6 )			0
