@entity0 -- the abortion issue is far from settled			1
it 's just as contentious today as it has ever been in the @entity4			1
wednesday 's 41st anniversary of the landmark @entity9 case , @entity5 , which upheld legalized abortion before about 24 weeks , ignited the polarized , emotional battle			1
what 's happening ? in sum , the @entity15 tweeted , thousands gathered , politicians pontificated			1
anti-abortion activists have a bigger megaphone as it has come to remember the day they say the unborn lost their rights			0
thousands of anti-abortion activists convened on the @entity23 in the annual " @entity27 " rally that drew buses of activists			1
this year they braved the snow that fell tuesday and below freezing temperatures that followed			0
pope @entity31 showed his solidarity , tweeting " i join the @entity27 in @entity0 with my prayers			1
may @entity34 help us respect all life , especially the most vulnerable			0
" politicians sent releases , including sen. @entity39			0
" every human life is a precious gift from @entity34 , and our law should protect innocent human life , " the @entity41 @entity40 said			0
what 's changed ? in the abortion debate , each side tries to out maneuver the other			1
but the game is becoming more intense , complicated and consuming			0
opinion : why progressives should be pro-life both sides are working at the local , state and federal level to pass laws			1
obviously the anti-choice advocates want laws that restrict access to abortion while pro-choice proponents are working for measures that increase access to abortion care and options			1
both sides are focusing on the court system , too , working to place judges that have a tremendous amount of clout in shutting down or allowing abortion - related laws			1
who 's winning ? the answer is not so cut and dry , but last year was a big year for anti-choice advocates			0
even the president of one of the largest women 's rights groups admitted that the anti-choice side made some inroads			0
" things are in a crisis , " @entity81 , president of @entity82 , said			0
" the number of bills that have moved in the state legislature are definitely concerning			1
" according to the group , 24 states adopted 53 anti-choice measures in 2013 , including one in @entity91 that outlaws abortion as early as six weeks of gestation			1
effectively outlawing abortion as many women do n't know they are pregnant at six weeks			1
on the flip side , 10 states have adopted only 16 pro-choice measures , mostly involving access to care and contraception			0
what 's @entity102 doing about it ? not much			0
but efforts are in motion			0
after @entity40 gained the majority in the @entity109 in 2010 , they have been working to roll back access to abortion			2
@entity40 lawmakers launched a comprehensive attack on @entity114 , women 's health clinics that provide abortion services , working to cut their federal funding			1
the @entity117 , also known as @entity117 , caused major debates over abortion as opponents said it allows federal funding to be used for abortion services or providers who offer them			1
supporters disagree as @entity126 agreed to tighten language			0
the @entity109 passed the " @entity128 " that restricts abortions at 20 weeks , citing evidence that fetus feel pain at that time			0
but the measure is stalled in the @entity134 and president @entity135 has vowed to veto it should it reach his desk			0
@entity135 to visit @entity31 in march does politics have anything to do with it ? everything			0
while it wo n't make a campaign , it can surely break it			0
the @entity144 , which is holding its annual conference this week , put its events on hold and encouraged members to attend the " @entity27 " rally			2
abortion is a key topic of this year 's meeting as a coalition of @entity144 members are introducing a resolution that encourages @entity40 candidates to " support @entity40 pro-life candidates who fight back against @entity126 deceptive ' war on women ' rhetoric by pointing out the extreme positions on abortion held by @entity126 opponents			1
" first on @entity1 : @entity40 urges candidates to stand ground on abortion it spurred @entity41 gubernatorial candidate @entity167 ' campaign			2
the issue launched her to political notoriety after she mounted a filibuster in the @entity41 legislature opposing restrictive abortion measures			1
but since she launched her candidacy , she 's had to talk about a lot more than the abortion			2
@entity126 are willing to highlight the issue when it frames @entity40 positions on abortion as extreme			1
" last year , the @entity40 said they needed to reach out to women , but instead they 've decided their plan is to spend more time fighting to restrict the rights of women to make their own health care choices , " @entity179 chairman @entity178 said in a statement			0
rarely do candidates run on the issue and win			2
but the issue can doom candidates who make controversial remarks			2
in 2012 , @entity134 hopeful @entity189 's campaign took a nose dive after the @entity40 , who opposes abortion in all circumstances , made incendiary remarks			2
@entity126 have worked to optimize @entity40 stances on abortion			2
they say the @entity40 have launched a " war on women " and pounded the issue in campaign ads and stump speeches			2
do people care ? yes and no. while it 's a topic that evokes strong opinions , it 's unlikely that people will pick a candidate solely on the issue			2
according to a may @entity1 poll , 25 % of people thought abortion should be legal in all circumstances compared to 20 % thought it should be legal in no situation			0
a @entity214 released last week found that respondents thought abortion was one of the least important issues that the government address			1
it came in 17 out of 19 topics			0
what 's next ? the @entity9 is hearing three cases involving the issue , including @entity226 v. @entity224 , which challenges the buffer zone law in @entity229 that creates a safe space around reproductive health care facilities			1
and there 's also the @entity234 case , which will be heard this spring			0
the chain store has asked the court to exempt it from providing contraception and " abortion - inducing drug " health coverage to their workers , which is required under the @entity117			1
and lawmakers will continue the battle around the country .			0

this week is the 41st anniversary of the landmark @entity5 @entity9 decision
the abortion issue is just as contentious as it was in 1973
the @entity15 tweeted his sentiments as thousands of pro-life marchers rallied in @entity0
