-- a rampant @entity1 thrashed arch rivals @entity2 4 - 1 in @entity3 to reach the quarterfinals of the @entity5			1
@entity6 and @entity7 took advantage of sloppy defending to give @entity1 a 2 - 0 lead before @entity10 headed in for @entity2			1
@entity11 was denied an equalizing goal for @entity2 when the officials failed to spot that the ball had clearly crossed the line			0
but despite @entity2 coach @entity17 's claim that the controversy was the turning point , a far superior @entity1 ran away with the match in the second half , with @entity22 scoring twice on the break to inflict @entity2 's biggest ever @entity25 defeat			1
" i think we played well but then i was disappointed by the mistakes and they counter-attacked well , " @entity17 told @entity26			0
blog : it 's time for goal - line technology " @entity1 is a big team and they played well -- we made mistakes , but the referee made a bigger one			0
" it was the first @entity25 meeting between two of football 's oldest foes since 1990 , when @entity1 beat @entity2 on penalties after a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity2 's only previous victory had come in the 1966 final -- a 4 - 2 triumph at @entity49 's @entity48			1
@entity1 carved the game 's first opening inside five minutes when a pass over @entity2 's defense found @entity54 , whose shot was saved by the legs of @entity57			1
the same direct approach brought the opening goal after 20 minutes when a long punt downfield from @entity61 sent @entity63 racing clear			0
the striker showed strength to hold off @entity10 and flick the ball past @entity57 with an outstretched right foot to post his 50th international goal and his 12th at @entity25 finals			0
@entity2 's defenders were caught out of position again for @entity1 's second goal as @entity22 shifted the ball to @entity7 , who slashed a left - footed shot into the far corner			1
five minutes later , @entity2 got back in the game when @entity78 's cross was headed home by @entity10			0
then came the controversial moment when @entity11 's strike from the edge of the penalty area struck the underside of the bar and bounced down about two feet over the goal - line , only for @entity88 referee @entity87 and his assistants to fail to award a goal			0
@entity1 may feel the decision atones for 1966 , when @entity2 were famously awarded a third goal even though @entity94 's shot appeared to bounce down on the line			2
@entity2 looked the stronger side in early stages of the second half and @entity11 rattled the bar with a free - kick			0
but then the @entity102 onslaught began as @entity2 's hopes were buried by two fine counter-attacking goals in three minutes			2
@entity105 teed up @entity22 to smash the third past @entity106 at his near post , and then @entity54 crossed for the @entity109 winger to compound @entity2 's misery			2
@entity1 , who have now reached at least the quarterfinals at every @entity25 since 1954 , will face @entity113 in the last eight on saturday .			2

@entity1 crush arch rivals @entity2 4 - 1 to reach @entity25 quarterfinals
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity22 ( 2 ) score for @entity1
the result is @entity2 's heaviest ever defeat at a @entity25
@entity1 will meet @entity124 's @entity113 in last eight in @entity126
