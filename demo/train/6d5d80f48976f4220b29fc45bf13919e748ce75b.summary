-- february 15 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			0
@entity14 : this is for you , @entity17 ! @entity18 , @entity19 : got ta say thanks to the students at @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 for that			1
as a former drummer , i can tell you were right on rhythm ! i 'm @entity30			0
today 's commercial - free subjects include economics , social studies and health			1
let 's go ahead and get started			1
@entity36 @entity37 : first up , economics , as president @entity39 presents his ideas for the federal government 's 2012 budget			1
you or your family have to make budgets , looking at how much money you earn versus how much you spend			0
the government does the same thing , but with a lot more zeroes			0
in fact , this budget request from the president , which is just for 2012 , is for $ 3.7 trillion ; more money than most of us can even imagine			1
the goal of a budget is to make sure you do n't spend more than you make			1
but that 's exactly what the @entity60 government is doing right now , which is why we have what 's called a deficit			1
president @entity39 says his new budget will cut that deficit by $ 1 trillion over the next 10 years by making some pretty big cuts to a lot of government programs , and by making more money from increasing some taxes			1
but there are critics on both sides			0
some @entity75 argue that the president 's proposed cuts wo n't do nearly enough , and some @entity78 say that president @entity39 wants to cut too much			1
another important thing to keep in mind			0
what the president released is a budget request			1
he does n't actually decide on what the budget is			2
that 's the job of @entity86 , and it can choose to accept , reject or modify the president 's plan			1
protests in @entity4 @entity37 : going global now , with headlines of political protests in two different countries			0
@entity36 , @entity4 , where tens of thousands of people marched through the capital yesterday			0
they were speaking out against the @entity4 government			0
security forces were out on the streets too			0
at times , they allowed the protesters to march , but there were also reports of fighting between police and protesters			0
this @entity108 video shows tear gas being used to break up a protest			0
it 's hard for @entity0 to verify some of the reports coming from @entity4 because the country makes it hard for journalists to cover these kinds of protests			2
and the @entity4 government slowed down the internet in what seems like an attempt to limit how much information gets out			0
@entity122 @entity37 : the other country we 're looking at where people are calling for change in their government is @entity5			0
this is a north @entity130 nation that 's home to nearly 35 million people			2
as you can see from these pictures , protesters and security forces faced off against each other this past weekend			0
yesterday , @entity5 officials said they 're going to lift a " state of emergency " that @entity5 has been under since 1992			0
some experts say that decision might be an attempt for @entity5 to avoid uprisings like we 've seen recently in @entity146 and in @entity147			0
@entity148 @entity149 , @entity19 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm an organic compound that works as a stimulant			0
i affect the body 's nervous system , as well as the heart and kidneys			2
i have a bitter taste , but no odor			0
i 'm caffeine , and having too much of me can make you anxious or irritable			2
energy drink warning @entity37 : it 's the caffeine , plus the other stimulants in energy drinks , that can give young people health problems			1
this is according to new medical research on the risks of energy drinks			1
caffeine , as you know , is a legal stimulant			2
it 's just that large amounts of it can be dangerous			2
one study found that almost half of all caffeine overdoses back in 2007 happened in people younger than 19			1
so what are the risks ? well , caffeine -- too much of it -- can mess up your sleep patterns			2
it can increase your blood pressure , which can put a strain on your heart			0
and if you 're on any medications , caffeine can interfere with them and cause additional problems			2
symptoms of too much caffeine : nausea , dizziness , rapid heart rate and seizure			2
i wan na be clear we 're not talking about sports drinks , like @entity204 or @entity205			2
those can actually be good for you , helping hydrate you after a big game			0
you can distinguish energy drinks by their ingredients			1
energy drinks might include caffeine , taurine and guarana , additional stimulants that can hit different people in different ways			1
responding to this report , the @entity219 says a lot of drinks you can get have caffeine in them , and that " young adults getting coffee from popular coffeehouses are getting twice as much caffeine as they would from a similar size energy drink			1
" @entity232 ' recovery @entity37 : @entity60 representative @entity233 is talking to her brother - in - law			0
might not sound like a major news story , but it is a huge step for @entity232 , whom you see here			2
she was shot in the head last month during an attack in @entity240			0
family members and officials say she is making incredible progress in her recovery			0
part of that is her conversations with her brother - in - law @entity248 , an astronaut currently on board the international space station			0
@entity232 ' husband , @entity251 , is also an astronaut			0
he 's scheduled to go into space in april			2
@entity253 @entity254 , @entity19 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity257 's humanities class at @entity258 in @entity259 , @entity260 ! what country has the world 's fastest growing economy ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity268 , b ) @entity7 , c ) the @entity60 or @entity269 ) @entity270 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity268 has the world 's fastest growing economy			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! the new # 2 economy @entity37 : it 's because of that growth that @entity268 has made a move in terms of the world 's largest economies			1
@entity268 is now the second largest , behind only the @entity60 what does that mean for the former number two , @entity7 ? we 're checking in with @entity286 , who explains how a move in the economic rankings means a change in power			1
( begin video ) @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity6 : step into @entity295 electronics store and you can hear the shift of economic might in @entity299			2
sales signs are in @entity268			1
workers assist shoppers in @entity304			0
what 's odd : we 're in downtown @entity6			2
but the people with the purchasing power here are not the @entity7			1
you do n't have to tell this electronics store about the economic power shift in @entity299			2
it 's something they 've seen for quite some time			2
when it comes to the number of paying customers , they see about 200 @entity7 a day			1
compare that with the number of @entity268 : 1,000 customers every single day			1
@entity323 @entity322 , @entity324 : i 'm proud of @entity268 ! @entity326 : ... says @entity327 , a @entity268 immigrant who 's risen with the fortunes of his home country			1
he works for @entity330 as a translator but plans to become a doctor			0
today , he 's helping out this @entity268 tour group here in @entity6 to spend money			1
@entity336 , @entity337 [ @entity338 ] : " @entity7 was once like @entity268 , " says @entity295 's store manager , referring to @entity7 's economic surge in the 1980s			1
" it 's @entity268 's turn now			1
" @entity326 : @entity268 has blazed ahead , expanding its manufacturing sector and domestic infrastructure			1
at this pace , @entity7 's government estimates @entity268 will overtake the @entity60 economy in just 15 years			1
@entity7 , meanwhile , has been stuck in two decades of stagnation and deflation amid indecisive economic policymaking			1
it now faces a demographic tsunami : the world 's fastest aging population , one of the lowest birthrates , and a debt - to - gdp ratio that 's highest among developed nations			2
that may be a snapshot of economic might , but economists warn it 's not so black and white			1
@entity363 , sr. strategist , @entity364 : @entity7 's demographic tsunami , as it was termed , is very real and is going to stunt growth in that country for years to come			1
they need to get that situation under control			0
but @entity268 also has a demographic tsunami of its own , to re-use that term , coming as well			1
@entity373 [ @entity338 ] : " i know we became the world 's number two economy , " says this @entity268 shopper			1
" but we still have very poor people and there 's a gap between rich and poor			2
i hope @entity268 as a whole becomes a wealthy country like @entity7			1
" @entity383 , @entity384 [ @entity338 ] : " i envy @entity268 's hungry spirit , " says @entity386 , who says what 's missing most in @entity7 is passion and drive			1
" but i believe @entity7 still has potential			1
it 'll come back again			0

she just hops on a treadmill , cranks it up to two - and - a - half miles per hour , and she 's on her way			0
the terrier and her 86 - year - old workout partner hit the gym twice a day			0
it 's nice that they exercise together			0
but if this gym rat wants to put on some serious muscle and all she does is walk on the treadmill ... goodbye @entity37 : ... i do n't think she 's going to get anywhere			0
