-- @entity1 is about to get a little extra sparkle in those famous neon lights			1
it was recently announced the " @entity6 " musical is officially happening			1
before you book your tickets to @entity9 ( or , conversely , get the heck out of @entity11 ) you should know it 's not expected to have a very long run			1
" twilight : the musical " will make its off - @entity1 debut as a one - night - only staged reading on january 16 , and the proceeds will benefit the charity @entity17			1
the most exciting thing about this announcement may be the cast , and the plot teases their characters ' names give us			0
in addition to @entity28 and @entity29 , ( who already sings a lullabyâ € ” why should n't he also belt out a @entity1 tune ? ) the name that gets me onboard is the totally awesome @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , who played @entity36 opposite @entity38 ' @entity37 in the spectacular " @entity39			1
" other teases that make me cautiously optimistic this could be a lot of fun : characters named both @entity37 and @entity45 will be showing up -- perhaps leading up to that epic vampire vs. wizard war that we all know is coming			2
according to the website the show , " examines our culture of obsession through the story of teenage outsider @entity28 who risks everything when she embarks on a star - crossed romance with @entity57			2
" the musical , which you can watch blurry clips of on @entity62 , originally premiered and was workshopped last year in @entity9			1
with opening lyrics like " nothing ever happens in @entity65 " and ( of course ) " i wish i had a boyfriend , " the show seems to be in the same vein as " @entity39 " in that it 's a fun - loving parody by people who clearly enjoyed the source material			2
it will be interesting to see how far the production is able to get , as the show has no stated affiliation with @entity78 or @entity79			0
parodies are typically ok , copyright law-wise , but a show has to play up the ' unofficial ' and ' spoof ' aspects -- the fact that the character names do n't appear to be changed surprises me			0
that this one - night - only reading is for charity ( aka no one involved is making money ) probably helps			1
@entity0 reached out to @entity93 ( one of the producers ) and they did not return requests for comment			0
love it , hate it , or some strange combination of both , i 'm surprised a " @entity6 " show has n't happened sooner			0
think of the musical possibilities for a show with the tagline ' death never sounded so good			2
' ( please resist the obvious joke in the comments )			0
a teenage girl is in love with a guy vampire from the wrong side of the tracks living			0
are vampires and werewolves really that different from @entity118 and @entity119 ? and try to tell me the werewolf chases in the woods are n't just waiting to be a shirtless staged ballet			0
if you were in @entity9 would you check it out ? what scenes from the films are begging for a musical interpretation ? see the full article at @entity0			1
