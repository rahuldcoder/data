two veterans in a @entity2 psychiatric facility languished for years without proper treatment , according to a scathing letter and report sent monday to the @entity6 by the @entity8 @entity7 , or @entity7			1
in one case , a veteran with a service - connected psychiatric condition was in the facility for eight years before he received a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation ; in another case , a veteran only had one psychiatric note in his medical chart in seven years as an inpatient at the @entity21 , @entity22 , facility			0
examples such as those are the core of the report released monday by the @entity7 , an independent government agency that protects whistleblowers			2
read the @entity29 agency said it is still investigating more than 50 whistleblower disclosures involving patient health or safety allegations at the va nationwide , and " these cases represent more than a quarter of all matters referred by @entity7 for investigation government - wide , " according to the report			1
@entity38 kept the @entity33 scandal a secret the report also slams the @entity33 's medical review agency , the @entity43 , or @entity44 , for its refusal to admit that lapses in care have affected veterans ' health			1
for example , when the office reviewed the @entity21 psychiatric cases , it confirmed the patient neglect yet " denied that ... ( it ) had any impact on patient care			0
" " the @entity33 , and particularly the @entity33 's @entity43 ( @entity44 ) , has consistently used a ' harmless error ' defense , where the @entity59 acknowledges problems but claims patient care is unaffected , " the @entity7 said			1
" this approach hides the severity of systemic and longstanding problems			1
" in response to the @entity7 's letter , @entity64 , the @entity33 's acting director , issued a statement : " i respect and welcome the letter and the insights from the @entity7			1
i am deeply disappointed not only in the substantiation of allegations raised by whistleblowers , but also in the failures within @entity33 to take whistleblower complaints seriously			2
" @entity64 said he has directed a " comprehensive review of all aspects of the @entity78 's operation , to be completed within 14 days			0
" as part of its review , the @entity7 looked at whistleblower allegations at 10 @entity33 hospitals , where it found the @entity33 's review of cases " appears to contradict its own findings			1
" according to the @entity7 , at a @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity88 , the @entity89 substantiated a number of allegations , including " improper credentialing of providers , inadequate review of radiology images , unlawful prescriptions for narcotics , noncompliant pharmacy equipment used to compound chemotherapy drugs , and unsterile medical equipment			1
" " in addition , a persistent patient - care concern involved chronic staffing shortages , " which led to the creation of " ghost clinics " in which veterans were scheduled for appointments without an assigned provider and as a consequence were leaving the facility without receiving treatment			0
despite the numerous lapses in care at the @entity33 , the @entity89 did not acknowledge any impact on the health and safety of veterans , according to the @entity7 letter			1
monday 's letter also outlined whistleblower complaints ranging from unsterlized surgical equipment in @entity122 , @entity123 , to neglect of elderly residents at a geriatric facility in @entity127 , @entity128 , to a pulmonologist in @entity130 , @entity131 , who " copied prior provider notes in over 1,200 patient records , likely resulting in inaccurate health information being recorded			0
" other facilities with substantiated complaints include @entity137 , @entity138 ; @entity139 , @entity140 ; @entity141 , @entity142 ; and @entity143 , @entity144			0
the @entity7 said all these cases are " part of a troubling pattern of deficient patient care at @entity33 facilities nationwide , and the continued resistance by the @entity33 , and the @entity44 in most cases , to recognize and address the impact of health and safety of veterans			1
" the agency also expressed concern that the @entity33 has n't adequately addressed whistleblower complaints of wrongdoing			2
referring to the scandal of a secret wait list at the @entity163 facility , the @entity7 found that " the recent revelations in @entity163 are the latest and most serious in the years - long pattern of disclosures from @entity33 whistleblowers and their struggle to overcome a culture of non-responsiveness			2
too frequently , the @entity33 has failed to use information from whistleblowers to identify and address systemic concerns that impact patient care			2
" at a facility in @entity175 , @entity138 , the @entity89 substantiated allegations made by a @entity33 employee , including a shortage of providers that led schedulers to cancel veterans ' appointments			2
it found that 3,000 veterans were unable to reschedule appointments and that staff was instructed to alter wait times			0
in may , @entity187 interviewed @entity188 , who worked as a scheduler at the @entity86 in @entity175			0
" we were sat down by our supervisor ... and he showed us exactly how to schedule so it looked like it was within that 14 - day period , " @entity190 told @entity187			0
" they would keep track of schedulers who were complying and getting 100 percent of that 14 day ( s ) and those of us who were not			0
" despite its findings in @entity175 , the @entity43 wrote that it " could not substantiate that the failure to properly train staff resulted in danger to public health and safety			0
" in monday 's letter , the @entity7 disagreed with that determination , saying the @entity33 's conclusion in this case " is not only unsupportable on its own , but is also inconsistent by other @entity33 components examining similar patient - care issues			1
" since november 2013 , @entity187 has been investigating and publishing reports of wait lists and deaths of veterans across @entity33 hospitals across the country			1
in april , details of the secret wait list in @entity163 , and allegations of 40 veterans dying there while waiting for care , emerged when retired @entity163 physician dr. @entity226 stepped forward ; dr. @entity226 first appeared on @entity187 with details of what happened in @entity163			0
@entity230 had chances over the years , but action on @entity33 not enough performance reviews at troubled @entity33 showed no bad senior managers			0
