@entity1 everyone is on a mission to make up for lost time			2
at @entity8 's home in @entity1 , the @entity6 journalist tries to get closer to his baby @entity9 , born while he was in prison			1
" a few days ago i managed to make him smile , " @entity8 told @entity2			1
" that 's great progress			2
i missed six months of his life and i ca n't get those back			2
" his two other kids , @entity17 , 5 , and @entity18 , 4 , wo n't leave his side			0
for the 411 days he spent behind bars , they were told their father was at work			0
" i told them every time they came to visit that i 'm at work , i 'm staying at work			0
they were still too young to live and to know about prison			2
" @entity8 now spends most of his time at home , tiptoeing away when he occasionally leaves so his children do n't cry			1
and throughout the day he checks on @entity34 , his fur - heavy caucasian shepherd dog , that was shot by police who arrested @entity8 in december 2013			1
@entity8 was arrested with colleagues @entity40 and @entity42			1
they were brought to trial with 17 others on charges of belonging to a terrorist organization -- the @entity48 -- threatening @entity50 's national security and airing false news , among others			1
@entity53 were tried in absentia			0
not all were journalists , nor had a clear connection to @entity6			1
the @entity57 found them guilty in june 2014			0
@entity40 and @entity42 were sentenced to seven years in prison			1
@entity8 was sentenced to 10 , receiving an extra three years for charges of possession of ammunition , a bullet he collected from the field while reporting in @entity64			1
@entity8 broke down when he was taken from court that day			1
" i was terrified for my wife , because my wife was pregnant at that time			0
and i felt sorry for my children , because if i spent 10 years in prison , then i will go out of prison and then they will be 10 years older			1
and i will miss all that time			0
" on january 1 , the @entity72 , which represents the final stage of criminal appeals , sent the case for retrial , explaining in documents released to the official news agency that the original verdict failed to provide reasoning for the conviction			2
the court said there was insufficient evidence for charges of belonging to an illegal organization -- a reference to the @entity48 -- how the defendants joined the group , or their knowledge of its objectives which allegedly included terrorism			1
evidence and details for other charges such as possessing unlicensed broadcast equipment and receiving support from the @entity48 were also lacking , the court said			1
it criticized the @entity101 's handling of testimonies , search and arrest warrants , as well as confessions that defense lawyers claimed were made under duress			0
a month later , @entity42 became the first man to benefit from a new law issued last november allowing the president to deport foreigners held in @entity50			1
he arrived in his @entity113 home city of @entity114 days later			0
@entity40 , an @entity50 - @entity115 citizen , gave up his @entity50 nationality in the hope of benefiting from the same law			1
he remained behind bars , though , and was only granted bail -- along with @entity8 -- on february 12			1
he told the court that day that he gave up his nationality reluctantly , and only after several high - ranking officials convinced him to do so			0
they told him " nationality is not a piece of paper but it is in the heart			0
you can visit @entity50 as a tourist and apply for citizenship again at the state council			1
" a new judge released all defendants pending a retrial			2
@entity40 was singled out to pay 250,000 @entity50 pounds ( roughly $ 33,000 ) bail , because as a foreigner he had no official residence in @entity50			1
being a foreigner brought difficulties			0
his plans to get married to his fiancee @entity143 were complicated by the fact that instead of seeking a cleric to officiate at the wedding , the couple now has to go through a bureaucratic process involving the foreign and justice ministries			0
but the couple said that despite the trauma of @entity40 's imprisonment , the experience brought them closer			0
" @entity143 is my hero			0
she was getting me all the news in prison and she was engaging with the lawyers and the media			2
she was basically my voice outside , " @entity40 said			0
sitting next to him , @entity143 said prison made him see life in a new light			2
" he became a stronger person			0
" along with @entity8 , @entity40 spent the first few weeks of his detention in the maximum - security scorpion prison in solitary confinement			1
a combination of sleeping on the floor and not getting the medical attention he needed at the time exacerbated a shoulder injury , limiting his arm 's mobility			0
this is among many things that keep him angry			0
" i 'm furious , i get tantrums at night			0
i used to get these tantrums in the cell , " he said			0
" the campaign and the support across that globe is great , but that 's not what 's going to get me out of prison			2
what is going to get me out of prison is a combination of a good lawyer , diplomatic engagement on the highest levels from @entity115 and @entity6 senior management			1
" capitalizing on a months - long , worldwide campaign -- # @entity197 " -- by @entity6 , another campaign is urging the @entity115 prime minister to push for @entity40 's extradition from @entity50			1
meanwhile , @entity40 has been more vocal in his criticism of his employer , accusing @entity6 management of negligence			1
one of many ongoing disagreements between the two sides is the legal representation			0
from the onset , @entity40 refused to work with @entity6 lawyers because he did n't think they were experienced enough			1
he hired a different attorney , whom , he claimed , @entity6 refused to pay			1
@entity6 said it paid for his lawyer and his bail and has learned the lessons from the first trial , by hiring the lawyers that won the retrial at the @entity72			1
" we did everything possible to secure his release and to avoid it happening in the first place			0
every aspect of our response to the extreme incitement we 've faced in @entity50 since 2013 can be scrutinized in hindsight , and we 've said in the past that lessons have been learned , " the network said in a statement to @entity2			1
the trial continues amid a backdrop of ongoing tension between @entity50 and @entity231 -- the small @entity233 country that finances @entity6 -- and increasing restrictions on freedoms in @entity50			1
a @entity1 court had banned one of @entity6 's @entity239 channels in 2013 citing a threat to national security			2
the channel was believed to be a threat to @entity50 by supporting the outlawed @entity48			1
the network contested another verdict in 2014 that banned @entity246 from using the @entity50 satellite @entity247			2
it eventually shut down the controversial channel in december 2014 during short - lived improvement in @entity50 - @entity231 relations			2
in addition to accusations of politicization , the trial is also emblematic of the general environment in @entity50 , where thousands have been imprisoned in a crackdown on dissent			2
rights groups accuse the judiciary of rubberstamping police and prosecution charges rather than providing fair trials , resulting in mass sentences			0
@entity267 , the judge that issued the first conviction against @entity6 journalists , has recently sentenced 183 people to death and 230 to life in prison in two other separate trials			1
" they arrested us , not only me , i think to intimidate other journalists , to scare other journalists , " said @entity8 , adding that the lack of evidence in court and disputes over legal representation are irrelevant in a case that is principally about press freedom			1
@entity8 says it is a battle he is willing to sacrifice everything for , emboldened by the solidarity of colleagues			2
quoting an exchange of messages between him and jailed @entity50 photojournalist @entity293 , he said : " when there is one journalist behind bars , all journalists all over the world stand together just to free him			1
it 's not about news organizations or networks , no. it 's about us , it 's about freedom of speech			0
this is what we stand for			0
" @entity293 has been held without charge since august 2013			0
at least eight other journalists remain behind bars , according to the @entity309			2
on march 8 , all defendants will return to court for the next hearing of their retrial			0
in the meantime , they enjoy the " mundane things in life , " which for @entity40 means having dinner with his fiancee , or talking with his mother with " no police cop watching you 24 hours a day			0
" @entity8 is enjoying being behind the wheel of his car -- and simply being outside			2
" i saw the colors of the skies and this blue and purple and red			0
this color and this view made me feel this is freedom			0
it was the first time to see the sunrise in 411 days			0
