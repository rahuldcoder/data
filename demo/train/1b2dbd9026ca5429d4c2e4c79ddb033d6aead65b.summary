-- @entity2 lights and tinsel ? that 's so last @entity5			1
christmas trees do n't have to be traditional to look spectacular			0
in fact , some of the most memorable ones this year are anything but			0
how about a christmas tree made from @entity11 ? or macaroons ? even the odder entrants in this selection of the world 's most amazing @entity5 trees on public display tend to be big and bright			1
and there are still plenty of sparkly stars to be found and photographed			0
they 're just much bigger and much brighter than the ones on the tree in your living room			0
@entity26 ( @entity27 ) the well - preserved old town in the @entity27 capital looks like just the sort of place that needs a christmas tree			2
now it 's got one -- and it 's 25 meters tall			2
it 's not so much a tree as a metal skeleton covered with fir tree branches			2
@entity27 fir tree branches , though -- they 're not made in @entity42			1
@entity43 , @entity44 , @entity26 , @entity27 2			0
@entity45 ( @entity46 ) @entity48 's tallest christmas tree is in @entity46 , but even more striking than its height is that it 's made from @entity11			1
the nine - meter tree at @entity46 is made from 400,000 blocks of the child 's toy			1
more than 300 @entity11 baubles , including candles and slightly kinky multicolored chains , have been snapped on			0
it 's not a tree , either ? c'mon -- where 's your @entity5 spirit ? @entity46 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity46 ; +607 597 8888 3			1
@entity66 ( @entity67 ) the unveiling of this 23 - meter @entity70 spruce was a star - studded affair -- @entity72 , @entity73 and the @entity74 performed			1
weighing 12 tons , the tree is decorated with 45,000 leds and topped with a 3 - meter - wide @entity78 crystal star			1
the tree was donated to the @entity66 by the @entity81 family , who planted it in the gardens of their @entity85 home 20 years ago			1
and eventually wanted to get rid of it			0

@entity90 christmas tree ( @entity91 ) at 20 - meters tall , the world 's highest in - store christmas tree is an intricate , horology - themed affair standing in @entity96 's chicest department store , @entity90			1
celebrating its 30th birthday this year , @entity99 watchmaker @entity97 helped design the tree , including the toy village at its base that springs to life on the hour			0

floating christmas tree ( @entity112 ) @entity112 advertizes its superlative seasonal contribution as " the world 's largest floating christmas tree			2
" turns out it may be the world 's only notable floating christmas tree , save those dumped in various water supplies when the celebrations are over			1
nonetheless , its stats are pretty impressive			0
more than 100,000 people turned out to see the 85 - meter , 540 - ton behemoth lit up for the first time in the waters off @entity112			0

@entity131 ( @entity132 ) last year , the @entity133 were criticized for decorating their home with an apparently excessive 54 @entity5 trees			1
this year , they have only 24			0
@entity136 was tasked with switching on the 10 - meter @entity138 blue spruce known as the @entity131 , which stands outside the @entity140 gates in president 's @entity141			2
the tree is a permanent fixture , looked after by the @entity145 -- which keeps that itchy foliage from getting everywhere when it comes time to trash most trees , @entity149			1

@entity151 ( @entity152 ) since the fall of the @entity154 , @entity70 has given the @entity156 capital a @entity5 tree every year as a sign of peace and solidarity with the reunified country			1
the decorations on this year 's tree , located as always beneath the @entity151 , are a bit of a contrast			2
they 're a freebie from @entity168 , @entity156 's largest crude oil and natural gas producer			0

macaroon christmas tree , @entity176 ( @entity177 , @entity178 ) the christmas tree at the @entity180 in @entity177 , @entity178 , is edible : it 's made from 8,000 colorful macaroons			1
using 10,008 egg whites , 110 cups of sugar and 57 cups of almonds , the hotel 's pastry team took 58 hours to create -- or should that be bake -- the tree			1

umbrella tree , @entity190 ( @entity191 ) luxury umbrella brand @entity192 made the tree outside @entity191 's @entity190 , so it 's not hard to guess which popular winter accessory features heavily			1
mirrored baubles designed to represent raindrops are interspersed with miniature umbrellas set with sequined crystals			0
one of the brand 's trademark birdcage - style umbrellas -- supposedly a favorite of the @entity206 royal family -- replaces the traditional star at the top of the tree			1
good thing @entity210 does n't make a @entity5 tree -- they do n't right ? the @entity190 , @entity213 , @entity191 ; +44 7396 9000 10			1
@entity214 , @entity215 ( @entity216 , @entity96 ) decorated with elaborate opera costumes , yards of lace and hundreds of crystals , the christmas tree at the @entity216 is the fruit of a collaboration with @entity223			0
the hotel and the opera house share a baroque style , as does the tree -- which sings in a nice soprano			2

@entity231 christmas tree , @entity232 ( @entity233 ) a creation of the @entity236 fashion house @entity231 , the @entity45 at @entity233 's @entity232 is unsurprisingly hung all over with the brand 's plexiglass " bag bug " handbags			1
the tree at nearby @entity242 ( the fashion house 's headquarters ) has a similar theme , but with miniature @entity231 baguette bags being used instead			2
ca n't help imagining that 's one itchy tree			2

recycled bottle @entity45 ( @entity191 ) @entity251 in origin but still impressive , the @entity45 outside @entity250 in @entity191 was crafted from 900 plastic bottles collected by local school children			0
made by artist @entity256 , the tree has a serious message : that more waste is produced over the festive season than at any other time of year			2
possibly including these bottles when everyone 's done with the tree			0

never mind the baubles -- one of these @entity5 trees is made of macaroons
another , in @entity233 , is *festooned* with luxury handbags
some go for glitz -- like the crystal - star - topped @entity66 tree in @entity67
