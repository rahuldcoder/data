@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's something you do n't see every day : a @entity6 governor speaking at an inner city church , trying to end the stigma associated with drug addiction			1
" we have to acknowledge the disease and treat their illness , " @entity1 gov. @entity10 told a crowd gathered here for a forum he organized			1
" we would never stigmatize someone who has cancer			2
yet , we feel free to stigmatize someone who may have tried - made one bad decision - and because of their makeup , they become an addict			2
" for @entity10 , working with former drug addicts could be helpful if he decides to run for president in 2016			1
the image could humanize a governor who is better known for his tough talking , finger wagging style -- especially after his administration was engulfed by the scandal surrounding the closing of the @entity34			2
but @entity10 said he is n't doing anything different			1
" it 's always been there , " @entity10 said of his compassionate side			1
" the fact is that 's the stuff that gets the most publicity because it 's the most entertaining on tv , and i get that			2
" " you need to be compassionate and you need to listen , and i have the ability to do that too , " @entity10 insists			1
just do n't call him a compassionate conservative , a term first coined by @entity50 during his first presidential bid			2
" listen , the term has already been used by a previous president , " @entity10 tells us			1
" i think this is just me being myself			2
i care about people no matter what stage of life they 're at , no matter what circumstance they 're confronted with , " he says , quickly adding that " when it 's required to get in someone 's face and tell them off , i 'll do that too			2
" luckily , he laughingly assured this reporter that was n't " required " -- at that moment			2
@entity10 held his forum on drug addiction at the church where @entity73 grew up and learned to perform			1
in 2012 , the church hosted her funeral after @entity76 lost her battle with drugs			0
" the reason we 're here is because of @entity73 in a respect because i came here for the funeral , invited here by her mom			0
that 's where i met pastor @entity89 , who was my partner today and the pastor of this church for the past 22 years , and we 've been talking about this issue a lot since then , " says @entity10			1
when @entity73 died , @entity10 lowered the state 's flags , and got blow back for honoring an addict - precisely the kind of stigma he 's trying to change			1
addiction is a very personal issue for @entity10			1
his close friend from law school died of an overdose earlier this year			0
" i ca n't tell you how many times all of us - friends of his , dear friends - intervened and got him to treatment , dealt with his wife and his children and tried to help him			2
now , we could n't , " @entity10 told the audience			1
the governor wants to change the way the legal system treats nonviolent drug offenders , providing them treatment instead of jail sentences			1
still , he draws a bright line between destigmaizing drug addiction and decriminalizing drug use			2
" i think they 're two big differences right ? " @entity10 said			1
" i do n't think we should be telling our children this is ok			0
and by decriminalizing it , i think we 're telling them it 's ok			0
you should never make this choice in the first place , but if you do , and you become addicted and are subject to that disease , then we need to treat you and destigmatize that treatment			2
" but he added : " i do n't think decriminalization and destigmatization have to go together			0
in fact , i would argue that decriminalization would lead to more addicts and that 's not something we want			0
" @entity10 's comments mark a shift in tone among republicans when it comes to drugs			1
@entity150 first launched the so - called war on drugs and @entity153 kept the effort alive through the 1980s with her " just say no " campaign			0
but @entity10 says the war on drugs has failed			1
" the war on drugs was well - intentioned , " he said			0
" it just has not worked			0
we know much more today than we knew 30 years ago , that this is a disease -- about it being physiological , and in some places genetic -- and so we need to treat that disease			0
" he added : " i think mrs. @entity153 and those who fought the war on drugs that way absolutely were trying to be the most effective they could be and were operating with the best information they had at the time			0
but it 's been thirty plus years now , and we have more information and we should evolve over time to be more effective			0
" @entity10 's views on drug abusers - treating not jailing them - sets him apart from other high profile republicans , especially those considering a run for the @entity183			1
most potential 2016 @entity185 contenders are maintaining a hardline on drugs , if they talk about the issue at all			1
still , another potential 2016 candidate -- @entity185 sen. @entity190 , @entity191 -- comes closest to @entity10 with his push to curb the mandatory minimum drug sentencing that was once a staple of @entity6 tough on crime policy			1
@entity10 frames his views as consistent with self - described pro life conservatives , who value life above all else			1
but they could backfire with conservatives -- voters he needs to win the @entity185 presidential nomination -- who do n't see the connection			2
" listen , i 'll take whatever risk i need to take if i 'm telling the truth as i see it , and the fact is it was well - intentioned , " @entity10 said			1
" i 'm not worried about turning anybody off			0
i want to tell people the truth , " he said			0
but if @entity10 is so willing to use the personal experience of a friend overdosing to try to destigmatize drug abuse , what about his very different , very personal battle : his weight			1
after all , obesity is an epidemic in @entity220			0
" sure , i think at some point when appropriate , i would because i know that struggle personally and i know how difficult that is , " @entity10 said when asked whether he might the issue as part of his public platform			1
@entity10 's waist size has shrunk since he underwent lap - band surgery in 2013			1
but he was reluctant to tell people how they should lose weight			0
" i want to be careful because i do n't want to proselytize because i know how difficult it is to deal with this problem and i know it 's been more difficult at times when people who feel that [ they ] are struggling with it , that they 're being lectured , " @entity10 said			1
" i 've gone through that			0
" does he think obesity is an addiction ? " i do n't know the answer to that question but what i will tell you is that i know it 's a struggle and i 've had that struggle and continue to have that struggle , " @entity10 responded			1
" but i 'm doing well now and i want to continue doing well			0
" @entity10 held the drug forum as 2016 speculation intensifies			1
he sidestepped questions about whether @entity254 - a good friend of his - should make a third @entity183 run			0
" i have great respect and affection and admiration for @entity254 and for @entity260 , " he said			0
" they 're both real friends , not political friends			0
and that 's up to him			0
he gets to make that decision			0
if he wants to do it again , more power to him			0
if he does n't , that 's ok too			0
" @entity10 insists his own decision about whether to throw his hat in the presidential ring is " absolutely " independent of anyone else - from @entity254 to @entity276			1
so when will he decide ? " i 'll make a decision after the first of the year , " he said			0
he really has n't decided , we ask incredulously ? " i really have n't decided , " @entity10 says with a mischievous smile			2
" i 'm not kidding around			0
" @entity2 's @entity281 contributed to this report			2
