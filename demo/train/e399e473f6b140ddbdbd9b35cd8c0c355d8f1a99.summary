@entity0 is telling no tales			1
the older of the two brothers who allegedly committed the @entity4 bombings was likely the one who planned the attack , but when he died in a shootout with police just days after the blasts , his thoughts and motivations vanished with him			1
but the brain that was home to his angry mind remains , and in this case that may mean something			1
@entity0 was an amateur boxer who won the @entity19 competition as recently as 2009 and 2010			1
that speaks to a young man with a healthy sense of discipline and focus , and if he had a violent streak , it was violence well - channeled			2
what we know about the suspects but his sport of choice suggests the possibility of something else too : traumatic brain injury			1
as the @entity37 and other pro sports increasingly reckon with the early dementia , mental health issues , suicides and even criminal behavior of former players , the risk of what 's known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity47 ) , is becoming clear			1
roughly 4,000 former @entity37 players and 2,000 of their spouses are currently suing the league , claiming that the perils of head injuries were never explained to them and , indeed , that the players were pushed to get back on the field even when it was clear that they had suffered concussions			2
it was inevitable , then , that questions would be raised about whether @entity0 's brain may have been similarly traumatized during the years he boxed , and if there had indeed been damage , did that spark his alleged murderous behavior ? the answer is a likely yes to the first part and a likely no to the second			1
@entity69 : terrorists and mass shooters : more similar than we thought boxers are perhaps the best - studied victims of @entity47 , with the consequences of consistent trauma to the head described initially as " punch drunk , " but emerging as @entity47 in the 1950s , says dr. @entity79 , cofounder of the @entity80 for the @entity81			2
the term " better describes a neurodegenerative disease caused , at least in part , by repetitive brain trauma , " he says			1
the presence of @entity47 can only be confirmed postmortem , by looking for tau proteins in the brain -- produced when neural connections stretch and show signs of wear			1
whether the presence of those proteins , however , play any role in behavior is less clear			2
in general , older people with @entity47 exhibit problems with memory , attention span and the ability to learn new material -- all of the things we associate with alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia			2
they may also exhibit impulsiveness , anger , situational explosiveness and paranoia , which are familiar as well to families of people suffering from dementia			2
in younger people , the predominance of the symptoms is frequently reversed : outbursts and lack of impulse control come first , with an underlying loss of cognitive abilities eventually following			2
and that 's the problem with looking for cte in @entity124			2
authorities have n't revealed if they plan to examine his brain , and unless they have taken some necessary steps to preserve it for study , they may have lost that option already			1
but it may not matter			0
" the @entity137 bombing was a planned attack , " says dr. @entity133 , also of @entity80 and co-director of the @entity135			0
" there were lots of explosive devices put together in a very premeditated way			0
there was no flipping out here , no impulsiveness			0
that 's not what you see with @entity47 in younger people			0
" that does n't mean @entity0 did n't have brain trauma related to his boxing			1
" i think he did , " @entity133 says			0
it 's just that it may not have caused his alleged criminal behavior			0
@entity69 : brother 's keeper : did older sibling lure brother into plot ? that points to the difficulty of establishing any link between the condition of a brain and actions that may or may not result from it			1
@entity133 points to the case of the late pro wrestler @entity166 , who killed his wife and son and then himself in 2007			0
when his brain was studied after he died , it showed signs of @entity47 -- but here , too , it might have had little to do with his murderous behavior			1
" in @entity166 's case the behavior was again premeditated			0
it took place slowly , over the course of a weekend			0
he even sedated his son first so he would n't suffer , " @entity133 says			0
but triggered by @entity47 ? probably not			0
@entity69 : brothers in arms : sibling psychology and the bombing suspects for now , there is no cure for cte and the best treatment is prevention , which sports leagues from @entity192 football on up are beginning to address with rules changes and more stringent medical monitoring of players			0
as my colleague @entity199 reported in january , investigators at @entity198 have developed a still - experimental technique to detect @entity47 in the brains of living patients , using positron emission tomography ( @entity206 ) scans and a radioactive dye that clings to tau proteins			0
early diagnosis , if it becomes routine , could be used to keep already ill people away from contact sports and prevent their condition from being exacerbated by more hits			0
they might also be enrolled in treatment and therapy programs that would slow the onset of what for now are inevitable symptoms			0
while none of this likely would have deterred @entity0 from his alleged plot , it might be used to diagnose other people at risk of explosive @entity47 - related violence and stop them before they act out			1
by treating a single person 's wounded brain , doctors could one day save uncounted other lives			1

the brain of a bomber : did damage caused by boxing play a role in the @entity137 bombings ?			1

@entity0 was an amateur boxer who won competitions in 2009 and 2010
that raises questions on the possibility of traumatic brain injury
one expert says @entity0 likely did not have chronic traumatic encephalopathy
