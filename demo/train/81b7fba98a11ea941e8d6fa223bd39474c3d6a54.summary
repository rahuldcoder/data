@entity25 district judge @entity24 granted a stay on tuesday , finding @entity7 's lawyers showed the use of pentobarbital carried " a high risk of contamination and prolonged , unnecessary pain beyond that which is required to achieve death			1
" an intimate discussion with a serial killer " given the irreversible nature of the death penalty and plaintiffs ' medical evidence and allegations , a stay is necessary to ensure that the defendants ' last act against @entity7 is not permanent , irremediable cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the @entity47 , " @entity24 wrote			2

@entity3 had planned to use propofol , the surgical anaesthetic made infamous by the death of pop star @entity84			0
but gov. @entity85 reversed that decision after being warned the @entity87 -- whose members forbid capital punishment -- might halt shipments of the drug , leading to shortages for medical purposes			0
in october , the state announced it would use pentobarbital , which would be provided by an unnamed compounding pharmacy			0
