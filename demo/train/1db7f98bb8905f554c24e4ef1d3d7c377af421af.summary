-- @entity2 homeowners applying for debt writedowns will have to give up satellite television , foreign holidays and private school educations for their children under a strict new insolvency law introduced to tackle the country 's debt crisis			1
on thursday @entity2 's @entity11 set out monthly spending limits for people seeking debt deals from their creditors , highlighting the impact austerity is having on @entity2 spending habits			1
a single person will be allowed just â ‚ ¬ 247.04 a month for food , â ‚ ¬ 57.31 for heating and â ‚ ¬ 125.97 for " social inclusion and participation " , an expenses category that includes tickets for sporting events and the cinema			0
" a reasonable standard of living does not mean a person should live at luxury level , said @entity31 , director of the newly established @entity11 of @entity2			2
" but nor does it mean that people should be punished and live only at subsistence level , " in most cases , people seeking debt deals will also have to give up private health insurance and their cars , although they will be able to keep their vehicles if they do not have access to public transportion			1
the guidelines mark @entity2 's first attempt to quantify acceptable living standards when people declare bankruptcy or reach an insolvency arrangement with creditors under its new insolvency regime			1
banks will also use the guidelines as they begin restructuring tens of thousands of home loans over coming months			0
stubbornly high unemployment and falling wages , caused by a five - year economic crisis , have pushed almost one in four @entity2 mortgage holders to the brink			1
some 120,000 @entity2 mortgages are in arrears of 90 days or more			2
a further 100,000 loans have been restructured with short - term fixes			0
unlike many other @entity62 countries , including the @entity63 , @entity60 has included secured mortgage debt within its insolvency regime , in an effort to encourage banks to negotiate long - term restructuring deals with debtors			2
under @entity71 insolvency law , which is less proscriptive than @entity2 's new guidelines , " reasonable " day - to - day expenses for bankrupts include holidays , mobile phones and video rentals			1
while gym memberships , private health care , gambling , cigarettes and alcohol are considered unreasonable , @entity79 debtors do not face monthly cash limits			0
@entity86 , @entity2 's minister for justice , warned banks that they could face heavier losses if they did not agree debt deals with struggling mortgage holders , who might instead choose to declare bankruptcy			1
@entity94 prices have halved since the @entity2 's property market peaked in 2007 , leaving an estimated 400,000 mortgage holders with negative equity			1
unlike in some @entity100 states , mortgage holders can not escape debt obligations by surrendering their property to the bank			0
@entity2 banks that sell repossessed properties at a loss can pursue homeowners for the difference			2
last month @entity60 ordered banks to provide long - term solutions to struggling mortgage holders , prompting some concerns about the danger of " moral hazard "			0
" we will do write - offs			0
it is absolutely part of the give - and - take in a restructuring where both sides make concessions and it is not debt forgiveness , " said @entity118 , chief executive of @entity119			0
" anything that is done will be with full respect to the moral hazard that would be created , " he added			0

@entity2 debt applicants will have to give up satellite television , foreign holidays and private school
