-- right before the midterm elections of 2006 , @entity1 made the pitch to voters that the war in @entity6 would be in trouble if the @entity8 took over @entity9			1
apparently that was all the incentive the public needed to turn out in huge numbers and give @entity8 control of the @entity14 and @entity15 in a crushing midterm defeat			1
did it stop the war ? not at all			0
in fact , @entity1 doubled down , pushed through the troop surge and basically made it impossible for the 2008 presidential candidates to steer away from the military policies he set forth			2
in other words , losing the @entity14 and the @entity15 in the sixth year of your presidency does n't mean your legacy is done for			0
of course , @entity27 is no @entity1 , and that might be his undoing after a serious shellacking in this week 's midterms			1
first , let 's be honest about what happened tuesday night			0
the stock market is way up , unemployment is the lowest in six years and gas prices are way down			0
so , by most objective measures , the country is doing well			2
yet over 60 % of @entity39 say we 're on the wrong track , and the @entity8 got beat in blue and red states , across the country from @entity44 to @entity45			1
five red states voted to increase the minimum wage , a major @entity8 issue since 2012 , but at the same time those states voted overwhelmingly for @entity51 candidates who stand against minimum wage increases			1
and we ca n't forget just how much everyone hates @entity9			0
congressional approval has been less than 15 % for the last two years			0
how bad is that approval number ? to put it into perspective , 9 % of @entity39 have a favorable opinion of @entity59 , 11 % have a favorable opinion of @entity61 and 12 % have a favorable opinion of @entity63			0
so the @entity9 is just barely more popular than most of the @entity64 and a @entity66 leader who makes vague threats about nuclear war with the @entity39			2
this probably explains why president @entity27 was almost buoyant during his autopsy press conference wednesday afternoon , much more so than his last midterms in 2010			1
president @entity27 does n't have to " save " his presidency , but he does have some serious work to do in the next couple of months to make sure the next several years are n't a repeat of the pointless gridlock that has clogged congress since 2010			1
here are the key issues he must focus on : immigration : immigration reform is the holy grail of politics that is supposed to magically tie @entity84 voters to one party or another for the next 20 years			1
the truth is that immigration policy is both a serious domestic and national security issue that for too long has been obstructed by vehement tea partiers and limited by president @entity27 's overly cautious nature			1
the president 's plan to do immigration reform by executive order is actually a good idea , not just for his legacy , but also because it will either force the @entity51 to offer and pass a cohesive counter-bill , or simply let @entity27 handle the policy and move on			1
minimum wage : one of the great ironies of the midterm elections of 2014 was that @entity51 candidates generally ran against increasing the minimum wage , but the red states they were elected by voted to increase the minimum wage			0
right now , before @entity105 take over the @entity15 , the president should make a push to pass a minimum wage increase once again			0
he can frame a vote on the minimum wage as a gift to incoming @entity105			0
if @entity9 can pass a minimum wage bill before the new @entity9 starts in january , freshmen @entity105 wo n't be in the unenviable position of fighting against a policy overwhelmingly passed in their home states			0
civil rights : president @entity27 appears poised to pick @entity117 prosecutor @entity116 to replace @entity118 , a nomination that thus far should n't cause too much controversy			1
but he needs to cram through as many judges and appellate appointments as he can in the next several months			0
the @entity51 has refused to vote on , or just plain old rejected , a historic number of president @entity27 's judicial appointments			1
the president is now in a position to trade			0
@entity105 know that president @entity27 will likely veto the vast majority of the bills the new @entity15 will send him			1
perhaps in exchange for letting more judicial appointments through , and ending the confirmation logjam of appointments he 's already made , the president can offer concessions on the number and types of bills from the @entity51 that he 'll veto			0
foreign policy : the biggest challenge going forward for president @entity27 will likely be foreign policy			1
nuclear negotiations with @entity63 , sanctions on @entity66 and @entity140 will all be issues that expected new @entity15 committee heads like @entity144 , @entity145 , and @entity146 , @entity147 , will be champing at the bit to challenge president @entity27 on			1
of course , most of these issues can be managed tactfully by the president if he decides to act swiftly as opposed to simply bickering with the opposition			2
a final deal developed with @entity63 and the @entity153 can be signed , sealed and delivered by the november 24 deadline if the president acts fast enough			0
any tougher sanctions bills coming out of @entity9 in 2015 would look foolish when the president has already negotiated a deal			0
@entity146 will be calling for boots on the ground to fight @entity140 , and while that is something president @entity27 has stood against , the reality is that sending " security " support to the @entity163 could assuage some of @entity146 's blood lust and curry favor with other hawks over the next two years			1
the midterm elections were not good for the @entity8 , nor were they good for president @entity27			1
but this does n't mean he ca n't get any policies passed			2
it 's just a matter of how committed he is to working as quickly as he can with the " difficult " @entity9 he has in this lame duck session before the " impossible " @entity9 of 2015 comes into office			2
president @entity27 had one of the most productive periods of his presidency after the midterm elections in 2010 , and there 's no reason he ca n't accomplish similar policy goals now , if he 's willing to take the initiative , cut some deals and occasionally stand his ground instead of hoping for some mythical bipartisanship			2
on the actual policies , the president seems to have the support of the people			2
the question is whether he will take the hint and act on this			0
