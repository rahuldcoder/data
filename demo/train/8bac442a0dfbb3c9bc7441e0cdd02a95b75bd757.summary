pope @entity0 has told a @entity2 newspaper that he prefers not to use a bulletproof popemobile despite the dangers of an assassination attempt because it is a glass " sardine can " that walls him off from people			1
" it 's true that anything could happen , but let 's face it , at my age i do n't have much to lose , " he told @entity11 newspaper @entity10 in an interview published friday and reported on in @entity13 by @entity14			1
" i know that something could happen to me , but it 's in the hands of @entity23			2
" since an assassination attempt on then - pope @entity27 in 1981 , the head of the @entity25 has customarily used the custom - made glass - sided popemobile when in public			1
but @entity0 has taken his own approach to transport since assuming the papacy last year -- creating a headache for those tasked with ensuring his security			1

the @entity27 's recent trip to the @entity60 , during which he made stops in @entity62 , the @entity63 and @entity64 , is likely to have posed additional significant security challenges			2
but he sees being able to speak with and meet people directly as a key part of his pastoral role as pontiff			2
another @entity72 @entity71 ? in the interview with @entity10 , @entity0 also did not rule out following in the footsteps of his predecessor in the role , @entity54 , who stood down from the papacy citing age and frailty			1
@entity0 described @entity54 's retirement as a " great gesture " which opened the door to the creation of an institution of @entity72 @entity71 , as @entity54 is now known , according to @entity14			1
" as we live longer , we get to an age at which we can not carry on with things , " @entity0 said			1
" i will do the same as he did : ask the lord enlighten me when the moment comes and tell me what i have to do , and he will tell me for sure			0
" he speaks too of his commitment to interfaith relations and his hopes for @entity98 peace			0
asked finally how he would like to be remembered in history , @entity0 said he had n't thought about it , according to @entity14			1
" but , " he said , " i like it when you recall someone and say , ' he was a good guy , he did what he could , and he was not that bad			0
' with that , i would be content			0
