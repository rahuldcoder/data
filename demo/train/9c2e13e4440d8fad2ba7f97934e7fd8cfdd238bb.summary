-- i have always been a fiercely independent woman			1
i learned from my grandmother -- the breadwinner in her marriage -- that there was nothing that a woman could n't do as well as a man			1
i started working when i was 16 years old and , by all accounts , i had achieved a fairly high degree of success as a young journalist in my early 20s			2
a die - hard feminist , my desire for self - sufficiency did n't stem from a movement : it was personal			1
a child of divorced parents who always fought about money - related issues , and with my grandmother 's words etched in my mind , i told myself at a young age that i would never rely on a man or anyone to take care of me			1
i became so defiant about being able to do things on my own that i would rarely even let people buy me meals			2
that still holds true today			2
then , i met " @entity32 , " who was much older and more successful than me			1
we started dating in my early 30s at a time when my career had me traveling all over the world to report stories			1
i was neither looking for a relationship nor cared to be in one			2
a lot of my friends , however , were beginning to settle down and i started to feel like something was wrong with me for not being able to even fathom doing the same			2
that 's not to say i was n't happy with where i was : i loved my work and i loved the woman i had become			0
@entity32 was a nice man who seemed to take a liking to me quite quickly			1
like many men of similar ilk , @entity32 could be aggressive about acquiring things he wanted			0
before i knew it , i was being sucked into his vortex			0
one week we 'd be cruising the @entity54 in a massive full - service yacht , the next we 'd be on a shopping excursion in @entity57			1
it all happened so fast and i was being exposed to a part of the world that -- despite being well - traveled -- i had never experienced			1
it started to become glaringly apparent that i was being seduced by a lifestyle			1
i was becoming a sugar baby			0
or at least , that 's how i felt			0
college ' sugar babies ' date for cash we all know what sugar daddies are : wealthy older men have throughout history sought out much younger women -- " sugar babies " -- to date , even marry and take care of			1
despite the women 's liberation movement , our culture is always reminding us of gender roles			0
today , websites like @entity80 are making it that much easier for men and women to connect by waving the carrot of support and financial security to attract youth and beauty			0
@entity80 ceo says love does n't exist while i think @entity32 liked me because of my independent spirit , i 'm quite sure he hoped that the longer we were in a relationship together , the more likely it would be that i would eventually give up my career and let him support me			1
he was not at all a bad person , but increasingly , i was starting to feel owned and that i was losing myself			0
now there 's nothing wrong with being in a relationship in which one person financially supports the other			0
we all contribute to our relationships in different ways and in no way should any contribution be trivialized			0
i just knew that i was in mine for the wrong reasons and that i had compromised the woman i had worked so hard to become			1
i am now married and have a child with a man who is quite successful in his own right			2
i know that if i fall onto hard times , he 'll support me , and i will do the same			2
even though we 're equal partners in our marriage , it 's important for me to maintain my own identity , career and finances			0
" no matter what , " my grandma always said , " have your own money			0
" in a span of a lifetime , my relationship with @entity32 was a mere blip			0
but , it serves as a constant reminder of a time when i did n't recognize myself , and that did n't feel very good .			0
