@entity0 -- a group of @entity4 activists gathered in front of a @entity7 cathedral tuesday for the latest protest over a @entity10 reprimand of @entity12 's largest organization of @entity4 nuns			1
about two dozen parishioners and former clergy gathered in front of @entity17 , protesting last month 's controversial report from the @entity19 , the church 's doctrinal watchdog			1
following a years - long " doctrinal assessment " investigation of the @entity24 -- which represents 80 % of the @entity4 nuns in @entity26 -- the report found " serious doctrinal problems " and called for major reforms			1
it accused the @entity24 of sponsoring " certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the catholic faith in some of the programs and presentations			1
" " the sisters are wonderful people who work very hard , and yes , they do care about the poor , and they do care about social concerns , and the congregation of the dogma of the faith has come down on them really hard , " said @entity35 , one of the protesters gathered outside @entity37			0
" it is unfair , unjust , unconscionable , and i 'm here to support them			0
" @entity46 , with @entity47 , a catholic activist organization , organized a petition to rally support for sisters nationwide			2
" i would like to see the @entity10 rescind the mandate , but i think that would be doubtful judging from past actions , " she said , " but we always believe in the power of the @entity56 and peace			2
peace and reconciliation is everyone 's goal			0
" last week , crowds gathered in @entity63 in a similar protest			1
while praising the group 's work on social justice issues , the @entity10 blamed it for remaining " silent on the right to life from conception to natural death , a question that is part of the lively public debate about abortion and euthanasia in the @entity26			1
" " further , issues of crucial importance to the life of @entity80 and society , such as the @entity80 's @entity83 view of family life and human sexuality , are not part of the @entity24 agenda in a way that promotes @entity80 teaching , " the report said			0
it also noted public statements from nuns that opposed catholic bishops			2
the @entity24 disagreed with the bishops ' conference 's position on the @entity98 , which they supported and the bishops did not			0
the church called the @entity24 's position " grave and a matter of serious concern			0
