-- tuesday was anything but a routine day for deputy @entity2 , who spent three hours in his patrol car after nearly 50,000 honeybees decided to park on it			1
the @entity7 officer had responded around 9:40 a.m. to a call of a person possibly being attacked by bees			2
he found a disabled truck on @entity12 64 a few miles east of @entity13 , @entity14			1
behind it was a trailer holding 60 boxes of bees			2
the truck driver , who was headed for @entity19 , had been hauling the bees at night , when they are quiet and not apt to fly			2
he spent a couple hours after daybreak trying to get someone to tow the trailer and his truck			1
that 's when @entity2 , 31 , pulled up 50 yards behind in his @entity26			0
by then , the day was beginning to warm			0
" the bees were hot and bothered , " said @entity27 , one of two beekeepers who later swarmed to @entity2 ' assistance			1
it was not clear how the bees got away from the truck , but a lid from one box was seen on the side of the road			1
" it was mind - boggling how many bees were out there , " @entity2 told @entity0			2
eventually , the vehicles were towed off , leaving him still in his @entity43			2
" i was told that usually when a truck starts moving , the bees will follow behind			2
@entity46 , who assisted @entity27 , said the leftover bees were likely drawn to the light color of the @entity43			0
the insects spent the next three hours crawling over the vehicle , especially on the trunk and side panels			1
" at some point , it was hard to see out of the windows , " said @entity2			1
@entity27 , a hobbyist , and @entity46 , a honeybee technician at @entity58 , went to work			0
" they got a little testy , " said @entity27 who , like @entity46 , was not wearing a protective body suit			0
they used smoke on the bees , which @entity46 says " masks their communication , " and a spray bottle of sugar water			1
the sticky mix makes it harder for the bees to fly and they concentrate on grooming themselves rather than attacking humans			0
at some point , @entity2 was advised to drive his patrol car some distance to blow the bees off			1
but that did n't work			0
eventually , the beekeepers brushed the bees onto a piece of plastic and then into a hive box			1
@entity46 and @entity27 between them were stung only three or four times			0
@entity2 said about six bees got in his patrol car			1
he dispatched a couple when " they got too close to my personal space			0
" tuesday 's incident was an unusual demonstration of how bees stick together			0
" they pull together as a unit , " said @entity46			0
" as a whole , they are quite amazing			0

@entity14 deputy spent three hours in car because of bees
two beekeepers came to his assistance , using smoke and sugar water
@entity109 deputy : " at some point , it was hard to see out of the windows "
eventually , nearly 50,000 bees were driven into hive box
