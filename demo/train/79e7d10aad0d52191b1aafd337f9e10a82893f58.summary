-- my son had barely taken his first breath when the people in the hospital started telling me how lucky i was			1
not because he was healthy , mind you , but because he was a he			0
" it 's easier to raise boys , " i was told			1
and for a while i actually believed them			0
then i started paying attention			0
did you know boys are more likely to drop out of high school than girls ? or that there are more female college students than male ? and did you know the imprisonment rate for men is roughly 15 times higher than the rate for women ? if this is what boys being easier to raise than girls looks like , coul`d you imagine how many men would be in jail if raising girls got any harder ? we worry so much about girls getting hurt -- and justifiably so -- but interestingly enough , the stats show it 's our boys who are more likely to get robbed , attacked or even murdered			1
we see girls as fragile orchids and boys as plastic plants			1
but let 's face it : at the core of this line of thinking is n't safety -- it 's sex			2
when someone offers this piece of advice , it 's with the thinking that girls have to be protected from boys who will say and do just about anything to get in their pants			1
what 's typically missing from this discussion is the challenge to parents -- particularly fathers -- not to raise a liar and a cheat			2
true , parents of boys do not have to worry about them coming home pregnant , but does that mean an unplanned pregnancy can be considered " the girl 's problem " ? after all , a boy 's girlfriend did not get pregnant asexually			1
that 's why i 'm tebowing day and night , hoping my 15 - year - old has the will to stay away from sex -- even though the world all around him tells him there 's something wrong with him if he does			0
a little girl who likes to play sports is called a tomboy			0
a little boy who does n't like to play sports is called weird			2
a teen girl who says " no " is called a good girl			0
a teen boy who says " no " is called a sissy			2
a lot of words describe what it 's like for parents who are trying to teach their teenage son how to be his own man in a high school setting that demands conformity , but " easy " is not one of them			2
i know , i know , " boys will be boys " is the accepted rule of thumb			2
but given that we have a federal department that hunts down and sometimes arrests deadbeat fathers , does n't that raise the question : what kind of boys are we raising ? and if they 're dropping out of high school at a faster clip than girls , why do we think raising them is easier ? last year , i wrote a piece with the headline " parents , do n't dress your girls like tramps			1
" i received a lot of e-mails from offended readers who told me i had no idea how hard it was to avoid buying sexy clothing for their little princesses			0
i usually responded by reminding them i never said it was n't hard			0
and then i asked if they 've ever seen the words on many of the t - shirts aimed at young men			0
they may not be blatantly inappropriate , like a cut - off shirt that reveals their bellybuttons , but if i had a dollar for every t - shirt i 've read that sexualizes the words " balls , " " sticks " or " size , " i could retire			0
i guess if parents do n't care if their son thinks being a man begins and ends with his penis , then yes , i can see how some would think raising a boy is easier			1
but if you 're actually trying to raise a gentleman , and you hear @entity157 rap " i 'm running through these hos like @entity153 " -- as they do in " @entity159 , " the second most popular song of 2011 -- then you 're not breathing a sigh of relief because it 's so much easier to raise a boy			1
instead you 're wondering how much of what you 're trying to teach him soaks in , versus what our culture says is ok			0
we 've made so many advances as a society in terms of gender equity , and yet we still hold on to this nonsensical double standard that celebrates sexually active boys while demonizing their female counterparts , as if we can have a lot of one without the other			1
this kind of thinking is handed down from generation to generation almost as soon as the umbilical cord is cut			0
but how can we continue to believe boys are easier to raise than girls , when only 42 % of custodial moms received all of their child support payments in 2009 ? some see loose women in that statistic			1
i see some men who are punks			0
perhaps if we stopped viewing raising our boys as easier , we would n't have to deal with so many men who still behave like boys later in life			1

when his son was born , people told @entity204 it was easier to raise a boy
boys are more likely to be *dropouts* and go to jail , he says , less likely to go to college
parents have to fight a culture that encourages boys to be sexually active , he says
girls can be tomboys , he writes , but boys are *bullied* if they are n't " male " enough
