-- as another @entity2 comes to pass , it 's worth reflecting on the legacy of @entity4 and its workers			1
@entity4 's bankruptcy is a warning to other cities -- and even states -- that public pension systems are a ticking time bomb with potentially catastrophic consequences			1
unfunded pension debt , which in @entity4 stands at $ 3.5 billion and is roughly one - sixth of the city 's total debt , is a national problem that has already put other city and state governments on the same road to insolvency			2
the problem is being ignored amid a rash of finger - pointing and blame - shifting			0
few are calling for the kind of pension reforms that could prevent other places from encountering the @entity4 's crisis			1
quite simply , cities and states need to consider switching from the prevailing " defined benefit " pension plans to the " defined contribution " plans common in the private sector			1
this single fix could drastically change the course of a government 's financial health by making retirement plan for public - sector workers affordable for taxpayers and predictable for actuaries			2
first , consider the illness			0
@entity4 's pension debt pales in comparison to the hundreds of billions of dollars that other cities and municipalities owe their pensioners			1
opinion : @entity4 , the ' used to be ' city @entity50 , for instance , is much worse off than @entity4 , with some $ 69.9 billion in pension debts			2
the only difference between the @entity53 and the @entity4 is that it the former has a burgeoning economy that masks the looming crisis , keeping the tax bill at bay even as the pension debt grows larger			2
worse yet , city pension debt is dwarfed by that of state pension debt			0
in @entity66 , the unfunded total in the state 's two pension funds is $ 47 billion			2
next door , @entity50 faces pension debts of $ 133 billion , while @entity70 ' clocks in at $ 167 billion			0
@entity71 is the worst , with $ 370 billion in unfunded pension liabilities			0
combined , city and state unfunded pension debts amount to $ 4.6 trillion , according to an analysis published by @entity77 , a conservative - leaning group			0
the crisis is recognized by many , but unfortunately , most of the proposed solutions are either shortsighted or just plain silly			0
in @entity70 , for instance , gov. @entity81 at one point suggested a federal bailout of the state 's pension debt , a call that has been echoed by many for @entity4			1
given the federal government 's own fiscal problems , this proposal has been dismissed as irresponsible			0
tax increases are another option			0
one analysis estimated that an average tax hike of $ 1,385 per household would be required to fix the debt			0
in my home state of @entity66 , we estimate that working families will soon need to contribute an additional $ 878 per year to pay rising pension costs -- a devastating blow to those still recovering from the recession			0
while the problem is already enormous , it will only get worse in the coming years unless governments transition to defined contribution systems , like the 401 ( k )			0
robocop creator : @entity4 shows the film 's fictional future is upon us both defined benefit plans -- which purport to guarantee a set income for life -- and 401 ( k ) - type plans carry with them some risk for public employees			1
in the case of defined benefit plans , @entity4 shows that taxpayers may not always be able to pay what the government promises			2
as for the @entity126 , individual retirement investments are subject to the ups and downs of the market , requiring more attention , planning and personal responsibility on the part of the employee			1
the private sector , being more responsive to market pressures , realized the dangers posed by defined benefit plans and the benefits of 401 ( k ) s long ago and acted accordingly			1
from 1979 to 2011 , the percentage of businesses offering defined benefit plans plummeted from 62 % to a mere 7 %			0
over the same period , defined contribution plans more than quadrupled from 16 % to 69 %			0
businesses made these changes because defined benefit plans are unpredictable , inefficient and too costly in the long run			1
but cities and states are n't so different : they can pass costs on to taxpayers and their children only for so long , until eventually -- as in @entity4 -- the bill comes due			1
unfortunately , @entity4 's public pensioners will likely pay this bill themselves when their pensions are cut in bankruptcy proceedings			1
they need only look to @entity157 , @entity71 , which received court approval to do just that on august 28			0
opinion : how @entity4 can rise again but other cities and states can still prevent the crisis from boxing their own public workers into a similar financial bind			1
if governments across the nation seize the moment and make the change to a defined contribution system -- as @entity66 is poised to do this fall -- they 'll save their citizens from a fate like @entity4 's , where opportunity and prosperity have been replaced by bankruptcy and hoped - for bailouts			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

@entity179 : @entity4 's pension mess is a warning to other cities and states
@entity179 : solution is to switch to 401 ( k ) plans which is common in the private sector
he says market risks of 401 ( k ) s require more personal responsibility for workers
@entity179 : if cities and states keep the pension system , it will be too costly in the long run
