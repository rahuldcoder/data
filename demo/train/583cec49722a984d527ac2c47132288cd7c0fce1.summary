-- calling himself " deeply flawed , " now - disgraced cyclist @entity1 says he used an array of performance enhancing drugs to win seven @entity7 titles then followed that by years of often - angry denials			1
" this is too late , it 's too late for probably most people			0
and that 's my fault , " he said in an interview with @entity13 that aired thursday night			0
" ( this was ) one big lie , that i repeated a lot of times			0
" @entity1 admitted using testosterone and human growth hormone , as well as @entity21 -- a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production			1

in addition to using drugs , the 2002 @entity31 admitted to @entity13 that he took blood transfusions to excel in the highly competitive , scandal - ridden world of professional cycling			1
doping was as much a part of the sport as pumping up tires or having water in a bottle , @entity1 said , calling it " the scariest " that he did n't consider it cheating at the time			1
12 telling quotes over the years from @entity1 the same man who insisted throughout and after his career that he 'd passed each of the " hundreds and hundreds of tests i took " contended in the interview that he would n't have won without doing what he did			1
while @entity1 did n't invent the culture of doping in cycling , he said , he admitted not acting to prevent it either			1
" i made my decisions , " @entity1 said			1
" they are my mistakes			0
" @entity1 : i was " a bully " the first installment in his interview , which was conducted earlier this week with the talk - show host , aired thursday on the own cable network and on the @entity65			1
the second installment will be broadcast friday night			0
@entity1 admitted he was " a bully ... in the sense that i tried to control the narrative , " sometimes by spewing venom at ex-teammates he thought were " disloyal , " as well as suing people and publications that accused him of cheating			1
he described himself as " a fighter " whose story of a happy marriage , recovery from cancer and international sporting success " was so perfect for so long			0

" i was used to controlling everything in my life			2
" @entity88 : tell us your take on the first part of the interview the scandal has tarred the cancer charity livestrong that he founded , as well as tarnished his once - glowing reputation as a sports hero			2
those who spoke out against @entity1 at the height of his power and popularity not only felt his wrath but the wrath of an adoring public			1
now , with @entity1 stripped of endorsement deals and his titles , those who did speak out are feeling vindicated			1
they include @entity109 , wife of fellow cyclist @entity110 , who said she overheard @entity1 acknowledge to a doctor treating him for cancer in 1996 that he had used performance - enhancing drugs			1
she later testified about the incident and began cooperating with a reporter working on a book about doping allegations against @entity1			1
@entity1 subsequently ripped her , among others			1
more recently , he said he 'd reached out to her to apologize -- in what @entity110 called " a very emotional phone call			2
" " this was a guy who used to be my friend , who decimated me , " @entity110 told @entity0 's @entity121 on thursday night			1
" he could have come clean			0
he owed it to me			0
he owes it to the sport that he destroyed			0
" in his interview with @entity13 , @entity1 said he understands why many might be upset that it took him so long to speak out , especially after going on the offensive for so long			1
he said he 's reached out in recent days to several people , such as @entity110 , who publicly accused him of doping and then were attacked -- and in some cases sued -- by him			2
@entity135 : @entity136 erupts thursday night and the former athletic icon also conceded he 'd let down many fans " who believed in me and supported me " by being adamant , sometimes hurtful and consistently wrong in his doping denials			1
" they have every right to feel betrayed , and it 's my fault , " he said			0
" i will spend the rest of my life ... trying to earn back trust and apologize to people			1
" years of success and defiance , then a rapid fall the @entity151 - born @entity1 grew up to become an established athlete , including winning several @entity7 stages			1
but his sporting career ground to a halt in 1996 when he was diagnosed with cancer			0
he returned to the cycling world , however			0
his breakthrough came in 1999 , and he did n't stop as he reeled off seven straight wins in his sport 's most prestigious race			0
allegations of doping began during this time , as did @entity1 's defiance , including investigations and a lawsuit against the author of a book accusing him of taking performance enhancing drugs			1
he left the sport after his last win , in 2005 , only to return to the tour in 2009			0
@entity1 insisted he was clean when he finished third that year , but that comeback led to his downfall			2
" we would n't be sitting here if i did n't come back , " he told @entity13			2

but his fight to maintain his clean reputation was n't over , including a criminal investigation launched by federal prosecutors			0
that case was dropped in february			0
but in april , the @entity183 notified @entity1 of an investigation into new doping charges			1
in response , the cyclist accused the organization of trying to " dredge up discredited " doping allegations and , a few months later , filed a lawsuit in federal court trying to halt the case			2
in retrospect , @entity1 told @entity13 he " would do anything to go back to that day			1
" " because i would n't fight , i would n't sue them , i 'd listen , " he said , offering to speak out about doping in the future			0
the @entity183 found " overwhelming " evidence that @entity1 was involved in " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program			1
" in august , @entity1 said he would n't fight the charges , though he did n't admit guilt either			2
and the hits kept on coming			0
in october , the @entity202 stripped him of all his @entity7 titles			0
even then , he remained publicly defiant , tweeting a photo of himself a few weeks later lying on a sofa in his lounge beneath the seven framed yellow jerseys from those victories			0
then the @entity210 stripped him of the bronze medal he won in the men 's individual time trial at the @entity214 and asked him to return the award , an @entity210 spokesman said thursday			0
the @entity218 was notified wednesday that the @entity210 wants the medal back , @entity218 spokesman @entity217 said			0
