@entity0 -- an @entity3 court says it convicted @entity4 and her former boyfriend of murdering her onetime roommate in part because of evidence showing that more than one person killed the @entity11 student			1
the @entity13 appeals court released its explanation tuesday , less than three months after it convicted @entity15 and @entity16 in @entity18 's 2007 death in a retrial			1
in the more than 300 - page document , the court said that a third person convicted in the murder , @entity18 , did not act alone , and cited the nature of the victim 's wounds			1
ruling judge @entity26 , who presided over the second appeal in the case , said @entity29 , 21 , and @entity15 disagreed over the payment of the rent in the house they shared in @entity34 and that " there was an argument , then an elevation and progression of aggression			2
" the @entity13 court in january said that @entity15 , who also was convicted of slander , was sentenced in absentia to 28Â½ years in prison			1
@entity16 's sentence was 25 years			1
they were first convicted of murder in 2009 , but the verdicts were overturned on appeal in 2011			1
through her attorney , @entity15 released a statement proclaiming her innocence			2
" i have stated from the beginning of this long ordeal that i am innocent of the accusations against me			0
i was found innocent by the only court in @entity3 that retained independent forensic experts to review my case			2
" i want to state again today what i have said throughout this process : i am innocent of the accusation against me , and the recent @entity64 document does not -- and can not -- change the fact of my innocence , " she said			0
now that the explanation of the verdict has been released , defense lawyers have 90 days to appeal to @entity3 's high court			2
in the document , @entity26 focuses on the perceived errors of the appellate court that set @entity15 and @entity16 free , accusing it of the " absence of logic rigor " when evaluating evidence			1
he wrote that some evidence , including a prison diary @entity15 wrote in the early days of her incarceration , was used to support her innocence when it was " convenient , but at the same time devalued when she incriminated herself			2
" the judge also reasoned that @entity15 's false accusation of her former boss , @entity18 , whom she accused of the killing the night she was arrested , proved her guilt			1
@entity91 spent nearly two weeks in prison without @entity15 correcting her false accusation			0
he was released when @entity94 was arrested after his fingerprints were found in at the murder scene			0
@entity26 wrote that the accusation against @entity91 was " indispensable in understanding the crime " and that the accusation " can not be separated from the murder			0
" @entity26 also considered credible forensic testimony that the first appellate court dismissed , including traces of mixed blood and dna belonging to both @entity15 and @entity29 that were identified in the bathroom that the women shared			2
" @entity94 , @entity15 and @entity16 left traces of their movements in the blood of the victim that was flowing profusely from her wounds , " the judge wrote			1
@entity26 excluded the idea that @entity94 climbed into the apartment through a window after breaking it with a rock as the @entity15 and @entity16 defense teams presented in earlier trials			1
he also excluded the idea put forth by @entity94 's defense that @entity29 let him in for a prearranged meeting			0
instead , he wrote : " the court accepts the position that only @entity4 was in possession of the other key to the apartment " and that she let him in			2
@entity26 dismissed all theories related to a sex game gone wrong			0
prosecutors had argued @entity29 was stabbed to death after she rejected attempts by @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity94 to involve her in a sex game			1
instead , @entity26 wrote that the suspects did not need to " share a motive			0
" he said a knife with @entity15 's dna on the handle found in @entity16 's apartment was the weapon that killed @entity29 and that @entity15 left her dna on the handle when she " plunged the knife into the left side of @entity29 's neck , causing the fatal wound			1
" in the initial trial , a tiny spot of @entity105 identified on the blade of that knife was attributed to @entity29 , but the sample was too small to double test			0
@entity26 nonetheless considered it the primary weapon			0
he reasoned that @entity16 used another knife and took it with him when he left			0
" the @entity159 girl was attacked by @entity4 , by @entity16 , who was backing up his girlfriend , and by @entity94 , " @entity26 wrote			1
@entity94 is the only person in jail for the slaying , and many aspects of the crime remain unexplained			0
@entity15 and @entity16 have maintained their innocence , and their 2009 convictions led to questions about the effectiveness of @entity3 's justice system			1
the trial revealed widespread doubts over the handling of the investigation and key pieces of evidence			0
but in march 2013 , @entity3 's @entity178 overturned their acquittals and ordered a retrial			0
that proceeding resulted in the convictions being reinstated			0
@entity15 's conviction has raised questions about her possible extradition to @entity3 to serve her sentence ; she was in the @entity188 and did not attend the retrial			1
@entity1 's @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report			0

new : " i am innocent , " says @entity4
she was first convicted of murder in 2009
@entity15 's former boyfriend , @entity16 , was also convicted
an appeals court overturned the convictions in 2011
