-- @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 dramatically cut their oil imports from @entity6 in february following intense @entity8 efforts to persuade @entity10 buyers to comply with @entity12 sanctions on @entity6 's central bank			1
@entity10 countries are collectively the biggest buyers of @entity6 crude oil , accounting for about 65 per cent of @entity18 's sales , but their responses to @entity12 's sanctions campaign have been mixed			1
@entity1 and @entity22 have both resisted the @entity8 and @entity24 sanctions on @entity6 , whereas @entity3 and @entity2 have broadly committed to follow the @entity8 lead			1
pressure on @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity22 to further reduce their imports of @entity6 oil intensified this week when @entity30 , @entity8 secretary of state , announced that @entity3 and ten @entity32 countries had qualified for exemptions from @entity8 penalties on institutions that deal with @entity6 's central bank			1
these 11 countries had " significantly reduced " the volume of crude they purchased from @entity6 , according to mrs @entity30 's statement			0
although @entity1 and @entity2 were left off the exemption list , the trade data suggest that both countries are on track to qualify for exemptions in coming months , according to analysts			1
the drop in february imports comes after several @entity10 countries , including @entity1 and @entity3 , cut their imports of @entity6 crude in january			1
@entity1 , the biggest buyer of @entity6 crude , usually accounts for one - fifth of @entity6 's crude exports but in february @entity1 's purchases plummeted to 290,000 barrels a day , a 40 per cent drop from the previous year			1
@entity2 's imports of @entity6 oil fell 16 per cent in february from the previous month to 5.9m barrels , a slight increase from the same month a year earlier but below monthly averages in 2011			1
@entity2 's monthly import data tends to be highly volatile			0
the value of @entity3 's total imports from @entity6 fell 34 per cent in february from the previous year			2
crude oil makes up the great majority of @entity3 's imports from @entity6 , although @entity3 does not specifically disclose its oil purchases from @entity6			0
@entity6 oil production has fallen to a 10 - year low and could drop further as sanctions over its nuclear programme disrupt an industry already suffering from years of under - investment			1
@entity18 produced 3.38m b / d in february , according to the @entity74 , the lowest level since late 2002			0
despite @entity1 's obvious drop in @entity6 oil purchases , @entity76 is officially firmly opposed to the @entity8 and @entity24 sanctions			1
" the market perception is that the drop in crude imports from @entity6 is not a signal that @entity1 is following @entity8 / @entity24 sanctions , but more related to pricing issues that were being worked out at the time , " said @entity80 , head of @entity10 commodities research at @entity82			1
" it is likely that we will see a rebound in @entity6 oil supply to @entity1 in subsequent months			2
" according to a senior academic , @entity1 does not want to give the impression that it is caving in to @entity8 pressure			0
@entity97 , a @entity98 specialist at the @entity99 , said : " the reason @entity1 cut imports from @entity6 is not because of the sanctions			2
we hope the @entity8 does n't see this as a result of their pressure and try to use this in future			0
" nevertheless analysts say @entity1 's cut in imports put it in line to receive a waiver from the @entity8 , similar to the one announced this week for @entity3			2
@entity2 is in ongoing talks with the @entity8 about cutting its oil purchases from @entity6 and receiving a waiver , but has not committed to a specific reduction target			2
@entity22 , which accounts for about 12 per cent of @entity6 crude sales , has not yet disclosed its february purchases of @entity6 crude			0
in january @entity22 's imports of @entity6 crude rose 19 per cent from the previous year			0
before the threat of sanctions , @entity122 was @entity3 's largest importer of oil from @entity6 , with about 100,000 b / d from @entity6			0
a spokesman said he could not disclose any details on the renewal of annual contracts with @entity6 suppliers , but that @entity122 would " reduce import volumes , according to the agreement between the @entity3 and the @entity8 government			0
" @entity1 's two biggest importers of @entity6 crude are @entity136 and @entity137 , which are both state - owned			2
@entity136 could not be reached for comment			0
@entity140 in @entity141 and @entity142 in @entity143 and @entity144 in @entity145			0

cut of oil imports come after @entity8 efforts to persuade @entity10 buyers to comply with @entity12 's sanctions
@entity1 and @entity2 are likely to qualify for exemptions in the coming months
@entity6 oil production has fallen to a 10 - year low and could drop further
