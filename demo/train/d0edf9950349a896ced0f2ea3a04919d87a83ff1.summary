@entity0 -- impassioned wrangling over changing the way the military prosecutes sex assaults pits the 20 women in the @entity6 against each other in a thorny political battle over an institution where chain of command is sacred			1
a bipartisan measure championed by sen. @entity12 that would have removed military commanders from decisions on whether to prosecute subordinates for rape , sexual assault and other serious crimes fell short in a procedural vote on thursday			1
@entity12 , of @entity20 , argued that commanders too often are biased in their decisions on such matters , and proposed placing the responsibility with " non-biased , professionally trained military prosecutors			1
" efforts to defeat @entity12 's bill were led by fellow @entity29 and @entity31 member , sen. @entity30 of @entity32			1
by the numbers : women in the @entity36 military @entity12 and @entity30 have fought for months over how best to reform the prosecution process for military sexual assaults			1
@entity12 would go outside of the traditional military command structure to force change ; @entity30 's approach is to reform from within			1
both spoke with sexual assault victims , members of the military and fellow lawmakers			2
their competing measures also divided the newly expanded female caucus of senators with most of them , including fellow @entity31 member sen. @entity51 of @entity52 , siding with @entity12			1
a number of women 's rights groups also backed her bill			0
" forty five @entity36 senators blocked all justice for survivors of sexual assault in the military , and that is a travesty			2
today 's results show just how pervasive rape culture in @entity36 has become , and how hard we will have to fight to overcome it , " @entity63 , co-founder of @entity64 , a women 's rights group , said in a statement thursday following the vote			0
" we wo n't stop fighting , and the 45 senators who voted in support of rape culture today should be ashamed for not fighting with us			0
" @entity12 's bill also had the support of several veterans groups			2
" this was a missed opportunity for @entity6 leaders to overhaul the military 's broken system of combating sexual trauma			0
they have turned their back on veterans and service members who pushed for reform , " said @entity82 , chief executive and founder of @entity84 and @entity85 , a military advocacy group			2
" instead , the @entity6 has chosen to keep the status quo			0
our lawmakers should be able to provide a fair and effective military justice system worthy of our veterans and service members , " he said			0
@entity6 blocks military sexual assault bill @entity12 's bill also had the support of the majority of the @entity6 , including potential 2016 @entity102 presidential contenders sen. @entity103 of @entity104 and sen. @entity105 of @entity106			1
supporters cite a recent @entity109 study that showed an estimated 26,000 incidents of sex assault and unwanted sexual contact in 2012 , but just over 10 % of those were reported			1
" the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result , " @entity103 said of the argument that that military commanders should be allowed to decide whether to prosecute rapes and sexual assault			0
however , @entity12 's measure was staunchly opposed by both the @entity109 and the bipartisan leaders of the @entity31 including @entity124 @entity123 sen. @entity123 who had choice words for @entity102 presidential hopefuls who backed the bill			0
rape victims say military labels them ' crazy ' @entity30 argued that reforms that became law last year will increase sexual assault prosecutions			1
those reforms include : removing the authority of commanders to overturn convictions ; providing attorneys to victims ; making it a crime to retaliate against a victim ; and requiring a dishonorable discharge for anyone convicted of sexual assault			0
the @entity6 did pass a separate bill thursday authored by @entity30 that adds to new changes to the reforms adopted last year			2
the measure , which passed easily with @entity12 's support , nixes the so - called " good soldier " defense , which allows defendants to present evidence of their good military character at sexual assault trials			1
@entity30 has a measure , co-sponsored by @entity102 sens. @entity155 of @entity156 and @entity157 of @entity158 , who also sit on the @entity31 that would allow an outside civilian review to weigh in if a military commander and prosecutor disagree on sexual assault prosecution			1
a vote on that bill is expected next week			0
groping allegation against @entity167 officer who helps fight sex crime the political showdown over the sexual assault measure unfolded on the same day @entity171			2
gen. @entity172 , who had been accused of " forcible sodomy , " plead guilty to having an affair with that service member -- a military crime -- and to improper sexual conduct with two other subordinates			0
additionally on thursday , news broke the @entity167 was investigating an officer whose job it was to train prosecutors on sexual assault for allegedly groping an @entity167 lawyer in 2011 at a conference			0
@entity1 senior congressional producer @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
