but the former @entity13 rapper is not the only one profiting from his headphone line			0
across the @entity16 in southern @entity1 , counterfeit beats are flowing out of factories , assembly workshops and shops , attracting businesspeople that sell the headphones on global markets			1
a @entity2 reporter approached wholesale companies about buying in bulk in order to learn how the underground sale of knock - off headphones works			1
" business is very good , " said a woman , who , with her family , runs a wholesale company selling copied headphones in one of @entity0 's many mega-malls			1
" you buy cheap from me , you sell expensive in your home country , we all make a lot of money , " she added			1
to prove her point , she shows an @entity43 spread sheet on her laptop listing customers from all over the world : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and more			0
she said she recently sold a large amount of counterfeit @entity6 for $ 50,000 to a @entity57 businessman who sent them to the @entity57 by jet -- which is considerably more expensive than container ship -- and sold them as originals			1

the long corridors are filled with cigarette smoke that drifts out from the tiny workshops as deliverymen rush by with their arms full of electronic components			0
everywhere you hear the sound of packing tape being wrapped around cardboard boxes			0
the counterfeit boom is fed , these days , by the rise of high - end headphones that dr. @entity3 's audio products helped kickstart with the launch of beats in 2008 , analysts say			1
just a few years ago , few people would be ready to pay several hundred dollars for a pair of headphones			0
now , with celebrities like @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 putting their names to signature pairs , @entity6 is the hottest brand for stylish music lovers			2
" today , the premium headphone market is defined by fashion and brands as much as it is by sound quality , " @entity132 , director of industry analysis at market research firm @entity134 said in a recent report			0
" one third of premium headphone buyers are under the age of 25 and many of these consumers view headphones as equal parts listening device and fashion accessory			2

the sound quality is surprisingly good			0
in the @entity50 , an original pair would cost $ 400			1
she offers her best quality headphones for the wholesale price of $ 70 , medium quality for $ 45 and " so - so quality " for $ 30			1
