-- @entity2 ceo @entity1 might soon be sharing @entity4 's most expensive cup of coffee			1
sometime in the next year , @entity1 will sit down for a cup of mud with someone who has paid at least $ 210,000 for the privilege			1
@entity2 fandom taken to its craziest , and costliest , extreme ? perhaps			2
but it 's all for a good cause			0
@entity1 has volunteered , through the online - auction site @entity15 , to share up to an hour of his precious time with two lucky ( and deep - pocketed ) winners			2
proceeds from the auction will go to @entity20 , an international nonprofit founded as a memorial to @entity22 by his family and friends			0
in the auction 's first day , @entity1 had gotten 52 bids , starting at $ 5,000 and spiraling upward quickly			1
the leading bid thursday evening was $ 210,000 , and there were still 19 days to go until bidding closes may 14			1
the coffee chat will happen at @entity2 's @entity31 , @entity32 , headquarters			1
the winner may bring along one guest			0
the move fits in with the more open public persona @entity1 has adopted since replacing late @entity2 ceo and co-founder @entity37			1
one of the knocks on @entity37 was that he never contributed much of his considerable fortune , or celebrity , to charity -- at least not in the public ways other tech titans like @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity49 's @entity48 have			0
by some measures , a $ 180,000 coffee meeting with the chief of the world 's leading tech company might be a bargain			1
an anonymous bidder paid $ 3.4 million last year for lunch with investor @entity58			0
@entity60 : in 50 years , people will forget @entity37 other celebs taking part in the auction for the @entity65 include @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			0
but if you think @entity2 's typical hyper - controlling approach to its world will be relaxed during @entity1 's coffee klatch , think again			1
for one , there will be no live - tweeting			0
" the winner can not blog , social network , talk to press , write about , take pictures or record during the experience in any way due to security regulations , " reads the auction 's legal terms			2
visitors will be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement and are subject to a security screening			1
" we expect all winning bidders and their guests to conduct themselves appropriately when attending an experience won at @entity94 , " the terms continue			0
" @entity96 manners and respect for the generous donor and adherence to any rules or parameters are a must			0
" travel and lodging for the visit , which will last between 30 minutes and an hour , are not covered			0
no word on whether @entity1 will pick up the tab for the coffee .			2

want to meet @entity2 ceo @entity1 ? he 's auctioning a coffee talk for *big* bucks
the visit will benefit @entity20 and human *rights*
as of thursday evening , the top bidder had *pledged* $ 210,000
