@entity0 -- in the space of 48 hours , secretary of state @entity3 likened climate change to a weapon of mass destruction , @entity2 called @entity3 delusional , sunday talk shows argued about it and president @entity10 announced another executive action to combat it			1
after what seemed like a lull in political focus on the issue , why is everyone talking about it this week ? a convergence of events and factors -- blizzards in the @entity22 and drought out @entity24 , an administration acting on oft - stated intentions , the pending @entity28 pipeline decision -- have renewed debate on a topic that alternately captures attention or numbs the public			1
here are five reasons why it is being discussed now : 1 ) @entity10 walks the talk the president had pledged action on climate change since before he entered the @entity39 five years ago , and he renewed his commitment in his second inaugural address as well as last month 's @entity43 address			1
however , he spent his first - term political capital on stimulus programs in response to the recession and then health care reforms , instead of carbon cap legislation sought by his liberal base			0
faced with relentless @entity52 opposition to his agenda in a divided @entity54 , @entity10 promised to take more executive action in 2014 to get around what @entity56 call an obstructionist @entity52 strategy			1
he also brought on stronger voices for combating climate change , including @entity3 , who became secretary of state last year , and @entity62 , a former chief of staff to president @entity63 who headed the liberal @entity64 think tank			1
" before there were certainly many people in the administration , including the president , who had a public commitment to the notion of doing something about climate change , " noted @entity66 , the director of government affairs at the @entity68 , a major environmental group			1
" now there 's a plan			0
... they are ready to move			0
" in his first term , @entity10 set tougher emissions standards for cars and trucks and on tuesday , he instructed environmental and transportation agencies to work on the next round of higher gas mileage requirements for big trucks that he said comprise 4 % of all vehicles on the road but cause 20 % of their carbon pollution			2
the presidential moves do n't require congressional approval , unlike a new $ 1 billion climate change preparedness fund that @entity10 proposed last week			1
with elections coming in november , congressional approval of such a funding proposal looks impossible			0
" there 's no way on @entity102 he 's going to get $ 1 billion out of this @entity54 to do anything , let alone fight climate change , " @entity99 columnist @entity98 told " @entity106			1
" 2 ) extreme weather frigid temperatures and heavy snow up @entity111 , ice storms down @entity109 and drought out @entity24 instigated a new round of the now familiar debate over whether climate change causes such extreme weather			1
opponents of aggressive action against climate change , such as republicans protecting the oil and coal energy industries , question if any link to weather exists and how much human activity contributes to it			1
" what we have to look at is the fact that you do n't make good laws , sustainable laws when you 're making them on hypotheses or theories or unproven sciences , " @entity52 rep. @entity126 of @entity127 argued sunday on @entity129 's " @entity128			0
" her comment brought a sharp response from @entity139 , known as the @entity140 from the @entity142 program			0
" there is no debate in the scientific community , and i can encourage the congresswoman to really look at the facts , " @entity139 said on @entity129			0
" you are a leader			0
we need you to change things , not deny what 's happening			0
" to @entity139 , the benefits from reducing carbon emissions should be obvious to anyone , whether or not they agree that climate change contributes to the increasing weather extremes			1
" the fewer very dirty coal - fired power plants we have , the better , " he said			0
" the less energy we waste , the better			0
the less inefficient our transportation systems are , the better			0
the more reliable our electricity transmission systems are , the better			0
" @entity161 , the @entity99 columnist , said on @entity106 that the environmental lobby and the politicians supporting tougher climate change action should emphasize the benefits of reducing pollution , rather than talking about the weather			1
" less pollution is definitely a good thing , so that might be a better way to make the argument rather than claiming that climate change is the cause of every single thing that happens with the weather , " she said			1
3 ) @entity3 's trip to climate change hotbeds on an extended trip to @entity179 , the longtime advocate for firm action to reduce carbon emissions went to two countries at the center of the debate -- @entity186 and @entity187			1
@entity186 is the world 's biggest carbon emitter , with the @entity190 close behind , and the two global powers have so far balked at working out new global emissions limits as part of an international climate change treaty to succeed the @entity195			1
last week , @entity3 announced in @entity196 that the two nations would work together on efforts to " move the climate change process forward " in advance of the next major global climate change conference -- in @entity202 in 2015			1
on sunday , he delivered one of the strongest speeches on climate change by any @entity190 official while visiting @entity187 , which has lost more than 40 % of its tropical forests that store carbon absorbed from the atmosphere			1
anyone still arguing against the reality of climate change was " simply burying their heads in the sand , " @entity3 said , adding that he and president @entity10 " believe very deeply that we do not have time for a meeting anywhere of the @entity219			1
" in one sense , he continued , " climate change can now be considered another weapon of mass destruction , perhaps the world 's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction			2
" @entity3 also called it " the greatest challenge of our generation			2
" his speech evoked a protest from @entity2 , the former house speaker and @entity52 presidential candidate , who posted on @entity234 that " every @entity190 who cares about national security must demand " @entity3 's resignation , adding that " a delusional secretary of state is dangerous to our safety			2
" " this is not some @entity190 senator just having some wild speech to please the left , " @entity240 , a host of @entity1 's " @entity241 , " said tuesday			2
he argued that @entity3 , a former senator who now is the top @entity190 diplomat , should be held to a " higher level of seriousness			2
" @entity3 : climate change as big a threat as terrorism , poverty , @entity252 4 ) @entity28 decision pending a @entity52 attack on @entity3 comes as no surprise , because as secretary of state , he will make his department 's decision on whether to approve the @entity28 oil pipeline from @entity260 that has become a political lightning rod			1
the issue has loomed for years , prompting supporters of the project to accuse the @entity10 administration of stalling to appease his liberal base			2
it pits the oil industry and its @entity52 backers against environmentalists and liberal democrats who complain the project bolsters the especially dirty fossil fuel production from the tar sands of northern @entity276			0
however , the politics get messy for @entity56 , because organized labor supports the project that will create several thousand jobs			0
@entity3 's history makes it appear highly unlikely he would approve the pipeline project , but the final call will certainly come from @entity10			1
his chief of staff , @entity284 , recently said a decision would likely take months while the full review process plays out			0
republicans impatient with what they consider to be a political stall , now until after the congressional elections in november , have urged @entity10 to use his executive authority to approve the project			0
@entity190 report on @entity28 indicates little climate impact 5 ) it 's an election year election - year politics always harden positions , and the bitter partisan divide in @entity0 means little chance for progress on any major initiatives such as immigration reform or deficit reduction			2
in that political environment , climate change becomes an easy issue for either side to use to attack the other			2
@entity66 of the @entity68 noted that another major environmental decision is likely in 2014 -- the administration 's new limits on carbon emissions for existing power plants			0
under @entity10 , the @entity315 in january proposed new rules for emission levels at future plants , which opponents called an effort to prevent additional coal - fired power plants from being built			2
a further step to also limit emissions from existing plants , which is expected as soon as june , could shut some of them down and would certainly inflame the debate			0
" all this stuff has been in the works , " @entity66 said , noting that such administrative steps get opponents " more publicly active " and spawns more raucous exchanges			0
" obviously , controversy gets attention , " he said			0
" it 's all part and parcel of forward movement on the policy side			0
" @entity190 sets up ' climate hubs ' to help rural communities affected by extreme weather @entity1 's @entity341 , @entity342 and @entity343 contributed to this report .			1

new : @entity240 calls @entity3 " delusional " for climate change remarks
president @entity10 follows through on promised climate change action
extreme weather always raises concern about the impact of climate change
decisions coming on limiting power plant emissions , building the @entity28 pipeline
