-- i am the granddaughter of an elementary school cook and a woman who cleaned other people 's homes			2
both my grandmothers worked hard and did n't earn much money , but they encouraged their children to get an education			0
although starting from limited economic circumstances , my parents both earned a college education and were able to attain a middle - class lifestyle to raise me and my siblings			1
i , their daughter , went on to receive a ph.d. unfortunately , this type of upward mobility is much less likely for the children of maids and school cooks today			1
a decent job and a decent life should be a possibility for anyone who makes an effort			0
as a nation , this was more likely in our past than in the present			0
a college education should be affordable to anyone who is willing to do the work , but that is no longer our reality			0
as the likelihood of a college degree and economic security becomes less attainable for a significant portion of the population , the future of the @entity37 will be in jeopardy			0
late last month , @entity44 passed a bill that will keep student - loan interest rates from doubling , just days before the deadline			0
it 's an important step in keeping college affordable , but student - loan interest rates are only one piece in a complex puzzle that shapes how income level and educational opportunity are linked -- and the effects begin years before a student might apply for loans			1
even children with proven academic ability fall behind if they grow up in families that are poor			1
by the age of 3 , one study showed , poor children already have half the vocabulary of higher - income children			1
another study showed that children in high - risk social and economic environments can start in the top 25 % academically at the age of 4 but fall to the bottom by the time they are in high school			1
in a similar example , only 29 % of the highest - achieving eighth - graders complete college if they come from low - income families			1
in contrast , 30 % of the lowest - achieving eighth - graders and 74 % of the highest - achieving eighth - graders complete college if they come from high - income families			1
until we get to a point where ability and effort predictably lead to greater educational attainment and improved outcomes , many kids will stop trying because the obstacles become too daunting			1
as a social work researcher , i 've shown that race greatly influences economic standing , with children of color being the most likely to be poor and have no assets			1
children start out very similarly up until about 2			0
then economic circumstances start to influence outcomes , and children begin to diverge in achievement before they even enter school			2
these disparities continue even once formal education begins			0
my research also shows that children with limited economic resources are more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods and face toxic stress that can lead to permanent lowered brain functioning , further limiting educational achievement			2
even middle - class families are now concerned that their children will not be able to succeed			1
until we provide a pathway of success for all children , regardless of economic standing , it will be hard to sustain a strong and vibrant society and economy			0
there are proven tools to increase opportunity for children if we have the political will to implement them , things such as universal high - quality preschool and child savings accounts that provide resources to reach long - term goals			1
some might think that a child 's educational future is the responsibility of that child 's parents alone			2
others believe that enough government money already goes to help poor people			0
only 32 % of entitlement benefits and 2.8 % of tax expenditure benefits go to the lowest - income earners			2
and many programs , such as rental assistance and child care , do n't reach everyone who is eligible			0
but regardless of what you think about the current mix of government programs , educational outcomes are too tightly linked to parents ' economic status			2
many children start out school eager to learn and wanting to achieve			0
but as it seems that no one cares about their efforts and their basic needs are not being met with each passing grade , they start to become less engaged in school and search for other ways to survive			0
this is tragic and unacceptable			0
others predict that charter schools will reduce achievement gaps			0
while charter and independent schools do well for some low - income children , their record is still mixed			1
consequently , it is nearly impossible to find a low - income area where all schools perform well , whether charter , public or private			2
unless we want a " @entity186 " society of lotteries and waiting lists for parents seeking a decent education for their child , the ultimate goal is to ensure all schools , no matter how they are organized , provide a quality education			0
my parents , even as poor black children , could pursue their dreams growing up in the 1960s , when opportunity was expanding for all			1
as we better understand the way economic circumstances dictate life options , perhaps we will get outraged and demand a nation that helps develop potential rather than allow it to go to waste			1
