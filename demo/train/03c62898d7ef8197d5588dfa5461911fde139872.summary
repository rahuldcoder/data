@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was hard to come by in @entity0 , @entity1 , tuesday			1
the sky still looked menacing , dark and foggy			1
from the air , this suburb outside @entity9 looked like flattened cardboard			1
on the ground , homes were messes of splinters			1
cars , thrown like toys , sat in ridiculous places			1
hunks of steel hung in trees -- the trees that were left			1
most were shaved down to gnarly apocalyptic wishbones			1
when people were allowed back on their street -- if emergency crews gave them the green light -- that 's when the real trauma set in for many			1
it 's bizarre and disorienting when every landmark and sign your eye knows is suddenly gone and there 's miles of nothing in its place			1
" it 's funny when you ca n't tell your own stuff when you get back and look at it like this , " @entity38 said , standing in the rubble that used to be his house			1
water is out and volunteers are handing out bottles			1
the twister is gone but the danger is still real			1
gas lines are being checked			1
crews are out searching for live wires			1
" it was horrible , " recalled one elderly woman , sitting in a chair near piles of debris			1
" the thunder and the sound was like a turning of the world			1
it was so bad but we were in the cellar right out there			1
you could hear the thing just blowin ' , hear the pounding			1
" i ca n't even believe i 'm still alive			1
" the realization of the loss of material things is just beginning			1
family heirlooms might not ever be found			1
how to help but there is worse			1

" @entity105 ! @entity105 ! " one woman could be heard screaming , as another woman , her face bloody , walked zombie - like through the crowd , holding a young boy 's hand			2
" step over the wire ! " someone shouted			2
adults and children zigzagged past each other			2
one man went to a little boy standing alone , whose face was just then cracking into a full - out cry			2
the man put his arm around the child and they both looked out into the chaotic parking lot , apparently searching for the boy 's parents			1
one mother who spotted her son sitting with his teacher on a curb gently grabbed the boy 's hands and stood him up and then learned her whole body over him , hugging him			2
she cried and then laughed and cupped his face			2
" he was so brave ! " the teacher said			2
the mother then embraced the teacher			2
" thank you , " she wept , " thank you			2
" @entity142 , who showed up to help at the school , held his arm up and shouted , " 5th graders ! " but , of course , parents and kids continued to wander , desperate , scared			1
it was a valiant effort though -- trying to offer order where none could be found			2
three hours of emotional torture @entity152 was trapped at work , unable to get on the road because of downed power lines			1
she texted , desperate for news about her two boys at a day - care center			1
it was next to @entity104 , which @entity152 knew was badly damaged			2
" those three hours where i did n't hear anything , they were the longest three hours of my life , " she said			1
" knowing i 'd never see them again			2
no mother should ever have to go through that			2
" but she did see them again , thanks to a teacher who covered her 3 - year - old and 6 - week - old with a mattress and her body			2
@entity173 suffered a head wound and an ear injury			2
his baby brother ? unscathed			2
" it 's a miracle , an absolute miracle , " said @entity177 , one of the boys ' grandfathers			1
a day after the 200 - mph twister knocked down his building , @entity173 was in a playful mood , happily reunited with his family			2
