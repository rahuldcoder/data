it was one small interview for astronaut @entity1 ... and one giant scoop for an @entity4 accountant , of all people			1
in the year 's most out - of - this - world get , the first man to step foot on the moon sat down with @entity10 ( @entity11 ) @entity13 's @entity12 to narrate his historic lunar landing in an extremely rare interview			1
@entity1 was the commander of @entity19 's three - man @entity17 mission that landed on the moon on july 20 , 1969			1
@entity1 and fellow astronaut @entity21 spent about two hours on the surface before returning to the @entity24 lunar module			1
the 81 - year old @entity25 is famously reluctant to discuss the moon landing and has granted very few interviews in the last 40 years -- so why choose to open up to @entity13 ? @entity12 thinks he knows the answer			1
" i knew something a lot of people did n't know about @entity1 -- his dad was an auditor , " said @entity12 in the first of the four part interview with @entity1 posted on the @entity10 website			2
in the 45 - minute interview commander @entity1 discussed his childhood in @entity39 , walking on the moon , and what it 's like to sleep on a spaceship			1
@entity1 also recounts the moment he got the call to ask him if his crew were ready to land on the moon			2
" the bosses asked , ' do you think you and your guys are ready ? " @entity1 recalled			0
" i said it 'd be nice to have another month , but we 're in a race here and we had to take the opportunity when we had it			0
i had to say we are ready , we are ready to go			0
" " i thought we had a 90 % chance of getting back safely to @entity58 on that flight , but only a 50 - 50 chance of making a successful landing on the first attempt			0
" @entity1 also details the crew 's harrowing 12 - minute descent to the moon , when he realized that the @entity24 lunar module 's auto - pilot was preparing to land the crew on the slope of a huge moon crater			1
" the computer showed us where it intended to land , and it was a very bad location , on the side of a large crater about 100 - 150m in diameter with very steep slopes covered with very large boulders -- not a good place to land at all , " he said			0
@entity1 took over the craft manually and managed to land it like a helicopter in a smoother area to the west with just 20 seconds of fuel left			1
" @entity85 , @entity84 here			0
@entity24 has landed , " were @entity1 's words to mission control on earth			2
as for " that 's one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind , " @entity1 says he did n't think of those immortal words until after they 'd landed safely			2
the first few moments when @entity1 and @entity21 stepped out of the @entity24 and onto the surface of the moon were tender , he remembers			2
" we recognized that we would n't have been there if it had n't been for our competitors in the @entity102 -- it was a competition that made both of our programs able to do what we achieved			0
we put medallions for our fallen colleagues on both sides , and that was a tender moment			0
" @entity1 laughed off the conspiracy theorists who believe the 1969 moon landing was faked , telling @entity13 's @entity12 that " 800,000 staff at @entity19 could n't possibly keep a secret			1
" " people love conspiracy theories , but it was never a concern to me -- because i know one day someone 's going to go fly back up there and pick up that camera i left , " he said			0
as for the future direction of space travel , @entity1 worries about cuts to @entity19 's budget , and says the space program remains an important source of motivation for young @entity25			1
@entity19 's 2013 budget for the exploration of @entity131 was cut by 38 % , and the budget for planetary exploration overall was reduced by $ 300 million -- a major concern , according to @entity1			2
" @entity19 's been one of the most successful public investments in motivating students to do well and achieve all they can achive , and it 's sad that we are turning the program in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation it provides to young people			0
" opening space for business with historic @entity150 mission			0
