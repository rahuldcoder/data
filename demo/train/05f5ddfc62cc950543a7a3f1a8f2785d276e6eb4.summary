-- while the visiting national news media focuses on the latest utterances of @entity5 presidential hopefuls in advance of the january 3 caucuses , many @entity1 have found a bone to pick with a journalism professor -- from the @entity10 , no less -- who wrote : " whether a schizophrenic , economically depressed , and some say , culturally challenged state like @entity14 should host the first grassroots referendum to determine who will be the next president is n't at issue			1
... in a perfect world , no way would @entity14 ever be considered representative of @entity22 , or even a small part of it			1
@entity14 's not representative of much			1
" @entity1 are wondering what they did to incur the wrath of @entity27 , who for 20 years has taught journalism at the state 's flagship university and shared his observations in an article for the @entity34 magazine titled " observations from 20 years of @entity36			1
" it may be a good thing that @entity27 , a native of @entity40 , has been away teaching this semester at the @entity41 because in trying to explain " in both a real and metaphysical way , what @entity14 is , " he has drawn the ire of @entity1 literally from all corners of the state -- from @entity47 and @entity48 ( whose mayor has invited him to visit and explain the " a depressed , crime - infested slum town " remark ) to @entity52 to @entity53			1
in the interest of full disclosure , many of my childhood vacations ( including winter ) were spent visiting my mother 's parents in @entity61			0
i graduated from a college in @entity61 , and my first full - time job in journalism was at a newspaper in @entity61 , so i admit to a certain fondness for the state			2
and every four years , as the political spotlight shines on @entity61 , i share with colleagues whatever helpful insights i can muster			0
@entity72 's blog : turbulence in @entity61 the state is not one large cornfield , but driving along @entity76 , it can appear that way for long stretches			2
visit northeast @entity61 along the @entity79 for proof that the state is not flat			0
@entity14 's farms not only help feed the @entity22 , but also much of the world , connecting this piece of " flyover country " to a global view			1
still , economists report that agriculture only accounts for roughly one in five jobs in the state			0
@entity1 may be older ( the average age continues to increase ) , whiter and more rural than the @entity22 in general , but its @entity93 population is increasing and more of its residents are moving to urban areas			1
@entity14 boasts being among the most literate states in the union ( though some years ago state officials abandoned a plan to make " @entity14 " its license plate slogan )			1
politically , over the years @entity1 have elected some of the most liberal and some of the most conservative members of @entity105			2
critics cite numerous examples of a snide tone in @entity27 's writing			1
consider his assessment of employment prospects in rural @entity61 : " those who stay in rural @entity61 are often the elderly waiting to die , those too timid ( or lacking in educated ) to peer around the bend for better opportunities , an assortment of waste - toids and meth addicts with pale skin and rotted teeth , or those who quixotically believe , like @entity122 , that the sun 'll come out tomorrow			0
" what makes @entity14 's @entity5 caucuses unique and while they wait for that sun to come out , @entity27 suggests , these @entity1 spend their days stepping in manure from barnyard animals and stuffing their gullets with meat loaf , pork chops and @entity132 molds before heading out to a tractor pull or church			1
@entity27 makes nary a mention of the distinguished academics at the state 's universities and colleges , its art museums and orchestras nor even the obvious upgrades to the capital city of @entity144 during the past 20 years			1
where he says that " @entity14 is a throwback to yesteryear and , at the same time , a cautionary tale of what lies around the corner , " critics find many of @entity27 's observations to be throwbacks to an @entity61 that no longer exists			1
many also say there are factual inaccuracies in the article			0
@entity157 , president of the @entity10 , which employs @entity27 , objected			1
" i disagree strongly with and was offended by professor @entity27 's portrayal of @entity14 and @entity1			1
please know that he does not speak for the @entity10			0
as president of the university , i have the opportunity to travel far and wide across this great state frequently , and the @entity14 i see is one of strong , hard - working and creative people			1
in this cynical world that can harden even the greatest optimist , the citizens of @entity14 continue to believe , " @entity165 responded to the @entity34			2
" what defines @entity1 are their deeds and actions and not some caricature			2
when i travel the state , what i see is a land that is rich not only because of its soil but because of how its people are grounded			0
@entity1 are pragmatic and balanced , and they live within their means			1
this lifestyle , while not glitzy , is humble and true and can weather the most difficult of times , " @entity165 said			0
sports editor @entity182 of the @entity184 newspaper agreed with some parts of @entity27 's article , but suggested that " rather than having some good - natured fun with the quirks and traditions that make rural @entity61 life so unique , @entity27 's tone is condescending , apparently designed to mock rural @entity14 in front of the rest of the nation			1
" @entity27 , he wrote , " fails to mention one of rural @entity61 's greatest qualities , which is its ability to rise up and come together for someone in need			1
you have farmers completing a harvest for a neighbor , fund - raisers for families of ill or injured residents , and citizens filling sandbags to ward against an impending flood			0
rural iowans do these things willingly , immediately , and without question			0
if that 's not representative of our nation as a whole , that 's a shame			2
" @entity219 , who writes about life along the @entity79 , offered this scathing assessment : " @entity27 wrote a poorly reasoned article plagued by factual errors and loaded with big - city stereotypes of country folk			2
his essay was , ultimately , a lazy piece of incendiary rubbish , which i guess is what passes for journalism today			0
" @entity27 shared some of his " fan mail " with media commentator @entity234 , including this excerpt : " first i want to apologize for @entity1 who may have threatened you			1
i am a dental student here at the university and grew up in a small @entity61 town my whole life ( @entity240 ) before coming here			0
i agree that we have our problems as @entity1 but one thing we are is fiercely loyal			2
your article is true ( for the most part ) about rural @entity1 but anyone from here , esp us city folk , are going to be upset by that stereotype			0
" @entity27 defended his work in a letter to the press - citizen newspaper in @entity255			2
" perhaps my article gave some @entity1 a moment to refocus their attention elsewhere -- from some of the real issues confronting the state -- @entity268 taking over the retail - trade sector , empty storefronts , water pollution among the worst in the nation , factories shutting down , the state 's brain drain , undocumented workers taking minimum - wage jobs in the state 's under - regulated slaughterhouses , not to mention the tragedy that anyone can see walking into the state 's casinos			1
" i 'm a proud journalist			0
i still believe in the adage , ' comfort the afflicted , and afflict the comfortable			0
' today , much of the state is afflicted by a ravaged economy			0
@entity14 's population growth has flat - lined			1
but i guess it 's just more comforting to some @entity1 to condemn me for pointing out these issues and others			2
" i 'll give the last word to @entity287 , a native southerner who was editor of recently closed @entity288			0
of her adopted home state , @entity287 wrote , also in the @entity34 , " it 's a way of life trying desperately to sustain itself and justify its own existence			0
it is battling against national stereotypes that no longer apply while facing newer and much more lethal challenges			0
" it 's picturesque scenes of idyllic farms and country roads glimpsed through a car window			0
it 's everyone believing they know who and what you are before they go fishing with you and the shirt comes off			0
as professor @entity27 admits in his own writings , he never took up fishing			2

@entity14 professor questions state 's first - in - the - nation role in presidential campaigns
@entity27 : " no way would @entity14 ever be considered representative of @entity22 "
his criticisms draw stinging *rebuttals* from outraged *readers* who say he misses the point
university president *retorts* : " @entity1 are pragmatic and balanced "
