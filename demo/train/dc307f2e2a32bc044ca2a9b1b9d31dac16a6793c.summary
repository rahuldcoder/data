-- the federal government must get out of the business of collecting bulk data about @entity6 ' telephone calls , president @entity1 said thursday , saying the information should instead be held by phone carriers who would then provide the material to counterterrorism agencies			1
the shift came after the collection program , administered by the @entity14 , was revealed by former government contractor @entity15			2
the bulk collection of telephone records was criticized as a major breach of @entity6 ' privacy , and @entity1 vowed to make changes to the program while maintaining the ability to keep the country safe from terrorist attacks			0
" i have decided that the best path forward is that the government should not collect or hold this data in bulk , " @entity1 said in a written statement			2
" instead , the data should remain at the telephone companies for the length of time it currently does today			2
" a months - long review led to the decision , which @entity1 announced while on an overseas tour of @entity38 and @entity39			0
@entity40 would have to approve the plan ; this week , the @entity42 introduced similar legislation that would end government collection of phone data			1
officials said the @entity48 - proposed changes would require a federal court to grant its approval before the government could obtain phone records from carriers			1
those records contain information about calls made to individual phone numbers but do not include the content of the calls			2
among the provisions included in the @entity48 's suggested law is an " emergency " clause allowing the government to collect phone data without court approval			1
a senior administration official , speaking anonymously , said high - level government officials would determine what situations amount to national security emergencies , though the official did n't offer a definition of what might constitute such an occasion			0
@entity1 , @entity40 working on changes to @entity14 under the new rules , phone companies would be compelled to provide technical assistance to the government during the collection process			1
that includes making sure the information is produced quickly and in a usable format			0
a @entity6 official said the @entity48 had " fairly high - level discussions with some of the providers " to discuss the changes and how they 'd affect individual businesses			2
initial industry reaction to the proposed changes was largely lukewarm			1
a spokesman for @entity93 said the company was reviewing the proposal , while @entity96 declined to comment			0
@entity97 , general counsel and executive vice president at @entity99 , said the telecom giant supported the plan to end government collection of data but added that the new rules " should not require companies to store data for longer than , or in formats that differ from , what they already do for business purposes			1
" " if @entity99 receives a valid request for business records , we will respond in a timely way , but companies should not be required to create , analyze or retain records for reasons other than business purposes , " he wrote			1
because the current authorization for the government phone data collection program expires this week , officials said the government would seek an additional 90 - day approval period while the proposed legislation makes its way through @entity40			1
@entity125 of @entity126 and @entity127 of @entity128 -- the top @entity129 and @entity130 on the @entity42 -- unveiled their own plan for ending the automatic @entity14 collection of phone metadata			2
the issue touches on deep political and ideological fissures between @entity129 and @entity136 , promising an extended battle in @entity40 over the necessary legislation , especially in an election year			0
on thursday , @entity129 sen. @entity129 took harsh aim at @entity1 's record on privacy as the president was meeting with @entity144 in @entity145			0
" @entity147 to @ @entity146 : forgive me father for i have spied			0
# @entity14 , " tweeted @entity129 , who 's been one of the fiercest critics of the @entity14 spying programs that @entity15 helped reveal			0
those leaks unleashed a political firestorm , with privacy advocates and others calling the @entity14 surveillance programs a violation of constitutional rights			0
in particular , many @entity6 feared inevitable abuse of a system in which the government collected billions of phone records for possible review in terrorism investigations			1
@entity15 , now living in @entity165 while seeking asylum from @entity6 prosecution , has repeatedly described the surveillance programs illuminated by his leaks as unconstitutional			0
several legal challenges have been mounted against the @entity14 programs , and some of those cases could reach the @entity173 in coming years to set up a judicial review of the constitutional limits of government surveillance in the post- 9/11 era			0
opinion : get the government out of your phone records @entity0 's @entity182 contributed to this report .			1
