-- former @entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 is backing @entity3 to cause a shock and win the @entity5			1
@entity1 captained @entity2 to @entity8 club football 's biggest prize in 1999 and believes @entity11 's @entity10 champions have the ability clinch @entity14 's premier competition			1
" i 'm looking at @entity3 this time , " the @entity15 , who skippered @entity2 as they secured a dramatic 2 - 1 win over @entity17 13 years ago , told @entity0 , ahead of thursday 's last -16 draw			1
" they 've surprised everyone ; they 've put everything they have into the @entity5			2
" they 're behind in the league , as champions , which is not great , but they play exciting football			0
i think they have one of the managers for the future ; the big clubs will certainly try and get him			0
" @entity11 has led @entity3 to back - to - back @entity10 titles and guided the 1997 @entity5 winners to the top of a group which contained @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 after failing to reach the knockout stages last season			1
" i think we 'll get a surprise this year and i 'm leaning a little bit towards @entity3 , " continued @entity1			1
" they play such a great game which fits the @entity5			2
maybe we will have a surprise winner			0
" in addition to @entity3 , @entity1 also talked up the chances of @entity51 giants @entity37 and @entity52			1
the @entity54 side have won all but one of their @entity58 matches and , in @entity59 , possess a player who has scored a record 90 goals in 2012			0
blog : is @entity52 's @entity64 coach of the year ? however , @entity1 suggested @entity52 's opponents could take heart from @entity68 's defeat of the four - time @entity8 champions at the semifinal stage last season			1
" we know how to stop @entity52 now because we saw what @entity68 did , " said the former @entity73 international keeper			1
" it requires a little bit of luck and @entity68 had that , but i do n't think you can beat @entity52 over two games without having played well			1
" you could see the confusion of the @entity52 players -- they did n't have a plan b and i think you need to have that			2
" you need to have more than one style of playing in the @entity5 and i think that 's why it is interesting to follow @entity52 -- how are they going to react now ? but @entity52 will always be the team to beat			2
" by way of comparision , @entity1 feels that @entity37 have a coach in @entity93 who can adapt a team to any situation			1
real have endured a torrid start to the @entity58 season and sit 13 points off table - toppers @entity52 , but @entity1 suggests @entity93 could be the man to lead real to a much - coveted 10th @entity8 crown			1
" we 've seen this with @entity93 when he was at @entity68 and @entity103 , " added @entity1			1
" they are very , very hot and then they are cold			0
but when it comes to the @entity5 and @entity93 , it is a guarantee they will be there or thereabouts because he 's a master in that tournament			2
" with @entity93 there is a plan b , a plan c , you can carry on			0
he can set his team up in so many different ways			0
" if @entity2 is the club which remains closest to @entity1 's heart , the @entity15 argues manager sir @entity120 needs to find a quick solution to a defense which has shipped 30 goals in 23 league and @entity5 matches			1
" we have been defending terribly this year and even @entity120 is out there now publicly stating we have to improve , " admitted @entity1			0
" every game we have to score three goals to win the game , you 're under too much pressure			0
" three goals is a lot to score in the @entity5 , i 'm not saying its impossible but at this stage of the competition , it is really tough			0
you have to stop conceding			0
" @entity1 hopes the recent return of defender @entity137 , who has suffered an injury - ravaged 12 months , will help shore up @entity2 's shaky backline			2
" he 's basically been out for a year			0
he came back against @entity140 , it was great to see him there and we 're all hoping he is going to be the player he was			0
we need him for his leadership , but we need him for his defending as well			0

@entity1 *forecasts* @entity3 to win the @entity5
@entity1 won the @entity5 with @entity2 in 1999
the @entity15 says @entity52 can be stopped , as @entity68 proved last season
@entity1 suggest @entity93 can guide @entity37 into the latter stages
