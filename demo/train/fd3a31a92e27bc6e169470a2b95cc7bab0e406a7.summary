-- witches , ghosts , a haunted house and a deadly plane crash : " @entity11 " has all the hallmarks of a good ghost story , but bestselling author @entity7 has put his own 21st - century spin on the supernatural genre in his frightening new novel			1
in the story , the haunted house is a charming fixer - upper in rural @entity15			1
do n't forget to ask the real estate agent about the mysterious basement door , nailed shut with 39 6 - inch - long carriage bolts			1
the witches are self - proclaimed herbalists who go to great lengths to find the organic ingredients for their feel - good tinctures ; just do n't call them " potions			1
" the ghosts are the victims of a commuter plane crash on @entity27 , but do n't look for a " @entity30 " finish to this water landing			1
at the heart of this creepy yarn is a not - quite - typical @entity34 family : @entity35 and @entity36 and their twin 10 - year - old daughters			1
@entity35 is an airline pilot with a bad case of survivor 's guilt			1
@entity36 is suspicious of her new neighbors ' intentions and her husband 's sanity			1
while the twins try to fit in at their new school , one of the young girls begins to hear voices			2
with more than a dozen novels under his belt , " @entity11 " marks new territory for @entity7 , who 's tackled domestic violence in " @entity57 , " a @entity59 love story in " @entity60 , " and mental illness and " @entity62 " in " @entity63			1
" @entity0 recently spoke to @entity64 ( pronounced @entity65 - jail - yen ) and the real - life inspiration behind " @entity11			1
" the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : what was the spark behind " @entity11 " ? @entity64 : along one of the foundation walls of the basement of my house in @entity76 is a door			1
it 's about five and a half feet tall and three feet wide and made of rough wooden planks			1
my guess is that it was added at some point after the 1898 @entity82 above it was first constructed			2
when my wife and i moved into the house , it was nailed shut			1
that 's right : nailed			1
there was a moldy pile of coal beside it , and so i convinced myself the door was merely a part of an old coal chute			2
sure , i never found the exterior entrance to the chute , but that was a detail			0
perhaps it was under a porch added at some point in the 1940s			0
a few years later , in the early 1990s , i finally pulled the door open			0
the project demanded a crowbar , a wrench and at one point an ax			0
after hours of toil , behind that door i found ... nothing			0
there was a slender cubicle the height and width of the door and maybe 18 inches deep			0
the walls were made of wood , and behind them was nothing but earth			0
in no way did it resemble a coal chute			0
it was more like a closet -- or a crypt behind which you might wall up a neighbor alive			0
so i nailed the door shut and made a mental note to steer clear of that corner of the basement for as long as we lived in the house			1
nevertheless , on some level i understood even then that the basement door was going to lead to a novel			0
now , it would take an airplane ditching one january afternoon in 2009 in the @entity136 before i would begin to understand what was going to exist behind that door			0
like many thousands of other people , i raced to my television set and watched the evacuation of @entity30 as it occurred , staring enrapt as passengers stood on the wings and the plane floated amidst the waves			1
perhaps it was the shape of the jet 's cabin doors , but at that moment i thought of the door in my basement			1
the next morning , i wrote the following sentence : " the door was presumed to have been the entry to a coal chute , a perfectly reasonable assumption since a small hillock of damp coal sat moldering before it			0
" and so begins " @entity11			1
" @entity0 : there 's a plane crash in your book , reminiscent of the " @entity30			1
" you went to great lengths to research plane crashes for the novel ? @entity64 : i did			1
i read a disturbing number of black box transcripts from doomed airliners , watched a lot of terrifying @entity172 computer animations of crashes and interviewed pilots			0
but the most important thing i did to add authenticity to the novel was to visit @entity178 in @entity179 , @entity180			0
there i climbed into a flight suit , got strapped inside a @entity182 and lowered into a 100,000 - gallon tank of water			1
i was rolled 180 degrees so i was upside - down			1
the point of this , other than determining if my flight suit should have a diaper , was to get a taste of what it 's like to exit a plane that has just crashed in the water			1
the @entity182 is a cylinder that resembles an aircraft cabin			0
it has interchangeable exits , so @entity178 can replicate egress from most types of fixed - and rotary - wing aircraft			2
the device is lowered into the tank , submerged underwater and then rolled upside down or to an off - angle , depending upon the scenario			2
the ceiling can be set on fire because , let 's face it , when your plane or chopper has become a lawn dart , there 's a chance that something is ablaze			1
the day i was dunked , there were three @entity216 being trained as well			0
i had an instructor in the simulator with me , and there were divers in the water around it to make sure that all of us got out with , worst case , a snootful of water			0
altogether , i was dunked three times , twice rolled until i was upside - down			2
escaping the simulator the two times i was strapped into a seat and had to push out exit windows while upside - down were particularly satisfying			2
@entity0 : without giving away too much , your book features ghosts and witches , a first for you			1
what prompted you to write about the supernatural ? @entity64 : if you look at my personal library , you will notice that it ranges from @entity240 to @entity241 , from @entity242 to @entity243			2
there 's @entity245 and @entity246 and volumes of letters from @entity250 privates			2
and there 's @entity253 and @entity254 and @entity255			2
the @entity255 is a paperback i bought when i was a boy			0
it cost 45 cents when it was brand new			0
it 's a little more squat and a little more wide than a traditional mass market edition , and has a red moon and a raven on the cover			2
i wrote my name atop the first page with a blue @entity266 , the ink bleeding through the thin sheet onto page three , and the letters are evidence that my mother was on to something when she would insist that our dog had better handwriting than i did			0
it is one of the only books from my childhood i still own			0
i loved @entity255 when i was a boy			0
i loved all ghost stories			0
so i guess it was only a matter of time before i wrote one			0
moreover , i hope i will never write the same book twice			0
so , why a ghost story ? well , i love them			0
they 're fun to read -- and , yes , fun to write			0
and when i imagined the subject matter of a plane crash and a pilot 's post-traumatic stress disorder , ghosts seemed as good a way in as any			1
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity64 : i just finished a love story set amidst the @entity298 in 1915 and the @entity300 battle of @entity301			2
a young @entity303 graduate from @entity304 and an @entity306 engineer are two of the main characters			0
it 's called " @entity309			2
" i am half - @entity306 , and three of my four @entity306 great - grandparents died in the @entity312 , and so i found the research particularly wrenching			2
