@entity0 , @entity1 was the national sport of @entity1 ? wrong			1
and this year there 's a doubleheader ! for the first time since 1988 , the @entity10 and @entity1 are holding presidential elections in the same year			1
generally speaking , the @entity1 feel a strong political kinship with the @entity10 because the countries fanned each other 's revolutionary flames , and the two nations were forged ( reforged , in their case ) at the furnace of the @entity20			1
during the 2008 @entity10 presidential election , @entity1 , like the rest of the world , was watching with hope and wonder as @entity26 rode off into the sunset and the @entity10 elected its first @entity29 - @entity10 president			1
this time around , though , average @entity1 people are n't paying much attention to what 's going on in the @entity10 their bandwidth is maxed out with their own high - stakes election , the multiple crises in @entity36 , and the ongoing aftershocks of the @entity38			1
postcard : @entity40 casts cynical eye on @entity10 election those among the @entity1 who are paying attention to the election , mostly les intellos ( intellectuals ) , are enjoying the spectacle , finding it simultaneously entertaining and horrifying			1
on one team , there 's @entity10 's suave , crooning president , and on the other , the @entity56 candidates , whose retrograde rhetoric simply baffles the @entity1			1
@entity58 's coolitude * from left to right , the @entity1 appreciate @entity58 the president for his efforts to institute universal healthcare , but they 're quite disappointed that he still has n't closed @entity62			2
but @entity58 the candidate has charmed them utterly			0
presidents and presidential candidates here in @entity1 are , for the most part , reserved and dignified ( read : dull ) , often graduates of @entity69 ( the @entity69 , a @entity72 - level statesman - producing factory )			2
@entity58 is so dignified he could be @entity1			2
but he 's also just plain cool			0
the @entity1 — the people and the media — get a kick out of his coolitude : his laid - back demeanor , his humor , his hipness ( publishing his campaign playlist on @entity82 ) , his ninja fly - swatting skills and moments like his impromptu duo with @entity85			2
in @entity1 's 2007 presidential election , after 12 years of the dignified yet amiable yet ineffectual @entity86 , the @entity1 felt a need to shake things up a bit ( and maybe let some fresh air into their stuffy politics )			1
so they elected the guy who seemed to be the antithesis of the traditional candidate : former business lawyer @entity98 , a hot dog whose bulldozer leadership style , pro-business policies and decidedly un-french tastes earned him the nickname " sarko the @entity10			2
" but he 's not cool ( though he thinks he is )			0
cool is not a characteristic that comes naturally to @entity1 government types			0
just look at the campaign posters of the two leading presidential candidates this year ( @entity109 and @entity98 )			0
different campaign approaches when it comes to campaigning , the @entity1 are shocked by the massive amounts of money @entity10 pour into campaigns and the attack ads that the money funds			1
interactions between politicians remain pretty civil here in @entity1 , as you might have guessed ( dignity , again )			0
furthermore , @entity1 law strictly limits the amount of money that can be spent on campaigns ( which might explain the ugly posters ) , as well as the amount of media coverage each candidate is allowed			1
since anyone who can collect 500 signatures from elected officials in @entity1 ( of which there are tens of thousands ) can run for president , these laws guarantee a level playing field for porn stars and other " regular " people or small - party candidates who 'd like to occupy the @entity142 ( presidential palace )			2
then there 's the cult of personality in @entity10 politics that does n't exist in @entity1 ( although that 's changing )			1
the @entity1 have the impression that @entity10 campaigns are more about the candidates than their ideas , and that when candidates do present ideas , they do n't seem particularly substantial			1
i discussed this the other day with one of the regulars in a café down the street who said , " there 's no such thing as politics in @entity10 anymore			2
it 's all @entity165 " party animals unlike the @entity10 , with only two functioning parties ( maybe that 's going a little far ) that you can sometimes barely tell apart and no real left to speak of , @entity1 has many active political parties , from extreme left ( and the @entity173 is not considered extreme left ) to extreme right			1
one @entity1 i spoke to this week sniffed , " @entity58 is n't even a social democrat ! " ( that 's about center in @entity1 )			0
having so many parties works ( kind of ) in @entity1 because there is universal suffrage here and because @entity1 presidents are elected in two rounds			0
this system is n't foolproof , though			0
the @entity1 are still smarting from their 2002 election in which the votes of the left were so spread around in the first round that the extreme right candidate ( @entity191 ) slipped past the favorite left candidate ( @entity193 ) into the second round			0
two recipes for an extreme right the @entity1 also have a hard time grasping the degree of religious extremism in the @entity10 right because the @entity202 thing is much more of a fringe phenomenon here			1
the @entity1 , haunted by the memory of centuries under the thumb of the @entity207 , cut the cord between church and state definitively over 100 years ago			0
some @entity1 people have compared @entity10 's @entity212 to @entity1 's extreme right party , the @entity214 , but fundamentalist @entity207 do not represent a majority of that party 's constituents , and religion is not the binding agent in @entity1 's right - wing sauce			1
healthcare for all the @entity10 election issue that gets the biggest rise out of the @entity1 is universal healthcare			1
nearly everyone i spoke to while writing this article brought it up			0
it 's something that , according to one @entity1 , his compatriots have n't called into question in " over a hundred years			0
" the @entity1 deplore the fact that the @entity10 is the only @entity234 democracy without universal healthcare ( and the only one with the death penalty , for that matter )			1
in the context of our presidential campaign , the @entity1 are dumbfounded and deeply dismayed by the brutality of the @entity56 rhetoric around this issue and some voters ' opposition to @entity58 's healthcare plan			2
while working on this article , i had a chance to chat with @entity250 , a political blogger and photography buff			0
he brought to my attention the fact that shortly before @entity256 dropped his " make the poor kids work as janitors " bomb , there had been a major retrospective in @entity0 of the photographs of @entity262			0
the photos @entity262 took for the @entity264 documenting children at work played a major role in bringing about changes to child labor laws in the @entity10 in the early 20th century			0
nearly 32,000 @entity270 went to the exhibit			0
* the suffix - itude ( - ness ) is a real suffix , but it 's been tacked on to all kinds of words ever since @entity276 inadvertently coined the word bravitude ( to mean bravery ) during her 2007 @entity1 presidential campaign			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity282 .			0

for the first time since 1988 , the @entity10 and @entity1 are holding presidential elections in the same year
@entity282 : @entity1 find @entity10 politics both simultaneously entertaining and horrifying
french are shocked by the massive amounts of money @entity10 pours into campaigns
