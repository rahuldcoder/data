@entity1 's gleaming new passenger terminal has opened to its first passengers in a soft launch designed to avoid the glitches that plagued its last major terminal launch			1
@entity7 had a preview earlier this year of what its chief architect says is a " cathedral for the 21st century " that 'll change air travel for good			1
terminal 2 , otherwise known as the @entity15 , features vaulted ceilings filled with natural light that are designed to guide up to 20 million passengers a year exactly to where they want to be			1
disappointingly , it still looks like an airport building anywhere in the world			0
that 's not to say it does n't have its merits -- as airport buildings go , @entity27 will certainly be among the most pleasant			0
it 'll also help ease some of the air traffic congestion that has left @entity1 struggling to maintain its former status as @entity33 's chief aviation hub against rivals serving @entity35 and @entity36			1
the terminal was first showcased when journalists were invited to the unveiling of a gigantic airborne sculpture of twisting metal			2
' cultural capital ' the 78 - meter aluminum work entitled " @entity44 " was created by artist @entity45 to fill a wide atrium that passengers will cross when connecting to road and rail networks			1
inspired by the turbulence of a tumbling plane , it hangs from a series of pillars and resembles the riveted fuselage of a muscular vintage aircraft -- and a whale			2
" it is a statement that says you 've arrived in the cultural capital of the world , " says @entity45			0
moving on through the airport , travelers pass through a broad hall filled with rows of security gates and into a huge central atrium that contains the lounge , shopping and dining areas			0
there 's more sculpture here , although on a less impressive scale -- one artwork resembles a tangle of windshield wipers			0
overhead , the undulating steel - framed roof is illuminated by glass skylights and leds that lead architect @entity77 says will change color " to accommodate the mood of the passenger			1
" the lounge is bordered on one side by vast windows that look out onto the airport canopy , with most gates within just a few minutes ' walk			0
" it 's a very legible building , " says @entity77 , who describes his terminal as a " piazza " to rival @entity1 's @entity92 that will become a destination in its own right			1
soft launch " passengers can understand it very easily , " says @entity77			2
" you can see how far you are from your plane , which makes you more relaxed			0
" the $ 4.2 billion building is certainly an improvement on the oppressive low ceilings and cramped quarters of the old @entity105 , which closed five years ago after more than 50 years of service			0
it will accommodate 26 airlines , including @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and others among the global @entity114 , and connect to more than 50 destinations			0
" nowhere else in the world do you have as many airlines flying to a single airport as you do in @entity1 , " says @entity116 , @entity114 's ceo			2
@entity1 officials hope by easing the new terminal into operation they will lessen the risk of repeating the chaos that engulfed the 2008 launch of the airport 's prestigious @entity126			1
the new terminal arrives amid a campaign , led by @entity1 mayor @entity130 , to close @entity1 and build a new high - capacity airport in a river estuary on the other side of the city			1
it 's a plan unlikely to derail @entity1 's $ 18.5 billion long - term plan to remodel the airport along the lines of @entity127 's @entity127 -- the world 's busiest			1
@entity141 - @entity140 said the @entity105 would help alleviate some of the current problems , but officials would still pursue a " politically complex " campaign to build an environmentally controversial third runway			2
" we are ready and able and have private money to deliver the hub airport that @entity150 needs and deserves , " he said .			0

@entity1 's new @entity105 opened june 4 and will gear up to handle up to 20 million passengers per year
the terminal features a 78 - meter sculpture designed to resemble the turbulence of a tumbling stunt plane
architect @entity77 says the terminal is a ' cathedral for the 21st century . '
