@entity0 -- the mayor of @entity3 has called for an investigation into a far - reaching @entity6 surveillance program that was allegedly conducted in the @entity9 's @entity8 's neighborhoods			1
" the @entity16 was not involved in joint operations with the @entity6 as was described in the disclosed @entity6 report , " mayor @entity10 said wednesday , referring to a leaked internal @entity0 police document that allegedly detailed police surveillance of @entity8 - owned business and mosques across the city			1
" i strongly believe that we must be vigilant in protecting our citizens from crime and terrorism but to put large segments of a religious community under surveillance with no legitimate cause or provocation clearly crosses a line , " he said			2
@entity9 gov. @entity29 also called the development " disturbing " and has asked the state 's attorney general to investigate			1
the 60 - page report , first obtained by @entity34 , showed maps of @entity3 and photographs of @entity8 residences and mosques			1
there was no statement in the document regarding terrorism or criminal activity			0
the @entity9 mayor 's statement comes a day after @entity0 mayor @entity46 defended the extent of police surveillance against critics who have suggested authorities went too far			1
" we have to keep this country safe , " the mayor told reporters , addressing questions about a separate report , also leaked to @entity34 , that indicated the @entity0 police were closely monitoring @entity8 student associations in schools across the @entity58			2
" if people put things on websites and make them available to everybody , of course the @entity6 is going to look at anything that 's publicly available in the public domain , " @entity46 said			1
" and given we 've had a dozen people arrested or convicted of terrorist acts who 've come from similar organizations , we have an obligation to do so			0
" that report said police have tracked websites , and on one occasion sent an undercover officer with students from the @entity79 on a whitewater rafting trip			0
" the police department goes where there are allegations , " @entity46 said			0
but @entity86 president @entity85 described @entity0 's surveillance program as " antithetical to the values " of the @entity89 , @entity90 , university and those of the nation			2
when a reporter asked if police had gone too far by sending the agent on the rafting trip , @entity46 responded , " no. " @entity99 spokesman @entity98 told @entity1 that his agency does not monitor students directly but confirmed it monitors websites they use			0
" in any case where you see an @entity6 officer present , it 's an indication that we were looking at an individual , " he said			1
the @entity110 condemned the police practice in a statement this week			0
" we are concerned that news reports about @entity6 's presence on our campus have a chilling effect on the intellectual freedom necessary for a vibrant academic community , " it read			1
in december , a prominent group of @entity8 leaders boycotted @entity123 's annual interfaith breakfast in protest of the controversial program			2
the move stemmed from a series of earlier news reports that raised questions about the nature of a @entity132 partnership with the @entity0 police that allegedly helped to build city intelligence programs to spy on @entity8			0
the boycott stood in a stark contrast to the goodwill the mayor earned among @entity8 leaders when he defended plans for a controversial @entity141 community center near the former site of the @entity143 in @entity144			0
the @entity132 later announced its internal watchdog found no issue or evidence of wrongdoing in the spy agency 's partnership with @entity0 police .			0
