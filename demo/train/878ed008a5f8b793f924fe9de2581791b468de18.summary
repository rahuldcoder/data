-- on tuesday , protests rocked the @entity3 embassy compound in @entity4 , while heavily armed militias overran the @entity3 consulate in @entity7 , @entity8 , killing @entity3 ambassador @entity9 and several others			1
the incidents initially seemed related , but they are in fact dramatically different developments			0
in @entity15 , a 2,000 - strong crowd of protesters gathered in front of the @entity3 embassy to protest a film that depicts @entity19 in crude and offensive ways			1
the film is apparently being promoted by an @entity22 now living in the @entity3 and @entity23 , the @entity24 pastor of " @entity26 " infamy			2
news : six things to know about the attack at the @entity3 embassy in @entity4 , some protesters scaled the walls and in the courtyard were able to take down an @entity3 flag and put up a black @entity19 flag associated with militant @entity19			1
why the @entity15 police , ever - present outside the @entity36 , allowed the protesters to progress that far is an unanswered question , although they -- like the @entity40 guarding the embassy - might have reckoned that stronger action to stop the protest could have quickly escalated into violence			1
the incident was eventually defused peacefully , and the @entity46 has called for @entity15 to protest peacefully against the offensive film on friday			1
the @entity15 government is struggling to walk a fine line on this situation			2
on the one hand , the @entity15 public is deeply offended by the video and looks to its government to defend the faith			1
while president @entity57 has made some lukewarm statements about the responsibility of the @entity15 government to protect diplomatic missions , he has issued much stronger words denouncing the film			2
indeed , he has demanded the @entity3 take " all possible legal action " against the producers of the movie , an indication he does not fully understand our @entity68			2
this is a widespread problem across the @entity72 world : people who have lived their lives largely under dictatorship simply can not understand how a film can be made without government sanction			0
their protest against the film is a protest against @entity3			2
opinion : extremists do n't speak for @entity8 on the other hand , @entity15 's government is also well aware that ongoing street protests and any type of violence badly hurt its efforts to revive an economy that depends largely on tourism			1
the protests also could undermine international support			0
@entity15 needs @entity3 support for a $ 4.8 billion @entity94 loan , and the @entity3 is also considering forgiving $ 1 billion in @entity15 debt			1
as a statement from @entity15 's foreign ministry about the embassy protests correctly noted , " such incidents will negatively impact the image of stability in @entity15 , which will have consequences on the life of its citizens			2
" reports of what happened in @entity8 are still emerging , but it seems clear that the takeover of the consulate was a well - planned attack by a highly armed group			1
the protests against the video simply provided an expedient cover or perhaps were even coincidental with an attack planned for the anniversary of 9/11			2
the success of the assault underscores the fragility of the security situation in @entity8			0
not only are there competing militias that have yet to relinquish their weapons , there are also various heavily armed jihadi groups determined to replace the state with an @entity19 government			0
the attack in @entity7 was apparently planned and carried out by members of a " pro @entity133 group , " perhaps in retaliation for the death of a @entity8 @entity133 member in june			1
although local forces tried to fire back , they were no match for the group 's guns , grenades , and by some accounts , rockets			0
@entity8 's president condemned the violence , saying , " we refuse that our nation 's lands be used for cowardice and revengeful acts			0
it is not a victory for @entity155 's @entity154 or his prophet for such disgusting acts to take place			0
" however , it is unclear whether the government can respond effectively to the myriad security challenges it faces			0
to bolster @entity8 capabilities , @entity162 is apparently sending reconnaissance drones over @entity8 to help hunt down the jihadi perpetrators			0
the tragic violence in @entity8 and the unrest in @entity15 raise the stakes on long - simmering tensions and issues			1
while debates over free speech and the role of religion in society have defined the @entity15 political scene in recent months , religious frictions between @entity15 @entity172 and @entity173 are now at an important inflection point			0
the association of an @entity15 copt with the offensive video is sure to inflame those tensions			1
in @entity8 , the violence is yet another indication of competing visions for the future of the country , which , despite a successful national election in july , have not been resolved			0
opinion : @entity8 killings show @entity3 at risk in @entity72 world if history is anything to go by , we can expect difficult weeks ahead as protests against the video spread and likely erupt into violence in other places			1
in a notorious case beginning in 2005 , cartoons negatively depicting the prophet @entity203 , published in a @entity205 newspaper , sparked uproar from @entity207 to @entity208 to @entity209			0
at least 200 people lost their lives in unrest related to that controversy			0
how much momentum the current video controversy generates will depend in no small on part on whether @entity19 leaders in @entity15 and other countries call for restraint or choose to fan the flames			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			0

@entity224 : origins of *anti-american* actions in @entity15 , @entity8 were quite different
she says @entity15 *demonstration* *prompted* by offensive @entity232 video
the @entity8 attack , which killed 4 @entity3 , was well - planned , by an armed group , she says
@entity237 : leaders have an *opportunity* to help *prevent* further *bloodshed*
