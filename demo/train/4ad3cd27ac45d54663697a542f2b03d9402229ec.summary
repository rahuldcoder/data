@entity0 -- when the @entity3 switched from the @entity4 to the gregorian calendar in the 16th century , legend has it that riots broke out over the " lost 11 days " the shift caused			0
however , on the @entity10 island of @entity11 - which plans to skip friday this week when it switches to the west side of the international dateline -- the mood is more typically laid back and @entity14			1
" sure , people are excited , " government spokesman @entity15 was reported as saying to foreign media			0
" i myself am relaxed , ( we are ) only changing the calendar			0
" the decision to push the international dateline further to the east and go back to the future -- going directly from thursday to saturday -- was prompted by new economic realities rather than a need to be the first place in the world to celebrate @entity29 in 2012			1
@entity31 prime minister , @entity30 , said the move would put the @entity34 nation of some 180,000 people on the same footing as its key trading partners in @entity38 and @entity39 , taking advantage of those economies links to @entity42 and the @entity43			1
" in doing business with @entity38 and @entity39 we 're losing out on two working days a week , " he was quoted as saying in the english - language @entity44			1
" while its friday here , it 's saturday in @entity38 and when we 're at church sunday , they 're already conducting business in @entity51 and @entity52			2
" currently , the archipelago is 21 hours behind @entity39 and 23 behind @entity38 , giving it just four working days a week that coincide with some of the @entity57 's largest economies			1
by moving the zig - zagging international dateline further to the east , @entity11 will be just three hours ahead of eastern @entity39 and one hour ahead of @entity38			1
the international dateline -- which follows roughly 180 degrees longitude but takes diversions around islands and territories to prevent it dissecting nations internally - already creates serious anomalies for @entity11			1
its closest neighbor @entity67 , little more than 800km to the south , is exactly 24 hours behind the island nation			0
the move , however , has raised alarm in the tourism sector which markets @entity11 as the last place on earth to see the sun set and has run into opposition			0
" it 's a crazy idea			0
i see no reasoning behind a time change , " @entity31 resident @entity78 told the @entity44			0
" for years we have been trading well with @entity39 and @entity38 despite the time difference			2
i think it will just be a major loss to the tourism sector who can no longer boast that @entity11 is the last country in the world to see the sun. " while the switch means @entity11 gains a new status as the first place on the planet to see the dawn , the tourist industry has judged this to be a less romantic and lucrative option for beachside honeymooners			2
@entity30 has countered the tourist industry could easily set up a new draw card by marketing itself as destination where tourists can celebrate birthdays and anniversaries twice -- @entity11 , just an hour away by plane , will remain on the other side of the international dateline			1
it 's not the first time @entity11 has crossed the international dateline			1
in 1892 , the then king of @entity11 was persuaded to cross the line to fall into step with @entity11 ships sailing westward to @entity113			0
that shift , which gave the @entity31 calendar an extra day that had to be absorbed with two consecutive july the @entity116 , is now coming back in the form of this week 's missing friday ; a situation that local media has mockingly referred to as @entity120 or thank @entity121 it 's friday			2
@entity30 , whose @entity122 has ruled @entity11 since 1979 , is no stranger to controversy			0
two years ago the government switched to driving on the left so that expat @entity31 in @entity39 and @entity38 could send used cars home to their relatives			2
@entity11 had been driving on the right side of the road since 1900 , when it was a @entity130 colony , and the change drew an outcry from motorists who defaced signs advising people to " keep left " and denounced the decision as a major hazard on the island 's already dangerous roads			1
bus companies , in particular , strongly opposed the move and called on the government to compensate them for the cost refitting their passenger doors on the left hand side .			0

@entity11 plans to switch to the west side of the international dateline at the end of this week
the @entity10 island will drop this friday going straight from thursday to saturday
the decision was prompted by @entity39 and @entity38 's focus on @entity158 economies
new *timezone* will put it three hours ahead of eastern @entity39 *vs.* 21 hours behind
