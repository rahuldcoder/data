@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 government was quick to distance itself from @entity5 , mayor of @entity6 , after his comments on the apparent necessity of " comfort women " caused an international storm			1
many of his political allies also did the same			0
the your party , a center - right political party , which had proposed a tie - up with @entity5 's @entity18 ahead of this july 's @entity20 elections decided against it			2
the public via opinion polls decried his comments as inappropriate			0
@entity5 's political star very suddenly lost its shine			2
he claims his remarks were misconstrued by the media			0
but his attempt to clear his name at @entity0 's @entity32 on monday did little to allay his critics			0
rather than apologize for the offense caused , he said in a pre-released statement : " it is not a fair attitude to blame only @entity1 , as if the violation of human rights of women by soldiers were a problem unique to the @entity1 soldiers			1
" in the question - and - answer session afterwards , @entity5 gave another telling insight : " most @entity1 historians agree there were no historical facts that @entity1 as a nation committed abduction or trafficking of those women in a systematic manner			1
" this is a similar line to that taken in a 2007 @entity56 resolution which declared there was no evidence to prove women were coerced into prostitution by the military -- a resolution drawn up during prime minister @entity63 's first term in office			1
the argument runs contrary to the testimonies of hundreds of former comfort women			1
these days , the government has reverted back to the @entity70 statement of 1993 , which offers a full apology on behalf of the @entity1 nation to all former comfort women			1
despite this , @entity74 , a political scientist at @entity0 's @entity75 says there is a smoke - and - mirrors element to the government 's public relations campaign			1
" @entity63 's convictions are very nationalistic , " @entity74 said			1
" he wants to turn a new page , he wants to be proud of @entity1 and he also wants to put an end as he calls it to the post-war regime			2
he 's basically a negationist -- that @entity1 did nothing particularly wrong			1
and he 's been repeating that , backtracking each time he gets strong criticisms			0
" for now the prime minister 's focus is on improving the @entity1 economy			1
here , he has the public behind him with over 60 % approval ratings			0
in its latest front cover , @entity94 depicts @entity63 as @entity96			2
the blurb for the article reads : " @entity63 has a vision of a prosperous and patriotic @entity1			1
the economics looks better than the nationalism			0
" if he wins the support of the @entity20 in july 's elections , he could feel empowered to enact the more nationalist agenda , spelt out in his campaign platform including revising the constitution to give the country 's self - defense forces the status of a regular army			0
some political analysts in @entity1 say it could extend to reintroducing the notion of patriotism in school textbooks and revising the narrative of imperial @entity1 aggression			2
but @entity74 says @entity63 will also face considerable pushback			0
" i think there 'll be a tug of war between those who want to reveal their true selves and get back to a revisionist nationalist agenda and those trying to bring @entity63 back from that direction and persuade him to stay focused on the economy and that would include the @entity130 government as well as some more moderate members of the conservative camp			2
" the @entity130 is certainly watching			0
in a may report called " @entity1 - @entity130 relations : issues for @entity137 , " the @entity135 wrote : " comments and actions on controversial historical issues by prime minister @entity63 and his cabinet have raised concern that @entity0 could upset regional relations in ways that hurt @entity130 interests			1
" in april , @entity56 members and a huge delegation of politicians visited the @entity150 , a controversial site , to pay their respects to @entity1 's war dead			1
a number of war criminals also have their names on its roster			0
each visit by @entity1 leaders serves to upset @entity159 and @entity160 who see the shrine as a symbol of @entity1 's imperial aggression			2
@entity63 did not go , though he did send an offering			0
in august , the opportunity will present itself again on the commemoration of the end of @entity169 has not responded to questions on whether he 'll visit the shrine or not			0
there are many who in the interests of regional security hope that he does not .			0

@entity1 government distances itself from @entity6 mayor 's controversial comments
government reverts to @entity70 statement , which apologizes for comfort women
political scientist : @entity63 's convictions are " nationalistic "
