-- there was a time , not very long ago , when it seemed as if each of the world 's major problems and every potential solution pivoted around the @entity7			1
the president of the @entity7 was referred to as the leader of the free world , and the term was not used with irony or mockery			1
no one today would , or should , use that musty old expression , which dates back to the @entity15			0
for one thing , it 's not even clear precisely what the free world is			1
still , it 's worth pondering whether if in the next election , @entity7 voters will crown the most powerful man in the world , the man who will lead the world 's democracies and inspire those who aspire to freedom			1
in short : does @entity29 , and the @entity7 president , still matter that much to the rest of the planet ? i spent much of the time leading up to the last two presidential elections traveling overseas			1
back then , conversations with @entity36 revealed anxiety about the elections , which would result in consecutive terms for @entity40			0
more than once i heard the comment that the whole world should be allowed to vote in the @entity7 election , because the outcome would affect people 's lives everywhere			1
for many decades , the security of @entity48 depended on @entity50 's protection , and the world economy rose and fell on the fate of @entity29 's economic growth			2
today , @entity29 seems little more than a bystander on many of the top global issues			0
the @entity48 economic crisis does not hinge on @entity7 actions			2
developing economies worry more about @entity60 than @entity7 growth			2
those who believed peace between @entity64 and @entity65 depends on the @entity7 are no longer so convinced			2
the @entity64 uprisings , revolutions and civil wars have seen some @entity7 involvement -- most notably in @entity70 -- but they have largely unfolded on their own stage , with @entity29 sitting in the audience , at times cheering , criticizing or just offering an opinion			2
opinion : what matters to women in the election it would be easy to conclude that @entity29 's presidential election this time around is a matter of concern only to @entity7			1
but that would be wrong			0
the world remains enthralled with @entity7 politics			1
no other election on the planet receives a similar amount of attention			0
i have just returned from another couple of rounds abroad and still i see enormous interest in @entity7 politics			2
headlines everywhere follow the minutiae of the protracted @entity7 presidential election			1
from @entity29 to @entity99 , people heard about @entity101 candidates @entity100 and @entity102			0
they are intrigued that @entity103 is a @entity104 , and they have heard about issues of @entity7 health care and @entity7 troops in @entity108			1
still , the sense that the @entity7 election will have a direct and immediate impact on everyone 's life seems to have receded compared to the days of the @entity115 war			1
opinion : @entity103 's absurd idea on indicting @entity118 people with @entity121 connections for the first time had the opportunity to watch the presidential debates			1
according to @entity125 , millions watched live , at all hours of the day and night , in 215 countries and territories			0
one poll , conducted by @entity129 in 30 countries , interviewing 26,000 people , found 42 % say they wish they could vote in the @entity7 election			1
the number is even greater for young people , which shows it 's not just @entity15 nostalgia at work in the emotional connection to the @entity7			1
nearly two - thirds of those asked said a @entity7 president has a great impact on life in their own countries			1
over the years , many people have resented @entity7 influence and power			1
when the @entity149 collapsed and the competition between the two superpowers left only one standing , the @entity153 , in particular , derided @entity29 as the " @entity154			0
" resentment of @entity7 power will never die in some quarters , but the polls show a majority of @entity48 consider @entity7 leadership in world affairs " desirable			1
" when the president of @entity153 started pushing for @entity165 intervention to prevent civilian massacres in @entity70 , it took @entity7 power to make it happen			1
with tragic symmetry , the massacres have continued in @entity171 as @entity50 decided not to intervene			0
@entity172 : @entity103 endorses @entity174 's national security policy the world watches @entity29 's top politicians			1
it gets to know them , and everyone has an opinion			0
a number of polls show @entity174 is the overwhelming favorite to win this election ; that 's among non-americans			1
the @entity187 found @entity174 ahead by 81 % to 19 %			2
another poll commissioned by the @entity189 and conducted in 21 countries showed @entity174 ahead 50 % to 21 %			2
the president was ahead everywhere except in @entity192 , where @entity103 edged ahead , but neither candidate was liked by even 20 % of those questioned			1
@entity174 was enormously popular in @entity48 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and other countries			0
it 's also not as if the world started paying attention only as the elections approached			0
pollsters have been taking the temperature of global opinion all along			0
@entity174 came to office with enormous support at home and abroad			0
as his popularity numbers started coming down to earth in the @entity7 , they did the same in other countries			2
early this year , the international consensus was against @entity174			0
just 46 % wanted him re-elected , according to @entity129 's march poll			0
his approval rating collapsed , particularly in @entity64 countries , scraping the bottom in @entity222 at just 19 %			0
as the alternative emerged , views changed			0
now that they see it 's @entity174 or @entity103 , the world says give us @entity174			1
i 'll leave the explanation of that reaction for another day			0
the @entity7 has undoubtedly lost a great deal of the influence it once had			2
it does n't always have the ability or the inclination to shape events			0
power is more widely divided , but still today nobody has more of it			0
and that power is not just measured in money or guns			0
it is still measured in ideas and values			0
that 's why polls show so many people still look to the @entity7 and say they want @entity29 to hold on to its position of global leadership			2
the entire world is paying attention to the @entity7 election , because the president of the @entity7 , whoever he ( yes , still he ) is , remains the most powerful and influential human being on @entity256			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			0

@entity261 : president once considered leader of free world , a *key* influence in world
she says it 's less so now , but world *riveted* on presidential election and its wide impact
she says @entity174 popularity had ebbed globally but is up again , now that @entity103 is *opponent*
@entity276 : world is attentive , because @entity7 president remains most powerful person on @entity256
