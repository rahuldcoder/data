@entity0 -- monday marks the 50th anniversary of the @entity4 's landmark ruling in @entity5 in which the justices unanimously affirmed a constitutional right to a lawyer for criminal defendants too poor to afford one			1
much has been written about the case , which overruled an earlier decision and forced states to create taxpayer - funded public defender offices			2
movies and documentaries have also been made			0
@entity17 was charged with breaking into a @entity19 , @entity20 , pool hall on june 3 , 1961			1
the place was vandalized and money stolen from a cash register			0
a witness later claimed he saw @entity17 leaving the business at 5:30 a.m. with a wine bottle and money in his pocket			1
based on that , he was charged with petty larceny and breaking and entering			1
he was denied a court - appointed lawyer in state court , represented himself and was convicted			1
here are some of the key moments of the case in the words of those involved : " mr. @entity17 , i am sorry , but i can not appoint counsel to represent you in this case			1
under the laws of the state of @entity20 , the only time the court can appoint counsel to represent a defendant is when that person is charged with a capital offense			1
i am sorry , but i will have to deny your request to appoint counsel to defend you in this case			2
@entity17 , to the trial judge : " the @entity4 says i am entitled to be represented by counsel			1
" -- @entity57 , @entity20 , courtroom , august 4 , 1961			1
" @entity17 seemed a man whose own private hopes and fears had long since been deadened by adversity -- a used - up man , looking ( 15 ) years older than his actual age of ( 52 )			1
he appeared gaunt , a stooped 6 feet , 140 pounds			0
" he spoke " in a slow , sad , defeated voice			0
" -- @entity65 , author of " @entity66 , " a 1964 book about the case			2
an appeal to the @entity20 @entity4 was denied , so he launched another			1
" i , @entity17 , claim that i was denied the rights of the 4th , 5th and 14th amendments of the @entity72			1
" -- @entity17 's 1962 handwritten petition to the @entity4			1
" it makes no difference how old i am or what color i am or what church i belong too [ sic ] if any			0
the question is i did not get a fair trial			2
the question is very simple			0
" -- @entity17 's petition			1
" i think @entity82 vs. @entity83 [ the 1942 precedent ] was wrong when it was decided			0
i think time has made that clear			0
and i think that the time has come that the correct rule , the civilized rule , the rule of individualism , the rule of due process must be stated by this court			0
" -- @entity93 , the court - appointed attorney and future @entity4 justice who argued @entity17 's appeal before the high court , january 15 , 1963			1
" i believe that this case dramatically illustrates the point that you can not have a fair trial without counsel			1
indeed , i believe that ... a criminal court , is not properly constituted ... under our adversary system of law , unless there is a judge and unless there is a counsel for the prosecution and unless there is a counsel for the defense			2
without that , how can a civilized nation pretend that it is having a fair trial ? -- fortas in his oral argument			2
" in our adversary system of criminal justice , any person haled into court , who is too poor to hire a lawyer , can not be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him			1
this seems to us to be an obvious truth			0
... the right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries , but it is in ours			0
from the very beginning , our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law			0
this noble ideal can not be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him			2
" -- justice @entity153 , writing the march 18 , 1963 , @entity4 opinion			1
" in the decades since this remarkable case -- and @entity17 's retrial , at which he was found not guilty -- public defender systems have been established in some states and strengthened in others			1
additional court actions have expanded the right to counsel in juvenile and certain misdemeanor cases			0
and our nation has made significant strides in fulfilling the promise of @entity17 - and ensuring quality representation for more of those who need it			2
" yet , despite half a century of progress -- even today , in 2013 -- far too many @entity172 struggle to gain access to the legal assistance they need			0
and far too many children and adults routinely enter our juvenile and criminal justice systems with little understanding of the rights to which they 're entitled , the charges against them , or the potential sentences they may face			2
in short , @entity172 's indigent defense systems exist in a state of crisis			0
-- attorney general @entity187 at friday 's 50th anniversary event			0
" i will not be proud of this biography			0
there will be no cause of pride , nor will it be the absolute truth			0
i can not remember or desire to remember that well			0
also , being only a human being , i will try , though i know i can not to justify myself through this outline			0
