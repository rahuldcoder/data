-- @entity2 @entity1 could become one of @entity6 's brightest @entity5 talents , if he can step out of the shadows of a legend : his mum			1
@entity1 is the son of @entity10 , who led @entity6 's women to the basketball world title in 1994 and @entity5 silver at the @entity14 two years later			1
" @entity16 is a celebrity at the level of a great soccer star here in @entity6 , " says basketball writer @entity15			1
" she was a born scorer , a ' clutch player ' -- it was almost impossible to block her shots			2
she was always on tv			0
" @entity1 says : " every time i 'm walking down the street with my mum , there are a lot of fans taking photos of her and people asking for autographs			1
sometimes that gets boring -- but it 's nice			0
" a fraction taller than his mother at 180 cm ( 5 foot 10 inches ) , the teen has shunned a career in basketball			2
his heart is set on an entirely different sport : dressage			2
" i have my mother 's blood when it comes to sport , but my father bred horses			0
when i was young , i spent all my time with them , " says the 18 - year - old , whose mother played in the @entity54 ' 96 basketball final just months after he was born			1
" if my mother was someone else , i would n't be talking to you			0
a lot of people in the media speak to me because they know my mum			0
i think that 's a good thing : it 's good for me , and good for my job			0
" with a home @entity5 two years away , the @entity6 equestrian team is in the middle of an unprecedented push for success on the world stage			1
@entity1 belongs to the next generation of @entity6 riding talent hoping to capture imaginations , if not medals , at @entity75			1
@entity6 has virtually no history of dressage -- one of three equestrian disciplines at the @entity5 -- so @entity1 has moved to @entity80 , one of the sport 's leading nations , to find better tuition			1
" i do n't want to win in @entity85 -- i do n't think that 's possible , " he says			0
" i have a lot to learn and @entity88 is too strong in the sport			0
but i 'm here , and i will learn like a @entity88			0
i think i can be a good rider			0
" the nation has hired world - renowned experts to help its riders develop			2
@entity96 's @entity95 , for example , is coaching the @entity6 eventing team			1
@entity95 is one of the most successful riders in the history of eventing , which combines dressage , cross-country riding and showjumping			1
at 58 , he has twice won @entity5 titles ( in 1984 and 1988 ) alongside three bronze medals , including one at @entity107			1
" the @entity6 are a long way behind , but they 're very enthusiastic , " says the 58 - year - old , who coaches some of the riders at his base in @entity112 , @entity113 , alongside several trips to @entity115 each year			1
" one of the things which struck us most is how little they knew			0
yes , they could all ride			0
but as far as training horses goes ? a lot of them did n't have much of an idea about basic stuff			0
" another thing i will say is that the funding system from the government is very hard to fathom			0
although there is money available , the system is n't practical and there are huge amounts of red tape			0
you 're asked to do a job and they say there will be help , but you spend six months of the year faffing around			0
" moving to @entity88 , like those who have moved to train with @entity95 , is a rite of passage for many @entity6 riders			1
standards are markedly higher east of the @entity145			0
showjumper @entity146 moved to @entity147 to further his career , even though -- unlike dressage and eventing -- his discipline has history in @entity6			1
@entity146 is aiming to follow in the footsteps of his hero , @entity154 , at his home games in @entity85			1
@entity156 , now 41 , became a star of @entity6 horse sport by winning jumping gold at the @entity160 in 2004			1
he has a world title and many other honors to his name			0
" @entity154 has always been my idol , " says @entity146			1
" when they talk about horses , people talk about @entity154 -- even people who have never seen showjumping			1
they know who he is			0
" there will never be another @entity154 but i want to win medals and events like he did			1
" the 26 - year - old spent his childhood on the road with his father , a moderately successful eventer named @entity175 , at tournaments across @entity6			1
" everything is completely different in @entity88 , " says the younger @entity146			0
" in @entity6 almost everyone has grooms , everyone is spoiled			2
here in @entity88 , most people do all the jobs themselves -- they help the horse themselves , they know how to do everything			0
" luckily , my dad always made me do everything too , so i had some experience of that			0
otherwise , i would have arrived here and been completely lost			0
" @entity6 has no shortage of aspiring talent : comparatively new faces like @entity1 and @entity146 line up alongside the likes of @entity194 in showjumping and @entity196 -- the first @entity197 - @entity6 to reach the @entity5 , who taught a young @entity1 -- in dressage			1
then there is @entity201 , who made her @entity5 dressage debut at @entity203 aged just 16 , the youngest equestrian rider in the history of the @entity5			1
but @entity95 says @entity6 's success in 2016 will depend on finding quality horses before @entity85			1
" no matter how good the riders are , you 've got to have good horses , too , " he cautions			2
" and good horses take time to produce			0
" one of the biggest problems for @entity6 is the lack of horse power			2
although the @entity5 are two years away , two years is nothing in terms of getting a horse educated to compete against all the other countries at the top level			2
" the @entity221 , taking place in @entity223 , are the biggest test of @entity6 riders -- and their current lineup of horses -- prior to the @entity75			1
but the riders are already looking to @entity85 , and what could be the greatest equestrian show of their lives			2
" @entity6 will put on a great party , " says @entity146 , who rode well to sit 22nd , seven places behind compatriot @entity156 , after two rounds of showjumping at the @entity221			2
" many people said many things about the @entity239 -- even @entity6 were saying bad things about it -- but in the end , it was a big success			2
" this is a big country , and we have a lot of issues , but when the time comes for an event we have really good people who love to host foreigners and put on a good show			2
" every day , when you wake up in the morning , an @entity5 in your own country gives you the motivation to keep working			2
i think it 's going to be amazing			0
