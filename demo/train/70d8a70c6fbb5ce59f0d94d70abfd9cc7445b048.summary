it started with a sore throat on @entity3 and an antibiotic from a friend who wanted to help			1
now 19 - year - old @entity6 is fighting for her life inside a @entity11 hospital 's burn unit , suffering from an allergic reaction that 's so severe she has large open wounds all over her body			1
" it is heartbreaking , every day is a different look			0
every day , she 's like , shedding away			1
... overnight , it 's a whole different person that you 're looking at , " @entity19 , @entity6 's aunt , told @entity1 affiliate @entity20			1
doctors diagnosed @entity6 with @entity24 , a rare disease that can be triggered by antibiotics or other medications			1
" when she took the medication , she started having a hard time breathing , and she told her mom that her lips were burning , her throat , her eyes , they got so red that she could n't talk			1
so she rushed her to the @entity35 , and that 's when they diagnosed her with the disease			1
and from there it has just spiraled to a nightmare , " @entity19 said			1
now @entity6 , the mother of a 4 - month - old , is in critical condition at the @entity43 , burn center			1
her prognosis is good , even though the disease has a high mortality rate , according to dr. @entity48 , the center 's director			1
but the situation , @entity51 's family says , has been devastating			2
" just unreal , just watching your daughter burn in front of you , literally , burn in front of you , " her mother , @entity57 , told @entity20			1
" every day , a new blister , a new burn , a new scar			2
and she 's just , ' @entity64 , i want to go home			2
' and i ca n't take her home			0
i ca n't put water on her lips			0
" @entity64 : ' do n't share medication ' on a website created to raise funds for @entity6 's care , her mother said the harrowing ordeal began soon after her daughter took the medicine			1
" a friend offered her an antibiotic pill that she had from a previous illness , " @entity57 wrote			2
" she was thinking that it would help her			0
this would be the biggest mistake of her life			0
" now , @entity57 says she 's hoping to spread the word so others do n't make the same mistake			2
" do n't share medication			0
do n't give someone else your medication			0
do n't offer medication , " she said			0
she also advises parents to find out what their children are allergic to -- before it 's too late			1
doctor : reaction causing skin to separate at first , doctors diagnosed @entity6 with @entity24 , which refers to a condition where between 10 % and 30 % of the skin on the body is affected , @entity48 said			1
now she 's experiencing @entity102 , the diagnosis when more than 30 % of the body is affected			2
@entity48 estimates that 65 % of @entity106 's skin and mucus membranes have been affected			2
the allergic reaction is causing layers of @entity106 's skin to separate , @entity48 said , creating lesions that grow into large open wounds			1
" patients can experience problems with taste , swallowing , eyesight and sexual functions can be affected			0
in @entity119 's case , we are particularly concerned because her eyes have been affected			2
this can cause scarring of the corneas , which could lead to permanent blindness , " he said			0
" we are trying to prevent that from happening			0
" photos on the fundraising website show @entity6 lying in a hospital bed , with openings for her eyes cut from the bandages that cover her			1
as part of her treatment for the disease , doctors have wrapped her body in a special dressing , @entity48 said			0
" we have chosen to place a dressing that adheres to the open wound , which allows her skin to heal without having to remove the bandages to wash the wounds , " he said			0
mortality for those suffering from @entity24 and @entity102 can be as high as 25 % in adults , but tends to be lower with early treatment , according to the @entity151			0
though it 's uncommon , @entity48 said his hospital has treated around six cases in the past year , because the burn center has experience treating open wounds			1
" this is very sobering			0
the fact that you can get a life - threatening situation from taking a medication			0
it can happen , and most people do n't think twice about taking pills for things , " @entity48 said			0
" in fact , most of the time you do have some sort of side reaction to medication , just not this severe			2
" after recovering from @entity24 , patients usually only have minor issues with their skin , such as dryness , @entity48 said			0
" hopefully new skin will come in , " @entity57 told @entity20			1
" i 'm just there watching			0
all i can tell her is , " @entity180 on , hang on			0
' " @entity1 's @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report .			1
