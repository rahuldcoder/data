-- @entity1 opened its exclusive membership to women monday for the first time in its 80 - year history			1
former @entity7 secretary of state @entity6 and @entity9 businesswoman @entity8 will become the first women to join the @entity1 , @entity12 , club , chairman @entity13 said monday in a statement			1
" these accomplished women share our passion for the game of golf and both are well known and respected by our membership , " @entity13 said			0
the issue of its formerly all - male membership has long dogged the private club and has at times threatened to overshadow the @entity27 , among golf 's most prestigious events			1
celebration , surprise , humor after @entity1 admits first women women 's rights activist @entity34 put the issue in the spotlight in 2003 , when she led a protest against the club and worked to put pressure on corporate leaders to withdraw their support for the organization and the masters			1
on monday , she declared victory			0
" my first reaction was , we won -- and we did , " @entity34 said			2
" by we , i mean the women 's movement and women in the @entity7 , particularly those in business			1
" she said continued pressure from women 's groups and corporate interests forced the club 's hand			1
activists over the last decade " facilitated a couple of sex discrimination suits against corporations whose ceos are ( @entity1 ) members , " @entity34 said , but she did not name any corporations or individuals			1
@entity34 also pointed to the april controversy over the club 's failure to admit @entity70 ceo @entity69 , as it has past @entity70 leaders			1
sponsoring the masters usually guarantees membership to a company 's officers			0
but @entity69 had been ineligible because she is female			0
" we gave them a pretty big black eye in april when they dissed @entity81 and did not allow her in the club as they had all of the males preceding her as @entity61 of @entity70			0
and i think they knew they could not sustain it , " she said			0
at the time , @entity90 spokesman @entity89 said president @entity91 believed women should be admitted to the club			1
@entity13 declined to comment on the issue then , and is not talking about it now outside of the statement issued by the club , according to club spokesman @entity96			2
in that statement , @entity13 said the decision marked a " significant and positive time " for @entity1			1
@entity101 commissioner @entity100 lauded the decision			0
" at a time when women represent one of the fastest growing segments in both playing and following the game of golf , this sends a positive and inclusive message for our sport , " @entity100 said in a statement			2
he was far from alone in applauding @entity1 's decision			1
@entity114 -- the @entity115 's presumptive presidential nominee who , in april , had said that he 'd admit women if he were in charge of the club -- offered congratulations on @entity120 to both his friend @entity121 and @entity1			1
and @entity122 , a @entity124 inductee who played parts of two seasons in a men 's professional league , likewise cheered the move			0
" @entity131 breaking thru # equality , " she wrote on @entity120			0
" slowly but surely lots of crumbs ad up to a cake , " wrote another women 's sports pioneer , @entity134			1
@entity91 " welcomes the development " as well , @entity89 said monday			2
" he thinks it was too long in coming , but obviously believes it was the right thing to do , " the @entity90 spokesman told reporters			1
the choice of @entity121 and @entity8 will ensure that women admitted to @entity1 will be equals to their male counterparts , @entity34 said			1
" they have chosen two groundbreaking women , two very prominent women , who are clearly equal in stature to the other members who are , of course , all male , " @entity34 said			1
" i think it would have been a mistake to choose a lower - profile woman and basically make that statement that , yes , we 're letting women in but they 're not really going to be equal with the men			0
" @entity121 served under president @entity160 as the first female national security adviser and the first @entity163 - @entity7 woman to hold the post of secretary of state			0
she also was on president @entity168 's @entity167 staff and was a special assistant to the director of the @entity171 in 1986			0
membership is the latest honor for @entity121 she grew up in humble beginnings in segregated @entity175 , @entity176 , and rose to prominence in academia and international diplomacy			0
she has been on the faculty of @entity181 since 1981 , has authored two best - selling books and is a member of various boards and a fellow of the @entity186 , and has been awarded 10 honorary doctorates			0
@entity121 , who is also an accomplished pianist , said in a statement released through @entity1 that she is " delighted and honored " to join the club			2
" i have long admired the important role @entity1 has played in the traditions and history of golf , " she said			2
@entity8 is the vice president of @entity194 , the investment firm founded by her husband , @entity195			2
@entity196 once named her among the top 50 women in business , and the @entity200 's business school is named in her honor			0
@entity1 admits one of ' toughest ' women in business she is also chairwoman of the @entity205 , a nonprofit that says it is dedicated to producing " dramatic and sustained growth in the creation , distribution and retention of wealth for every person in @entity9			2
" @entity8 said she is " extremely grateful for this privilege			0
" " i am fortunate to have many friends who are members at @entity1 , so to be asked to join them as a member represents a very happy and important occasion in my life , " she said			2
@entity34 's protests against the club 's policies made @entity1 the focus of national attention beginning in 2002 , when she wrote letters challenging the male - only membership policy at the club			1
the club 's chairman at the time , @entity225 , responded that admitting women as members would not be done " at the point of a bayonet			1
" the next year , @entity34 organized protests to coincide with the masters , which drew widespread attention			0
the uproar led @entity1 to decide not to have advertising for the @entity237 broadcast of the masters in 2003 and 2004			0
in 2006 , @entity34 was among a group of @entity241 shareholders who accused the company of violating its discrimination policies by supporting the golf tournament			0
on monday , the syndicated newspaper columnist and co-founder of @entity249 women 's equity advocacy group said she hopes @entity1 's decision " cracks open that glass ceiling just a little bit further " for @entity7 businesswomen			1
at the same time , @entity34 called the development " just one small step			2
" " ( @entity257 ) need to be working toward parity in the halls of power ; @entity1 is just one , " she said			0
" it 's an important one symbolically , but we have a long way to go			0
" @entity1 no longer just a ' boys club ' @entity0 's @entity265 contributed to this report .			1
