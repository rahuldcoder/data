-- a month before spc. @entity2 opened fire at @entity5 's @entity4 , he was under the care of military doctors , having been evaluated and treated for depression , anxiety and sleep disorders , according to military officials			1
@entity2 reportedly purchased his .45 caliber @entity13 handgun legally at @entity15 , a gun store near @entity17 , @entity18 , on march 1			1
he had no criminal history that would disqualify him from owning a gun in @entity18			1
his background check was clear			0
barely a month later , that same gun would be used to end the lives of three people and wound 16 others before being used by @entity2 to kill himself			1
but should he have been allowed to have that gun in the first place ? the answer is n't as simple as some gun control advocates would want , nor as black and white as many @entity31 advocates would claim , especially for those in the military			1
latest @entity5 shooting revives broader gun debate first , let me be clear : if @entity2 had been determined to have been suffering from a severe enough form of mental illness to have posed a threat to himself or others -- or had a history of violence -- he should never have been allowed to remain in the @entity44 in the first place , much less allowed to own a gun			1
there is , at best , conflicting evidence in this case whether that was true			0
but if he was only diagnosed with one of the more common , milder form of mental illness -- the same kinds of ailments that afflict millions of nonviolent @entity55 every day -- then there is little evidence to support that taking away his right to own a gun would be the prudent or legal thing to do , even for a soldier in the military			1
psychiatric issues ' fundamental underlying causal factor ' mental illness , much like physical illness , covers a whole spectrum , from mild disorders like depression to severe issues such as paranoia and schizophrenia			1
the military already attempts to screen out new recruits who have anything more than a mild problem			1
there are screens as you come into the military -- some of which are based on self - reporting -- and there is screening when you return from a deployment or combat			1
for instance , everybody coming back from deployment has a post-deployment health assessment			0
then , three to six months later , they get a post-deployment health re-assessment			0
if primary care personnel see any problems with a soldier and depression or anxiety , then he or she is referred to behavioral health experts for a deeper assessment			0
but there lies the tricky part			0
because much of these issues rely on self - reporting , if a soldier , sailor , airman or @entity107 wants to stay in the military , by and large they 'll just say " everything is fine			2
" there are two kinds of soldiers : the one who is trying to stay in the military , who is not going to admit to anything that may lead to being kicked out , and the one who is trying to leave the military , who is more likely to come clean and get treatment for things like post-traumatic stress disorder			1
that 's why their buddies play an important role			0
in the military , there is a strong sense of the need to watch out for your fellow soldier , but that also means taking care of fellow soldiers if they need treatment for difficulties			1
as we have seen the skyrocketing of suicides among active duty military personnel , i helped to develop a card called @entity144 -- @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147			2
if you are worried about a buddy , ask if they are ok , take care of them if they need help and then bring them to a base chaplain , mental health official or their commanding officer			2
but there is still much more to be done to prevent military suicides and tragic incidents like what we saw wednesday at @entity5			1
@entity165 : 9 questions , answered we 've seen the immediate " stressers " that have led to the dramatic increase in suicides in the military tend to be either problems in relationships -- spouses , friends , family -- or problems in the workplace			2
often , they both can be happening at once ; we call that a psychological toxin			0
for instance , say your girlfriend tells you she 's pregnant by another man , or your boss or commanding officer is giving you a hard time on the job			0
if those happen separately , they can be difficult to manage , particularly for someone with severe mental illness			1
but when they happen at the same time -- particularly if there are delusions , paranoia and easy access to weapons -- it can be a deadly spark			0
so , we need to be extra vigilant when looking for those stressers , and help those in the military who need someone to talk to			2
but we also need to take a more complex approach			0
people tend to think there are easy answers : either strict gun control or throwing everybody who is mentally ill into the asylum			1
it 's really a more nuanced conversation			2
it 's about how you promote responsible gun ownership			2
it 's about trigger locks and gun safes and other ways to at least slow down someone in a fit of rage , to make it harder for them to take their weapon into a barracks or navy yard and start shooting			2
it 's about how we provide for jobs and opportunities when people leave the service			0
a good job is a very good form of mental health intervention , as it often comes with good health benefits and a sense of structure and purpose			0
it 's less about whether we should be afraid of a soldier with @entity165 , and instead more about how , as a society , we care for our returning veterans			0
join us on @entity246 / @entity245			0
@entity0 's @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report			0

dr. @entity251 : debate around gun control and the mentally ill is nuanced
a lone gunman killed three people and then himself at @entity5 on wednesday
mental illness can cover an entire spectrum , from mild to severe
military screens recruits and returning soldiers for severe mental illness , she says
