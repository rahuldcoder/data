-- @entity1 is fighting to educate girls in rural @entity3 , where terrorists will stop at nothing to keep them from learning			1
despite the threat of violence , @entity1 continues to open the doors of her @entity9			1
she and her team are providing a free education to about 350 girls , many of whom would not normally have access to school			1
@entity0 asked @entity1 for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity19 of 2012			1
@entity0 : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a top 10 @entity19 ? @entity1 : i was in @entity24 ( an @entity3 town northwest of @entity26 ) when i got a call in my room			1
i could not believe my ears			0
i started to cry , then i felt a great joy , and i started to laugh			0
i started to jump up and down			0
it is the greatest honor to be among these selfless human beings			0
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to the @entity9 ? jan : it has given me more strength and determination to go forward to continue giving these girls an opportunity to get education and gain self - respect			1
it has given me a lifetime opportunity , a golden chance to continue my struggle to break the vicious cycle of violence against women and girls by providing education in a country where women have no rights to exist as an equal			1
i see a ray of hope that will shine all over the world and make them aware of a very small accomplishment that is changing the lives of these girls			2
from the day i opened the doors of the @entity9 , my effort was and is to provide security and the best education for these girls			2
hopefully , they will have a better future			0
... i 'm the luckiest person in the world to get this honor and to help these kids			0
@entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity19 ? jan : all the money will go to the ( @entity1 's @entity75 ) foundation so we can continue to educate these girls			1
we 've never closed the school , even during the holidays , so the girls are there during the winter			1
i want to buy them boots and jackets ; all of them walk to school			2
and i would like to buy a new van for the teachers to transport them			0
my ( big ) goal is to build more classrooms			0
every year i have 55 or 60 new girls , and space is really limited ; they 're small rooms			2
also , i want to do adult education for the young women who have never been to school			1
i would like to start and help 20 to 25 women			2
let 's make their life a little better			0
these are very small things , but i think each step will make things better for each woman and each girl			0
it 's changing their world			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? jan : all my life , i tried my best to be a helping hand to people and animals in need , even though what i have done was in the very small way that i could afford			0
it took a lot of determination and courage to build the first girls school in an area where the girls did not count			1
now , with hard work , i have proven to the men of seven villages surrounding the school that this is the best thing that 's happened for their daughters to get educated			2
