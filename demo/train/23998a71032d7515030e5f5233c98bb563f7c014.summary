-- they say that truth is stranger than fiction			2
and while we 're not exactly sure when that phrase was coined , we 're guessing it was after reading about these guys and gals			2
@entity9 reportedly gave @entity10 " the bird " idea for famous poem			1
@entity14 when @entity16 poet and novelist @entity14 died on january 11 , 1928 , his literary contemporaries decided he was too important to be buried in his hometown 's simple churchyard			1
but the good people of @entity21 , where @entity14 had spent nearly all of his 88 years , vehemently disagreed			2
so the two groups reached a grisly compromise			2
the author 's body was cremated , and his ashes were interred in the @entity29 's corner of @entity30			1
@entity14 's heart , on the other hand , was placed inside a small casket and buried beside the grave of his first wife in a @entity21 churchyard			2
to this day , a rumor persists that the author 's heart was accidentally devoured by his housekeeper 's cat , and that the heart of a pig was buried in its place			1
@entity45 apparently , the author of more than 120 " rags - to - riches " books featuring hard - working , highly moral young heroes was also an admitted pederast			1
before finding success as an author , @entity45 was a minister at a @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , where he was accused of sexually assaulting two young boys			1
@entity45 admitted his guilt , but left town before the news hit the street			0
later , he wound up in @entity61 , where he penned hundreds of best - selling books for and about young boys , which went on to grace the shelves of homes , schools and church libraries across @entity69			0
@entity70 best known for his collection of short stories , @entity73 , @entity74 , and for mentoring such literary heavyweights as @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , @entity70 had a knack for unexpected exits			1
one day in november 1912 , while serving as president of the successful @entity82 , he simply got up and walked out of his office to pursue a career in writing			0
years later , he made another sudden departure , this time during the middle of a @entity89 voyage			0
at his farewell cocktail party , @entity70 unknowingly swallowed a toothpick hidden within an hors d'oeuvre			1
the author sailed on , but the toothpick did n't , penetrating his intestines and causing peritonitis			1
@entity70 became ill aboard ship and later died in a @entity98 hospital			1
@entity9 a number of pets graced the @entity9 household over the years , including all manner of dogs , cats and ponies			0
but @entity9 ' favorite pets were his two ravens , both known as @entity109			0
@entity9 was particularly devoted to grip i , going so far as to write the bird into his 1841 mystery novel , @entity113			0
this same talkative bird reportedly was the inspiration for @entity10 's famous poem , " @entity117 , " published four years later			1
upon @entity119 's demise , @entity9 had his beloved bird stuffed			0
these days , @entity109 can be seen at the @entity121 of @entity123 's @entity122 , where he stands guard over the @entity10 and @entity9 collections			0
@entity126 @entity9 apparently was n't the only well - known writer who had a fetish for fowl			0
@entity126 , author of 32 short stories including " @entity131 " and " @entity135 , " developed a love for birds at a very young age			1
growing up on her family 's estate in @entity138 , @entity126 enjoyed playing with the chickens they raised there and reportedly taught one of them to walk backward , making the chicken somewhat of a local celebrity			0
but @entity126 had a special fondness for peacocks , which she often used in her fiction to represent @entity149			0
when she returned to live on the family farm as an adult , she raised an unusually large flock of peacocks , which she tended to until her death in 1964			0
afterward , they were donated to various parks and monasteries around @entity138 , but all were eventually killed by predators			1
@entity160 @entity160 ( born @entity160 ) may have been the master of the popular short story form , but he was far less skilled when it came to money			1
while working as a bank teller in @entity166 , the fledgling author was accused of embezzling a few thousand dollars , prompting his rather sudden move to @entity168			1
but a few years later , when he came back to visit his dying wife , he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison			2
it was here that convict @entity160 assumed the pen name @entity160			1
his incarceration offered him the time to write as well as a chance to mix with a slew of seedy characters , perfect fodder for his fiction			0
a model inmate , @entity160 was released in 1901 , after serving just three years			1
he passed away in 1910 with 600 stories , but reportedly only 33 cents , to his name			0
@entity185 poet , playwright , novelist , essayist and all - around literary luminary , @entity185 achieved fame during the @entity192			1
but before that , @entity185 was a struggling young writer , working menial jobs to support his burgeoning poetry habit			1
in 1925 , while working at a restaurant in @entity197 , @entity185 tucked a few of his poems under the dinner plate of then - reigning poet @entity201			1
@entity201 shared the poems during his reading that night , and in the morning , @entity185 was crowned @entity201 's new discovery , the " busboy poet			1
" @entity185 went on to become one of @entity69 's most prolific authors			1
@entity201 , however , died six years later after drinking a bottle of @entity209			0
@entity210 @entity210 , winner of the @entity211 for her 1920 novel @entity213 , is famous for her vivid stories and novels about upper - class society in the late 19th century			2
it was a setting she knew well , coming from a wealthy and distinguished @entity219 family			0
but the high society author had a lesser - known career as a humanitarian			2
during @entity222 , @entity210 traveled to the @entity223 in @entity224 , both to write about the battlefields for @entity89 publications and to help the @entity228 create hostels and schools for those displaced by war			0
in 1916 , she was awarded the legion of honor , @entity224 's highest civilian appointment , years before the height of her literary career			0
@entity237 @entity237 may have been the author of the romantic classic @entity239 , but she was not well served by love herself			2
in fact , it more or less killed her			2
in june of 1854 , a starry - eyed @entity237 married her father 's curate and soon became pregnant			0
during her pregnancy , she fell ill , and according to her earliest biographer , @entity246 , she was attacked by " sensations of perpetual nausea and ever - recurring faintness			0
" the elder @entity237 sister 's nausea was so overwhelming , in fact , that the author could n't eat or even smell food without becoming violently ill. on march 31 , 1855 , a dehydrated , malnourished and severely exhausted @entity237 died at the age of 38			2
