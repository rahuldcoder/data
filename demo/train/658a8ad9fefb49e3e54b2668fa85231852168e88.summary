-- @entity2 has destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing , filling and production facilities , and all of the chemical weapons at inspected sites have been placed under seal , the @entity1 said thursday			1
" so far we have good , measurable and demonstrative progress and we have constructive collaboration , " head of the @entity10 / @entity1 mission @entity8 told @entity0			0
the watchdog body 's announcement of the facilities ' destruction means that the first deadline has been met in an ambitious program to eliminate the country 's entire chemical weapons stockpile by the middle of next year			1
the joint @entity10 - @entity1 mission visited 21 out of 23 sites , the @entity1 statement said , and 39 of the 41 facilities at those sites			1
the remaining two sites were too dangerous for the inspectors to go to , it said , but @entity2 had declared those sites as abandoned			2
the chemical weapons equipment there was moved to other sites , which were inspected			1
the @entity1 said it was " now satisfied that it has verified -- and seen destroyed -- all of @entity2 's declared critical production and mixing / filling equipment			1
" additionally , the @entity1 says all of the chemical weapons at the inspected sites were placed under seal during the inspectors ' visits and @entity8 is confident that they are now tamper - proof			1
however , some observers say questions remain			0
because @entity1 inspectors were unable to visit two of the sites , the watchdog " is only certifying functional destruction of @entity2 self - declared equipment from self - declared sites , " @entity47 , director of aerospace and defense consulting for @entity50 's , said			1
the @entity1 announcement is " a significant milestone " -- and it 's " remarkable " that the @entity1 was able to destroy the equipment in a conflict zone -- but @entity2 still has its stockpile of functioning chemical weapons , " so destruction of the production equipment has little to no impact on their immediate capabilities			1
only after those weapons have been destroyed or removed from @entity2 control will the state be demilitarized , " said @entity47 , a former treaty compliance officer for the @entity70 military			2
other concerns are that the @entity1 did n't have enough time after the declaration to " look for inconsistencies with their own intelligence " and whether the @entity2 regime can be trusted to disclose all of its capabilities , he said			2
" @entity2 likely assesses there is little chance that lack of candor in their declaration will be discovered in the short - term , " @entity47 said			2
likewise , a senior official with access to the latest intelligence said the @entity70 continues to watch closely behind the scenes for any indication of undeclared material moving to either @entity95 enclaves , or across the border to @entity97			0
@entity2 's government is led by president @entity99 , a member of the @entity102 offshoot @entity95 sect			1
" our assessment is it is unlikely @entity2 will declare and / or destroy all of their chemical weapons , " the official said			1
meanwhile , @entity110 's @entity109 , reported that @entity2 foreign minister @entity111 has asked international inspectors to spare 12 of its chemical weapons factories so that they can be converted into civilian chemical facilities			1
the request was made in a confidential letter to @entity118 , director general of the @entity1 , according to @entity109			0
" there 's a real concern that the @entity2 might be trying to preserve some of their chemical weapons capabilities , " said a @entity70 official in response to the story			1
the official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation			0
' most challenging mission ever ' eight inspectors who have been in @entity2 as part of an advance team that arrived on october 1 have now returned to the @entity131 , where the @entity1 is based , said @entity118 , the director general			1
he praised the " fortitude and courage " they had shown in " fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization			0
" no further inspections are currently planned , given the progress made , the statement said			0
the next milestone for the mission will be november 15 , it said , when the body 's executive council must approve a detailed plan submitted by @entity2 for the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile			1
there was no let - up thursday in the violence that has raged for more than 2Â½ years in @entity2			2
the opposition @entity151 reported shelling in the @entity153 and @entity154 areas of @entity155 and intermittent clashes between the @entity157 and government forces in the @entity155 suburbs			0
talks with @entity99 diplomatic moves toward ending the conflict -- in which more than 100,000 people have died , according to @entity10 estimates -- continued this week			0
@entity10 envoy to @entity2 @entity166 talked with @entity2 president @entity99 in @entity155 on wednesday in their first meeting since december			0
@entity166 spoke to @entity99 about the framework for holding a planned conference involving all parties in the conflict in @entity172 , @entity173			0
@entity174 told @entity166 that any political solution to the crisis in @entity2 hinges on outside countries cutting off support to the rebels , according to state - run media			2
" any success for any political solution must be linked to the end of any military support to military groups and to pressure the countries that are supporting these groups and are facilitating the entry of the terrorists and mercenaries into @entity2 by providing money and military support , " @entity99 said during the meeting , according to @entity2 state television			0
he added , " this is an important step to prepare the framework to allow a national dialogue and put clear mechanisms to reach the desired objectives at the upcoming peace talks			0
" the @entity2 conflict began in march 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the @entity204 movement and is now a full - blown civil war			2
@entity0 's @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
