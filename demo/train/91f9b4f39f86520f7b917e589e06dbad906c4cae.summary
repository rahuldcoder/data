-- one of the most infamous defendants in @entity3 trials of recent years took two big steps friday toward clearing her name , and she vowed to " keep fighting			0
" @entity10 's 5th @entity9 threw out two of @entity13 's four convictions of lying to authorities as they investigated the disappearance of @entity16 's 2 - year - old daughter , @entity13			1
the appeals judges agreed with @entity16 's argument that the multiple convictions amounted to double jeopardy			1
but the judges upheld the other two convictions			0
in an internationally publicized and emotionally charged case , @entity16 was tried in 2011 and acquitted of murder charges in the death of @entity13			2
the child was last seen june 16 , 2008 , but was not reported missing until july 15 , 2008 , when @entity13 's mother tracked her daughter down and demanded answers regarding @entity13 's whereabouts			1
investigators searched for the child for five months , eventually finding @entity13 's skeletal remains in woods less than a mile from her grandparents ' @entity36 home			1
while she was acquitted in the death of her young daughter , @entity16 was convicted of the four counts of lying to authorities			1
those charges arose from statements @entity16 made on july 16 , 2008 , to @entity45 detective @entity44 , who was investigating the disappearance of @entity13			2
according to friday 's court filing , the appeals judges rejected @entity16 's claim that statements she made before being read her miranda rights should not have been allowed in the trial			1
and they rejected her argument that the state statute she was convicted of violating is unconstitutionally vague			0
@entity16 's lawyer , @entity57 , said when he called his client to share the ruling that two of the four convictions had been overturned , she said , " we keep fighting			1
" @entity16 could appeal the remaining two convictions to the @entity10 @entity66 next			2
read how @entity16 's prosecutor has no regrets when questioned early in the investigation , @entity13 admitted to police that she had n't seen @entity13 for more than 30 days , and on july 16 , 2008 , she was arrested on suspicion of child neglect , filing false official statements and obstructing a criminal investigation			1
at that time , she made the statements to @entity44 , which led to her convictions			0
after nearly three years of legal maneuvers , @entity16 's capital murder trial began on may 24 , 2011			2
prosecutors alleged that she killed @entity13 by using chloroform and covering her nose and mouth with duct tape , and that she put her body in the trunk of her car before dumping it in the woods			2
defense attorney @entity89 argued that @entity13 drowned in the @entity16 family pool on june 16 , 2008 , and that @entity13 and her father , @entity91 , covered up the death			2
watch : a year after trial , where 's @entity16 ? on july 5 , 2011 , a jury found @entity16 not guilty of first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter of a child , while convicting her on the four " false information " counts			1
@entity16 was sentenced to four years in jail , to be served consecutively			0
but with her time in jail as she awaited trial counting against the jail terms , she was released 10 days after her sentencing , on july 17			0
even though she exited shortly after midnight , about 1,000 people jeered her as police guards and @entity89 escorted her to a waiting suv and drove away quickly			0
@entity16 still faces a defamation lawsuit from @entity112 , of nearby @entity113 , @entity10			0
during @entity16 's disputed july 16 , 2008 , statements to @entity44 , she said the last time she had seen her daughter was when she dropped @entity13 off at @entity112 's apartment			1
@entity112 filed suit in september 2008 , claiming that @entity16 ruined her reputation			0
last april , a judge ruled that the suit needed to go to trial by jury and denied @entity112 's request for a summary judgment			0
