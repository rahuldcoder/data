-- the oil disaster plaguing the @entity2 and our coastal states puts our desperate need for a new clean energy economy in stark relief			1
we need to move away from dirty , dangerous and deadly energy sources			0
we are pleased that the @entity9 is now saying it will suspend any new offshore drilling while the explosion and spill are investigated , but there should be no doubt left that drilling will only harm our coasts and the people who live there			1
taking a temporary break from offshore drilling is an important step , but it 's not enough			1
we need to stop new offshore drilling for good , now			0
and then we need an aggressive plan to wean @entity24 from dirty fossil fuels in the next two decades			1
this @entity27 offshore rig that exploded was supposed to be state - of - the - art. we 've also been assured again and again that the hundreds of offshore drilling rigs along our beaches are completely safe			1
now , we 've seen workers tragically killed			1
we 've seen our ocean lit on fire , and now we 're watching hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic oil seep toward wetlands and wildlife habitat			1
this rig 's well is leaking 210,000 gallons of crude every day , wiping out aquatic life and smothering the coastal wetlands of @entity43 and @entity44			0
as the reeking slick spreads over thousands of square miles of ocean , it rapidly approaches the title of worst environmental disaster in @entity24 history , even worse than 1989 's @entity52			1
the well is under 5,000 feet of water , and it could take weeks or even months to cap it			0
this disaster could unfortunately happen at any one of the hundreds of drilling platforms off our coasts , at any moment			2
it could happen at the drilling sites that the oil industry has proposed opening along the beaches of the @entity66			2
indeed , even before this spill , the oil and gas industry had torn apart the coastal wetlands of the @entity70 over the years			2
these drilling operations have caused @entity43 to lose 25 square miles of coastal wetlands , which are natural storm barriers , each year			0
another view : why it wo n't be easy to replace fossil fuels and it 's hardly just the environmental costs of oil spills that we have to worry about with offshore drilling			1
the threat to the people who work on these platforms has again become terribly clear			0
in fact , more than 500 fires on oil platforms in the @entity2 have injured or killed dozens of workers in just the past four years , according to the federal @entity89			1
we do n't need to pay this price for energy			0
we have plenty of clean energy solutions in place that will end our dependence on dirty fossil fuels , create good , safe jobs and breathe new life into our economy			1
one huge example came thursday , when the @entity102 administration approved our country 's first offshore wind farm			0
our country has huge solar power potential as well			0
we can also save more oil through simple efficiency measures than could be recovered by new drilling on our coastlines			2
this oil spill changes everything			2
we have hit rock - bottom in our fossil fuel addiction			0
this tragedy should be a wake - up call			0
it 's time to take offshore drilling off the table for good			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity122 .			0

@entity2 spill can have *devastating* effect on wildlife and *shoreline* , says @entity122
he says we 've been assured that oil drilling is completely safe
@entity122 : workers killed , and spill could be nation 's worst environmental disaster
he says @entity24 needs *moratorium* on new drilling , plan to wean off fossil fuels
