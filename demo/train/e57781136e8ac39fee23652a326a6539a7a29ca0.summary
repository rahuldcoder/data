-- sen. @entity1 has just been handed a giant political opportunity			1
after spending several years championing the cause of the consumer and railing against the power of big banks , the @entity4 @entity3 may be perfectly positioned to react to the revelation of secretly taped conversations within the @entity12 that have exposed the cozy relationship that exists between the regulators in @entity15 and the regulated on @entity16			1
the tapes , which were made in 2012 , involve examiners for the @entity19 who are heard being protective and deferential to @entity21 when discussing some financial transactions that the firm had undertaken			1
their actions were said to be " legal but shady			0
" one of the @entity12 officials on the tape explains that they should not be too tough with the banks to make sure the lines of communication remain open in the future : " we do n't want to discourage @entity21 from disclosing these types of things in the future and therefore maybe you know some comment that says do n't mistake our inquisitiveness , and our desire to understand more about the marketplace in general , as a criticism of you as a firm necessarily			1
" the tapes have shocked many listeners because they reveal how weak the rules are and , even worse , how the regulators do n't have much interest in being tough with the banks			2
years after the horrendous financial collapse of 2008 that led to international economic havoc , @entity15 is not doing very much to improve the situation			0
there have been many critics of the @entity53 legislation who have warned that the law fell short , but to actually hear these conversations has a more powerful impact			0
as @entity58 said on an interview with @entity61 's @entity60 , when people listen to the tapes " for a moment , [ they ] get to be the fly on the wall that watches all of it , and there it is to be exposed to everyone : the cozy relationship , the fact that the @entity12 is more concerned about its relationship with a ' too - big - to - fail ' bank than it is with protecting the @entity76 public			1
" @entity58 , who was instrumental to the creation of the @entity78 , reacted to the substance of the tape by arguing that " the point of these tapes is that the regulators are backing off long before anyone 's in court making a legal argument about whether or not they came right up to the line or they crossed over the line			1
" she has called for oversight hearings as soon as possible			2
the weakness of our regulatory system for finance is an issue that deserves attention , and it is a policy problem that attracts the interest of liberals , conservatives and moderates , all of whom have been stung by the economic toll of the financial meltdown			0
anger toward the banking system is one of the few issues that provides a common thread between the disparate parts of our political world			2
tea party @entity113 hate the intimate connections between banking and politicians as much as do left - wing @entity118			0
if @entity58 handles oversight hearings on this problem in the right way , they could attract huge interest and really define who she is as a national politician , right as the 2016 presidential race heats up			1
in this case , politics and policy can work hand in hand			0
given the widespread concern about this problem and @entity58 's skill at handling this issue , these could shape up to be hearings that have the same kind of impact as sen. @entity141 's classic interrogation of officials about @entity145 's @entity144 policies in 1966 or the select committee investigation of @entity147 in 1973 when sen. @entity148 revealed all the wrongs that @entity150 had committed			1
right now the @entity118 playing field for 2016 is more fluid than many think			0
while former secretary of state @entity155 , assuming she runs , would be a formidable candidate and a clear frontrunner , there is also still room for another candidate to challenge her and potentially to rise to the top of the pack			2
while many names have been mentioned , like @entity163 gov. @entity162 or former @entity165 sen. @entity164 , nobody other than @entity167 generates the kind of excitement as does @entity1			1
@entity167 exposed some of her own vulnerabilities during the roll out for her book " @entity175 , " and there still remains big questions as to whether @entity118 will want a fresher voice , one who speaks more directly to the populist economic tradition of the party , as their candidate			2
while today it seems inevitable that she will be the party 's nominee in 2016 , @entity155 learned in 2008 that " inevitable " does n't always cut it			0
@entity58 has said that she wo n't run for the presidency			1
but these kinds of statements rarely are the best way to predict what a candidate will actually do			0
the @entity12 tapes might prove to be the development that moves her to the front and center of the public eye			0
oversight hearings would be a way to expose her to a large national audience and to demonstrate that she is deeply invested in solving the economic problems that have harmed the security of @entity76 and been at the heart of the laggard economic conditions that define our era			1
@entity58 has been a huge attraction on the campaign trail during the past few months , speaking about these very issues and promising to devote her time to this cause			2
ever since @entity4 sen. @entity213 died , @entity118 have not been able to find a new liberal lion to champion the progressive economic traditions that been so integral to the party since the @entity218			0
president @entity219 , who many @entity118 thought would be that person , has failed to live up to expectations			0
he surrounded himself with economic advisors who were comfortable with the status quo and whose pragmatism pushed him away from the bolder policies that the @entity118 base hoped for			0
now , with the disclosure of these tapes , @entity58 has a very real chance to prove to @entity118 that she is the new voice .			1

sen. @entity1 has been handed a big political opportunity , says @entity234
tapes point to signs that @entity76 regulators failed to *aggressively* challenge @entity21
@entity58 says tape expose cozy relationship with a " too big to fail " bank
@entity234 : @entity58 could use hearings on @entity21 as a *launching* point for a presidential run
