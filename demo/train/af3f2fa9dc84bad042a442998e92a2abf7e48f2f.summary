@entity0 -- before sunday 's elections in @entity6 , @entity2 , president of the region 's parliament , promised a referendum on independence for one of @entity11 's most important regions if he won re-election			2
but after the election , @entity13 has a more difficult task because his center - right @entity17 coalition lost 12 of its 62 seats , a strong setback for a party that was hoping to gain a simple majority in the 135 - seat legislative body			1
the @entity21 was the big winner in the elections , winning 21 seats , according to the @entity6 elections web site , which reported 98 % of the votes had been counted			1
the @entity21 also backs independence , and the two parties could form a majority in parliament on the independence issue			1
they , however , differ on most other issues , especially economic policy			2
voters in @entity6 , the most powerful economically of @entity11 's 17 regions , heeded the call that these would be historic elections , even if independence was n't on the ballot sunday			2
they voted during a deep economic crisis in the eurozone countries , especially in @entity11 and in @entity6			2
voter turnout was the highest in 24 years for @entity48 elections , officials said			1
the @entity11 government in @entity0 vows to block any self - determination referendum , arguing that the constitution does not permit a region alone to decide its independence			0
last september 11 , an estimated 1.5 million people -- 20 % of @entity6 's population -- filled the streets of @entity57 , the @entity48 capital and @entity11 's second - largest city , demanding independence			1
soon after , @entity2 called snap regional elections , two years early			0
his government already has enacted deep spending cuts trying to balance the regional books and has asked @entity0 for $ 6 billion in emergency credit to pay its bills			0
" the crisis has made many people in @entity6 desperate , " said @entity67 , a @entity68 economist			0
" they see a dark future			0
then hope springs , that with @entity48 independence , things will be better			1
" @entity6 has its own flag and language -- @entity48 -- and various analysts say the economic crisis has brought long - simmering nationalist sentiment to the forefront			1
catalans complain of cultural repression and economic sleights by @entity0 dating back centuries			1
with just 16 % of @entity11 's population , @entity6 produces 19 % of the nation 's wealth			0
@entity6 argues that it sends far more in taxes to @entity0 than it gets back in central government spending , and that @entity48 taxes help support poorer @entity11 regions			2
the regions administer key public services such as health and education , and in @entity6 's case , also the police and prisons			0
in addition to @entity13 ' party , three other major parties will be closely watched as potential power brokers in the new parliament			0
the @entity21 doubled its bloc , as it held just 10 seats before the election			0
the @entity48 branches of @entity11 's ruling conservative @entity109 -- which opposes independence -- gained one seat , for a total 19 in the new parliament			1
the main opposition @entity112 , which urges a federalist system for the regions , will be the biggest loser , dropping eight seats to 20 representatives			0
a survey earlier this month by the @entity48 government 's polling center showed 57 % of @entity48 would vote for independence , a 6 % increase from last june and a 14 % increase from a year and a half ago .			1

ruling party had hoped to win enough seats for simple majority
another party that supports independence makes big gains
more than a million @entity48 demonstrated for independence in september
