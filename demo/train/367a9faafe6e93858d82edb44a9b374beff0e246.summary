-- less than a day after officially concluding 12 tumultuous years as mayor , @entity1 sat stone - faced in the front row at the inauguration of his liberal successor , mayor @entity5 , as one speaker after another made blistering , thinly veiled attacks on @entity10 's legacy			1
the rev. @entity11 , one of the clergymen who delivered the opening invocation , asked @entity14 to turn " the plantation called @entity17 " into a better place			0
actor @entity18 used his turn at the podium to call for an end to what he called the city 's " deeply dickensian justice system			2
" and the newly elected public advocate , @entity25 , ticked off a litany of criticisms of @entity10 's police , education and economic policies			2
the attacks , which dominated an inauguration ceremony that is normally a celebration of municipal unity , jarred many observers			2
" as outside observer , hard to understand the bitter partisanship at @entity41 ceremony , " noted an @entity36 journalist on @entity37			1
" there 's a time for everything , and this is n't it			2
" things got so heated that , an hour into the event , former president @entity47 , who administered the oath of office to @entity5 , tried to reset the tone by offering the first praise of @entity10 , noting that the departing mayor " leaves the city stronger and healthier than he found it			0
" @entity41 himself departed from his prepared speech to ask the crowd to applaud @entity10			1
the criticism was partly a matter of political overreach : polls suggest that a majority of @entity17 , while ready to turn the page on the @entity10 years , also think the city is on the right track			1
forty - nine percent approve of what @entity10 did for the city , including innovative programs aimed at low - income residents			0
but over the years , @entity10 -- a @entity73 veteran and a multibillionaire with a chilly managerial style -- became an irresistible target for those who decry the gap between rich and poor			0
at a time when homelessness in @entity17 has soared to a record - high 50,000 people ( @entity86 ) sleeping in city shelters every night , @entity10 's habit of jetting off to a home in @entity81 on weekends was fodder for criticism from opponents			0
the same was true of @entity10 's free - spending ways : one conservative estimate places @entity10 's spending on his campaigns and other political efforts at an eye - popping $ 650 million from his personal fortune , overwhelming liberal @entity100 challengers in 2001 , 2005 and 2009			1
it was easy for liberal politicians to point the finger at @entity10 as a symbol of inequality , but as @entity5 will soon discover , the issue wo n't vanish with the @entity1 administration			1
@entity109 business correspondent @entity108 has wisely suggested that progressives not get too giddy over what the @entity112 equality agenda can deliver in the foreseeable future			0
" everyone should take a deep breath or two , " he wrote in august			0
" economic inequality is a serious issue and municipal governance is a serious matter , but the fact is that the two have relatively little to do with each other			1
" poverty has bedeviled @entity17 and other cities for centuries , and mayors have scant power to affect broad trends like the decline of manufacturing , the loss of low - skilled jobs to foreign countries and the destruction of jobs by automation and the information revolution			0
but @entity17 's newly - elected mayor won last november on a campaign promise to use the power of government to attack yawning gaps of wealth and income between rich and poor			1
even before taking office on @entity147 , @entity5 began ratcheting up the rhetoric , explicitly positioning his new administration as a place the rest of the nation should watch for clues about how to address economic inequality			1
on wednesday he told the inauguration crowd , " we are called to put an end to economic and social inequalities that threaten to unravel the city we love			0
" a large audience will indeed be watching to see whether @entity5 -- or any mayor -- can make the mighty wheels of the national economy spin in the direction of uplifting the poor			1
if he can crack the code , an effective attack on economic inequality will be making news long after the ungracious sendoff of @entity10 has faded from memory			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			2

@entity175 says speakers at inauguration of @entity179 *slammed* his *predecessor*
it was partly as political overreach on issue of inequality , *implicating* @entity1 , he says
but *solving* inequality not so easy , relies on factors largely out of a mayor 's reach , he says
louis : @entity41 promises to reverse inequality ; nation will indeed be watching to see how
