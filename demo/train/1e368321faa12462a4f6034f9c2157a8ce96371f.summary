@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 voters are going to the polls again friday -- to vote on a treaty they rejected just over a year ago			1
prime minister @entity6 gets out the ' vote yes ' message in @entity9			2
but this time round , opinion polls indicate the " yes " campaign to adopt the @entity12 and its rules for governing an expanded @entity14 will be successful			1
the @entity14 has made assurances to @entity1 that the @entity12 will not affect the country 's abortion laws or its neutrality and that @entity1 will keep a @entity20 commissioner			1
in the weeks leading up to the vote , @entity0 was awash with posters for both sides of the emotional argument			2
" yes " posters reminded voters how much @entity1 has benefited financially from being inside the @entity14			1
" no " placards questioned whether @entity1 will lose its military neutrality , its anti-abortion laws and its minimum wage despite the @entity14 assurances			1
just more than half -- 53 percent -- of @entity1 voters said " no " to the @entity12 in june 2008 , throwing the future structure of the @entity14 into doubt as all member states have to ratify the treaty before it can be adopted			1
@entity36 is the plan to modernize the @entity14 's structure after it expanded to 27 members , with most of the new member states coming from @entity41			1
@entity1 has just one percent of the @entity14 's population but its " no " vote effectively stopped adoption of the @entity12 across the continent			1
so , the @entity0 government is holding another referendum friday in the hope of this time getting a " yes " vote			1
no other @entity14 citizens have been allowed to vote on the treaty as national parliaments have ratified the treaty			1
and to date only @entity56 and the @entity57 governments have held up the final passage of the treaty in their own countries			0
but @entity1 's constitution mandates citizens must be allowed to vote on any major changes to its own governmental structure			1
a handful of @entity0 taxi drivers told @entity2 they would vote no because they see no reason to give to @entity67 the powers that @entity1 fought hard to wrestle away from @entity69			1
" no " campaigner @entity74 , from a group called @entity76 , put it bluntly : " people having had experience of benign @entity69 presence do n't want to be going fighting @entity69 's wars , or anybody else 's			0
" but the " no " campaign is a rag bag of groups that have little in common			0
@entity74 says he is pro-europe but does not want @entity1 tax money to pay for @entity41 's military structure			1
to illustrate the diverging political viewpoints in the " no " campaign , @entity74 was not happy that the @entity85 was in @entity0 and on his side			0
@entity85 is an @entity87 , @entity69 party and it finds itself on the same side as @entity89 , the @entity90 , nationalist party			0
conservative anti-abortion catholic groups also press the " no " case			0
" when i see the @entity69 @entity85 join up with @entity89 and religious extremists , i must be on the right side , " laughed @entity93 , a " yes " campaigner			0
he said he volunteered to hand out leaflets because he says last year the @entity98 lobby took a " yes " for granted			0
he says by talking about what is actually in the treaty -- a document most people last time round admitted they had not read -- he has changed minds			1
" i have met a lot of people on the campaign who voted no the last time			2
voted no out of anger , voted no because of the arrogance of politicians who put their faces on the posters when the issue was n't about , say , local elections , " @entity93 said			0
" a lot of people have changed their mind and i think they should be given that opportunity " by getting to vote a second time			2
but @entity1 is going through one of the worst recessions of any developed nation since the 1930s			2
there are no green shoots on the emerald island			0
property prices have collapsed , unemployment doubled in a year and for the first time in nearly 20 years , emigration is back			0
the government is very unpopular and the business community worries this will influence voting			0
" the biggest concern is that it will be a " no " on the basis of people 's anger about domestic policy issues rather than the treaty itself , " says @entity137 , of the @entity138			0
business is at the fore of the " yes " vote this time around			2
at the @entity151 tech giant @entity149 , @entity150 , its general manager of @entity1 , said he had to persuade his boss this vote was critical			1
" i had to go and convince the @entity149 , " he said			0
" and quite frankly @entity154 , when i spoke to him , the ceo , was n't that particularly interested in the issues			0
i convinced him that it was good for @entity1 and good for our business in @entity1			2
" results are not expected until saturday .			0

@entity1 votes on treaty covering expansion of @entity14
voters rejected treaty in 2008 but have new @entity14 assurances this time
a ' no ' vote would delay , and *possibly* kill , *implementation* of the treaty @entity14 - wide
opinion polls indicate the ' yes ' campaign will succeed this time
