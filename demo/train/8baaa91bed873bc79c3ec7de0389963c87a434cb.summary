@entity1 railway experts have begun talks on building a record - breaking high - speed rail that would connect @entity5 in the north to @entity7 in the south			1
according to the @entity10 , the proposed line will operate at a speed of 350 kilometers per hour ( 217 mph )			0
beginning in @entity5 's @entity15 city and running through southern @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , its final stop would be in @entity14 on @entity7 , @entity1 's southernmost province			2
though the exact length of the proposed route has not been released , it will likely become the world 's longest high - speed rail line -- smashing a record already held by @entity1 -- as the journey by road between @entity15 and @entity14 is approximately 3,000 kilometers ( 1,864 miles ) long			1
currently , the world 's longest high - speed rail line is almost 2,300 kilometers long ( 1,429 miles ) , running from @entity30 to the southern metropolis of @entity32			1
the proposed rail is part of @entity1 's aim to create a " @entity36 of the @entity37 " and coincides with initiatives to improve the country 's comprehensive transportation network while driving land development and urbanization in seven provincial areas			2
minority issues many of the provinces through which the high - speed trains will travel are near major bodies of water , such as the @entity50 in @entity5 and @entity16 provinces , the @entity52 in @entity17 and the @entity53 , where the line would end			1
it will also take passengers to popular tourist destinations including @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and minority areas in western @entity18 and @entity17			0
" the country is now shifting its focus and investing in the western regions and economically underdeveloped areas , making up for @entity1 's long debt to these areas , " @entity62 , professor of the @entity63 at @entity64 , told local media			0
" the project will significantly narrow regional disparities and solve minority issues			0
" however , @entity75 , director of @entity76 , said that if the north - to - south railway is to go ahead , there needs to be a sound ecological program in place to ensure the protection of these underdeveloped and ecologically sensitive areas			0
officials say the line will connect with existing high - speed routes such as @entity85 , @entity87 - @entity86 , @entity87 - @entity88 and @entity32			1
proposal participants say they will push for the train project to be included in @entity1 's 13th five - year national development plan ( 2016 - 2020 ) .			0

proposed high - speed rail would connect @entity5 with @entity7 , which are more than 3,000 kilometers apart
@entity96 's longest high - speed rail line is almost 2,300 kilometers long , connecting @entity30 and @entity32
@entity98 would open access to some of @entity1 's *remotest* areas for tourists
