-- magnets : how do they work ? differently on the new ipad than on the @entity4 2 , it has emerged -- and that 's bad news for anyone with an old or third - party smart cover			1
a number of users who bought new @entity12 over the weekend ( this reporter included ) were dismayed to discover that the smart covers they 'd bought for the @entity4 did n't work on the new model			1
smart covers , which attach to the @entity4 's built - in magnets , are supposed to turn the tablet on automatically when you flip them open			2
but as dozens of @entity4 users in this @entity24 forum concurred , that was no longer the case with many smart covers on the new @entity4			1
that seemed odd , as the new @entity4 is physically no different from the ipad 2 -- on the surface , at least			0
but it turns out @entity24 has been messing with the polarity of its magnets under the hood			0
photographer @entity34 uncovered this when he did some experiments with magnets , @entity12 and a couple of smart covers			0
you can see the results in a video on @entity34 's blog			0
" the @entity4 2â € ²s sleep / wake sensor was n't polarity specific , " @entity34 explains			1
and that apparently led to an issue for @entity4 2 users who flipped their smart covers around so that they sat flush with the back of the tablet -- an everyday act that could cause the @entity4 2 to switch off unintentionally			1
so it seems the new @entity4 's sleep / wake sensor does require a specific polarity			1
but in fixing one issue , @entity24 appears to have caused another for users who want to use their old smart covers with their new tablets			2
( we 've asked @entity24 to comment , and will update you if we hear back			0
) @entity34 theorizes that @entity24 quietly made the polarity change in their smart covers at some point in 2011 , since newer @entity24 - made smart covers do seem to work with the new @entity4			1
if you got yours for the holidays , there 's a good chance you wo n't see a problem			0
if your smart cover hails from early 2011 , try taking it back to the @entity73 ; @entity34 says he 's hearing from users that the store will exchange old smart covers for new ones			1
owners of third - party smart covers , however -- such as the beautiful wood covers from @entity83 -- appear to be out of luck			0
and it may not simply be a case of having to turn the new tablet on manually			0
in tests using my @entity89 as a stand -- the other purpose of the smart cover -- the new @entity4 's screen was plagued by fuzzy electronic lines and flashing artifacts			2
do you own a smart cover and a new @entity4 ? have you noticed this issue ? let us know in the comments			2

users say that magnetic smart covers for the @entity4 are n't working on the new model
the reason ? the sleep / wake sensor is n't polarity specific
if your smart cover hails from early 2011 , try taking it back to the @entity24 store
