@entity0 , @entity1 -- whether inside or outside the @entity5 where singer @entity6 died saturday afternoon , the grief and shock were the same			1
they were just expressed differently -- by the famous indoors and by the everyday fan outdoors			2
inside the hotel that occupies a full block , the music industry 's biggest names gathered in elegant attire for an annual pre-grammy party that had been long planned by @entity6 's mentor , @entity16			1
but a party just did n't seem right , participants said as they walked down the red carpet			2
some , like songwriter @entity20 , thought twice about attending a gala at the same hotel where 48 - year - old @entity6 died in her room just hours earlier			1
" we debated whether to come tonight and we realized it was going to continue and it was going to be a memorial , " @entity20 said			0
" it 's just shocking , " he said of the death			1
when the party started , legend @entity31 listed the names of great entertainments who recently died : @entity36 , @entity37 , and now " the magnificent @entity6 , " he said			1
@entity31 then made a well - understood reference to @entity6 's past problems with drugs , and he called on " everyone to get our government to legalize drugs " so persons do n't have to get it from " gangs " under the table , he said			1
the country needs to " legalize drugs like they did in @entity51 , " @entity31 added			1
he then sang " @entity55 " and received a standing ovation with the last line : " hope the music never ends			0
" @entity16 opened his remarks about the " unspeakably tragic news of our beloved @entity6 's passing			1
" @entity16 has long hosted a party the day before the @entity61 , the music industry 's most celebrated event			1
" i do have a heavy heart , and i am personally devastated by someone so close to me for so many years , " @entity16 told the gathering of artists and entertainers			2
" my heart goes out to her daughter @entity70 and her mother , @entity72 , " @entity16 said			0
@entity6 's mentor then asked for a moment of silence , saying , " we dedicate this evening to her			1
" outside , as a coastal chill settled over people who gathered until the small hours of sunday morning , fans and media flocked to two places : the front and back entrances of the sprawling hotel complex			2
in between , they laid roses and flickering candles			0
at the front entrance , a @entity0 police officer pushed back mourners and journalists from the entryway and said that they had to stand on the public sidewalk , pointing to the line dividing public space and private property			2
many of the 100 persons carried the flame of a candle			0
singing accompanied the vigil , including such @entity6 standards as " @entity103			2
" one singer , @entity104 , who met @entity6 once about 10 years ago , started singing " @entity105 " in memory of @entity6			2
mourners , as well as journalists , immediately started recording video of the sidewalk performance on their cameras or smart phones			0
@entity104 remarked how @entity6 struggled with drug problems			2
" pain -- they 're carrying a lot of pain , " @entity104 said about @entity6 's drug woes			1
" it could be relationships from the past			0
all we can say is that she 's at peace now			0
" then @entity104 added , remembering that @entity6 has a teenaged daughter : " there 's a teenager out here who 's lost her mother			1
" but it was at the back of the hotel -- at the service entrance -- where the largest group of fans , mourners , media and paparazzi gathered			2
about 200 persons assembled on the ficus - tree - lined sidewalk			0
everyone was waiting for whether @entity6 's body was going to taken away by authorities through the service door			1
a police vehicle marked " @entity153 " was parked at the door , also joined by a large truck marked " rental " -- which conveniently shielded off spectators from the best view of the entrance			0
the rear door was also being used by artists such as @entity31 and @entity156 attending @entity16 ' party			1
the entertainers apparently were seeking to avoid the public , but it hardly worked saturday night			0
at one point , a woman in the crowd shouted : " @entity164 ! " as singer @entity164 walked by			0
paparazzi and fans with cameras pushed the hardest to get to the front of the line , where the public sidewalk met the private driveway			0
keys entered the back of the hotel , and then the pack of spectators eased and resumed friendly conversation in the cool night air beside the seven - foot tall bushes			0
some fans wept , as they played @entity6 's music videos on their smartphones			1
one fan , @entity184 , 31 , just had to stop by the hotel , even tough she , her girlfriend and @entity184 's daughter should have been making the two - hour drive back home to @entity189			1
@entity184 's daughter , @entity191 , turned 11 years old on saturday , and the group of three drove to @entity193 to do some shopping and have a celebratory dinner for @entity191 's birthday			0
it was also a celebration of @entity184 's 31st birthday on friday			0
but when @entity184 's girlfriend , @entity201 , 26 , received a phone call from her father saying that @entity6 had died , none of the three could believe it			1
@entity184 thought it was another @entity205 rumor of a celebrity 's death , and she used her phone to check it out the information			2
she found that @entity6 had indeed died -- at the @entity5			1
the day become a birthday that @entity191 will never forget , she said			0
so the two women and girl visited the hotel -- and decided to join the crowd at the back door , wondering when the coroner or police would remove @entity6 's body			1
" we just wanted to come by and show some support , " @entity184 said under a towering ficus tree by the rear driveway			0
" it 's just so sad , " she added			0
then she referred to @entity6 's history of drug abuse			1
" everyone has their own demons , and some overcome them and some never do , " @entity184 stated			0
" sometimes life gets the best of us			0

inside the @entity5 , entertainers hold a long planned pre-grammy party
@entity31 says it 's time to " legalize drugs like they did in @entity51 "
outside the hotel , mourners gather to sing @entity6 's songs
" sometimes life gets the best of us , " one fan says of @entity6 's early death
