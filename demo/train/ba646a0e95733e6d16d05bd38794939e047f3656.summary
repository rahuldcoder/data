-- @entity1 is puzzling about how to fit a windshield			2
his problem is not installing it in a car , but hanging the glass in thin air and keeping it hovering for a prolonged display			2
this is a fairly typical challenge for the @entity11 engineer , who along with his daughter @entity12 runs @entity13 , a leading levitation design firm			1
the mysterious art of floating has been largely confined to ultra-specialist industry applications and magician tricks , but the @entity19 have developed a repertoire for any occasion ; from lifting a model 's top hat for a fashion shoot to a giant rock in a striking art display			2
they have given sneakers air for @entity29 , and produced a range of self - suspending lamps for the home			1
these are all given flight by patented modules that induce magnetic levitation			1
the kit is comprised of two parts : a magnetic disc that can be integrated into the chosen object , and a base containing sensors that pin it in space			1
the latest and most heavy - duty module can support up to 10 kilograms to a height of nine centimeters , but bespoke services are available for unlimited height and weight			2
" our customers drive us by requesting more demanding solutions , " says @entity1			2
" for the higher and heavier loads we have to combine the largest levitation modules			1
" the company is also developing programming to make the magnets smarter , more responsive and capable of more sophisticated movement			2
" people do n't want something to just float but also to interact with it			2
what should happen then is that sensors around the object move depending on the movement of people , so the object is more intelligent			2
" @entity1 is flooded with requests to make every conceivable item levitate			2
one popular option for illusionists and thrill - seekers is to make a human float , which he is pursuing with some reservations			0
" you could have magnets inserted into clothes but it would not feel like resting on the clouds ... if you have these magnets working together it 's a giant force			1
it can hurt the skin			0
there need to be safety precautions			0
" the @entity87 chair , an invisible chair that you can wear the @entity19 are not alone as there is a growing market of levitating applications for consumers			0
a @entity95 company has released a set of floating speakers , promising a unique experience for the listener			0
@entity101 designers have produced a computer mouse buoyed by magnetic levitation , designed to alleviate carpal tunnel syndrome			1
but the limiting factor of magnetic levitation is requiring a base to float over , effectively requiring that objects are stationary			1
this largely puts paid to the hoverboard dream inspired by " @entity111 " -- another of the @entity19 ' most common requests -- and explains why transport seems the best placed industry to make use of the technique			0
until recently , " @entity119 " trains were expected to revolutionize public transport , promising increased speeds over 300mph			1
but the high cost and energy consumption has slowed their growth and today only @entity126 and @entity127 operate such a system			1
that could change with the advent of superconductor - powered vehicles , able to generate greater magnetic force with lower power consumption			1
high concept projects such as @entity126 's ' @entity119 ' would use this system for supersonic transport , and it could even support space missions			0
dr. @entity138 of @entity139 works with maglev vehicles and feels superconduction offers significant advantages			1
" it gives you much more freedom			0
the energy storage is more efficient , and there are no moving parts			0
it can be extremely fast with frictionless motion			0
" @entity151 has developed his own superconducting levitating vehicle -- the " @entity155 , " a lightweight buggy that hovers above tracks , held in place with a self - stabilizing mechanism			0
he imagines it being used for rapid transfers in airports , although one research area looks at creating routes and vehicles for private use			1
the spaceship reinvented for new frontiers the applications from superconductors need not be limited to transport , says @entity151			0
he has consulted on projects to float a 60 - ton stage , and to enhance gravity in space , among other ambitious plans			0
another levitation breakthrough has come at the micro level , and by a different method			1
this year , @entity127 scientists used acoustic levitation to manipulate small objects with three - dimensional capability for the first time			1
researchers created a " moveable ultrasonic focal point " that allowed them unprecedented control with sound waves			0
experts hailed the potential impact for molecular analysis for chemistry and medicine , but lead researcher @entity196 of the @entity197 also foresees wider applications : " i would like to draw huge levitated graphics in stadiums or concerts , " he said			0
" or for use in our daily lives such as floating interactions at home and small object levitation			1
" in many cases , levitation technologies have yet to find meaningful functions , either serving novelty purposes or yet to break out of the research stage			1
but the possibilities are multiplying , and the applications are becoming established in fields such as entertainment and transport			0
if the spread continues , magicians may need to learn some new tricks			0
the @entity87 chair , an invisible chair that you can wear the spaceship reinvented for new frontiers lighting on the wall : @entity228 's most spectacular video projections			0

new technology makes levitation a *reality* for home *furnishings* , vehicles , and ... rocks ?
magnetic levitation technology is already allowing @entity127 trains to travel at over *500km/h*
advances in superconduction could soon take maglev technology to the next level
