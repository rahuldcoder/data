@entity12 champion @entity11 pocketed $ 1.3 million for the tournament , the same as male winner @entity15			2
it may be two years since @entity17 and the @entity18 joined the other major tournaments in offering women the same cash prize as men , but for some tennis fans the issue is far from resolved			1
" admit it sisters , " screamed one recent headline on @entity28 web site @entity26 , " this is not equal			0
" the author went on : " political correctness , sexual equality and feminism all prevent many commentators from stating the bleeding obvious ... no sports watcher in their right minds could honestly say female tennis players , or golfers for that matter , deserve as much money as their male counterparts			1
" the writer -- a woman -- went on to lambaste the world 's best female tennis players , describing world number one @entity11 ' defeat of @entity46 in the @entity12 final as " embarrassing , pitiful and pathetic			1
" " her humiliation of @entity46 was a terrible advertisement for a sport that has apparently disappeared up its own backside			2
" rather than provoking a tirade of abuse , many readers agreed with the author , outspoken @entity28 journalist and sports commentator , @entity57			0
" right on the money			0
women 's tennis is boring			1
@entity64 , " one said			0
another added : " it 's about time someone said what everyone was thinking			0
" more chimed in : " everyone agrees , few will say it " and " totally agree			0
women 's tennis is pathetic			1
" a couple of dissenters in the crowd urged @entity76 to turn her attentions elsewhere : " the usual tripe that @entity76 dishes up week after week , " and " please go away and let someone with something important to say use your space			0
" what do you think ? do women deserve equal prize money in tennis ? sound off below			1
@entity89 has heard it all before			0
the former world number one has spent a good part of the last forty years campaigning for equal prize money , and equal status , for women			1
the decision by the @entity96 and @entity97 in february 2007 , and then the @entity18 one day later , to award equal prize money to women marked the end of a fight that started in 1968 , the first year of @entity12 tennis			1
" when @entity103 won @entity17 , he got £ 2,000			2
and when i won @entity17 in the same year , 1968 , i got £ 750 , " she told @entity2 in an interview filmed for this month 's edition of " revealed			2
" " i knew then that was going to be one of our next battles that we would have to fight over the years , " she added			0
@entity89 hoped to put the matter to rest in 1973 when she took on self - proclaimed male chauvinist @entity113 in now famous match known as " @entity115			0
" @entity113 , a former men 's number one , claimed the women 's game was so poor that even he , as a 55 - year - old retiree from the sport , could beat the top female players			2
@entity89 accepted the challenge and thrashed @entity113 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 in front of a television audience of millions			0
those who argue for lower pay for women 's tennis say they play fewer sets and attract a smaller television audience so they should receive less money			1
campaigners for equal pay say that it 's not an issue of time on the court , but an matter of fair and equal treatment as current world number six @entity148 once argued in an open letter published in @entity151 , " we enjoy huge and equal celebrity and are paid for the value we deliver to broadcasters and spectators , not the amount of time we spend on the stage			2
