@entity0 -- come the first tuesday in november , when millions are streaming into polling stations across the country , as much as 40 % of @entity5 will have already voted			1
in 2004 , 22 % of @entity5 voted early and that rate rose to 34 % in 2008 , according to @entity7 , professor of political science who founded and runs the @entity10 at @entity11 in @entity12			1
not only is early voting changing the way @entity5 cast their ballot but it 's also changing the way candidates run their campaigns			1
" people find it much easier if they can choose the time to vote ... rather than show up on one day of the week , " said @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , commissioner of elections and the county 's voting auditor			0
@entity19 said early voting is insurance against the expected -- finals at the @entity31 or an out - of - town business trip -- or the unexpected , like a sick child			1
@entity20 , home to 130,000 residents , is on pace with its 2008 early voting requests by mail when about 55 % of the county voted early			1
@entity21 begins early voting on september 27 , almost a week before the first debate on october 3			1
@entity40 and @entity41 are the first states to start voting with ballots being cast on friday			2
depending on state law , early voting can either be done in - person , through the mail or through an absentee ballot			1
some states require an excuse for absentee voting while others are moving toward no - excuse absentee balloting			2
military personnel are able to vote by email			0
while early voting has changed the times when voters hit the polls , it has also changed the cycle by which campaigns try to influence voters			1
voting days are upon us the @entity64 -- " the really stinky piece of information that campaigns hold on to until the end of the election , " as @entity69 , an associate professor at @entity70 who specializes in @entity5 elections , puts it -- will have to be a september surprise to have much effect			1
by october , he said , it could be too late for that kind of information to influence the election			0
and @entity81 's successful 72 - hour voter turnout program from 2002 and 2004 , which used a grassroots network to push voters to the polls three days before @entity85 , would come too late now			1
" [ early voting has ] changed our voter contact program , " said @entity86 , spokeswoman for the @entity87			1
" we 're actually moving from our identification phase into our early vote , absentee ballot program earlier			2
that means every -- direct mail advertising -- everything moves up depending where [ the state is ] on the calendar			0
" some @entity100 backers still frustrated with state of campaign @entity103 say they are using early voting to combat the large influx of super pac dollars in this election , of which @entity107 have raised more			1
" while @entity100 and his allies are counting on big ad buys ... we 've made early investments in battleground states -- where we 've been registering folks and keeping an open conversation going with undecided voters for months -- to build an historic grassroots organization that will pay off when the votes are counted , " @entity109 campaign spokesman @entity108 said			2
and campaigns can better focus those efforts on who has n't voted ahead of @entity85			2
" by encouraging our supporters to vote early , we can focus our resources more efficiently on @entity85 to make sure those less likely to vote get out to the polls , " said @entity108			0
and once voters cast their ballots , campaigns may contact them again to volunteer , helping with the turnout effort in the last days of the election campaign			1
despite @entity109 cash haul , @entity107 sees big month over @entity103 while voters are taking advantage of early voting more and more , the impact on turnout is mixed and can cost governments more			1
in @entity139 , @entity12 , which begins voting on october 8 , @entity137 , spokesman for the county elections division , says that early voting and the state 's 100 % vote - by - mail has increased voter participation			1
" it does increase voter participation , especially in special elections , " @entity137 said			0
he noted the impact , for instance , on school district elections , which are n't as high profile as presidential contests			0
in @entity152 , which relies heavily on ballots mailed to people on an active voter roster , their system increases voting among people already on the list			0
but " it does n't get any new faces out to vote , " said @entity159 , spokesman for the @entity152 secretary of state			0
@entity152 will begin its early voting in october 22			1
@entity165 of the @entity166 said the impact on turnout depends on who you ask			0
" the consensus seems to be ... that it 's not increasing voter turnout , " said @entity165			0
" the people that vote already are also using early voting			2
" @entity109 holds advantage in three swing states and it 's not cutting costs			0
@entity19 said early voting increases the cost of elections , noting that expenses are spread out over a longer time period			1
early voting requires states to staff polling locations for weeks at a time and to maintain and secure the polling machines			2
" all of that costs money and is logistically not simple , " said @entity165			0
but oddly enough , logistics are exactly what resurrected early voting from its pre- 1845 days when @entity191 declared , " the tuesday next after the first monday in november " as @entity85			2
modern early voting began in the @entity193 , which has a history of complicated ballots , @entity7 said			1
" [ because of the initiatives and referenda ] you could have a really long ballot and it would take 10 , 12 , 15 minutes to type it all in and make sure it 's correct , " said @entity159			0
" for a while there , it was just a matter of getting people out of the door [ of the polling stations ]			0
" the time - consuming voting overwhelmed polling centers on @entity85 and left legislators looking for relief			0
sending out mail ballots early not only allowed @entity152 voters to read through the sometimes lengthy ballots and send them back at their leisure , @entity159 said			2
it also took pressure off swamped polling centers			0
but mail ballots can increase the chance of ballots not being counted if voters do n't follow procedures carefully			0
improperly filling out a ballot is " the number one way people disenfranchise themselves , " @entity69 said			0
in 2008 , more than 400,000 absentee ballots were thrown out nationwide , according to data from the @entity229 and @entity230			1
even though that 's less than 1 % of the ballots cast nationwide , @entity69 said that " it could make a big difference in the election			0

in 2004 , 22 % of @entity5 voted early and that rate rose to 34 % in 2008
early voting has changed the times when voters hit the polls , and changed the way campaigns run
while voters are taking advantage of early voting , impact on turnout is mixed and can cost governments more
400,000 voters were disenfranchised in 2008 because they improperly filled out their absentee ballots
