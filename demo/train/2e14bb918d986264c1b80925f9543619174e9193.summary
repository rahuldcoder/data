@entity1 , @entity0 -- two titans of showbusiness have come together in a perfect pairing : the @entity6 , the world 's greatest band , play two nights at @entity10 's intimate @entity9 ; capturing the night on camera is celebrated film director , @entity11			1
shared history , mutual respect : the @entity6 and @entity11 the result is " @entity16 , " which records @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity21 's performance at the end of " @entity23 , " their monumental two - year , record - breaking , $ 558 million , 144 - date global tour that saw 4.6 million ticket holders watch the rock giants			1
the @entity6 / @entity11 combo is backed by a team of @entity31 - winning cinematographers , more than 18 cameras , duets with the @entity35 ' @entity34 , pop starlet @entity36 and blues granddaddy @entity37 , plus a cameo from a former @entity40 president : the @entity6 juggernaut is well and truly in town			1
@entity11 is no stranger to the world of rock music			1
he cut his teeth as an editor on seminal 1970 documentary " @entity48 " and aside from making some of the silver screen 's finest movies ( " @entity51 , " " @entity52 , " " @entity53 , " " @entity54 " ) , he is also the master behind definitive rockumentaries " @entity56 , " which captured @entity58 's final performance , and @entity59 epic , " @entity61			2
" but apart from his musical collaborations , rock has underpinned many of the master 's greatest moments -- and his relationship with the @entity6 goes way back			1
the @entity6 themselves have provided the backing track for classic @entity11 scenes : notably , @entity76 's @entity75 mobster 's entrance in " @entity54 " to the thumping sound of " @entity72 " and " @entity78 " behind @entity80 's introduction in " @entity52 " ; while " @entity51 " features " @entity71 " and , again , " @entity72			1
" @entity11 , who pioneered the use of rock music on " @entity52 , " has said that his use of eclectic soundtracks stems from @entity10 , where all genres of music would blast from the brownstones around his neighborhood			1
and for him , the @entity6 provide the sound of the city , the sound of the streets : cool , dangerous , absolutely self - assured , suffused with menace and gangster swagger			2
he says , " @entity6 were key ... i was creating scenarios in my head as i listened to their music			1
" " there is a drive and an authority to their music , and also an edge to it , " he continues			0
" i 've used @entity106 twice now in my pictures			0
" ( it 's left to @entity17 to joke that @entity16 is the first @entity11 film not to feature the track			1
) so when @entity17 decided he wanted a film of their live performance , who better to call			0
" it 's good to start at the top , " he says			0
initially , guitarist @entity116 was reluctant to go ahead with the film			0
he told @entity2 , " i would n't have done this			0
they said , ' we wan na shoot a show , ' and i said , ' yeah , so ? ' " but @entity18 , a film buff and longtime fan of @entity11 's work , could n't resist the chance to be shot by the director			1
" you go , whoah , " he said			0
" you ca n't f * * * around with him			0
i wanted to see what @entity11 saw in the @entity6			1
" and @entity11 's response ? one word : " absolutely			1
" but @entity17 's idea for the movie centered around the @entity6 ' biggest ever concert , in @entity135			2
@entity11 was n't convinced that the @entity137 beach extravaganza would hit the right note			2
" i wanted to capture the music and their interaction on stage , i wanted people to feel like they were with them in the real film , " he explains			0
eventually he persuaded @entity17 to forego the @entity135 beach gig for a double date at @entity10 's @entity9			1
on the night of the performance , we see @entity11 's painstaking preparation come up against the monster of spontaneity that is the @entity6 live			1
as the clock ticks towards curtain time , the filmmaker still does n't have the final set - list , and is getting jittery			0
" it felt like the last minute			0
it may actually have been an hour or so , " he recalls			0
but as the song goes , you ca n't always get what you want : @entity11 had to place his faith in his meticulous planning , and the hope that he would be able to respond to the performers -- @entity17 especially -- on the night			2
@entity11 believes that the band 's live performances are the key to their long - lived success			1
" the way they work off of each other and off of the audience ... it 's fascinating to see that kind of power , " he explains			0
" they cast a spell , something primal but very orchestrated			0
" when it came to the edit , @entity11 ditched any thought of talking - head interviews , choosing instead to splice vintage tv / archive footage between the live shots			2
that puts the focus firmly on the music , while underlining the @entity6 ' longevity			2
so where does " @entity16 " stand in relation to other rockumentary greats ? sure enough , it 's not @entity6 : the spectacle , @entity17 's original concept			1
this is an intimate and illuminating look at the relationships in rock ' n ' roll 's greatest band			2
it pays tribute to their longevity , highlights their rich repertoire and shows how , forty years on , their live shows still crackle with energy			0
and while fans will decide whether @entity11 has fulfilled his aim to make " something that 's as close as possible to a live performance , " @entity116 believes @entity11 got the gold			1
" he captured what we do , " he told @entity2			0
" we are what we are			0
we 're a rock ' n ' roll band			0

the @entity6 and @entity11 team up for " @entity16 "
@entity224 shows their performance at @entity10 's @entity9
director says the @entity6 ' music has been a key influence in his films
@entity11 aimed to give an intimate view of the band onstage
