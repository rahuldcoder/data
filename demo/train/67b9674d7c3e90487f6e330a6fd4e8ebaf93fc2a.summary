-- @entity1 has good news for " @entity4 " fans			1
" i 'm working on the movie right now , " the show 's creator tells @entity7			1
" i ca n't get into much more detail because i do n't want to scare anybody off			1
i do n't want to be presumptuous about it			1
i do n't own the property outright -- it 's a @entity13 property			1
but everybody seems really into it and really eager to make a movie			1
" binge - watching ' @entity4 ' season four the biggest challenge that @entity1 faced when filming the fourth season last year was working around the busy schedules of the large cast			1
" a tv season is a six - month commitment , " he says			2
" but i think it would be very doable to get them together for four or five weeks to make a movie			1
" any sort of " @entity4 " movie has yet to receive a green light , so @entity1 is very reluctant to guess when it might see release			1
" i 'm hoping it happens as soon as possible , " he says			2
" but i want to be very careful about not putting out false information			2
i want to get a time and tell everybody when it 's happening and not play with people			0
right now , i 'm trying to do something else for @entity38 and a movie project and things			1
i 'm always sort of superstitious about talking about this stuff before it happens			0
it 's the best way to guarantee it does n't happen			1
" " @entity4 " returned as a @entity38 - only show in may after being off the air for seven years			1
it got a ton of media attention , but some fans and critics were disappointed by the end result			0
" i was really aware that we were trying to do something that not only had nobody done before , but we did n't really tell anybody what we were going to do , " says @entity1			1
" that is , we made an eight - and - a - half - hour show			0
so nobody had any framework to watch it from			0
" the 15 new episodes largely focused on one character at a time			0
the same scene was often shown from many different perspectives , and jokes sometimes did n't pay off for several episodes			2
@entity38 eyes another season of ' @entity4 ' " by now , many people have gone through the episodes again , " says @entity1			1
" they see the first episodes as the first chapters as opposed to the first episodes			0
people responding quickly to the first episodes was akin to reading a couple chapters of a book and saying , ' i do n't like this			2
' " some of the online reaction to the new episodes was hostile , but @entity1 steered clear of the countless reviews and recaps			1
" when we originally did the show there was a website called @entity87 , " he says			0
" i would oftentimes go there and see reactions to the previous night 's show			0
they 'd write things like , ' now they 're doing black puppets ! they 've ruined the show ! ' it does n't matter what people like now			2
the first monday after we aired on sunday , they hated it			0
and then six months later , people would say , ' why do n't they do good shows like they did with [ the black puppet ] @entity105 ? ' realistically , if you 're going to really try to do something different and confound expectations , you 're going to lose some people and gain some people			2
" ' @entity4 ' : the funniest running jokes the reaction to the new episodes reminds @entity1 of what @entity114 experienced in 2000			1
" there was a long lapse of time after they released ' @entity120 , ' " he says			0
" and then ' @entity121 ' came out and everybody was like , ' we do n't like this			2
we do n't like this			2
' and then later they came around to thinking it was even better than ' @entity120			0
' also , it 's difficult to make this comparison because it sounds self - aggrandizing and i do n't mean it that way , but i remember when ' @entity133 ' came out			1
people were like , ' what ? what is this ? i want to see ' @entity138 ' where they shoot people , not this thing where they talk about @entity142			0
' " plans are obviously in flux at the moment , but @entity1 's ultimate goal is to make an " @entity4 " movie and then another season of the show			1
" the whole thing is sort of unprecedented , " he says			0
" it 's always been its own little thing			0
i kind of feel like the more it stays original , the better chance it has			0
as soon as it goes back to trying to do exactly what it was before , you run the risk of doing a reunion show or something			0
