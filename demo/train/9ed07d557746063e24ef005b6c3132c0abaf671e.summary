the bitter fight over nominations resumes thursday as @entity3 @entity2 appear poised to try and block two of president @entity6 's appointments , possibly triggering an angry backlash from @entity8			1
one is the president 's pick to be a judge on the highly influential @entity12 in @entity13 the other is a @entity8 congressman the president wants to head the federal agency that oversees the mortgage giants @entity17 and @entity19 if @entity2 succeed in blocking the two , @entity8 might carry out a threat to change @entity3 rules over @entity2 objections , the so - called " nuclear option , " to prevent future filibusters of presidential appointees			1
senate majority leader @entity27 said wednesday he was " cautiously optimistic " @entity2 would approve @entity28 to the appeals court , which is often considered second in importance to the @entity31			1
he declined to " get into hypotheticals " before the votes take place about whether he 'd push for the rules changes			0
@entity2 aides were doubtful -- although not fully confident -- that at least five @entity2 senators would break with their party to support @entity28			1
they said sens. @entity40 of @entity41 and @entity42 of @entity43 might vote with @entity8 to break the filibuster			0
if they did , that would still leave @entity8 three votes shy of the 60 needed to break the filibuster			0
senior @entity8 aides seemed genuinely unsure of whether they would have enough votes to move @entity28 's nomination , unusual on the eve of a key vote			2
since @entity28 was chosen a few weeks ago , @entity2 have said @entity8 and the president are trying to change the balance on the court , which currently has four judges who were appointed by @entity8 presidents and four judges who were appointed by @entity2 presidents			1
while there are currently three vacancies on the 11 seat bench , @entity2 argue its workload is lighter than some other circuits and they would like to see vacancies filled elsewhere first			2
" i think we 're not going to allow that court to be stacked , " said sen. @entity67 , @entity69 - @entity68			0
" she 'd be a fine judge , just put her somewhere else			0
" " it 's clear they are trying to pack the court so they can have their judges pass legislation they can never get through the @entity78 , " said sen. @entity71 , @entity72			0
" i do n't think republicans are going to roll over on this			0
" @entity8 argue the @entity2 effort to block @entity28 is a transparent attempt to preserve conservative influence on the appeals court			1
" if this goes down , it 's just politics , " said sen. @entity85 , @entity86 , who is pushing for @entity28 's confirmation			2
" this woman is superbly qualified			0
" @entity27 has been frustrated for years about @entity2 slow - walking nominations and in the past has threatened the rules change , which @entity2 warn would destroy cooperation in the chamber			1
but he 's held back despite pressure from many members and liberal interest groups to implement the controversial new rules that would allow approval of nominees with just a 51 - vote majority			2
" the pressure to change the rules will be almost insurmountable " if @entity2 block @entity28 , sen. @entity105 , @entity106 , who chairs the @entity107 said tuesday			1
one top @entity2 leadership aide said he doubted @entity27 would change the rules			1
the aide said @entity27 also is under pressure to preserve the ability of @entity8 to filibuster the nominees of future @entity2 presidents and he would n't want to throw that away over this appointment			2
the fight over @entity28 comes as part of a broader @entity8 push this week on a series of @entity6 appointments			2
so far each of the executive branch nominees has been approved			0
but now there are doubts about @entity28 and rep. @entity125 , @entity127 - @entity126 , who the president picked to head the @entity129 , which oversees the controversial mortgage entities @entity17 and @entity131 have argued @entity125 is not independent enough and lacks the expertise to manage the complex agency			0
@entity8 @entity3 aides conceded privately that is unlikely @entity125 will get the 60 votes he needs for confirmation			0
one aide said if both @entity28 and @entity125 are defeated , rank and file @entity8 senators would be more likely to push for the nuclear option , something @entity8 leaders had not initially envisioned would be the result of this week 's voting .			1

confirmation particularly *unclear* for two presidential nominees
@entity27 " cautiously optimistic " @entity28 will be approved for @entity13 appeals court
dems may consider " nuclear option " if @entity2 senators block nominations
" nuclear option " is a rules change that would bar filibuster for presidential appointees
