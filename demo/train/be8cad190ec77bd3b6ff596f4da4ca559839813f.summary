@entity0 , @entity1 -- a jury of five men and seven women , along with four alternates , was chosen wednesday in the trial of @entity8 , the former @entity9 assistant football coach charged with child rape			1
half of the 16 jurors and alternates have ties to @entity9 , including one retired professor and one current professor , three graduates , two employees and one current student , showing the prominence of the university in the local community			1
@entity8 , 68 , has been under house arrest since being charged with sexually abusing 10 boys for at least 15 years			1
prosecutors say he met some of his accusers through @entity28 , a charity he created for underprivileged children			0
he has pleaded not guilty to the charges			0
@entity8 jury lockdown : risks vs. costs letters written by @entity8 to one of his alleged victims , identified only as @entity39 , can be described as love letters , a source familiar with the case said wednesday			1
one letter describes love between a man and a boy , the source said			0
the letters are expected to be entered into evidence during the trial , two sources with knowledge of the case said			1
however , the letters , as first reported by @entity52 , may be given a different interpretation by the defense			0
they are expected to argue that the letters and notes that @entity8 sent are benign and illustrate his love for the children he has helped over the years through @entity28 , according to a source familiar with the case who asked not to be named			1
victim 4 's attorney , @entity61 , said tuesday that he expects that letters from @entity8 to his client will be introduced at the trial , but he declined to comment on their content			1
@entity8 's ' make - believe world ' gifts that @entity8 allegedly gave to victim 4 , who is now 28 , may also be introduced as evidence by prosecutors , according to a source close to the case			1
those gifts could include golf clubs and football jerseys , a source said			0
a source close to another alleged victim , victim 1 , said that @entity81 received birthday cards and notes from @entity8 but that they were not sexually explicit in nature			1
they included statements such as " i love you " but did not contain anything overtly sexual , that source said			0
@entity90 , @entity8 's attorney , asked judge @entity91 for a continuance wednesday , saying @entity61 violated the court 's gag order			1
before a gag order was imposed in april by the judge , a source close to the case told @entity2 's @entity99 the defense would argue the letters in question were not inappropriate			2
the source said @entity8 wrote letters of encouragement over the years to dozens of young people			1
some were football players , or second mile participants , or other young people he tried to encourage to be better students			0
the source said these letters were not intended to bribe or to encourage anything sexual from the recipients			0
the source also said @entity8 would give gifts to encourage these boys to stay on track with their grades , attending class or taking part in charity functions			1
@entity90 told @entity2 's @entity99 in november 2011 that his client " cared about a lot of kids			0
" " and there are hundreds of other kids who @entity8 took to events and to whom he provided gifts , " @entity90 said			2
" what we 're saying is , that was @entity8			2
" opening statements are expected to begin monday , @entity91 said , and the trial is likely to last about three weeks			1
the prospective jurors were quizzed tuesday and wednesday about their relationships with @entity9 , local law enforcement and @entity28 , and whether they had contributed to any of those entities			1
several reported knowing @entity8 or his wife , and others said they had volunteered at @entity28			2
the seated jury includes five members with children : three women and two men			0
some jury members said their jobs require them by law to report suspected sexual abuse cases			0
they range in age from early 20s to 70s and include a @entity155 worker , a high school teacher , a retired school bus driver and a student in his junior year at @entity9 who has ties to the football team and knows some witnesses in the case			2
prosecutors plan to call more than 50 witnesses during the trial , and the defense plans to call about 100 , including @entity168 and @entity169 , coach @entity171 's son and widow ; former graduate student @entity173 ; his father , @entity91 ; and former university president @entity175 , among others			2
defense attorneys said wednesday their list will also include seven @entity8 family members			2
authorities allege that @entity8 abused some of the boys on the @entity9 campus			1
the case has shaken the university , raised questions about its response to the allegations and drawn criticism from those who claim @entity9 put its reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims			2
@entity194 and iconic head football coach @entity171 lost their jobs soon after @entity8 's arrest amid criticism that they did not adequately handle the matter when allegations involving @entity8 arose years earlier			1
@entity171 died of complications from lung cancer in january			0
@entity173 , the former graduate student , is considered to be a key witness in the @entity8 case			2
he has testified that he alerted @entity171 in 2002 that he 'd seen what appeared to be @entity8 sexually assaulting a boy in a shower in @entity9 's athletic facilities , an allegation that authorities did n't learn of until years later			1
@entity171 apparently told athletic director @entity211 , but no one notified police			0
@entity211 and @entity214 , @entity9 's senior vice president for finance and business , are now facing felony charges of perjury and failing to report the allegations to authorities			1
prosecutors said later that the @entity173 incident took place about a year earlier than was originally alleged , causing defense attorneys for @entity211 and @entity224 to argue that one of the charges should now be dropped			0
both of them have pleaded not guilty , and their attorneys have said that prosecutors " charged this case before ( they ) knew the facts			0
" the prosecution is preparing witnesses for their testimony next week , several sources close to the case said tuesday			0
victim 4 is expected to testify first , with victim 1 , who started the investigation by coming forward in 2008 and alleging years of abuse , to follow , the sources said			2
@entity173 and his father were told to be in town and ready to testify next wednesday or thursday , one of the sources said			0
@entity91 told members of the jury pool that jurors in the case will not be sequestered , saying he will trust them not to read newspapers or follow the case online			0
as jury selection in the case began tuesday , @entity9 released a statement , saying , " the acts that @entity8 is accused of committing are horrible and if proven true , deserve punishment			1
" the university said it would not comment on the specifics of the legal case but said it hopes that the trial " provides answers we are all seeking " and that " the legal process will start to bring closure to the alleged victims and families whose lives have been irrevocably impacted and that they can begin the healing process			0
" several of @entity8 's alleged victims , including @entity39 , asked a judge to protect their identities at trial			1
however , @entity91 ruled monday that the alleged victims ' identities may not be concealed during the trial , although they will be protected through the jury selection process			0
@entity2 generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault			0
in interviews after his arrest , @entity8 acknowledged showering and " horsing around " with boys but denied being sexually attracted to them			1
@entity2 's @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 , @entity2 contributor @entity288 and @entity291 's @entity290 contributed to this report .			0
