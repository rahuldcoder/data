-- if you 're genetically predisposed to be overweight , the amount of sleep you get each night could make a big difference in how influential those genes are , a new study suggests			2
after analyzing the sleep habits and body weight of 1,088 pairs of twins , including genetically identical ones , researchers concluded that people who get plenty of sleep -- at least nine hours per night -- have more control over their weight through their behavior than people who sleep less			1
among twins who slept less than seven hours per night , genes accounted for 70 % of the differences in body mass index ( @entity24 ) , while so - called environmental factors , such as diet and exercise habits , were responsible for just 4 % of the differences			1
the pattern was reversed among twins who slept nine or more hours per night			2
in this group , environmental factors accounted for 51 % of @entity24 differences and genes accounted for just 32 %			1
@entity0 : how much sleep do you really need ? getting adequate sleep , in other words , appears to dampen genetic risk and allow the influence of diet , exercise , and other controllable lifestyle factors to " surface , " the researchers say			1
" the less you sleep , the more important genetic factors are to how much you weigh , " says lead author @entity46 , @entity47 , co-director of the @entity48 , in @entity49			2
" the longer you sleep , the greater the influence of environmental factors like meal composition and timing			1
" previous research has found that too little sleep is associated with a higher @entity24 , but many of those studies have n't been able to entirely rule out the possibility that genes , or complicating factors such as sleep disorders , are partly responsible for the link			1
twin studies , by contrast , allow researchers to tease out the complex relationship between genes and environment			0
identical twins share the exact same dna , so most differences in weight can be attributed to environment rather than genes			1
and fraternal twins , though genetically dissimilar , tend to share the same background and risk factors			0
( all of the twins in the study , both identical and fraternal , were raised in the same household			0
) @entity0 : 7 tips for the best sleep ever the new study , which appears in the journal @entity86 , suggests that " the amount of sleep you get has an effect on your gene expression , " says @entity93 , @entity47 , a sleep specialist and professor of psychiatry at the @entity97 , in @entity98			0
researchers have identified more than 20 genes that are linked to obesity risk through their effects on appetite , blood sugar ( glucose ) metabolism , and other channels , but it 's not clear which specific genes were at play in the study			0
" based on previous research , it 's probably related to glucose metabolism , metabolism in general , inflammation -- all pathways that we already know are associated with obesity , " @entity46 says			0
@entity0 : surprising health benefits of sleep sleep deprivation puts stress on your body , and that stress could help explain the relationship between sleep and gene expression seen in the study , says @entity131 , @entity47 , director of the @entity132 at @entity133 , in @entity134 , @entity135			0
" when you are constantly depriving yourself of sleep , you are keeping yourself in a state of stress , and the genes that encode for that stressful environment start saying , ' i need to hold on to calories , ' " @entity131 says			0
the study does n't answer the question of whether you can " sleep yourself thin , " @entity46 says , but it does highlight the importance of adequate sleep to overall health			0
" we spend so much time in this country trying to keep our weight down with diet and exercise , but we never think about sleep , " he says			1
" i think of sleep as the third leg on the stool of good health , along with diet and exercise			2

researchers analyzed the sleep habits and body weight of 1,088 pairs of twins
genes accounted for 70 % of @entity24 differences in twins who slept less than seven hours
more sleep allows for environmental factors like exercise and diet to surface
