-- when @entity3 ceo @entity2 took the stage at the @entity5 tuesday night , he was n't just answering questions from @entity7 and @entity8 — he was also dropping hints about the future of @entity3 's product roadmap			1
sure , a lot of his answers just regurgitated the same pat , familiar themes we 've heard from @entity2 and other @entity3 executives : the @entity17 is taking the world by storm			1
the @entity20 's doing great			0
the @entity22 has been the gateway drug for a new generation of @entity3 and @entity24 users			2
but even @entity2 ca n't completely stick to the script			2
during his interview , he teased a few interesting tidbits — which we present here along with analysis on what his words actually mean			1
@entity33 should improve in the near future last week a former @entity3 employee reportedly said that former @entity3 ceo @entity37 would have " lost his mind " over @entity33 , and that employees are embarrassed by the virtual assistant			1
but luckily for @entity3 , any embarrassment should soon abate			2
" there 's more that [ @entity33 ] can do , and we have a lot of people working on this , " @entity2 said			1
" and i think you will be really pleased with some of the things you 'll see over the coming months on this			0
we have some cool ideas about what @entity33 can do			2
we have a lot going on on this			0
" clearly , @entity3 wants to evolve @entity33 , and lift its current " beta " status			1
a recent study may have found that 66 percent of @entity56 users are either " satisfied " or " very satisfied " with @entity33 , but @entity3 has still been hit with a class - action suit from users who feel @entity33 was deceptively advertised			1
in a final , non-beta version of @entity33 , @entity3 's virtual assistant would be better equipped to parse the nuances of human dialog			1
we should be able to talk to @entity33 as if she were an actual assistant			1
if a query needs clarification , she should be able to ask you much more specific questions to determine exactly what you need			0
@entity20 app misspells ' @entity69 ' to @entity71 's delight @entity33 's capabilities should also expand via new database partnerships			2
@entity74 and @entity75 @entity76 are great wealths of information , but @entity33 needs even more sources of human intelligence			2
in the original @entity83 app , you could make @entity85 restaurant reservations using @entity33			2
i would expect this and similar functionality to return			0
you should also be able to use @entity33 to post tweets , and eventually @entity91 status updates as well ( other virtual assistant apps already do this )			1
i would imagine that @entity3 will eventually open up @entity33 to third - party developers , so they could incorporate her voice recognition , dictation , and search features within their own apps , making @entity33 useful and ubiquitous system - wide			1
@entity100 worries @entity101 has loose lips @entity3 's leaving wearables to third parties do n't expect @entity3 to debut a headset or wrist - worn @entity106 any time soon			1
@entity3 has n't bought into the wearable fad , illustrated most notably by the @entity108 and @entity109			2
on the topic of wearables , @entity2 said : " i have on a @entity108			0
i think there are some cool things that can be done			0
i think it is an interesting area			0
the question is , can it change somebody 's behavior ? the book has n't been written on that yet			0
" of course , @entity3 does promote the @entity120 as a watch replacement , so it 's not like the company is completely ignoring the trend			2
but , for now , it looks like @entity3 wo n't be releasing any trendy wearable gadgets to jump on the bandwagon — and , in fact , there 's no need to			2
developing new hardware , especially in the relatively immature wearable space , takes a lot of time , money , and intellectual resources			0
so @entity3 has much more to gain by letting other manufacturers make wearable accessories — which inevitably hook into @entity3 's existing ecosystem via @entity83 apps			1
@entity3 reaps the benefit of increased @entity106 purchases and upgrades , and even takes a 30 percent cut of any paid app that a wearable computing manufacturer might sell			0
expect @entity91 - @entity3 collaboration historically , @entity3 and @entity91 have n't always seen eye - to - eye — a collaboration between @entity91 and @entity3 reportedly failed prior to the release of @entity3 's @entity153 social network , and @entity91 has since cozied up with @entity154 on its @entity156 platform			1
nonetheless , it does n't look like past conflicts are preventing @entity3 and @entity91 from working together in the future			1
" i think the relationship is very solid , " @entity2 said of @entity3 's relationship with @entity91			1
" we have great respect for them			0
i think we can do more with them			0
just stay tuned on this one			0
" just stay tuned ? @entity2 might as well just have told us , " yes , @entity91 and @entity3 are teaming up right now			1
" @entity83 already features deep @entity166 integration , and significant @entity91 integration is a glaring omission			1
it 's not a stretch to think @entity171 could yield greater @entity91 integration like what the os already provides for @entity166 ( indeed , code in an @entity176 beta hinted at just such a thing )			1
perhaps we 'll find out more during @entity3 's @entity178 in a few weeks ' time			1
or perhaps we 'll have to wait until the next @entity20 is announced , likely in october			0
whatever the case , we have to assume that @entity2 wants to see @entity91 tools integrated throughout the mobile os. @entity3 is deeply interested in the tv space @entity3 is widely rumored to be working on its own tv set , which many consumers are eager to get their hands on			1
@entity2 is still playing coy about the subject , but more than ever before it sounds like @entity3 is actively exploring the tv space			1
" this is an area of intense interest for us , " @entity2 said about the @entity189 set - top box , the company 's current living - room content solution			1
" we are going to keep pulling the string and see where this takes us			0
" could it take @entity3 to a full - fledged television set ? @entity2 would n't directly say			1
instead , he commented on @entity3 's strategy upon entering a new product area : " we would look not just at this area , but other areas , and ask , can we control the key technology ? can we make a significant contribution far beyond what others have done in this area ? can we make a product that we all want ? ... those are all the things we would ask about any new product category			1
" @entity2 did n't answer his own questions , but we can			0
can @entity3 control the key technology ? yes			0
@entity3 already dominates manufacturing in a number of overseas factories			0
it 's a master of supply - chain control			0
there should be little doubt that @entity3 can control the key technology , both on the manufacturing side , and the patents - software side			2
can @entity3 make a significant contribution to the tv space ? yes			0
through a dedicated , tv - optimized version of @entity33 and a smart @entity224 based on trademark @entity3 simplicity and aesthetics , @entity3 could advance the state of tv usability			1
can @entity3 make a tv we all want ? yes			0
as we reported above , consumers are excited by the prospect of an @entity3 - branded @entity235 television			2
come on , @entity2 ! the questions you posed are softballs			0
you 've basically announced that an @entity189 is all but inevitable			1
no more lost iphones ? " we 're going to double down on secrecy on products , " @entity2 said			0
" but , on other things — supplier responsibility , environmental issues , etc. , @entity3 will be the most transparent company			0
" in a one - year period , @entity3 reportedly lost two @entity239 : an iphone 4 prototype in the spring of 2010 that made its way onto @entity249 , and an @entity56 prototype that never made it into the public eye			2
and just this week , 9to5 @entity24 scored some images of what could be the next @entity20			0
for a company that likes to keep upcoming product information under lock and key , such mishaps are monumental			0
perhaps @entity3 will implement a new or different product testing program — one that does n't involve its beta testers drinking at bars ? joking aside , keeping multiple thousands of @entity265 workers from pulling out their own cameras and sending a few shots to the press for a quick buck would be a huge endeavor			2
@entity3 's next lines of defense might involve much more sophisticated device tagging , and elaborate sting operations , using deliberate bits of misinformation to smoke out moles who are giving up secrets			1
@entity153 's days are numbered " we tried @entity153 and i think the customer voted and said this is n't something that i want to put a lot of energy into , " @entity2 said			2
" will we kill it ? i do n't know , i 'll look at it			0
" the first day @entity153 came out , we were excited to check it out and join the music - centric social network			0
unfortunately , it just did n't stick , and @entity3 's aware of that			1
rather than make a big announcement about its demise , we 'd hazard that @entity3 will likely quietly put it to pasture some time in the next year or two			0

during a rare interview tuesday , ceo @entity2 teased a few interesting tidbits about where @entity3 may be headed
clearly , @entity3 wants to evolve voice - assistant @entity33 , and lift its current " beta " status
@entity3 's mobile operating system could yield greater @entity91 integration like it does with @entity166
@entity2 basically announced that an @entity189 is all but inevitable
