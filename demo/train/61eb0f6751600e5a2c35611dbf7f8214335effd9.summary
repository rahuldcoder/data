the book , " @entity74 , " is to be published next month by @entity75			2

@entity2 : a reporter 's storyteller " i 've done things that maybe i would n't have done in hindsight , and this maybe would have been one of them , " he said			1
" it was scarier than i thought it would be			0
i had had a bad experience in @entity108 earlier in the year , [ but ] i did feel that @entity6 was so important , and that story would n't be told otherwise , that it was worth taking risks for			0
but the repercussions of getting caught were pretty dire			0
" after several days in @entity112 , he crossed safely back across the border			0
" i do n't think i 'd ever seen something like what i saw in @entity6 , " he said			0
" you 're dealing with a government that 's shown very little restraint in killing its own people to put down an uprising			0
... and i got to spend a lot of time with [ the activists ] because i spent a lot of time in safe houses			0
and it reminded me of an old story in @entity129 history , when the @entity131 armies are crossing to @entity132			0
and the general who was leading them burned the ships after they crossed into @entity136			0
and the idea was there was no turning back			0
