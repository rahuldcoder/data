you do not want to talk to me on the phone			1
how do i know ? because i do n't want to talk to you on the phone			1
nothing personal , i just ca n't stand the thing			2
i find it intrusive and somehow presumptuous			0
it sounds off insolently whenever it chooses and expects me to drop whatever i 'm doing and , well , engage			0
with others ! when i absolutely must , i take the call , but i do n't do a very good job of concealing my displeasure			1
a close family member once offered his opinion that i exhibit the phone manners of a goat , then promptly withdrew the charge — out of fairness to goats			2
so it was with profound relief that i embraced the arrival of e-mail and , later , texting			2
they meant a conversation i could control — utterly			0
i get to say exactly what i want exactly when i want to say it			0
it consumes no more time than i want it to and , to a much greater degree than is possible with a phone call , i get to decide if it takes place at all			1
that might make me misanthropic			0
it surely makes me a crank			0
but it does n't make me unusual			2
( read about the @entity38 here			0
) the telephone call is a dying institution			1
the number of text messages sent monthly in the @entity44 exploded from 14 billion in 2000 to 188 billion in 2010 , according to a @entity46 survey , and the trend shows no signs of abating			1
not all of that growth has come out of the hide of old - fashioned phoning , but it is clearly taking a bite — particularly among the young			1
@entity44 ages 18 - 29 send and receive an average of nearly 88 text messages per day , compared to 17 phone calls			1
the numbers change as we get older , with the overall frequency of all communication declining , but even in the 65 and over group , daily texting still edges calling 4.7 to 3.8			2
in the @entity38 mobility poll , 32 % of all respondents said they 'd rather communicate by text than phone , even with people they know very well			1
this is truer still in the workplace , where communication is between colleagues who are often not friends at all			0
" no more trying to find time to call and chit - chat , " is how one poll respondent described the business appeal of texting over talking			1
the problem , of course , is what 's lost when that chit - chat goes			2
developmental psychologists studying the impact of texting worry especially about young people , not just because kids are such promiscuous users of the technology , but because their interpersonal skills — such as they are — have not yet fully formed			1
most adults were fixed social quantities when they first got their hands on a text - capable mobile device , and while their ability to have a face - to - face conversation may have eroded in recent years , it 's pretty well locked in			1
as @entity38 has reported previously , @entity101 psychologist @entity100 is one of the leading researchers looking into the effects of texting on interpersonal development			2
@entity100 believes that having a conversation with another person teaches kids to , in effect , have a conversation with themselves — to think and reason and self - reflect			2
" that particular skill is a bedrock of development , " she told me			0
@entity100 cites the texted apology — or what she calls " saying ' i 'm sorry ' and hitting send " — as a vivid example of what 's lost when we type instead of speak			2
" a full - scale apology means i know i 've hurt you , i get to see that in your eyes , " she says			1
" you get to see that i 'm uncomfortable , and with that , the compassion response kicks in			0
there are many steps and they 're all bypassed when we text			2
" when the apology takes place over the phone rather than in person , the visual cues are lost , of course , but the voice — and the sense of hurt and contrition it can convey — is preserved			1
part of the appeal of texting in these situations is that it 's less painful — but the pain is the point			0
" the complexity and messiness of human communication gets shortchanged , " @entity100 says			0
" those things are what lead to better relationships			0
" habitual texters may not only cheat their existing relationships , they can also limit their ability to form future ones since they do n't get to practice the art of interpreting nonverbal visual cues			1
there 's a reason it 's so easy to lie to small kids ( " @entity167 really , truly did bring those presents " ) and that 's because they 're functional illiterates when it comes to reading inflection and facial expressions			0
as with real reading , the ability to comprehend subtlety and complexity comes only with time and a lot of experience			0
if you do n't adequately acquire those skills , moving out into the real world of real people can actually become quite scary			1
" i talk to kids and they describe their fear of conversation , " says @entity100			0
" an 18 - year - old i interviewed recently said , ' someday , but certainly not now , i want to learn to have a conversation			1
' " adults are much less likely to be so conversation - phobic , but they do become conversation - avoidant — mostly because it 's easier			0
texting an obligatory birthday greeting means you do n't have to fake an enthusiasm you 're not really feeling			1
texting a friend to see what time a party starts means you do n't also have to ask " how are you ? " and , worse , get an answer			1
the text message is clearly here to stay and even the most zealous phone partisans do n't recommend avoiding it entirely			1
but mix it up some — maybe even throw in a little @entity198 or @entity199 so that when you finally do make a call you 're actually seeing and interacting with another person			0
too much texting , @entity100 warns , amounts to a life of " hiding in plain sight			0
" and the thing about hiding is , it keeps you entirely alone .			0

as texting use rises , the phone call is becoming a dying institution
@entity44 age 18 - 29 send an average of nearly 88 text messages a day
psychologists worry social skills in young texters wo n't develop
habitual texters may hurt relationships , miss out on new ones
