that @entity1 was one of @entity11 's leading players of the decade apparently did n't matter			2
the spectators were delivering their ultimate insult : telling him to go back to the staid version of the @entity11 domestic circuit , the @entity2			2
the crowd @entity8 attracted was different from the traditional @entity19 test cricket fan			1
they were raucous , participative and young			0
they were happy to see legends succeed , and happier to see them fail if they played for rival teams			0
the fans were united -- and partisan			2
six years after that inaugural edition , the world 's top cricket players have once again been put up for sale in the annual @entity8 auction			1
the auction is the televised sale of cricket players to @entity8 franchises through an open bidding process			1
this year 's auction is marked by rule changes which " nudge " teams into buying players from other teams rather than retain existing squads			2
the league has exploded into a brand estimated to be worth more than $ 3 billion , negotiating huge deals with tv and sponsors and getting the force of @entity11 's huge fan base behind it			1
the @entity8 's rapid rise has not been without hiccups			1
as the auction gets under way a high profile report on match fixing suggests a deep rot in @entity11 cricket overall and the @entity8 in particular			1
but , as fans debate whether even average players should be paid more than 200 times the average @entity11 's annual income for less than 20 hours of " real " work , it is worth considering how the @entity8 became such a force in world sport			1
to do that , we need to step back more than 160 years			2
in 1850 , cricket was much bigger than baseball in parts of the @entity70			1
newspapers in @entity72 and @entity73 reported cricket more often than baseball			2
the moment was right for a great @entity76 - @entity70 cricketing rivalry , but cricket then was run with a more imperial mind - set , and @entity79 's colonies and dominions such as @entity81 , @entity82 and the @entity83 were more compliant territories to establish the game			1
then @entity86 , a leading baseball pitcher of the 1870s , spotted the gap in the @entity70 market for a people 's ball game			1
he positioned baseball as a " made in @entity70 " game			1
in doing so , he relegated cricket into a colonial relic and launched a sporting empire			2
and so , for decades , @entity70 snubbed cricket			1
then , just a few years ago , the sport started morphing into something distinctly @entity70			1
in 2006 @entity99 , from sports marketing group @entity100 , and @entity101 , a scion of the @entity103 cigarette empire , realized that the game of test cricket had one problem : length			0
to be precise , five days in the sun. even the one - day game lasts more than six hours , which is about three times the attention span of young @entity11			0
@entity101 and @entity110 would have known that a shorter game would attract more fans , and began developing a proposal based on this			0
the shorter , @entity115 structure had already being trialled successfully around the world			0
each side would get only twenty overs or 120 legitimate deliveries to play			0
however the @entity120 in @entity11 ( @entity121 ) , the world 's biggest cricket " market , " resisted the new format			1
but @entity101 understood that eyeballs , not duration of game , would determine advertising revenue			0
he then single - handedly took an @entity76 game and single - mindedly americanized it for a new @entity11			1
@entity101 , a @entity70 college graduate , understood the @entity131 , the @entity132 and @entity133 , and applied his insights to the new project			2
this led to his meteoric rise in @entity11 cricket in the hierarchy , followed by a fall from grace			2
but how did he overcome resistance from @entity121 ? it was set on its path to success in 2007 , when media house @entity145 launched a rival @entity115 league , called the @entity148			0
this forced @entity121 into the arms of @entity101 as they tried to compete			0
other factors played also into the @entity8 's success , including timing			1
the league was launched just after a rookie @entity11 team unexpectedly won the @entity157 in 2007 in @entity158			0
the younger generation of fans could relate to this game and to the new stars easily			0
@entity101 's @entity8 business model was conceived using the proven @entity70 sports franchise model			1
the tactics included copying the @entity166 with the @entity8 auction , cheerleaders and plenty of timeouts for advertising			2
like the @entity172 , @entity101 embraced showbiz			0
@entity174 performed at one of the opening ceremonies			0
to this " @entity178 " mix , @entity101 added @entity179			0
for years , cinema and cricket had been the principal forms of escapism for @entity11			0
by having film stars involved in the league either as owners or ambassadors , the @entity8 was to provide a double dose of escapism at one shot			1
in another savvy move , star players were allocated to specific franchises , ensuring they were identifiably " @entity11 , " while international cricketers created a global feel			0
franchisee owners were in ferocious competition , leading to a disproportionate investment in players and marketing			0
finally , there was luck			0
in the inaugural game , @entity204 @entity203 played one of the greatest @entity115 innings , and the nation was hooked			0
the @entity8 energized cricket in @entity11			1
it is unabashedly capitalist , has brought a new generation of fans to the game and brought financial windfalls to players			0
however , like an unregulated banking industry , it is now in a race against its own inability to set and implement ground rules on ethics , codes of conduct and self - discipline			0
whether it will be remembered as cricket 's greatest party or its biggest hangover will depend on how fast the administrators can convince fans and media that the games they are watching are clean			1
meanwhile , as the @entity8 franchises compete in an open market for players this week , it is also time to reflect whether the auction is confirmation that cricket 's soul is now no longer @entity76 but @entity70			1

the @entity8 has exploded into a brand estimated to be worth more than $ 3 billion
the @entity8 's rise is in part *due* to its americanized style -- but has not been without hiccups
to understand how big the league became , one has to go back through *history*
now , it is time to reflect whether cricket 's soul is now no longer @entity76 , but @entity70
