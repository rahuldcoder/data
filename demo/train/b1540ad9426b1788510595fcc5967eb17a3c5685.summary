-- under heavy pressure from the @entity3 and allied governments , @entity1 appealed to supporters worldwide to mirror its website sunday as it continued the process of releasing thousands of sensitive @entity3 diplomatic cables			1
" @entity1 is currently under heavy attack			1
in order to make it impossible to ever fully remove @entity1 from the @entity15 , we need your help , " the site told followers sunday			1
the message was followed by instructions on how website operators could set up mirror sites that would distribute the documents as @entity1 released them			1
on the microblogging site @entity25 , supporters have rallied by offering their sites or by posting links to other mirrors			1
in an echo of " @entity31 , " the 1960 film classic about a slave revolt against ancient @entity34 , many adopted the hashtag # imwikileaks			0
" all the censoring of @entity1 is more alarming than the actual content of the leaks			1
it only further justifies @entity1 's actions , " read one widely distributed comment			1
@entity1 , which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information , began posting the first of more than 250,000 @entity45 documents last week			1
since then , the site has been hit with denial - of - service attacks , been kicked off servers in the @entity3 and @entity49 , and lost a major revenue source on friday when the @entity3 - based @entity51 cut off its account			2
@entity51 said @entity1 violated its policy against activities that " encourage , promote , facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activity			2
" and a @entity3 - based domain name provider shut down @entity1 early friday , but the controversial website announced hours later that it had employed a company in @entity60 and was back up			1
in addition , @entity62 authorities have issued an arrest warrant for the site 's founder , @entity65 , on unrelated allegations of sex crimes , including rape			1
@entity65 has denied the accusations , calling them a smear campaign			2
the @entity73 administration has condemned the disclosures , arguing that they harm @entity3 diplomacy by exposing confidential communications			0
a variety of @entity3 and @entity79 figures have called for @entity65 to be prosecuted or even killed			2
" i think the man is a high - tech terrorist , " senate minority leader @entity80 , @entity81 , told @entity84 ' " @entity83 " on sunday			1
" he has done enormous damage to our country			0
and i think he needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law			0
" but secretary of state @entity91 managed to make a joke about it at a @entity95 event saturday night			1
speaking at a dinner for the @entity98 , @entity96 praised the " full breadth and depth of @entity3 artistry and diversity , " adding , " i am writing a cable about it , which i 'm sure you 'll find soon on your closest website			2
" @entity107 , president of the @entity108 , told @entity0 's " @entity112 " that the @entity1 disclosures were " a gaffe on a large , global scale			2
" but he added , " this is not a crisis			0
it 's not a disaster			0
" " where i think it creates problems is process-wise , in terms of what people in the future will put down on paper , what people in the future will say , " he said			0
the documents released so far have featured sharp @entity3 criticism of the government of @entity130 , where an @entity3 - led coalition has been fighting @entity132 and the @entity133 since 2001 ; intense mistrust between the @entity3 and @entity135 , a nuclear - armed state where top @entity132 and @entity133 figures are believed to be in hiding ; blunt assessments of the extent of corruption in @entity141 ; and unflattering descriptions of allied leaders like @entity145 prime minister @entity144 , whom one 2009 cable described as " a complete mess			0
" the prime suspect in the disclosure is @entity150 , a @entity3 soldier now awaiting trial in a @entity153 stockade			0
@entity150 , a private first class who served as an army intelligence analyst in @entity157 , is charged with leaking video of a 2007 helicopter attack in @entity157 to @entity1 and with illegally transferring classified data			0
@entity3 officials have said @entity150 was able to access a wide variety of documents through a computer system that was set up to promote information - sharing after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity167 and @entity95			0
but @entity107 warned against an " overreaction " that will cause @entity3 agencies to share too little intelligence			0
@entity0 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
