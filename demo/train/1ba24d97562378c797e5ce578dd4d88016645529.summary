@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 triple - jump champion @entity3 knows all about putting his best foot forward			1
but in order to continue competing in the sport he loves , he 's had to go back to square one			2
retrain his muscle memory and try a new way			2
for an athlete who 's used to constantly repeating his routine , day after day , year after year , it was a big deal			2
" all my life i 've jumped from my left foot -- that was my takeoff -- and even winning the @entity20 , that was the foot i jumped from , so the idea of switching feet was pretty crazy , " the @entity15 tells @entity2 's @entity17 series			1
" you have to almost use a different side of the brain			0
my left leg was muscle memory , i could do that day in , day out , and now to do that off my right , it took a little while to get over it			0
" so why take such a big risk ? @entity3 had no choice -- triple - jumping had taken its toll on his knee joints and he was facing the prospect of having to quit in his prime ; at 22 , he was the youngest man to win the discipline 's @entity4 title in 100 years			1
" people around me would say , ' you 've won so many things , can you not continue through the pain ? ' but it was to the point that it was either that i try and blow out my knee or i just give it up , " says the 2011 world champion			1
" i love this too much -- my passion for it exceeded the doubt -- and once i just committed to it , i was like this is it			0
i 'm going to make it happen			0
" my parents always brought me up with the saying , ' where there 's a will there 's a way , ' so i was willing to do what it took and now i 'm making the way			0
" during the hard times that followed , he was able to draw on the religious beliefs instilled in him by his grandmother			0
" my faith keeps me to who i am , because a lot of times there are a lot of distractions , a lot of pressures that come with the lifestyle , " @entity3 explains			1
" but keeping that faith and just remembering who i am is very important to me			0
i have my daily devotions			0
" his persistence has paid off			0
while he finished outside the medals at last year 's world championships , finishing fourth , he has completed a hat - trick of titles in the lucrative @entity85 series			1
a season 's best leap of 17.51 meters at the @entity89 meeting in august earned the 24 - year - old the $ 40,000 jackpot as the leading men 's triple - jumper over seven events			1
@entity3 has not only overcome physical challenges , but geographical ones too			1
after he won at @entity20 , and then sealed that year 's @entity85 crown , his coach @entity97 decided he wanted to move to @entity99 to take up a new role with its national team			1
" that was very difficult because all my family was in the @entity15 my sister just got a scholarship and she moved to @entity106 and i was training in @entity107 , @entity108 ( the state where he went to university ) so we were only an hour away and that was very , very special to me that i could see her at any time , " @entity3 says			1
" but now that was all taken away from me very quickly			0
it was a big decision , but at the same time it was also an easy decision , because if you want to be the best sometimes you have to make sacrifices			0
" so i said , ' we make a special team and we 've been successful , ' and so i just had to follow him over here -- and another surprise was we were n't even in @entity0 ! " we were in @entity124 ( where @entity126 ' high - performance center is based ) and it was literally in the middle of nowhere			2
it was farmland and people spoke a little different there , so it was quite an adjustment			0
" indeed , the market town in the @entity133 of @entity1 was a long way from @entity135 , @entity136 , where his parents -- immigrants from the @entity140 island of @entity141 -- moved after @entity3 's birth in @entity143 , @entity144			1
" my childhood was the typical @entity15 story -- i played football , basketball , a lot of soccer growing up			1
my parents were taking me to karate , so i really tried it all , " he recalls			0
" they challenged me to try track and field because that 's when you start to get to the time of getting scholarships , and they said i was too talented for them to have to pay for my college			0
" the teenage @entity3 tried 100 - meter sprints , and even cross-country , but via long - jumping he discovered his true path			1
" the triple jump is a hop , skip and jump -- so it 's two hops on one leg and then one hop on the opposite leg , which takes a lot of coordination , " he says			1
" the fact i know that everyone ca n't do the triple jump makes it special for me			1
the hardest thing about it is the patience			0
" it 's such a fast - moving event , but in your head you have to slow every step down and really extend each phase to the farthest point			2
" @entity3 says the crowd plays a big part in spurring him to leap further			1
" i like to get the fans involved			0
get that encouragement and kind of feed off that energy			0
from then , you just take off and it 's 90 - 95 % full speed , " he says			2
" you have to be fast			0
you ca n't come down and jog to jump far			2
the faster you run , the further you jump			2
" in keeping with his multisport background , @entity3 is also versatile in track and field -- this season he competed in the long jump as well , setting the fifth - best leap in the @entity85 of 8.09 meters and finishing third overall			1
he has also been running 400 meters -- which he hopes may be a stepping stone to a place in the @entity15 relay team for the 2016 @entity204 , where he also plans to defend his triple - jump title			1
it all comes down to pushing himself as far as he can go -- and next on the list is the world record of 18.29m ( 60 feet ) , set by @entity99 's @entity210 in 1995			0
" i 'm at 17.96m so it 's not too far but at the same time , it 's actually very far , " @entity3 says			1
" it 's pushing myself beyond limits i do n't think i can even comprehend at this time -- it 's going to take an out - of - body experience , so i 'm pretty excited about that			2
" i would like to do it at a world championships but if it happens also in @entity222 , i wo n't say not to that , " he adds , breaking into a trademark smile			0
ultimately , @entity3 is hoping to steal some of the limelight enjoyed by @entity225 , the biggest name in athletics and arguably the most charismatic man in world sport			2
" when @entity225 walks onto the track , the lights turn on , the people are to their feet and it 's an energy like no other -- and that 's something i strive for myself , " he says			0
" i want to bring not eyes just to myself but to the triple - jump because i think right now it 's such a hard event , and i think getting that to the limelight would be pretty special			1

triple - jump star @entity3 overcomes *career* - *threatening* *injury*
knee *problems* meant he had to reverse his leaping stride , or retire early
the 24 - year - old has won @entity85 series title for third year in a row
