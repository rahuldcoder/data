the divisiveness of the abortion debate was on full display in the @entity4 statehouse monday as @entity5 , also known as the fetal pain bill , was opened to public comment by the @entity8			1
thousands began lining up early in the morning , and the testimony was expected to last more than 16 hours			2
the measure seeks to ban abortions after 20 weeks of gestation , the point at which some claim fetuses begin to feel pain			1
@entity19 state sen. @entity18 acknowledged that there are conflicting opinions in the medical community about fetal pain but remains a firm supporter of the bill			1
" are we willing to take a chance that a baby at 20 weeks can feel pain ? there was little to no middle ground in the debate			1
those in favor of abortion rights accused republicans of creating a bill based on religion rather than science			1
anti-abortion activists accuse the other side of using personal liberty to justify infanticide			2
throughout the day the committee called upon dozens of speakers , seating those with opposing views right next to each other			0
for anti-abortion activists such as lady @entity51 , the bill does n't go far enough			2
" @entity52 says , ' i knew you before you were even knitted in your mother 's womb			0
' that baby is a baby from the beginning			0
there is no way that you need scientific evidence to know that that baby feels pain , " she said			0
" we have laws on the books now that say if you murder a pregnant woman you are charged with two murders ... so what is the difference here ? " but for @entity72 , the bill is an egregious violation of women 's rights			2
" i am a @entity19 woman , but regardless of what my personal beliefs and experiences are , my personal reproductive choices do not give me the right to restrict other women			0
" in addition to banning abortions after 20 weeks , the bill would require clinics that provide abortions to become ambulatory surgical centers ; would tighten guidelines for administering the drug @entity88 , which can terminate early pregnancies ; and would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they 're providing abortion services			1
critics of the measure said it would shut down most abortion clinics in @entity4 , denying access to many , while proponents say it would raise the standard of care for women			1
the initial bill failed on june 25 after a dramatic day and night in which state sen. @entity109 , a @entity110 , talked for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on the legislative session			1
but gov. @entity115 called a special session so the legislature could take up the measure again			1
@entity115 's announcement that he would not be running for re-election fueled speculation about whether @entity122 can help rejuvenate the @entity123 , which has n't won a statewide election since 1994			0
@entity122 has not yet announced any plans and released a statement congratulating @entity115 on his lifetime of public service adding , " i feel confident the next campaign will sort itself out in due time			0
" @entity131 was quick to condemn the governor in a statement : " @entity115 has done more to hurt women than any governor in history			0
@entity115 's legacy is endangering women 's health in order to score political points with the far - right tea party fringe			0
" the @entity8 committee is expected to vote on the bill after the @entity146 version of the bill is brought to the floor			2
that is expected to happen tuesday , when the legislature reconvenes .			0
