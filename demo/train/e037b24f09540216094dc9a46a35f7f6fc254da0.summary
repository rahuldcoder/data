-- a far - right party recorded the biggest ever share of the vote for a political party in @entity6 's history on monday , after a controversial campaign that blamed foreigners for much of the country 's crime			1
a @entity12 supporter waves a sticker featuring the @entity6 flag during sunday 's elections			1
the nationalist @entity12 headed by @entity16 rode a wave of anti-immigration sentiment to gain 29 percent of the vote			1
the @entity20 also scored well in sunday 's vote winning 20 seats in the 200 - seat @entity23 , @entity6 's lower house of parliament			1
it previously held six seats , making this the @entity20 's best ever showing			0
the @entity27 remain the second - largest party , despite dropping to 43 seats after gaining 19.5 percent of the vote , while the @entity12 added seven extra seats , taking its total to 62			2
the nationalists dismissed criticism of their campaign -- derided as racist by leftist groups -- and insisted that they were only trying to address legitimate public concerns			2
" public security in @entity6 is in danger			2
we have a lot of foreigners committing crimes			0
and the @entity6 people are very sensitive to that , " @entity47 , the party 's secretary general told @entity0			2
the gains made by the nationalists will not result in radical changes to the make - up of the government , however , since @entity6 is run by a form of consensus politics			1
under the @entity6 system , a multi-party coalition runs the country by convention with ministers appointed from the main parties			1
although the make - up of the government will stay almost unchanged , political analysts said the success of the @entity12 and its hostile rhetoric reflected a growing , but worrying trend in @entity6			1
" this may be a surprise for those outside of @entity6 but not for us , " @entity69 , a political scientist at @entity70 , told @entity0			2
" this type of very negative campaigning has been a feature of previous campaigns by them ( the @entity12 ) and reflects concerns among a wide number of people that immigration levels are too high			1
" foreigners comprise a quarter of the @entity6 workforce and make up around 20 percent of the population of more than 7 million			1
the immigrant community is dominated by @entity88 , @entity89 , and @entity90 , though most were denied a vote in sunday 's election because of the difficulty of gaining @entity6 citizenship			1
on the streets of this @entity98 country , the polarizing campaign provoked accusations of racism against the @entity12 and rioting in the capital @entity102			0
@entity16 's party was widely criticized after an ad campaign featuring a poster of a white sheep kicking a black sheep off the @entity6 flag			0
the party also called for immigrant families to be thrown out of the country if their child committed a crime			1
in this usually tolerant country , the hardline approach proved popular as voters unhappy at rising immigration levels handed the @entity12 the best - ever election result , surpassing the @entity121 @entity27 ' victory of 28 percent of the vote in 1919			0
at the same time as the nationalist gains , the country elected its first black politician to the @entity23 , @entity126 , who accused @entity16 's party of " scapegoating "			0
" they are showing that we foreigners are responsible for everything that is bad and we found that they are just simple arguments			0
we condemn it , " he told @entity0			0
@entity126 , who came to @entity6 as an asylum seeker from @entity136 , added : " it shows that in this country there is no social justice			0
a part of the population , they are living well , they have a good salary			0
but a big quantity of the population , they are living in the phenomenon of the working poor			0
" e-mail to a friend @entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
