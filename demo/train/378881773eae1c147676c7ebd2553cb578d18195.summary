-- in these difficult economic times , it seems almost obscene that 60 men will be battling for a share of $ 15 million this weekend			0
but the fact that they can , especially somewhere as hard - hit by the financial downturn as @entity8 , is testament to the glowing health of golf 's @entity10			1
the @entity12 , the climax to the money - spinning race to @entity8 , is the last tournament before the tour begins its 40th year of existence			1
it has grown from an entirely @entity18 - based circuit of 20 events to an almost worldwide phenomenon which also takes many of the sport 's top players to @entity23 , the @entity24 and @entity25			1
in 1972 the total prize pool was the equivalent of € 350,000 ( $ 470,000 ) but it has mushroomed to more than € 132 million ( $ 178 million ) spread across 52 tournaments and 29 destinations -- driving exposure levels with its ever - growing television unit			2
@entity32 holds no terror for golf 's new stars " i think the whole principle of having your own players playing on your own golf courses televised by your own television companies has remained the coherent goal , " chief executive @entity36 told @entity0 from the emirate			1
" we 've moved the tour from a good promotional outfit into a solid operating business , and we can dictate or lead the way the game should be rather than always responding to the wishes of our sponsors			0
" we listen to our commercial sponsors , obviously , and the tv companies , but we decide the direction we want the sport to go in			0
" a new world order when the @entity8 event and rebranding for the tour 's traditional order of merit money list was announced in late 2007 , it was trumpeted as the biggest prize in golf -- worth $ 10 million plus the same in bonuses			1
it was soon downsized to a $ 7.5 million tournament and that amount again in extras due to @entity8 's well - documented debt problems , and the initial five - year agreement -- which was reduced to three -- is about to end			1
@entity36 told @entity0 he was confident a new deal to keep the event in the emirate will be announced before sunday 's winner is crowned			1
" we 're looking at a way to keep it in @entity8 if we possibly can , " the 62 - year - old said			1
" it 's a perfect geographical location to finish our calendar year			0
" the race to @entity8 rebranding has helped the @entity10 become a bona fide rival to its @entity84 @entity83 counterpart , which has a $ 10 million jackpot of its own in the @entity88 series and still pulls in the most sponsorship			1
" when we were the @entity90 with the @entity91 , we united @entity18 on the @entity93 stage			0
this unites the @entity10 on the global stage , and we finish in a place that is readily accessible from most of the countries we visit , " @entity36 said			1
@entity93 success story whether world no. 1 @entity99 makes history by becoming the first player to win the @entity93 and @entity84 money lists in one season , or @entity104 overhauls his fellow @entity106 star , 2011 has been another bumper year for @entity93 golf			1
three of the season 's four major titles were won by tour members , while @entity99 won one of the four @entity114 events and also tied for second , and @entity117 's @entity116 triumphed at another			0
@entity36 is happy with the progress made since he took over in 2005 , having helped launch the tour 's commercial arm in 1984 and developed the television broadcasting side			2
rights for the @entity124 are fought over by three @entity84 tv stations , but the @entity10 's market is a lot more widespread			2
top tips from one of golf 's best coaches " we really grew it enormously when satellite channels began concentrating on sports , @entity132 specifically in the @entity106			1
before that we had to own production ourselves otherwise we were always at the mercy of the @entity141 or tv in @entity143 , and it 's a very difficult sport to televise , " he said			0
" now our company televises more hours of tournament golf than anybody else in the world , and also at a lot of different times -- you 've got to provide a service for 24 - hour golf channels in @entity143 and @entity156 , then @entity146 television is very demanding and you 've got @entity157			0
it 's an absolutely key part of our operation			0
" alongside the main circuit , the second - tier @entity160 has almost € 5 million in prize money while the @entity163 offers more than € 9 million			2
@entity36 said what was once considered the main challenge -- of producing future stars to maintain the sport 's profile -- has already been addressed			2
" the current success of the @entity10 is really a pat on the back for everyone involved in golf in @entity18 , from the amateur clubs to the coaches to people who devote their time to bringing new people into the game			2
there 's no shortage of people wanting to become professionals , " he said			0
@entity184 ambitions and while growth has come from spreading to all corners of the globe , there is still a big focus on concentrating on the traditional heartlands of @entity106 , @entity143 and @entity156 -- which will host the prestigious @entity192 teams event in 2018			2
@entity18 is still a largely untapped market , and the return of golf to the list of @entity184 sports from 2016 could spark further expansion			1
" it has given it a higher profile in developing markets where the @entity184 ideal remains so strong , " @entity36 said			1
" there 's a huge number of new golf courses now in @entity207 since it became an @entity184 sport , and the same with @entity209			1
" unrest in the @entity24 did lead to @entity211 losing the @entity213 event , which will be held in @entity23 next year , but @entity36 believes that golf has a big role to play in such countries			1
" @entity217 is such a force for good and opens the doors in countries you go to , where it becomes more accessible to the local population			0
it ca n't all be done overnight , so you 've got to make inroads			0
" @entity36 's goals players past and present serve on the tour 's board and tournament committee , and @entity36 believes he has the support to continue in his role for the next few years at least			2
his wife suffers from multiple sclerosis and needs 24 - hour care after suffering a brain haemorrhage two years ago , so the father of two has to balance his time spent away on golf business			0
" i 've had a lot to do with golf going to the @entity184 , and i 'd quite like to be around when it first happens			2
and i 'd quite like to see the next @entity192 on @entity246 soil , " he said			0
" that will probably see me through			0
if you 're doing what you enjoy and you 're making a difference and the players are very happy with me ... if the players have had enough then i 'd be off tomorrow			0
" talking to them here , to a man they all seemed remarkably positive and onside -- and you 'd think they would be for the kind of money they 're playing for ! "			0

@entity10 season ends this weekend with the big - money race to @entity8 finale
chief executive @entity36 *hopeful* a new deal will extend @entity8 's involvement
the @entity10 has grown into a worldwide circuit since its birth in 1972
@entity36 is looking forward to golf 's long - awaited return to the @entity184 in 2016
