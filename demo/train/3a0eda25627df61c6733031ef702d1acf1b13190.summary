@entity0 -- former linebacker @entity4 's family sued the @entity5 on wednesday , claiming his suicide last may was the result of a brain disease caused by violent hits he endured playing the game , the lawsuit said			1
last year , @entity4 , 43 , committed suicide in his bedroom in @entity14 , @entity15 , with a gunshot wound to the chest , prompting speculation about whether repeated hits to his helmet over his 20 - year pro career could have been a contributing factor			1
earlier this month , @entity4 was determined to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a neurodegenerative brain disease that can follow multiple hits to the head , the @entity23 said			1
the lawsuit , filed in @entity28 , accuses the @entity5 and helmet manufacturer @entity29 of wrongful death , but does n't specify a figure for compensatory and punitive damages			1

@entity4 's estate also is a plaintiff			1
" we were saddened to learn that @entity4 , a loving father and teammate , suffered from @entity67 , " the family said in a statement			1
" we know this lawsuit will not bring back @entity4			0
but it will send a message that the @entity5 needs to care for its former players , acknowledge its decades of deception on the issue of head injuries and player safety , and make the game safer for future generations , " the family said			1
more than 1,500 former @entity5 players are suing the @entity5 , alleging the league hid the dangers of concussions from them			0
seau was one of a string of @entity5 players -- along with @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 -- who took their own lives and were later diagnosed with @entity67			2
not everyone who is exposed to repeated head trauma would develop the disease , experts say			0
@entity67 can result in @entity96 's - like symptoms such as dementia , memory loss , aggression and depression , but it can be diagnosed only after death			2
the suit alleges a long history of coverup by the @entity5 about the effects of the game 's head trauma			1
" the @entity5 was aware of the evidence and the risks associated with repetitive traumatic brain injuries for many decades , but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from the players , including the @entity84 , " the lawsuit said			2
" today , the @entity5 and its agents continue to market the ferocity and brutality of the sport , " the suit said			2
@entity4 played for the @entity121 from 1990 to 2002 , the @entity122 from 2003 to 2005 and the @entity123 from 2006 to 2009 , the suit said			2
@entity4 was nicknamed the " @entity125 " for his on - field prowess			2
" he was known as a warrior , the invincible patriarch who could be depended on to play through his injuries , " the suit said			0
@entity4 suffered sub-concussive and concussive blows to the head in the @entity5 , sometimes lacerating his face , court papers said			1
during the mid- 1990s , he began to show emotional instability and developed insomnia that afflicted him until his death , the suit said			0
he awoke at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. and could n't fall back asleep			0
he became forgetful about discussions and appointments , and he was unable to concentrate or focus , the suit said			0
he exhibited " self - destructive , aggressive and violent behavior " and suffered extreme depression , withdrawing from his family and children , court documents said			1
his children " would look into his eyes and not recognize the person with whom they were now dealing , " the suit said			0
off the field , his one - time ability to show good business sense dissipated , and he made " impulsive , ill - advised decisions , " the documents said			0
he drank to cope , " entered a devastating cycle of depression and alcohol abuse , " and became a manic , compulsive gambler in which he lost a " significant amount of money in an attempt to make back business losses , " the lawsuit said			0
@entity4 's family donated his brain to the @entity23 for research , and this month it released a statement saying " abnormalities were found that are consistent with a form of ( @entity67 )			1
" according to the @entity23 's pathology report , five researchers -- two @entity23 neuropathologists and three independent experts -- examined slides of @entity4 's brain , and all confirmed that there were signs consistent with @entity67			1
none of the researchers was aware that the brain they were examining was @entity4 's			1
in a recent study , researchers found @entity67 in 34 of 35 deceased @entity5 players whose brains were donated by family members			2
a brain with @entity67 is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau			0
under a microscope , tau appears as brown tangles similar to dementia			0
however , the @entity198 study showed this progressive , tau protein array in football players much too young for a dementia diagnosis , which typically occurs in people in their 70s or 80s .			0
