@entity0 -- a controversial assertion by convicted @entity4 assassin @entity3 to win his freedom was challenged this week by the @entity7 attorney general who said " overwhelming evidence " exists against @entity3 's claims			1
@entity3 's attorneys have said that a second gunman actually assassinated @entity4 in 1968 and that @entity3 was hypno - programmed to fire a gun as a diversion			1
" in sum , ( @entity3 ) can not possibly show that no reasonable juror would have convicted him if a jury had considered his ' new ' evidence and allegations , in light of the overwhelming evidence supporting the convictions and the available evidence thoroughly debunking ( @entity3 's ) second - shooter and automaton theories , " attorney general @entity14 said in federal court papers filed this week			1
@entity3 , the sole person convicted of killing @entity4 , is seeking a new trial or freedom from his life sentence based on " formidable evidence " asserting his innocence and " horrendous violations " of his rights , defense attorneys said in federal court papers filed last year			1
@entity36 , who is asking a federal court in @entity0 to dismiss @entity3 's request , conceded in court papers filed wednesday that his lawyers may be able to show two guns were involved in @entity4 's assassination			1
@entity4 was seeking the @entity44 presidential nomination when he was killed			0
but even if @entity3 's lawyers can show 13 shots were fired in the @entity4 shooting , @entity3 should n't be released from prison , @entity36 said			2
" the mere possibility that more than one firearm was discharged during the assassination does not dismantle the prosecution 's case " against @entity3 , the attorney general said in the latest court documents			1
@entity36 said @entity3 is relying on acoustic expert @entity57 's analysis of a tape recording of the @entity4 shooting that concludes 13 shots were fired during the murder and " demonstrates the existence of a second shooter because ( @entity3 ) only fired eight shots			2
" the attorney general argues that even if there were a second gunman involved in the @entity4 shooting , @entity3 has n't proven his innocence			1
@entity3 " at most has shown that , according to @entity57 , two guns could be heard firing 13 shots in an audiotape of the shooting , " @entity36 said			0
authorities have said eight bullets were fired in the kitchen pantry of the former @entity73 in @entity0 , with three bullets hitting @entity4 's body , a fourth passing harmlessly through his suit coat and the rest striking five other victims , who survived			0
@entity4 , younger brother of the assassinated @entity80 president @entity79 , was shot shortly after midnight on june 5 , 1968 , only moments after the presidential candidate had claimed victory in @entity7 's @entity44 primary election			1
he died the next day			0
defense lawyers @entity86 and @entity87 say @entity57 's analysis of the tape recording shows two guns fired 13 shots -- five more gunshots than @entity3 could have fired from his eight - shot revolver			0
@entity3 had no opportunity to reload his gun in the pantry			0
@entity36 calls @entity57 's analysis " pure speculation			0
" the recording of the @entity4 shooting was made by freelance reporter @entity100			0
@entity101 television videotape of the hotel ballroom , where the senator had just claimed victory in the @entity7 primary , shows @entity100 holding his recording equipment in his left hand while descending a small set of ballroom steps , approximately 40 feet away from the kitchen pantry shooting , and moving towards the pantry during the period when the shots were being fired there , off - camera			0
@entity36 said that even if it could be proven " that a second gunman successfully shot senator @entity4 , ( @entity3 ) would still be guilty of the charged crimes			2
" she said that under @entity7 's vicarious liability law , " an aider and abettor ' is guilty not only of the offense he intended to facilitate or encourage , but also of any reasonably foreseeable offense committed by the person he aids and abets '			2
" the defense argues @entity3 did not knowingly fire at @entity4 but thought he was shooting at circular targets on a firing range			2
they contend @entity3 was a victim of hypno - programming by conspirators who programmed him to fire shots as a diversion for the senator 's real killer			1
for his hypo - programming defense , @entity3 is relying on @entity139 , an associate clinical professor in psychology at @entity141 who has interviewed @entity3 for 60 hours over a three - year period , according to defense attorneys			0
but the attorney general rejected the hypno - programming claim			1
" the theory that a person could be hypnotized into planning and committing a murder against his will is a controversial ( if not fantastic ) one and has not been adopted by most of @entity139 's peers , including the @entity152 , " @entity36 wrote			0
" thus , even if ( @entity3 ) could show that some psychologists believe in mind control or hypno - programming , his showing of actual innocence is nevertheless based on a debatable theory that is not universally accepted in the psychology community , " @entity36 said			1
@entity3 , who turns 68 next month , was denied parole at a hearing last year where he once again claimed to have no memory of the @entity4 shooting , an assertion @entity3 has maintained since 1968 .			0

convicted assassin @entity3 asserts a second gunman killed @entity4
@entity3 was hypno - programmed to fire a gun as a diversion , his attorney says
@entity7 's attorney general says a jury would have convicted him anyway
the evidence against @entity3 is " overwhelming , " prosecutor says
