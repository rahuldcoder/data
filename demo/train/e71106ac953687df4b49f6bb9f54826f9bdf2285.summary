-- @entity2 's original punishment for knocking out his then - fiancee inside the elevator of an @entity6 casino was controversial , but appeared a done deal : a two - game suspension			1
then , this week , @entity9 released footage of surveillance video from inside the elevator that shows the altercation and the knock - out punch			1
the @entity17 suspended him indefinitely			2
the facts never changed -- @entity2 knocked @entity19 ( now @entity20 ) unconscious			1
but the latest video moved the needle in a way that previous coverage had n't			2
it has brought back to the forefront some key questions about the incident : what did the @entity17 know , and when ? the video is shocking and damning			1
it shows @entity2 and @entity19 inside the elevator , where he punches her , and she lunges at the football player			1
@entity2 hits his fiancee again , and she falls to the floor			2
the @entity16 had stood by @entity2 throughout the fallout , and @entity17 commissioner @entity38 did not alter the two - game suspension , even after admitting he made a mistake			1
both the league and the team changed their tune swiftly after this video was released			1
to the disbelief of many , the @entity17 said it had not seen the surveillance footage of inside the elevator until @entity9 posted it on the internet			1
" we requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident , including any video that may exist , " @entity17 vice president of @entity52 , said , specifically citing @entity53 , @entity6 police and @entity56 prosecutor 's office as places where the @entity17 inquired			1
" that video was not made available to us and no one in our office saw it until ( monday ) , " he said in a statement			0
@entity69 , which owns the casino where the incident happened , said it gave copies of the video to @entity6 police , the prosecutor 's office , the @entity67 and @entity2 's attorney			1
the company said it could not confirm if the @entity17 reached out to the casino directly to ask for the surveillance tape			2
the prosecutor 's office and @entity78 did not immediately respond to @entity0 inquiries about the evidence they had , or any requests from the @entity17			2
@entity17 chief @entity38 faces intense criticism after @entity2 video will @entity2 go to jail ? after the incident , both @entity2 and @entity19 were arrested and charged with simple assault			1
in march , a grand jury indicted @entity2 on the more serious charge of aggravated assault , a felony that could bring 3 - 5 years in jail if convicted			2
the next day , he and @entity19 were married			0
while the casino said that prosecutors were given the video of inside the elevator , prosecutors have not confirmed whether it was shown to the grand jury			1
@entity2 pleaded not guilty , and the next step would have been a criminal trial			2
but instead , @entity2 was accepted into a pretrial intervention program for first - time offenders that could clear him of the charges if he successfully completes the requirements			2
" this decision was arrived at after careful consideration of the information contained in mr. @entity2 's application in light of all of the facts gathered during the investigation , " acting @entity56 prosecutor @entity113 told local media at the time			0
" after considering all relevant information in light of applicable law , it was determined that this was the appropriate disposition			0
" the elevator video has renewed outrage , but the court says the prosecutor can not reconsider or ask the judge to revoke the deal with @entity2 unless he commits a new crime or does n't follow along in the program			1
" there 's really no appeal that 's available at this point , " @entity0 legal analyst @entity128 said			0
" the prosecutor accepted and the judge accepted pretrial intervention			0
" it is rare to offer pretrial intervention in domestic violence cases , @entity128 said , but in @entity6 -- with an elevated homicide rate -- this incident probably was not as big a priority			0
@entity2 firing not enough , says senator who wants ' special scrutiny ' of @entity17 how has the narrative changed ? the story itself has n't changed			1
the fact that @entity2 struck and knocked out his fiancee was undisputed from the beginning			1
so why all the outrage now ? the bad taste in many people 's mouths comes from the way the incident has been described to the public by the parties involved			0
as more details emerged , culminating with the elevator video , the louder the accusations of an attempted coverup have become			1
immediately after the incident , @entity2 's attorney described the situation at the time as " a very minor physical altercation			0
" after those statements , an initial video was released by @entity9 , which showed the outside of the elevator , and the unconscious body of @entity19			1
when the grand jury decided to indict @entity2 on the more serious felony charge , @entity2 's attorney , @entity168 , had this to say as he entered a not - guilty plea : " i ca n't try the case in the media			1
there 's a significant set of facts that the public does n't know about yet			0
as soon as those facts come to light , we believe the public will have a different opinion			0
" @entity19 's lawyer also downplayed the incident			0
" no party committed any crime , " @entity19 's lawyer , @entity185 , told @entity0 at the time			0
" this is part of the due process for @entity2 , " @entity16 director of media relations @entity188 said thursday of the indictment			0
" we know there is more to @entity2 than this one incident			0
" with the release of the latest video , many in the public certainly expressed a new opinion , but hardly in favor of @entity2			1
@entity2 video prompts stories of # @entity202 , # whyileft what will become of the @entity204 ? the couple is standing by each other			2
@entity20 on tuesday expressed outrage , too			0
not at her husband , but at everyone making a big deal of her ordeal			0
" no one knows the pain that the media & unwanted options from the public has caused my family , " @entity20 wrote in an online post			0
" to make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret every day is a horrible thing			0
" according to @entity20 , waking up after her husband was cut from his team and suspended from the @entity17 was a nightmare			1
" this is our life ! what do n't you all get , " @entity20 wrote			2
" if your intentions were to hurt us , embarrass us , make us feel alone , take all happiness away , you 've succeeded on so many levels			0
just know we will continue to grow & show the world what real love is ! " @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity236 , in a text message , that " i 'm just holding strong for my wife and kid that 's all i can do right now			2
" @entity2 's wife slams his punishment for violence against her @entity0 's @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report .			0
