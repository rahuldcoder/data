-- a very wise district attorney once gave a piece of pragmatic advice to a young assistant prosecutor investigating a prominent political figure			1
the case involved evidence that could possibly support a criminal indictment yet was unlikely to result in a conviction			2
that da 's advice to his young assistant : " if you are going to shoot at the king , you 'd better be able to kill the king			1
" the wisdom of that literary caveat , self - evident to those who pursue the powerful , is particularly relevant to the gov. @entity21 scandal involving traffic delays at the @entity23			1
in the days and weeks to come , prosecutors with potential jurisdiction over a criminal investigation of @entity21 and his political acolytes regarding the agonizing traffic tie - up -- and a possible subsequent cover - up -- will be carefully screening the evidence			1
they would be wise to consider the pragmatic advice about king - slaying , which has been quietly observed by sensible prosecutors for years			2
three prosecutors have potential jurisdiction : manhattan district attorney @entity37 ; @entity38 , @entity39 , prosecutor @entity40 ; and @entity42 attorney @entity41 , the man who replaced @entity21 as @entity39 's federal prosecutor			1
opinion : a lesson for @entity21 from @entity47 @entity37 is a @entity48 , known for nonpartisanship			1
@entity40 was appointed @entity38 prosecutor by @entity21 's predecessor , a @entity48			1
and @entity41 is the appointee of a @entity53 president with the blessing of @entity39 's two @entity42 senators , both @entity53			0
all three prosecutors enjoy reputations for fairness and integrity in the conduct of their offices , but it would be a deft trick for each of the three to reassure residents of @entity66 , @entity39 and the nation that any investigation ( and possible prosecutions ) will be free of political influence			2
though @entity37 may have a shred of a right to prosecute ( because the bridge touches land in @entity76 ) , i suspect he is wise enough to know that his @entity77 has no business interfering in this @entity39 mess			0
@entity40 , though , has more legitimate concerns -- the individuals most affected were those living in the @entity38 towns he serves			0
there is even a @entity39 criminal statute entitled " @entity87 " relating to the abuse of governmental authority by public servants for personal gain that may be relevant to the bridge brouhaha			0
as a lame duck prosecutor appointed by @entity21 's predecessor , democrat @entity94 , @entity40 will face heavy scrutiny if he tries to slay the king -- in this case , the governor			1
@entity99 , the @entity42 attorney and potential white knight			0
though a registered @entity48 appointed by president @entity101 , he was sworn into office by justice @entity103 , a conservative icon			0
opinion : @entity21 's bogus ' stages of grief ' @entity41 has sterling credentials and a reputation for fairness			1
he 's vowed since 2009 to keep politics out of his powerful office and to depoliticize it after many prosecutions by his predecessor were criticized as having been political in nature			1
the legal bloodlines of this case are more mixed than the contents of a @entity122 landfill			0
@entity41 , as the ranking @entity123 , can force local @entity39 prosecutors out of the ring through a variety of tactics , if he chooses to do so			0
@entity38 's @entity40 could insist on proceeding -- but , in the face of a potentially more serious federal intervention , most local prosecutors would back off			2
why would the locals defer to @entity41 ? the answer is entirely pragmatic			0
these prosecutors have to work together on many overlapping cases as they each seek to round up @entity39 's notorious collection of bad guys			2
and a local da generally defers to a federal prosecutor who can supersede him in a variety of ways			0
politics and pragmatism enters every field in our system , even criminal prosecutions			0
given @entity21 's political prominence -- both in @entity39 and nationwide -- you are certain to see , in coming days and weeks , a steady stream of information discreetly leaked to news media regarding ongoing criminal and civil investigations			1
though @entity21 will endure potentially embarrassing legislative hearings , predictable federal subpoenas , and possible damage to his promising presidential candidacy , i think it 's safe to say the governor will not be indicted			1
there is a greater downside to that scenario : voters may be convinced it is indeed a political witch hunt intended to cripple a leading presidential candidate			1
despite some titillating hints from insiders , the bulk of evidence relating to the bridge fiasco probably remains undisclosed			0
@entity21 , as a former prosecutor , is far too smart to have left his fingerprints or interoffice " dna " on any specifics of the bridge fiasco			1
even if a former aide or political pal testifies against the governor as part of a prosecutorial deal , most jurors would want to see corroboration			0
nobody likes a snitch , even a political one			0
the case will look like a political hatchet job and the wounded , angry " king " may strike back with political vengeance			2
the public will doubt the integrity of the prosecutor destroying his reputation			0
opinion : @entity21 's choice -- be seen as a crook or a schnook ? more of his political aides may fall as the search for scapegoats continues , but the governor will not be taken away in handcuffs			1
why ? because as that wise prosecutor once said , " if you are going to shoot at the king , you 'd better be able to kill the king			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215			2

@entity215 : prosecutors are loath to charge a powerful political figure
he says it 's unlikely that @entity21 left his fingerprints on the bridge issue
the rule is that if you charge a powerful figure , you 'd better be able to win the case , he says
@entity215 : prosecutors will be wary of *perception* that they are on a political witch hunt
