while the settlement addresses the transfer and destruction of videos , photographs and other documents , no monetary damages were awarded and the @entity34 admit no liability			1

the former aide and his wife will get back family videos and photos , though they can not use any that include @entity19 or her daughter -- whom @entity2 has admitted he fathered -- for anything besides family purposes			1

she worked as a videographer on the failed 2008 presidential campaign of the former @entity11 senator , who was also the @entity70 ' 2004 vice presidential nominee with running mate @entity71			2
