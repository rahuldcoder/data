-- i appeared on a couple of segments on @entity0 this week where the topic was the @entity6 demonstrations			1
a question raised was whether this was political			2
the @entity10 spokesperson said yes , arguing that labor unions were behind it ( in fact the labor unions did not join until this week )			2
i said it was economic , but political in the sense that you have a political party -- the @entity20 -- entrenched with the wealthy and @entity21 while doing nothing to protect middle - class @entity23			1
and it is not political			2
executive pay is now about five times higher than it was in 1980 , adjusted for inflation			2
the average salary for the rank - and - file @entity23 worker , however , is about the same as it was in 1980			0
really ? does @entity23 exceptionalism exist only at the top 1 % of our workforce ? did our ceos really get 5 times better than they were in 1980 and our workers remain just ho - hum average ? i do n't think so			0
neither does the rest of @entity23			0
when there is this kind of disparity while these same ceos are paying taxes at a rate lower than their secretaries , their receptionists , and the people who clean their offices , it is personal			2
when he was chair of the @entity57 , my former boss , the late commerce secretary @entity59 , used to say in his stump speech that we live in an era where " the rich got richer , the poor got poorer , and the middle - class got squeezed			1
" this was back in 1992			0
it could not be truer today			0
while president @entity67 has not done things perfectly , he has injected some fairness and balance into the economy to spur growth and job creation			1
more needs to be done , but his attempts have been met mostly by gridlock and a @entity20 that only wants to see him fail			1
in the meantime , corporate profits are at an all - time high , but corporations are paying lower taxes than ever before			1
some are n't paying any at all			0
this week , we see banks tacking on extra fees -- which , contrary to what they argue , would lead them to 13 % more in profits than they were making before the @entity89 - @entity88 went into effect			0
at the same time , @entity47 , while also making record amounts of money ( the average ceo makes $ 11 million a year while the average person makes $ 40,000 ) , have laid off millions of @entity23 while sending our jobs overseas			2
these are not nameless , faceless @entity23			0
they are our neighbors , our friends and even our families			0
@entity20 continue to protect this twisted system			1
and to add insult to injury , @entity10 legislators and the @entity20 presidential candidates want to eliminate the protections the middle class gained from the @entity88 passed by @entity106 and signed by @entity67			1
does the crash of 2008 ring a bell ? are republicans really advocating that the greed of @entity21 be put before the needs of the @entity23 people ? yes , and here 's why : in the 2010 election cycle , corporations spent over $ 275 million getting politicians elected and spent almost $ 3 billion lobbying them			1
while some of those donations went to @entity106 , the vast majority went to @entity20			1
it 's no wonder republicans want less government accountability and more tax giveaways for billionaires and giant companies -- that 's what their corporate donors demand			1
@entity129 , for one , take it personally			0
the second question i was asked this week was whether the demonstrators had a " candidate " in the race			0
he acknowledges @entity23 are angry			0
he knows times are tough and he continues to fight to restore some much - needed protections for exactly the people in that crowd at @entity21			0
he and @entity106 want more balance in the system			2
one way of getting there is the @entity144 -- @entity67 's proposal , named after billionaire @entity146 , that those making more than $ 1 million pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than the rest of us			1
critics scream " class warfare , " and decry the attacks on the " job creators , " and cry " socialism " as they continue to preserve this unjust system that is giving rise to what could be a powerful and sustained movement			1
here are my answers : class warfare ? you bet			1
as @entity146 has said so eloquently , this country has been engaged in class warfare for decades , and guess what ? his class won			1
it is now time to stand up and fight for fairness for the middle class and a balanced approach for working - class families , who have labored just as hard as @entity23 's top @entity47 but have not had the same kind of increases in salary			1
on job creators ? who are they ? the majority of job creation comes from our small businesses , none of which are raking in the salaries of the top 1 % of wealthy @entity23			2
so asking the top 1 % of wealthy @entity23 to pay their fair share and pay at least as high a tax rate as their workers is not class warfare or an attack on " job creators " or socialism			1
it is in fact the @entity23 way			0
meanwhile , in the greatest country in the world , @entity198 children now rank highest in child poverty rates			0
latinos and african - americans suffer from much higher unemployment rates than others			0
with all this taken together , is it any wonder that our masses could be giving rise to our own " spring " ? while it is no @entity212 , the movement is spreading			0
not economic , not political , but personal			1
republicans would do well to take it personally too			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			2

@entity217 says @entity6 is not political or economic ; it 's personal
she says protesters *railing* against corporate greed , status *quo* of unfair taxation
she says @entity20 supports system , *thwarts* @entity67 's attempts at protection for middle class
@entity217 : class warfare ? yes , and the wealthy class won . it 's time to stand up for fairness
