-- it 's been a great week for @entity2			1
on monday , the @entity3 announced its intention to hold the 2016 @entity6 convention in @entity2			1
then on friday , @entity7 said he was " coming home " to the @entity9			0
while sports analysts have universally praised the decision by " @entity7 , " political observers have not been as kind to the @entity14			0
the consensus is that the location of political conventions does n't affect elections			2
to a degree , this conclusion is supported by the political science literature , particularly a 2004 study by @entity23 at the @entity24 , which found that parties gained no significant electoral benefits in states where they held conventions			0
one has to be careful , however , about reading too much into these past election results			0
after all , we only have one presidential election every four years			0
that means in the last 50 years , we have only 13 data points			0
since each party holds a convention , perhaps that number can be doubled			0
still , when looking at conventions , there is the additional problem of looking at all states as if they were equal			0
more than half of the 26 conventions held since 1964 , however , occurred in only four states ( @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 )			0
moreover , the convention in @entity2 will be just the start of a major investment of time and money by the @entity6 in the @entity54			1
clearly this was not the case in @entity46 and @entity57 , for example , where the @entity14 and @entity59 held their conventions in 2004			0
while it is true that the outcome of the 2016 race will not be determined solely by where the political conventions are held , this early choice might help republicans at the margins			0
in our 50 - 50 nation , anything that moves the needle , even slightly , in one direction or the other , is important -- especially if that movement is in @entity54			1
it is very difficult to construct a plausible winning 2016 electoral map for @entity14 that does not include @entity54			2
it is difficult to exaggerate just how evenly divided the two major parties are in @entity54			2
for example , if one adds up all the @entity59 votes for president between 2000 and 2012 , and then compares that number to all the corresponding @entity3 votes during that same period , the difference is only about 150,000 votes out of more than 21 million cast			0
this comes out to a difference of less than 1 %			0
there is no reason to think , therefore , that the election wo n't be very close in @entity54 in 2016			2
and this is where the choice of @entity2 becomes very interesting			2
for @entity14 , the path to victory in @entity54 runs directly through what @entity98 call the " three @entity100 " : @entity2 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
more accurately , the election depends on the final tallies in the three counties that contain these cities : @entity107 ( @entity2 ) , @entity108 ( @entity101 ) and @entity109 ( @entity102 )			1
these are by far the three largest counties in the state , which , taken together , account for nearly 30 % of the population of @entity54			1
if , on election night in 2012 , you began tabulating the vote in @entity54 using these counties first , @entity14 would have been seen as starting out behind by 413,590 votes			1
working though the remaining 85 counties , the @entity14 were not able to overcome this deficit , though they narrowed the gap to 166,272 votes			0
in comparison , the last time @entity14 won @entity54 ( 2004 ) , @entity59 came out of these three urban counties ahead by only 252,594 votes			1
it is not that @entity14 have to actually win in any of these counties to win @entity54 ( they lost two out of three in 2004 )			1
they just have to narrow their losses			0
the problem for the @entity6 is that the trend is getting worse			2
even though president @entity134 's margin of victory in @entity54 dropped by almost 100,000 votes between 2008 and 2012 , the @entity3 vote gap in these three countries increased by nearly 10,000 votes			1
republicans simply can not hope to win @entity54 if they continue to do worse and worse in the three largest counties			1
but can the @entity6 use a @entity2 convention to turn this tide ? simply selecting @entity2 over the other finalist , @entity143 -- pierogies over porterhouses -- sends a good message to the thousands of working - class voters who live in these counties			1
the millions of dollars that will flow into the coffers of @entity2 and @entity107 because of the convention will also not hurt			1
finally , there is a wild card that is precisely the kind of nuance that is often passed over by statistical analyses of past election results			0
a convention in @entity2 will allow the @entity6 to remind @entity107 voters , and urban voters throughout @entity54 , that they once supported @entity14			1
without a doubt former @entity54 governor , senator , and perhaps most importantly , @entity2 mayor , @entity14 @entity163 , will be prominently featured in his home city convention			1
it bears noting that @entity163 carried all three counties during both his gubernatorial campaigns			0
in the end , the analysts may be right and , despite holding their convention in @entity54 , @entity14 will still lose both @entity54 and the national election in 2016			2
@entity173 , the likely @entity59 nominee , is very popular in @entity54			2
on the other hand , if @entity14 do manage to capture both the state and the @entity175 , it will be hard to not give some credit to the @entity6 leaders who decided to take their convention to @entity2			1
and although it is too early to speculate , we should not discount the fact that two @entity98 , sen. @entity182 and gov. @entity183 , have at least a shot at standing on the stage in @entity2 accepting their party 's nomination for president			2
join us on @entity190 / @entity189 .			0

@entity192 : the selection of @entity2 to host the @entity6 convention makes a lot of sense
@entity54 has been a *key* state in presidential elections , and every little bit helps , he says
three counties -- @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 -- will likely determine the next president
