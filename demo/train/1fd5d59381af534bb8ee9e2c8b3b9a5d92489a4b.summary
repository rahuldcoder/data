@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 smugglers involved in people trafficking are also believed to be stealing organs from refugees who are unable to pay their demands for large amounts of cash to take them into @entity11			1
the @entity12 and the @entity13 , from @entity14 , have presented evidence that the bodies of @entity18 refugees have been found in the @entity20 desert with organs missing			1
read the first part of our coverage on the plight of refugees in the @entity20 the @entity4 tribe , one of the largest in the @entity20 , was named by one @entity4 source as being involved in organ thefts			1
a @entity32 leader said he was aware that people trafficking was going on in @entity20 and that in some cases refugees were held in bonded labor and tortured			1
but he added only rogue elements of his tribe were involved			2
according to rights groups , refugees -- from places like @entity41 , @entity42 or @entity43 -- are enslaved and tortured and the women raped if they can not come up with the large sums of money the @entity4 try to extort from them and their families to smuggle them into @entity11			1
among @entity4 leaders in the @entity20 , no one was willing to speak openly about the organ theft			1
tribal leaders said they knew nothing about it or had only heard rumors			2
but @entity56 , head of @entity12 , has photos showing corpses with distinctive scars in the abdominal area			2
all the photos were taken in a morgue in the @entity1 port town of @entity0 after the bodies were brought there			2
@entity56 says the organs are taken from refugees while they are still alive			1
" the organs are not useful if they 're dead			1
they drug them first and remove their organs , then leave them to die and dump them in a deep dry well along with hundreds of bodies			1
" he says he was once taken to the area where the bodies are dumped after the organ removal process			2
he says he believes corrupt @entity1 doctors are working with the @entity79 , coming to @entity20 with mobile hospital units to perform the operations to remove especially corneas , livers and kidneys			1
" mobile clinics using advanced technology come from a private hospital in @entity89 to an area in the deserts of @entity92 and conduct physicals on the @entity18 before they choose those suitable , then they conduct the operation , " @entity56 said			1
@entity2 showed some of the photos of the dead to dr. @entity98 , the former head of @entity89 's forensic department and an expert on the illegal organ trade			2
" there are two kinds of scars			0
one is from a postmortem autopsy and one from surgery , " @entity98 said , pointing to a scar that he says came from an operation that must have been performed shortly before the person died			0
according to @entity98 , the operation was conducted no more than 48 hours before death , indicated by the freshness of the scars			0
furthermore , all the scars are in the area of the liver and kidney			0
" they are good stitches in the area of the liver and the kidney , " @entity98 said while examining the photos on a laptop			0
while @entity98 says he has never heard of organ theft involving @entity18 refugees , he says it seems highly probable that the scars on the bodies come from organ removal			1
" they could open you up , take it out and just let you die			0
the mafia does not care whether you live or die			0
when they cut you open , it would be very painful , so they would give you anesthesia , " @entity98 later said			0
@entity98 has done extensive research on the illegal organ business in @entity1 , which preys on poor people			0
the @entity139 in a recent report called @entity1 a regional hub for the trade			0
an investigation headed by @entity98 found illegal organ trafficking to be one of the most profitable criminal activities			0
" organ trade is the second most profitable trade behind only weapons trade , " he said			0
" it brings in more money than drug dealing and prostitution			1
" one @entity4 tribal chief did put @entity2 in touch with a @entity79 who used to be involved in people smuggling and who was close to the organ theft scheme			1
the source spoke on condition of anonymity but offered insights into the scheme			0
" the doctors deal directly with the @entity32 family , and they buy the organs starting from $ 20,000 , " the source said in a phone interview			2
he offered further details of the logistics required to keep the organs fresh for the transplant into their new owners ' bodies : " the doctors come with some sort of mobile fridge where the organs can be stored for six to eight hours and resold in @entity89 or elsewhere			2
" the source claimed doctors from @entity89 are involved in the organ theft , a claim that has proved impossible to verify			0
" it 's like spare parts for cars , " the @entity79 , who later agreed to meet one member of the @entity2 crew in person , said sarcastically toward the end of the interview			0
a second @entity79 , who also refused to be identified , later gave a similar account			0
the police general in charge of security in @entity20 tells @entity2 that his forces are aware that organ trafficking and theft are going on in their area of operations but that the authorities have not identified who is behind the schemes .			1
