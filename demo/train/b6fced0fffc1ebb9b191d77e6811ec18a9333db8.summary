-- last month at @entity2 , the second - largest refugee camp in the world , i met an accountant who carried his 6 - day - old baby across the @entity7 border from @entity8 , and a mother who can not find her 20 - year - old son -- and knows all too well what has likely happened to him			1
i saw parents too frightened to let their children out of their sight , even to go to school			0
and while visiting @entity8 refugees recovering in a hospital in @entity18 , @entity7 from some of the violence that perhaps foreshadowed the august 21 chemical attacks on @entity8 citizens , i spoke with a woman whose daughter died in her arms			1
these refugees ' stories , interspersed with images of white - shrouded children lying dead -- poisoned in the @entity31 suburbs -- have stayed fresh in my mind			0
the debates in the press over the past three weeks imply that whether or not the @entity35 and its allies apply " lethal force " in @entity8 is the defining question of this crisis			2
whether the @entity35 intervenes militarily is a hugely important question -- politically , strategically , legally and morally			0
but it is not the only one			0
for the civilians bearing the staggering weight of this war , it is not even the most pressing one			0
the war has raised a huge range of unanswered questions and challenges for humanitarian actors that will persist long after any " symbolic " or even intensive military operation			0
these are imperative to @entity8 ' survival and the region 's long - term stability and must not be crowded out as politicians and pundits wrangle over the use of force			1
first and foremost is the question of how to keep borders open for refugees			1
more than 2 million @entity8 refugees have now fled their country			1
the hospitality of @entity8 's neighboring states towards these refugees has been breathtaking			1
for example , more than one in four people in @entity72 today are @entity8 , representing a level of generosity toward refugees that has never been matched by any western state			1
yet -- particularly in @entity72 and @entity7 -- the refugee crisis has resulted in higher rents , reduced wages , overstretched social services , and increased pressure on already limited water supplies			1
all this has ratcheted up local tensions , and increased pressure on governments to limit arrivals			0
while the @entity7 border remains officially open , over the summer @entity90 officials reported " artificially low " arrivals , suggesting that would - be refugees may be encountering obstacles to their escape			1
hurdles are also emerging for @entity8 wishing to cross the @entity72 border			2
as the crisis escalates , redoubled international support is needed to ensure @entity8 's neighbors can accept new arrivals			1
this support must benefit not only the refugees but also the communities that are hosting them			0
a second , related question is how to get @entity8 refugee children into school			2
last month -- it really was a hellish month -- marked what the @entity90 high commissioner for refugees called a " shameful milestone " : the number of @entity8 refugee children reached 1 million			2
many of these children are not in school ( by some estimates , 75 % of children in @entity2 are not in school ) and have already missed months if not years of schooling inside @entity8 before fleeing abroad			1
some kids are not attending school because they are working to support their families ; other refugee children living in towns and cities lack the money to get to school , or are afraid of harassment			2
as bombs drop , getting kids in school may not seem that urgent , but the long - term impacts of a " lost generation " of @entity8 children would be disastrous			1
deprived of educational opportunities , these children are at risk of future unemployment , social marginalization and frustration , potentially prompting them to turn to extremist causes			0
more attention and assistance is needed inside and outside the camps to overcome the barriers that are keeping refugee children out of class			0
equally important is the question of how to do more to assist the estimated 5.1 million @entity8 who are displaced within their own country			2
two million of these are minors , and many are at risk of physical violence and forced recruitment			0
the internally displaced are much more difficult for humanitarian groups to reach , and are out of the media spotlight , which is trained on refugee camps and settlements in neighboring states			0
but we need to be asking what new and creative ways can be found to improve protection and support for this population			0
last , but certainly not least , is the question of how to strengthen @entity8 's democratic opposition			1
this is not just a matter of access to weapons and military training , but the development of civil society organizations			0
many @entity8 refugees have already banded together to support others inside and outside @entity8 , including through the provision of medical assistance			1
we need to be asking what more can be done to strengthen and scale up such laudable initiatives			0
despite the devastation they are enduring , the @entity8 refugees i met in @entity7 are proud , industrious people			1
they have the capacity to recover and eventually rebuild their country -- but if @entity186 countries are to effectively support them , we ca n't let the use of force become the only question on the agenda			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

@entity194 met *traumatized* , *fearful* @entity8 refugees at a camp and hospital in @entity7
she says neighbor countries ' hugely generous to shelter them ; global community must help
she says it 's crucial to keep borders open for fleeing @entity8 and to keep kids in school
@entity210 : helping displaced still in @entity8 very hard ; opposition needs help to provide social aid
