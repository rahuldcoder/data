@entity0 , @entity1 -- five @entity4 soldiers have been charged with killing @entity6 civilians for sport and staging the slayings to look like legitimate war casualties			2
the youngest of those five -- a now 20 - year - old private from @entity1 -- came home a changed man , his mother says			1
and , said @entity16 , the @entity17 not only should have known something had gone dreadfully wrong , but commanding officers should be held responsible			1
" the man that came home was not my son , " said @entity16			1
" he was very thin			0
he 'd lost about 50 pounds			0
he said the @entity17 told him he had a parasite			1
i made him his favorite sandwich , and it took him two days to eat the whole sandwich			0
just could n't eat ; he did n't sleep			0
@entity30 was a healthy , 185 - pound 18 - year - old when he joined the @entity17 , his mother said			1
he came home on leave in april -- weeks before the @entity17 launched an investigation into the suspected illegal drug use by his platoon , @entity36 , @entity35 , @entity35 , @entity35			1
@entity16 ' family had him hospitalized in @entity1 to restore his strength			1
he told his mother that he gave himself daily ivs of fluids in @entity6 to keep hydrated , a claim that horrifies his mother , who can not believe the @entity17 would not treat a soldier who was clearly ill. during his time on leave , she said , he was paranoid , always asking the family their whereabouts , concerned that someone was going to harm them			1
shortly afterward , he returned to @entity6 to rejoin his unit			0
" i threatened to break his leg and keep him home , but he just hugged me and said , ' @entity53 , i 've got a job to finish			2
' it was hard to put him on the plane			0
it was the first time i 've seen him fall apart , when we put him on the plane			0
... he was still hyper - vigilant about making sure we were n't alone , " she said			0
and not long after @entity16 returned to action , the @entity17 launched its investigation , which quickly grew in scope -- with a new main focus on the murder of @entity6 civilians			1
now , @entity16 and four others face numerous charges , including drug use , premeditated murder , possessing body parts and possessing photos of corpses			1
seven others in the platoon are charged with various other crimes , from assaulting a fellow soldier who blew the whistle on the group 's hashish smoking to collecting body parts as war trophies and posing them in grisly photos			2
tapes describe killings for sport @entity16 and some of the others are being held at @entity93 in @entity94 , where the platoon was based , to await courts - martial			1
@entity16 thinks the @entity17 should be held accountable for what happened at that forward operating post in @entity6			1
" if they were smoking that much hashish , you can smell it , " she said			0
" where was the command ? did they just dump these boys off and say go forth and conquer ? " " how did they know what was going on ? my son was a healthy 18 - year - old kid when he went over there , and now he is a mess			2
and i do n't understand why the @entity17 is not going after the officers			1
" the highest - ranking soldier accused is a staff sergeant , @entity112			0
his attorney has declined comment on the numerous charges @entity112 faces , including premeditated murder			1
he has not entered a plea			0
reports show @entity17 sgt. tracked kills with tattoos @entity112 has been depicted in documents and discussed in interrogation videos by some soldiers as the ringleader they feared			1
but no one above his rank has been charged with any offenses -- or , according to lawyers , disciplined for allegedly allowing the platoon to make up its own rules of war			2
@entity16 is charged with the first reported civilian killing in january			1
he is accused of conspiring with cpl. @entity134 to shoot at the civilian and then toss a grenade to look like the soldiers were under attack			0
@entity141 's attorney disputes those accusations			2
" as i stated before , my client through that period of time was suffering from brain damage , " said @entity143 , a civilian attorney representing @entity141			2
" he was treated , not properly treated by a cocktail of drugs , given to him by the military			0
" our defense is not that three people were not shot			0
i do n't think that that 's in dispute at this point			0
... there is a question of who shot them , whether or not my client was mentally responsible at the time of the shootings and what role he played in the shootings			0
" @entity16 is also charged with smoking hashish , possessing a dismembered human finger and wrongfully possessing photos of human casualties			1
his civilian lawyer , @entity169 , said his client did not kill any civilian and was ordered by his supervisor , @entity112 , to keep a human finger			0
" all i can speak for is the charge @entity28			0
@entity30 is associated with , and i 'll tell you that there is no proof that ... @entity16 caused or conspired to cause the death of any human being unlawfully , '' @entity169 said			1
the @entity17 refuses to comment on any aspect of any of the cases and has sought to limit circulation of evidence , especially since videotaped interrogations of some of the soldiers and alleged written confessions by some soldiers were obtained and reported by media outlets , including @entity2			1
but it was the @entity17 's own charging documents that portrayed a platoon gone rogue			1
in explicit detail the @entity17 wrote how killings were staged -- how a fellow soldier was beaten and how @entity112 threw human fingers at another soldier believed to have snitched about the group 's hashish smoking			1
it even charged one soldier with possessing a human skull			0
the charges drew media attention from around the world			0
the @entity17 's response : mostly silence			1
the @entity17 moved to restrict attorney access to what has been described to @entity2 by some who have seen them as a series to a series of gruesome photos of dead @entity6 by allowing inspection of the material only at a secure facility in @entity93			1
a number of attorneys have objected , telling @entity2 the @entity17 is limiting their ability to defend their clients because it is more concerned how the charges are being played in the media and perceived in @entity6			1
the @entity17 even ordered military attorneys to return photos and documents that may have " inadvertently " been sent to them			1
those who have seen the photos say they are worse than those depicting @entity232 prisoners in humiliating poses at the infamous @entity235 prison			0
" these remain allegations , " said @entity236 , a spokesman for the @entity237			0
" they are abhorrent , even as allegations			0
but i think they are , they are an aberration in terms of the behavior of our force , thankfully , and so i do n't think they are in any way representative of how , you know , @entity4 military men and women behave in the field			0
" but let 's let this trial take place , and let 's see what judgment is ultimately rendered			0
and talk to the @entity17 about whether there 's a larger effort to try to look into the chain - of - command issues , " @entity236 said			1
@entity2 tried to pose questions about those chain - of - command issues with both army secretary @entity261 and @entity17 chief of staff gen. @entity262 but received only a brief email in response : " the secretary and chief are going to decline the opportunity to do the interview			2
" soldier blew whistle on platoon that does n't surprise @entity16 , who said the @entity17 has ignored the soldiers and their families in this case from the beginning			1
she said her son insisted on having an attorney present for his questioning and was placed under guard for weeks and told he did not need one			2
eventually he agreed to talk , but @entity169 said he was tricked into doing so , believing he was receiving representation when he was not			0
@entity284 , the father of another soldier charged with murder , told @entity2 he tried to report to the @entity17 that his son had told him about the first murder , only to be ignored by the @entity17			1
two more civilians died , according to the timeline provided by the @entity17 in its charging documents			2
@entity284 said that if the @entity17 had heeded his calls for help those civilians might be alive and his son would not be in trouble			1
the @entity17 is now investigating his allegations that he tried to alert the @entity17			2
warning may have been ignored spc. @entity134 is charged with premeditated murder , although he is seen in an interrogation tape saying he fired his rifle but aimed high and missed			2
his lawyer , @entity302 , said his client is not guilty of premeditated murder despite what his client told investigators on the videotaped interrogation			0
@entity16 said she does n't believe anything the @entity17 says			1
" i hold the @entity17 responsible for this whole mess , " she said			2
" especially now that the @entity312 have come forward and said they warned them about all this			0
this was going on and the @entity17 chose to do nothing about it			2
@entity16 ' attorney said he plans to put on a vigorous defense of his client , arguing that he killed no one			1
and he said he plans to ask serious questions about the @entity17 's command of a platoon that everyone agrees went terribly astray			2
" the only way these kind of allegations can occur is the command is completely derelict in supervising , meaning not there , or they 're ignoring that this kind of conduct may be occurring , " @entity169 said			0
" and i do n't know which one it is at this point			0
" @entity2 's @entity333 and @entity334 contributed to this report			0
watch @entity336 with @entity337 weekdays at 5pm to 7pm et and saturdays at 6pm et. for the latest from @entity338 .			0
