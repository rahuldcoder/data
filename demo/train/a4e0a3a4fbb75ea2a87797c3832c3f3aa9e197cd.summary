-- it 's early in the morning of a grand prix weekend , but @entity4 's kitchens are already sizzling with activity			1
inside @entity8 's roof - top kitchen , four chefs are chopping , stirring and flipping spitting pans in perfect unison			2
" i 'm normally at the track between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. on the busiest days of the race weekend , " the team 's executive chef @entity11 tells @entity0 as he peers out from the steam			1
at @entity20 headquarters , the @entity18 team 's chefs are taking a breather after serving up their popular @entity23 breakfast			1
a traditional fry - up of bacon , eggs and all the trimmings is dished out to the ravenous @entity18 media before every friday practice session			1
@entity31 's extensive traveling circus is not likely to go hungry in @entity32 , which hosts round 11 of the championship on sunday			2
" in a race weekend we go through more than 500 eggs , 15 kilos of butter and 10 liters of olive oil , " chef @entity34 tells @entity0 as he does the maths			2
@entity4 races on its stomach but , like most things in the elite division , fueling the sport is complicated			2
the chefs are spinning plates as they cater for three tiers of hungry mouths -- the race drivers , the teams and vip guests			1
" there are different levels of food service : the drivers ; downstairs is the buffet for the team ; and on the first floor it 's like a really high quality , a la carte restaurant			1
" adds @entity11 , who also oversees the menu for @entity8 's sister team @entity64			1
first to be fed are the drivers , who as toned athletes munch on a more carefully controlled menu			1
" like everyone they have a diet of protein , carbohydrate and healthy fats , " @entity67 , the physio for @entity70 reserve @entity68 , tells @entity0			2
" the only difference is the proportion of each they need compared to someone who sits at a desk all day			0
" the races are mentally and physically demanding so they do need more carbohydrates , for example			0
" each driver 's physique , the track and weather all make a difference to the number of calories burned during a race but at the 2013 @entity18 @entity93 , for example , @entity68 burned 1,175 calories			1
" drivers ' dietary needs like so much in @entity4 , timing is everything			1
" the only important thing for the drivers ' food is that it is on time , " says @entity11 , who prepares the food for @entity8 's four - time world champion @entity100 and @entity101			1
" they have a strict plan which we get in the middle of the week			0
normally they eat one and a half hours before they get in the car			2
" they eat the same thing every week -- it 's basically chicken , vegetables and pasta			2
@entity100 and @entity101 might eat red meat on sunday after the race			2
" @entity34 , who cooks up @entity20 driver @entity122 's meals , reveals : " @entity122 is very set			1
on friday he 'll have chicken salad with tomato and maybe a little mozzarella after first practice			0
" maybe he 'll have some pasta with fresh tomato sauce after second practice			0
interactive : take a trip around the @entity132 " he has the same on saturday and then on sunday a little bit of pasta , tomatoes , olive oil and @entity138 before the race			2
he eats very lightly when he 's driving but he eats when he feels it 's right			2
" across the other side of the @entity20 kitchen , chef @entity141 is spicing up the menu for @entity145			1
" he has the same thing every day , which is wild rice with vegetables and tuna -- but he likes it spicy , " @entity141 reveals			0
" he also has a side salad with a chilli vinaigrette			0
" @entity145 has cut down on the flapjack this year -- he 's not eating it now because he 's trying to keep slim			0
" perhaps the @entity154 's chilli diet and decision to cut out cakes has helped him climb onto the podium twice this season for a resurgent @entity20 team -- but not all drivers are so conscientious			1
" i had one whose diet was penne arrabiata and a @entity165 bar every day , " laughs @entity34			0
lean machine it 's not just @entity4 's drivers who are chowing down on healthy food			1
in an intensely competitive sport , each team looks to gain a competitive advantage any way they can , and that means its staff must be leaner			0
pit crews who are now capable of changing tires in under three seconds rely on exercise regimes and carefully managed diets			0
" i 've been doing this for 16 or 17 years and when i first started everyone was out to have a good time , " @entity34 explains			0
" now there 's a real push to be physically fitter and to base food around healthy eating			1
it 's noticeable up and down the paddock			0
" we 're looking at leaner cuts of meat and fish , we 're not serving fried food and the vegetables are steamed			0
" serving up healthy grub is only one prerequisite for @entity4 's chefs -- quantity is just as important as quality			1
" we make 2,000 - 2,500 meals from wednesday to sunday , " @entity11 calculates			1
" the ingredient we use the most ? well , we do eat a lot of pasta			0
" team staff tend to chow down on the ground floor of the motor homes -- or if the car needs an @entity210 , a takeaway sandwich satiates rumbling tummies			0
the top table on the upper tier of the plush motor homes of the @entity8 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity20 teams , @entity4 's top tables are reserved for vip guests , including local dignitaries , celebrities , business partners and sponsors			1
this is a chance for the paddock chefs to demonstrate their culinary prowess			0
the menus tantalize the tastebuds with beef cheeks and shallot and horse radish confit , crab cakes with sauce vierge and frozen coffee parfait			0
" this is my little baby here , " says @entity11 , proudly surveying his bijou @entity8 restaurant at the top of the motor home			0
" to do a little bit of fine dining , i love this , i need this			0
" i love to do variations , to make old things a bit newer , " adds the @entity244 , who has won awards in his homeland for his cooking capabilities			0
the only problem with fine dining across 19 countries is that sometimes it 's hard to find exactly the right ingredients			0
" if you go to @entity32 and try to find micro herbs , it becomes a bit more difficult , " explains @entity34 with a smile			0
@entity11 agrees , citing @entity262 as a hard place to get healthy food			1
" they have different thinking about those things , but all the other countries have very good products , " he says			0
" for the overseas races , i always start two or three months before , and i send them an order list for the main things -- dairy , cheese and things like this -- and then when we arrive i drive around searching for where i can get fresh meat and fish , and i buy them by myself			0
" @entity283 man with such complex catering demands , it 's no wonder that @entity4 's kitchens are filled to the brim with highly - trained chefs -- @entity217 even has a former @entity18 @entity290 contestant among its ranks			1
the chefs insist there is no rivalry bubbling away between them -- though most also say they serve the best food			1
but arguably at the top of the table is a team which boasts a chef with two @entity283 stars			1
perhaps fittingly , the restaurant rating system was created by a company that was one of @entity4 's tire suppliers until the end of 2006			1
@entity306 , who earned his prestigious stars at @entity308 in @entity309 , has been working in partnership with the @entity20 team since 2011			1
but are @entity122 and @entity145 served up @entity312 on the road ? " @entity283 stars credit the quality of the food and the work you do but we ca n't pretend we 're bringing that to a pop - up restaurant -- and ultimately that 's what ( the @entity20 motor home ) is , " @entity306 , a lifelong @entity4 fan , tells @entity0			1
" what we do try to do is to bring inspirational cooking to @entity4 with the quality of flavor , service , the ingredients and presentation			2
" all the chefs agree , however , that the most important ingredient when it comes to fueling @entity4 's global circuit is a taste of home			1
" we try to make everybody feel at home , " says @entity11			0
" when i see the car running and then the team come in and have good food , i think it helps			2
" @entity34 agrees : " when you spend a lot of your time away from home traveling , the team really look to us to provide home - cooked food			2
" there is something special about this job			0
you 're not just a chef			0

@entity4 's hungry mouths are fed by *skilled* chefs who serve up to 2,500 meals per race
chefs must make sure the drivers ' food is ready on time after each track session
there is a push for teams to eat more healthy food while @entity365 guests pick from a la carte menu
