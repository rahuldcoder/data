-- @entity2 president @entity1 has promised that the @entity5 @entity4 team will not make major changes for 2011 despite this year 's title disappointment , and he tipped @entity8 to return to form			1
@entity8 played very much a secondary role on his return to driving following his horror accident in july last year , and had to watch as new teammate @entity12 was denied his third drivers ' crown on the last day of the season			1
@entity2 were criticized for the tactical decision to have @entity12 follow @entity18 's @entity17 into the pits early on in @entity20 , which consequently helped the @entity22 's teammate @entity21 claim the race victory and his first world title			1
however , @entity1 backed @entity2 to bounce back next year with both drivers at the helm			1
" that is the strength of @entity2 , in that we never give up , " he told the @entity2 website			2
" having been in @entity4 for such a long time , this was certainly not the first time i have lost a world championship at the final race			0
@entity2 ' astonished ' by politician 's rant " changes within the team ? that is not our philosophy , because for years now we have adopted a policy based on dynamic stability : a few minor adjustments are possible , but no major upheaval			1
" @entity12 was amazing , both on and off the track : determined and full of self - belief , a real driving force			2
i expect a lot from @entity8 next year : i am sure he will return to being the man we saw in 2008			2
" the @entity53 driver , who was denied the drivers ' title by @entity56 at the final race two years ago , played down suggestions that he was battling for his future at @entity2			1
" i do n't think 2011 signifies a crucial year for me			0
fundamentally , i have been in this situation often , " he told the team 's website			1
@entity8 impressed with new @entity64 tires " i remember that at the start of 2006 , many people said i would only last a year at @entity2 and then i won races that season and went on to stay for a long time more			1
" this year , there were many who said i would have a difficult year after my accident in @entity73 : it turned out that way , but not for that reason			0
over the years , the names of at least 10 drivers have been put forward as replacements for me at @entity2 , but i am still here ! " @entity1 also backed team principal @entity80 as the @entity2 seek to adapt to technical changes in 2011 and add to the marque 's 15 drivers ' titles and 16 constructors ' crowns			1
" i am very happy with the work with which @entity80 is moving us forward , with great ability , spirit and a sense of balance , " the 63 - year - old said			2
" for 2011 there will be various technical changes , from the return of @entity97 to the arrival of @entity64 tires and an adjustable rear wing			2
" we are starting from a solid base			0
i 'm thinking here of the fact that at the end of last year , our energy recovery system was very competitive			0
as for the rear wing , i hope we start the season with total clarity as regards the regulations			0
i am not worried about it , but our experience of 2009 still grates			0
" @entity1 revealed that 2011 will also be a big year for @entity2 both on and off the racetrack			1
" we are finalizing the details for our first showroom in @entity116 , we are strengthening our position in @entity118 and the @entity119			0
in @entity4 terms , we have very clear targets , " he said			0
" there is a great will to fight back and be ready for next season , when our aim is to have a car that , right from the start , is capable of winning so that we do n't have to play catch - up			0
