the internet is a dangerous place for @entity3 right now			0
it 's where death threats lurk and vile messages appear faster than they can be deleted			0
but it 's also a place where support is growing in a @entity12 counter-campaign -- # @entity13 -- to the urgings of a @entity16 - based white supremacist website , the @entity17 , to " be as nasty , hurtful , hateful , offensive , insulting and ' vilifying ' as you possibly can			1
" and they have been			0
" leave now before we behead your mother and bury you all with pigs ... " said one tweet from an account , which has since been suspended			2
many of the messages include extremely offensive hashtags			2
@entity3 , an @entity30 lawyer and founder of the @entity32 , which tracks instances of abuse against @entity35 , knows exactly why she 's being targeted			1
" the reality is people do n't abuse me just because i 'm a woman or because my name is @entity3 or because i 'm @entity39			2
they abuse me because i have a scarf on my head and because i 'm a muslim , " @entity3 told @entity1			2
last october , @entity3 posted an image of a t - shirt for sale in @entity47 , one of @entity30 's biggest retailers , which showed the @entity30 flag with the words " if you do n't love it , leave			1
" she called the shirt " bigoted , " a flood of complaints followed and the shirt was withdrawn from sale			0
@entity47 apologized and blamed an ordering error , saying it " should never have been on our shelves			0
" that could have been the end of it			0
however , three months later , the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) -- a right - wing group that 's calling for @entity67 to be banned in @entity30 -- posted @entity3 's tweet on its @entity70 site , along with another one she posted saying " everyone is entitled to dress as they please , " with the title " @entity73 ? " the post attracted dozens of offensive comments			1
abusive tweets followed but the campaign took a more sinister -- and organized -- twist when the @entity17 implored its " troll army " to attack her			1
the post , in part , justifies the attack as revenge for the prosecution of a 22 - year - old woman from @entity88 , in the @entity30 state of @entity90			1
the woman allegedly sent a stream of invective to @entity3 , calling her a tramp , whore , " rag head " and other offensive names			2
she 's been charged with " using a carriage service to menace , harass or cause offense " and is due to appear on court on march 11			0
on the blog post calling for the tirade of abuse , the @entity17 publisher justifies the attack by saying attempts to ban freedom of speech " should be responded to with the most ridiculous conceivable hateful speech			1
" it recalls a similar " successful " campaign against @entity111 , a @entity112 mp who was targeted with a barrage of abusive messages after a man was jailed for sending her an anti-semitic tweet			1
" the goal of these operations is to purposefully enrage the target , so as to escalate the situation to the level of media attention , and the method for doing that is through the most extreme speech possible , " writes @entity17 publisher @entity117 on one blogpost			1
he said attention would force a discussion about whether people should be jailed for hate speech , concluding that " the vast majority of @entity134 ( sic ) people do not think name - calling should be an imprisonable offense			0
" @entity3 is adamant the campaign of intimidation will not be successful			2
" if their stated objective is to silence me , then my stated objective is to do the exact opposite , " she said			0
earlier this week , @entity30 prime minister @entity143 foreshadowed tougher penalties for hate speech , as part of a move to strengthen the country 's counter-terrorism laws			1
" no one should make excuses for @entity153 fanatics or their imitators here in @entity30 , " @entity143 said			1
@entity30 's race discrimination commissioner @entity155 -- who himself has been the target of a @entity17 hate campaign -- says the country 's current laws under the @entity163 " send an important message to bigots and racists			1
" " those who peddle messages of hatred should be made to answer for their extremism			0
and they should know that the rest of @entity30 society rejects their promotion of fear and division , " he said			1
however , the @entity163 does not cover attacks on a person based on their religious beliefs			0
that 's covered by state laws , which vary from state to state			0
@entity3 said in @entity182 , where most of @entity30 's @entity35 live , there 's no law to cover @entity35 who are abused on the basis of their religion			1
of the @entity90 woman due to face court , @entity3 said , " had this woman not referred to my ethnicity , i would have absolutely no grounds to take action against her			0
" but even a change in @entity30 law would n't solve the issue of attacks emanating from outside the country by trolls who create multiple fake accounts to attack then vanish			2
the @entity17 has issued instructions to its followers on exactly how to do it , reminding them not to threaten violence ( though some have ) , presumably in an attempt to avoid legal action			1
right now , @entity3 is concentrating on naming the trolls and urging her 15,000 followers to block their accounts			0
" i 'm still getting horrifying images and abusive tweets but , as bad as that sounds , i 've become accustomed to it			0
i 've developed a thick skin and for me it 's about exposing bigotry and raising awareness about @entity220			0
