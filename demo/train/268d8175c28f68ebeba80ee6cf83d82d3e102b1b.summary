that was the first drop in civilian casualties since the @entity1 began publishing the figures in 2007			2

civilian deaths increased 14 % from the first six months of 2012 to 1,319 , the report said , while injuries rose 28 % to 2,533			2
" the violent impact of the conflict on @entity3 civilians marked by the return of rising civilian casualties in 2013 demands even greater commitment and further efforts by parties to the conflict to better protect civilians who are increasingly being killed and injured in the cross-fire , " said @entity23 , the @entity1 secretary - general 's special representative for @entity3			0
