-- for those that live and work in the @entity4 , @entity1 is a period of considerable downtime			1
in many countries , special laws require the working day is reduced to accommodate those fasting ( observers are meant to abstain from food , water , cigarettes -- even gossip -- during the daylight hours of the month - long holiday )			1
as a result , tv consumption goes up , and with it , tv advertising budgets			2
" it 's like the @entity25 and @entity26 combined , only instead of one week or ten days , it lasts all month , " explains @entity20 , the managing partner at @entity22 - based advertising firm @entity21			2
while many countries in the region lack metrics to measure the ratings , there are several indicators that viewership spikes dramatically			2
an audience measurement system called @entity35 was introduced in the @entity36 last year prior to @entity1 , and found that @entity36 viewers watched tv for an average of six hours and nine minutes a day during the first ten days , 32 minutes more than during the first six months			1
" average viewership is a couple of hours during normal days			0
on @entity1 , it is double that , because people have more downtime ; more me - and we - time , " says @entity46 , the ceo of @entity48 's @entity4 headquarters ( @entity49 )			1
read more : innovation gets a kick - start as a result , it is not uncommon for companies in the region to spend a third or more of their advertising budget over @entity1 , according to the @entity58 ( @entity59 )			1
if advertisers can hitch themselves to the right program , the benefits can extend well beyond the season			2
" past trends indicate that television media that performs well during @entity1 carry their ratings earned for months to come , " explains @entity64 , @entity59 's marketing director			1
@entity68 and @entity69 are among the biggest spenders in the @entity4 during the month , with telecommunication companies often bringing up the rear			1
in 2012 , @entity69 spent $ 91 million on pan-arabic television spots , @entity68 $ 40 million , and telephone companies like @entity74 and @entity75 spent between $ 40 and $ 50 million each			1
a good portion of @entity1 commercials are rife with @entity79 , says @entity20			1
" you can expect to see a lot of star - studded skies , night time , lanterns , and some sort of @entity87 motif in the background , " he says			1
traditionally , he adds , breaking the mold can prove challenging			0
" what stops a lot of agencies from pushing the envelope is this fear of offending people with a new idea			0
" watch : backstage at @entity98 's hottest tv show in 2006 , @entity20 decided to try something different with @entity100 's , an international fast food chain that wanted to gain more traction with @entity104 youth			2
they decided to take a humorous approach to the ritual of fasting , and depicted a man hovering over a @entity111 's drumstick , waiting anxiously for the sun to set before taking his first bite			0
" the beauty of it was that we showed @entity117 have a good sense of humor and enjoy having a good laugh			0
we did n't rely on a local idea that only people from the region would understand , " he explains			2
though it 's been several years since the @entity111 's ad first launched , it remains the most viewed ad during the @entity1 season , thanks to its internet presence			1
" the @entity111 's gained from the ad was great			0
it was not geographically limited to the @entity4 , but went across the globe			0
" it is not uncommon for an exceptional ad to take on a cult status during this time of year			0
@entity49 accomplished a similar feat last year with a series of commercials for @entity140 featuring the country 's most famous soap actors			0
despite the advert 's kitsch - value , @entity46 notes that the themes , which revolve around values and the spirit of giving , rarely change			0
" the idea is always caring and sharing			0
you can show that in the expected way -- using traditional families , moons and smiles -- or you can do it in the unexpected way , " he adds			0
last year , @entity49 created some community service spots for @entity159 's , a telecommunication company			0
the commercials addressed issues like litter clean - up and respectful line formation			0
far from saccharine , however , they depicted people losing their patience and entertaining @entity168 - like fantasies before reigning in their temper and engaging in the forgiving spirit of @entity1			1
" one of the things that 's so peculiar about @entity1 is that all @entity117 countries live the same routine of life for a month ; they go back to the traditional values of their culture -- i would say that 's what 's at the heart of it , " notes @entity46			1
in spite of the holiday 's unifying properties , @entity20 notes that regional differences shape the types of ads that run			2
" in the @entity189 , you still do n't really have the freedom to explore new ideas when it comes to @entity1 because it 's still a bit more conservative			1
in cultures such as @entity195 , where the season is a lot more festive , you find a lot more engaging content than anywhere else in the world , " he says .			0
