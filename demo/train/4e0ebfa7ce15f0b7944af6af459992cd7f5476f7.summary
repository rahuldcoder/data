-- pick a box - office record and " @entity2 " has probably broken it			2
biggest opening weekend of all time ? check			2
biggest saturday gross of all time ? check			2
most popular movie released this year featuring intense archery scenes ? ( sorry , " @entity9			2
" ) highest - grossing superhero movie ever ? not yet , but consider this a warning : " @entity12 , " your days are numbered			1
but as we all know , the most important thing about " @entity2 " is undoubtedly its role in the brilliant career of one @entity18			1
back in october , the @entity19 named @entity18 the highest - grossing actor in the history of movies -- the result of @entity18 's insane four - films - per - year work ethic , his willingness to take supporting roles in mega-productions , and what we can only assume is a tremendous sense of humor			1
now that " @entity2 " looks set to make a billion dollars before the end of this sentence , the question becomes : can anyone ever outgross @entity18 ? after his cameo in " @entity39 , " the actor signed a nine - film commitment with @entity41 , which means we can expect him to pop up in the next cycle of @entity46 movies			1
( easy money says that he has a brief appearance in " @entity49 " and a bigger role in " @entity51			0
" hard to see how he fits into " @entity53 , " unless it turns out he 's the human incarnation of @entity56 , which would be cool			0
) even if phase 2 of @entity41 's mad - scientist movie plan is n't as successful as phase 1 -- heck , even if " @entity2 2 " makes half of what " @entity2 " has made in two weeks of global release -- @entity18 looks likely to achieve a career global tally of $ 10 billion			1
by comparison , @entity66 has only grossed $ 7 billion			1
and @entity66 does n't get invited to devour the scenery in @entity70 movies			0
in short , that eyepatch might turn out to be the single most lucrative prop in movie history			0
if you could wear that eyepatch and @entity77 's ruby slippers and @entity85 's " breakfast at @entity84 " dress while riding @entity78 the @entity79 and swinging @entity81 's lightsaber ... well , you 'd be a real weirdo , but at least you 'd be wearing a totally sweet eyepatch			0
