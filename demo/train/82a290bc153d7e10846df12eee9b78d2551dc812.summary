@entity0 -- @entity2 suspended food and milk imports from five prefectures in @entity6 on wednesday after radiation was detected in vegetable imports at the city 's international airport			1
the government banned products that include milk , milk powder , vegetables and fruits produced and harvested from @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , according to the @entity23 and @entity22			2
@entity6 meats and seafood imports have also been suspended " unless there is official evidence stating that these products are in compliance with safety rules , " the department said			1
the @entity32 on tuesday issued an import alert preventing milk , milk products , fresh vegetables and fruit from any of four prefectures -- @entity21 , @entity19 , @entity18 and @entity20 -- near the @entity21 nuclear reactors from entering the country			1
but shipments of spinach , milk and a leafy vegetable called kakina could " test out " and enter the @entity48 food supply if shown to be safe , an @entity32 spokeswoman said			1
other foods from those prefectures will be diverted for testing , she added			2
@entity6 food imports make up less than 4 % of food imported into the @entity48 , the @entity32 says			1
" let 's say the contaminated spinach from @entity6 did make its way to the @entity48 , " posed @entity1 's dr. @entity54			1
" a person would have to eat the contaminated spinach from @entity6 every day for one year to get the same amount of radiation you would get from one @entity63 ( @entity63 ) scan			2
" but the import bans are a part of a ripple effect stemming from a march 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that wreaked havoc on the @entity72 nuclear power plant 's six reactors and led to the release of unknown quantities of radioactive vapors			1
the @entity48 @entity76 said three air monitors in @entity78 and one in @entity79 have detected levels of radiation that were " millions of times below levels of concern			0
" in @entity6 , that country 's @entity85 reported tuesday finding radioactive materials at levels " drastically exceeding legal limits " in 11 types of vegetables grown in @entity21 prefecture , including broccoli and cabbage , according to @entity95			2
none of the vegetables have been shipped since monday , it said			0
the news agency , citing the ministry , said , " if a person eats 100 grams ( 3 1/2 ounces ) of the vegetable with the largest detected amount of radioactive materials for about 10 days , it would be equal to ingesting half the amount of radiation a person typically receives from the natural environment in a year			0
prime minister @entity109 asked @entity19 to suspend shipments of raw milk and parsley , and the government of @entity114 told residents not to eat leafy vegetables , @entity95 reported			1
@entity6 's @entity117 listed specific export bans on food items from @entity19 , @entity18 and @entity120 , but did not list similar restrictions on the same food items for domestic consumers in those areas			1
the website of the @entity6 prime minister 's office noted that " temporary consumption will not affect your health			1
" meanwhile , countries across the region implemented safety measures in an effort to restrict potentially tainted imports			0
@entity136 's government is focusing on @entity6 shipments of meat , milk , fish and seaweed			1
a radiation physicist from the @entity143 said the agency will work with the country 's health ministry to do random checks of imported food from @entity6			1
@entity149 has also ordered radiation tests of @entity6 food at its ports and airports			2
only food originating from @entity6 after march 11 will be tested			2
but the impact on @entity6 food production and exports will largely depend on the types of radionuclides and the amount of radioactivity deposited where the food is produced or harvested			2
radioactive iodine is considered an " immediate concern , " but it has a relatively short half - life , according to the @entity165 and @entity166			0
but radioactive caesium has also been detected in @entity6 food , which can linger for years and cause long - term problems for food production and human health , according to the agencies			1
on sunday , @entity6 authorities slapped restrictions on milk and spinach that tested positive for radioactive cesium - 137 and iodine - 131 isotopes			1
it collects in the human thyroid gland , which readily absorbs iodine , and could cause health problems , said dr. @entity184 , an oncology professor at the @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187			0
in addition to the spinach and milk , very small amounts of radioactive iodine have been detected in tap water near the plant			0
@entity184 , an expert on the effects of radiation on the survivors of @entity198 and @entity199 , said he believes the radiation levels measured in these products pose a " nonexistent " immediate risk to humans , and " very low " long - term risk			0
still , he concedes that " radiation doses ingested through food is really very poorly understood			0
" " children , especially very young children , concentrate iodine in the thyroid , and their thyroid is more susceptible to the radiation , " he noted			0
the immediate health risks for adults , by contrast , are minimal			0
" i do n't think you could eat enough spinach and you probably could n't drink enough milk to have health risks , " @entity184 added			2
in the longer term , " there is still a theoretical risk of development of cancer , 10 , 20 , 30 years later , " he said			0
but in the short term , radioactivity levels " would have to be a factor of 10 greater to have any demonstrable health effects			0
" on wednesday , @entity0 government officials advised residents not to give tap water to infants or use it in formula after tests at a purification plant detected higher levels of radioactive iodine			0
the city 's water agency said the spike was likely caused by problems at the @entity72 nuclear plant , located 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) away .			0
