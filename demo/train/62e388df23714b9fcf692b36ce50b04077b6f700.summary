" this is not the end of the fight though			0
i 'm happy to be home and have a normal life again			0
" @entity2 has come under intense media scrutiny since winning the right to stage the @entity25 , particularly over its employment laws -- notably the kafala system , which requires expatriate workers and some visitors to have a residence permit			1
@entity1 was met at the airport by @entity32 , another player who found himself in a dispute with a @entity2 club and who has taken his case to football 's governing body @entity37			1
" i am so happy for @entity1 to come home but the real victory will be when the kafala system ends , " said @entity32 , a @entity39 who played for several @entity6 clubs and @entity43 's @entity42 before moving to the emirate in 2010			1
" if they do n't change kafala then they should change where the @entity25 is , " @entity32 told @entity0			0
the @entity53 case has prompted the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) to demand a change to workers ' rights in @entity2			1
@entity54 general secretary @entity58 said in a statement that @entity1 ' case has " come to illustrate the conditions faced by 1.3 million migrant workers in @entity2			1
" " the torment that @entity1 and his family have been put through because of bad laws which give workers no rights should never be repeated , " she said			1
" sadly , today in @entity2 there remain many workers who have no voice			2
the @entity2 authorities should reform their laws to respect @entity74 conditions			2
" @entity75 , the global players ' union , is set to visit @entity2 this week for talks with the country 's football authorities and organizers of the @entity25			1
neither the @entity2 @entity80 nor the @entity2 @entity81 were available for comment , but in october the @entity83 told @entity0 that " as in any other football association in the world , there will unfortunately always be contractual disputes between clubs and players / coaches			1
" it went on to add : " it is also relevant to emphasize that up to now the player has not taken any action in front of the competent judicial bodies of @entity37			0
" our records show also that @entity1 received salaries from one of our other affiliated clubs , @entity103 , when he played there during the second half of the 2011/12 season			2
" at the end of that season , @entity1 contacted the @entity83 for outstanding salaries from @entity103			2
the @entity83 immediately took action and , after analysis and investigation which gave him right , the player received full compensation			0
" however , in the alleged case of @entity116 , @entity1 did not contact @entity83 , although he had experienced the efficiency of doing so when his request was legitimate			2
" on tuesday , @entity37 president @entity119 condemned @entity121 media for " attacking " and " criticizing " @entity2			2
" it is not fair when the international media and especially @entity121 media are taking up the focus of an @entity131 country here in @entity133 , and attacking , criticizing this country , " @entity119 said to delegates at the @entity124 awards in @entity125 , @entity126			0
" we are defending it			0
we have taken the decision to play a @entity25 in the @entity131 world and we have taken the decision to play in @entity2 and we will go and play this ... in 2022 in @entity2 , " @entity119 added			0
earlier this month , he condemned working conditions in @entity2 as " unacceptable " following an @entity143 report which claimed migrant worker abuse was rife			0
but for now , at least , the @entity53 family can celebrate being home and together again			0
