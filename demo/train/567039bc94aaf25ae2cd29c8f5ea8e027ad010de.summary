-- soccer stars have plenty of spare time , and plenty of money , so this week 's revelations of players gambling on events during @entity10 matches should come as no surprise			1
@entity13 's claims that " spot - fix " betting was rife when he was a player have attracted the attention of world governing body @entity16 , which is also battling against the widespread problem of match - fixing			1
the @entity10 has a well - documented gambling culture , with big names such as @entity21 and @entity22 owning race horses and featuring in big - stake " card schools " on international and club duty			1
before them , @entity28 internationals @entity27 and @entity29 had highly - publicized problems with gambling and alcohol			1
former @entity34 player @entity13 is the latest to talk candidly about footballers ' vices , revealing that he and other top - flight stars made money out of betting on minor events in games such as the first throw - in or corner kick			1
@entity44 court : former @entity16 president took $ 1.5m in bribes " for a while we did this almost every week , " @entity13 told a @entity48 television channel			2
" we made a fair bit of money			2
we could make deals with the opposing captain			2
" for example , betting on the first throw , the first corner , who started with the ball , a yellow card or a penalty			1
those were the sorts of thing we had influence over			2
" the results were never on the agenda			2
that is something i would never have done			2
even though what we did , of course , was illegal , it was just a fun thing			2
" strict regulations and laws govern what professional footballers are able to gamble on , but are football 's lawmakers taking the problem seriously enough ? world governing body @entity16 released a statement on wednesday outlining its intention to look into @entity13 's claims			1
" @entity16 is monitoring this issue and involved its chief investigator in @entity28 , " @entity16 told @entity0			2
" once all information is known it will be decided who is leading the investigations			0
" the @entity10 , which recently raised $ 4.5 billion selling broadcasting rights in @entity91 , declined to comment on the matter , while the @entity93 gave no indication it would be investigating @entity13 's claims			1
" the @entity93 has strict policies on this and our sanctions are wide - ranging			0
all participants also have a duty to report any such activity , " it told @entity0			0
" football works closely with the gambling industry to monitor all markets and activity and we have a unit focused on maintaining the integrity of the sport			1
" while the allegation of illegal activities within " the beautiful game " is worrying , it also shines a light on another possible parasite eating away at soccer 's top players			1
@entity118 was an international teammate of @entity13 's and enjoyed an eight - year @entity10 career with @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			1
the former midfielder said he was not aware of any spot - fixing when he played , but he does recall jokes being made about the subject during his time in @entity28			0
" one of the examples @entity130 put forward was that you could bet on the first throw - in , " said @entity118 , who retired in 2005			1
" i remember we joked about that sometimes , but it was never seriously discussed			0
it was a rumor which went around at the time			0
" i suppose having learned about what 's happened it would be naive to think it was n't there , but i ca n't say to what extent it was there			0
" @entity118 did acknowledge that players would bet thousands of pounds on the way to matches			1
" it 's not well known , but there have been cases , " he said			0
" people could lose Â £ 3,000 or Â £ 4,000 on a bus trip to @entity153			0
obviously that 's not the best way to prepare for a game			0
" at one of my clubs they put an end to gambling on the bus on the way to away games			1
i think there are a lot more problems going on than people get to hear about			0
" the @entity10 's highly - paid players have become celebrities , which can make it even harder to admit to a gambling problem when your fans see you as a sporting hero			1
" gambling addiction is not something players talk about ... they would never come out and say that , but you could sense it from the way they gambled on cards , horses and football , " @entity118 said			1
many sportsmen suffering from addiction problems have turned to the @entity189 , a charity set up by former @entity28 captain @entity27			0
" the issue may be getting to admit there is a problem in the first place , " said a @entity191 spokesperson			1
" if you 're talking about footballers , there is a very clear , defined process in place			0
" the @entity201 ( @entity201 ) -- the union which represents the concerns of players in @entity28 and @entity204 -- refers cases of addiction to @entity191 , which offers residential care			1
" if you are a professional player at any level , if you are a member of the @entity201 , there is a huge support network in place which we are part of , " said the @entity191 spokesperson			2
" there is a clear , full process in place which we are almost the culmination of			0
we get to see what you would almost consider the worst cases			0
" however , @entity201 management committee chairman @entity218 suggested greater regulatory scrutiny raised privacy issues and also threatened to make the problem worse			2
" we 've not had a survey or a general questionnaire about the gambling habits of the players , " said @entity218 , who was part of the @entity225 team which played in the @entity10 in the 2009 - 10 season			1
" the problem is that gambling calls into question the integrity of a match and of the sport			1
" as a union , we 're never going to stop players gambling			1
if you were to put a blanket ban on it you would just drive it underground			2
that would only serve to put people in a far more precarious position			2
" @entity245 , who went to @entity191 when he battled alcoholism , would like to see the clinic given greater resources			0
" i think it 's an excellent facility and one which needs to expand			0
it 's a perfect setting to get away from the outside influences of what is going on in your life and really focus on addressing your issues , " the 32 - year - old said			0
" in that perfect setting there are people who have an empathy with what is going on in your life , which is the greatest thing anyone can show you			0
" @entity218 refused to blame the @entity10 or the @entity93 for their response to gambling and spot - fixing , saying it is the role of the @entity201 to understand the needs of footballers			1
" you 're caught between a rock and a hard place , " he said			0
" i do n't think anyone has hit on the solution yet			0
" is it the @entity93 's remit to cure the ills of the individuals within the game ? probably not			0
it is the @entity201 's remit to make sure we 're aware of the what the lads are going through and the problems they are facing			0
