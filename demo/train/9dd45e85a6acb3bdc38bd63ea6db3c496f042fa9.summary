-- april 26 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : a color change , an egg roll , and an extraordinary talk show host			1
@entity0 is back -- and so am i -- to bring you 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines from around the world			2
first up : @entity22 @entity23 : first up , police in @entity25 , @entity4 are going door to door , telling people to get out			2
that 's because of concerns about a levee on the @entity31			1
levees are barriers that are designed to prevent flooding			2
but according to an alert that went out yesterday from the @entity36 , this levee " is weakening by the minute and may fail at any time			1
" it 's another way that the state is suffering from the effects of severe weather			1
@entity25 is about 130 miles south of @entity42 , and that 's where this damage happened			1
parts of @entity42 hammered by a tornado over the weekend			1
if you 're in the path of a tornado , you 've probably heard the big safety tips , which might include get in the basement if you 're in a building that has one			1
@entity54 is about to show you why			2
( begin video ) @entity56 , @entity57 national correspondent : this was the most destructive tornado of the season			1
this is what an f - 4 twister looks like			2
that assessment was made , in part , by the damage you see here at this house and what you 're seeing throughout the @entity72 subdivision , where we are in @entity4			1
i believe we 're in the kitchen area , and the reason why i 'm saying that is because we see that the refrigerator is right here			2
in any event , the guy who lives here has had a really rough time			2
he actually works at the airport			2
he was there when the tornado struck			1
he and his colleagues hunkered down there			2
then he got a phone call saying that maybe his home was destroyed			1
he drove here and this is what he saw			2
and there 's something i want to point out here , because this is worth showing here on camera			1
you know how they always say that you should go to the basement			1
this is exactly why you should go downstairs to the basement during a tornado , because while the upstairs is gone , the house is destroyed , the basement is basically intact			1
you have a little bit of the roof coming down here from the rain , but for the most part , this basement is intact			1
the guy who lives here has a couple of dogs			2
the dogs actually took refuge in the basement and are ok			1
but here 's why you should go to the basement during a tornado			1
( @entity125 ) new alert system @entity23 : the @entity128 government 's updating its terrorism alert system to let @entity128 know about possible threats , and the new version goes into effect today			1
and you might be familiar with the old , color - coded system			1
it was put in place after the september 11th , 2001 terrorist attacks			2
there were five colors , from green through red , that indicated risks from low to severe			2
under this new system , announced by @entity146 secretary @entity145 last week , there will be two kinds of alerts : an elevated threat and an imminent threat			1
@entity151 said the goal of this change is to help people understand the threat better			1
that way they can know how to react			2
when she announced the new system last week , @entity151 said there is currently no threat that would qualify for either of the two new alert levels			1
this day in history @entity23 : on this day in history , april 26th : in 1865 , @entity164 was tracked down and killed 12 days after he assassinated president @entity165			2
in 1986 , unexpected problems during a mechanical test at the @entity169 plant in the @entity170 led to the worst nuclear accident in history			2
and in 1994 , @entity173 began its first multi-racial elections , which would lead to @entity175 becoming the country 's first black president			1
@entity178 @entity23 : the @entity128 is threatening penalties			1
@entity181 secretary ban ki - moon is calling for an investigation			2
all of it has to do with what 's going on right now in @entity5			1
people in the city of @entity187 , in southern @entity5 , have been protesting against their government for weeks			1
what we know is that @entity5 military troops went into @entity187 yesterday morning			2
what we do n't know is what exactly happened next			2
some reports , including from the @entity181 , say the military forces just started attacking residents , killing several people			0
but the @entity5 government says residents asked the military to come to @entity187 in order to protect them from supposed terrorists there			1
@entity57 has n't been able to verify the reports out of @entity5 because @entity57 is not allowed inside the country			0
@entity206 @entity23 : this is what @entity6 leader @entity208 's compound looked like after an airstrike hit it yesterday			1
the strike was carried out by @entity206 , the @entity213			0
that 's the group that 's leading the military operation in @entity6			1
@entity206 says the target of the strike was a communications center that colonel @entity208 used to direct attacks against civilians			0
but a @entity6 spokesman said @entity206 was trying to kill @entity208			0
he added , " the message that was sent by @entity206 in the early hours ... was sent to the wrong address , " meaning that the attack missed @entity208			0
he also said the @entity6 leader was still in command of the country			0
@entity228 @entity229 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to ms. @entity232 's students at @entity233 in @entity234 , @entity235 ! according to a famous saying , what is the best medicine ? if you think you know it , then shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity244 , b ) @entity243 , c ) money or @entity248 ) happiness ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity243 is the best medicine			1
that 's how the saying goes , so that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! tv host inspires others @entity23 : it 's an idea that @entity255 is certainly familiar with			1
he 's a comedian and filmmaker , and he 's about to add another title to that resume : tv host			1
but one thing @entity261 says he does n't want to be called is inspirational			0
he might not think so			0
but after watching this report from our dr. @entity264 , you might disagree			0
( begin video ) @entity267 , @entity269 host : i come from a very creative family			0

@entity283 : now , at 26 , he lives in @entity285 and spends his days writing , editing and brainstorming with his production and support team , his friends			0
a year ago , @entity285 -- and really , the rest of the country -- did n't know who @entity267 was			0
and then he decided to enter a contest to become @entity295 's next tv talk show star			1
oprah winfrey , @entity269 host : how old were you when you figured out that you were different than the other kids ? @entity278 : i knew that i had a wheelchair , obviously			0
they did n't shield that from me			0
@entity283 : as a result of the contest , @entity295 gave @entity267 his own travel show , scheduled to air later this year			0
@entity278 : that 's what the travel show is , taking life as it comes			1

@entity283 : and rolling with life 's obstacles , well , that 's just what @entity267 does			1
@entity278 : you got ta have a sense of humor about everything			0
because humor is just pain with perspective			0
@entity283 : you see , @entity267 has cerebral palsy			0

but having @entity328 never stopped him from doing what he wants to do			0
@entity278 : everybody has problems , is what i always say			0
and like , mine are no bigger than anyone else 's			1
and i think that 's the message that i want to get across			1
what i 've got to deal with is really small in the scheme of things			0
@entity283 : @entity267 gives his family a lot of credit for not dwelling on his disability			0
and his tv show wo n't either			0
he hopes some day to be an inspiration to others , but says he is not there yet and has this advice			1
@entity278 : i would say to anybody who feels really like they are bogged down by their obstacles , just really think of who you are without those			1
