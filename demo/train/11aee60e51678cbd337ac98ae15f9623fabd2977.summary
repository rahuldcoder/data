-- @entity2 's death leaves a @entity4 - size hole in pop music			1
though the trio were not the most prolific legends on the landscape ( over the course of 25 years , they released only seven proper albums ) , their impact has been gigantic			2
starting with 1986 ′ s " licensed to @entity21 , " the @entity4 rewrote the rules for commercial hip - hop , the mainstreaming of hardcore punk , the state of sampling , and the treatment of the old school			1
" @entity30 , " one of the early full - lengths released by influential hip - hop label @entity24 , is often referred to as the first rap album to hit no. 1 on the @entity29 albums chart			1
that title is a little unfair , as those sales were powered by the wildfire success of " ( @entity35 ( @entity34 ) " — a track that many at the time considered more rock than rap			2
the remainder of " @entity30 " is pure mid- ' 80s hip - hop : grimy , tricky , and funny			1
the rhyme trading on " @entity44 " was child 's play compared to the exchanges on " @entity47 , " " she 's @entity49 , " and " @entity50			0
" though it is hard to believe now , the @entity4 ' race rarely came up — in part because hip - hop was a new genre , but also because they had the legitimate skills to counter criticism			1
it helped that they kept pushing the form forward on subsequent releases			0
though 1989 ′ s " @entity65 " was a commercial failure at the time , it is now held up as a brilliant piece of art way ahead of its time			0
working with the @entity69 constructed a pastiche that flowed so deftly that it became common for owners of the vinyl to play " @entity73			0
" for djs and genre - bending artists like @entity76 , @entity65 was a keystone holding up a cathedral of sonic possibilities			2
though hip - hop had always incorporated rock samples and toyed with live instrumentation ( @entity82 liked to toss @entity84 records into his break beats ) , " @entity30 " also essentially invented rap - rock			1
" @entity44 " is the obvious example , but @entity89 's @entity88 ( another signee of @entity24 co-founder @entity91 ) also lent some shredding guitar to " @entity93			0
" " @entity98 ' and @entity99 ' " is built around samples from @entity95 , @entity96 , and the @entity97			0
@entity2 's first love was hardcore punk — the early @entity4 were a speedy , noisy act who opened for @entity104 and @entity105			1
those fixations ran through " @entity30 " through the group 's two peak albums , 1992 ′ s " @entity109 " and 1994 ′ s " @entity110			1
" it was n't so much that they brought punk attitude to hip - hop ( @entity115 figured out that trick at the end of the ' 80s ) , but it was about the fact that traditional rock music — and later , jazz — could coexist next to traditional rap			1
over the course of their last three albums — 1998 ′ s " @entity127 , " 2004 ′ s " to the @entity135 , " and last year 's " @entity124 " — the @entity123 looked to be returning to everyone else 's old school , tapping into elements of classic hip - hop that had disappeared as the style became the preeminent movement on pop radio			0
" @entity127 " sounds like a reaction to the @entity137 - fication of rap in the late ' 90s , with its focus on breaking down hip - hop into core sonic elements and executing them with breathtaking precision			2
it 's most evident on the classic call to arms " three mcs and one dj , " but it 's also plastered across tracks like the funky " @entity148 ' , " the minimalist " @entity149 , " and the neck - snapping single " intergalactic			0
" to the 5 boroughs and @entity124 both work to preserve hip - hop 's past rather than trying to innovate , but the trio 's curatorial minds are so sharp that they both act as a living tribute to the @entity158 streets that birthed rap			2
they are reflective , thoughtful albums that leave room for fun			0
you can hear the @entity4 ' influence all over the place , from @entity166 's sonic firebombs to @entity168 's playful genre - bending to the @entity171 crew 's open - minded mix of the serious and the absurd			1
even if @entity2 had n't become an excellent video director , launched an influential film company , created the @entity175 , and worked to assist victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks , he would still be regarded as a legend who deserves serious accolades not just for his musical and cultural impact but for the trails he blazed			2
