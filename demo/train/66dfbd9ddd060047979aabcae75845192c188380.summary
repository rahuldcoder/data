-- it was big news in the tech world -- or at least it would have been if it had been true			2
@entity6 , so the story went , had purchased @entity7 , a @entity8 provider , for $ 400 million			1
some news organizations pounced , with everyone from long - established outlets like @entity12 to new - media tech blogs like @entity14 reporting the news monday			1
but hours later , both companies would deny the story , which @entity17 , a site that distributes press releases for a fee , says was planted by someone falsely claiming to represent @entity7			2
hoaxes have slipped their way into the public eye for as long as journalism has existed			0
but media experts say the way bad information spread so quickly casts a light on how reporting can go wrong in the fast - paced world of web journalism			1
long gone are the days when newspapers and the evening tv news were the only game in town -- when reporters had hours , if not days , to sift through a report before sharing it with the masses			1
in their place is an info - hungry web that wants news now and rewards the quick with a currency of page views , @entity47 links and @entity49 " likes			1
" " with something like this , there are a lot of blogs and websites that build their reputation on the tech world , " said @entity50 , a senior faculty member at the @entity51 , a nonprofit devoted to the study and teaching of journalism			0
" if @entity6 is spending $ 400 million to buy something , there are people who are expected to have something to say about that and they want to be in that mix. " the @entity67 : we just fooled the @entity70 government ! while a rush to get into that mix as quickly as possible probably played a role , @entity50 said there were multiple breakdowns in the @entity6 - @entity7 nonstory			1
the first , obviously , was the person who -- according to @entity78 -- impersonated an @entity7 representative			0
" @entity17 reviews all press releases and follows an internal process designed to maintain the integrity of the releases we send out every day , " the company said in a written statement			1
" even with reasonable safeguards identity theft occurs , on occasion , across all of the major wire services			0
we have removed the fraudulent release and turned the matter over to the proper authorities for further investigation			2
" on thursday , @entity17 ceo @entity97 published a letter apologizing for the gaffe and promising that the company had improved it 's process			1
" it 's clear that we have to hold our service to an ever - higher standard , so @entity17 will continue to evolve , " @entity97 wrote			2
" we will continue to deliver a service that 's valuable to our customers , valuable to our readers and valuable to our distribution and media partners -- and we 'll work tirelessly to deliver on these promises			2
" financial experts say the hoax looks like an illegal effort to inflate @entity7 's meager stock			0
shares , which trade for a fraction of a penny , jumped in price dramatically monday and hundreds of millions of shares changed hands before the stock was frozen			0
@entity7 ceo @entity123 told @entity124 , a @entity0 content partner , that the release apparently originated in @entity126 and was sent from an e-mail account designed to look like an official @entity7 address			2
but the most damning gaffe may have been @entity17 's , @entity50 said			0
acquired by @entity17 in 2006 , pr web aims to compete with the decades - old @entity131 and other press - release outlets			1
" their quality - control process in printing out press releases obviously has some problems , " @entity50 said			2
" it 's not just that they got ' hacked ' -- but that it was a pretty crappy press release			1
" the release had several grammatical errors , included no contact information for representatives of @entity6 or @entity7 , and did n't include biographical information about the companies that is typical in releases from major corporations			1
in a post titled " how @entity151 , " @entity148 of @entity149 searched @entity17 and found one of the @entity153 's ubiquitous " how to buy cheap @entity159 " posts and other content that would seem more at home in a spam e-mail than on a news site			0
the final error , @entity50 said , was on the part of reporters			0
whether racing to publish fast or working on analysis of the supposed purchase , news outlets missed what should have been red flags			1
" journalists who were looking at it should have spotted those same weak spots in the press release and questioned whether it was real or not , " she said			1
" those journalists were relying on pr web to do that and they should n't have			0
" it would be easy to conclude that we 're all going too fast			0
but it could be that we placed way too much trust in pr web ... and assuming it had the same checks and balances and safety nets that other @entity17 wires have			0
" ( full disclosure : last year , this reporter , like others at numerous news outlets , was duped by pranksters who created an entire website for a fictional consulting firm to release a phony survey comparing the @entity195 of users of various web browsers			1
) perhaps helping push the fake @entity7 story , @entity50 said , was the @entity17 's ability to share news stories in real time			2
" once one organization does it , other organizations tend to place even more blind faith , " she said			0
" once the @entity12 ( for example ) does it , then everyone does it			0
" the @entity12 retracted and issued a correction for the story			0
when contacted , an @entity12 spokeswoman referred @entity0 to the wire service 's retraction , which cited @entity7 and " a person close to @entity6 " as saying the original report was untrue			1
@entity14 apologized to its readers , both owning up to the error and appearing to take a shot at @entity17 in the process			0
" we were wrong on this post , for not following up with @entity6 and the other company involved but posting rather than ... waiting on a solid confirmation beforehand from either source , " read an editor 's note atop the original post			1
" we apologize to our readers , to the companies involved , and we 'll be sure to act in a more responsible manner for future stories , rather than trusting the word of a website that does n't necessarily hold itself up to any journalistic standards			0
" @entity234 and @entity235 were among the other news outlets that reported the fake purchase , as were popular tech sites @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245			1
other outlets , like @entity247 and @entity248 , ran the @entity12 account .			0
