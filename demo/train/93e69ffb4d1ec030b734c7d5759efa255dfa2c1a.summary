the self - identified " secret weapon " of the former @entity18 governor 's campaign tweet their campaign observations , appear on national television and recently parodied a controversial web video form rival candidate @entity14			1
most known by their @entity6 handle , @ @entity20 , @entity21 , 26 , @entity22 , 25 , and @entity23 , 22 , who started tweeting to keep their friends updated on their whereabouts , are now attempting to lift the curtain on their dad 's presidential campaign			1
" as we got more and more comfortable using it and being honest in what we were saying , i think a lot of people started tuning in and saying , ' you know , this is our only gateway into what 's really going on in the campaign , ' " @entity22 said to @entity31 after an interview on @entity31 ' " @entity33			1
" some of the tweets have been scrutinized , like one written by @entity23 during a recent foreign policy debate			2
it poked fun at the credentials of the other candidates compared to those of her father , who served as @entity53 ambassador to @entity54 under president @entity55			0
" looks like they do n't need adults in the room			0
@entity60 is enough experience to carry on , " the tweet said			0

" we think our dad had the best haircut , " @entity22 said after a pause , refusing to rise to @entity82 's bait			1

although children of the other candidates have accompanied their parents on the trail , this time around none has done so as consistently or as publicly as the @entity119 daughters			2
@entity3 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity120 said children of presidential candidates are rarely in the limelight and that the spouses usually hold a more important role			0
" they tend to generate more problems than they solve , both for the campaign staff because of tinkering and for the campaign itself because they become a separate story , " @entity120 said of candidate 's mates			1
" @entity2 's daughters are trying to help their dad , but as he is bumping along at between 1 and 3 % , no one is paying much attention to @entity2 or to his daughters , " @entity120 said			1
but @entity2 communications director @entity141 said the campaign is " thrilled " the daughters are " on the trail helping to spread his message			1

@entity22 is " doing a lot of media stuff			2
" " so you know , we do have a big job aside from @entity166 , " @entity21 said			2
when asked about the viability of their father 's presidential bid , they are quick to offer explanations for his low national and statewide poll numbers , cheerily predicting success			0
" he has n't had a chance to have @entity53 see him yet , " @entity21 told @entity82 on wednesday			2
" he is the only candidate that can give @entity55 a run for his money , and we hope that @entity53 can see that eventually			0
" @entity2 acknowledges the potential for mishap looms , but he told @entity0 that his daughters ' success represents new campaign realities			1
" here 's a reality in my life ... i give a major foreign policy speech on @entity53 's role in the world in the 21st century , i get five hits on @entity8			1
the girls put up this cornball video spoofing another candidate 's video , they get half a million views within 24 hours , " @entity2 said			1
" and i say the world is n't fair , but i 'm beginning to understand how political communication works these days			0
" after the @entity14 campaign released a buzzed - about video showing the pizza executive 's mustached chief of staff , @entity205 , taking a long drag on a cigarette , @entity203 released a parody spot of their own			1
equipped with fake mustaches , the three women blew bubbles instead of smoke			0
the video has nearly 300,000 hits on @entity8			2
yes , they 're infusing humor into the campaign , but @entity22 also stressed the serious side of their message			1
" we 're doing this to introduce our dad to @entity53 , " she told @entity82			0
" i think the campaign trusts us ... and they know that we 're only out there to really get his message out as best as we can			0
