from the rooftop of a mosque in the @entity4 district of @entity5 , i watched as thousands of supporters of deposed @entity8 president @entity7 frantically waved posters and chanted angrily			1
moments before they heard that the man who , just a year ago , had been declared @entity8 's first ever democratically elected president had been ousted			1
the people who had jammed into @entity14 on june 30 , 2012 to celebrate his inauguration were shocked and enraged			0
when long - serving president @entity18 was toppled from power two and a half years ago , it was the beginning , not the end , of a revolution that has yet to run its course			1
prior to 2011 , the presumption among many @entity8 and foreign observers alike was that the long - suffering people of @entity8 had an almost bottomless reserve of patience , that as long as they could feed their families , they would put up with whoever was in power			1
the uprising that banished @entity18 unleashed energy and a passion that shows no sign of diminishing			1
if @entity7 thought his election victory a year ago , in which he won 51.7 % of the vote , was a mandate , he was sorely mistaken			1
but @entity7 's head never lay steady atop the state			1
the police never trusted him -- nor did @entity43			0
the army was suspicious and the business community dubious			0
many voted for @entity7 simply because they saw him as the lesser of two evils , running against former @entity18 stalwart @entity48			1
one activist i spoke to , who only gave his name as @entity52 , compared the two candidates during the presidential elections			0
" you have two drugs , " he told me			0
" one , @entity48 kills you , and the other , @entity7 , gives you a bad stomach ache			1
they 're both bad , but @entity7 's drug is light			1
it does n't kill you			0
so we 'll give @entity7 four years			2
if he does n't work out , we 'll come back to @entity14 and bring him down			0
" @entity52 's words , spoken in june 2012 , were prophetic			2
analysis : what is @entity65 ? the night before the massive @entity68 demonstrations on june 30 , in a packed @entity14 , i found people already convinced their president of just one year was soon to be history			2
" he 's out , he 's over , he 's finished , " one man shouted to me			2
" we 've gone downhill all the way in that year , economically , security wise , " said @entity74 , a businessman			0
they 've split @entity8 in two , islamists and @entity81			2
we 're all @entity82 and we 're all believers			0
our conflict was a political conflict			0
they 're switched it to a religious conflict			0
" many @entity8 were deeply offended that @entity7 and the @entity65 put their identity as @entity82 before their identity as @entity8			1
this is a country profoundly proud of its rich heritage , and quick to take offense at those who seem to disregard its place in history			0
last november , many were appalled when a @entity65 radical , @entity98 , appeared on talk show on a private tv channel and declared if he and his ilk ever came to power they would destroy some of @entity8 's most revered monuments			1
during the program , he claimed he took part in the demolition of @entity109 's @entity108 statues in march 2001			2
the show 's host , @entity115 asked , " so you would destroy the sphinx and the pyramids ? " @entity98 : " yes , we will destroy them , if they were worshiped before or afterwards			2
" one guest , clearly repulsed , told @entity98 , " you do n't know the history of your country well			0
the pharaohs were the first to know religion in the world			0
" @entity130 and the pyramids , he continued , " are mankind 's heritage and not the property of the @entity8 alone , they are the property of all mankind			1
" although neither @entity136 , nor the @entity65 , ever advocated such a course of action , many questioned their intentions and accused the brotherhood of harboring barely concealed intent to turn @entity8 into a @entity144 - style @entity143 state			1
that was an intangible complaint			0
the economy withered under @entity7 , as @entity8 suffered through frequent and prolonged power cuts and fumed in long lines outside petrol stations			1
@entity7 's promises of prosperity and security never materialized			1
the country 's powerful army , responding to the millions in the street , forced @entity7 from power on the evening of july 3			1
but in the brave , new @entity8 , no one gives up without a fight			2
the celebrations in @entity14 were mirrored by angry demonstrations outside @entity163 and in @entity5			0
" no one is going to take our vote , " a woman shouted to me in front of the university			0
" these are legitimate elections , " exclaimed her husband			0
" all the people have approved his legitimacy			0
he is our legitimate president			2
how can he [ defense minister @entity171 ] take this from us ? " @entity7 's sudden transformation , from president of the @entity8 , to prisoner , reminded me of something newspaper editor @entity180 had told me just one year before , on the eve of @entity7 's victory			1
@entity8 , he said , now " have a sense of their own rights			2
they have a sense of their personal dignity			0
they perceive themselves as citizens and this is something that is new for an old guy like me			0
they look at the state as their servant and not their master			1
" @entity7 , their servant , did a bad job so they fired him			1
the real revolution in @entity8 is not in the streets			1
it 's in the mind .			0

@entity209 : president @entity18 's *removal* marked start of revolution yet to run its course
uprising unleashed energy and a passion that shows no sign of diminishing
for many president @entity7 failed to deliver on promises so he had to go
*journalist* : @entity8 now look at the state as their servant and not their master
