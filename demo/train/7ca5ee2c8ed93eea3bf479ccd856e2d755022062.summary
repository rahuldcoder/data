one daily newspaper in @entity2 asked who had the more dazzling engagement ring -- @entity6 's fiancee or @entity8 's future wife			1
but when @entity6 and @entity8 met thursday for a spot in the final of the @entity14 , it was the @entity15 who was a cut above his @entity19 opponent			1
@entity6 reached a fourth final in @entity21 when he beat @entity8 6 - 7 ( 6 ) 6 - 0 6 - 3 7 - 5 in an ill - tempered affair , meaning he is on the verge of winning a third grand slam title and first since he ended @entity26 's nearly 80 - year drought at @entity27 in 2013			1
@entity6 complained to chair umpire @entity28 about something @entity8 said after the first set ended and @entity8 did n't appear pleased at @entity6 's reaction when the 2010 @entity27 finalist dropped his serve at 5 - 3 in the first			1
television cameras also seemed to show @entity6 's fiancee , @entity35 , mouthing an obscenity towards @entity8 or his camp -- which included @entity38 , who used to coach @entity6 -- during the match			1
" when there 's a lot of tension surrounding something , which you created , then it 's completely normal that the whole first set everyone was tight , " @entity6 told reporters , taking a swipe at the media			1
" my physical trainer , physio , i 'm sure for @entity38 it was uncomfortable			0
" even @entity8 , who very rarely says anything on the court , there was tension there for him , as well			2
yeah in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret			0
" it would n't be the first time a player 's partner taunted an opponent -- and @entity67 's wife , @entity66 , seemed to do it to defending @entity14 champion @entity69 at the @entity70 in november			1
regardless , @entity8 downplayed talk of bad blood between him and @entity6			1
he said he was simply trying to pump himself up after winning the first set			0
" i say to myself , ' well done , @entity74			0
' that 's it , " @entity8 told reporters			1
" i think i 'm allowed to do that when i win a set			0
" i pumped myself up ... and that 's it , then sit on the chair			2
i 'm not really looking left or right what 's going on			0
i just keep focusing myself and that 's it			0
" there is no really big deal about anything what was happening today on the court			0
i mean , it was a great battle			0
it was a good match			0
unfortunately with a bad end for me			0
" @entity8 upset 14 - time grand slam champion @entity92 in the quarterfinals and he picked up where he left off in the semifinals , using his effortless power to break for 5 - 3			2
but after he was broken straight back , things swung in @entity6 's favor despite @entity8 claiming the roughly 80 - minute first set			1
@entity8 's intensity dropped and so did his first - serve percentage			2
@entity6 , meanwhile , upped his game , stepping up the attack from the baseline and playing his sublime defense when needed			2
he pointed to his own camp , which featured coach @entity107 , when the match ended			0
" i got asked all the time about my ex-coach working with @entity74 and no one was interested in anything i was doing with @entity107 or the way i was playing or anything , " @entity6 said			2
@entity6 can now sit back and watch friday 's other semifinal between top - seed @entity116 and @entity69			1
@entity116 is attempting to win a fifth @entity14 title			1
he downed @entity118 in the 2011 and 2013 finals .			0

@entity6 makes a fourth @entity14 final
he defeats @entity8 in four sets in @entity21
@entity6 will face either @entity116 or @entity69
