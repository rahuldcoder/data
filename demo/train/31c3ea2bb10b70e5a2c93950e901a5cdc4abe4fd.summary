-- the @entity4 runner who was lost in a forest for three days without water had barely a few hours to go before she would have died , her doctor said thursday			1
@entity7 , 36 , survived for three days without water in a @entity4 forest			1
@entity10 , 36 , not only survived 72 hours with only a slice of apple in her stomach and a little bit of water for nourishment , she also has only one functioning kidney , dr. @entity9 said			1
he spoke with @entity0 on thursday afternoon , along with @entity10 and her husband , @entity17 , in a conference call interview from her room at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity4			1
@entity10 is no amateur when it comes to distance or mountain running			1
she 's one of the top female finishers in a @entity26 100 - mile race and an experienced ultrarunner with top times in other 100 - mile and 50 - mile races			2
her body was unusually strong to begin with , but she also has one kidney -- the other does n't function because of a congenital disorder			2
" this is extraordinary , " @entity34 said			2
she said she had planned a simple eight - mile run , a small fraction of what the ultrarunner usually tackles in a sport that challenges competitors to run at least farther than a 26.2 - mile marathon			2
she is among the majority of ultrarunners who like doing 100 - mile races			2
she set out from her @entity47 home at 5:30 a.m. sunday to meet @entity48 , her running partner and brother - in - law , who is also a serious ultrarunner			1
they planned to run along a trail in the the @entity53 near @entity26			1
she brought along two water bottles and wore a @entity55 , a backpack that can be filled with water			1
that was plenty of water for an eight - mile outing			1
she did n't bring food with her , but @entity10 said she ate a piece of apple before she started , and that was the only food in her stomach			1
@entity10 said she did several things that were out of character that day , and she wishes she had been more prepared			2
" i am very careful usually , but that particular day , i was not , " she said			2
" i normally , the night before the long runs , i have everything ready			2
and this night , i had nothing ready , and it was just a mistake			2
" she usually wears a @entity71 gps watch , a sophisticated device that runners use to find out where they are , the distance they have traveled , calories burned and altitude			2
" i did n't have my @entity71 and was n't wearing a watch , " she said			2
" i do n't know			0
i always carry food with me , and i did n't have nearly enough			1
" " i always carry my phone with me , and i did n't have my phone with me , and that really was a big mistake , " she said			0
feeling antsy to just get on the trail and run , she was n't thinking deliberately			0
" i just wanted to get going that day ; get some fresh air and go for a run			0
" @entity10 and @entity48 began running about 6:30 a.m. sunday , she said			1
she lost track of as much as eight hours , she said , as she and @entity48 became lost			1
by then , she was dehydrated and disoriented			0
and @entity10 said she also made another , more serious bad decision			0
at some point in the run , @entity48 had become ill. @entity90 is a sport in which some participants sometimes push themselves way too hard			0
" [ he was ] pretty much beside me or in front of me , but i do know that i was insisting on keeping going since i was ok , " she said			0
" he does n't eat or drink much ever [ when out on runs ] , so i know he can handle that			0
" she said that she kept going because she 'd seen him run hard while sick -- also not uncommon in 50 - and 100 - mile races -- and that she figured he could handle it if she pushed him			0
she said they became separated as they two were going over a rugged hill			0
" we had separated because we were going through a hill quite a while and had to go through brush , and that 's how i have a lot of scrapes			0
so that was very difficult , " she said			0
" [ @entity110 ] crawl under and break branches , and that was the only way we were going to get out of there , according to @entity48			0
so i do n't think he was able to see that i was not there anymore			0
" she said that @entity48 was in front of her			0
he would shout to her so they knew the other one was close by : he shouted to her , and she shouted back			0
then , at one point , she could n't hear him anymore			0
" when i called him and he did n't answer , at this point , i lost a little bit of control , " she said			1
she had no water or food , and she did n't try to eat anything			1
she became disoriented but had the wherewithal to know that she was completely out of fuel			0
she did n't have the strength to keep walking , so she climbed into a ravine , believing that would be the safest place			1
@entity48 was not available for an interview thursday			0
he was found wednesday several hours before she was			1
it 's not clear why he was lost for so long and where , for days , he had traveled in the forest			1
rather than ask for water , law enforcement said , @entity48 asked how @entity10 was doing and if someone had found her			1
" i really had to , from the beginning , accept that i was not capable of getting out of there , there was no where to go , " she said , recalling her hours in the ravine , thinking about her husband and her family			1
she told herself she would live			0
" i knew what i had to do			0
" the experience has not scared her away from distance running on trails			1
when her kidney is strong again , she will be back , running .			1

@entity152 , 36 , had no food or water for days
she and her running partner say they got lost in @entity53
she was found in a ravine wednesday by a rescue *helicopter*
