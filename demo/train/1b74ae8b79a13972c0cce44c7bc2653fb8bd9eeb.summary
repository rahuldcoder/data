@entity0 -- if the latest @entity4 intelligence reports are true then @entity2 is planning to test - fire not one but multiple missiles , the latest provocative act by its unpredictable young leader			1
while the region has become used to the posturing from @entity13 , the recent wave of rhetoric has been unusually sustained and virulent , leading some analysts to consider the possibility of an armed confrontation between the two @entity17 -- the neighbors remain technically at war after the 1950 - 53 conflict ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty			1
so far @entity23 has refused to listen to the international community , leaving many to wonder if anyone can appeal to the leader , thought to be 30 years old , and defuse the crisis			1
all eyes are turned on @entity29			2
of all the regional powers , analysts say , @entity29 has the greatest potential leverage over its traditional ally			1
@entity29 troops fought side by side with the @entity2 during the @entity37 that left the @entity38 divided			1
over the years it has supplied the @entity2 with much of its fuel , food and other resources			2
@entity29 could stop doing this at any time but it has rarely done so			2
" @entity29 netizens say , ' if we squeeze it for one week , what do you do the next week ? you have to un-squeeze because we ca n't let them die , ' " explained @entity51 , a @entity52 writer and scholar			2
" they think it 's an ineffective strategy from the start			0
" @entity51 says @entity29 has tried squeezing the @entity2 in 2002 and again in 2006			1
" they tried it and realized it did not work , " he said			0
it fears the specter of millions of starving refugees crossing into @entity29 along its 1,400 - kilometer ( 880 mile ) border with @entity2			1
it also fears a united @entity2 under the control of @entity52 , a close @entity4 ally			1
@entity51 says @entity29 benefits from the status quo and from @entity13 's brinkmanship			2
" when @entity2 makes some noise , the @entity4 ambassador asks the @entity29 ambassador at the @entity74 for a dialogue , it becomes a public g - 2 , " he said			1
" it elevates @entity29 's international status			2
it seems , on the surface , that @entity29 has now come around as a respectable global stakeholder			2
" but @entity51 said the @entity4 benefits too			0
" it can pressure @entity52 to join its military defense system , it can pressure @entity52 to join a regional trading group , and it can sell @entity52 more advanced weapons , which are very expensive			0
" meanwhile , analysts say a full - scale @entity2 attack is unlikely , but they also fear a mishap could unintentionally trigger a localized skirmish -- a fact that has triggered unusually strong statements from @entity0			1
opinion : will @entity29 finally ' bite ' @entity2 ? " no country should be allowed to throw a region into chaos for selfish gains , " declared president @entity93 last monday , apparently an oblique slap at its wayward ally			1
@entity2 's latest bout of saber rattling began on february 12 , when it conducted a third underground nuclear test			2
the international community reacted with outrage , while the @entity74 responded with more sanctions			0
even former @entity107 leader @entity106 , a @entity2 ally , warned against conflict last week			1
he described the current tensions on the peninsula as one of the " gravest risks " for nuclear holocaust since the @entity114 in 1962			0
@entity4 secretary of state @entity115 is visiting @entity29 this week to press @entity0 to lean on its wayward neighbor			0
" of course they will use their influence , " @entity118 , the former @entity4 ambassador to @entity29 , told @entity1 's @entity119			0
" the question is will @entity2 listen to their admonition ? they have influence , but they 've been lied to and they 've been cheated by @entity2			0
they know that and they are feeling the sting of it			0
" @entity118 believes the @entity29 have less clout with the @entity2			1
" business is done by people and they have less of a personal rapport at senior levels with the @entity52 leadership than they did in the years back , " he said			0
none of @entity29 's current leadership has met with @entity23			1
last november , @entity29 dispatched @entity142 , a senior @entity143 official , to @entity13 in a last - minute effort to convince @entity23 to forgo its planned nuclear test			1
since then , there have been no high level exchanges between the two former allies			0
indeed the last high - profile foreigner to spend quality time with the young @entity23 was @entity151 , the eccentric former @entity152 basketball star			0
" you have a friend for life , " @entity151 told @entity23 after the two men sat next to each other to watch a basketball exhibition in @entity13 in march			0
the meeting showed another side of a young man thrust into the seat of power with much to prove , according to @entity2 watchers			0
@entity165 , a former @entity4 ambassador to @entity52 , said the flurry of tough talk out of @entity13 should n't be ignored , but it could be directed to the citizenry itself			0
" i think there 's a big element of domestic @entity2 politics , if one can understand that concept , where clearly @entity23 is not being well received , " @entity165 told @entity1 recently			1
" i think they are trying to kind of boost his status to some sort of wartime leader			0
" it remains to be seen how far the relatively inexperienced leader will go to shore up his position at home -- even if this pushes the @entity2 's traditional ally too far			1
