-- @entity2 , @entity1 , @entity3 , @entity4 , and other brightly colored foods designed to appeal to children are n't exactly health food			0
but do they make kids hyperactive ? doctors and consumer advocates have long wondered whether hyperactivity might be tied to certain dyes and additives used in processed foods , but in decades of research no studies have been able to conclusively prove -- or disprove -- such a link			2
now , the @entity19 is formally weighing the evidence , raising the possibility that the agency may eventually strengthen its regulation of these ingredients			1
in a two - day meeting beginning wednesday , an @entity19 advisory committee will discuss the strength of the evidence surrounding food dyes and behavior changes in children , whether food labels should be changed to better protect consumers , and whether more studies on the subject need to be conducted			1
( the @entity19 is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees , but it usually does			2
) @entity0 : 9 food additives that may affect @entity38 the debate over the potential effects of food dyes has been simmering since the 1970s			1
why is the @entity19 acting now ? the main impetus appears to be a 2008 petition from a @entity45 , @entity45 - based watchdog group , the @entity44 , which asked the @entity19 to ban eight different food dyes including @entity47 -- found in macaroni - and - cheese mixes , lemon - lime @entity49 , @entity52 cereal , and many other foods			1
the @entity19 reviewed the petition and , in september 2010 , decided that color additives did n't directly cause hyperactivity or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , a condition characterized by chronic attention and behavioral problems			2
however , it did n't rule out that they might exacerbate preexisting problems in children with @entity38			0
@entity0 : what causes adhd ? 12 myths and facts no one knows what the @entity19 committee will decide , but the research so far " does n't appear to be conclusive evidence that food additives actually cause @entity38 , " says @entity73 , cofounder of the @entity74 , an independent research group based in @entity75 , @entity76			1
" some research suggests that they may be linked to exacerbated symptoms in people who already have adhd			0
" tying hyperactivity to specific food dyes or additives is especially difficult , @entity73 adds , because " most products contain more than one			1
" indeed , some types of candy contain as many as 10			0
a long - standing debate the first inkling that food additives might be linked to attention problems arose more than three decades ago , when @entity93 pediatrician @entity92 , @entity94 , developed a diet free of artificial dyes and flavorings that supposedly quelled hyperactive symptoms in children			1
many people enthusiastically tried the so - called @entity101 , but the enthusiasm waned as the years went on and " some very well - done randomized controlled studies " questioned @entity92 's theory , says @entity105 , @entity106 , the director of the @entity107 at the @entity108 -- @entity109			0
" i do n't think there was a great deal of evidence suggesting that withdrawing food dyes and food additives were helping those children , " @entity110 says			1
" for a very small subset of kids there might have been an indication but , for the vast majority , not eating cookies with that frosting with the red dye in it did n't make a difference			0
" @entity0 : 10 kid - targeted junk foods more recently , a pair of government - funded studies in the @entity131 revived interest in the link between food dyes and behavioral problems			1
in one study , published in 2004 , researchers found that a diet free of artificial colorings and the preservative sodium benzoate appeared to reduce hyperactive behavior among preschoolers			0
in the other , published in the @entity145 in 2007 , preschool and grade - school children seemed to be more hyperactive when given a juice drink with these same additives than they were after consuming an otherwise identical , additive - free drink			0
both of these studies -- which inspired the @entity44 's petition to the @entity19 -- marked a departure from previous research in that they looked at children without @entity38 who were not suspected of being sensitive to food additives			1
" those studies were not definitive , but they extended the concern from children with behavioral issues to the general population , " says @entity156 , @entity106 , executive director of the @entity44			0
" almost every other study used as subjects children who were hyperactive or inattentive or suspected of being sensitive to dyes			0
" @entity0 : are food dyes really safe ? could food dyes be banned ? last year , the @entity167 placed warning labels on food containing the six artificial colors used in the @entity145 study ( three of which are not approved in the @entity174 )			1
and in 2009 , the @entity131 counterpart to the @entity19 , the @entity176 , asked food companies to voluntarily phase out these additives			2
the @entity19 has not said that it is prepared to take similar steps			2
and because food dyes are more prevalent here than in @entity183 , an outright ban on some or all of the additives would be very difficult to implement , @entity156 says			1
however , some food manufacturers are proactively reducing their use of food dyes and other additives , and some retailers are declining to stock products containing artificial coloring			1
@entity194 , for instance , has had such a policy in place since the 1980s , says @entity197 , quality standards coordinator for the company			0
@entity0 : quiz : do you have adult adhd ? the food industry , meanwhile , has defended the safety of its products			0
" [ added ] colors are safe and play an important technological role in foods			0
in many cases they replace color that 's lost during processing or for consistent appearance , for instance , " says @entity208 , @entity106 , the scientific director of the @entity209 , a trade association representing food - dye makers			0
" specifically , relating to hyperactivity studies , our association strongly supports sound scientific approaches to understanding any effects of any type with food additives , " adds @entity208 , who is scheduled to address the advisory committee on thursday			2
" what we see right now is no clear causal relationship with these studies and [ feel that ] there is n't enough information here for the @entity19 to establish a clear causal relationship			2
