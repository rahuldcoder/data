@entity0 -- thursday , december 13 , may have been one of the luckiest days of @entity4 's life			1
it may not feel that way now since she had to set aside for the moment her longtime dream of becoming secretary of state			1
but it is one thing to be secretary of state in theory and it will be quite another to be @entity15 's top diplomat during the next several years			1
@entity17 , it must be said , was cheated out of a job for which she was well - qualified by a broken political system in @entity0			2
she became a pawn in the campaign battle between the president she has ably served at the @entity25 for the past four years and republicans who sought to make her a scapegoat for the tragic mess that took place in @entity31 on september 11			2
she did nothing wrong except to do what an administration spokesperson is supposed to do , present the unclassified facts of the case as they were known and as her colleagues in the @entity40 , intelligence and diplomatic communities concluded they ought to be presented			2
@entity41 ' extremely upset ' with @entity17 's withdrawal sen. @entity43 led the effort to block her possible nomination as secretary of state with the assistance of colleagues like sens. @entity50 and @entity51			1
the fact that this forced @entity17 to submit a letter to the president withdrawing her nomination reflects the amount of power our system gives even one or two senators who are intent on blocking or dragging out a nomination			0
it may be a testimony to @entity43 's influence and his tenacity			1
it will certainly not be seen as a high water mark in his distinguished career			0
his opposition was petty , partisan , disproportionate to the facts of the @entity31 case that he used to frame his opposition , and inconsistent with the spirit that should prevail when a president presents or even floats his choice for a job as one of his top advisers			2
@entity17 withdraws from consideration as secretary of state what the withdrawal of the @entity17 nomination was not was a sign of presidential weakness			1
quite the contrary , the decision by the @entity40 to accept @entity17 's withdrawal from consideration and allow her to remain as @entity15 ambassador to the @entity25 showed considerably more wisdom and public - spiritedness than was evinced at any time by the opposition			1
great international challenges loom for the @entity15			1
to subject the country to a long drawn - out confirmation battle simply to prove who has the upper hand and in so doing to potentially weaken the eventual occupant of the office @entity103 was the first to hold would be of no benefit to anyone in the @entity15			1
the president had other good choices and would have access to the advice and service of @entity17 from her post at the @entity25 he did n't blink			0
he kept his eye on the ball			0
now , it seems likely that sometime in the next few days , the president will nominate someone else to the @entity121 job			2
it is rumored that person may be sen. @entity124 of @entity125			0
@entity124 , chairman of the @entity126 , is among the most qualified possible candidates for the job and would have no problem getting confirmed			2
@entity43 , in fact , is a close friend of his			1
whoever gets the nod , however , may someday wish they did not			0
for one thing , the next secretary of state has very big shoes to fill			1
@entity138 has been exceptional in the job , leading a remarkable resurgence in @entity15 diplomacy , playing a central role in helping to restore @entity15 's standing in the world , being an architect of resetting this country 's international priorities from the pivot to @entity149 to the recognition of the importance of emerging powers worldwide , from embracing the power of new information age tools of diplomacy to continuing her lifelong effort to win greater equality for women and other disenfranchised populations			1
there 's an old saying in @entity0 that one secret to job success is picking the right predecessor and in that respect , whoever is next has a tough act to follow			1
more daunting by far is the world that will confront the next secretary			2
not only do we face a situation in the greater @entity175 that may be more dangerous than it has been at any time in history , but in case after case , @entity15 's leverage is weak , our options are lousy and our enemies are well - positioned			1
opinion : an unfair portrait of @entity4 @entity183 was a vital partner for peace and is now , at best , a question mark			1
its new leader , @entity187 , has shown a propensity for authoritarianism and the group he represents , the @entity191 , has extremist elements within it that many in the region fear may be inclined to help spread unrest to other moderate states like @entity198 or some of those in the @entity200			0
president @entity201 may be teetering in @entity202 but the chaos that will follow his fall is likely to be as great as is our uncertainty about the motives and capabilities of many in the opposition			2
@entity211 continues to taunt the world with its seemingly relentless drive to acquire nuclear weapons and it may be that in the next year the @entity15 will be confronted by the question of whether we are willing to use military force to stop them			1
@entity219 losing control but showing no signs of leaving @entity222 and @entity223 were challenging during the past four years to be sure			0
but president @entity224 was elected essentially to get out of these places and he made great strides in both in that respect			1
but now comes the hard part			0
in @entity222 , the regime we have supported has been far too close to @entity211 , corrupt and may not be able to hold the country together			0
in @entity223 , we may find that the only way to leave the country with a semi-stable government is to give substantial power to members of the @entity238 , the group we sought to get rid of when we invaded the country			0
neighboring @entity242 , with scores of nuclear weapons , a massive , struggling population and uncertain politics , is considered by many to be the most dangerous place in the world			0
we may have gotten @entity248 and other @entity250 leaders , but the terror network and others are resurgent , gaining strength across the @entity175 and spreading into @entity254			0
@entity224 's cabinet : who 's in , who 's out ? @entity258 continues to struggle with its severe economic problems			1
@entity260 has lurched into recession again			0
@entity262 is testing long - range missiles			0
@entity260 and @entity264 are nose to nose in a dispute over contested islands			0
@entity264 itself is not only a rising rival but a vital economic partner , a place presenting equal portions of opportunity and risk			0
further , the @entity264 leadership is new and will be testing the @entity15 and , at the same time , using whatever measures it must to maintain stability at home			1
@entity280 is causing trouble in @entity202			0
we have great domestic challenges at home			0
we have done nothing to address global warming and the consequences are becoming ever more apparent			2
our international institutions are as weak as we long ago designed them to be and there is little appetite to make them stronger even though the proliferation , climate , trade , financial and health challenges we face all strongly suggest they must be			0
while @entity15 itself may be entering a resurgent period , our recovery is likely to be fragile and clearly , as the @entity17 incident and the fiscal cliff clown show illustrate , @entity0 is bereft of the ability to do even the minimum we might expect of it			1
none of this means calamity is certain			0
none of this assures @entity15 decline			1
i for one , believe the @entity15 will be the world 's sole superpower for many decades to come			1
but what it does mean is that over the next four years we will face extraordinary challenges worldwide and at home			0
and for those reasons , it may well be that being the next secretary of state will be every bit as great a trial as it is an honor			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity326 .			2

@entity326 : @entity4 may be lucky not to *achieve* her dream of becoming secretary of state
he says whoever gets the job faces a bleak prospect of dealing with @entity15 global woes
@entity138 will be a difficult act to follow as the nation 's chief diplomat , he says
@entity326 : @entity224 made the right call here ; @entity43 got it wrong
