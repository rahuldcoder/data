@entity0 -- forty - two years after a police raid sparked rioting and perhaps the birth of the @entity6 gay rights movement , @entity0 rejoiced at their city 's annual pride parade sunday in celebration of same - sex couples ' newly - acquired right to wed. the parade , or march , meandered along @entity15 's @entity14 and passed in front of the famous @entity17 in @entity18 , where the rioting took place in 1969			1
gov. @entity20 signed a bill into law on friday that made @entity0 the sixth state to legalize same - sex marriage , more than doubling the number of @entity6 living in states that permit such unions			1
the measure will take effect 30 days after it was signed , on july 24 , providing same - sex couples with a slew of new rights that include employer health benefits , easier inheritance and a host of state tax breaks			1
federal recognition , however , was not a part of friday 's vote , leaving benefits like @entity41 and ease of immigration largely out of reach for same - sex couples			1
marching with supporters on sunday , @entity20 told reporters that the country looks to @entity0 as a guide for many of its progressive politics			1
" the point of civil rights laws is to protect everybody -- both the people who look like us or who we relate to and the people who do n't , " said @entity51 , a professor at @entity0 's @entity52			1
" the point of a parade that celebrates gay pride is to make room for all people who identify themselves as gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender			2
" the controversial bill passed a @entity70 - controlled @entity69 before reaching @entity20 's desk , in an extended legislative session that left many skeptical over whether lawmakers would bring the measure to a vote			1
its passage also sparked sharp criticism from opposition lawmakers , who warned of potential lawsuits against religious institutions -- a question that delayed deliberations and ultimately resulted in an amendment to the bill to protect religious groups from litigation			1
religious leaders also cautioned against the wider implications of redefining the legal parameters of marriage			2
" we worry that both marriage and the family will be undermined by this tragic presumption of government in passing this legislation that attempts to redefine these cornerstones of civilization , " the state 's @entity93 bishops said in a joint statement released late friday			1
it was signed by archbishop @entity104 and seven other bishops			0
asked what his message was for the gay community , @entity104 said sunday morning , " i tell the gay community i love you very much , and every single morning when i say my prayers , i pray for ( the ) health and happiness of everyone in @entity0			1
" i 'm very sorry that our opponents succeeded in reducing this to anti-gay sentiment , " he said			0
it 's pro-marriage , it 's not anti-gay			1
" but , he said , there was " sadness and disappointment " when the bill passed			0
" we as @entity128 would oppose any attempt by anybody to redefine marriage , " @entity104 said			0
" we do n't believe marriage can be changed or radically altered to accommodate any lifestyle			0
if anything i 've said would lead you to believe i have nothing but love and respect , then i apologize			0
" the bill passed by a narrow 33 - 29 vote -- a first for a @entity70 - led @entity69			2
meanwhile , those in attendance for sunday 's parade were largely one - sided in their perspective			2
" i think it 's better because there should be equality , " said @entity146 , 17 , who was visiting @entity0 from @entity147 , @entity148			2
" at the end of the day , we 're all human beings			0
" " i think it 's awesome , " said @entity154 , 49 , who traveled to @entity0 from @entity155 , @entity156 , for the parade			1
" this is number six and there will be many more to come			0
" " it 's a total breakthrough , " said @entity162 , 22 , of @entity163 , @entity0 , who stood beside her partner as they cheered on marchers			2
" there 's so many people who have been together for years			0
it 's about time they get married			0
" asked whether she and her partner will marry , @entity162 said , " anything 's possible now			0
" others traveled from abroad to attend sunday 's events			0
" this is hugely important , " said @entity175 , 44 , who traveled from @entity176 specifically to watch the city 's annual parade			2
" it 's good to see a big state like @entity0 finally get this sort of thing into law			1
" whether or not friday 's vote reflects new momentum and the national model that @entity20 projects , it seemed that many still had a lot to cheer about during the city 's annual parade			0
@entity1 's @entity193 contributed to this report .			0
