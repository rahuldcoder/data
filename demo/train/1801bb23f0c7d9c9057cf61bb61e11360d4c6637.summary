i feel like we accomplished the purpose of our campaign			2
" @entity57 , who has taken the wheel before in defiance of the ban , said she was worried about what might happen before she drove saturday but now plans to keep doing it			1
she said she believed more women would drive in the days to come			2
photographer : taken to police station while @entity24 police said no one was taken to police stations , that was n't the case in @entity71 , said photographer @entity72			1
she said she was detained in the evening for having driven and taken to a police station , where there was another woman who had been stopped for driving			1
@entity76 said she was later released			0
" i thought i was going to take an uneventful drive around the neighborhood to solidify my reasoning that it 's not against the law , simply against the current customs of our country , " @entity76 told @entity20			0
men she believes to be police informants spotted and followed her , she said			0
she pulled over and called her driver to take her back home , but police appeared and she had to go to the station			2
" we were treated with respect and treated so professionally , " @entity76 said			0
" we described how we were not part of any demonstration , that we ... felt it was our right			0

@entity71 police could not be immediately reached for comment			1
@entity105 : laws will be enforced asked if any women were observed or stopped from driving , or if there was an increased police presence on the streets of major cities , @entity1 's @entity105 spokesman @entity107 said it was a " normal day , just like every saturday			1
" he added , " i am not aware of any violation			0
usually regional police spokesmen would speak to media about any , if any violation takes place			0
" @entity1 's @entity105 issued a warning earlier in the week to women caught driving and anyone taking part in demonstrations			1
without outlining how laws would be applied and what punishment might be doled out to offenders , @entity107 said then , " all violations will be dealt with -- whether demonstrations or women driving			0
" he added , " not just on the 26th			0

several @entity1 women supporting the campaign said they received threatening calls thursday from men claiming to represent the @entity105 , according to women 's rights activists who requested anonymity			1
the callers warned the women not to drive before , on or after saturday , the activists said			2
initially , @entity107 denied any calls were made			0

' @entity158 ' to detain women for driving @entity160 , a @entity1 researcher for @entity161 , told @entity20 via e-mail that the @entity1 @entity105 was trying to " deflate the momentum " behind the campaign through " direct , individual intimidation			1
" he called on @entity1 to end discrimination and allow women to go about their business			1
" it is shameful that a woman could be detained for activity that is n't illegal , " he said			0
" the @entity105 claims it is against ' activities that disturb public peace , ' but pulling over and arresting activists merely for practicing their rights is a far greater threat to public peace than merely getting behind the wheel			0
" one of those spearheading the driving campaign is activist @entity182 , who was jailed for more than a week in 2011 after posting a video of herself driving			0
@entity184 , who now lives in the @entity185 , said it is a positive sign that the government stated its position on women driving			0
" they kept telling the world that the women 's driving issue was one for @entity1 society to decide upon , " she said			2
" society is now showing it is supportive of the idea of women driving			0
the government 's reaction makes it very clear this is not a societal decision			0
this is a political decision			0

the campaign quickly gained momentum , with its online petition garnering more than 16,000 signatures despite the kingdom 's restrictions on protests			0
the online initiative was boosted by the fact that residents of @entity1 are highly active on social media and @entity16			2
