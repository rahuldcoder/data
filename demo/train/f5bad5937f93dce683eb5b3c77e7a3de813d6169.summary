-- @entity1 began his @entity3 title defense talking about donkey cheese , but he ended it with the perfect start to his preseason preparations			1
the world @entity7 retained his title in the @entity11 exhibition event on saturday , beating 11th - ranked @entity12 in a three - set final that should have blown away any remaining rustiness following his demolition of another @entity15 , @entity16 , in the semis			1
@entity1 will now head to @entity18 for another warmup event , the mixed teams @entity20 , where he will line up with glamor girl @entity21 in @entity23 's opening rubber against @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity26 on monday			1
the 25 - year - old on thursday denied claims that he has bought the world 's entire supply of donkey cheese for his restaurant business back home			2
" i did not expect this story was going to get so much attention , and everywhere in the world too , " he told the @entity34 ahead of his first match at the @entity36			0
" there is a certain farm in @entity23 that produces it and , as i understand it , it is the only farm in the world to do so , which is very interesting			1
" they came to our restaurant and offered co-operation , so that is all			0
we are now thinking and seeing what we can do with that , but it is not true that i already bought the whole supply			0
" @entity54 champion @entity1 had to fight hard against @entity12 -- who was a late replacement for the ill @entity56			1
he finally triumphed 6 - 7 ( 4 - 7 ) 6 - 3 6 - 4 in two hours and 35 minutes against the 27 - year - old , who beat @entity23 @entity59 in another three - set match on friday			2

the @entity20 began in @entity74 on saturday , with @entity18 beating @entity75 3 - 0 in @entity76 and @entity77 defeating @entity78 2 - 1 in @entity79 @entity18 's win was helped by a knee injury suffered by @entity75 's former world no. 9 @entity82 , who has slipped out of the top 100 after suffering a series of physical problems in 2012			1
