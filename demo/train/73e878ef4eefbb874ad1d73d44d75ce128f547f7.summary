earlier this week , @entity0 marked 35 years of freedom from the @entity3 regime , whose revolutionary blueprint for an agrarian paradise caused the deaths of nearly two million in the 1970s			1
but instead of uniting @entity0 , the date perennially divides them			1
prime minister @entity11 's @entity10 casts the anniversary in the light of victory and liberation			1
opposition figures shrug off the festivities as propaganda , a reminder that after the @entity3 leaders retreated in 1979 , the @entity20 who defeated them stayed for 10 years			1
the diverging perspectives underscore what 's happening now			1
in the name of public order and security , the government commemorating the fall of a regime is leading one of the most aggressive campaigns against dissenting foes in recent memory , according to analysts			2
" @entity0 is now at a tipping point , " said @entity37 , a longtime observer of the country 's politics and a professor emeritus at the @entity41 in @entity42			1
in the past nine days , pro-government security forces have arrested human rights defenders , gunned down five striking garment workers and violently evicted protesters from a designated free speech zone called " @entity49			1
" at least 3 dead after security forces open fire last weekend , the @entity51 temporarily banned demonstrations and the courts have summoned opposition leaders @entity55 , president of the @entity57 , and his deputy , @entity59			1
" @entity0 authorities appear to have given up any semblance of democracy , rule of law or justice , " said @entity60 , head of the local advocacy group the @entity61 , in a statement earlier this week , after activists were briefly detained monday in an apparent enforcement of the ban on demonstrations			1
" the big questions are what is next and who will be next ? this madness must end now			2
" the @entity77 ' human rights arm has urged an investigation into the violence , and major clothing manufacturers that conduct business in @entity0 -- including @entity82 , the @entity83 and @entity84 , the parent company of @entity86 -- asked in a letter for a peaceful resolution			1
seeds of conflict seeds of turmoil were sown in july , when @entity11 's long - ruling @entity10 lost a chunk of parliamentary seats in the national elections , and @entity55 's @entity57 , or @entity57 , almost doubled its own			1
but @entity55 and his supporters claimed they were robbed of crucial votes that would have put them in front , ending nearly 30 years of @entity11 's rule			1
they demanded an international investigation into the election -- which did n't happen -- and for @entity11 to step down			1
thousands of people took to the streets in protest			2
while the opposition had floundered at times -- revising its demands to include a new election -- it appeared stronger than ever as 2013 came to a close			1
the largely peaceful journey of civil disobedience began to veer off course on december 24 , when unions , many of which line up politically with the opposition party , called for a nationwide garment worker strike , demanding an immediate monthly wage bump to $ 160 -- nearly double the $ 95 that the government first offered , and well above the $ 100 that was eventually proposed as a final offer			1
soon , new groups joined			1
tuk - tuk drivers demanded lower gasoline prices			2
buddhist monks called for the authorities to find a stolen golden urn believed to contain ashes of the @entity131			2
all of the anger pointed in one direction			2
crackdown country on the evening of january 2 , the crackdown began			2
in a protest outside a garment factory , authorities arrested 10 people , including garment workers and at least three human rights advocates , according to the @entity0 rights group @entity142			1
the arrested men face up to five years imprisonment			2
the next day , anger erupted outside the @entity146 in southwest @entity147			0
hundreds of garment workers threw rocks at security forces and created burning roadblocks			0
military police responded by firing automatic weapons			0
five workers were killed in the bloody clash , the @entity77 said this week			0
almost 40 were injured , and 13 people arrested , according to @entity142			0
on the hectic day of the confrontation , young men engaged in a standoff with a phalanx of riot police			0
one protester , @entity165 , 26 , who works at the park , was undeterred , cupping bullet casings in his hand as evidence			0
" very cruel , " he said			0
the sun rose on empty factories , smashed shops looted by demonstrators , mourning families and fearful residents			0
" i think @entity11 believes he 's losing control of the situation , " said @entity178 , executive director for @entity181 's @entity180 division			1
the prime minister has never really accepted the right to protest , he added			1
the government defended its actions , saying it had allowed the opposition to protest for months			1
but members of the public complained , said @entity191 , spokesman for the @entity192 , a collection of top cabinet posts			0
" the third party wants to use the street fairly			1
an ill person who wants medical attention gets blocked , " he said			0
" it 's too much			0
" the forceful response on january 2 had to occur because a national road was being occupied by demonstrators , he said			0
at @entity146 the following day , protesters had become aggressive , damaging factories and throwing rocks and using slingshots to project " iron balls " at authorities			0
" it 's not a protest anymore , it became a riot , " he said , adding that the government feels sorry for those killed			0
" we so regret that this happened , but they did n't obey peacefully , to cease all activity			0
rallying point targeted on the morning of january 4 , pro-government security guards and plainclothed thugs wearing red armbands stampeded through the opposition 's main protest camp , @entity49 , in the heart of the city , as tourists ate breakfast only blocks away			1
police at the scene did nothing to stop them			0
" the military force kicked the protesters , " said @entity233 , 31 , a microfinance worker who managed to escape			0
@entity236 issued a statement justifying the clearing of the park , saying it was an attempt to maintain order and security			0
the crowd " protested in an attempt to topple the government , and burned down garment factories , " said @entity243 , head of the department of central justice in @entity0 's @entity51			1
@entity191 justified the subsequent ban on demonstrations — which critics say is a crackdown on free speech and freedom of assembly — saying " there has to be a cool - down period			0
the divisions are so deep right now			0
" in tandem with the eviction , summonses were dispatched to @entity57 leaders @entity55 and @entity59 , asking them to appear in court on january 14 to explain the turmoil			0
@entity59 's political activities had landed him in jail before , and @entity55 's brushes with the government caused him to flee to @entity269 in 2009 , returning last year on the coattails of a royal pardon			0
by sunday , january 5 , security forces were stationed at various points in the capital			0
a common refrain in recent weeks has been that the rallies represented the most serious threat to @entity11 's government in years			1
but after heavy - handed pressure in the first week of january , garment strikers have largely returned to work and opposition leaders are regrouping			2
on thursday morning , when an opposition - affiliated youth group tried to sing a song inside the park , military police and security guards stopped them from getting into the main area , sending a clear message that the government will enforce its ban on demonstrations			2
the opposition 's staying power and resilience are finally being put to test			2
" we have to wait until the environment is a little bit calm , " said @entity297 , a @entity57 spokesman , this week			0
he added that protests in the city would resume , though he did n't say when .			2
