@entity1 they were n't exactly @entity3 but the three alleged @entity5 spies exposed by the @entity6 are part of the most intense effort by @entity5 to infiltrate agents onto @entity11 soil since the @entity12			1
in an affidavit unsealed in federal court on monday , the @entity13 accused @entity16 , also known as " @entity17 , " of posing as a @entity5 banker in @entity19 to funnel economic intelligence to the @entity21 , @entity5 's foreign intelligence agency			1
two other @entity5 , @entity22 and @entity23 , were ostensibly diplomats in @entity5 's @entity25 mission in @entity26 but are accused of being @entity16 's @entity21 handlers			1
while @entity16 was operating deep undercover and therefore had no diplomatic protection , the other two have immunity and have already left the the @entity11			1
anecdotes in the affidavit portray the accused spies as bumbling and hapless compared to the stereotype of hard - eyed @entity38 - era @entity37 professionals			1
still , news of their existences comes at the most perilous moment in @entity11 - @entity5 relations in decades , with @entity44 and @entity45 at a standoff over issues ranging from @entity48 to @entity50 's claims it has a right to a " sphere of influence " in its backyard			1
a spy operation will only serve to deepen the hostilities			2
professor @entity56 , a specialist in transnational organized crime , security affairs and @entity5 at @entity59 , said that @entity5 operations are cranking up against the @entity11 and its @entity62 allies			1
" it is clear that this is a process that has been taking place over time , " he said			0
" it is not just about throwing money and people into it			0
it is the tempo and the aggressiveness that is at the height of @entity12 levels			0
" @entity6 : @entity5 spies used tickets and hats to try to hide @entity26 activities @entity79 , author of " deception : the @entity81 of @entity82 , " said " @entity5 espionage in the @entity84 is on a bigger scale than it was during the @entity38 period			1
" " we are an open society so we are very easy to spy on and we are in competition with a very closed society , which is @entity5			2
they use intelligence as one of the most important tools in the @entity95 tool kit			0
" more than two decades after the presumptive end of the @entity12 , @entity5 spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy , " @entity11 attorney @entity97 said in a statement			1
assistant fbi director @entity104 warned that despite the collapse of the @entity107 , " espionage is as pervasive today as it has ever been			0
" " this case is especially egregious as it demonstrates the actions of a foreign intelligence service to integrate a covert intelligence agent into @entity11 society under the cover of an employee in the financial sector , " he said			2
the affidavit contains details of alleged -- and apparently fumbling -- attempts by the accused @entity21 agents to recruit female students at a @entity59 and a boastful @entity11 businessman dreaming of riches in the @entity5 energy industry			1
those tid bits have sparked derisive assessments of @entity50 's espionage prowess , echoing the ridicule drummed up by the outing of @entity129 in 2010			0
she was exposed in an @entity6 probe into 10 @entity5 deep cover " sleeper agents " and was later exchanged with @entity50 in a spy swap			2
according to the unclassified affidavit , the 2015 spies , like the 2010 brigade , appeared to extract little useful intelligence and appeared not to penetrate deeply into the @entity11 financial industry			1
in fact , the two alleged handlers , were caught on an @entity6 surveillance tape complaining that life as a spy in the @entity11 was n't like it was in the movies			1
@entity23 is quoted in the affidavit as saying that he did n't expect to be " @entity3 " but had expected a little more excitement			0
" of course , i would n't fly helicopters , " he said , but confessed he had expected to " pretend to be someone else " under an assumed identity			0
the pair apparently communicated with @entity16 using covert and coded methods and conducted 48 clandestine meetings , unaware they were under surveillance by the @entity6			0
@entity79 said that in retrospect their missions might look amateurish , but " all espionage operations look brilliant if they succeed and blundering if they fail			0
" close observers of the spy trade argue that media mockery over @entity129 , now a tv star and model in @entity5 , and her apparently unsuccessful comrades in @entity26 , detracts from a long - term , well - financed and painstaking effort by @entity50 -- and @entity45 , a former @entity37 agent -- to insert " illegals " deep into western society			1
@entity171 , a former @entity172 case officer who now heads the @entity173 in @entity1 , said that a perception had grown that those swept up in the 2010 operation were part of a hapless " @entity179 " operation			2
" the @entity5 under @entity45 have chosen to invest a lot of money into placing people like that overseas , " he said			2
" it was n't clear to the public what these people were doing			0
" " they were meant to be sleepers , " @entity171 said			0
" typically an illegal sent to another country is a sleeper			0
he or she is available to handle a very sensitive asset , or in the case of wartime , or some sort of confrontation , be available			0
" while the agents exposed in @entity26 this week were not " sleepers " , they were also evidence of a comprehensive @entity5 espionage program			2
the latest @entity202 by director of national intelligence @entity203 warned last year that @entity5 , in addition to challenging @entity11 cyber security , was also seeking to target @entity11 personnel with access to sensitive computer network information			1
he named @entity5 and @entity211 as the biggest threats to @entity11 state security and said they were seeking data on advanced weapons systems and information on @entity11 firms and research institutions that deal with energy , finance , the media , defense and dual use technologies			1
@entity225 , who spent a decade with the @entity226 working as an intelligence analyst and counterintelligence officer on @entity229 and the @entity230 , believes the @entity11 - @entity5 spy wars are as vibrant as ever			1
" this is the tip of an iceberg , " he said			0
" the 2010 illegals program that was rolled up by the @entity6 was a big success but this was not the end of it			0
" @entity225 said that since the demise of the @entity107 , @entity5 intelligence services have rebuilt overseas networks , partly to wage " economic war " against the @entity84			2
such an emphasis is increasingly important at a time when the @entity11 and its allies are imposing economic sanctions on powerful figures and top firms over @entity5 's annexation of @entity250 and alleged infiltration into eastern @entity48			1
the new @entity5 intelligence offensive has a world of opportunity			2
@entity5 businesses and capital are increasingly important to and invested in the global economy			2
and the nexus between vast @entity5 commercial and energy interests , and organized crime offers a shady world where spies can prosper			1
the affidavit in the @entity16 case alleges that the @entity21 sought to use an official @entity5 news organization in the @entity11 to get information about high - frequency automated trading systems used on @entity269 and to gauge interest among brokers about @entity5 products			1
while it lays out a comprehensive legal case against the three alleged @entity5 spies , the document also includes several intriguing story lines and leaves key questions unanswered in the fog of the espionage wars			1
the document includes transcripts of conversations between @entity283 , @entity22 and @entity16 -- not just from phone taps , but from what it says are discussions " inside the @entity289 office			0
" that leaves open the possibility that the @entity6 managed to get some kind of bug into the super secure premises			0
@entity79 said its mention may be intended to induce paranoia among @entity5 intelligence chiefs who may wonder what other sensitive conversations were swept up			2
the document also says that in the summer of 2014 , @entity16 " met numerous times with a confidential source working for the @entity6			0
" that revelation may also lead @entity21 bosses to question the extent of @entity6 knowledge about their operations			0
another question is why did the @entity6 move now ? " arresting a foreign spy is the last option , you would rather turn them or watch who they are taking to , " said @entity56			0
" why did they decide to arrest this guy ? did they think they would be about to return to @entity5 ? was it because there was a risk that he was going to stumble across something important ? " was it time to put a shot across the @entity5 bows ? " the idea that the @entity11 wanted to make a political point about its intelligence operations at a time of rising tensions appears supported by the robust language of the @entity13 press release			1
" we will use every tool at our disposal to identify and hold accountable foreign agents operating inside this country -- no matter how deep their cover , " said attorney general @entity333			0
@entity97 added : " @entity26 may be more hospitable to @entity5 businessmen than during the @entity12 , but my office and the @entity6 remain vigilant to the illegal intelligence - gathering activities of other nations			1

alleged @entity5 spies seem hapless but may hint at wider operation
arrest comes at time of sharp @entity11 - @entity5 tensions
