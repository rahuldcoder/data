-- remember payphones ? this might sound crazy , but if @entity4 has its way , people might actually start using them again to communicate with each other			2
the city announced thursday that it has created @entity10 hotspots at 10 payphone kiosks in three of the city 's boroughs			1
it 's the first step in a pilot program designed to make wireless access available to as many people as possible in the city			0
the kiosks ( seven in @entity20 , two in @entity21 and one in @entity23 ) have antennas that create @entity10 hotspots providing free wireless service up to 300 feet away			1
more will be added in the coming months , according to the blog post announcing the program			1

" i think it 's a good start for reusing payphones , which serve less and less need in our mobile - centric world , " @entity49 wrote for tech blog @entity50			0
" and it speaks to our addiction to @entity10 and data , which is now even more popular than cellular			0

" i ca n't recall the last time i 've used a payphone but i 'll be glad to see them around if it means more free @entity10 , " he wrote			1
