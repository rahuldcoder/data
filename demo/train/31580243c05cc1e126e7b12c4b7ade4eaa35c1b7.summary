-- prosecutors will appeal a 30 - day jail sentence handed down monday against @entity3 , the @entity5 student convicted of spying on and intimidating his gay roommate , who then killed himself by jumping off @entity8 's @entity7			1
@entity10 prosecutor @entity9 said @entity12 's crimes warranted " more than a 30 - day jail term " and called superior judge @entity14 's sentence " insufficient under the sentencing laws of this state , the facts that were determined by a jury and long - standing appellate precedent			1
" calling the appeal " a registering of outrage , " @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity21 said there is " very little chance " the sentence will be overturned			1
he noted that under @entity30 law , the judge had the flexibility to sentence @entity12 to anything from zero to 10 years in prison			1
" the heart of this case was a paradox : was this a prank that just got out of control after the fact , or was it a hate crime ? " @entity21 said			1
" he was convicted of a hate crime , but the judge really treated this like a prank			1
" is 30 - day sentence fair for student who bullied gay roommate ? under the sentence , @entity12 will serve three years of probation and must complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes , according to @entity54			1
he also must pay more than $ 11,000 in restitution			0
@entity54 stayed the jail sentence for 10 days pending expected appeals from the prosecution and the defense			0
the september 2010 death of @entity61 , and @entity12 's trial this year , thrust the issue of cyberbullying and prejudices against homosexuals into the national spotlight			1
@entity68 , an 18 - year - old freshman , plunged to his death into the @entity70 after learning @entity12 had secretly spied via a webcam as @entity68 kissed another man			1
opinion : what the tragedy of @entity61 teaches about teen sexting			2
" i have n't heard you apologize once , " @entity54 told @entity12 , 20			2
he said @entity68 " placed his trust in you without any conditions , and you violated it			0
" @entity12 , he said , acted out of " colossal insensitivity			2
" @entity54 said he took @entity12 's youth and his lack of a criminal record into consideration in determining the sentence			1
the judge told @entity12 the only reason he did not recommend deportation was because the man involved in the videotaped encounter , identified in court only as " @entity93 , " said in his victim impact statement he did not believe @entity12 should be deported and would be willing to write a letter to that effect			1
@entity12 could have faced 10 years in prison and deportation to his native @entity99 @entity12 's sentencing hearing stretched to nearly four hours monday , punctuated by emotional victim impact statements by @entity68 's parents and brother			1
" my son @entity105 was a kind and gentle soul , " @entity68 said of his son			0
" nobody other than @entity105 understood how vulnerable he was , but the fact is that he was very vulnerable -- and he was shaken by the cold , criminal actions of his roommate			0
" @entity111 recalled his brother 's excitement about attending college			0
" he could never have known the viper 's nest he was walking into , " he said			0
" i have often found myself wondering if @entity3 is even capable of empathizing with another person , " the brother added			2
in his statement , " @entity93 " said , " i do not mind that mr. @entity12 has never apologized to me for what he did and said , but i do wonder if it ever has entered his mind that he has caused me a great deal of pain and yet he knows nothing about me			2
" @entity12 's parents also addressed the court , although he chose not to speak			1
" not a single day goes by we do n't think about @entity105 , " said his father , @entity132			0
but he said his son had been demonized and " dragged through the mud			0
" " how can a person who never acted as a bully ... go from a passive child to hardcore bully overnight ? " he asked			0
his mother , @entity138 , cried as she related the stress and pain her son has experienced since @entity68 's death			0
" he has been living in hell for the past 20 months , " she said			0
listening to her statement , @entity12 grew tearful for the first time during the hearing			2
after his mother finished speaking , the two embraced as she sobbed			0
@entity149 , a gay rights advocate and television producer who has hosted shows on @entity152 and @entity154 radio , told @entity156 's @entity155 he was " physically disgusted " by the 30 - day sentence			2
" gay kids across the country need to get the message that their life matters , " which the @entity30 native claimed is the opposite of what came across monday			0
" that is the message that is being sent : that we still do not take these things seriously , " said @entity149 , lamenting that " @entity61 had no chance , " though @entity12 would get one			1
though @entity12 and @entity61 -- a fellow student who admitted to joining @entity12 to watch the surreptitious encounter that others were alerted to via social media -- were charged in the wake of @entity68 's suicide , they were not charged directly with his death			1
facing two counts of invasion of privacy , @entity178 reached a plea deal that required her to testify against her friend and former high school classmate as well as to complete a three - year program on cyberbullying and 300 hours of community service			2
before sentencing @entity12 , @entity54 said he was planning to terminate @entity178 's program early , noting that she testified candidly against @entity12 although " it was clear she did n't want to be here			1
" he said she had completed 250 hours of community service before her testimony			0
@entity12 , who was studying on a visa at the @entity30 university at the time of the incident , turned down a plea deal offered by @entity10 prosecutors			2
under the terms of that offer , he would have avoided jail time in exchange for undergoing counseling , doing 600 hours of community service and disposing of any information that could identify the man who appeared in the web video with @entity68			0
prosecutors also offered to help @entity12 avoid deportation , though they said they could not guarantee it			2
that set the stage for the trial , during which prosecutors argued that @entity12 tried to embarrass @entity68 because he was gay and that his actions were motivated by a desire to intimidate the @entity215 , @entity30 , native expressly because of his sexual orientation			0
" these acts were purposeful , they were intentional , and they were planned , " prosecutor @entity218 told the jury on the first day of the trial			0
@entity12 " was bothered by @entity61 's sexual orientation , " she later said more bluntly			1
@entity12 's attorneys countered by portraying their client as an immature college student who made a mistake and insisting his actions were not based on homophobia			1
after more than three weeks in court , a jury on march 16 convicted @entity12 of invasion of privacy , bias intimidation , witness tampering , hindering apprehension and tampering with physical evidence			1
opinion : bullying case calls for smarter sentence than 10 years in prison days after his conviction , @entity12 told @entity242 television 's " @entity240 " that he thought @entity68 understood he " was n't trying to intimidate him and scare him because he was gay			1
" he also criticized the public portray of what happened			0
" i felt like i was being used by everybody , " said @entity12			0
" they were taking revenge on me , even though what they think happened is n't what happened			0

new : there 's " very little chance " the sentence will be overturned , @entity0 's @entity21 says
the judge says he took @entity3 's age and other factors into consideration
@entity12 was convicted of invasion of privacy , bias intimidation and other charges
@entity61 , 18 , then killed himself , setting off a national *discussion* about bullying
