@entity0 -- @entity2 are spending the final weekend of campaigning before tuesday 's election sizing up the possibility of their first @entity7 majority in nearly a decade , but with key races still too close to call			1
latest polls show some critical @entity7 races tightening , guaranteeing a night of drama and suspense on tuesday , as @entity2 strive for a net gain of six seats to capture the chamber			1
a @entity2 victory would give the party complete control on @entity19 and the ability to constrain president @entity21 's final two years in office			1
but the best the @entity2 can hope for is a slim majority , which would do little to end the era of gridlock and partisan division that has stifled @entity0 for years and contributed to an ugly public mood ahead of the election			1
even if they win on tuesday , there is no scenario in which @entity2 will gain enough senators to build a 60 seat super-majority that is needed to move major legislation in a deeply partisan @entity35			2
some races are so tight that turnout will be crucial			2
in @entity40 , a @entity1 / @entity39 poll had @entity2 @entity41 up by two points as she tries to grab a @entity7 seat held by the retiring @entity44 for nearly 30 years			1
in @entity47 , @entity46 sen. @entity45 is clinging to a two - point margin in a state that leans @entity2 in another @entity1 survey			2
in @entity53 , sen. @entity51 , the man in line to cap a long career on @entity19 by becoming @entity7 majority leader if @entity2 win on tuesday , appears to have opened a small gap over his @entity46 challenger @entity57			1
the @entity2 has a solid grip on the @entity59 and republicans are expected to easily win @entity7 races in @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
other battlegrounds are in @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			0
top party surrogates and potential 2016 presidential candidates were fanning out in battleground states with three days to go			0
@entity75 appeared with @entity57 in @entity53 , and pleaded with voters not to heed " fear " tactics from republicans she called the " guardians of gridlock			0
" " do n't wake up the day after the election wishing you had done just a little more , " @entity82 told @entity57 supporters			0
on sunday , @entity82 will take her turnout machine to @entity69 to support sen. @entity87 who is in a surprisingly close tussle with challenger @entity89			0
her husband , @entity82 meanwhile tried to give @entity92 @entity91 a boost in @entity40 on saturday			0
@entity95 governor @entity94 was headlining a rally in @entity97 for @entity98 governor @entity98 , who is seeking re-election			0
@entity21 , who has been a drag on @entity46 candidates , was nevertheless headed to @entity102 on saturday to campaign for @entity7 candidate @entity103 and representative @entity104			0
@entity70 will meanwhile on sunday hold the final debate before election day of a compelling race between @entity108 and @entity2 @entity109 , in which @entity46 are hopeful of pulling off a shock win			2
two @entity7 races , in @entity68 and @entity70 could trigger run - off elections , so it is possible the fate of the chamber will be in limbo for weeks .			1
