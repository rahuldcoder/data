-- @entity2 's response to a massive earthquake and a tsunami scare wednesday highlights a critical reality : warning systems and emergency responses have come a long way since the catastrophe of eight years ago			1
but there 's still work to be done -- not just in @entity2 , but in some other countries throughout the region as well			1
fears that wednesday 's 8.6 - magnitude quake and resulting tsunami alert could bring a repeat of the 2004 disaster dissipated quickly as seismologists determined that wednesday 's events were very different and much less dangerous			1
in the intervening hours , @entity2 put in place many of the procedures it has worked on for years , including some practiced at a drill witnessed by @entity0 in 2009			1
" the lesson of 2004 is something that we 're not going to repeat at this stage , " vowed @entity26 , a spokesman for the @entity2 president 's office			1
speaking to @entity0 while evacuations were under way in parts of his country , he said the government was working " to bring confidence among the people that the government is with them			1
" residents were being evacuated from some areas and encouraged to head to higher ground quickly , and authorities were trying to get information from remote areas , he said			2
later , the @entity48 lifted a tsunami watch for the entire @entity50 , indicating the threat had passed			2
" the tsunami warning system worked well , " said @entity52 , spokesman for the @entity53			1
" people reacted quickly and evacuated to higher ground			2
mosques , churches helped spread the information to the public			0
there was panic but that 's expected			0
" no serious casualties or major damage was reported wednesday from the quake and the 8.2 - magnitude aftershock off the coast of @entity69			0
four people were slightly injured on @entity72 , off the coast of @entity74 , the disaster management agency spokesman said			0
in 2004 , a 9.1 - magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that ultimately killed nearly 230,000 people in the region			1
" in 2004 , the quake was closer to the coast , stronger and was a different kind of earthquake , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity79 said			1
" in 2004 , the sea floor moved vertically , and this thrust displaced a lot of water , which produced the large tsunami			1
in this case , the plates moved more horizontally , and therefore a large tsunami was not generated			0
" " even though the epicenters were only about 200 miles ( about 320 kilometers ) apart , they occurred on different tectonic plates , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity92 added			1
" there are several plates that come together in this area , which is why it is so tectonically active			0
today 's quake occurred on the @entity50 plate , while the 2004 quake occurred on the @entity104 plate			1
" a 9.1 - magnitude quake is 3.2 times larger , and more than 5 times stronger , than an 8.6 - magnitude quake , @entity0 meteorologist @entity105 said			1
tsunami warning sirens blared wednesday in parts of @entity2 , and the other steps taken show that " governments are more prepared , " said @entity0 weather anchor @entity112			1
" there are sirens in place along coastal communities			0
there are buoys in the ocean to measure water level changes			0
there is better communication among government agencies , countries and the media			0
the word gets out much more quickly , and that helps saves lives , " @entity126 said			0
however , " the number of measuring devices in the @entity50 is tiny compared to the @entity132			0
it 's a start , but more are needed			0
" in october 2009 , @entity0 's @entity134 visited the devastated @entity74 region			1
he watched a well - organized tsunami drill , complete with droning alarms and people covered in fake blood fleeing from an imaginary wave			2
authorities have built tsunami shelters that are raised high and can hold several hundred people , he said			2
while it was not immediately clear how many people headed to higher ground wednesday , some videos from the region showed people apparently leaving low - lying areas			1
that speaks to another important change from 2004 : people are more aware of the danger			2
back then , " there was nothing , " @entity134 said			0
" no one really knew what to do , no one even knew what a tsunami was			0
" now , @entity126 adds , " overall , the general population is much more aware			0
" the need for that awareness applies to citizens of other countries as well , said @entity168 , a spokesman for the @entity169 in @entity170			0
" sadly , we did learn a lot of lessons from that ( 2004 ) natural disaster , " he said wednesday			2
" and one of the biggest ones is that people should really keep in touch with their embassy			0
" other countries in the region also reacted quickly to wednesday 's tsunami threat			1
@entity170 issued an evacuation order for everyone along the @entity186 coast wednesday , according to state - run news agency @entity187			0
in the @entity189 , some resorts were evacuated as a precaution , according to @entity0 's @entity191 , who was on vacation in the islands			1
but , she said , " what strikes me most is essentially the lack of a warning system " in the @entity189			1
officials rely primarily on information from the @entity201 , she said			0
that speaks to the problem the region still faces , @entity126 said			0
" the fact that the @entity189 were included in the ( warning center ) bulletin is an improvement from 2004			2
but there 's still a long way to go			2

new : the warning system worked well , @entity2 says
nearly 230,000 people died in the 2004 tsunami
wednesday 's quakes were different , @entity0 meteorologists say
while warnings and responses have improved , there 's still a long way to go in some areas
