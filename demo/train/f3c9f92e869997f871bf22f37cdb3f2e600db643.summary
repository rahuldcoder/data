i do n't know if i would qualify			0
my golf game is not that good			0
certainly if i were a member , if i could run @entity5 , which is n't likely to happen , of course i 'd have women into @entity5			2
" @entity44 , in a statement e-mailed to reporters , said , " i encourage @entity5 to accept women members , but i recognize their right as a private organization to decide for themselves			1
" @entity50 said his wife , @entity51 , a golfer herself , would be a " great member			0
" during his annual media session wednesday , @entity53 , chairman of the @entity5 , did not comment specifically on @entity13			1

" that statement remains accurate ; it remains my statement			0
" @entity12 spokesman @entity63 told @entity0 on wednesday that the company would not comment on the controversy			1
most @entity5 patrons seem untroubled by the policy the question of @entity13 's membership has again brought the gender controversy to the forefront			1
women 's rights activist @entity73 tried to change the exclusionary policy nine years ago when she showed up at the @entity5 entrance to lead a series of protests against men - only membership			1
her efforts were in vain			0
now , she says , " the boys " at @entity5 , members and sponsors alike , find themselves in a big bind			2
" the ' woman problem ' is back , " she wrote in a column for @entity0 on tuesday			0
@entity73 says there are only two choices at hand : @entity5 can open its doors to women , or @entity12 can yank its money and force its male executives to resign from the club			1
" those are the only two options that are viable that are going to wash with the public , " @entity73 told @entity0 last week			0
@entity5 's membership -- which includes titans of industry and finance -- has been male - only since the club 's opening in 1932			1
when @entity73 tried to change things in 2002 , @entity5 's then - chairman , @entity107 , resisted , saying that gender integration would not come " at the point of a bayonet			1

nonmembers can play on the course only when hosted by members			0
@entity5 is famously secretive about its membership , and the club declined to comment on the issue , as did @entity12 spokesman @entity124			1

@entity12 , however , has played a role in changing policy before			2

on the eve of the 2012 masters opening thursday , speculation surfaced that @entity53 , known to be more progressive than his predecessor , would offer @entity13 a membership , but only after the tournament ends and the gender debate dies down			1
" sorry , but that dog wo n't hunt , " @entity73 wrote			0
" telling @entity13 to be a good girl and wait a little longer with @entity12 's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company 's image , but for @entity13 's credibility as its leader			1
" more and more people are asking @entity5 to man up and get rid of what they say is a discriminatory policy from the past			2
@entity53 did not announce any sweeping changes from the hot seat wednesday			0
that means that @entity13 will probably not show up this year in a green jacket			2
the question is : will she ever ?			0
