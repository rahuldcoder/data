@entity0 -- the @entity2 pushed its first tv spot in a $ 1 million ad campaign in @entity5 to attack the @entity8 nominee 's top two opponents in what has become a competitive three - way race for the seat			1
the 30 - second spot , which hit @entity5 airwaves tuesday , links @entity15 opponent @entity14 and @entity8 - turned - independent former sen. @entity16 as holding the same positions on gun laws , energy and @entity20 and comes less than a week after @entity15 announced their own $ 1 million campaign to attack @entity8 nominee former gov. @entity23			1
republicans also deployed two political operatives to @entity5 to boost @entity23 ' campaign operation			0
the ad features two balloons with @entity23 ' opponents names , pointing out that " @entity14 and @entity16 have a lot in common			0
" by the end of the ad , both balloons have deflated because " when it comes to looking out for @entity5 , they both fall flat			0
" " @entity14 supports @entity20 , just like @entity16 , " the ad claims , adding that @entity23 ' @entity15 and @entity37 opponents also favor " stricter gun laws " and " want you to pay more for your energy			1
" for now , @entity23 still leads the four - man pack , which also includes @entity42 , a social conservative running to @entity23 ' right who barely registers in the polls			0
country - singing @entity49 hopeful ' rocks ' @entity5 race a @entity51 poll released last week showed the race is a three - way split with @entity16 trailing the @entity8 nominee by just three points , with @entity14 another four points behind the independent			2
until @entity16 gained traction , @entity23 was considered a shoe - in for the @entity49 seat in what is traditionally a red state			0
by taking on both candidates , the @entity62 campaign arm is gearing up to deflect @entity15 ads against @entity23 , which could be a boon for either @entity16 or @entity23			1
the @entity67 's investment in attack ads , rather than @entity70 ad buys , suggests @entity15 are confident a win from either candidate will be a gain toward maintaining a blue @entity49			1
@entity16 has n't said who he would caucus with if elected back into the @entity49 -- after a nearly 20 - year hiatus -- but has been open and unabashed about his support for president @entity77 , first endorsing @entity77 in his 2008 run			0
it would n't be the first time this year @entity15 have pinned their hopes on an independent candidate polling better than his @entity15 counterpart after the @entity15 nominee dropped out in the @entity49 race in hopes of bolstering businessman @entity89 's campaign to unseat @entity90 sen. @entity90			2
but some also suggest that the @entity67 , which has a bigger war chest than their @entity8 counterparts , could be trying to thin the @entity2 's resources in a state where they likely would not have otherwise pumped cash .			2

the @entity8 *launched* its first of $ 1 million in tv ad days after @entity15 announced a similar buy .
the spot ties the leading independent and @entity15 candidates to each other .
the @entity67 's $ 1 million investment will go to attacking @entity8 hopeful @entity23 .
