-- when @entity4 's husband left on his second deployment to @entity6 in 2005 , their 2 - year - old daughter began banging her head on the floor			1
the @entity10 wife tried to rock the girl , sing to her			1
with a newborn to care for , too , sometimes all @entity4 could do was quickly slide her hand between the toddler 's head and the floor			1
exhausted and desperate , @entity4 rushed to the store , wailing children in tow			1
she found a @entity21 doll with black hair like her husband 's and placed it in her daughter 's hands			1
" daddy , " the girl said			1
she stopped crying and stopped hurting herself			1
looking back , the 36 - year - old mother remembers how some people , including other military spouses , dismissed her daughter 's behavior as typical tantrums			1
" but i knew something was wrong with her , " @entity4 said			1
" i knew this child felt deeply the loss of her dad			1
" for years , military parents facing a deployment have said the same refrain : " my child is so young , they wo n't remember			1
" but very young children -- even babies -- can suffer psychological stress , developmental problems and cognitive damage when a parent goes to war , according to recent research by the @entity50			1
for military youths in general , researchers have also found they are more likely than their civilian peers to have trouble in school and experience higher levels of anxiety and depression			2
" what we 're seeing over the last decade is an increase in kids being seen for behavioral health visits			2
we know there has been an increase , " said @entity63 , a child psychologist			1
in 2005 , she founded give an hour , a national nonprofit network of nearly 7,000 mental health providers who volunteer their services to warriors and their families			2
" this is not shocking to those of us who work in this space , " she said			2
" this is what you expect when you 've got stress beyond what kids can successfully manage			2
" a generation raised by war the @entity4 children are among the more than 2 million who have been separated from their service member parents , both fathers and mothers , because of combat deployments , according to " @entity90 , " an academic series co-authored by psychiatrist and retired @entity10 col. @entity93 , a researcher with the @entity94			1
@entity96 is raising a uniquely stressed - out generation of military children , other researchers say			1
those who were 5 when the september 11 terror attacks happened are now 17 ; war is all they 've known			1
while military children have always faced challenges and demonstrated resiliency , these children have parents who 've been deployed multiple times			1
military spouses told me story after story about not just one or two birthdays missed , but about struggling to comfort children whose entire lives were lived essentially without one parent			1
how @entity6 and @entity118 service members and their partners parent is being studied by @entity120 , a clinical social worker at @entity50			1
she 's found that male service members tend to minimize their importance to their young children , and their female partners feel left out			1
the children tend to mirror the way their parents handle deployments			1
" my husband has probably been gone for 80 % of their lives , " @entity4 said of their children when i visited the family in november at their home in @entity132			1
their daughter , now 10 , and son , 8 , laughed and played while clutching that same @entity21 doll and a pillow with a picture of their dad , @entity10 capt. @entity141			2
the family stood out from other military families i met because they had , early on , connected with military - referred therapists			2
the children regularly saw their " feelings doctor , " as did their mother and father			1
a spouse teetering on the edge @entity141 , a decorated service member who 's done three deployments , was home when i visited but had to leave after our interview			2
he was n't going to war this time , but to @entity156 to take an eight - month career advancement course			1
that meant that he 'd only get to come home once a month at most			2
it was difficult explaining to his children that @entity161 was going to a classroom like they did and would n't be in danger			1
he encouraged the kids to ask questions			2
they wanted to know if he was going to wear a helmet when he did homework			2
this is how the @entity4 household works -- every time the 36 - year - old soldier leaves , the couple tries to keep communication strong and constant			2
he sends them letters with drawings			2
they color them in and mail them back			2
they send him the beginning of a story , and he fills in a part ; they continue the plot			2
the family gave up skyping when he was in @entity6 in 2009			1
" it was almost cruel to them to be like , ' look , there 's @entity161 , you can see him , but you ca n't touch him or smell him , ' " @entity141 told me			2
@entity4 served in the @entity192 from 1996 to 2000			2
he was in college , and @entity4 had just finished graduate school when the 9/11 terror attacks happened			2
he was gripped him with an overwhelming urge to serve again			2
after discussing it with @entity4 , he joined			0
the two married in june 2002			0
he left for @entity118 in 2004 on a four - month deployment			1
his daughter was then 6 weeks old			0
" she wo n't remember anything , i thought ; so what , @entity4 will be there to handle things , " he recalled			0
" i did n't feel like it was long enough for anybody to feel anything			0
" but @entity4 was n't handling it well			0
she was suffering from what she now recognizes was post-partum depression			0
but she was afraid to say anything			0
she recalled the mantra she repeated in her head			1
i have to do this perfectly			0
i need to be good at this , because if i 'm not good at this , i 'm failing him			0
in the brief time that her husband came home -- before he deployed to @entity6 in 2005 -- @entity4 got pregnant again			1
while he was gone , her daughter 's crying and banging of her head and the demands of a newborn consumed @entity4			1
an aspiring writer , she started to tell her story on a blog and on paper , an outpouring that turned into a memoir , " the day after he left for @entity6			1
" for a while , the writing worked to calm her			0
he came home and life went on			0
but when he was ordered to deploy a third time in 2009 , she had a panic attack			0
because she 'd never treated her depression , she was terrified of how she would react to being a single parent again			1
she called @entity246 , the armed services 24/7 nonemergency hotline			0
she connected with a thoughtful operator who reminded her that she 'd been through a lot , and to breathe			0
recalling that time , @entity4 wept thinking about what might have happened had she not made the call			0
" thankfully i did n't hurt her ... " she said about her daughter			0
" and i did n't hurt myself			0
" a father at home , but not really there @entity141 reflects on his choices , too			1
he is constantly torn between his love for his family and his love of the @entity10			0
with each deployment , his children acted differently toward him			1
when he asked where his son 's @entity264 was , the boy gave him a look and walked past him to play with toys @entity269 had never seen			0
during his third deployment , his daughter started drawing pictures of crying animals			1
" after i came back from my second deployment , my daughter , she was very emotional , " he said			0
" i did n't understand what any of that was about			0
@entity141 's last deployment ended in 2010 , and he came home			0
and yet , he 's not really been home , @entity4 said			0
for the past three years , @entity141 has been a commander of a drill sergeant rotation at @entity281 in @entity132			0
he would leave for work at 3 in the morning and , most of the time , if he was at home when they were , he was in bed			0
as a consequence , the children were never really sure if he was home or gone			1
" there 's a misconception that when you come home from deployment , you 're home , " @entity4 said			0
that might be true for some people , but not the job her husband had			0
that explains why , as @entity269 told me , when he is home and goes outside , to take the trash out or something , the children will panic if they call for him and he does n't answer immediately			1
" they 'll say ' @entity301 , @entity301 ! ' " he said			0
" they get terrified that we 're leaving them			0
" all he can do is try to reassure them , not just with words but actions			0
some service members fear that seeking mental health care will adversely affect their careers			0
but @entity4 said he 's been unafraid to talk openly with @entity10 counselors			0
he did n't do it sooner , he said , not because he had concerns about his career but because of the pace of the wars			1
he did n't have time to stop and breathe , to figure out he needed to talk to someone			0
" it was just , like , i got ta do this , that , go here , come back , do this , come here , go back , " he said			0
" once i was not feeling anticipation for a deployment , then i was not afraid			0
" his daughter runs up to him a few times as we talk , and smiles and presses into him			0
she lingers and watches him as we film , her @entity21 tight in her hand .			0

more than 2 million children have been separated from a parent in the @entity6 , @entity118 wars
even babies can suffer cognitive and developmental problems when a parent goes to war
counseling is *key* says mom whose child started banging her head when father left for @entity6
