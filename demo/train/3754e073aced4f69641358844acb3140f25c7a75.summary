-- political consensus was hard to find at last month 's @entity2 but there was at least one group speaking with unity on the planet 's environmental and economic future			1
hundreds of activists gathered on the city 's @entity10 to make a simple demand of their elected leaders and representatives : commit to ending fossil fuel subsidies , now			1
more than a million people around the world -- including actor @entity19 and comedian @entity20 - were quick to lend their support by backing # endfossilfuelsubsidies , an affiliated online campaign			2
but as the summit came to a close it became clear that no new enforceable commitments on the issue were to be included in the final version of the @entity2 agreement text			2
for those behind the protest however , the widespread exposure and support afforded the oft ignored subject ensured their efforts still represented a success			0
see also : was @entity2 a failure of political leadership ? " this all falls into changing our energy usage patterns , which i believe is the pre-eminent challenge of the 21st century , " says @entity41 , founder of @entity42 , an environmental advocacy group that backs the # endfossilfuelsubsidies campaign			1
" the first place to start is to stop putting public money towards fossil fuels , " he adds			1
" this is not because anybody has it in for the fossil fuel industry			1
what we 're talking about is what the public 's money actually should support			2
" estimates as to how much this support equates to vary from study to study , as do methods and standards for calculation			0
the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) reported that internationally $ 409 billion worth of government money flowed into the coffers of the fossil fuel industry in consumption subsidies ( designed to make fuel more affordable and accessible to the consumer ) in 2010			1
a separate study from the @entity75 @entity74 estimates that global fossil fuel subsidies will reach $ 775 billion this year when producer subsidies ( designed to facilitate greater fuel production ) are added on			1
however @entity41 believes these figures may only be the tip of the iceberg and could actually top $ 1 trillion every year			1
he says there is often a lack of transparency in how some governments report the incentives , with many transferred as hard - to - calculate tax credits			0
@entity41 similarly laments the comparatively sparse investment in renewable energy subsidies ( which stood at $ 66 billion in 2010 according to the @entity66 ) as a wasted opportunity to create less polluting energy sources whilst encouraging growth in the green economy			2
" at the end of the day , not only is this bad policy but its also bad economics , " he says			2
" long term , renewables are a better option for the environment and the economy			0
there are multiple studies that show how much more labor intensive renewables are and how they create more jobs per unit of energy created			0
" see also : who 's funding green energy however others are more cautious about the consequences that an about - turn in energy policy could create			0
" in certain countries and situations , subsidies are essential to peoples way of life , " says @entity116 the deputy vice-president of policy at the @entity118 , a @entity119 based organization that advocates free market energy policies			0
any alteration to this arrangement could cause prices to balloon , weakening development and in the worst case scenario leading to social unrest , he adds			0
@entity116 points out that a large proportion of subsidies are in fact designed to keep fuel prices artificially low , enabling consumers in some of the world 's poorest regions access to basic energy products			1
" at the @entity141 they are calling for the end of fossil fuels subsidies but what they are really talking about is the developing world , " he says			1
" if you want a pejorative to describe the situation ... what we 've got is a bunch of rich countries whose people have used energy to become rich assigning blame for subsidies on those countries that are poorer			2
" see also : the problem with fossil fuel subsidies @entity116 also believes that renewables still ca n't compete with traditional energy sources in terms of their cost effectiveness , accessibility and energy output			1
" the only fair way to look at subsidies is to analyze the subsidy per unit of energy produced			0
on that score the numbers are incredibly slanted against renewables , " he says			0
" just because you can make energy from something does n't mean that it makes sense competitively or economically			0
" effective and efficient energy policy in the long term , @entity116 explains , would see individual countries pursue the sources of energy that are most accessible and affordable to them , be they renewable or fossil fuel			1
" the best energy policy is that which makes energy as cheap , reliable and abundant as possible for the most people so that economies can grow , " he says .			0

subsidies for the fossil fuel *sector* total $ 1 trillion annually , according to @entity42
@entity42 says public money should not be going to industries that contribute to *climate* change
others believe cutting fossil fuel subsidies could hit the people in the developing world hardest
