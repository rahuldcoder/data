-- for a man dubbed " @entity2 , " @entity2 is n't putting his feet up anytime soon			1
one of the most successful golfers in the world , the 42 - year - old boasts an incredible three major championship crowns and nearly 70 wins in a stellar career spanning 22 years			1
but far from basking in his golfing glory , the @entity9 is throwing his weight -- and his millions -- behind an important cause close to his heart			2
the former world no. 1 's son @entity16 was diagnosed with autism five years ago , and @entity2 plans to open a world - leading research and education center -- " something the world 's never seen before			1
" " we have one child in our family with autism			0
i 've seen families with three kids with autism and i want to tell you it must be one of the hardest things in the world because just to do your normal , everyday life stuff must be almost impossible , " he told @entity0			2
" he 's nine years old and he 's not speaking yet			0
he goes to a very good school in @entity39			2
that 's another thing that 's lacking around the world , is education for autistic children			0
that 's why we moved from @entity46 to go to @entity39 for proper treatment for him			2
" until recently , @entity2 had remained private about his family life			0
now he 's using his status -- winning the @entity53 in 1994 and 1997 and the @entity54 in 2002 -- to help fund the @entity2 for @entity55 in @entity39			1
since 2009 , he has been hosting golf tournaments to raise money for his dream center			0
it will be based in the @entity60 but it is hoped its programs and research will help autistic children around the world			0
@entity2 has so far raised around $ 25 million towards the project , but is still $ 5 million short of his target for construction			1
and the man who topped the @entity71 's money list in 1993 and 1994 , and is nicknamed for his six - foot - three - inch frame and seemingly effortless golf swing , has n't limited his enterprises to autism research			0
giving it back : @entity2 ' off - course passions @entity2 ' golf foundation , now in its 13th year , was established to help under - privileged kids take up a sport unaffordable to most in his native @entity9			1
he also contributes to the economy of the @entity84 where he grew up , investing in a wine and restaurant business plus an award - winning golf resort that he helped design			0
so while @entity2 has spent most of his life carving a name for himself as one of the best golfers in the world , he says he now wants to be remembered for dedicating the rest of it to autism research .			1

former world no. 1 @entity2 is throwing his support behind *ambitious* autism center
the @entity9 golfer hopes the foundation in @entity39 will be the best in the world
he is *inspired* by his son @entity16 , who was diagnosed with autism as a four - year - old
two - time @entity53 winner still needs to raise $ 5 million to reach his $ *30* million target
