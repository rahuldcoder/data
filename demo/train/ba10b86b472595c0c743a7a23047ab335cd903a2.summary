-- it 's not only global tycoons and car manufacturers that are greasing the wheels of @entity6 -- countries are doing it too			1
traditionally governments have invested in @entity6 by stumping up cash to stage races but now they are cutting deals with drivers and teams			2
the @entity16 state oil company @entity15 funds pastor @entity18 's drive for @entity19			1
this summer @entity20 announced a partnership deal involving three backers with close links to the @entity25 state that will see the @entity28 team fast track teenager @entity27 into a race seat in time for the inaugural @entity25 @entity30 in 2014			2
" it 's a huge responsibility that i have , " @entity18 , who had the personal approval of late @entity16 president @entity32 , told @entity0			1
" i have a complete country pushing in my back so every day we do not do very well , i have some pressure			0
" but why do countries want to invest in the fickle world of @entity6 in the first place , where there is no tangible return on their investment ? @entity46 team principal @entity45 explained to @entity0 : " last year @entity6 was watched by over half a billion people			2
" there are only two world sports -- football and @entity6			2
it 's natural that as @entity6 expands the calendar and goes into new markets [ people ] want to be involved and invest in the sport			2
" global markets @entity57 , co author of @entity58 , an annual report examining all aspects of the sport 's finances , believes countries now have a role to play in filling the gap left by @entity6 's traditional investors			2
" the departure of the car manufacturers left a big hole in the budgets of many teams , " said @entity57			0
" in 2008 and 2009 , @entity6 lost @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 while @entity75 also slashed its spending			2
this meant that , according to @entity58 's data , team owner spending plummeted from $ 1.6 billion in 2008 to $ 611 million in 2010 , despite the addition of two new teams			0
" in turn , teams have had to look for new sources of funding to maintain their budgets			0
" @entity6 's peripatetic players visit five continents and 19 countries in 2013 -- and in 2014 there are additional races scheduled in @entity25 , @entity92 , the @entity93 and @entity94			1
part of the sport 's appeal is that it immediately gives its backers structured access to nearly 20 global markets			0
" if a government thinks that it can increase trade and tourism by presenting an image of itself as a technologically savvy , glamorous destination and a center of sporting excellence , then @entity6 is a good way to achieve this , " @entity57 continued			2
" @entity6 's values of technology and glamor are often something that developing countries want to align themselves with			2
" it 's not so common in @entity6 at the moment , but this is already a big source of funding in its feeder series @entity117			2
huge responsibility " in the last couple of years logos for countries including @entity16 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity25 and @entity127 have all appeared on the cars and @entity16 even title sponsors the @entity130 team			1
" as these drivers move into @entity6 , they will bring their sponsors with them and we 'll see more and more countries getting involved as @entity6 sponsors			2
" sponsoring a driver or team is also a powerful marketing tool			0
as well as the traditional logos prominently painted on the car 's livery , @entity16 now gets a mention every time @entity18 is strapped into a car			1
but how do the drivers cope with these unique patriotic pressures of essentially being an ambassador in a racesuit ? " i have more than many responsibilities , " @entity18 explained with a half smile			0
" i am the only one in @entity16 who has @entity6 on his back			1
it 's quite hard for me to keep everyone happy			0
" like most @entity6 racers , the 28 - year - old @entity19 driver progressed from karting through the junior ranks before winning the @entity117 title in 2010			1
but there is no doubt that the final step into an @entity6 race seat was sweetened by sponsorship from @entity15 to the tune of a reported $ 45m a year			0
" @entity15 and the sponsors i had in the past , and that i still have , believe in my talent , " said @entity18 , who is still aware that he has to sing for his supper			0
" i was the first racing driver who was racing with the colors of @entity15 , the main oil company of the country			0
" in @entity16 we do n't like to lose , we always approach to win			0
" @entity18 was not the first @entity6 pilot from @entity16 -- that honor went to @entity175 born @entity174 in 1959 -- but he became the first @entity16 to win a grand prix in @entity177 during the 2012 season			1
" you know , @entity6 after my victory last year became a very popular sport , " @entity18 explained			1
" we have two live tv channels so it 's getting bigger and bigger -- which is why i have even more responsibility			0
" presidential problem solver this season has raised @entity18 's stress levels even further			0
the @entity19 car has lagged behind its midfield rivals and @entity18 finally won the team 's first point of the season in @entity191 -- the 10th race of the year			1
the portents on the eve of the season had not been good			0
the team held a celebratory preseason lunch on 5 march but later that evening @entity16 president @entity32 died following a long battle with cancer			1
the death of @entity32 , a self - styled " @entity202 socialist , " left @entity16 in a state of flux and it arguably deprived @entity18 of his biggest supporter			1
when asked how much the late president had personally helped his career , @entity18 answered : " a lot			1
" it was not only my career it was the career of many racing drivers , @entity212 ( @entity117 ) , @entity213 , who is in @entity214 ; many , many racing drivers			0
" @entity18 twice appeared on @entity32 's chat show @entity216 but said he did not speak to the late president on a regular basis , though he added : " he was very close to the drivers			1
" there have been divisive opinions on @entity32 's legacy			0
commentators say he did a lot of work to lift people out of poverty in @entity16 but that his autocratic style of governance damaged the nation 's democracy and left the country with daunting economic challenges			0
but @entity18 says the charismatic @entity32 , the man who helped shape his career , is greatly missed			1
" we miss him , " said @entity18 who grew up in the city of @entity237			0
" everyone misses people like that who were important for the country , the position he took , what he did for the poor			0
" he connected with the people and at the same time he was listening to the problems they had , analyzing everything with his team , his ministers and directors , they were trying to solve all of the problems of the people			0
" being backed by the state has intrinsically linked @entity18 to @entity16 in so many ways			1
he is indebted to @entity15 for his position in @entity6 and in turn he feels he is an ambassador for @entity16 , his compatriots and the legacy of president @entity32			1
when countries decide to directly invest in @entity6 's drivers , the responsibility lies heavily on the racer 's shoulders			2
does @entity18 expect @entity27 , the driver @entity25 investors plan to push into a @entity20 seat , to feel the same kind of pressure ? " it depends , " @entity18 explains			1
" i do n't know very well the @entity25 guys			0
i know the @entity16 guys - for sure there is a lot of pressure ! " slums of @entity16 @entity15 's sponsorship deal with @entity19 is due to expire in 2015			1
it is understood that the terms of the agreement stipulate a @entity16 driver must race for the former world champion constructors , and not necessarily @entity18			1
@entity0 contacted @entity15 but they declined to comment			0
even if @entity18 finds himself without an @entity6 drive in the future he is already determined to pay back part of his debt he believes he owes to his country through the pastor @entity290 , a charitable organization that he set up in 2005			1
" we want to find a new driver from the very poor slums of @entity16 and give him the opportunity to become a race driver in the future in @entity6 , " @entity18 , who was encouraged into motorsport by his father and uncle , explained			1
" we are focused on finding someone who is not even close to motor racing			0
at the moment we are staging a small go kart championship and then we will select two or three racers and then put them in @entity307 with good teams , all paid for by the foundation			0
" we also help some with education , some who have lost their homes in tragedies and other sports			0
" but now we are planning to find the second or third @entity16 driver for a @entity6 drive			1
" @entity18 is using his foundation to repay what @entity16 has given to him -- and , even better , he hopes it will also find a successor to drive forward the expectations of a nation .			1

@entity6 is attracting state funding form nations such as @entity16 and @entity25
pastor @entity18 says being sponsored by @entity16 money is " a huge responsibility "
the @entity19 driver was personally encouraged into @entity6 by late president @entity32
@entity18 has set up a foundation to fund next @entity16 @entity6 driver
