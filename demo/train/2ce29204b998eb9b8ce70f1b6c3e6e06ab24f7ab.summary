-- editor 's note : @entity3 is author of the best - selling book , " rising from @entity7 , " which explores how citizens recover from disasters			1
she was a @entity0 correspondent for 18 years			2
for the last year my dining room has looked like the local post office , minus the junk mail			1
stacks of letters from around the country piled high			1
but in this case , there was only one destination -- @entity18			2
while most were collecting money to help the survivors of the earthquake , tsunami and nuclear crisis , i wanted to send something equally crucial to their recovery : hope			1
" @entity31 " began in march 2011 with a trickle , just 10 letters , all from individuals			1
but soon they were pouring in at the rate of 200 a day ! schools , churches , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 troops			0
in the end , some 5568 cards and letters arrived from the @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 making it the largest letter - writing campaign for @entity18 in the country			1
so many felt moved to offer words of support and condolence to those who had lost so much			1
the most touching letters came from the @entity55 where i 'd grown up			1
people there understood what @entity18 was going through and were eager to " pay it forward " because of the help and encouragement they received after @entity7			1
" for months , you never heard the sound of a bird			0
i missed that most of all			0
there were times when we thought that we would never have a normal life again , " wrote a grandmother from @entity68 , @entity69 , where a storm surge similar in height to the tsunami had decimated nearly every building near the beach			1
" we learned so much from it , however , " she continued			0
" you can live with a small amount of food each day ; water is very precious ; family and friends are the most important ; and @entity85 loves us			0
" a @entity87 teenager penned a three - page letter and described spending days stuck in the @entity90			1
" when we left the city , the sun was shining so brightly			0
i looked up and smiled because i learned that after a storm , there is sunshine			0
rays of sun will shine upon your heart , body and soul when you feel alone in the dark or when you are about to give up			0
" a @entity102 , @entity69 , 10 - year - old drew on her post-katrina experience when she warned the @entity18 to " stop digging through gunk and mud			1
... if you keep doing that soon you will get sick			0
and if you get sick you wo n't have medicine to cure yourself			0
" many cards and letters simply exuded joy and optimism			1
flowers , rainbows , hearts and smiley faces accompanied exhortations to " @entity118 , " " @entity119 , " " @entity120 , " and " @entity121 ! " i 'd planned to send the letters straight to @entity18 , but an industrious woman in @entity125 , @entity126 , offered to translate them since not all @entity18 speak @entity128			1
@entity129 organized more than 200 volunteers around the world to painstakingly translate each card			1
the project was a godsend for translators who had helplessly watched the disasters unfold			0
" i have been extremely frustrated being so far away from home and not being able to do anything to help the survivors of the earthquake , other than just sending money , " e-mailed @entity138 volunteer @entity137			1
and by all accounts , the letters have helped			1
our first batch of one thousand went to a middle school in @entity149 that had been turned into a shelter			0
@entity18 philanthropist dr. @entity151 hosted a surprise concert there , handing out letters and posting dozens on bulletin boards for the audience to read			2
" though the damage in the disaster area is awful , i believe that these letters must warm victims ' hearts very much			1
i do n't know how to thank you , " he e-mailed afterwards			0
the @entity162 ( @entity162 ) in @entity163 has delivered the majority of the letters			2
@entity166 , coordinator of @entity162 relief efforts , sent photos of a group of school children he encountered in @entity171 on the four - month anniversary of the tsunami praying at the shoreline near the site of their destroyed school			2
he handed out cards and completely changed the somber mood			0
" they had all just been crying minutes before			0
can you believe it ? " he marveled			0
the tsunami had so badly damaged the robes in a kimono store in @entity186 , @entity18 , that the plan was to shutter it			2
encouraged by the letter he received from " @entity31 , " the owner changed his mind and decided to re-open his business			2
a @entity194 woman received a response from a woman in @entity197 whose town was destroyed by the tsunami			2
" she said my letter made her very strong and smile , " said @entity199			2
" it made her realize that she has wonderful friends all over the world			0
" simple , old - fashioned snail mail			0
not even we realized the power it would have .			0

" @entity214 " is a letter writing campaign for earthquake , tsunami victims
@entity3 started the " @entity214 " campaign a year *ago*
