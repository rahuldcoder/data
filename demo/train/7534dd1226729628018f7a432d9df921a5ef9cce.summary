now though , it has to go through the @entity46			2

a group of colonists disguised themselves as @entity132 , went on ships in @entity134 , and dumped hundreds of chests of tea overboard			0
what they were protesting against was the @entity139			0
remember , the @entity57 colonies were controlled by @entity141 back then			0
some colonists were angry about the taxes being created by the @entity145 government			0
the @entity145 parliament was furious about the @entity112 and set up more laws in @entity5			0
all of this helped to eventually lead to the @entity149			0
shoutout @entity150 @entity151 , @entity22 : time for a @entity152 ! who is the founder of @entity155 ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity160 , b ) @entity161 , c ) @entity163 or @entity121 ) @entity159 ? another three seconds on the clock -- go ! @entity159 started the social networking site when he was a student at @entity166			1
that 's your answer and that 's your @entity152 ! @entity171 @entity33 : that was back in 2003			1
in 2010 , @entity159 is @entity173 's person of the year			1
@entity173 is owned by @entity174 , the same company that owns @entity0			1
other people who were considered for this year 's award : the @entity178 miners , the @entity112 movement , and the founder of @entity181			1
@entity173 said that it chose @entity159 because his social networking site has had a huge impact on how we communicate and do business			1
the magazine pointed out that @entity155 has linked one - twelfth of the entire world into a single network			1
if @entity155 was a country , it would be the third largest country on the planet			1
what @entity193 ? @entity33 : nearly half of all @entity132 have a @entity155 account			1
we know a lot of you do			0
when you post something online , even if it 's meant to be private , there 's a good chance it can end up being public			1
i talked with some @entity205 - area teens and their parents recently about how much privacy they expect to have when they log on			0
( begin video ) @entity33 : as far as phones go , and sharing your numbers , how many of you expect your numbers to remain private ? and have you ever gotten a text or a call from a number you did n't recognize ? @entity17 : yes @entity218 , student : but that 's normally from someone that 's given my number to someone else , not that i approved it			1
so , never mind , hand goes down ! @entity229 , student : i tell my friends not to give away my phone number , but it still happens			0
@entity33 : these suburban @entity205 teenagers may want their phone number to be private , but i found their expectations were very different when it comes to the internet			0
do you expect what you post online to be private ? @entity241 : no , i do n't			0
@entity33 : why not ? @entity241 : everyone sees it , the internet			0
it 's the world wide web ; everyone can get to it			1
i 'm pretty careful about what i put on it			0
@entity249 , student : i know nothing 's really private			1
@entity33 : so , how does that affect what you post on @entity155 ? @entity255 : i do n't say anything that i do n't want anyone to hear			1
@entity33 : it 's a caution instilled by their parents			1
how much privacy do you give him on @entity155 ? @entity264 , parent : very little			1
if they do want privacy , they can get a journal , they can write in it , keep it in their desk drawer			0
i will never read it			0
but when you 're posting something that everyone can look at , i 'm going to look at it also			0
@entity279 , parent : anything you 're willing to put out there in a written form , be willing to stand up in front of the whole high school and announce this			0
@entity287 , parent : well , i teach in a school , so we deal with a lot of these issues each day			0
and so , i sometimes talk about situations that i 've encountered at work and hoping that maybe something would be learned from those as well			0
@entity33 : and while all three students said they 'd texted something they wished they could take back , they were far more reserved in their internet behavior , largely because of their parents ' involvement			1
@entity303 , parent : professing the ignorance of it and not monitoring it , i think you 're setting yourself up for failure as a parent			0
i think the kids definitely need guidance			0
( @entity312 ) career connections @entity33 : it 's time for another edition of @entity313			1
our own @entity316 joins me here			0
@entity316 , i hear you 're focusing on the investigative side of journalism today			1
@entity321 , @entity322 news associate producer : that 's right , @entity26			1
@entity325 is an investigative reporter and correspondent for @entity0			0
before she started working here , she moved to @entity83 to help improve herself as a journalist			0
@entity325 credits her mother for helping her decide what career path she wanted to take			1
and she says she 's successful because she has a passion for journalism and knew she could n't fail at it			1
( begin video ) @entity325 , @entity336 : the reason i love being a journalist is that you can really make a huge difference in society			0
a video , i say , can say a million words			0
general assignment is more you do the breaking news , the quick - turn stories that feed the daily news			1
you 'll find a lot more general assignment reporters than you ever will investigative reporters			1
investigative is more like , we find one issue and maybe spend sometimes an entire year looking into it and getting down to the bottom of it			1
it 's more documentary style			1
one thing you 'll have to learn in news more than anything is that , how can you make your story different , how can you get the public 's attention ? my whole goal with @entity370 is to be able to bring them on stories with us			1
let them experience the story , kind of , we 're going to be taking a journey and i 'm going to bring you with me			0
so , with the backpack , i look at it as , okay , i 'm going to throw on my backpack and come with me ; we 're going to go on a journey to find the story			1
and i just try to make it really intimate with viewers so that they can connect to it			0
a lesson to everybody , whether you 're a journalist or any other type of career , is be willing to take risks			1
because if you 're truly passionate about it , follow your passion and success will follow , and it will pay off in the end			0

the blog , the @entity407 : they 're both at @entity403 ! before we go @entity33 : before we go , we 've got a tail that takes a long time to tell			0
that 's how long @entity414 here has been around			2
that would make her 175 in dog years			0
and if the folks at the record books can confirm that , she will officially be the oldest dog in the world			0
@entity414 's owner has to provide the proof , and that includes the seven years before he adopted her			2
goodbye @entity33 : you know , the part of her life that he mist - y. hey , at least we did n't make a joke about an old dog needing to walk with a cane - ine			0
