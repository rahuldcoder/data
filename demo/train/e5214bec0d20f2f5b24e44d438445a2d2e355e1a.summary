editor 's note : the rev. @entity2 is writer in residence and adjunct professor of theology at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
a priest of the diocese of @entity7 with a doctoral degree , he is the author of several books on the @entity13 , including " @entity14 : denial and the @entity16 " and " freeing @entity17 , " both published by @entity18			0
for another view on this topic , read here			0
the rev. @entity2 says the debate over celibacy for priests will be around for decades			1
( @entity24 ) -- it 's an issue that simply wo n't go away			0
in spite of signals from the @entity29 discouraging even discussions of obligatory celibacy for @entity13 priests , the almost 1,000 - year - old rule is under the microscope			1
and it will be for decades to come			0
in the @entity13 tradition , even though sex is cast as sinful unless expressed in the conjugal embrace of husband and wife , it is held as fundamentally good , a part of @entity43 's creation			0
the church even holds that marriage ( including spousal lovemaking ) is a sacrament -- something sacred that contributes to the sanctity of husbands and wives			1
in light of this official teaching , it is dawning on many @entity55 that mandatory celibacy for priests , a canonically imposed discipline of the church , is precisely that -- a discipline			1
they are asking , " how is it that a discipline of the church has been allowed to trump a sacrament of the church ? " in effect , the church is saying that should @entity43 call a man to the priesthood , @entity43 will not , at the same time , call that individual to the sacrament of marriage			1
it 's right to ask , how does the church know this ? public opinion surveys indicate that most @entity55 , priests included , believe the discipline of celibacy needs a serious review			1
recently the retired archbishop of @entity84 , cardinal @entity83 , observed that obligatory celibacy is open for discussion			2
it is not , @entity83 noted , a matter of dogma			0
for decades now , bishops from @entity91 , @entity92 and the @entity93 have asked @entity95 officials to consider optional celibacy for priests			1
the church 's official response is consistent and succinct : as a precious gift from @entity43 , the discipline of celibacy for priests will remain in place			1
this , in spite of the inherent paradox lying just below the claim that the gift of celibacy is a precious gift of @entity43 to the priesthood and the church : how can a gift be legislated ? the church answers that if a man is called to the priesthood , @entity43 will grant him the gift of celibacy			1
many priests today wonder how church leaders know this			1
reading the mind of @entity43 in this matter -- in any matter of church discipline -- is risky business			2
more and more @entity55 today are coming to understand that celibacy as a universal law for priests had its origins in the 12th century and that during the church 's first millennium , priests and bishops -- and at least thirty - nine popes -- were married			1
still , most well - read cradle @entity55 are surprised to learn that @entity135 , pope from 399 to 401 , was succeeded by his son , pope @entity137 , and that a century later pope st. @entity139 ' son , @entity141 , also was elected to the papacy			0
even in our secular world , it 's common to speak of church - based ministry as a calling , a vocation			2
is n't it possible that @entity43 would call an individual to the priesthood and to the sacrament of marriage ? @entity43 apparently did so for more than half the church 's history			1
how do we know that @entity43 is n't doing so today ? for some years now i 've been teaching in the religious studies department at @entity6 in @entity7			2
i 've asked dozens of serious , healthy young students if they have given any thought to being a priest			0
they seem flattered by the question			0
with only one exception , each has answered , " yes , i 've thought about being a priest , but i want a family			0
" there are , of course , other factors , urgent and pressing , that will keep the celibacy issue alive			2
the @entity13 priesthood is aging			0
the average age of active priests hovers at 60 , and if retired priests are factored in , it is considerably higher			2
moreover , @entity13 seminaries are lucky to be half full			0
parish staffing challenges alone will press for a review of the celibacy rule			0
catholic bishops simply do not have enough priests to meet the pastoral and sacramental needs of the @entity13 faithful			0
closing and merging parishes may offer some temporary relief for overworked priests , but the shortfall of priests will continue to challenge the vitality of @entity13 parishes and the health of catholic clergy for decades to come			0
but the most human , existential factor that should keep the celibacy issue on the table is the spiritual and emotional health of priests			1
celibacy really is n't the issue -- mandatory or obligatory celibacy is			0
there are many priests who do possess the gift of celibacy -- it is their " truth " so to speak -- and their humanity , warmth and pastoral effectiveness give abundant evidence of their authentic celibate lives			1
but there remain other priests who believe deep down they are called to the priesthood but not to celibacy			1
and for these men , the burden of mandated celibacy threatens their spiritual and emotional well - being			1
the priesthood may be their " truth , " but mandated celibacy wraps them in a cloak of loneliness and struggle			1
i do n't know father @entity230			0
he appears to have touched the lives of many and preached the gospel with power and conviction			0
i suspect he feels called by @entity43 to be a priest , but not a celibate priest			0
surely he knows that @entity13 priests are allowed to marry and that the church welcomes into the priesthood married convert ministers from other christian denominations			1
surely he knows that in many parts of the @entity13 world , clerical celibacy is openly flouted , and church authorities choose not to notice			2
i wonder if church officials understand the burden they place on the shoulders of a man who believes he is called to priestly ministry but not to celibacy			2
certainly , a married priesthood will have burdens of its own and , sadly , scandals of its own -- infidelity and abuse among others			0
but it should be left to the individual priest and seminarian to determine whether or not he is blessed with the gift of celibacy			2
a mandated " gift , " after all , is really no gift at all			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the rev. @entity2 .			1

the rev. @entity2 : celibacy is 1,000 years old but not *intrinsic* to the church
many popes were married in the first millennium of the church , @entity2 says
@entity2 says church views marriage as sacred ; why should priests be denied it ?
@entity2 : celibacy is a gift that should be optional , not mandated by the church
