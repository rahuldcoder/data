-- could you survive on four hours sleep a day ? what about coming face - to - face with waves the size of three - storey buildings ? or not seeing your loved ones for an entire year ? as the @entity9 set sail from @entity11 on sunday , 670 amateur sailors will soon find out if they have what it takes to complete one of the most grueling sporting challenges known to man -- sailing around the globe			1
over the next year they will travel through the harshest conditions on the planet -- facing everything from wild storms in the @entity22 , to frustratingly calm seas near the equator			1
the 12 yachts , each measuring 21 meters , will visit 15 ports on six continents			0
while some sailors will join for a month - long leg of the journey , others will quit their jobs and say goodbye to their family and friends for the full 11 - month circumnavigation			1
but despite the almost superhuman challenge ahead of them , many of the competitors had until recently never set sail in their life			1
from 18 - year - old students to 70 - year - old retirees , the gutsy sailors taking part in this year 's race will -- quite literally -- be thrown in the deep end			1
" for most people it will be the first time they 're sleeping and living on a boat for a long period of time , " said @entity46 , who completed the 2012 race			0
" they 'll have to get used to the uncomfortable conditions , lack of sleep , and shift work -- usually four hours on , four hours off			2
then there 's the weather -- in all your training you ca n't really experience your first big storm , " added the 29 - year - old it engineer from @entity11			1
founded in 1996 by sir @entity63 -- the first person to sail solo , non-stop , around the world in 1969 -- the @entity64 revolves around the notion anyone can circumnavigate the globe , regardless of their experience			0
the only selection criteria is people must be over 18 , pass a three - week sailing course and be physically fit enough to complete the epic voyage			2
but at around Â £ 43,000 ( $ 67,000 ) per person for a full year - long voyage , it 's not simply a huge physical undertaking , but a significant financial one			2
" it 's a little bit like moving country -- you have to say goodbye to everyone you know			0
all your possessions are broken down into one bag for an entire year , " said @entity46			0
" @entity88 motto is that ' anyone can do it			0
' i was just an average guy working in the city , not a massive adventurer like sir @entity63			0
but i did it , and i 've come out of it so much stronger and with so much more self - belief			2
