-- @entity1 have been untouchable for the last two @entity3 seasons , but their double world champion driver @entity4 has warned the team 's 2012 car will be slower than last year 's model			1
@entity4 , @entity3 's youngest two - time champion having won the drivers ' crown in 2010 and 2011 , also expects this season 's title race to be much tighter , after he took the checkered flag in 11 of 19 grands prix last year			1
" last season the way we incorporated the exhaust was very cleverly devised , " the 24 - year - old told the sport 's official website			1
" it made the car faster by generating more grip , but it 's a thing of the past in 2012 and for now we have to live with it			2
" i would say that goes for all the other teams as well			0
we are looking into ways of getting that grip level back and i am sure we will succeed , although it will take time			0
@entity1 out to dominate again " of course we hope to do it again this season			1
my guess is that the performance of the cars will be even closer this year , especially the gap between the front - running teams and the midfield			2
we will probably even see a few surprises			0
" if the @entity41 could take the championship in 2012 , he would join @entity44 's @entity43 and compatriot and seven - time title winner @entity45 as the only men to have won the sport 's biggest prize three years in a row			1
" i was n't aware that only two drivers have done it , " he said			2
" but as the saying goes , three 's a charm , so let 's try to do it again this year ! " @entity4 will be in distinguished company on the grid when the season begins in @entity60 next month , with six former world champions competing in the same season for the first time			1
alongside him will be @entity45 at @entity64 , @entity68 's title - winning @entity66 duo of @entity69 and @entity70 , @entity72 's two - time winner @entity71 and the returning 2007 champion @entity73 at @entity74			1
" as it has never happened before , it is something very special , " he said			0
" and to be one of those six feels even better			0
but then again , this is something that points to the past and has nothing to do with the next 20 races , as it does n't make you any faster			2
" it is a new game when we start on the @entity87 grid			0
past glory is great to have , but you have to make sure that it reaches into the here and now			0
" the forthcoming season is scheduled to be the longest in the elite division of motorsport 's 52 - year history , with 20 races on the calendar			1
@entity4 was not overly concerned by the addition of an extra race , with the @entity101 @entity100 returning in @entity102 in november , but he felt no further additions should be made to the schedule in the future			1
" twenty races is indeed a huge workload but to be honest whether it 's 19 or 20 races does n't make any real difference			2
there are few sports with such a long season , so i would suggest that we all just roll up our sleeves			0
" i think it will be important to pace yourself cleverly and you will probably have to use the phrase ' thanks , but no thanks ' more often			0
you ca n't have your finger in every pie , however alluring it may look			0

@entity1 's @entity4 says the team will not be as quick as last year
the @entity41 has won the world championship in each of the last two seasons
@entity4 has set his sights on a *record* - equaling third drivers ' title in a row
the 24 - year - old says the sport should not expand beyond a 20 - race calendar
