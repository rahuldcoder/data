-- a man suspected of flying with tuberculosis tested negative for the disease , according to @entity5 health officials , meaning there was never a risk to other passengers on his flight			1
the man was held in @entity11 from saturday until monday night , when he was released from the hospital			1
he is free to travel as he is no longer on the @entity15 's " @entity16 " list , health officials said			1
passengers aboard @entity18 were waiting on the tarmac at @entity11 's @entity20 on friday when their pilot came on the intercom			1
" we 've been notified about a health emergency aboard the aircraft , " passenger @entity23 heard			1
a few minutes later , @entity23 saw a flight attendant walk toward another passenger sitting a few rows ahead of him			0
the flight attendant handed the slender middle - aged man a medical mask			1
emergency personnel boarded the plane a short time later and removed the man , @entity23 said			2
a firefighter then came on the intercom and announced that the passenger had active tuberculosis and was contagious and that other passengers on the flight had been exposed			2
he advised them to contact their physicians immediately , @entity23 said			0
the @entity44 was operating under the assumption that the @entity15 only puts a passenger on its " @entity16 " list if the passenger has a confirmed infectious disease , said dr. @entity50 , the fire department 's chief medical officer			1
@entity50 and battalion chief @entity52 instructed captain @entity53 on what to say to passengers aboard the plane			0
@entity58 health officials did not recommend passengers on @entity18 seek medical care because even if the passenger had tuberculosis , their risk of being infected was " very , very low , " said dr. @entity64 , disease control director for @entity66			1
" to put this in perspective ... we 're much more concerned that the passengers on this flight contracted influenza than that they contracted @entity74 , " she said monday			1
the @entity18 flight took off from @entity76 , @entity77 , according to airline spokesman @entity78			0
it landed in @entity11 approximately two hours later on a layover before it was scheduled to fly to @entity81			2
there was no warning or flag on the passenger 's record when he was going through security or when he boarded the plane , @entity78 said			0
after the plane took off , the @entity15 notified the @entity90 of a possible risk			2
the @entity90 then notified @entity18 , @entity78 said			0
fast facts about tuberculosis @entity74 is caused by a bacterium called @entity95 , which mainly affects the lungs			2
it can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys , spine and brain			0
there are two types of @entity74 : latent @entity74 infection , which is not contagious , and @entity74 disease , which is contagious			2
a person infected with latent @entity74 shows no sign of symptoms and may not feel sick			2
someone with @entity74 disease usually feels ill ; they may be coughing up blood and may have a fever , night sweats and / or chest pain			2
@entity74 spreads through the air when a person with an active @entity74 infection coughs , sneezes or speaks			2
germs can stay in the air for hours			0
people who contract @entity74 must take several medications for six to nine months to combat the infection , according to the @entity15			1
some varieties of the @entity74 bacterium have developed a resistance to common antibiotics and may be more difficult to treat			2
people with weakened immune systems , such as those with @entity132 , are particularly susceptible to the disease			0
the number of @entity74 cases in the @entity136 has been declining since 1992 , according to the @entity15			1
in 2010 , the most recent @entity15 data available , there were 569 deaths from @entity74			1
in january 2010 , a person infected with an active case of tuberculosis flew from @entity143 to @entity144 on @entity18 despite being on the @entity15 's " @entity16 " list , which is different from the @entity90 's " @entity147 " list			1
the @entity16 list was created in 2007 after @entity151 lawyer @entity149 traveled abroad with a drug - resistant case of tuberculosis , setting off an international health scare			1
speaker insisted that he had not been told he was contagious ; public health officials disagreed			1
the @entity15 manages the @entity16 list in coordination with the @entity157			1
the list is authorized under the @entity159 of 2001 , according to the @entity15			1
local and state health officials can contact the @entity15 to request that someone be placed on the list			1
" to include someone on the list , @entity15 must determine that the person 1 ) likely is contagious with a communicable disease that would constitute a serious public health threat should the person be permitted to board a flight ; 2 ) is unaware of or likely to be nonadherent with public health recommendations , including treatment ; and 3 ) likely will attempt to board a commercial aircraft , " the @entity15 website states			1
" once a person is placed on the list , airlines are instructed not to issue a boarding pass to the person for any commercial domestic flight or for any commercial international flight arriving in or departing from the @entity136			0
" the @entity16 list does not apply to other methods of transportation			1
the @entity15 reviews the records of every person on the list every two weeks to see whether they are eligible to fly again			1
in general , airline passengers are not legally obligated to tell an airline when they are sick , said @entity189 , an attorney who specializes in travel law			0
unlike cruise lines , which require you to disclose illnesses leading up to the cruise , he said , airlines do not include any language in the ticket purchasing process that would prevent you from traveling			0
" if you have some disease and its contagious , where 's the threshold ? " he asked			0
" if you have the flu ? if you have a really bad cold ? i think that once you establish some rule that there has to be notification , it becomes a slippery slope			0
" as a " common carrier , " @entity189 said , airlines are legally required to do as much as possible to ensure the safety of their passengers			0
if a passenger appears too ill to survive the flight without medical assistance , an airline could prevent him from flying , he said			0
or if the airline knew that a passenger had a contagious disease , employees could require her to wear a mask during the flight to prevent germs from spreading			0
in this kind of situation , any legal troubles would more likely stem from a civil lawsuit			0
after the 2007 incident , speaker was sued by eight of his fellow passengers in a @entity234 court			0
@entity189 said plaintiffs would have to show that the infected passenger knew that he had the disease and was extremely careless around his fellow travelers			0
" the line is crossed when the person knows they 're sick and intentionally tries to do something ( to infect others ) or acts with callous disregard for your well - being , " @entity189 said			0
@entity0 's @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 contributed to this story .			0
