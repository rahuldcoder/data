-- the mascot for the 2012 @entity3 soccer championship co-hosted by @entity4 and @entity5 has been officially unveiled : a pair of footballing brothers wearing the jerseys of each nation			1
critics might say that @entity11 and its design company @entity12 have hardly displayed originality , because the mascot for @entity15 , co-hosted by @entity16 and @entity17 , was twin brothers " @entity19 and @entity20			2
" but love them or hate them , the spiky - haired pair will doubtless make a small fortune in memorabilia and associated sales for the 2012 organizers and @entity11 's ruling body			0
the use and marketing of commercially - designed mascots at major football competitions began in 1966 for the @entity33 held in @entity34 , who beat @entity36 4 - 2 in the final			1
flushed by that success , the " @entity39 " mascot proved an immediate hit and helped swell the coffers of the @entity43 , so it was inevitable that the innovation was here to stay			1
but while @entity47 is acknowledged to be a creative masterpiece , particularly for its time , others have been panned by the critics			1
@entity0 has compiled a football team 's line - up of them to compare the best and the worst in our photo gallery			1
feel free to add your own contributions in the comment box below			0
@entity39 ( 1966 @entity33 , @entity34 ) the first , and some people say , best of all football mascots , although the choice of @entity67 red , white and blue for the lion 's outfit , when the tournament was hosted by @entity34 alone , was in retrospect a strange decision			1
@entity39 ( 1974 @entity33 , @entity36 ) the 1974 hosts kitted out two boys in the white shirts of the national team , emblazoned with the initials @entity74 ( @entity75 ) -- which is @entity76 for @entity33			1
although it has the look of a hastily - drawn cartoon , it brought good luck to the hosts who beat the @entity83 2 - 1 in the final			0
@entity85 ( @entity86 , @entity87 ) next year 's @entity88 in @entity89 has a whole family of mascots			2
jerboas are a rodent found in the desert in that area , which does not inspire confidence in the overall concept			0
@entity39 ( @entity98 , @entity99 ) the cockerel , a national symbol of @entity99 , was a natural choice for a mascot -- and by the end of the competition it was crowing very loudly as the hosts upset @entity108 3 - 0 in the final			1
@entity110 ( 2010 @entity33 , @entity111 ) " @entity110 is a jolly , self - confident , adventurous , spontaneous , and actually quite shrewd little fellow			2
he loves to perform and always follows his instinct and intuition , yet sometimes has the tendency to exaggerate a bit , " said the blurb on @entity114 's official website			0
love him or hate him , he made a lot of money for football 's world governing body , whose revenues now top $ 1 billion per year			2
the @entity125 ( 2002 @entity33 , @entity126 and @entity127 ) apparently the first computer - generated mascots , the @entity125 were an acquired taste and appeared to be based on @entity131 figures which were popular at the time			1
striker ( 1994 @entity33 , @entity134 ) the @entity134 public , who clearly adore dogs , voted for the loveable animal which , like @entity39 , wore the red , white and blue of the hosts			1
some might say it proved a pup			2
@entity142 ( @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 ) it 's always a problem for co-hosts of tournaments to design mascots or logos which can fit both national identities			2
the clue to this mascot is in the name			0
@entity157 countries @entity144 and the @entity145 put on the 2000 @entity158			0
an odd mix of a lion with a devil 's horn and tail			0
@entity164 1986 ( 1996 @entity33 , @entity165 ) the @entity166 were awarded the competition -- only 16 years after their 1970 staging -- when @entity169 pulled out			1
the mascot has a last - minute look to it and , designed in the shape of a jalapeno pepper with a mustache and sombrero , reinforced a national stereotype			0
@entity19 and @entity20 ( @entity178 2008 , @entity16 and @entity17 ) the androgynous twin brothers did not confine themselves to on - field activities			0
they also appeared in an animated music video by @entity182 , who penned the official song of @entity15 " like a superstar			0
" neither the mascots nor the video lived up to the name			0
yet to be named ( @entity178 2012 , @entity5 and @entity4 ) the public can vote for the names of another set of mascot brothers on @entity11 's official website			1
the result will be announced on 2004 .			0

the 1966 @entity33 saw the first competition mascot named " @entity39 "
@entity47 , a lion dressed in a union jack outfit , proved a commercial success
