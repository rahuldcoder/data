-- speaking to @entity1 is like plunging into dreamlike darkness			1
the sunlight falls away as you dive deeper and deeper underwater with him , and you ca n't help but hold your breath a little as he describes the alien creatures hovering at the edge of vision			0
@entity1 is a master aquanaut -- and the grandson of legendary diver @entity16			1
his @entity18 accent , with soft @entity20 undertones , guides me 20 meters below the surface of the water until we rest our imaginary flippers at a very special spot on the ocean floor -- 14 kilometers off the coast of @entity28			1
it 's cold down here , around 35 degrees @entity31			0
the enormous water pressure -- three times the atmosphere on land -- bears down on us , filling our veins with nitrogen and creating the feeling of being ever so slightly drunk			0
as our eyes adjust to the gloom , twinkling yellow lights reveal a steel capsule the size of a school bus , with small portholes providing a glimpse of the scientists working inside			1
welcome to " @entity47 " , the only underwater laboratory in the world , and @entity1 's home for a record - breaking 31 days			1
@entity1 's legacy fifty years after his famous grandfather , @entity16 , spent 30 days living in an underwater village at the bottom of the @entity55 , @entity1 will follow in his footsteps with a similar project twice as deep and one day longer			1
in 1963 , @entity16 elder turned science fiction into reality when he and a team of five divers lived in an underwater habitat -- named " @entity64 " -- researching the effects of deep sea living			1
the pioneering experiment found cuts and grazes healed quicker and hair grew slower			0
new species of animals were discovered and @entity16 's haunting video diary was turned into an oscar winning documentary , " @entity75 " " i hope we recapture the magic , mystery and beauty of the ocean which my grandfather was able to offer the world for so many decades , " said @entity1 , who takes the plunge on september 30			1
mission 31 this will be a new era of ocean exploration as the team of six aquanauts -- dubbed " @entity89 " -- examine not just the physical and psychological effects of underwater living , but the impact of climate change			1
they will use space - age motorcycles to cruise the ocean floor nine hours a day , examining marine life , coral reefs , and ocean acidity -- which is linked to carbon emissions in the air			2
" it 's very much in the same spirit of adventure and exploration as in my grandfather 's day , " said 45 - year - old @entity1			1
" but by default we 're living in a time where human impact is directly related to the ocean 's health			2
" " the ocean contains 99 % of the planet 's total living space			2
that said , we know so little about it -- just 5 % has been explored			0
" underwater " @entity119 " while audiences in the 1960s had to wait for @entity16 's groundbreaking documentary to hit cinemas , this time round we 'll be able to follow @entity1 every step of the way , thanks to rolling coverage on the @entity131 , @entity122 video calls to classrooms around the world , @entity135 and @entity136 updates , and ultimately an @entity138 film			1
this is n't just a new age of environmental frontiers , but media management , as " @entity47 " also welcomes celebrities on board , including @entity146 business magnate @entity145 and pop singer will.i.am			0
" we 'll have millions of eyeballs looking at us -- a bit like an underwater @entity119 , " said @entity1			2
" inside , it looks much like a submarine , with bunk beds , a kitchenette and a laboratory			0
it actually gets very warm in the habitat -- almost as humid as the @entity157			0
" risky business this will be the longest stint researchers have spent on @entity47 -- the previous record was 18 days -- and the ambitious mission will not be without risk			2
diver @entity164 died after his equipment malfunctioned outside the lab in 2009			0
the team will spend 15 days in extreme training , including diving 20 meters underwater , taking off their masks , being spun around to lose their bearings and then swimming back to the habitat			1
" the point of training is to make sure we 're prepared for every situation , " said @entity1 , who has been diving since he was four			2
" once your veins are fully saturated in nitrogen you wo n't be able to go back to the surface because of the decompression sickness -- we 'll have to slowly come back up over 24 hours			0
" magic realm for @entity16 , who grew up playing on the salt - stained deck of his grandfather 's boat , the ocean is a bewitching realm -- and one he wants to share with a world which has seen more people travel into deep space than deep sea			1
" being in the water is a dream , it 's part fantasy , " he says			0
" it still holds so much magic and mystery and i can only imagine what kind of sea creatures will be coming up to us during those experiments in the dark			0
" " my grandfather said people protect what they love			0
but how can you protect what you do n't understand ? "			0
