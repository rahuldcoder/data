-- there will be a good deal of public singing these next few days , during the parties , celebrations and services surrounding the inauguration , and at the inaugural ceremonies themselves			2
democrats and @entity10 alike will join voices and sing " @entity12 , " " @entity13 " and other patriotic songs			1
politicians and regular citizens , regardless of where they align themselves along the liberal - conservative continuum , have long been able to put aside their differences as they blend their voices for certain time - honored lyrics : " my country 't is of thee , sweet land of liberty ... " " o beautiful , for spacious skies , for amber waves of grain ... " but the song that is the centerpiece of every inauguration , and of virtually every formal public appearance by a president of the @entity37 , will be heard instrumentally these next few days -- yet will not be sung			1
the song is " @entity39			1
" most people are probably unaware that it even has lyrics			2
we 're accustomed to hearing the @entity44 play the stirring , brass - heavy chords as the president comes into sight			0
why are the words to the song seldom sung ? when you read them , it 's easy to surmise one possible reason			1
in our hyper - partisan times , it would be unrealistic to assume that members of the party out of power would want to enthusiastically belt them out			0
take this year , for example			0
try to envision the television pictures of @entity63 , were " @entity39 " expected to be sung by all the attendees			1
president @entity65 appears from inside the @entity66 , some of the tv cameras focus on @entity10 congressional leaders @entity70 or @entity71 or @entity72 -- and they are presumed to wish to ardently vocalize : " @entity39 we have chosen for the nation , @entity39 ! we salute him , one and all , @entity39 , as we pledge cooperation in proud fulfillment of a great , noble call			1
yours is the aim to make this grand country grander , this you will do , that 's our strong , firm belief			0
hail to the one we selected as commander , hail to the president ! @entity39 ! " yes , those are the lyrics to " @entity39 " -- and it 's no wonder that few people have ever heard them			1
they express a lovely all - american sentiment , but -- especially in our superheated political climate -- they possess the potential for some pretty awkward moments of public crooning			2
go back a few years			0
try to picture , during the administration of @entity99 , the trio of @entity100 , @entity101 and then - sen. @entity65 raising their voices in song to warble in @entity99 's direction : " @entity39 , as we pledge cooperation ... " or imagine , during @entity108 's time in office , the sight and sound of @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 harmonizing as they gaze at @entity108 : " yours is the aim to make this country grander / this you will do , that 's our strong , firm belief ... " if , in these political times , the words to " @entity39 " sound a little odd , the history of the song is also not short on oddity			1
the phrase -- " @entity39 " -- originated in @entity126 in 1810 as part of a poem by sir @entity129			1
the poem , " @entity130 , " had nothing to do with the @entity37 , or with the presidency			0
but the story told in the poem 's plot became a @entity137 stage play that made it across the ocean within a few years			0
among the songs that came to the @entity37 as part of the play was " @entity39 , " written by @entity143			1
it was given new lyrics to honor the presidency , and reportedly was used in that context for the first time at an 1815 ceremony to commemorate the birthday of @entity151			2
it was played at the inaugurations of presidents @entity154 in 1837 and @entity155 in 1841 , according to historians , and during the administration of president @entity158 from 1845 to 1849 it became routinely played any time the president entered a room during public occasions			2
not everyone was in love with the song			2
president @entity165 , who served from 1881 to 1885 , directed the leader of the @entity44 to compose a new one to replace it			0
fortunately for @entity165 , the leader of the @entity44 at the time was a pretty fair songwriter -- a young @entity44 sergeant major by the name of @entity172			0
he came up with a new tune called " @entity174			0
" unfortunately for " @entity174 , " it never caught on , and " @entity39 " made a return			1
@entity172 was undeterred ; he would go on to write , among other patriotic classics , " @entity178			0
" president @entity182 , in seeking to make the trappings of his presidency a little less regal , asked that " @entity39 " not be played when he made public entrances			1
this turned out to be a highly unpopular decision			0
@entity182 would later tell @entity186 : " one of the most unpleasant things that surprised me was when i quit having ' @entity39 ' every time i entered a room , but there was an outcry of condemnation			1
" before long , " @entity39 " was back			1
the @entity44 continues to play it as presidents make their entrances			0
the words , however , continue to mostly go unsung , and that will almost certainly be the case during the inaugural festivities these next few days			1
in the spirit of the history of this -- and as a nod to what might have been -- we leave you with a parting gift of music			0
on behalf of @entity165 , please click and enjoy the song you never got the chance to tap your feet to			0
ladies and gentlemen , the @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 performs , for your listening pleasure , " presidential polonaise			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : patriotic songs sung at inauguration wo *n't* *include* " @entity39 "
that song is usually played , not sung . the lyrics might not *fly* in the political moment , he says
imagine @entity70 joining in to " @entity39 , as we pledge cooperation ... , " he says
@entity223 : @entity236 has come and gone for presidential entrances ; words remain unsung
