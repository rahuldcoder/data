-- for the billionaire who has everything , sometimes a superyacht just is n't enough -- that 's why the world 's wealthiest are buying " gigayachts			1
" these boats are the ultimate status symbol -- a sign of eminence , power and a seemingly limitless supply of cash			1
and when it comes to showing off wealth and status it seems the rule is " the bigger the better			1
" " there 's definitely a ' mine is bigger than yours ' syndrome in this industry and there is a desire to have the best			1
that 's the great thing about these yachts , " said @entity26 , ceo of @entity27 , one of the world 's leading yacht brokers			1
" when you get up to ' gigayacht ' status , it is all about the best and these people are used to having exceptional possessions around them all the time , " @entity26 continued			1
although the term " gigayacht " is not new , it is becoming increasingly prevalent as owners seek bigger and better yachts			2
" there is no standard definition of what a gigayacht is , " says @entity44 , editor of @entity45			0
" a gigayacht i would say is anything that is over 220 feet ( 67 meters ) where the majority of the yacht is customized and bespoke			1
" their owners are part of a small but illustrious set that includes @entity60 oligarchs , @entity62 royalty and international business tycoons			0
@entity65 's super rich eye superyachts the yacht to beat is currently @entity68 's " @entity67			1
" the largest private yacht in the world at 163 meters long , " @entity67 " is believed to feature around 24 guest cabins , two swimming pools and a mini-submarine , and was rumored to have cost between $ 540 million and $ 1.1 billion			1
although not all gigayachts come with that pricetag , @entity44 says the standard measure is around â ‚ ¬ 1 million ( $ 1.36 million ) per meter of length			2
" that works to a certain extent , but you also have to take into consideration which yard it is made in and the bespoke details involved , " he said			0
while that pricing means gigayachts are strictly for the super rich , you get a lot of bang for your bucks , @entity26 explained : " there is nothing standard when it comes to this area of our market			1
but if you are purchasing a superyacht you would want a vessel that was transglobal and you 'd want a reasonable speed			0
" you 'd probably want at least two helicopter platforms , so you can land your own helicopter and visitors can also land theirs , cinemas , hospitals , spas , large entertainments areas and hairdressing salons			0
" these vessels have anything from 80 to 120 people onboard including the crew , so it 's a little town			1
" @entity113 sails on $ 850,000 - a - week superyacht controlled by @entity115 but it 's not all about status			1
the trend towards bigger yachts is due in part to new technological advances in the yachting industry as well as the changing lifestyles of gigayacht owners , says @entity125			2
" going back to when i first started in the business , yachting used to be a form of camping almost , " he said			0
" nowadays , people are moving aboard their yachts and using them as a second home			2
" instead of going for one or two weeks , people will move onboard for the whole summer , " he said			0
the world 's second - largest gigayacht , the " @entity136 , " is a perfect example of this , says @entity44			1
owned by @entity139 , the ruler of the @entity136 and prime minister of the @entity141 , the " @entity136 " is a working boat as well as a holiday yacht			0
" there is room onboard for all of the crew , but there are also 20 - 30 cabins for clerical and support staff that you need when you 're running your business from onboard , " said @entity44			0
but the financial crisis means even gigayacht owners are having to spend smarter , says @entity26			2
" we 've got a whole new market landscape			0
no one 's looking to pay a strong price for a yacht , as they were pre- 2008 , " he said			2
" then it did n't matter how much you paid , it was cool to pay top price , now it matters a lot			0
in today 's market it is cool to be paying a low price			0
" but , says @entity26 , this does n't mean superyacht owners are going to scrimp on luxury			2
" oh no , they want it all , " he said			0
" there is no compromise , except on the price			0

gigayachts are viewed by some as the ultimate status symbol
