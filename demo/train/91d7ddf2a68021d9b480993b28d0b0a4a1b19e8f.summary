how can you not love @entity1 ? home of @entity3 , divine dim sum , lofty buildings , loftier real estate prices and -- in spite of all those buildings -- easy access to incredible stretches of great outdoors			1
it 's been more than 15 years since the @entity13 handed @entity1 over to @entity15 rule but little has changed			1
@entity1 remains a competitive and independent city , consistently ranked as one of the world 's best places to live			1
but do n't take our word for it			0
here are 10 things this great city does better than anywhere else			2
tonal talents native @entity28 speakers who 've managed to learn @entity29 from scratch : give yourselves a pat on the back			0
the language has a total of six to nine tones , depending on where you 're hearing it , compared to @entity28 's zero tones			0
no other @entity41 language comes close			0
( there are four tones in @entity44 , five in @entity45 and six in @entity47 )			0
that 's kind of like saying one @entity28 word can be pronounced six different ways and have at least six different meanings			0
locals like to say this makes us particularly good at music ( certain karaoke sessions have proven otherwise ) and studies have shown there 's some truth to this			0
to add to the complexity -- and fun -- of the language , @entity29 is a dialect with new slang invented everyday and many words are n't used in written communication			0
intimidated ? check out @entity70 's @entity69 channel , the @entity72 's most entertaining cantonese language teacher , for quick and easy @entity29 lessons			0
staying alive do n't wan na get murdered ? come to @entity1 ! the city not only has one of the lowest crime rates in the world , it ranks third in a list compiled by the @entity79 in 2011 of places with the least homicides			1
@entity1 -- with an intentional homicide rate of 0.2 per 100,000 people in the last 16 years -- only lost out to @entity84 and @entity85 , where there have been zero recorded murders			1
when you consider that @entity1 has a population of more than 7 million crammed into a city of 1,104 square kilometers , while @entity84 only has about 36,000 people and idyllic island nation @entity85 about 20,000 , @entity1 definitely triumphs as the safest city in the world			1
getting you there @entity1 is really good at getting you where you need to go			2
the public transportation system is famous around the world for its efficiency and profitability , making @entity1 one of the least car - dependent cities , with only about 710,000 registered vehicles			1
in particular , the @entity105 that operates @entity1 's subway system is so good at what they do they run other city 's trains as well , including operating sections of subway lines in @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and the whole of @entity119 and @entity120 's underground networks			1
building into the sky when you 've got a heck of a lot of people and very little land , what do you do ? @entity1 's solution is to stack them up on top of each other , inside tall buildings			1
once the city started doing it , it could n't stop			0
@entity1 now has 1,251 skyscrapers and high - rises , the most in the world , creating a dramatic skyline			1
there 's the bamboo - like @entity139 by renowned architect @entity141 and the 490 - meter @entity142 ( @entity1 's tallest ) , the latter of which will become a gigantic art piece at the hands of sound artist @entity147 during @entity148 @entity1 2014			1
daredevil construction most of those skyscrapers were built using bamboo scaffolding , an old craft that involves tying long pieces of sturdy bamboo together to form a freestanding grid structure for workmen to hang out on			0
daredevil scaffolders dangling precariously on bits of bamboo suspended in midair , with a small harness for support , are a common and heart - stopping sight in @entity1 's streets			1
while most other cities are using steel and aluminium scaffolding , @entity1 stands by bamboo , even establishing a licensing system through the @entity172			2
there are now more than 1,700 bamboo scaffolders registered with the @entity175			0
letting you keep your money as a financial center that 's historically been seen as the gateway to the @entity15 market , @entity1 is a great place to make money			1
what truly sets it apart is that residents actually get to keep most of the money they earn			0
with one of the lowest salaries tax rates in the world , capped at 15 - 17 % and no sales tax or @entity189 , @entity1 is an attractive place to work and play			1
the profits tax rate is the same for foreign and local companies at a low 16.5 % and there 's no capital gains tax in @entity1			1
that does n't make the local government a charity case though			0
property and shares trade keep the government flush -- financial secretary @entity200 estimates an hk $ 12 billion surplus for this year			0
editor 's note : an earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the salaries tax rate			2
the error has been corrected			0
@entity209 movies @entity3 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 ... the list of @entity1 's cinematic heavy hitters goes on			1
for a relatively small city ( population 7 million ) tucked away in a far corner of @entity220 , @entity1 sure has produced a lot of @entity223 - worthy stars			1
but it 's the city 's kung fu movies that are the most recognized			1
" @entity226 , " " @entity227 , " " @entity231 , " and " @entity232 " are just a few of the classics that come to mind			0
much of the city 's cinematic martial arts glory is due to the efforts of one legendary movie mogul : sir @entity237 , who passed away at the age of 107 in january			1
@entity237 put @entity1 movies on the map by inventing and popularizing kung fu genre films in the 1970s and pushing co-productions such as " @entity243			1
" despite all that clout @entity237 never got to work with @entity3 , as the kung fu superstar was offered a better deal by rival @entity247 early in his career			2

soft landings one of the most impressive sites for @entity1 visitors is the airport			2
most love the efficiency , the fast connection to the city through the @entity259 , and the frequent traveler system that allows jet setters to use a fast lane through immigration			0
the airport is one of the most lauded in the world , winning nearly 40 awards from international operations since it opened in 1998 and ranking atop @entity273 's @entity272 's @entity271 list for eight years in a row			2
sure , it 's recently been toppled from the throne by @entity278 's @entity277			0
but @entity1 handles more passenger traffic , 53 million passengers in 2011			2
foodie - ism @entity1 : 7 million people , 15,000 restaurants			1
this is a city of unashamedly camera - toting , food - blogging , lip - smacking gourmands			2
and while we do n't have the restaurant density of @entity292 , our diversity is staggering			0
foodies here will have lunch at a three @entity297 star restaurant and dinner at a street - side dai pai dong hawker stall			0
our cha chaan teng diners can whip up fantastical @entity220 - meets - @entity302 dishes , considered sacrilegious anywhere else in the world -- ever tried a syrup - slathered @entity306 toast filled with satay beef slices ? or instant noodles dressed in a cheese sauce ? no ? you have n't lived			2
take it from this city of people who are very good at eating			0
partying so hard the neighbors want in on it first time visitors to @entity1 's party area , @entity318 , might think they 've entered a time warp , suddenly appearing in @entity320 or @entity321 at 9 p.m. on a friday night			1
the area crams more than 100 bars , restaurants , clubs and shops into just a few short streets ( and in the high - rises along the streets ) , which themselves are nearly always crammed with expats , flight attendants and other 9 - to - 5 refugees			1
neon lights blur into happy hour signs , which blur into fridges filled with garishly colored vodka jelly shots			0
come special events , such as the @entity338 or @entity339 , the area gets ridiculously , lung - crushingly crowded			0
@entity341 claims it 's " @entity1 's premiere dining and entertainment destination , " which makes it sound somewhat more sophisticated than it really is			1
but for turning a rubbish tuesday workday into a heady , beery , feels - like - friday evening , where you 're guaranteed to meet someone you know , there 's no place like it			2
it 's so successful that @entity15 cities are asking @entity353 to re-create the nightlife districts in their cities , namely @entity356 and @entity357			0

movie mogul sir @entity237 is credited with putting @entity1 's martial arts movies on global *screens*
