-- @entity2 sen. @entity1 gets so into character playing @entity4 during debate prep that his performance four years ago sparring with then - @entity2 presidential candidate @entity7 made his wife , @entity8 , run out of the room crying			1
" part of your responsibility in these debates is to be tougher so the candidate you are helping is ready for the worst of it -- so you have to be mean			0
you need to get under their skin			0
sometimes the candidate you are working with does n't appreciate it , and even more often , their family does n't appreciate it , " @entity1 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			2
@entity1 is the @entity2 ' go - to sparring partner for mock presidential debates			1
since 2000 , he has played the roles of @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity4			2
5 things to watch in tonight 's debate @entity1 was careful not to discuss his current debate prep with @entity31 , since it is ongoing			1
still , he said he has never agreed to an interview about his recurring @entity35 role , until now			0
@entity1 said he spends hours reading , studying and watching everything he can get his hands on to best embody @entity35 and to prepare @entity2 for debates			1
though he declined to portray his @entity4 imitation , those who have seen it say it is uncanny			0
" he gets the style down , he gets the substance down , and he can really make you believe that he 's @entity4 , " said @entity43 , a @entity2 debate coach who has worked with @entity1 over the years			1
" he works very hard to understand every line of argument that the president might make and between those two characteristics , there is n't anyone better , " @entity43 said			0
@entity2 sources say @entity1 's no - holds - barred style has been especially important during his countless hours with the former @entity57 governor , since @entity31 sources admit one of his potential weak spots is becoming overly defensive , which can result in a gaffe			1
a @entity31 adviser tells @entity0 his mock debates with @entity1 have gotten so intense that they make a point to build in breaks for him to decompress with his family			1
inside @entity31 's mock debates , which began a month ago at a friend 's home in rural @entity72 , aides say they do their best to create what spokesman @entity73 calls " game - day conditions			1
" that means practicing the best way to talk policy , but also making sure the room is set to feel as close to the real thing as possible : two podiums and a moderator , played by longtime @entity31 adviser @entity83			1
members of @entity31 's inner circle , including @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , then dissect the answers and look for areas of improvement			1
in debates , presidential candidates ' tics and tells matter @entity43 says it 's impossible to underestimate the importance of the psychological aspect of debate prep			2
" there 's three things that you have to do to prepare a candidates : they have to know the policy material , they have to know the answers to the questions			0
the second thing is they have to know the strategy and how to execute it			0
but the third thing and probably the most important is they have to be mentally prepared			0
" it 's just like preparing an athlete , if they 're not mentally prepared for the worst of the worst then something will take them by surprise and so those mock debates are extremely important because i look at it like a batter in the on deck circle , they swing a heavy bat or a bat with a weight on it so that when they get in the batter 's box the bat feels lighter , " @entity43 explained			1
part of the prep is not just what @entity31 says ; it 's how he acts and reacts			2
@entity1 remembers preparing to play @entity25 in mock debates with @entity137 during the 2000 campaign , and noticing that @entity25 got unusually physically close to his opponent , @entity139			1
so @entity1 , acting as @entity25 , invaded @entity137 's personal space during rehearsal			2
" governor @entity137 's reaction was , ' he is not going to do that , that is ridiculous , ' and sure enough in that last debate , which was the one we were prepping for , @entity25 did just that			0
i saw governor @entity137 smile			0
i wonder if he was smiling saying ' @entity151 , @entity1 was right ' or if he was just smiling at @entity25 , but he handled it well , " @entity1 recalled			0
@entity43 , who was brought into the @entity31 campaign after a few underwhelming debate performances during the @entity2 primaries , says the candidate is extremely responsive to critiques			1
@entity159 : debate all about trust for @entity31 " he is a great student of political debate			2
he works very hard at it , so i think that he is absolutely coachable			0
he was able to do things across the debates , change a strategy , that let him win a majority of these debates , " @entity43 said			0
@entity43 considers the @entity0 debate in @entity170 , @entity171 , one of @entity31 's great debate moments -- when @entity174 refused to criticize @entity31 about lacking transparency as the former speaker had so often done on the campaign trail			1
@entity31 jumped in and asked , " would n't it be nice if people did n't make accusations somewhere else that they are n't willing to defend here ? " " it took @entity184 's argument and showed the absurdity in one line , " @entity43 said			1
" it created a moment in the debate where through one line , he could capture the imagination of the press , capture the imagination of the audience , and make a point -- make a strong point that crystallized that entire debate in one line , and that 's what governor @entity31 has to be looking for now , " @entity43 said			1
@entity2 sources say @entity31 has been working up a few one liners to get his points across , but @entity43 also said he hoped the @entity31 campaign is n't also practicing " zingers " as the @entity203 reported over the weekend			2
" it 's not about zingers , " @entity43 said			0
" a zinger might be just something funny , a comedic line , something to sort of break the monotony of the debate to try and capture the imagination , " he said			0
" it 's something that 's sort of shoehorned into the debate			0
" but a good line , @entity214 's line about his opponent 's youth and age , not making that an issue , a good line is a substantive line that does capture the imagination of the press and the audience , to overrun and deliver the message that you want and do it at the expense of your opponent			0
" @entity229 : ' @entity230 ' is always with @entity31 at the debates			2

@entity1 has portrayed @entity4 in @entity31 's debate preparations
@entity236 senator has acted as @entity35 candidate in mock debates since 2000
" he can really make you believe he 's @entity4 , " @entity2 debate coach says
@entity31 adviser says mock debates are so intense , they had to build in time to decompress
