-- growing up in the @entity3 - era @entity2 , we saw firsthand the great disparities in health care suffered by african - americans			1
the lack of access to basic services , the dearth of black physicians and the often overtly racist attitudes of white health care providers contributed to higher rates of infant mortality , chronic illnesses and shorter life expectancy			1
the rev. @entity18 , said that " of all forms of inequality , injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane			1
" but has n't the prejudice that prevailed in those far off times been eliminated in today 's more equitable society ? or do health disparities persist in less obvious but no less worrying ways -- and not just for african - americans ? studies emphatically conclude that such disparities do persist			2
@entity32 news and @entity33 released its latest issue announcing the best hospitals in the nation on tuesday			2
people put a lot of stock in these rankings , and equality of treatment should be considered as a factor in what makes a hospital excellent			2
" @entity51 , " published by the @entity52 in 2002 , spelled out exactly how @entity45 , african - americans , native - americans , @entity47 , and @entity48 receive care that 's inferior to that enjoyed by mainstream @entity32			2
the @entity52 report triggered other studies that demonstrated the ( often unconscious ) prejudice that prevails in treating women , the elderly , the lgbt community , the obese -- 13 groups in all -- a large percentage of the health care consuming public			1
here are a few shocking examples : women with symptoms of heart disease often are not transported by emergency medical services to health facilities as rapidly as men			2
women and blacks with heart attack symptoms are not given cardiac catheterizations and other appropriate clinical tests at the same rate as white men			0
latinos and african - americans do not receive the same pain medication for long bone fractures as do their fellow citizens			0
attacking health disparities head - on can make a big difference			0
a program in @entity82 designed to train dental health care therapists -- the rough equivalent of physician 's assistants -- celebrated its 10th anniversary this month			1
the @entity88 initiated the program , @entity90 , because the state had few dentists and most would n't accept @entity93			0
many native children lost all of their teeth by age 18 , affecting their health , social lives , school attendance , and employment possibilities			0
the dental health aide therapists have improved oral health in @entity82 dramatically			0
now , despite the fierce opposition of the @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 have approved the training and deployment of similar mid-level dental providers , and other states are considering it			0
it is widely accepted that african - americans and @entity114 are underserved			0
shortening the waiting times at @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 -- which primarily serves @entity119 , @entity114 and other minority populations -- allowed greater access to mental health services because the population is admitted more quickly and provided with care			1
hospitals would be encouraged to join the fight if equality were included as a metric in the @entity130 rankings			1
these rankings are popular and closely watched			0
they bestow bragging rights on hospitals , but most important , provide guidance for people deeply interested in where they might go to receive the best care in the specialties that concern them most			0
@entity32 news and @entity33 has a tremendous opportunity to facilitate significant changes in health care delivery by rating hospitals for their care of the underserved			1
its annual hospital rankings tell consumers nothing on this vital subject			0
where do hospitals rank in their understanding of the problem of unequal care ? what measures do they take to counteract the effects of prejudice in the treatment they provide ? we encourage the publication to maximize this opportunity before next year 's " @entity166 " issue			1
that would enable women and minorities to advocate for health care equality more successfully			1
it would help @entity32 health professionals understand health disparities and more effectively treat underserved and minority populations			1
most important , it would help all patients and their families , not just those who need not worry about disparities in care , to know better where to go for the care they need .			0
