-- last month , a delegation of members from the @entity4 @entity3 , which i was honored to lead , met with inspiring women of @entity8 who are helping to change the world			1
in @entity10 , @entity11 ; @entity13 , @entity14 ; and @entity15 , @entity16 , we held discussions with women who are committed to ensuring that women have a seat at the table and are able to succeed in this rapidly changing and strategically important region			2
it is an uphill climb , but there is no better time than the present			0
the women we met were outspoken in their belief that the new governments must be truly democratic , and that longstanding biases against full participation by women in their society must be abolished			1
these women came from many different backgrounds and viewpoints , yet they are aware that while their moment is now , the obstacles are great			2
some had participated in the massive @entity40 demonstrations that challenged decades of autocratic rule			1
others had studied in the @entity4 and other countries and then returned to build a future where women 's voices are equal to those of men			1
some are already serving in government but spoke about a need for more women to serve and to lead in forming new democracies in the @entity54			1
one message came through clearly in every discussion : they look to the @entity4 as an essential partner in their efforts to build democratic societies			1
women journalists played a crucial role in the overthrow of @entity11 president @entity65			1
women are already deeply involved in rebuilding the political and economic systems of their country			2
although just 10 of more than 500 members of the new parliament are women , the signal we received is that @entity11 women are committed to expanding their influence and their ranks , and to ensuring that the constitution under development will fully protect the rights of women in @entity11			2
similarly in @entity14 , deputy speaker @entity82 pledged to lead the effort for women 's rights and secular law in her nation			0
women already hold 26 % of the seats in the @entity89 , which is responsible for drafting @entity14 's @entity90			0
the determination of @entity14 women has been demonstrated outside the legislative chambers as well			0
in the midst of unrest at the @entity96 , a young woman watched outraged as a zealot tore down her country 's flag , and she then courageously climbed the flagpole to restore the flag to its rightful place , winning the plaudits of her countrymen			0
fundamental to opening opportunities to women in public and private life is expanding their access to education			1
the young women with whom we met in @entity15 were unanimous in their belief that improving the quality of education for all @entity16 is essential to the success of their revolution and the modernization of their country , particularly in light of the utter failure of the nation 's secondary schools and universities under @entity127			1
what i heard from the women of @entity8 was a refrain i have also heard in @entity132 and @entity133 and throughout the @entity54 : women and young people are weary of war			0
they are fed up with leaders who use ideology , religion and war to distract from the real challenges to peace , prosperity and democracy : a lack of education , a failure to provide jobs and economic opportunity , and the subjugation of women			1
they employed social media such as @entity154 and @entity155 to circumvent the repression imposed for decades by autocratic regimes and demonstrated astonishing bravery to liberate their countries from tyranny			0
they have succeeded in that first phase : @entity127 , @entity65 and @entity14 's @entity165 @entity164 are gone			0
these young women are under no illusions about the challenges they face			0
they are deeply committed to building democratic societies , and they are looking to us			0
we can not fail them			0
leaders throughout @entity8 and the @entity54 must honor the role women played in freeing their countries : all their citizens -- including women -- have important contributions to make at this historic moment			0
that is a lesson it has taken the @entity4 many generations to learn , but it is surely one of the most important pieces of wisdom we can share with developing democracies around the world			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity190 led delegation to meet with @entity194 women working for democracy
she says women want long - denied participation in society , access to education , jobs
@entity190 : many women were key players in @entity40 and do *n't* want to be left behind
@entity190 : they say @entity4 support is crucial for building democracies with roles for women
