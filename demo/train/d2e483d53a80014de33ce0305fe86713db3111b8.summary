-- as the world struggles to come to terms with the horror of another passenger jet falling from the skies , the full picture of how and why @entity2 17 came down over eastern @entity3 is far from clear			1
the @entity9 believes a surface - to - air missile brought the @entity11 down over territory held by pro-russian separatists but has n't indicated who 's responsible -- though both sides in the ongoing civil conflict in @entity3 blame each other			1
according to a top @entity3 official , the airliner , which was en route to @entity21 from @entity22 with nearly 300 people on board , was flying at about 10,000 meters ( nearly 33,000 feet ) over the @entity26 region of eastern @entity3 when the missile hit			1
a number of airlines have since re-routed services away from the region , prompting questions about whether commercial aircraft should be anywhere near conflict zones anyway			1
" was this an accident waiting to happen for any airliner flying over that part of the @entity3 -- and there were plenty of them ? " asked @entity0 aviation expert @entity36			1
" although there had been restrictions over @entity47 , in this part of @entity3 there are no restrictions			1
the space between the ground and 32,000 feet had been closed by the @entity3			1
above 32,000 feet it was open			2
this plane was not doing anything wrong being where it was			2
" we can argue whether restrictions should have been in place with everything going on there , but when that pilot flew that route ... there was nothing wrong with doing so			1
" " that part of @entity3 is essentially ungoverned space , and when you have ungoverned space you have these kinds of calamities , " said retired @entity66 major general and @entity0 military analyst @entity67			1
" sadly , we should not be surprised by this			2
" @entity76 weapon " we do n't know who had their finger on the trigger , but clearly this is @entity76 kit , whether in @entity3 hands or in @entity76 , " he added			1
analysts believe this " kit " could be a @entity85 missile system			1
known as the @entity85 among @entity88 forces , it was developed by the @entity89 and operated by both @entity76 and @entity3 forces , according to retired @entity91			1
gen. @entity92 , director of the @entity93 at the @entity94 at @entity95			0
as to where the order came from , @entity96 suggested air defense units could be operating without central control			1
" it could be an independent process , " he said			0
" that means individual operators of that launcher or mobile air defense system can engage targets at will based on certain profiles -- they see an aircraft , its altitude , it does n't transpond in a way they can figure out , so their initial reading is that it 's military and they fire because they have the authority			2
what you 'd prefer to have is some back - up systems , but that was clearly not the case here			2
" investigation worry with much of the wreckage believed to be in territory held by separatists near the @entity76 border , there 's concern that international inspectors may not be granted access to conduct a proper investigation before the crash site is " contaminated " or tampered with			1
" ultimately , the international community is going to demand that there is a proper , full investigation , " said @entity36			2
@entity137 , a reporter with the @entity138 , told @entity0 it was important to bring in a skilled investigator to look for clues in the wreckage			0
" what you look for in a ' shoot down ' or explosion is the condition of the metal			0
are there shrapnel holes ? are their entry wounds and exit wounds -- something that went through the airframe ? are there bends in the metal characteristic of high explosives ? if someone skilled can find it , they 'll be able to make a diagnosis			0
" cockpit clue he said the aircraft 's cockpit voice recorder could also provide vital clues if they survived a possible blast			0
" you might catch conversations between the crew			0
this has happened before in airplanes that were shot down , where it 's clear pilots were talking to each other about damage to the plane			0
they know what 's happened and that would makes things clearer , " said @entity137			0
" there 's no reason why we should n't get the recorders , " added @entity184			0
" yes , there was a very violent fire and a very violent crash , but this thing is designed for this			2
" yet it 's by no means certain that outside assistance will be permitted inside such a volatile area			0
however , @entity137 says that there is a precedent for data recovery			0
" when the @entity89 shot down @entity200 ( in 1983 ) ... they said they 'd recovered nothing			0
" the father of a young college student was on that plane			0
@entity205 went to @entity206 , went to ( president ) @entity208 and brought back the black box -- and that cockpit voice recorder told a lot			2
" the friends and relatives of @entity214 will be hoping they will be spared the anguish of not knowing too .			0
