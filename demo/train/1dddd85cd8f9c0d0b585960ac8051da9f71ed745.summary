-- there 's no " authentic " way to be black , president @entity1 told a group			1
for once , i agree with the president			1
speaking at a town hall event this week about his " @entity10 " initiative , the president gave blacks permission to be individuals , rejecting the idiotic notion that speaking proper @entity15 and being successful in life is " acting white			1
" as if any person of any race with two grains of sense would think this is logical			0
during the event , @entity1 was asked by a young @entity24 man , " how is the @entity26 government helping @entity28 people revitalize their language and culture ? " @entity1 responded : " what 's great about @entity26 is the way that we all take these different cultures and we make one culture out of it			1
" @entity1 said that it is important for @entity26 to know their roots and where they come from , but not be held hostage by our cultures from advancing in life			1
then , @entity1 got real			1
he talked about how black @entity26 use this " group think " psychology to bully other blacks , keep them from expressing themselves as individuals and stop them from assimilating into the broader culture of @entity26			1
" sometimes african - americans , in communities where i 've worked , there 's been the notion of ' acting white ' -- which sometimes is overstated , " he told the group			1
" but there 's an element of truth to it , where , ok , if boys are reading too much , then , well , why are you doing that ? or why are you speaking so properly ? and the notion that there 's some authentic way of being black , that if you 're going to be black you have to act a certain way and wear a certain kind of clothes , that has to go			1
there are many different ways for @entity70 men to be authentic			1
" he went on to use his wife , first lady @entity72 , as an example			0
" if you look at @entity72 , she grew up @entity75			0
and her mom still lives in a neighborhood where gunshots go off , and it can be rough where @entity72 grew up			0
but she 'll talk proper when she needs to			0
now , you also do n't want to get on her wrong side , because she can translate that into a different vernacular			0
but my point is , is that you do n't have to act a certain way to be authentic			0
" i rolled my eyes in disgust , remembering all the times in my life that phrase has been hurled at me from other blacks			2
growing up , i was n't raised in a home where we " talked or acted black " -- speaking broken @entity15 , neck jerking and behaving like the black stereotypes we see in some of the @entity98 movies			1
so , i was shocked to encounter such nonsense when i attended @entity100 as an undergraduate			0
most of the black students -- who generally all hung out in the same pack , eating , studying and socializing exclusively together -- informed me i was an " @entity106 , " not really black because i chose to have an integrated experience at @entity100			2
one of the biggest sins i committed was refusing to eat at the all - black cafeteria tables in the various dorms			2
i would wonder , if you only want to socialize with black students , then why not just attend a predominantly black college ? my freshman year , i went to a dance with a white guy from my class			1
when he came by my dorm room to pick me up , two black girls from across the hall stared and snickered , uttering something along the lines that i wanted to be white so bad			1
really ? the next day the same girls heckled me again about my date			0
tired of dealing with their stupidity , i walked over and told them i would continue to do whatever i wanted			2
instead of being so concerned with my life and who i was dating , they should be concerned with their own			0
i have never been counseled on how to act black			2
more recently , my blackness was questioned by @entity135 during an appearance on @entity0 last week			2
the two of us were discussing the illegal immigration crisis and @entity135 did n't like the argument i made			0
so she tried to insult me			0
" so what i 'm saying is , @entity141 , i mean i do n't know if you identify as @entity70			0
i do , but if you drop me off in @entity144 i could n't speak the language			0
" clearly , @entity135 missed the president 's memo			2
there is no litmus test for being black			1
join us on @entity152 / @entity151 .			0

@entity154 is tired of blacks putting down other blacks by saying they are " acting white "
