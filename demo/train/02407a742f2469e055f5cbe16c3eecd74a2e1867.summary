-- " homefront " tries to craft an expansive , historical " what if ? " scenario			1
but the new game ends up delivering " oh ... not again ! " game play			1
the first - person shooter from @entity7 and @entity8 expands on current tensions with @entity10 , but delves into a future where @entity12 unify and ultimately occupy the @entity13 in 2027			1
you play as @entity15 , a former pilot who is thrown in with a band of rebels intent on fighting to regain control of @entity13			1
the depiction of a brutalized and beaten - down @entity23 city is very well done			1
in the game , the @entity25 forces have erected a wall around the city and the remaining homes and businesses look as if they have been under siege for quite some time			1
it is hard to find an oasis in the bleak surroundings and the scene accurately portrays a sense of doom that plagues a nation after a wartime loss			2
but @entity39 remembers the old glory of the @entity13 and wants to do what it can to bring it back			1
game play is straightforward , first - person shooter action -- with a massive emphasis on shooting			1
there is very little stealth or strategy involved as the game progresses along a pretty strict linear path -- giving players few choices as they move from one virtual shooting gallery to the next			1
weapons are the automatic rifles , machine guns , sniper rifles , pistols and grenades that are typical for the genre			2
ammo is scarce early in the game but seems to become easier to find as the story moves forward			1
the characters who initially rescue @entity67 and assist him throughout the missions border on stereotypical , with very little personality other than what 's needed to move the game from point a to point @entity73 there is the strong but calm leader , who ends up getting killed during a cut scene			1
there is the overbearing foul - mouth who just wants to attack at nearly every chance			1
there is a female nonplayer character who is good at stealth and is really the only character who exhibits any emotion other than anger			0
and there is a character of @entity25 descent that is great at fixing the tech , but is the target of racial hatred			0
none of the characters really connect on any level			0
even when they die , it does n't really evoke any empathy from the player and just feels like another video - game casualty			1
the game is frequented by buggy movement and areas that load awkwardly			1
often , a scene will be completed and an opening will appear to move on , but instead of walking through , a nonplayer character will block your way for a minute or so before moving on			0
other characters will also appear to be having some sort of fit when standing around as they shake violently before progressing			0
it was really hard to feel immersed in the game play			1
while there were objectives to be met , there was no real sense of accomplishment in getting them done			0
in fact , there was one scene where i decided to see what would happen if i made @entity67 just stand off to the side			0
a nonplayer character completed the mission without my help			0
the story and the idea for an alternative future with a unified @entity10 as a world power had great potential			1
trying to retake @entity13 soil against overwhelming odds is rooted within our national dna and would have made a great tale for an fps / strategy - style game			1
in one scene , the resistance fighters crest a hill overlooking the town they are attempting to flee , only to see it in flames from @entity25 rockets and explosives			0
instead of exploring possible revenge or expressing remorse , the characters quickly gloss over it and head to the next shooting ground			0
it was that sort of repetition that brought the game down			2
individually , the pieces felt like they were there -- good action , nice story -- but without any sense of accomplishment or involvement , " homefront " stagnated , hampered by slow transitions and spotty animation			2
it also did n't help that the single - player campaign was over quickly ( six hours for me )			2
" homefront " also stirred up controversy with its choice of a real world opponent			2
the game has been banned in @entity25 and censored in @entity176 , removing all references to @entity10 and its leader , @entity178			1
on the positive side , the multiplayer action was better than the campaign because it took the elements that worked and added objectives that felt real when accomplished			0
ground - control mode and " team deathmatch " mode pit one side against the other , but there are bonuses and points that let you rack up new weapons and ablatives as the fighting is still ongoing			2
kill streaks can also gain players additional abilities , like increased weapon damage			0
there 's a twist , though			0
the longer your kill streak , the more likely you are to be targeted by enemy forces			0
players become " instigators " for completing mission elements and the opposite side can then use hunters to eliminate you			0
the more missions you complete , the more hunters can be assigned to find you and kill you			0
it makes the game feel alive in multiplayer action and it really does take teamwork to win			2
it is just too bad those qualities could n't transfer over to the single player			0
" homefront " is available on @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221			2
it is rated m for mature due to strong language , violence , and blood			0
this review was done on a retail copy for the @entity220 .			0
