there 's been plenty of talk of late -- welcome discussion , in my humble opinion -- about equal pay for equal work			1
@entity9 sparked an online conversation and debate with her call for pay equality after accepting the award for best supporting actress at this year 's @entity16			1
and , this month , the embattled and now ex- co-chairwoman of @entity18 , @entity19 , whipped up another firestorm by putting the onus on women			1
if women want to eliminate pay disparities in @entity26 , they need to demand more money			1
" what women have to do is not work for less money , " she said , according to @entity29			1
" they have to walk away			1
" that is certainly easier said than done for most women in @entity36 , who ca n't afford to turn their backs on their jobs when they are helping to support families or doing it all on their own			1
but there is something all women can do no matter their income level or background -- and it 's something that could dramatically alter the course of their lives , according to bestselling new book " @entity50			1
" author @entity51 -- a motivational speaker , lawyer and former @entity54 reporter who has more energy pulsing from her petite frame than most of us could ever imagine -- says that before any woman can push for a raise or a promotion , she 's got to put her attention on one and only one person : herself			1
" you 've got to love you , " @entity62 said during a recent visit to @entity1 's studios			1
" you 've got to like you , and so many of us in the 21st century do not as women like and value ourselves			1
" it may sound too simplistic to you or more psychobabble than actionable advice , but think about it			1
why have books like " @entity73 , " about how women lack the same confidence as men , struck such a chord ; or ads such as # @entity79 , about how our girls lose confidence post-puberty , gone viral and been prominently featured during the @entity83 ? for a host of reasons , many women grow up not truly appreciating what we can do and what we can be , says @entity62 , whose book is broken down into 20 codes or keys that can help women " unlock " their true potential			1
code no. 1 , she says , is for women to know their own value , and we 're talking value beyond what they earn or believe they should earn			1
tip no. 1 : your past does not define you " so many women are defined by hurts that happened to them , the family they grew up in , " said @entity62 , " and they never really move past the definitions that their families gave them			1
" we 've got these tapes that we play in our heads , she says			2
so , if you were constantly told supportive things , such as " you can do anything , " which i heard at home and at school , that can push you to overcome challenges			2
if you were repeatedly told negative things , such as " you are too shy , not ambitious enough , not good enough , " those words can stay with you -- but only if you let them , says @entity62 , who frequently appears on television and radio as a political and cultural commentator			2
" if you were given negative tapes , you have to make peace with that , " she said			2
" and you have to decide i 'm not going to be defined by that			2
i 'm going to be the definer of me			2
and that 's what i really want women to get out of this			1
everything you need to win at life is inside of you			2
greatness is there , so it does n't matter how you start			2
it matters how you finish			2
tip no. 2 : teach people how to treat you another key to knowing your value , says @entity62 , is teaching people how to treat you			2
" if you do n't speak up for yourself , no one else ever will , " she said			2
" that code was hard for me because when somebody does something not nice to us ... we 're thinking , ' well , they 're a jerk , ' but guess what ? if you did n't raise your voice , if you did n't say that was n't acceptable , people are going to treat you any old way			1
" good advice , but not the easiest to execute , i said , especially when women who speak up are too often called the b - word or receive the " who does she think she is ? " reaction			1
" that 's exactly true , " said @entity62			2
" however , if we want to shift it for your daughter , my nieces , the younger women coming up , then that means we have to do a culture shift			1
and part of living by a code and knowing your value and teaching people how to treat you is you establish a boundary			0
" you are not a ' b ' because you say ' that was n't polite ' or ' i did n't like it ' ; you are asserting yourself			0
men do it all the time			0
and i think when we teach our sons and our nephews and the men in our lives that it 's ok for us to assert ourselves ... we 're being a human being			0
we are saying what we do n't like			0
we have to make it ok for women and girls to speak up			1
" tip no. 3 : being accountable for yourself we are too often taught to put everyone else before us , says @entity62 : kids , husband , partner , job , you name it			0
@entity213 , for one , am guilty of that , and i bet many of you reading this are in the same category			0
but we end up not only hurting ourselves by this approach ; we hurt everything around us as well			0
" when you are accountable for you , you say if i 'm a happy me , if i 'm making good choices , if i 'm taking care of me , everybody else is going to benefit from that			0
" tip no. 4 : guarding your heart being accountable for you and taking care of your needs does n't mean you become your own island			0
it means you find a way to put your priorities near the top of the list			0
it also means you guard your own heart , says @entity62			0
" guarding your heart does n't mean gating your heart , " she said			0
" it means when you get hurt , you 're resilient			0
it means you choose the right people , not the wrong people			0
and when you come across the wrong people , you honor you and say , ' now , wait a minute			0
' " it means letting go of the toxic personal and professional relationships and knowing when it 's time to move on from a job , make a career change or choose a new personal path			0
" everything you need to win is inside you			0
you just got to push it out			0
" i do n't really believe in @entity254 's resolutions but i did start 2015 with a motto : let 's do this thing			0
it means seize the moment , go for what you want , take chances , take risks			0
i was reminded of that as i read " @entity50			0
" let 's do this thing , women			1
let 's do it now			0
do you feel the issue of " knowing your value " has ever held you back in your personal or professional lives ? share your thoughts with @entity273 on @entity274 or @entity275 on @entity276 .			1
