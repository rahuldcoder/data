-- for some time now , @entity2 hawks like sen. @entity3 and rep. @entity4 have been saying that our military budget is inadequate for the threats we face			1
they like to gripe that president @entity9 is orchestrating the decline of @entity12 power			1
some of this is pure partisanship			0
@entity2 criticize @entity15 just as @entity15 criticized president @entity16			0
the hawks , though , have a special devotion to the military budget			2
in their view , some military spending is good ; more is even better			0
but if overspending on the military and promoting the @entity12 as global policeman are benchmarks of approval , they should have little to complain about with our current president			1
contrary to his rhetoric of change , the president sounded like a neoconservative when he declared during his recent @entity34 address that the @entity12 was , and would remain , the world 's " indispensable nation			1
" @entity9 's proposed @entity38 budget , released last week , affirmed his intention to retain most of the @entity12 military 's current missions , even when they are n't needed to safeguard the @entity12 ' vital security interests			1
meanwhile , the @entity38 's latest strategy document was carefully designed to convince allies and adversaries alike that the @entity12 can continue to prosecute multiple armed conflicts in far - flung corners of the globe			1
taken together , @entity9 's strategy document , budget and @entity34 remarks articulate a coherent philosophy on military spending and global engagement that ought to hold a lot of appeal for the neoconservatives in the @entity2			1
but partisan politics aside , what our foreign policy leaders have consistently ignored is an argument that should have strong sway at a time of economic uncertainty : this country 's tax dollars can be better spent than on defending wealthy allies who are more than capable of protecting themselves			1
the administration plans to withdraw some @entity12 troops from @entity74 , but as many as 70,000 are likely to remain			2
meanwhile , the number of troops in @entity77 will be increased			0
these troops serve to reassure our allies of our commitment to defend them			0
it is working as designed : other countries do not spend enough to satisfy their defense needs			2
the end result is that @entity12 pay more			2
the @entity9 administration 's budget will cost every @entity12 nearly $ 2,000 next year			1
the figure rises by hundreds of dollars when one accounts for homeland security , payments to veterans , and the few billion dollars tucked away in the @entity92 for the nation 's bloated nuclear arsenal			2
all told , every @entity12 will likely shell out more than $ 2,700 on spending classified as national defense			1
that is at least 2Â½ times what the @entity98 spend , five times more than what the @entity101 spend , and six times what the @entity104 spend			0
it is hard to see how that is good news for @entity12 struggling to make ends meet			2
@entity9 's magnanimity is especially ironic given his emphasis on " fairness " and " shared sacrifice			1
" his rhetoric apparently does not apply to people living outside the @entity12			2
@entity12 troops will continue to be tasked with policing the world , and @entity12 taxpayers will be on the hook to pay for it			0
the administration has proposed to restrain the growth of military spending			0
but total @entity12 military spending will remain well above pre- 9/11 levels			1
the @entity9 administration is requesting $ 525 billion for the @entity38 's base budget in 2013 , plus another $ 88.4 billion to pay for the war in @entity129			1
to put this in perspective , that is more than the annual average during @entity135 's time in office ( about $ 526 billion in today 's dollars )			0
one seldom hears @entity2 hawks speak of @entity135 as a misguided dove who left the country vulnerable to attack			0
focusing only on budget numbers , however , misses the big picture			0
instead , we must focus on what we will spend and why			0
the answer is clear : our military budget is large by historical standards because @entity150 is unwilling to revisit the premise that @entity12 are responsible for everything that happens in the world , even things that have no connection to @entity12 security or prosperity			1
our fiscal crisis has created an opportunity to revisit our commitments abroad			0
we should focus @entity12 power on our core interests , and call on other countries to take responsibility for their own defense			1
intuitively , that exercise should satisfy both liberal demands that " everyone pay their fair share " and conservative demands that our government " live within its means			0
" but given the rhetoric we have heard so far , it is doubtful that this election cycle will produce a leader who will seriously contemplate how we can most prudently provide for our common defense			0
