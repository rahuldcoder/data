if you start over in @entity41 on the @entity42 , you go to @entity43 in the @entity27 , then down the @entity44			2
there was damage across parts of that entire area			2
three states -- @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 -- seemed to get the worst of this			2
and besides the physical damage , hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed over the past couple days			2
@entity57 wraps up some of the impact of these storms			1
( begin video ) @entity61 : it 's that rare of an event			1
@entity57 , @entity0 anchor : everyone has a storm they 'll talk about for the rest of their lives			2
for many folks from the @entity73 down through the south , this was it , their hurricane , their nor'easter			2
it even had a name : the " chi - clone			2
" @entity80 : it sounds just like a train , like they say it does			2
and as fast as it came is as fast as it went			2
@entity87 : a historic storm stretching a staggering 1,200 miles from north to south that had it all : hurricane - force winds , monsoon - like rain , blizzard warnings and tornadoes reported in at least seven states			2
this surveillance camera kept rolling inside one possible twister in @entity50 as the tin roof came off a barn and a boat went airborne			2
trees snapped and crushed cars in @entity52			2
a rogue gust of wind tipped over a semi and tore off its roof in @entity107			2

and i said , " yeah , right			2
" @entity87 : now , the dangerous storm is moving on			2
but thousands of fliers are n't , as grounded airlines struggle to catch up			2
@entity80 : we have to leave today			1
( @entity124 ) @entity125 @entity28 : a health official says it could take months to get an outbreak of cholera under control in @entity4			2
cholera is a disease that 's caused by a bacterial infection			1
most people get it from contaminated food or water			2

right now , the outbreak is getting worse			0
more than 4,000 people have confirmed cases of the disease			0
nearly 300 others have died so far			0
aid workers are trying to slow down the spread of cholera by going into @entity4 camps and teaching people about proper water and waste treatment			0
many @entity4 are living in these camps because their homes were destroyed by the earthquake earlier this year			0
what 's the word @entity157 , @entity14 : what 's the @entity156 ? any kind of animal that has a backbone @entity162 that 's the word ! endangered vertebrates @entity28 : when we talk about vertebrates , it includes mammals , birds , amphibians			1

amphibians like this frog are in the most danger			1
according to the @entity172 , over 40 percent of them are closer to extinction than we thought			1
scientists say habitat loss is partly to blame here			0
when land changes --- cutting down trees , for example -- animals that lived there might not be able to survive			0
there is some good news in the report , though			1
experts say that the situation could have been worse if it were n't for conservation efforts to save some of these species			0

and one expert says parents need to be part of this situation by talking to their kids and looking for signs of bullying			0
