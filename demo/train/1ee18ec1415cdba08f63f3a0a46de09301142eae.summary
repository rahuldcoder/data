-- @entity2 co-founder @entity1 , known to many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax dodger than as an actual person , has finally spoken out			1
in an interview with a magazine in his family 's native @entity9 , @entity12 -- a newly minted billionaire after @entity2 's public stock offering -- talked about his taxes , his relationship with co-founder @entity17 and life after " @entity19			1
" many observers believe @entity1 , who , according to the @entity2 origin story was slighted by @entity17 as the site grew , was a primary source for the book " @entity25 , " on which " @entity19 " is based			1
surprise : the @entity27 hates rich people but the end result was " fantasy , " he said			0
and , no , he never angrily threw a laptop at @entity17 as his @entity34 counterpart , @entity33 , did in the film			0
it 's a statement @entity37 , of magazine @entity38 , writes is instantly believable given @entity1 's reserved nature			1
" that 's @entity34 , not a documentary , " the 30 - year - old @entity1 says in the interview conducted in his multimillion - dollar residence in @entity42			2
@entity1 filed a lawsuit against @entity2 over his reduced stake in the company , and the legal dispute was settled out of court			1
but despite well - documented friction over the years , @entity1 says he bears no ill will toward @entity17			1
" i can only speak well of @entity17 ; i do n't resent him , " @entity1 said			2
" his focus from @entity53 until today is admirable			0
he was a visionary and always knew @entity2 would only grow if it remained true to its central idea of people presenting themselves truthfully and without pseudonyms			2
" that is the great power of @entity2 that allowed it to transform into an instrument of protest , as in @entity60 , but also as an instrument of business and , beyond that , a natural way to have contact with friends			0
" @entity1 has had little to do with @entity2 in recent years			2
but he re-entered the public consciousness recently when , days before @entity2 stock was due to hit @entity69 , he renounced his @entity71 citizenship in favor of @entity42 , where he has lived since 2009			1
many saw it as a dodge -- a way to avoid paying @entity71 taxes on his share of the company , valued somewhere around $ 2 billion			1
he says that 's not the case and noted that , as has been reported , he 's paying his taxes			1
" the decision was strictly based on my interest of living and working in @entity42 , " he said			0
" i am obligated and i will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to the @entity71 government			0
i already paid and i will keep paying whatever taxes i owe based on my time as a @entity71 citizen			2
" @entity1 's father , @entity89 , echoed those thoughts in the article			0
" it was hard for me , because of the life i built in the @entity71 , hearing from @entity1 that he had to give up on his citizenship , " he said			1
" but he did this not because he wanted to , but because he had no other choice as a foreigner living in @entity42 , where financial transactions are more restricted and bureaucratic for those who hold a @entity71 passport			0
there was no other way			0
" @entity89 and his family emigrated to the @entity71 from @entity9 amid political turmoil , and @entity1 's registered place of birth is @entity108			1
@entity1 continues to work as an investor and partner in @entity27 startups from his @entity42 apartment , where an office contains three , 27 - inch @entity109 monitors on which he constantly monitors everything from stock prices to the weather , @entity37 writes			0
as for @entity2 itself ? @entity1 still has his own profile , with more than 1 million people subscribed to it			2
but he uses it almost exclusively for news about his new startups , keeping the personal details to himself			0
" i do n't like showing my private life online , " he said .			0

@entity2 co-founder @entity1 opens up to @entity9 magazine
despite past friction between them , @entity130 calls @entity17 " a visionary "
he says that , despite renouncing citizenship , he 's paying taxes in @entity71
@entity1 made an *estimated* $ 2 billion from @entity2 's stock offering
