@entity0 -- a federal judge sentenced @entity3 to life without parole on tuesday for his role in the 1998 bombings of two @entity9 embassies in @entity10 , which left 224 people dead and thousands wounded			1
he is the first @entity14 detainee tried in @entity9 civilian court , having been convicted by a federal jury in november on a single conspiracy charge to destroy buildings and property at @entity9 embassies in @entity21 and @entity22			1
" finally , 12 1/2 years after those devastating and despicable attacks , @entity3 will pay for his crimes , " @entity9 attorney @entity23 told reporters			1
@entity3 was acquitted of the remaining 284 counts of conspiracy and terrorism - related charges , including conspiring to kill @entity9 and use weapons of mass destruction			1
he had faced a minimum of 20 years in prison , but instead received a life sentence			0
@entity3 , a 36 - year - old @entity22 , never took the stand			0
" today 's sentencing of @entity3 shows yet again the strength of the @entity9 justice system in holding terrorists accountable for their actions , " @entity9 attorney general @entity36 said in a written statement			1
the trial , considered a test for the @entity46 administration , which had maintained that it could try some terrorism suspects in civilian courts , coincides with both the president 's @entity51 address and reports of a possible increase in the use of military commissions			1
on the eve of the trial , @entity9 district judge @entity56 excluded testimony from a witness that prosecutors said could provide evidence of @entity3 's involvement in the bomb plot , after learning of the witness ' coerced interrogation at a @entity67 - run detention facility abroad			2
the move raised questions over future convictions in the war against @entity72 , widening the debate over the use of civilian courts for @entity14 detainees , including alleged september 11 mastermind @entity77			2
@entity3 was captured in @entity78 in 2004 after training with @entity72 leaders in the region , where the government says he became a bodyguard and cook for @entity84			0
for two years he was interrogated under the supervision of the @entity67 , raising questions of torture that defense attorneys later used as grounds to petition for leniency			0
@entity3 was then moved to the @entity9 naval base in @entity92 where he spent the next three years before being transferred into federal custody in @entity0 , according to court documents			1
throughout the trial , the defense portrayed @entity3 as a man with local knowledge of @entity22 who was exploited by @entity72 , arguing that his cumulative detention at secret facilities abroad and at @entity14 deprived him of a speedy trial			2
the government rejected the claim that he was duped into participating in planning the attack , pointing to evidence that @entity3 obtained gas tanks in @entity22 and noting his presence in @entity108 , @entity21 , with members of the bomb plot			0
but during court proceedings , jury members showed signs of division			0
@entity115 rejected a defense plea for a mistrial after a juror claimed to be chastised for disagreeing with fellow jurors , heightening prosecutor fears that @entity3 could elude conviction			0
the case also came against the background of @entity3 's detention as an " unlawful enemy combatant , " a murky classification surrounding the legality of holding terrorism suspects that the @entity46 administration has tried to distance itself from			1
but in the weeks after his november conviction , lawmakers passed legislation meant to prevent @entity134 funding from being used to transfer @entity14 detainees to @entity9 soil , stifling an administration pledge to allow more detainees to be tried in civilian courts			2
@entity1 's @entity140 and @entity141 contributed to this report			0
