why do you go to galleries ? is it because you like to keep up with what 's going on in the arts ? because a poster caught your eye ? because of something someone said on @entity9 ? or because you want to satisfy yourself that you 're cleverer than the latest " celebrity charlatan ? " @entity11 , one of @entity13 's leading contemporary artists , is under no illusion as to why people go to museums -- the first piece in his new show at the @entity19 is , he admits , " me getting my revenge in first			1
" the work , " @entity30 , " is a pot in the @entity28 - winning ceramicist 's distinctive style , covered in figures explaining the worthy , and not so worthy , motivations behind their visit to the show			1
cheeky , yes , and full of @entity11 's quirky sense of fun , but like the rest of the " @entity36 " exhibition , it is also a love letter to museums and galleries in general -- and to one in particular : the @entity19			1
crammed with more than eight million objects collected over the past 250 years , the museum 's stores are a vast repository of centuries of human history , and human achievement			1
over the past two years , @entity11 has been let loose inside what the museum 's boss @entity46 calls " one of the great imaginative storehouses of the world , " free to pick and choose items for his show from its immense collection			1
from that bewildering array , he has selected just under 200 items which inspired , amused and intrigued him -- from an earring with part of the wearer 's ear still attached , via religious artifacts , to cheap souvenir pin badges			2
he has paired them up with items from his own artistic past , and in many cases created whole new works suggested by the sparks they set off inside his brain			0
welcome , the artist says , to " a short tour through my head			0
" the @entity19 has been a place of pilgrimage for @entity11 since he was a child -- though he admits to a sense of disappointment on his first visit , because the model boats in the @entity83 collection were not as shiny and new as the cars he played with at home			1
" people come here and they stand outside and take photographs of themselves as proof - ' i was here , i made the pilgrimage , ' " he says			0
for him , the museum is a place that allows him to travel the world , just 20 minutes away from the comfort of his own home			0
" a lot of my world travel , i 've done in the @entity19 , " he explains			2
" i 've never been to @entity97 , i 've never been to @entity98 -- one of the pieces i made for the show is actually called " i 've never been to @entity98 " -- i make no bones about it , i am what i am			0
" the world is full of " experience junkies " who want to go around the world having an amazing time			0
i 'm not one of them , " he deadpans			0
at the heart of the exhibition is the eponymous " @entity115 , " a ship , sailing into the afterlife , bedecked with casts of some of the museum 's " celebrity artifacts " -- mummies , sculptures , busts , plaques -- " freighted , " @entity11 explains , " with the greatest hits of the @entity19			1
" and at the center of the centerpiece ? a humble flint axe			0
" the tool that begat all tools , " @entity11 says , describing the " incredibly powerful , visceral moment " when one of the museum 's curators handed him a box filled with ancient stone tools , and invited him to pick one up , cementing his links with the first craftsmen who created them			1
as @entity46 points out , @entity11 is not the first to find inspiration in the museum 's historic galleries -- but he has taken it further than anyone else			2
" throughout the museum 's history , artists have used the collection to inspire them , to make their own art , but until now , none of them has used it to make his own museum , his own civilization			2
" in doing so , @entity46 says , @entity11 has made everyone -- even those who work at the museum -- look at the objects differently			1
this is @entity11 's aim			2
he wants to inspire in his turn , just as he has been inspired			0
" i hope that when people leave , they want to make something , they want to look at the world afresh			0
