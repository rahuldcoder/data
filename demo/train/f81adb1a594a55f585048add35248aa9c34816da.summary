-- hands in pockets , a downward glance , tiger print glasses and @entity5 from head to toe			0
sounds like a fashion spread in a magazine , right ? except the model is a toddler from @entity12 , one of many whose notable outfit and saucy pose has inspired an audience online			1
shoulders - up school portraits , these are not			0
these kids wear labels and looks usually designated for adults , and they wear them with panache			1
some are more notable for the combination of clothes , for the slick lighting and scenery , or the oh - so - adult face they put forward for the camera			0
you 'd probably call it swagger			0
when kids have it , they essentially look like petite versions of models in a @entity39 ad : a cool air of confidence exuded for camera - wielding parents			1
but is that swagger because kids are more fashion savvy ? that the proud parents are just taking more photos ? or that fashion these days is more impressed by the sartorial choices of 3 - year - olds ? maybe a little bit of everything			1
@entity52 , a casting director by trade , runs " @entity54 , " a blog started in 2009 that catalogs the street fashion sense shown off by @entity59 's youngest residents , and the attitude that goes along with it			1
@entity62 started by taking photos of children she saw around her neighborhood that had something special -- a great haircut , a really unique outfit or really great energy			1
it 's a diverse , artistic community where the parents and kids have a high capacity for fashion , she said			1
" we never got a ' no ' from a parent , ever , " @entity52 said			0
" the kids in @entity59 dress better than the adults in most of the rest of the country , which is the truth			1
" but it turns out that the young and stylish are everywhere			0
" we were getting e-mails from people all over the world , from @entity89 to @entity90 to @entity91			0
" people were like , ' oh , you think your kids dress the cutest in @entity12 ? look how cute my kid is in wherever			1
' " @entity54 is hardly the only place on the internet devoted to kid swagger : @entity102 and @entity103 have given rise to devotees of kiddie fashion			1
some children , like @entity108 , have fan pages devoted to his natural ability to put a high - fashion outfit together			1
on @entity114 's viral @entity102 board , " my imaginary well - dressed toddler daughter , " there 's a less serious approach to the trend			1
it started out innocently enough -- a catalog for the adorable little girls ' clothing that came across her @entity102 page -- but her sense of humor quickly got the better of her			1
" i began finding all the elaborately dressed and highly styled kids , " said the the freelance copywriter from @entity127			1
her immediate reaction was to add captions about the fantastic life of a fictitious daughter , whom she named @entity134			0
" @entity134 says why walk into a room when you can shazam ! into a room ? " she wrote under a photo of a solemn blonde child in a black dress and ballet flats , kicking one leg behind her			2
" when @entity134 wants volume , she does n't just tease her hair , she relentlessly bullies it , " @entity114 labeled a photo of a wide eyed child with mile - high red hair			1
" it was when @entity134 demanded a miniature deer at her pre-k portrait session that i truly began to understand her gift , " she posted on a quirky photo of a girl with a messy updo , red tights and an ultra-short mushroom print dress , standing over , yes , a miniature deer			2
" it was also around that time that quinoa , the grain , had become extremely trendy , which i found hilarious			0
i mean , come on , a trendy grain ? i figured it was only going to be a matter of time before somebody named their kid @entity134 , " @entity114 said , " and then i realized that person would be me			0
" most of the images come from ad campaigns , but @entity114 has found that fashionably dressed tots have a large geographical footprint			0
" i 'll get tweets from people all over the world about ' quinoa sightings ' in their area , " @entity114 said			0
what 's less clear is how people feel about it			2
some adults really love the looks			2
some think it 's cute or hilarious			2
some find it weird , or even offensive			0
" is this cute and harmless or kind of perverse , " @entity114 said			0
@entity191 swagger might be off most parents ' radars , said @entity194 , a clinical psychologist and professor in @entity196 who specializes in child psychology			2
despite any artistry or irony these images present , they can have a much different meaning outside of @entity59 or the fashion community , @entity194 said			1
he worries about the potential for exploitation in mature styles that are sometimes picked , posed and photographed by adults , but very much featuring children			1
" that sense of feeling creeped out is there for a reason , " @entity194 said			0
it 's murky territory even for parents collecting , posting , organizing and distributing the images , he said			2
if parents actually focus on the social cachet of a child 's outfit , they could end up objectifying their children			1
" to some extent , these are children being treated like poodles , " he said			2
mass merchandisers and baby boutiques cater to that parental pride , and sometimes take advantage of it , he said			1
for example , baby shirts emblazoned with the logos of rock bands from the ' 70s and ' 80s say more about the parent than the child			0
" they 're selling an idea to a parent that says ' my child is cool ; i 'm cool			0
i 'm much older , but i have n't lost it			2
i 'm still just as happening as i was before , " he said			0
encouraging the sort of " @entity248 " affectations in kids is as easy as laughing at them or taking their picture			2
it teaches children that they get attention if they act that way , @entity194 said			2
often that 's a completely unconscious exercise , for parent and child , he said			2
after all , it 's not unusual for children to emulate what they see in pop culture			1
" every generation recreates its pop idols , " he said , " and much of what we see in youth culture is a response to the adult world			0
" but playing dress - up , after all , is one way toddlers learn about self - expression , @entity114 pointed out			0
" we all know that toddlers can be extremely opinionated , so with these well - dressed kids , it begs the question of who 's in charge , " she said			1
" i think we like to imagine both scenarios : maniacal parents forcing this on their kids , as well as headstrong kids throwing a tantrum because they really , really want that @entity287 jacket			0
" there is something a little strange about just how much sass her 4 - year - old daughter can show , said @entity52 , the @entity54 blogger			0
" when i turn a camera on her , she automatically goes into some kind of weird , funky , funny pose , " she said			0
but do n't feel too bad if you 've done your fair share of spamming @entity300 or @entity301 with your child 's personal fashion show			1
a photo of a kid with swagger is n't necessarily creepy , or bratty or parental pride gone wild			1
" it comes from , ' @entity310 , that dress is so cute on my daughter , ' " @entity52 said			0
" it does n't have to be any deeper than that			0
" do you think these kids are just expressing their natural fabulousness or that their parents need to step back and prioritize other qualities over fashion ? share your take in the comments section .			1

blogs , @entity102 and @entity103 *showcase* photos of children wearing high fashion
blogger : " the kids in @entity59 dress better than the adults in most of the rest of the country "
some says it 's parental pride , kids expressing themselves , or satire on style
psychologist : be *careful* that photos do n't become exploitative , creepy
