-- it 's logical -- especially when it has the support of capt. @entity4 and mr. @entity5			1
residents of @entity7 and other planets have until monday to weigh in on new names for two of @entity12 's moons , by voting on a website set up by the @entity14			1
based on those votes , the @entity16 scientific research organization will then propose names to the @entity19 , which makes the final call			2
and the runaway top pick , as of friday evening , is @entity22			0
roman mythology aficionados may see that as a tribute to the god of fire			0
but for others -- most notably , for legions of @entity31 fans -- it is better known as the home planet of @entity5 , the ever rational , ever loyal member of the starship enterprise			1
none other than @entity35 , who played @entity5 in the long - running @entity31 television series and string of movies , endorsed as " logical " the idea of naming one of the moons @entity22			1
@entity5 's former captain has been even more relentless			2
@entity4 -- or more accurately his human facsimile , @entity44 -- started his effort by urging @entity46 to write the @entity14 to get @entity22 added as an option			1
" it apparently made a difference as they now have added it as an official name , " @entity44 wrote on his @entity49 page on february 13			0
" is n't that wonderful			0
" since being added as one of 21 alternatives -- and with the help of regular online proddings by @entity44 , urging fans to vote @entity22 -- @entity5 's home has rocketed up the official online vote tally			1
it had about 140,000 votes by 6:30 p.m. et friday , far ahead of its next two closest competitors , @entity65 and @entity66 , both of which had about 80,000 votes each			0
there 's not much time for them to catch up , as the balloting ends at noon on february 25			0
but the second - place finisher has a nice consolation prize , since the @entity14 will be proposing two names			2
whatever happens , the moons that until now were only known as @entity78 and @entity66 are already lavishing in unprecedented attention -- as evidenced by the volume of votes and the shout - outs from sci - fi legends like @entity44 and @entity35			1
earthlings did n't even know about the two orbiting spheres until 2011 and 2012 , thanks to images from the @entity89			0
naming one of @entity12 's moons @entity22 is n't entirely out there			1
as the @entity14 notes , @entity12 's moons have long been derived from terms from @entity95 and @entity96 mythology and stories about @entity98 and the @entity99			1
hence the inclusion of contenders such as @entity102 and @entity103			0
that said , @entity5 and his fellow @entity22 could use a new home			1
in a 2009 @entity31 film , after all , @entity22 was obliterated by a villain named @entity108			2
absent another such calamity , though , @entity22 may once again be circulating in the heavens			0
that would give it a timelessness beyond the two hours or so of any such @entity31 film , allowing the beloved sci - fi franchise 's fans to rest easy knowing that @entity22 itself might " live long and prosper " for centuries , if not eons to come			2
more space and science news from @entity0 @entity121 @entity0 's @entity122 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity14 sets up an online vote to name two of @entity12 's moons
it will use the vote in proposing names to the @entity19
@entity22 -- the @entity96 god of fire and home planet of @entity5 , of @entity31 fame -- is winning
@entity44 and @entity35 have urged @entity46 to vote for the @entity22 name
