the build - up and anxiety over whether folks like @entity5 and @entity6 are going to throw their hats in the ring for the @entity10 presidential primary has reached critical mass. and now , the will - they - or - wo n't - they game has flipped from fun and energizing to damaging to the party			1
@entity5 and @entity6 now do conservatives more harm than good			1
with the question marks still lingering in the ether , and pundits on both sides of the aisle still performing their daily trapeze act -- swinging back and forth between " yes , he 's running " and " no , she is n't " -- the focus on @entity5 and @entity6 has taken valuable resources and attention away from the rest of the field			1
because of those question marks , conservatives have n't been able to invest fully in the candidates who are running			1
they have n't been able to imagine one of them as president			2
they 've held back support , money and endorsements , because they still do n't know that the field is settled			0
and @entity5 and @entity6 are not entirely without fault			1
though the bombastic @entity49 governor had been emphatic in his promise not to run for months , despite our continued speculation that he was fibbing , now his friends are saying otherwise			0
and he 's certainly been acting like a candidate , traveling the country for big - ticket fundraisers , speaking at the exalted @entity57 , and telling his supporters that he 's " hearing " and " feeling " their pleas			0
if he really wanted to convince us he was n't considering it , all he has to do is endorse someone else			2
it 's really very simple			0
as for @entity6 , she 's been forthright about her contemplation , admitting that she 's thinking about it but has n't yet decided			1
as formidable and admirable as both @entity5 and @entity6 are , it 's reached the point where they 've both become more than just a distraction			1
they 're now a detriment			0
how sincere will it look , after all , in two months when the field is set and both are absent from it , and conservatives suddenly try to pretend that they are satisfied and enthusiastic about @entity80 , @entity81 or @entity82 ? sure , we begged @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity5 , @entity6 and everyone else to run before , but now we 're totally behind one of these guys			1
if there were ever a gift to present to president @entity93 , it 's the gift of obvious apathy			0
time 's up , governors			0
if @entity5 and @entity6 want to run , get in there			1
if not , definitively and convincingly take your names out of the running			2
conservatives need to begin the arduous job of whittling down the field and picking their frontrunner			0
the fact that there have been five @entity10 straw polls in as many weeks with as many different winners is proof that these unanswered questions are creating a dangerous ambivalence among conservative voters			2
the breathless speculation has been fun , but now it 's time to get to work			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity118 .			0

are @entity5 and @entity6 running for president , or are n't they ?
their *refusal* to answer definitively is damaging to the @entity10 , said @entity118
conservatives have n't been able to invest fully in the candidates who are running , @entity118 said
@entity129 : @entity6 just has to decide , and @entity5 just has to endorse someone
