for something that predicts the future , the software is deceptively simple looking			1
a map of a city is marked up with small red squares , each indicating a 500 - by - 500 - foot zone where crimes are likely to take place next			1
a heat - map mode shows even more precisely where cars may be stolen , houses robbed , people mugged			0
the program is called @entity16 , and it calculates its forecasts based on times and locations of previous crimes , combined with sociological information about criminal behavior and patterns			1
the technology has been beta tested in the @entity26 , @entity28 police department for the past year , and in an @entity30 police precinct for the past six months , with promising results			1
predictive - analytics software is the latest piece of policing technology working its way into law - enforcement stations around the country , although it 's going up against tight budgets , bureaucracy and a culture still clinging to its analog ways			1
" we had to try something because we were not being offered more cops , " said @entity42 , a crime analyst with the @entity26 @entity43			2
last year , @entity42 contacted researchers working on the algorithm -- originally used for predicting earthquake aftershocks -- after reading an article in the @entity51			1
gadgets to help you survive a power outage at the time , his city had experienced a 30 % increase in crime and a 20 % decrease in police staff			1
he knew they had to try something			0
at first the @entity26 police department used the software to estimate where home , car and vehicle burglaries might take place , handing printouts of the maps to officers at the start of their shifts			1
later it expanded it to bike thefts , battery , assault and prowling			0
the city has seen a 19 % reduction in burglaries over the past year			2
while these kinds of experiments are promising , most police stations are still a far cry from the futuristic headquarters we see on tv shows like @entity90			1
real police departments lag behind your typical @entity93 teenager when it comes to technology -- some police cars still record video on @entity100 tapes , and it 's not uncommon to fill out a police report on carbon paper			1
last month , @entity104 mayor @entity103 announced plans to develop a smartphone app that would allow officers to file police reports from the field			2
but @entity112 chief information officer , @entity111 , told the @entity113 the department does n't have the budget to buy smartphones on which to run the app. ( @entity104 police officers only got e-mail addresses for the first time last year			2
) thankfully for crime fighters , it 's not all landlines , beepers and fax machines			2
cool new crime - fighting technology is still being developed and tested by agencies around the country			1
there are gadgets such as @entity132 's small wearable cameras for police and other security professionals			1
the units can mount on a pair of @entity138 sunglasses or a shirt collar , and they have accompanying @entity140 and @entity142 apps			0
in southern @entity144 , many police departments are using portable fingerprint scanners to id suspects and bring up any outstanding warrants on the spot			2
the smartphone - sized devices cost $ 2,500 apiece			0
a @entity152 system uses microphones positioned around a city to detect gunshots and triangulate their location within 40 to 50 feet			0
a human at @entity152 's headquarters confirms if it 's a gunshot and alerts the police			2
the system starts at $ 40,000 for every square mile of coverage			0
some of the more widely adopted tech is decidedly low - budget			0
police can @entity166 suspects and check their @entity168 profiles to gather information			2
friend says the @entity172 has had more luck posting photos of wanted suspects to the official department @entity176 than through traditional police channels			2
( the unusually tech - savvy department also has a @entity181 account , blog , and @entity184 channel			0
) now predictive policing software is picking up steam , thanks to a few well - publicized test cases , low overhead and impressive drops in crime rates that , while they ca n't be directly tied to any one initiative , bode well for the maps			1
hotel replaces printed bibles with @entity197 @entity16 is new to the field , but @entity199 has been testing predictive policing software since 2010 , using databases of past crimes and information like timing and weather to identify trends and map out predictions			1
the company has worked with police departments in @entity210 , @entity211 , and most recently @entity213 , @entity212			0
a final hurdle for all types of new technology is getting the officers themselves to adopt and use it			0
" law enforcement agencies historically are conservative in their approach to change			0
that includes to adopting all kinds of technology , from computers in the cars to even radios , " said friend			0
a new generation of police who have grown up immersed in technology will likely help ease the transition by communicating to older officers that the new tools only enhance what they already know			1
seasoned patrol cops rely on their instincts , developed over years of experience walking the same streets and patrolling familiar neighborhoods			0
experts say this new technology can cut down on paperwork and make policing more efficient so the police can focus on what they do best			1
" it does n't replace what they do , " said @entity221			0
" when they get into those locations , they still need to be good cops			0
" report : @entity252 will have camera , sharper display			0

predictive analytic software @entity16 anticipates future crime based upon past activity .
the program was *adapted* from similar software meant to predict earthquake aftershocks .
many police stations still use *obsolete* technology *due* to small budgets and *aversion* to change .
even so , police depend *heavily* upon social media to solve crimes .
