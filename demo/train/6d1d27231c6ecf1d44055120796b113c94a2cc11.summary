-- when dr. @entity2 got a text from her brother tuesday night that his wife was in labor , she was speaking at a fancy charity event for breast cancer research			2
as soon as her speech was over , she raced in her evening gown to @entity11 in @entity12 to watch her nephew , @entity14 @entity13 , come into the world			2
holding the newborn baby in the delivery room , @entity2 , 36 , was overwhelmed with joy , but it was tinged with sadness as she wondered when -- or whether -- she would ever have a baby of her own			2
an accomplished breast surgeon , @entity2 has no husband in sight			2
then she relaxed as she remembered what awaited her 50 blocks away : 13 eggs frozen in a bank at @entity29			0
if by the time @entity2 gets married the eggs in her ovaries are too old to work , she can thaw out her frozen eggs , have them fertilized with her husband 's sperm and implanted into her uterus , and hope that her younger eggs will succeed where her older eggs failed			1
freezing eggs for one 's own future use has become a growing trend , with an estimated 5,000 women nationwide making use of the technology , according to dr. @entity45 , medical director of the egg bank at @entity47 in @entity48			1
" i 'm really hoping i find mr. right soon , but if i do n't , having those eggs in the bank is a big weight off my shoulders , " says @entity2 , who banked her eggs in june			1
" it empowers women , " adds dr. @entity55 , program director of the @entity56			1
" patients get to be their own egg donors			1
" ( entertainment journalist @entity61 made news last week when she announced she 's freezing her eggs , but it turns out she 's actually doing something different -- read @entity64 to find out what			1
) " it 's an insurance policy , " says @entity2 , director of breast services at the @entity66			0
" maybe now i 'll be one of those lucky girls who has babies later in life			0
" " i never thought i would n't have kids at this point			1
" freezing your eggs may be an insurance policy , but it 's an expensive one			1
it costs thousands of dollars ( or in some cases , tens of thousands of dollars ) and it does n't always work			1
plenty of things can go wrong			0
@entity2 's 13 eggs might not survive the freezing process			1
they might not create viable embryos when mixed with her future husband 's sperm			0
and , even more likely , they might not attach to her uterus when doctors implant them			0
that 's why the @entity92 has n't endorsed egg freezing , calling it experimental and unproven			1
" patients need to be advised there are some things we do n't know , " says dr. @entity94 , a spokesman for @entity92			1
@entity99 , founder of the @entity100 , says a woman has to decide whether it 's worth it to take the financial risk			0
" if not having a baby is not an option , then i 'd go to @entity107 and play my cards , knowing that it 's @entity107 , " she says			0
if you 're considering preserving your eggs , here are five basic questions and answers : 1			0
how much will it cost ? centers charge between $ 6,500 and $ 15,000 per cycle , according to dr. @entity118 , the ceo of @entity47 in @entity48			0
@entity47 in @entity48 charges $ 7,600 per cycle , and @entity119 charges $ 12,000			0
some women need more than one cycle to get enough viable eggs			1
will it work ? @entity45 at @entity47 estimates that a woman who freezes her eggs between the ages of 32 and 35 will have a 40 to 50 % chance of achieving a successful pregnancy			1
if freezing between ages 35 and 38 , the rate goes down to 35 %			2
if freezing at 39 or 40 , it 's 20 to 25 % , and if freezing eggs over age 40 , the success rate will be less than 10 %			2
can i find out in advance if it 's worth the money to freeze my eggs ? a test for levels of @entity143 hormone can help predict whether doctors will get enough eggs to make the procedure worthwhile			0
" if the results are unfavorable , we say they 're probably wasting their time and money , " @entity45 says			0
what 's involved in freezing my eggs ? the procedure involves injecting yourself with medicines for 10 days , visiting the @entity156 office five or six times			2
about two days later , doctors will harvest your eggs while @entity160 under twilight sedation			0
most women feel little pain aside from a bit of cramping and breast tenderness , and go back to work the next day			1
how do i find the best place to freeze my eggs ? " make them show you their data , " @entity169 advises			0
" how many patients have they treated ? how many eggs did they get ? what is the data on survivability when they 're thawed ? " @entity2 says even if her eggs do n't work when she thaws them out , it was worth the financial risk			1
" i spent all this money on my education			0
twelve thousand dollars on my reproductive future is relatively inexpensive , " she says .			2

an estimated 5,000 women nationwide are using egg - freezing technology
process costs thousands of dollars and it does n't always work
