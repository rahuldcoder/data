-- i met @entity2 after the debut of her first self - titled album on @entity5			1
she was poised , graceful and strong			1
she was also sweet and laughed easily			2
this seems unremarkable today other than the fact that strong women were not exactly well - supported in those days in the music business			1
as in other professions when a female artist was successful , she was often accused of being demanding and diva - like even when all she sought was the same respect or artistic license that men of their stature received			2
so @entity2 's decency was noticed and her joy for singing was infectious			1
her mother , @entity22 , hovered and i suspect had a lot to do with her staying grounded for as long as she did			2
when she sang , our emotions rose and fell with her projection			2
her articulation of lyrics combined with a smoothness in her timbre created one of the greatest musical voices of all time			2
as with many famous people , the celebrity she achieved came with public attention beyond imagination -- and some of it was n't always very kind			1
she was criticized after her first two albums for not being " black enough			2
" her ballads were attacked for lacking rhythm			2
@entity45 , her mentor and executive producer , was accused of trying to keep her " white			2
" it was all nonsense of course , but i am certain it was painful			0
i vividly recall sitting next to a star who once had fame approximating @entity2 's but whose revenues were clearly on the downswing , speaking loudly to the rest of her table about how awful and lucky @entity2 was and how she did n't deserve her fame			1
@entity58 : @entity2 , special from the start the jealously and vitriol were significant			1
at the same time , the adulation of her fans around the world was huge			0
expectations for her were very high			0
as an @entity67 global superstar , she made a real difference in so many important causes			0
she lent her stature to the anti-apartheid movement , to the response to the @entity74 crisis and to the need for better educational opportunities for young black men and women			0
but no matter what she did , people always wanted more -- as we do of all stars			1
the public demand facing our celebrities is unrelenting			0
of course , i do n't know what drove her to drugs in the beginning , but drowning out the intensity around her was surely one of the side effects she came to depend upon			1
and of course , then there is addiction			0
as experts know , no matter how much consciousness you develop about your drug habit and no matter how much you want to quit , the chemical attraction is incredibly powerful and beckons over and over again			0
when sobriety makes apparent the reality of a disappointing showing at the box office , a failed new single or a harsh critical review , the failure that most of us bear in private is splashed on every media page in the world for all to see			1
for some artists , their talent is a precious gift , and they honor it by loving and taking care of themselves			0
for others , it becomes a burden			0
my favorite @entity2 song is " @entity122 , " a rousing anthem to learning to love yourself			1
it breaks my heart that the woman who inspired so much pride with this song suffered so much from her own demons			0
like @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and others before her , that inner voice of doubt that we all feel sometimes just could never keep up with the public adulation			0
and so the only answer in the moment that makes sense is to drown out the external praise and dull the doubt with drugs and alcohol			1
by many accounts from those close to her , she understood the dangers even as she was too often powerless to change			0
and she raised a wonderful daughter despite her troubles			0
that says so much about her determination to beat her addiction			0
i wish that our intense media culture allowed more space for celebrating the positives about people while they are alive and struggling			1
@entity2 's music legacy will be an inspiration to young artists for years to come			1
without taking one thing away from her amazing talent and my total and complete admiration for her career , i hope her troubled life in the spotlight will also serve as the right warning as well			0
