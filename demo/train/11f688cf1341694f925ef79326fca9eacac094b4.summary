@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the peak of @entity1 's relentless downpours , a year 's worth of rain fell in a day , disrupting the lives of 15 million men , women and children across the country			1
they might have otherwise have been celebrating fast - breaking feasts every evening during the @entity15 holy month of @entity16			1
and in two days , they might have celebrated independence -- @entity1 was partitioned off from @entity19 on august 14 , 1947 , a date observed with immense national pride			1
instead , @entity1 this year will be surrounded by the effects of the worst natural calamity since its creation , immersed literally in a uniquely dynamic disaster unlike anything they have seen before			1
thursday , almost two weeks into the crisis , president @entity28 finally got a firsthand look			1
he had been away in @entity31 during the worst of the flooding , an absence that was deeply felt in @entity1			1
he and his government came under blistering criticism for a perceived lack of action in helping those in need			2
presidential spokeswoman @entity40 said the criticism of @entity28 was unfair and that he has been involved from the start in directing relief efforts			1
" the president has always been concerned with the welfare of @entity1 's people , notwithstanding the venomous propaganda of his opponents , " @entity40 said			1
" his visit to flood - affected areas should effectively shut up those who would rather play politics than focus on helping those uprooted by raging waters			2
" but while the government defended its response , the scale of human misery started to become all the more apparent			2
the death toll climbed thursday to 1,343 , the @entity59 said			1
another 1,588 people have been injured and 352,291 people have been rescued			2
more than 722,600 houses and 4,600 villages have been damaged or destroyed			2
more people have been affected in the flooding than in the 2005 @entity1 earthquakes , the 2004 @entity66 tsunami and the january earthquake in @entity68 combined			1
in the mountainous north , water funneled down treacherous slopes , quickly engulfing the roads below			1
it surged down the mighty @entity77 , spreading economic , political and social woes through the heart of @entity1			1
the fetid stench of death filled the air in many places where mere seconds of unstoppable water ended lives			1
those who bore witness , even those who thought they had seen everything in this land marred by crisis and killing , were baffled by the suffering wrought by the monsoons			2
public health officials fear a second wave of deaths that might be caused by waterborne diseases if action is not taken quickly enough			1
more than 1 million @entity1 are in need of clean water			1
dr. @entity103 already is struggling to keep up with the demand for medical attention , so many people are sick with diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis			2
" we are facing much of the problems with the drinking water , because there is no electricity , " he said			1
towns such as @entity113 , in northwestern @entity1 , have been particularly hard hit			1
the stagnant water forced tens of thousands into temporary government camps			1
@entity117 , 60 , shares a flooded tent with eight family members after losing everything -- his house , all his possessions			2
his family survived with only the clothes on their back			2
the @entity128 estimated that 6 million @entity1 are , like @entity129 , in direct need of emergency aid , mainly food			1
@entity129 said food has been distributed in @entity113 , but in chaotic conditions			2
no one in this squalid camp of 18,000 people wants to miss getting their hands on the last few bags of rice			2
further north , at @entity142 , lies another common challenge			2
like 278 other crossings in the province , the @entity145 bridge was swept away by the sudden torrent			2
dump trucks are trying to close the gap			2
and men are finishing a suspension bridge so people and supplies can get to the other side			0
in @entity157 , @entity156 picks through the bricks that used to be his house			0
he and his 7 - year - old daughter @entity160 are suddenly homeless -- they will have to find somewhere to sleep here , amid the wreckage and rubble			0
@entity1 soldiers are already familiar with the towns and villages that dot the @entity168			1
last year , they fought fiercely to regain control of the from the @entity170			0
the task at hand is daunting in a different way			0
the @entity170 may have gone , but @entity175 charities with alleged links to terrorist groups are handing out food and , with it , a clear message			0
" the government is not working properly			0
that is why the people are working on their own self , so we are also from those people and we are joining hands with those people , " said one man who did not want to be identified			0
four @entity190 helicopters arrived here from @entity192 to help deliver aid , competing with the @entity175 charities			0
a silver ribbon of destruction guides them to the farthest reaches of the @entity168 towards @entity199			0
the @entity190 crew can see the rippled bridges and vast swaths of land eviscerated by water , scoured clean of vegetation , buildings and people			1
what lies below is a landscape robbed of color , robbed of signs of life			0
the town of @entity199 was once the @entity214 of the @entity215			0
now the tourist destination is hell on @entity218			0
the @entity219 unload bags of flour			0
for desperate recipients , the @entity222 are a lifeline			0
the aid situation is complicated by the fact that the humanitarian agencies are themselves victims of the flood			0
the @entity231 warehouse outside @entity113 should have been a busy distribution hub			0
instead , it sits under several feet of water			1
at its height , the water was three times deeper than it is now			1
it soaked 25,000 canvas tents in sewage - polluted water			1
the @entity231 had supplies worth $ 15 million in the warehouse			0
officials do n't know how much they will be able to salvage			1
" it makes me sad			0
the idea of pre-positioning stock is to allow us to move quickly with distribution of relief items , and this is back to square one , so to speak , " said @entity247 , of the @entity231			0
at a nearby camp , @entity254 could use a few of the @entity231 supplies			0
she is 70 and shivering outside a makeshift shelter			0
" we only managed to get our children out of the house , we have nothing literally nothing the only help we get is from members of the public , " said @entity254 's grandson			1
some people are so desperate that they have offered their children to strangers , hoping they 'll take them away from all this			0
others worry how they will feed their families with so many crops submerged and prices of tomatoes , cucumbers and other vegetables and fruits soaring in the markets			0
" the crop has been lost and it is a race against time to ensure the next sowing season can be met , " said @entity280 , the @entity128 special envoy			0
for now , though , the immediate focus is on evacuation			0
between breaks in the weather , men , women and children rush onto helicopters			0
some are clearly terrified about their first flight , even though they know it will take them to safety			0
@entity2 's @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			1
