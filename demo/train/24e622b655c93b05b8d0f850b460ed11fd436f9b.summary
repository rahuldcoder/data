-- it 's getting a lot of chatter , but is it real ? a new story about some @entity7 hospitals seeing a spike in births nine months after @entity10 has sparked talk that there just might be a @entity14 baby boom			1
@entity17 in @entity18 is seeing a 35 % jump , and two other hospitals are seeing 20 % increases , a review by the @entity16 found			0
it 's the latest in a series of reports suggesting that when @entity27 knocked out the power , some couples who were cooped up at home let nature take its course there , too			2
as @entity0 's @entity33 reported in march , some doctors have been overwhelmed with business			2
" it got to the point where we had to stop seeing new obstetrical patients to the practice , " said dr. @entity35 , who runs an @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity7			2
" we think we have a @entity10 baby , " @entity35 's patient @entity43 and her husband @entity44 told @entity0			1
@entity46 and @entity47 said the same			0
" well , there was no tv , " @entity47 said , blushing			0
@entity46 put it this way : " we just got closer			0
" for these couples , there 's no doubt that @entity10 -- amid all its destruction -- led to something joyous			2
a study suggests some natural disasters lead to an increase in pregnancies -- not where the destruction is most severe , but in areas that are affected and remain livable			1
" you may run out of power , but you 're not running for your life			0
there 's probably more opportunities for reproductive behavior , " says @entity66 , an assistant professor at @entity67 and author of the 2007 study " @entity70			0
" in 2009 , @entity0 affiliate @entity74 reported on some hospitals seeing an increase in births after @entity78			2
but some hospitals in the area struck by @entity10 are not reporting any increase in birth rates nine months after the storm			1
@entity10 still bringing down homes , but families vow to be back @entity91 's @entity90 has n't seen any such spike , dr. @entity86 , head of labor and delivery for the hospital , told @entity0 on wednesday			1
the idea that people have more babies after natural disasters is " just not documented , " he says			0
" i do n't know why people are even saying it			0
" these days , most people plan when to have children , and do n't suddenly change their minds in a storm , says @entity86 , who has worked in obstetrics in @entity91 for 40 years			2
and those who " do n't practice safe sex -- they 're going to have babies whether the lights are out or not , " he said			0
@entity108 , the online myth debunking site , says the baby boom reports that inevitably follow nine months after crises " typically prove to be nothing more than natural fluctuations in the birth rate , " or , in many cases , no variation in the birth rate at all			1
@entity118 , a demographer with the @entity119 , a nonprofit that provides information about population trends , has looked at birth rates for decades and never found clear evidence that a region has a baby boom nine months after a disaster			1
it 's possible , but it 's " hard to pin down " variations " to a single event , " he told @entity0 on wednesday			1
when post-storm baby booms are reported , they 're usually by individual hospitals , not broad regions , he said			1
so people in a small area may have stayed in and stayed busy , but they did n't represent a big swath of the population			0
nine months after the @entity91 blackout in november 1965 , the @entity139 reported on a sharp increase in births			0
the report turned out to be inaccurate , which the @entity139 itself later acknowledged			0
it will be some time before it can be determined whether @entity10 caused an overall baby boom in the @entity148			1
birth figures would need to be tallied and studied for numerous factors , particularly in areas that have been growing anyway			0
but for the couples @entity0 spoke with , what matters is the baby boom at home			1
@entity44 and @entity43 told @entity0 they ruled out one name for their child pretty quickly : " @entity158			1

report suggests a baby boom 9 months after @entity10 at some @entity7 hospitals
some couples told @entity0 their children were conceived during the storm
*experts* *disagree* over whether disasters lead to baby booms
some doctors say it 's a myth
