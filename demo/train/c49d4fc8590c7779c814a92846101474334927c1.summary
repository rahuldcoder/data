-- if you think television is like junk food , then binging on it is not for you			0
but there are many people not like you who love pixelated brain candy and think binge - viewing is the only way to devour a season ( or more ) of tv programming properly -- and networks are slowly beginning to take note			1
more and more viewers are turning on to elaborately scripted shows , tuning in via digitized devices and not dropping out : they 're watching marathons of their own making			1
instead of watching live each week by " appointment , " viewers are taking a full day ( or weekend or even week ) to watch a show 's entire season or a series from beginning to end			1
this may sound gluttonous and monotonous , but bingers see it differently -- a richer and more contemplative form of tv watching in which every nuance is savored and analyzed			2
providers are adapting to this craving for deeper , heartier , 22 - course meals			1
@entity34 recently premiered , all at once , the entire first season of its new political thriller " @entity37 , " and the tv streaming apps @entity38 and @entity40 have salad - bar layouts that make it easier than ever for viewers to immerse themselves fully in an entire series			1
the commercial reasons that once encouraged channels to sacrifice narrative quality for episodic quantity are fading , especially as many viewers turn away from monthly subscriptions in favor of the per - episode ( or per - season ) prix fixe to be found , say , at @entity54 , which dabbles both in online streaming and dvd sales			1
my friends who binge - watch do n't collapse into their couches , they commit to them , and this makes them demand a little more from programmers			1
shows such as " @entity65 , " " @entity66 " and " @entity67 " are richer in lengthy doses : the more time spent in those worlds , the deeper your appreciation for the changing times in the offices of @entity75 , the intricate history and tenuous alliances between the @entity78 and @entity79 , and the subtle , recurring jokes of the @entity82 family			1
watching , reading or listening to anything creative requires a suspension of disbelief , an investment of our reality in theirs			0
every commercial break erodes that thin and personal connection a little ; weeklong gaps between episodes stretch us closer and closer to the point at which our attention snaps and moves elsewhere			0
viewership declines , sometimes before a show has an opportunity to catch on , as with the often - discussed " @entity100 " or the more recent " @entity101 , " which struggled to find the hook that would keep audiences coming back			0
the pacing of some shows hardly even works on an individual level : though he would n't dare to tell you how to watch it , creator @entity107 would probably agree that binging on the entirety of " @entity111 " at once , letting the bigger picture wash over you , would bring you closer to his vision for the show			0
binge - watching can make for good tv			1
the actors on any number of indistinguishable cop shows are entertaining , affable , gruff or quirky , but i 'd turn to " @entity121 's " long - term development any day ... and the only reason i got hooked on it is because i spent a flu - ridden week catching up on the first two seasons			2
and that 's just network television : several of the friends whom i introduced to " @entity128 " chose not to watch the first half of the final season , preferring to get it later in one high - intensity dose			0
these friends picked up on subtle cues i had n't noticed late in that fourth season , were better able to get inside @entity136 's head , and became more a part of the series than i ever had : they 'd fully fallen down that serialized rabbit hole , and now i was the one who seemed like the dilettante , merely putting in an hour each week , scraping the icing off the top of the seven - layered cake			2
more critically , when another friend recently took a one - week safari through " @entity148 , " he could clearly distinguish its shark - jumping moment , whereas those of us who had watched live were suckered in , fond memories of the past overshadowing the tainted present			0
the more we change our viewing habits , the more the networks will adapt to fit them , and the higher the level of long - term programming networks will have to provide , no longer spider - webbing up plots on the fly in an attempt to deceptively tangle us into tuning in next week			2
the shift from casual couch - surfing to brisk binging also encourages television to be bolder in its storytelling , to develop characters and settings as opposed to just plots : the difference between literature and pulp , not that you ca n't have both			0
producing for the binger might also ease the stress of syndication , in which characters so often reset to the status quo that they might as well be contortionists on " @entity183			0
" and would n't advertising targeted at the people who would raptly sit through 10 hours of " @entity185 " be more effective than scatter - shot rounds of the generic stuff ? appointment television is dying , supplanted by @entity190 features that allow viewers to set the schedules			1
as each generation grows older and decides it is not writing the @entity195 , perhaps we 'll choose to watch the @entity196 , and realize it 's better when we do n't have to break the illusion and set down the book for a week after every chapter			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity203 : many people are binge - watching tv series , devouring seasons in a sitting
trend *challenges* " appointment " tv , he says , and providers are adapting
@entity203 : lengthy doses place narrative demands on programmers
as viewers move away from " appointment " tv , networks will adapt , improve shows , he says
