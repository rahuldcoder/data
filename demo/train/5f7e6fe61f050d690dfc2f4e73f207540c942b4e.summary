@entity4 has had control of @entity24 for more than a year , imposing its brutal interpretation of @entity8 law on the city 's residents			1
the extremists have made the city , which sits on the banks of the @entity34 , the de facto capital of their self - declared " @entity36 " that stretches across large areas of @entity5 and @entity38			1
@entity4 targets around other @entity5 cities -- @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 -- were also hit in the strikes			1
what is the @entity46 ? what was struck ? the attacks damaged multiple @entity4 targets , the @entity0 military said , including training compounds , headquarters , storage facilities , supply trucks and armed vehicles			1

the @entity69 also said @entity4 fighters were hit in the strikes but did n't specify how many			1
in @entity24 , a building in the governor 's compound , a post office and a recruitment center were among the sites struck , activists reported			1
maps : @entity2 nations join @entity0 , expand fight against terror to @entity5 why is @entity24 a focus of the initial strikes ? the city is known as a place where @entity4 houses training centers , weapons depots and accommodations for fighters			1
during the @entity5 conflict , the group has also seized military bases from the @entity5 regime near the city and in the wider @entity24 province			2
the targets hit by the airstrikes are intended to hurt @entity4 ' ability to command and control , resupply and train , a senior @entity0 military official told @entity59 's @entity103			1
@entity4 has made @entity24 the flagship for its model of governance , providing food , fuel and security to people struggling to survive after years of civil war			1
but it also imposed hardline @entity113 law there and metes out harsh punishment to those who do n't follow orders			0

" it 's a remarkable diplomatic achievement , " said @entity59 political commentator @entity135			1
" i do n't think it was expected that there would be this much @entity2 support			0
" how long will the attacks go on ? for a while			0
the first wave of strikes was expected to last into the early hours of tuesday morning in @entity5 , @entity59 's @entity142 reported			1
it is aimed at striking a strong initial blow , a senior @entity0 official told @entity59			1
the aerial campaign on @entity4 targets in @entity5 is expected to continue beyond tuesday			2
counterterrorism expert @entity150 said tuesday 's attacks were " just the start			0
" " this is not a definitive blow , " said @entity150 , who previously worked for the @entity153			0
" when this gets interesting to me as a former practitioner is six months down the road , when a second - tier @entity4 commander starts to create some sort of cell to recruit foreigners from @entity164 or the @entity0 or @entity165 into @entity5 , do we still have the will and capability , and the intelligence , to locate that person , or that group of people , and put lead on the target ? " what happens next ? @entity0 military officials will be trying to assess the effectiveness of the first night of bombing			1
some analysts have suggested that @entity4 had already started dispersing its assets and fighters after president @entity183 's warning of action in @entity5 earlier this month			2
the response of @entity4 fighters to the initial strikes may give military officials clues on what to target next			1
" the follow - up to some of these strikes is -- what are their actions now ? " said retired lt. gen. @entity190 , a @entity59 military analyst			1
" there is intelligence that flows from the initial strike , " he said			0
the @entity2 governments involved in the strikes could also face discontent among their own people			0
" parts of the population do not agree with @entity14 going against @entity14 , " @entity190 said			0
the @entity0 is also pushing for a binding resolution at the @entity206 this week that aims to prevent and track the travel of foreign fighters to @entity5			0
how has @entity4 reacted ? there was no immediate confirmed comment from the militant group on the strikes			2
@entity4 ' official @entity213 tweeted a photo that it claimed showed damage to a communications tower in @entity24			1
@entity59 was n't immediately able to independently verify the image			0
the militant group has increased security patrols in @entity24 , an opposition activist told @entity59			2
@entity4 has previously linked the @entity0 campaign of airstrikes in @entity38 to its decision to execute three of its @entity225 hostages -- two @entity0 and one @entity226			2
it also recently called for attacks against the @entity0 and its allies			0
how have @entity5 opposition groups reacted ? @entity230 , the president of the @entity232 , welcomed the strikes			0
" tonight , the international community has joined our fight against @entity4 in @entity5 , " he said in a statement			0
" we have called for airstrikes such as those that commenced tonight with a heavy heart and deep concern , as these strikes begin in our own homeland			0
we insist that utmost care is taken to avoid civilian casualties			0
" did the @entity0 consult with the @entity5 government beforehand ? the regime of president @entity249 said it was given a heads - up about the attacks through its ambassador to the @entity253 in @entity254			2
a senior @entity256 official confirmed that the @entity0 notified the @entity5 regime of the planned action , but the official said that the @entity183 administration did n't seek the regime 's permission or coordinate with it			2
finding the ' right ' @entity5 rebels @entity135 said @entity249 's government may end up as " the real winner " from the airstrikes on @entity4 , since the moderate @entity0 - backed rebels are n't " in a position to take this territory that we are pulverizing from the air			1
" did @entity183 have the authority to begin the attacks ? the @entity273 argues it does n't need any new authority ; that it 's using an existing authorization to combat @entity276 to expand its airstrike campaign			0
but some lawmakers say it 's @entity280 ' role , not the president 's , to declare war			0
they say they were open to holding a vote on military action against @entity4 -- but not until after the midterm elections in november			2
" it was one thing to attack in @entity38 , where you had a government that wanted us to , " @entity135 said			0
" but @entity280 did not vote for @entity0 airstrikes in @entity5 and we do n't have a government requesting us to do that			0
" what are @entity0 lawmakers saying ? when the strikes began , @entity280 had already left town to campaign for the midterm elections , and most of the reaction came from those who had pressed the administration to act sooner			2
privately , many of them conceded they were relieved not to have to take a vote on a controversial issue just weeks before voters went to the polls in november .			0

the strikes focus on @entity24 , the de facto capital of @entity4 ' self - declared @entity8 state
@entity130 , @entity132 , the @entity131 , @entity134 and @entity133 take part , the @entity0 military says
