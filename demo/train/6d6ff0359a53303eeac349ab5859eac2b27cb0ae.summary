@entity1 , @entity0 -- security remains a top concern , as @entity0 holds its second - ever presidential election thursday , prompting the government to ask for a ban on media coverage of violence			1

@entity0 's government has ordered the media to refrain from covering possible attacks on election day in an effort to " ensure the wide participation of the @entity0 people			1
" " if anybody broadcasts or gives news about any movements or activities of terrorists , domestic media offices will be closed , and foreigners will be kicked out of the country , " according to a statement from @entity31 spokesman @entity30			2
he said the order is in line with @entity0 's constitution , which allows for such mandates " in exceptional situations " to protect " national interest and national security			1
" escalating violence in the capital , @entity1 , this week has made some @entity0 think twice about whether to venture out to vote			1
" if we are not at peace , why should we vote , who should we vote for ? " asked @entity42 , 21 , who last weekend lay in a blood - soaked shirt and was connected to an intravenous drip after a suicide bombing			0
but at least one independent news agency refused to heed a blackout on reports of violence			1
restricting media freedoms has no basis in the @entity0 constitution , said the @entity1 - based @entity57			1
the @entity59 @entity58 in @entity1 insisted that press freedoms are necessary to ensure credible elections			1
" while we recognize the sovereign rights of the @entity0 government and note their intention to encourage @entity0 to turn out and vote , we believe that free media reporting is directly linked to the credibility of the elections and continue to support the freedom of the press and responsible reporting , " spokeswoman @entity62 said in an e-mail			1
on the eve of the election , roadside bombs killed three @entity0 election workers in the southern province of @entity78 , and four others were killed tuesday in the northern province of @entity81 , @entity82 of @entity0 spokesman @entity83 said			1
amid the violence , the candidates wrapped up last - minute campaigning with the hope that the elections can showcase their country 's fledgling democracy			1
" we 're at a moment of truth , " said @entity91 , senior vice president of the @entity92 , an independent advisory and analysis organization			2
an incumbent president and about 40 challengers , including two women , are on the ballot , vying for the votes of what the election commission says are an estimated 17 million registered @entity0 against a backdrop of war , graft , poverty and illiteracy			1
more than 3,000 donkeys , 3,000 cars and three helicopters will traverse harsh terrain to carry voting materials to remote polling stations , the election commission says			2
and 30 observer groups , domestic and international , will be on hand to help guard against fraud , it says			0
at the heart of every vote will be the two biggest impediments to progress in one of the poorest nations in the world : stifling corruption and an increasingly bloody @entity129 insurgency			1
international donors are helping pay for the $ 223 million electoral undertaking , and hundreds of @entity59 @entity133 and @entity0 soldiers have moved into strife - torn southern @entity0 to protect voters against possible @entity129 attacks			1
the top @entity59 envoy to the region , @entity140 , expressed optimism that thursday 's vote would be @entity0 's moment to shine			1
it 's tough to organize elections during a war , he said , but the reality is that violence during elections is commonplace in many parts of the world			2
" @entity0 has never had a contested election , " @entity140 said			1
" so this is a remarkable experiment in democracy and something that @entity0 needs to give legitimacy to the new government			1
" that legitimacy has become a key issue in the campaign			0
@entity164 president @entity163 's chief challengers -- former finance minister @entity165 and former foreign minister @entity166 -- have both lashed out at the incumbent for failing to rein in corruption			2
in its annual global corruption perception index in 2008 , @entity169 ranked @entity0 176 out of 180 countries and said graft is " a major factor impeding the country 's stability and future growth			1
" @entity165 said the most significant challenge @entity0 's next president will face is earning back the trust of the people			1
" this government has lost it , " he said in a recent interview			0
" there is no sense of trust , not only in the current leadership but in the political class as such			0
and in the capacity of the state or the international community to improve the lot of our people			0
" @entity165 characterized @entity163 as a " very poor manager " who failed to deal with pressing issues and create any sense of momentum for the nation moving forward			2
as a guest on @entity2 's " @entity202 " this month , @entity165 said @entity0 's corruption had metastasized into a cancer that was " eating through the society			1
" @entity166 argued that people 's dissatisfaction with the @entity163 government has helped strengthen the insurgency			2
" there is no doubt there is a hard - core element in it , " he said			0
" but there are thousands of people under the same brand , @entity129 , [ who ] have joined the insurgency because of other reasons			2
" the insurgents are filling a vacuum left by @entity0 's @entity223 - backed government , which foreign diplomats and military commanders concede suffers from nepotism , corruption and predatory practices			1
during a recent political debate , @entity163 admitted that corruption was a problem but offered no specific cures			2
he also has been blamed for what has become the bloodiest summer since the fall of the @entity129 regime in 2001			0
most polls , however , show @entity163 with a commanding lead			0
@entity238 , a @entity1 housewife , said she was pleased with @entity163 's stewardship and would vote for him			2
" like raising a child for seven years , in seven years he has helped our @entity1 , our @entity0 , stand on its own two feet , " she said			1
" we did n't know an election before ; we had n't seen a parliament			0
" but can a nation as troubled as @entity0 carry out fair and free elections ? some observers of @entity0 and human rights activists have voiced their doubts			2
@entity249 , the @entity250 special representative in @entity0 , said thursday 's election will be the most difficult he has encountered in his life			1
besides the violence and corruption , a weak infrastructure and a high illiteracy rate will add to election woes , he said			1
the problems were reflected in a new @entity259 that found fewer than one in four voting - age @entity0 are confident the election will be fair and transparent			1
voting in @entity0 , @entity249 said , is not yet the kind of democratic expression understood in the @entity263			2
" if you look at the well - established democracies in the @entity263 , for instance , that 's not possible under these circumstances , " he said			0
" but what my objective is that we have credible , inclusive elections where the result will be accepted by the people			0
that is our level of ambition , and i think we will achieve that			0
" @entity249 said that a significant number of polling stations in @entity281 , @entity78 , @entity282 and @entity284 provinces will not be able to open for security reasons			0
he said ballots ought to be counted at the polling center itself instead of transporting them elsewhere and increasing the possibility of fraud , encountered in the last election in 2004			0
of the 4.6 million new registered voters , 39 percent are women			0
so thousands of women had to be employed to search burqa - clad female voters at polling places			0
@entity298 , however , said this week that the recruitment drive for women began too late and as a result , not enough women will be available for security checks			0
" women voters have been badly let down by their government and its international backers , " said @entity304 , @entity305 director for @entity298			0
women 's votes will be closely watched in @entity0 , where the @entity129 regime stripped women of equal rights and education , essentially hurtling them back to the @entity315			2
but despite the violence , despite the threats from the @entity129 to disrupt the voting , enthusiasm filled the air this week			0
a campaign rally resembled more a rock concert than a political event in @entity0 , as @entity1 stadium transformed into a sea of blue , @entity166 's campaign color			1
supporters hoisted banners and sported t - shirts emblazoned with @entity166 's face			0
not old enough to vote , another young woman named @entity42 -- this one 15 years old and a beauty school student -- attended a rally for @entity165 with many of her classmates			0
" we want a president who is peaceful and caring , " she said			0
" we do n't want any more bombs			0
in these bombs , so many @entity0 have died , one person 's son , one person 's child			1
" but no one can predict whether abounding energy will translate into high turnout			0
not in a war - ravaged nation			0
not when bombs were still exploding just hours before balloting was to begin			0
@entity2 's @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 and @entity353 contributed to this report .			0
