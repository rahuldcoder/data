-- chemists used to use balls and sticks to make models to help them understand how molecules worked			1
on wednesday , the @entity8 in chemistry rewarded three scientists for work leading to the computer programs used today to precisely calculate how very complex molecules work			1
accomplishments by chemists @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 have enabled programs to even predict the outcomes of very complex chemical reactions			1
as a result , computers have become just as important in chemistry labs as test tubes , the @entity25 said when announcing the prize			2
slow motion the exact mechanics of a chemical reaction are hard to observe in the laboratory			1
" molecules are lazy creatures			1
most of the time they do n't do anything , " said @entity33 from the @entity34			2
" they just swing around and do n't do anything , and then suddenly , when they react , everything goes quick , like that			2
" new computer programs allow scientists to make models of these speedy reactions and study them at a slower pace , he said			1
the three scientists combined the principles of traditional newtonian physics , which has the advantage of being simple , with quantum physics , which is much more complex but also much more accurate , because it deals with what goes on at a subatomic level			1
that has resulted in programs that are simple to use but also highly accurate			2
predictions made by the programs eliminate the need for some lab testing			1
for example , they help reduce the necessity of testing a new drug on animals , @entity33 said			1
@entity15 researches at @entity69 and at the @entity70 in @entity71			0
@entity16 is based at @entity72 , and @entity17 is based at the @entity73			0
all three were born in other countries			0
they received the @entity8 jointly and will split the prize money of 8 million @entity78 kronor ( $ 1.2 million )			1
' @entity81 particle ' theorists receive @entity8 in physics last year two @entity84 scientists won the @entity8 in chemistry in 2012 for their work revealing protein receptors that tell cells what is going on in and around the human body			1
their achievements have allowed drugmakers to develop medication with fewer side effects			0
research spanning four decades by @entity96 and @entity97 on " g - protein - coupled receptors " has increased understanding of how cells sense chemicals in the bloodstream and external stimuli such as light , said the @entity25 , which awarded the prize			0
this week two @entity84 and a @entity105 shared this year 's @entity8 in physiology or medicine monday			1
@entity84 @entity108 and @entity109 , and @entity105 @entity110 were honored for discoveries of how the body 's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce			2
and on tuesday , two men who predicted the existence of the higgs boson particle 50 years before its discovery took the prize for physics -- @entity123 of @entity124 and @entity125 of the @entity126			0
@entity125 and @entity123 's theories of the elusive particle explained what gives matter its mass and played a key role in completing scientists ' understanding of the nature of all matter			0
@entity8 medical prize goes to 2 @entity84 , 1 @entity105 @entity8 history since 1901 , the @entity139 has handed out the @entity8 in chemistry 105 times			1
in certain years , mainly during @entity144 , no prize in chemistry was awarded			0
the youngest recipient was @entity146 , who won in 1935 at the age of 35			0
the oldest chemistry laureate was @entity149 , who was 85 when he received the prize in 2002			0
@entity151 was the only scientist to win the chemistry prize twice for his work related to the structure of proteins and @entity156			2
there is a fine line between the science of chemistry and the fields of physics and biology			0
famed female scientist @entity165 of @entity71 , for example , won @entity8 honors for her work in radiophysics in 1903 and again in 1911 for discoveries in radiochemistry			1
the committee also will announce prizes in literature , peace and economics in the coming days			0
@entity78 industrialist @entity176 created the prizes in 1895 to honor work in physics , chemistry , literature and peace			2
the first economics prize was awarded in 1969			0
follow @ @entity182 on @entity183 for more science news updates			0

the advancements could help reduce the need for drug testing on animals
chemists used to used balls and sticks to make models of molecules
today , computer programs show *detailed* *depictions* and predict complex chemical reactions
the work of the @entity8 winners led to the creation of these programs
