a federal judge struck down @entity2 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage monday			1
" because @entity2 's marriage laws discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation without a rational relationship to any legitimate government interest , the laws violate the @entity13 to the @entity14 , " @entity5 district judge @entity4 said in his ruling			1
@entity2 voters passed @entity16 36 in 2004 , which amended the state 's @entity18 to define marriage as between one man and a woman			2
in february , the state 's attorney general said she would not defend the ban in court because it would not stand up to a federal constitutional challenge			2
" my decision will not be the final word on this subject , but on this issue of marriage i am struck more by our similarities than our differences			0
i believe that if we can look for a moment past gender and sexuality , we can see in these plaintiffs nothing more or less than our own families , families who we would expect our @entity18 to protect , if not exalt , in equal measure , " @entity4 said			0
" with discernment we see not shadows lurking in closets or the stereotypes of what was once believed ; rather , we see families committed to the common purpose of love , devotion , and service to the greater community			0
" same - sex couples camped out in lawn chairs outside a government building in @entity2 's largest county while waiting for the news , then cheered as word of the judge 's decision spread			1
@entity62 began issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples minutes later , the county said in a statement			1
@entity66 , one of the plaintiffs who challenged @entity2 's constitutional ban , stood beside his fiance and his son as he told @entity72 affiliate @entity71 that he was thrilled by the news			1
we 're part of history			0
our family is recognized , i mean , i 'm tingling			0
it 's amazing , " he said			0
" it means that my son 's family is just as legitimate as the one next door , and that he can grow up proud			1
" at a news conference shortly after the judge 's ruling , activists and attorneys who challenged the amendment celebrated the news			0
" @entity95 won today , " said @entity93 , national field director for the @entity94			1
ten years ago , @entity93 said , the first same - sex marriages in the @entity5 were celebrated in @entity97			2
and 45 years ago marked another historic moment , he said			0
" same - sex couples were arrested and sent to jail for dancing together at establishments like the @entity102 , " he said			2
" today , 45 years later , in 18 states and now including @entity2 and the @entity105 , same - sex couples are dancing together at their own weddings , and they have wedding rings , not handcuffs			1
" meanwhile , the @entity111 , which opposes same - sex marriage , said it had filed a motion with the 9th @entity114 asking judges to block @entity4 's ruling			1
" this case is an ugly example of inappropriate cooperation between the attorney general and the gay marriage lobby , both of whom want to redefine marriage in contravention of the overwhelming decision of the people to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman , " @entity117 , the organization 's president , said in a statement			0
" the people of @entity2 are entitled to a defense of their decision on marriage rather than being abandoned in court			2
" same - sex marriage now allowed in 18 states the @entity2 ruling continues a near - unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year for supporters of same - sex marriage			1
seventeen other states and the @entity105 allow same - sex marriage within their borders : @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity97 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , and @entity105			1
just over a decade ago , there were none			0
earlier this month , judges in @entity169 and @entity170 ruled that same - sex marriage bans in those states were unconstitutional			1
both decisions are being appealed			0
this month also marks the two - year anniversary of president @entity175 voicing his public support for the first time of same - sex marriage , citing his own " evolution " on the issue			1
" at a certain point , i 've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same - sex couples should be able to get married , " @entity175 said at the time			2
groups supporting same - sex marriage applauded the @entity2 ruling			1
" the importance of judge @entity4 's decision can not be overemphasized , " said @entity187 , executive director of the @entity188 of @entity2			2
" our federal constitution does not allow any state -- or its voters -- to deny same - sex couples equal protection under the law simply because of who they are and who they love			2
this type of discrimination is wrong , and it 's also unconstitutional			0
" but court battles over the matter are far from over			0
about 70 cases dealing with same - sex marriage are now making their way through @entity5 courts			1
separate federal appeals courts in recent weeks heard challenges to same - sex marriage bans in @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212			1
similar appeals will be heard on current bans in @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219			0
federal judge orders @entity210 to recognize same - sex marriages also monday , a federal judge said @entity210 must recognize the marriages of more than 1,200 same - sex couples who obtained marriage licenses earlier this year after a court struck down that state 's same - sex marriage ban			1
the @entity5 @entity229 days later issued a stay preventing any more same - sex marriages , but that action left those who got married in the interim in legal limbo			2
the judge 's ruling monday says @entity210 must give those couples " all the protections , benefits , and responsibilities given to all marriages under @entity210 law			0
" while some details of the @entity2 and @entity210 cases are similar , there 's a key difference			0
in @entity210 , the state is appealing a judge 's decision to overturn its voter - approved ban of same - sex marriage			1
gov. @entity253 slammed what he said was a decision by an " activist federal judge			0
" in @entity2 , officials are taking the opposite tack , praising the judge 's ruling overturning their state 's same - sex marriage ban			1
" now , finally , all @entity263 will have the opportunity to make a legal commitment to the person they love			0
every person and every family in @entity2 deserves that chance , " gov. @entity268 said in a statement			0
" today is a win for love , for families , and for freedom			0
