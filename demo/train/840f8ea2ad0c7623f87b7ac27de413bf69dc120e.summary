@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 gov. @entity3 made headlines last week when one of his aides admitted that he had surgery to lose weight			1
@entity3 said that the surgery had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with his health and his family			1
@entity3 said : " it 's not a career issue for me			1
it is a long - term health issue for me and that 's the basis on which i made this decision			2
it 's not about anything other than that			0
" it is impossible to know whether we should take @entity3 at face value			1
given that there has been ongoing speculation about his presidential aspirations for 2016 , often coupled with discussions of his struggle with weight , it is certainly not unreasonable to wonder whether these are related			1
why do @entity36 care about the weight of a candidate and why is appearance an issue in presidential elections ? there is very little chance that the issue will go away			1
certainly , old - fashioned bias has something to do with this concern			2
the willingness to ridicule obesity and make fun of appearances based on weight remains more acceptable than other kinds of biased comments that are no longer tolerated			1
one study by @entity56 recently showed that male jurors were biased against heavy women , and more likely to find them guilty than leaner women			0
some have called obesity the last acceptable bias in @entity36 life			1
opinion : congrats gov. @entity3 - you saved your life we are also in a political era when politicians are more in the public eye than ever before			1
like it or not , appearance matters			0
when @entity73 -- weighing in at over 300 pounds -- was president , most @entity36 rarely saw him , though jokes about his weight still circulated			1
but it was still a very different world			0
in the early 20th century , there was no television or @entity80 broadcasting constant footage of the president in action			0
other than the occasional still image in the newspaper , or the footage in the newsreels before movies until the 1940s , politics was still a medium of words and print			0
since the emergence of television , however , we live in a visual political culture where appearances have become much more important			2
we vote based on what we see , or at least that is part of the calculation			0
it has become more important for presidents to convey the charisma of a @entity105 and harder for those who are not as easy on the eye			2
shallow visual preferences are not the only dynamic at work , however			0
the last half century has witnessed massive improvements in personal health			0
@entity36 are living longer and living better as a result of great advances in our understanding of nutrition and physical care			1
it is no longer uncommon for @entity36 to use a gym on a regular basis and to be much more cautious about what they eat			1
we expect politicians to live by the same standards			0
indeed , we want our leaders to set examples for the rest of the nation			0
@entity3 is certainly not the only candidate to face these kinds of questions			1
when @entity134 ran for the presidency in 1992 , the media covered his tendency to eat junk food on the campaign trail and his weight gains were treated as problematic			1
after @entity134 gained 30 pounds during the @entity142 primaries , @entity140 noted , " the good news is , my husband loves to eat and enjoys it			0
the bad news is , he loves to eat , even when things are not always right for him			0
" another reason that weight and other physical health concerns have become more important is that the job of the presidency has become much more demanding			1
as the role of the federal government has expanded at home and the presence of the @entity36 overseas has intensified , there is much more for a president to handle on a daily basis			2
the massive size of the executive branch and intense 24 - hour news cycle makes the presidency a physically brutal job			1
we often watch as presidents enter the @entity167 looking young and spry , then exit with gray hair , tired and visibly worn down			0
as with many other high - powered jobs , physical health is important to the ability of a person to handle these kinds of tasks , so it is logical that these considerations enter into the conversation			2
all of this is to say that there are many reasons why voters and reporters will talk about @entity3 's weight , and why @entity3 's weight could become a major issue if he runs for president in 2016			1
it 's important to note that there is some social science evidence that in certain cases voters may not be swayed by weight			0
in fact , according to one study , voters in certain cases can prefer obese to non-obese candidates			0
the studies showing this finding are still limited and , from the evidence of the presidential races of the past century , the signs still point to voters preferring candidates who are leaner			2
there is clearly a huge risk in making our decisions about leaders based on appearances , which really do tell us little about what a person would do when faced with the big challenges of the day			0
regardless , the conversation is unlikely to subside , given the times in which we live			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2

@entity3 , a potential presidential candidate , had weight - loss surgery
@entity220 says candidates should *n't* be *judged* on appearances
but @entity36 will *inevitably* take weight and *fitness* into account , he says
