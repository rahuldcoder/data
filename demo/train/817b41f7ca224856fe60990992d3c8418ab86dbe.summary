@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's the weekend in @entity1 and the city 's upper crust is letting loose at @entity6 , one of the latest night - time spots to open in the @entity0 capital			1
the city 's hip young things strut their stuff on the dance floor while cocktail waiters confidently juggle bottles behind the bar			1
but behind the whirls , twirls and clinking of glasses is some serious investment			2
nearly half a million dollars has poured into this stylish venture since it began			2
" we have a lot of support from sponsors , from different international and multinational companies that see it as an opportunity to offer their brands and their experiences as well and it makes it way more profitable , " said owner of @entity6 , @entity26			2
" there has n't been a better time to open and attract people to positive experiences than the time we are in now			2
" the garden is booked out every night and @entity26 and his partners are bullish about the future			0
" it 's a very profitable and positive business , if you play your cards right and get the right flow of costumers , " he said			1
" it would n't take a year , year and a half to get a return on your investment			0
" such success is attracting attention of others in the entertainment and nightlife industry			1
at least five new drinking establishments have recently opened their doors in the city -- a sign the industry maybe slowly shaking off three years of despair			1
the downturn started with the 2011 revolution that ousted then president @entity66			1
the election of an @entity69 president , @entity68 , in 2012 had the industry fearful for its survival			1
@entity68 would last barely a year in office , however , as a military coup ousted him in 2013			0
through that entire time , a shattered economy was kept down by violence and uncertainty			0
but not everywhere was suffering			0
@entity78 , a chic establishment known for drinks with a dash of chemistry , opened at the height of the turmoil in 2012			0
according to @entity78 owner and industry veteran , @entity88 , the conditions always existed for smartly run bars and restaurants to prosper			1
" a lot of investors are looking at what is running and surviving the revolution , and economic prices and that is mainly food outlets , coffee shops and i would say eventually nightlife , " @entity88 said			1
it boils down to one simple thing , @entity88 believes			0
" people do want to party , do want to forget their daily life a bit , " he said			0
building on their initial success , @entity88 and his partners plan to open a new club soon			0
@entity26 is also eying three new venues over the next three years , equaling millions of dollars in investment			1
but this is @entity0 , where political and economic chaos persist and neither @entity26 nor @entity88 take that for granted			1
" of course we are bullish but we are n't foolish , " @entity26 said			0
" if we find it unprofitable , we wo n't go into it			0
" it 's a delicate balancing act like that performed by the skilled cocktail waiters at @entity6			2
both @entity26 and @entity88 hope it will pay out in dividends			0
