-- considering the deep bench of a-list talent involved , @entity3 's new @entity2 noir , " @entity1 , " is a jaw - dropping misfire			1
the dialogue is laughably pretentious , the plotting is virtually nonexistent , and the performances are so broad and cartoony that you keep wondering if it 's all some sort of prank			1
reteaming with @entity3 after the disappointing " @entity14 , " @entity13 stars as a smooth , naive lawyer operating in the moral gray zone along the border between @entity18 and @entity19			1
it 's a godforsaken land where drugs are cheap and life is cheaper			2
after years defending crooked clients there , @entity13 's '' counselor '' finds all of the easy money too tempting to resist			0
so he sells his soul and saddles up with a ring of flashy bad guys for a big drug - smuggling score			0
box office preview : ' @entity33 ' ready to take down ' gravity ' there 's @entity35 as @entity36 , a spiky haired playboy who looks like he picked his wardrobe from a @entity39 yard sale ; @entity40 as @entity41 , a charismatically mysterious stringy - haired hood who speaks in cryptic riddles ; and @entity45 as @entity46 , a sex - crazed harpy covered in tattooed spots to match her pet cheetahs			0
( this is the film 's subtle idea of character development			1
) for all of her man - eating efforts in the film , @entity45 is punished with one of the most wince - inducing scenes in years — a spread - eagle masturbation spectacle performed on the hood of @entity35 's yellow @entity59 that i 'd say has to be seen to be believed			1
but i would n't want to encourage anyone to cough up ten bucks to sit through it			0
if the film 's posse of ethically shady villains seems right out of a bad @entity68 novel , that 's because it more or less is			1
" @entity1 " is the celebrated bard of the borderland 's first feature - film screenplay			1
and as @entity13 's drug deal goes sour , putting his fiancée ( @entity74 ) in harm 's way , he 's forced to listen to a lot of poorly - sketched characters wander on screen and deliver stilted metaphorical speeches about greed and the evil that men do			0
' @entity84 : @entity85 ' pushed to january all of this may have seemed fine and dandy on the page			0
but i suspect that @entity68 is about to find out the hard way that writing novels and writing screenplays are two very different things			1
in " @entity94 , " the @entity93 wisely stripped the author 's doomed tough - guy dialogue and injected it with a stiff dose of harrowing naturalism			2
but operating on his own here , @entity68 's unchecked macho arias leave you sitting there slack - jawed , wondering if he has any idea how people talk in real life			1
@entity3 does n't do him any favors either			2
the director surrounds the garishly painted characters in excessive dollops of glitzy opulence , hammer - to - the - skull symbolism , and sex scenes that are as embarrassing as they are un-erotic — the film 's paranoid view of women comes off as downright @entity116			2
i suppose the only good thing than can be said of a movie as bad as " @entity1 " is that its existence is a reminder of just how right @entity121 usually gets it			2
big honking bombs as bad as this one are like solar eclipses			0
rare and not to be looked at directly			0
