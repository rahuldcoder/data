-- this may turn into much more than just a political scandal			1
it may have seemed like a teenage prank at the time , but the blockage of bridge traffic as a possible act of partisan political revenge has put @entity11 gov. @entity10 in the middle of a serious legal stew			1
and the fire underneath it is just beginning to heat up for the @entity17 presidential hopeful , as the state assembly plans to post online 907 pages of documents related to the case friday			1
state lawmakers questioned one of @entity10 's allies thursday , a former state official implicated in the scandal			1
so far , @entity27 has repeatedly refused to answer , invoking his @entity28 right against self - incrimination			2
the legislators charged him with contempt for his lack of cooperation			0
but the dam could eventually break as lawmakers dig in their heels , analysts say			0
as long as @entity10 was telling the truth at a marathon news conference he held thursday -- that is , if he really did n't know anything about any wrongdoing -- he should be able to step out of the caldron , analysts who spoke with @entity0 say			1
for nearly two hours , the high - profile governor , who gained national recognition for his response to @entity49 , answered questions from journalists , divulging many details			2
" he was pretty specific about what he knew and when he knew it , " said @entity0 analyst @entity54 on " the lead with @entity56			2
" but if any of it does n't jibe with other people 's stories , information provided in documents or clues that pop up , experts say @entity10 could get dragged into civil and criminal lawsuits			1
the legislative inquiry into the alleged misdeeds that led to the traffic jam on the @entity70 is just getting into gear			2
what happened to begin with ? it was september , and @entity10 was full steam into his re-election bid -- which he won two months later			1
@entity27 , whom @entity10 appointed to a high position at the @entity78 and @entity11 , ordered the closing of two of the three lanes of traffic leading to the @entity70 in @entity83			1
it held up motorists trying to make it into @entity87 and caused days of massive traffic jams in @entity83 , where @entity90 mayor @entity89 had not endorsed @entity10 for re-election			1
democrats speculated that the mayhem was political retaliation against @entity89			1
hearings ensued , and @entity27 resigned under pressure			0
then came wednesday 's revelation that a top @entity10 aide , @entity99 had e-mailed @entity27 before the closures , telling him , " time for some traffic problems in @entity83			1
" " got it , " @entity27 replied			0
he e-mailed a comment that the parents of children stuck in school buses in the traffic jams were @entity90 voters			2
@entity10 fired @entity99 after the scandal broke			1
possible prank , sure , but something to sue over ? this was no fun and games for people who sat tormented for hours in traffic and missed important appointments , legal analyst @entity117 told @entity0 's @entity118			1
" it was utter chaos those days			2
people were pouring into the store , complaining , " @entity123 recalled thursday in her shop , @entity125 , in the town of @entity83			0
" the bridge is a lifeline here			0
you take away the bridge , you take away our livelihood			0
" that makes it a legal matter , @entity117 said			0
" the law looks backwards and says : what causes these harms ? " he said			0
one group of residents from @entity144 , where @entity83 is located , has already filed a class - action civil lawsuit against @entity10			1
they want to be compensated for alleged wages lost when they arrived late at work			0
was a crime committed ? a woman died at the time of the mayhem , and emergency workers trying to get to her to save her complained that the traffic jams slowed them down			1
@entity89 thinks there should be a criminal investigation into the incident , saying it put " folks in absolute danger			0
" his @entity90 colleague , @entity11 state sen. @entity161 , agrees but takes it a step further			1
he called for federal prosecutors to open an investigation into whether the lane closures were a factor in the woman 's death			1
" endangering people 's lives -- that 's not politics			2
that 's why the @entity176 attorneys have to get involved , " he said			2
@entity178 spokeswoman @entity177 said it 's " reviewing " whether federal laws were violated			2
but @entity182 's family does n't seem to want to press charges			2
she was 91 when she went into cardiac arrest , and her daughter @entity185 told @entity0 affiliate @entity186 that she did n't think the traffic was to blame			2
" i really do n't think so , no , i really do n't			0
i think she was 91 and really believe in my heart that she was already gone when the ambulance got ( to her house ) , " she said			0
but @entity182 was not alone			0
no other deaths were reported			0
but paramedics red - flagged " unnecessary delays for emergency services " to the mayor on the second day of the lane closures			1
the traffic increased their reaction time in at least four cases			2
legal analyst @entity117 thinks a crime may have indeed been committed and prosecutors could land convictions against @entity27 , @entity99 and anyone else implicated , " particularly if they can demonstrate if the woman died as a result of the traffic jam			1
" @entity10 says he did n't know anything about this			1
how could this get him ? if @entity10 's close associates are prosecuted or convicted , it could lead them to turn on @entity10 , @entity117 said			1
thursday 's news conference was the longest and most candid in @entity10 's career , @entity215 , a @entity11 public radio reporter , told @entity56			1
" this is absolutely extraordinary , " he said			0
@entity10 offered a lot of information to back up his claim that he knew nothing			1
at the same time , he may have given @entity27 and @entity99 a lot to contradict , should they open up to lawmakers questioning them			0
" they may very well want to save themselves and say , ' wait a minute ; do n't believe what the governor said , ' " @entity117 told @entity118			0
@entity27 may have pleaded the @entity28 initially , but that 's normal in the beginning , @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity230 told @entity0 's @entity233			1
defense lawyers often start by telling their clients to take the @entity28			0
" you do n't want your client testifying until he has seen all the documents available			0
" but things could change			0
if lawmakers decide to go after @entity10 , they could offer @entity27 -- or @entity99 , if they question her -- immunity			1
they could decide to save themselves at his expense , @entity230 said			0
anyone @entity10 fired may also try to get revenge			1
and if @entity10 really did n't know about alleged misdeeds , he could still be in hot water , @entity117 said			2
" there 's a concept in law called willful blindness , " he said			0
it 's enough to just suggest to people working for him to commit illegal actions on his behalf or to create an atmosphere that promotes such actions			0
@entity117 said that it would be enough for the governor to say : " do n't tell me ; i do n't want to know ; just do what you have to do to take revenge			0
i do n't want to know the details			0
" @entity0 's @entity266 contributed to this report .			0
