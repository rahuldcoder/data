the bracelet was uncomfortable , inconvenient and cost @entity10 $ 105 a week , her attorneys argued			1

" during these trips ... the electronic monitoring gps device afforded no protection or benefit to ms. @entity28 , as the defendant could freely move about @entity23 , " @entity14 wrote			2

her trial is to begin next month			0
if convicted she could face a sentence of up to life in prison			0
prosecutors say @entity10 drove nearly 900 miles from @entity23 to @entity71 , @entity6 -- wearing diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and went to @entity75 on february 5			2
she put on a disguise and followed @entity28 from baggage claim to the parking lot , according to court papers			0

@entity93 , who was also an astronaut			0
@entity93 has since left the astronaut corps			0
@entity10 's attorneys earlier this month filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense , saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders			1
in his ruling , @entity40 noted that @entity10 , a @entity105 captain , would face additional penalties from the military if she were to violate the conditions of her pretrial release			0
@entity10 has no reason to travel to @entity6 , where @entity28 lives , other than to appear in court , consult with her attorneys or fulfill her military duties , he said , and no reason to travel to @entity116 -- where @entity28 's boyfriend now lives			1
