-- @entity1 appears to be run by screenwriters , where the rule is to get as close to the cliff as possible			1
drive off , if it wo n't be too unbelievable			1
then -- like young @entity7 in the @entity9 reboot of @entity10 -- jump out as the car plunges to the bottom and climb your way back up			2
that 's great @entity16 -- and perhaps the best - case scenario in @entity1 as lawmakers drive toward the fiscal cliff			1
there 's an upside too			2
if you watch the news closely , you 'll see our @entity1 leaders making the classic mistakes that bad negotiators make			1
you 'll see when they should be changing direction , doing b instead of @entity30 and you 'll be improving your own negotiation skills along the way			1
i 'm totally serious here : as you watch , notice what they should be doing , instead of what they are doing , and it 's likely that you 'll act more effectively when you have to negotiate a new house , a big sale , or a pay increase to cover the increase in your taxes if lawmakers drive over the edge			1
over the past 20 years , i 've helped organizations of all kinds negotiate the sale of companies , contracts for c - suite executives , and union - management agreements			1
i 've also taught negotiation techniques to members of law enforcement -- many @entity58 teams and their federal counterparts			1
here 's what i can tell you : negotiation has three steps and three rules			1
let 's look at what should be happening in @entity1			2
say what you want and ask the people on other side what they want			2
what results is " positions " -- what each side says it wants			1
you tell the car dealer that you 'd like $ 5,000 more for your trade - in than you really think you can get			1
it 's not what you expect , but it 's a way to start the negotiation			1
opinion : beware the fiscal cliff deniers the first serious set of positions came out from @entity86 on december 3			1
the @entity87 got there a bit sooner			2
this step should have been over a couple of days after the election			0
step 2 : one side steps up and asks why the other 's position is what it is , and keeps asking " why " until it gets to core values			1
do n't laugh , but in the real world it works like this : democrats to @entity86 : " how come ' no tax increases ' is so vital for you ? " republicans to @entity87 : " why is it so important to raise taxes on households making over $ 250,000 ? " these questions " surface " each side 's interests , the reasons behind the positions , as @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 note in their classic " @entity119 : negotiating agreement without giving in			1
" i once worked in a hospital where the nurses insisted on a large percentage increase in their pay			0
stuck at step one , they 'd repeat what they wanted , and the hospital executives would call them greedy and out of touch , often with the press listening			0
the nurses responded that the hospital was run by greedy trolls who only cared about making money			0
things moved forward when someone asked the nurses why that position was so important			0
" it 's about fairness , " they said			0
when the nurses were asked why fairness is so important , they said " respect			0
" they felt disrespected by the process , the various offers , and being kept out of hospital decision - making			1
when they settled , a part of the deal was -- are you sitting down ? -- that they wanted to put in more time , invest more passion and expertise , and have a greater sense of ownership in the hospital			1
opinion : millionaires ' tax bracket would be a smart compromise by the hospital giving them a fair slice of its financial success , through a sort of profit - sharing deal , the nurses did better than they would have done with just the straight percentage increase			1
and they won -- emotionally and financially			0
people will surrender a position if it helps them achieve what they 're really after			0
the hospital executives went through a similar process			0
their position was that the nurses would get no increase			0
why zero ? " market realities " -- salary surveys showing that they were already paid fairly			0
why were market realities important ? because the executives wanted the hospital to be the best in its market , in all respects			0
the core value for the executives was " best of the best			2
" notice the @entity16 ending that results : the executives and nurses both got more than they originally wanted , and both were invested in making it happen			1
research my colleagues and i published found that groups get far better results when decisions are based on values rather than compromise or interests alone			2
step 3 : build a specific plan based on the core values			1
compromise only when core values pull in opposite directions			1
i 'm not talking a grand bargain here , just an agreement that honors the core values of each side			1
i 've seen groups go through this process in an hour , even when the difficulties were more complicated than those facing @entity1			0
here 's the question to address : how do we put together a plan that honors opportunity , growth , fairness , and responsibility ? the plan will have lots of pieces , but lawmakers could get to the skeleton of the plan in half a day			0
president @entity232 said a week			0
i 'm not sure we 'll have a week by the time people decide to do their jobs			0
opinion : how @entity232 can win a deal in @entity1 , what we need is a band of leaders to take the key clamoring politicians off site , without cameras or press conferences			2
@entity245 was meant for such occasions			0
or to keep costs down , how about a conference room at a @entity249 ? once there , they also need to make sure they are honoring the three rules of negotiations : never go in with your hands tied			1
many republicans signed @entity259 's no - tax - hike pledge			2
this puts them in a lose - lose position , and a few are expressing that realization			2
without the ability to negotiate freely , their @entity87 counterparts know republicans are hampered			0
the cure : have every @entity86 revoke his or her pledge , as a few have already done			0
they may still vote for a no - tax deal , but they ca n't negotiate in good faith with that pledge over their heads			1
think of a marriage in crisis			0
the best way to save the situation is to put everything on the table -- including possible divorce -- and then go through the steps i outlined here			0
only by setting their positions down , and moving to the deeper levels , can the people have their best shot at a great outcome			2
ironically , the more you hold to a position , the less likely you are to get it			0
do n't go straight for a compromise			2
the @entity87 get a flag on field here			0
the tone is : " the election is over , now let 's meet in the middle -- you get some of what you want , and we get some of what we want			0
" wrong , dead wrong			0
do n't confuse positions with core values			1
the @entity86 get the penalty flag here			0
" no new taxes " is a position , not a core value			2
people should never compromise on their core values , but they should be prepared to let go of their positions			1
likewise , for @entity87 , " go back to the pre-bush tax rates for the wealthy " is a position , not a core value			2
the core values are far more interesting : growth , opportunity , fairness , and responsibility			1
imagine a bill , signed by the president , that honored those principles , instead of merely cobbling together the demands of both parties			0
everyone wins , and the lawmakers would truly be leaders			0
get out the popcorn and let 's see how close to this fiscal cliff we get			1
with these principles in mind , you will leave the drama with better skills to negotiate your future			0
really , this is n't that hard			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity346 .			1

@entity346 : fiscal cliff negotiations have the cooked - up *suspense* of a @entity16 movie
watch closely if you want to see how not to make a deal ; real negotiation has rules , he says
he says both sides should state positions , then reveal " core values " and build deal from there
@entity346 : do n't go in with hands tied ; do n't confuse positions with core values
