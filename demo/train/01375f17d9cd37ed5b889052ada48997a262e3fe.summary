oh , that pesky history of ours			1
why not just take a big ole ' eraser to it ? smudge out the ugly parts			2
that 's essentially what some @entity9 lawmakers aimed to do this week			1
you may have read about it : an education committee in my home state -- a place with plenty of historical blemishes and oodles of modern - day screw - ups -- actually approved a bill that would rewrite advanced placement @entity23 history classes , potentially eliminating them			1
the cause ? they paint @entity23 in too negative a light			1
to get a full sense of how ludicrous this proposal is , you need to hear straight from its sponsor , @entity32 , a @entity33 state representative from a suburb of @entity35			2
" in essence , we have a new emphasis on what is bad about @entity23 , " @entity32 said in a committee hearing , according to a @entity0 report			1
" ( the new framework ) trades an emphasis on @entity23 's founding principles of constitutional government in favor of robust analyses of gender and racial oppression and class ethnicity and the lives of marginalized people , where the emphasis on instruction is of @entity23 as a nation of oppressors and exploiters			1
" @entity32 's bill , as it was proposed , bars state money from going to @entity62 @entity23 history courses , according to @entity0			1
it also requires the replacement class to cover a number of " founding documents of the @entity23 that contributed to the foundation or maintenance of the representative form of limited government , the free - market economic system and @entity23 exceptionalism			1
" oh , and speeches by @entity74 and @entity75			2
sense a political slant there ? nah			2
the proposal is a major sideshow in a state with some serious educational failings			2
@entity83 ranked @entity9 's educational system 48th out of the 50 states and @entity86 , " with an overall score of 67.6 out of 100 points and a grade of d - plus			1
" a d - plus ! @entity92 - rah ! better cut back on those think - y classes			2
the state 's teachers make , on average , about $ 44,000 per year , according to the @entity96 , which uses stats from the 2012 - 2013 school year			2
the national average is more than $ 56,000			2
@entity32 could use his time to focus on either of these issues -- poor educational performance or low teacher pay -- instead of distracting all of us with this heap of revisionist , partisan nonsense			0
the @entity62 history bill itself is being rewritten , the @entity107 reported on wednesday			1
and @entity32 apparently has backed off wanting to kill @entity62 @entity23 history altogether			1
but , i 'm sorry			0
that 's almost beside the point			0
what bothers me is that @entity32 had the gall to propose something so ludicrous in the first place			0
doing so makes my home state -- a place i 'm immensely proud of -- look ridiculous			0
it wastes my time and yours			0
and , more to the point , it flies arrogantly in the face of history			1
@entity23 history -- despite what @entity32 or those @entity33 at the @entity127 might say -- is anything but crisp , clean and " exceptional			1
" this is one of the greatest countries on @entity132 , to be sure			0
we have freedoms of speech and religion that are unmatched worldwide			0
but we are not perfect			0
we have to acknowledge that			0
it 's the only way we can move forward			0
the only way we prevent history from repeating itself			1
@entity9 -- @entity32 and his fringe cohorts aside -- has proven to be good at this			1
@entity35 was the site of one of the worst terror attacks in this country 's history , the 1995 bombing of the @entity150			1
an @entity23 , @entity151 , was executed for that crime			1
now , the city has a beautiful memorial in tribute to the victims of that tragedy			0
it has a museum decrying hate			0
it cherishes the " survivor tree , " a beautiful @entity163 , which withstood that 1995 blast and now serves as a symbol of the city 's and the state 's resilience in the face of hardship			0
you ca n't erase those memories , and @entity173 would n't want to			0
the same goes for the " robust analyses of gender and racial oppression and class ethnicity and the lives of marginalized people " that the @entity9 rep seems so bothered by			1
this is a country that remains ensnared by all those things			0
we ca n't close our eyes and plug our ears			0
we 're still tangled in the awful legacy of slavery and the racism that 's followed			2
the @entity192 marched @entity193 into present day @entity9 , and it 's not such a distant cultural memory , especially there			1
nationwide , women still are n't paid as much as men for the same work			0
and there are still 13 states where gay and lesbian people are n't allowed to be married -- and 29 , including @entity9 , according to the @entity201 , where they can be fired because of their sexual orientation			1
these injustices are historic -- and they 're now			2
you 'd think we 'd get that			0
but apparently it bears repeating			0
so , i guess , does this : we have to learn from these mistakes in order to move forward			0
sweeping them aside in favor of preaching " exceptionalism " in the classroom is n't just ignorant -- it 's dangerous			1
instead of rewriting history we should learn from it			2
and write a better future .			0

@entity9 lawmaker proposes rewrite of @entity23 history class
