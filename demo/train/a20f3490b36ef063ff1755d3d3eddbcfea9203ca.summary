-- @entity1 has learned plenty in the 21 years since he was last captain of the @entity5 ' @entity4 golf team			1
but there is one new - fangled invention the eight - time major winner ca n't quite get his head around			1
@entity1 does in fact have his own @entity12 account with almost 59,000 followers , but he 's a social media novice compared to the likes of current @entity17 stars @entity18 and @entity19 -- posting just over 100 times in 21 months			1
" i 've learned that it 's very difficult to tweet , " the 65 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity22 show ahead of the biennial tussle between @entity24 and the @entity5 at @entity25 in @entity26 this week			1
" i ca n't get my fingers to do it fast enough or put the right hashtag -- it 's hard to do stuff like that			0
" it will also be a tall order to wrest the @entity4 from @entity24 grasp -- the subject of his first official tweet back in january 2013			1
whereas once golf 's most enduring team contest was a virtual @entity5 whitewash , now it is their continental cousins who rule supreme			1
the @entity5 has won just one @entity4 since 1999 , and last time out in 2012 suffered a humbling that became known as the " @entity46 " when @entity24 somehow overturned a 10 - 6 deficit on an exhilarating final day			1
what better skipper to have at the helm , then , than @entity1 , who won three and drew one of his four appearances as a player , and was the last man to mastermind a @entity5 triumph on @entity24 soil back in 1993 ? with a new - look team containing three rookies , the five - time @entity58 winner is the ideal man to school his newbies in the process of handling unprecedented levels of pressure			1
" being a captain , i 'm a stage manager , " @entity1 says of his role as captain			1
" i try to provide everything the players need -- from the physical part but also the mental part			0
the mental part is important , to keep the players positive			0
" make them understand that i understand what they are going through			0
be a go - to guy if they have something they need to talk about under the high pressure situation of a @entity4			2
" it 's the highest pressure , i think , in all of golf			0
there are situations where you may get above your pressure level and since i 've been there before i can be a go - to guy to talk to the players about that			2
" the task facing @entity1 is clear -- just take a glance at golf 's rankings			1
three of the top five players in the world are in the @entity24 ranks -- the only @entity5 is veteran @entity99 at no. 4 -- and the continent has four straight @entity4 victories to its name on home turf			1
no doubt @entity1 will be reminding his players of the last time he donned the captain 's robes , when he led the @entity5 to a 15 - 13 victory over @entity24 at the @entity109 in @entity110 over two decades ago			1
" we go into the @entity4 and on paper the @entity24 look better without question , " @entity1 says			1
" the @entity114 , the @entity115 , the @entity116 , the @entity117 , are players who 've really played well throughout the summer			0
" right now on paper we are underdogs , but things can change			0
we all go through good stretches and we all go through bad stretches			0
" the thing that we bring to it is an underlying @entity5 spirit that we get the job done , no matter what it takes			1
that 's the attitude that i have and the attitude i 'll project to the players			0
" the @entity24 charge will be spearheaded by the hottest player on the planet at present -- @entity135			2
the @entity136 captured half of the majors on offer in 2014 -- adding a second @entity140 to a maiden @entity142 @entity58 title -- to take his career tally to four			0
the 24 - year - old is fully aware that as @entity24 's leading star he is going to be targeted by those in stars and stripes , the logic being that if you take down a team 's top talent , the rest will crumble			1
after his @entity5 @entity140 victory at @entity156 -- scene of the @entity5 's last @entity4 win in 2008 -- @entity135 said he was ready to be the @entity24 " talisman " and drive his side forward			1
@entity1 is a big admirer of the undisputed world no. 1			2
" one of the things i love about @entity135 is how he plays the game , " @entity1 said			2
" he plays it a lot like i do			0
he plays it quickly , with the blinders on			0
you do n't see him moan with a bad shot , you do n't see him go bananas with a good shot			0
" he keeps it on a steady keel throughout and i like that about him			0
i like his manners and the way he treats people , the way he respects the game and the people around him			0
" he 's great for the game of golf and he 's a very formidable competitor			0
i do n't wish him too well in a @entity4 , i can say that , but i wish him well in other events			0
" one of the biggest questions the @entity5 team will face is whether they will suffer any kind of hangover from that chastening experience at @entity191 in 2012			1
under the leadership of @entity193 , the @entity5 had assumed a seemingly unassailable lead ahead of sunday 's singles matches , storming into a four - point advantage			1
it could have been even better , but for @entity198 , who compiled an astonishing run of five birdies in his last five holes to rescue a point for @entity24 in saturday 's final fourballs match			2
captain @entity204 's decision to front - load his singles lineup on sunday then paid instant dividends as @entity24 won the first five matches , including @entity209 's pivotal late victory over @entity5 stalwart @entity210			1
" i watched ( 2012 ) with glee the first two days then with a huge whole in my stomach after we lost on that sunday , " @entity1 recalls			2
" it lasted for several days that week -- it was physical			0
it was a very disappointing loss			0
" but i have to give credit to the @entity24 team , they were 25 under par collectively on sunday ; we were eight under par. " but it still boiled down , even to a five - point lead , to one stroke of the putter by @entity209 on 17 which basically turned the match around			1
" with @entity230 missing through injury , @entity210 will be one of the lynchpins of @entity1 's 2014 team			1
the 44 - year - old has featured in the last eight @entity235 , stretching back to 1995 , and brings with him an invaluable wealth of experience			2
and while his golfing prowess is the major weapon in @entity210 's armory , his sharp wit gets the team going			2
" one of the things i 've done is talk to pretty much all the @entity4 captains of the past and they 've all said @entity210 is really good in the team room , getting people jazzed up , pumped up , " @entity1 says			1
" as a captain , i want the team room to be jokes going back and forth -- that helps with the nerves and @entity210 really does help that way			2
" one of the great things about @entity210 , he loves to gamble so when he 's playing golf there 's always something on the line			0
" you want somebody like that not only play for your team but also talk to the other players			0
@entity210 has that gambler mentality -- he can do anything he wants to do on the golf course , and @entity210 does			0
" after two defeats in a row , and five reverses out of the last six , some have questioned whether the @entity5 team has the desire to wrestle the @entity4 back across the @entity275			1
but @entity1 has no such concerns			2
" there 's no issues about motivation -- they are all motivated to win the cup back , " he says			0
" we 're tired of getting beat , and very simply they look at 2012 when the @entity24 made that great run and came from behind as something they want to make amends for			2
" they want to prove to the world they can play			0
