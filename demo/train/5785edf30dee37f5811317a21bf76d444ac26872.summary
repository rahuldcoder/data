@entity0 -- the @entity2 has concluded @entity3 can execute a @entity5 man sentenced to death for murder , ending an unusual capital appeal that pitted president @entity9 against his home state in a dispute over federal authority , local sovereignty and foreign treaties			1
the case decided by the @entity2 on tuesday pitted president @entity9 against his home state , @entity3			1
the 6 - 3 vote tuesday means the pending execution of @entity19 can proceed			2
he faces lethal injection for two brutal slayings			0
at issue was whether the state had to give in to a demand by the president that the prisoner be allowed new hearings and sentencing			2
@entity9 made that demand reluctantly after an international court concluded @entity30 was improperly denied access to his consulate before his original prosecution , a violation of a treaty signed by the @entity36 decades ago			1
chief justice @entity37 wrote the majority opinion saying the international court " is not domestic law , " thereby restricting the president 's power over states			1
" the executive 's narrow and strictly limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement can not stretch so far as to support the current presidential memorandum " that would force @entity3 to conduct a new state trial , he wrote			1
@entity19 was 18 when he participated in the june 1993 gang rape and murder of two @entity52 , @entity3 , girls : @entity54 , 14 , and @entity55 , 16			1
he was convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death			0
@entity19 's lawyers argued he was not informed upon his arrest of his right to contact @entity5 consular officials			1
those officials were never able to meet with him until after his conviction			0
about 43 other @entity5 nationals awaiting execution in various states -- including 13 in @entity3 -- also will be affected by the high court ruling			1
only @entity70 has commuted a capital inmate 's sentence to life in prison in response to the international judgment			0
the @entity5 government filed an appeal against the @entity36 with the @entity79 in january 2003 , alleging violations of international law			1
@entity19 filed his own federal and state appeals based on similar complaints as well as a claim of ineffective counsel			2
@entity19 has the support of the @entity88 and several international human rights groups			1
the @entity79 ruled in 2004 the @entity36 had violated the rights of the @entity5 prisoners , in part because officials and prosecutors failed to notify their home countries , which could have provided legal and other assistance			2
the @entity79 judges ordered the @entity36 to provide " review and reconsideration " of the sentences and convictions of the @entity5 prisoners			2
the court is based in @entity103 , @entity104 , and resolves disputes between nations over treaty obligations			0
the @entity36 is one of the signatories to the 1963 @entity110 , laying out rights of people detained in other nations			0
the case turned on what role each branch of government plays to give force to international treaty obligations			2
@entity37 concluded international court judgments can not be forced upon individual states			1
the president can not " establish binding rules of decision that pre-empt contrary state law , " he said , and the treaty does not specifically require states to remedy any treaty violations			0
the chief justice was supported in his position by justices @entity131 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0
in dissent , justice @entity137 said the presidential memorandum in this case was " self - executing , " and warned , " the nation may well break its word even though the president seeks to live up to that word and @entity144 has done nothing to suggest the contrary			0
" he was supported by justice @entity147 and @entity148			0
justice @entity131 , who normally opposes the use of the death penalty , agreed with his conservative colleagues in this case			0
but he suggested the legal responsibility now falls on the state to give @entity30 a fresh hearing , calling it a " modest cost of compliance			1
" " @entity3 ' duty in this respect is all the greater since it was @entity3 that -- by failing to provide consular notice in accordance with the @entity163 -- ensnared the @entity36 in the current controversy			0
having put the nation in breach of one treaty , it is now up to @entity3 to prevent breach of another			0
" lawyers for the administration and @entity19 argued @entity9 properly exercised his unilateral executive authority , which a majority of justices had questioned in oral arguments last september			1
the @entity5 government filed an appeal with the @entity79 against the @entity36 in january 2003 , alleging violations of international law			2
@entity19 filed his own federal and state appeals based on similar complaints , as well as a claim of ineffective counsel			0
@entity19 has the support of the @entity88 and several international human rights groups			2
@entity9 said he disagreed with the international court 's conclusions but agreed to comply with them			1
in a february 28 , 2005 , executive order , he said , " the @entity36 will discharge its international obligations ... by having state courts give effect to the decision			0
" but a @entity3 appeals court later rejected that executive authority			2
in a sharply worded opinion , judge @entity201 concluded the president 's " unprecedented , unnecessary , and intrusive exercise of power over the @entity3 court system can not be supported by the foreign policy authority conferred on him by the @entity200			1
" the @entity200 does not directly give the president the power to enforce the treaties agreed to by the @entity36			0
however , @entity210 says that " all treaties made ... under the authority of the @entity36 shall be the supreme law of the land , and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby			0
" lawyers for the administration and @entity19 argued @entity9 properly exercised his unilateral executive authority , which several justices had questioned in oral arguments last september			1
@entity3 solicitor general @entity220 told the high court the president 's action was " a very curious assertion of presidential authority , " saying it " singles out the states , commandeers those judges			1
" the @entity228 typically backs states in their power to carry out executions , but @entity233 officials said that in these instances , the president 's power to conduct foreign policy outweighed states ' interests			0
the @entity2 originally heard the @entity30 case in 2005 but did not rule on the merits , waiting instead for lower courts to resolve the federalism angle			1
