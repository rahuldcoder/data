-- lawyers painted opposing pictures of @entity4 athlete @entity3 in their final arguments friday before his sentencing -- one side depicting him as a broken man who 's suffered enough , while the other said he must pay for taking his girlfriend 's life			1
@entity3 , 27 , is due to be sentenced for culpable homicide , or negligent killing , as well as one weapons - related charge , after a hearing lasting several days			1
after both sides ' final arguments concluded friday , @entity17 said the court would reconvene tuesday for sentencing			1
defense lawyer @entity22 appealed to the judge to remember that he reacted as a vulnerable disabled man when he shot @entity25 dead			1
the evidence presented in court demonstrated that as a double amputee , @entity3 ' negligent actions in the shooting could not be seen outside the context of his disability , he said			1
he did not act unlawfully , but out of fear , @entity22 said			1
there is no reason to doubt that @entity3 believed there was an intruder in the bathroom who posed a threat to him and to @entity25 when he fired the fatal shots through the toilet door , @entity22 said			1
" whatever way you see it , the accused 's actions were in some way dominated by vulnerability and anxiety , " he said			0
" it 's a compromised person doing that			0
" a sentence of imprisonment should be a last resort , and a combination of other options should be considered , he argued			1
" it can never be a suitable punishment , " he said of a prison term			2
whatever punishment is handed down , the athlete could not suffer more than in the past 18 months , when he was denigrated , shamed and blamed , on top of losing the woman he loved , @entity22 said			1
@entity3 is now a " broken man , " he said , who has lost everything he once had			1
the athlete at times appeared emotional as he sat with his head bowed while the arguments were made over his fate			0
@entity25 's parents , @entity72 and june , listened impassively in the benches nearby			0
@entity3 ' sentence -- whether imprisonment or not -- will be decided by judge @entity17 , who also presided over his trial			1
prosecutor : ' he 's not a victim ' state prosecutor @entity79 , famed for his bulldog tenacity in cross-examinations during the trial , called for a minimum prison sentence of 10 years in his final arguments			1
this , he said , would be " the minimum term that society will be happy with			0
" " this is a serious matter , " he said			0
" the negligence borders on intent			0
ten years is the minimum			2
" he recalled the testimony of @entity25 's cousin , @entity94 , who made an emotional appeal for the court to make @entity3 pay with prison for what he did to @entity25 and her family			1
his disabilities had already been taken into account in deciding the verdict , @entity100 said			0
he said it was right that the court was shown a bloody photograph of what happened to @entity25 when she was hit by three of the four bullets fired from @entity3 ' high - powered handgun			1
" it 's not an accused that had a gun with normal ammunition that every other person had , it was devastating , damaging @entity117 ammunition , " he said			0
a reasonable man would have known the consequences of firing that ammunition into a small toilet cubicle , he said , recalling that the judge found in her verdict that @entity3 acted negligently , too hastily and with excessive force			1
@entity3 wanted to use the firearm , he said			1
" he 's not a victim , " he said of the athlete			0
" he can not be a victim -- he caused it			0
" the victims in the case are @entity25 and her parents , who had to receive a phone call with the news any parent would dread , he said			0
says correctional supervision not appropriate @entity100 told the court that the sentence of correctional supervision -- as suggested by the defense -- is not appropriate in this case			1
he said it would not be fair if @entity3 were to live in a luxurious house , get to run track , go to the doctor and then do two days a month of community service			2
this would be shockingly disproportionate to the crime , he said			0
he read from case law that said society might lose its trust in the system if a lenient sentence is given			0
and he accused the defense of " only paying lip service " to the gravity of the offense in asking for correctional supervision			2
if @entity3 had not acted as he did , @entity25 would be alive today , he said			2
@entity3 did not have railings in his shower at home , @entity100 said , as he rejected defense arguments that the accused could not be accommodated properly in prison			1
he suggested that @entity3 was using his disability " on call			2
" @entity100 also dismissed @entity3 ' offers of financial aid to @entity25 's family			2
june @entity25 referred to that money as " blood money , " he reminded the court			2
the court this week heard that the athlete had offered the money to @entity25 's parents , but they had decided to reject it			2
they will also pay back a monthly payment he had been making to them			0
@entity100 also suggested that any appeal for mercy by @entity3 was undeserved			2
the interests of the victims far outweigh the personal circumstances of the accused , he said , as he scoffed at the fact that @entity3 could have made millions were it not for the shooting			2
' he 's lost everything ' by contrast , in his final arguments , @entity22 presented a picture of a " broken man " who has already suffered enough			1
@entity22 said @entity3 should never have been accused of premeditated murder , a charge of which he was cleared at trial			1
after the charge , @entity3 was subjected to a trial by media , he said			2
@entity22 also argued that he should not have been shown that gruesome picture of the woman he loved while in court			1
" he never , ever even considered that it was @entity25 behind that door , " @entity22 said			1
the athlete has fully accepted the court 's verdict and shown remorse , he said			0
" he 's lost everything			0
he was an icon in the eyes of @entity4 , " @entity22 said			2
" on what he has done , what he has achieved , he was denigrated to such an extent that all that was left was a raged killer , a cold - blooded killer , a liar and everything that 's horrible			0
" he lost all his sponsors , he lost all his money			0
he has nothing , my lady			0
he has n't even money to pay for legal expenses			0
" he sold his last asset , his car , not to try to get a better sentence but to try to make good by helping the @entity25 family , @entity22 said , also citing @entity3 ' past charitable work			1
@entity22 reminded the court that the @entity233 have said they are neutral as far as sentencing is concerned and do not seek vengeance			1
@entity22 said the testimony of acting national commissioner of correctional services @entity237 that @entity3 ' disability could be accommodated in the hospital section of a prison did not make it an appropriate place for him to be held			1
judge to decide sentence there is no legal minimum sentence for culpable homicide in @entity4 law , so it will be down to the judge 's discretion			0
a typical sentence is five to eight years			0
but it is a principle of @entity4 law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person , as opposed to the crime			0
that makes predicting a sentence difficult , said @entity260 , a @entity0 legal analyst			0
the judge also found @entity3 guilty of one weapons - related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant			1
the maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars			0
but he could get a lesser sentence , such as a fine or the loss of his gun license .			0
