-- democrats and @entity2 woke up this week with a fresh perspective on the midterm elections			1
to many political observers , the election of @entity2 @entity6 is a game changer			1
he overcame what at one point was a 30 - point deficit to defeat @entity13 @entity12 in a special election to serve out the remainder of the late @entity18 's @entity17 term			0
@entity1 are trying to calm frustrated voters and make sure that recent losses in @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 do n't become a national trend			1
republicans , still jubilant from last week 's win , are hoping to capitalize on the excitement brewing from a refueled base			2
" as a @entity31 fan , i think of the great song ' @entity33 , ' and really for republicans right now , we think if we can make it there in @entity21 and @entity22 , we can make it anywhere , " @entity2 strategist @entity29 said			1
" there 's no state in the union right now that @entity2 do n't feel that they can be competitive in			1
" the passion awakened in @entity2 could put democrats at a disadvantage as the midterm elections near , experts say			1
" the problems for the @entity1 will be remobilizing the enthusiasm that they had in 2008 , and i think that is a serious problem			0
right now , the @entity2 have the advantage of strong emotions , and that tends to pull their people to the polls , whereas weak emotions do not , " said @entity50 , director of the committee for the @entity52 at @entity53			1
dr. @entity60 , a psychology professor at @entity61 who specializes in voting behavior , said voters start from an emotional perspective and then get rational			0
" if you can grab them emotionally , i think you 've gone a long way toward getting them where you want them to be , voting either @entity13 or @entity2 , " said @entity60 , who is also the director of research for the @entity66 @entity61			1
president @entity72 rode into the @entity73 on a compelling message of change , inspiring his base while also winning over independent voters			2
but a year after his inauguration , polls suggest that much of the excitement that followed him has disappeared			0
are you an independent voter ? tell us why a @entity85 survey released this month found that 39 percent of @entity1 say they 're extremely or very enthusiastic about voting this year , down 11 points from november			0
forty - nine percent of @entity2 questioned in the poll say they 're enthusiastic , up 6 points			1
" [ @entity1 ] will try to mobilize more voters , but you have to overcome the enthusiasm gap			0
the best grassroots , ground operation will only work if the territory is fertile , " @entity50 said			0
he predicted the economy will be the most important issue in the midterms			2
the @entity72 administration has said it plans to emphasize job growth both in this week 's @entity103 address and in the months to come			0
" he had a year in which he could blame the @entity106 administration for not dealing with the economic problems			0
the economy is now his baby , as @entity111 is his baby , " @entity50 said			0
but republicans ca n't get too carried away			2
if they swing too far to the right , they run the risk of alienating independent voters like those who swung the @entity21 election for @entity6			1
" if the ' birthers ' and the @entity123 people win most of the primaries in the @entity2 , that may not yield as much of a @entity2 victory in the general election as if their more moderate elements win , " he said			1
this scenario played out last year in a special election for @entity131 's 23rd @entity130			0
local @entity2 leaders backed state assemblywoman @entity133 because they thought she would appeal to centrists and independents			1
but more conservative party members revolted and instead backed @entity137 , who ran on the @entity139 line			0
@entity133 dropped out days before the race and endorsed @entity141 , the @entity1 candidate and eventual winner			0
the split among @entity2 contributed to @entity145 ' win			1
a similar battle could take place in @entity148 , where @entity149 gov. @entity149 and former state house speaker @entity150 are competing to be their party 's nominee for the @entity17 race			0
@entity149 has the backing of mainstream republicans , and @entity150 is the darling of the right			2
" @entity150 has the enthusiasm of the birthers and the @entity123 people and others like that , and that may propel him to the nomination , but it will be harder for the @entity2 to win in @entity148 under @entity150 than it would be under a more moderate person , " @entity50 said			1
going ahead , both parties need to clarify their messages and why their strategies are the best options in order to engage voters , @entity60 said			1
" what the @entity1 have to do is get off the defensive if they want to win and start packaging themselves in a more positive light			0
... they need to not only say , ' this is what we are going to do because it is right , ' but ' those guys over there do n't want us to do that ' and paint [ the @entity2 ] as bad guys			2
" in turn , the @entity2 have to keep doing what they 're doing , which is , ' they 're leading you astray , we 're the ones who have the right idea			2
@entity0 's @entity193 contributed to this report .			0

republicans energized after upset in @entity21
" republicans have the advantage of strong emotions , " expert says
@entity2 could hurt chances in midterms if primaries go to more extreme candidates , expert says
both parties need to clarify message , show why the other is *wrong* , psychologist says
