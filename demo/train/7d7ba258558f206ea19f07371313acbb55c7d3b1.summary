-- if anyone wondered about @entity5 's @entity4 - winning credentials , surely there can be little doubt now			1
not because of the convincing nature of the team 's football thus far mind you -- far from it			2
but after a solitary goal from @entity13 was enough to overcome @entity14 in @entity15 on saturday , " @entity5 " are only one game away from the final of this gripping @entity4			1
the win also marked the first time @entity5 has reached a @entity4 semifinal since 1990 , when -- after overcoming host nation @entity21 on penalties -- it was eventually defeated by @entity24 in a bad - tempered final			1
that came four years after @entity27 inspired the country 's second title success in football 's showpiece event , in @entity32 , following victory on home soil in 1978			0
" after 24 years this is a good tribute to this squad -- they will go down in history as one of the best four teams in the world and we will see if they can go one step more , " coach @entity35 told reporters			0
while @entity47 will be without injured star striker @entity48 for tuesday 's semifinal against @entity24 -- and the rest of the tournament if the host goes any further -- the @entity46 have their own fitness concerns after trumping a @entity55 team tipped as a pre-tournament dark horse			0
@entity57 , who scored @entity5 's winning goal in the previous round , is a doubt for wednesday 's match against the @entity62 -- which beat @entity63 in a penalty shootout later saturday -- after coming off with a thigh injury in the first half			1
nevertheless , they will be glad to be through			0
@entity35 's team had struggled in the group stage , requiring a dramatic late strike from @entity71 to overcome unfancied @entity72 and only narrowly defeating @entity73 and @entity74			0
an uncomfortable extra-time victory over @entity76 in the round of 16 also hardly inspired confidence			0
yet such worries seem pointless when a team has the likes of @entity71 in its ranks			0
the @entity84 star has finally announced his arrival on the @entity4 stage in @entity47 after a disappointing 2010 tournament in @entity88 and only a few substitute appearances as a 17 - year - old in @entity24 four years prior			1
@entity71 had scored four goals in four games coming in to this encounter , as well as providing a fantastic dribbling assist for @entity95 to secure victory over @entity76			0
" i felt he played a wonderful match , " @entity35 said			0
" it 's not only scoring goals , it 's having possession , taking out three opponents , and every move he makes is a sign of hope for us and endangers our opponents			0
" that a player like @entity71 almost never loses the ball is water in the desert -- he gives us that water in the desert			0
" today when the terrain was dry he gave us that breath of fresh air every time he had the ball			0
" but @entity14 has talent of its own , a golden generation even			1
with genuinely top - class players such as @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 in the squad , this was a quality of opposition @entity5 had yet to face this tournament			1
perhaps aware of this , the @entity130 looked sharp from the off , backed by a considerable support in the stands , bouncing and singing in the early afternoon sun. a glorious @entity71 pass early on almost gave the fans something more to shout about , but @entity139 's cross could n't find @entity13 in the center			1
however , the @entity142 striker would not be denied shortly after			0
@entity143 lost possession as he stepped out of defense and when @entity57 's deflected pass found @entity13 , he swiveled to strike the ball in to the corner of @entity125 ' net from just outside the penalty area			1
it was a fine instinctive finish from a man who had failed to find the net all tournament before this game , and it drew him level with @entity71 on five @entity4 career goals			1
@entity14 sought a quick response			2
@entity159 -- who netted the opening goal against the @entity161 in the last 16 -- fired a shot high and wide from roughly 30 yards out after 13 minutes and once more shortly after which @entity163 did well to push away in the @entity5 goal			1
@entity5 suffered a blow after 33 minutes as @entity57 went down clutching his thigh			2
the @entity169 winger looked in considerable pain as he left the field but was able to take a place alongside his teammates on the bench to watch the remainder of the game			2
@entity71 then went close from a free - kick just before halftime after the ever - unsubtle @entity179 had made four clear attempts to bring down the illusive striker			0
the second half began much like the first had ended , with @entity5 carving out the better chances			1
@entity13 nutmegged @entity126 to put himself through on @entity125 ' goal but just when it looked like he was about to double the @entity46 advantage , the crossbar came to the rescue of the despairing goalkeeper			1
again @entity14 looked to respond , bringing on @entity190 for the ineffective @entity191 -- who in the group stage was the first teenager to score at a @entity4 since @entity71 -- and @entity194 for @entity195			1
with the @entity5 defense being organized by the experienced pair of @entity200 and @entity201 , the @entity55 ' best chance of success looked like it would come from a set - piece rather than open play			2
@entity179 made a nuisance of himself on numerous occasions , pushing , bullying and harassing as defenders at corners and free - kicks			0
however an inability to follow the offside rule repeatedly frustrated the @entity212			0
@entity14 had n't scored a goal earlier than the 70th minute in this tournament but as the game progressed , coach @entity215 became ever more desperate on the sidelines			1
" we were not impressed by the @entity46 , they were just an ordinary team , " said the former @entity14 international			2
" they can distort the rhythm , they take 30 seconds to take a throw - in and the referee does n't do anything			0
if i played that way i would have been destroyed by the @entity14 press			2
" seeking a lifeline , @entity215 pushed veteran defender @entity228 -- likely playing his last game before retirement -- forward to operate as an auxiliary striker			2
but it was @entity5 which came closest to scoring again , though @entity71 was unable to add to his 2014 tournament tally of four as the onrushing figure of @entity125 blocked his dinked strike on the counter attack			2
@entity14 scrambled forward one final time but when @entity239 's ambitious long range effort flew over , @entity5 could celebrate .			1

@entity5 defeats @entity14 to reach @entity4 semifinals
@entity13 scores only goal of game early in first half
@entity5 will next face either @entity63 or the @entity62
