-- @entity1 led an early morning assault by the world 's best golfers on a toothless @entity5 thursday to claim the first round lead at the @entity7 with @entity8 also making a promising start to his first major of the season			1
@entity12 's @entity1 carded six birdies in a pretty much flawless first round of six - under 66 on the @entity16 seaside links , missing several other opportunities as he peppered the flags with his approach shots			1
warm weather conditions and negligible winds , particularly for morning starters like @entity1 , saw a clutch of stars break 70 , including @entity8 , who opened with a three - under - par 69			1
playing on his second tournament since late march after back surgery , @entity8 looked rusty on the front nine as he slipped one over , but a hat - trick of birdies on the back nine saw him finish with a spring in his step			1
woods won the @entity7 in 2006 when it was last held at @entity5 , but has been stuck on 14 major victories since 2008			1
@entity1 has two majors to his name , but will be hoping his habit of following up a strong opening with a poor second round will not rear its head again			1
in the @entity38 at @entity39 he led with a 63 and followed it up with an 80 , while at last week 's @entity41 backed up a 64 with a 78 to slip off the pace			2
" we had perfect scoring conditions out there this morning			0
there was n't much wind early on			2
there were plenty of opportunities to make birdies and i was able to take a few of them , " he told the official @entity50 @entity7 website			1
" i 'm looking forward to getting back out there tomorrow , " added the 25 - year - old former world number one			2
@entity59 was another young golfer to take advantage of the calm conditions , the 21 - year - old chasing @entity1 on five - under after a 67			1
fellow @entity63 and @entity64 were among a group on four - under and @entity59 is hoping the challenge will continue			2
" we got off to a fast start , all of us			0
it 's going to be wonderful to have a few @entity70 up there on sunday afternoon			0
it 's going to be fun if there is , " he said			0
that group also included @entity77 @entity76 and veteran @entity78 as well as @entity79 of @entity80			0
@entity79 , still to win that elusive first major , acknowledged that early conditions were kind			1
" difficult to get a nicer day to play golf than today and if you manage to play well , even better ! ! " he tweeted			0
late on , world number one @entity85 joined them on 68 , one of the few afternoon starters to make a run at @entity1 as the wind picked up a little , with scores on average three shots higher than the morning players			2
2012 winner @entity94 was among those to struggle , missing two putts from inside a foot on the opening hole for a triple bogey seven and never recovered his composure with a seven - over 79			0
defending champion @entity101 , @entity102 champion @entity102 and last week 's @entity104 winner @entity103 were also affected by the worsening conditions			0
@entity101 slipped to a two - over 74 after going out of bounds at the last , while @entity102 tripled bogeyed the 11th on the way to a wayward 76			0
home hope @entity108 stayed in contention with a level - par 72 -- on a day 49 players broke par.			0

@entity1 sets early pace at @entity7
cards a six - under 66 at @entity5
@entity8 begins with fine round of 69
