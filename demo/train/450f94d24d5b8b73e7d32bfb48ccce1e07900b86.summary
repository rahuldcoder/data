-- @entity3 pop star @entity1 , who stars in " @entity5 , " releasing nationwide on wednesday , has all the trimmings of an international superstar in the making			1
his talent , good looks and charming swagger have captured the devotion of the @entity14 continent , where tickets to his concerts evaporate in minutes			1
he was hailed as one of @entity20 's most beautiful two years ago , and , despite being relatively unknown to most @entity21 , beat @entity22 in a @entity23 online poll of most influential people in 2007			1
yet @entity1 's climb from unknown backup dancer to a member of @entity14 's a-list was n't easy : his lack of @entity32 features caused many music labels to look right past him and getting his footing in the @entity21 has been particularly difficult			1
despite having six albums under his belt and selling out a two - day @entity39 tour in 2006 , @entity1 's " @entity35 meets @entity44 " brand of bubble - gum pop never saturated pop charts here as it did in the @entity43			2
but @entity1 is n't one to accept defeat			0
" the more criticism i get , the more it gives me a stronger urge to win			0
so i try harder , " he told @entity0 's @entity51			0
" the more times i was turned down , the more i believed i was getting closer to making it			0
a lot of people in @entity56 say that failure is the mother of success , so i believed that more times i failed , the more likely i was to succeed , " he said			0
the 27 - year - old tested @entity63 waters with last year 's " @entity64 , " but the action film , which he now calls a " warming up period , " failed to give him cross-over recognition			1
now , @entity1 has a second shot at swimming in the @entity21 mainstream with another @entity69 produced film , the cut ' em and gut ' em " @entity5 , " where the pop star does most of his own stunts			1
" i put my heart and soul into this movie , " he said			0
rain trained hard for months to get ready for the movie 's slick violence			1
" for about a year , i could n't eat properly , i was working out from 7 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon , " he said			2
" i went through a lot of pain in my efforts to get 100 percent close to the character that i was playing			0
" to get the opportunity to finally become an @entity21 household name , though , it 's worth it			1
after all , @entity1 is n't the type of guy who shies away from a challenge			0
" what i want to do now is start from the bottom again and build up a name in the @entity21 , " @entity1 said			2
" i experienced firsthand what it means to be poor , what it means to go hungry , and that i think may be the reason , the root cause of why i 'm able to work so hard even these days , " he said			2
" i 'm hoping people expect a lot from this movie , because i think they will not be disappointed			0
