@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a recent chilly @entity1 morning , @entity3 sat at her kitchen table and looked through her son @entity8 's baby clothes			1

@entity3 took him to the doctor			2
the doctor told her to give @entity8 an over-the - counter infant cold and cough medicine			1
@entity3 followed the doctor 's directions and gave @entity8 the suggested amount			2
however , a few mornings later when the @entity0 , @entity1 , mother checked on her son , something was wrong			2

" my heart fell out of my chest			2
i could n't believe it , " says @entity13			2
" no one in my family ever died this way			0
at first , investigators blamed @entity48 for @entity8 's death			0
but @entity13 and her family were not convinced , so they pushed for more tests			0
" i 'm a technical person , " says @entity13			0
" i know that there 's a cause and effect for everything , and i knew that there was something that caused this baby to die			0
" a few months later , the results came back			0
the cause of death : dextromethorphan intoxication			0

last week , in advance of the hearings , some of the leading manufacturers of cold and cough medicines announced a voluntary recall of more than a dozen cold medicines for infants			1
the @entity117 said the products were being pulled " out of an abundance of caution			0
" potential misuse of the medications , not product safety , is driving the voluntary withdrawal , the group said			1
in a written statement , the group 's president , @entity133 said , " it is important to point out that these medicines are safe and effective when used as directed , and most parents are using them appropriately			0
" the recall " in no way affects our taking this issue to the advisory committee meeting , " said dr. @entity134 , deputy director for the @entity76 's @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137			1
" all potential actions are on the table , " he said			0

indications for their use in children have not been established			0
" since @entity8 's death , his grandmother has been on what she calls a " one - woman crusade			0
" " i 'm the nut that walks up to people in the grocery stores and asked them if they have ever heard of this			0
from her home in a quiet @entity0 neighborhood , @entity13 says she e-mailed comments to the @entity76 and will be watching what happens at the hearings closely			1
