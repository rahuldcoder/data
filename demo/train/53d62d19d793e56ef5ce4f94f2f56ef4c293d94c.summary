@entity0 -- two @entity3 justices on opposite sides of the ideological aisle exchanged tough words monday over the fate of a @entity9 murderer who has been on death row for 32 years			1
siding with the court 's majority , justice @entity11 described brutal details of a @entity9 slaying			1
the high court has refused to hear the appeal of @entity19 , who had plead guilty twice in the march 1976 kidnapping and torture - murder of a woman			1
his case and subsequent appeals have been litigated since , but a new execution date has not been set			2
a key part of his request to be spared lethal injection is that three decades as a capital inmate constitutes cruel and unusual punishment			1
" our experience during the past three decades has demonstrated that delays in state - sponsored killings are inescapable and that executing defendants after such is unacceptably cruel , " said justice @entity32 , who disagreed with the court 's decision to allow the execution to proceed			1
he was supported by justice @entity41 in his objection to the court 's ruling on monday in the case , @entity19 v. @entity46 ( 08 - 7369 )			1
but justice @entity11 took issue with his colleagues ' conclusions			1
" it is the crime and not the punishment imposed by the jury or the delay in execution that was ' unacceptably cruel , ' " he responded			1
@entity11 took time in his concurrence to detail the graphic crime that led to the conviction of @entity19 and his co-defendant			1
the men had held @entity61 and another woman in a motel room and were demanding money from the victim 's families			2
@entity61 had promised she could raise hundreds of dollars but was only able to secure $ 25			0
that enraged the men who savagely beat the woman with a belt , chair leg and nightstick , causing internal injuries			0
she was also burned with cigarettes			0
the other woman witnessed the murder and said she feared for her life if she tried to leave			0
@entity19 and his co-defendant both pleaded guilty but the state 's high court initially tossed out @entity19 's sentence			1
the man 's lawyer had told the defendant if he accepted responsibility for the crime , he would not get the death penalty , a crucial mistake			1
@entity19 later pleaded guilty a second time and again received a capital sentence			2
then he began a series of appeals , claiming ineffective counsel , trial errors , limited mental capacity and a dysfunctional childhood			0
all those factors were ultimately rejected by state and federal courts			0
@entity32 noted that during a third penalty hearing , five members of a state advisory jury recommended against lethal injection , but the court again imposed death			2
the circumstances of his current imprisonment , said @entity32 , no longer justify such a sentence			0
" as he awaits execution , petitioner has endured especially severe conditions of confinement , " said @entity32 , " spending up to 23 hours per day in isolation in a 6 - by 9 - foot cell			0
two death warrants have been signed against him and stayed only shortly before he was scheduled to die			0
the dehumanizing effects of such treatment are undeniable			0
" but @entity11 said all such inmates are subjected to a " restricted confinement " because of the security risks they pose			2
and the prisoner had only himself to blame for his prolonged imprisonment on death row			1
quoting his conclusions from a similar 1999 capital case , @entity11 said , " i remain unaware of any support in the @entity129 constitutional tradition of this @entity3 's precedence for the proposition that a defendant can avail himself of the panoply of appellate and collateral procedures and then complain when his execution is delayed			1
" @entity11 has long backed the right of states to impose death sentences			2
@entity32 , who as a newly seated justice cast a key 1976 vote upholding the death penalty , has since grown increasingly frustrated with how it its carried out			2
last april , he declared his open opposition to it			0
" i have relied on my own experience in reaching the conclusion that the imposition of the death penalty represents the pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes , " he wrote			0
" a penalty with such negligible returns to the state ( is ) patently excessive and cruel and unusual punishment violative of the @entity157			1
" the 88 - year - old justice was supported by three of his more liberal colleagues			0
but @entity32 also said he would respect court precedents in favor of capital punishment .			0
