-- each time your heart beats , your entire body moves -- even if you 're unconscious and pinned under a pile of rubble			1
the vibrations are small , invisible to the human eye , and might just save your life after a major disaster			1
researchers at @entity11 have developed a device that picks up these subtle movements through up to 40 feet of debris			1
called finder ( @entity16 ) , the tool was developed at @entity11 's @entity18 to help rescue crews find survivors quickly in a major disaster			1
" i spend half my time doing space exploration and half building boxes that can search for people in a disaster , " said @entity22 , who created finder at the @entity18			1
@entity11 develops technology for space but frequently finds additional uses for its discoveries here on @entity32			1
after the devastating 2010 earthquake in @entity36 , the @entity34 's science and technology directorate wanted technology they could use in similar situations			1
they reached out to @entity22			0
he had previously worked on a similar device for the @entity43 military , which could tell if a solider downed on the battlefield was dead or alive			1
after a disaster , there 's a limited window of time to find trapped survivors			1
@entity17 makes the process more efficient			0
it uses a low power radio signal to detect motion			1
each movement caused by a heartbeat is like a " twinkle " reflecting back to the radar			0
what makes the system especially smart is software that can cut through all other movements and pinpoint which vibrations are signs of life			0
the system looks just for the signals that match human heartbeats , filtering out slower movements like tree branches in the wind , and faster ones like the heartbeat of a rat			2
it takes about five minutes to learn how to use finder and just a few minutes to set up			2
the device fits into a case small enough to carry on a plane			2
hit the " search " button and 30 seconds later a web page appears on the finder laptop , which shows how many heartbeats it 's found in a 100 foot radius			1
in the @entity43 , infrastructure is solid enough that earthquakes do n't result in the same type of devastation that hit @entity36			2
tornadoes are a bigger problem , like those that flattened parts of @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96 , @entity97			2
" in both cases , they had a wide area with a lot of rubble and no good way to figure out where people were trapped , " said @entity22			2
" it would have been nice to have one of these there -- people were in storm shelters under the pile of a neighbors house			0
" it could also work in avalanches and hurricanes			2
after @entity116 , many people climbed into their attics to escape the rising water and ended up trapped			0
@entity17 would be able to detect heartbeats in similar situations , which could help dictate rescue efforts			1
because disasters rarely announce themselves ahead of time , and only a handful of prototypes are available , finder has n't been used in a real emergency			0
it has been tested by @entity128 task forces and at a training site in @entity130 that is set up to mimic the scene of a natural disaster			0
@entity11 frequently develops cutting - edge technology , but it does n't mass produce or sell it			1
to get these devices into the hands of more emergency response crews , a separate company needs to license the technology and manufacture and sell the gadgets , which would probably sell for about $ 10,000 , said @entity22			0
" what it 's really waiting for is somebody to manufacture it , we ca n't force anybody to make it , " said @entity22 , who thinks the devices will be used in the next year or two			0
until then , @entity22 is working to shrink the finder hardware and mount it on a drone or helicopter			0
then crews could fly the device further into disaster areas that are difficult to reach on foot			1
his team is also working on a variation that could help firefighters determine where people are in a burning building before rushing in			0
" it 's not often you get to use tech developed for deep space and to go out and save lives , " said @entity22			0
how termite - inspired robots could build for us			0

a new device can detect heartbeats of disaster survivors under 40 feet of rubble
called finder , it was created by researchers at @entity11 's @entity18
the device could be used in earthquakes , avalanches and tornadoes
