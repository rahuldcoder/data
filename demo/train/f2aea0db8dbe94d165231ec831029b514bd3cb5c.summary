" my son represents the new @entity2 , " @entity1 , a @entity2 native , recently told @entity0			1
" i will tell him what i had to do and what i grew up with and he 'll understand that now there is no fear			2
may he and that fear never come back			2
" a year ago , the 28 - year - old posted an @entity21 about what it was like to grow up in @entity2 under former president @entity24 @entity18			1
as she wrote , @entity2 was in the throws of a historic revolution , a movement that would spread throughout the @entity28 and @entity29			1
the movement , known as the @entity31 , was born in @entity2 with a street vendor 's self - immolation last year on december 17			1
@entity34 was reportedly pushed to such extraordinary ends after a municipal official and her aides were alleged to have harassed and humiliated him , and confiscated his goods			1
tunisians viewed @entity34 's act to be the ultimate protest against corruption in @entity18 's government that they blamed for high unemployment and a lack of speech and political freedom			1
throngs of @entity2 took to the streets demanding the ouster of @entity18 who became president in 1987			1
following the 28 - day @entity2 revolt that toppled @entity18 , revolt spread in other countries : @entity55 and the ouster of president @entity57			1
the civil war in @entity59 and death of @entity61			2
continued protests in countries such as @entity64 and @entity65			2
and a series of bloody demonstrations in @entity68			1
who 's gone and who 's @entity71 ? " to know that the @entity31 started in @entity2 is just something that warms my heart			1
it fills me with a love of my country that i thought i would not feel because it was so hard there for many years , " @entity1 says			0
" i am so glad that tyrant is gone			0
" @entity18 resigned and fled to @entity80 in middle january 2011			0
a @entity2 military court in late november sentenced him in absentia to five years in prison for his role in a 1991 case in which 17 servicemen were accused of plotting a coup against his regime , the state - run @entity81 reported			1
@entity1 will travel to @entity2 with her baby in late december to celebrate			1
@entity1 has been pursuing a doctorate in mechanical engineering in @entity95 , and was n't in @entity2 for the protests			1
but she communicated frequently on the phone and over @entity99 with her parents during the demonstrations			1
her family lives in the same town where she was raised , in @entity104 , a 15 - minute drive from the presidential palace near @entity107 , the capital			0
she recalled to @entity0 this week the thrilling phone and @entity99 conversations she had with her family when the protests were happening			0
" the first conversation with my family -- we talked for so long because we were so excited , " she recalls			0
" we were just shouting , a lot of relatives jumping in to say something			0
it was odd because there were curfews in @entity104 and @entity107 , and my parents were telling me that the neighbors were protecting their houses because the police were n't working			0
but no one was stealing or hurting each other			0
" @entity1 's father would occasionally interrupt during the calls , afraid that their conversations were being monitored by the government			1
" he would say , ' let 's not talk			2
we should n't , ' " she remembers			0
" and yes , it was scary a little but we were all too excited			0
it was joy , relief , no fear at all			0
" @entity1 said her friends and family say that when @entity18 was ousted , change occurred almost immediately			0
they were small and slow changes in the way people lived , but they were deeply meaningful			0
" my family would say that they heard people talking in the streets and before you just did n't talk to anyone because you did n't want to be overheard saying something against @entity18 , " she says			0
" now you can go to a coffee shop and hear people for the first time talking politics			0
they just talk and talk politics even if they do n't understand it because they are so excited to have this freedom			0
" @entity1 's own family enjoyed these new political freedoms			2
during the october election in @entity2 , she supported one party while her parents supported another and they often talked openly about their different opinions			1
in december , @entity2 's new president , @entity171 , was sworn in			1
the veteran human rights activist , who had been imprisoned during @entity18 's regime , was elected by an @entity175 - dominated parliament , the @entity174			2
" for people in the @entity178 , they may not understand what a big deal that is , " @entity1 says			0
" tunisians understand it and that 's what really matters			2
it will take time to live in freedom and to have democracy			0
i ca n't wait for my son to understand that one day			0

on december 17 , 2010 , a street vendor set himself on fire to protest government
@entity34 's act *sparked* a revolution in @entity2
those demonstrations toppled @entity2 's *leader* , and prompted @entity31
