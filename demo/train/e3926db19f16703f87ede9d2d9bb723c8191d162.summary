there was a time when @entity3 was , simply , " the fat one			1
" when tv viewers first saw @entity3 -- whether it was on " @entity7 , " his and @entity9 's national @entity8 movie review show , or " @entity17 , " the widely syndicated version -- they latched on to the look : a slightly rumpled , sweater - vested guy with glasses , paired off with the much taller , balding @entity9 ( who , of course , was " the bald one " )			1
never mind the @entity18 for criticism , which @entity3 was the first film critic to win			1
never mind the probing interviews with figures such as @entity22 and @entity23			2
never mind the expertise he brought to his job or the no - nonsense attitude he had in offering his critiques			1
most people did n't see that -- until they settled in and watched the two @entity32 critics go after each other , debating the finer points of " @entity35 " or " @entity36			2
" it was only then that , perhaps , viewers realized this was n't just a show about movies			2
movie quiz : how ' @entity3 ' are you ? it was also a show about movie reviewing , movie embracing , @entity47			1
a shared awe and love of pictures projected in the dark			0
and that was @entity3 's genius			1
( @entity9 , who died in 1999 , should get some credit , too			0
the pair 's chemistry was integral to the show 's spirit			1
) they reveled in film in ways that appealed to the aficionados -- folks who knew who @entity64 and @entity65 were -- and to the masses , popcorn - loving audiences who did n't care so much about art as wanting to be entertained for two hours			1
but well before " @entity7 " and well after @entity9 's death , @entity3 reveled in film and shared his enthusiasm with others			1
in 1967 , when he was hired as the @entity75 ' movie critic , he had n't yet turned 25 but sounded like a film veteran			1
a generation later , when the @entity77 came calling , he was all over it , developing his own website , tweeting incessantly , sounding off in one format or another			0
he made his site a home for young movie enthusiasts and ran reviews from " far - flung correspondents			1
" he invited comments and , perhaps surprisingly , rarely had to deal with trolls			0
by loving conversation , he made sure the dialogue was always respectful			2
trolls and fanboys went elsewhere to vent			0
it 's not that he was n't opinionated			2
his arguments with @entity9 -- and later with @entity95 -- testify to that			0
one of his books was titled " i hated , hated , @entity98			0
" another was " @entity3			1
" but even the emotion was less about anger than disappointment , a sense of " how dare you			0
" he knew how hard it was to make a movie ; after all , he 'd written the script for a couple , including " @entity110 , " and went out of his way to praise small performances and little - known filmmakers			1
a film that did n't try was more than a waste of time			2
" ( @entity121 ) hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it , " he wrote about " @entity120			0
" " i 've seen bad movies before			0
but they usually made me care about how bad they were , " he wrote about a film called " @entity128			2
" not even cancer , which forced the removal of his lower jaw and eventually took his life , could tamp down his energy			0
as he watches a movie , " @entity3 scribbles constantly , his pen digging into page after page , and then he tears the pages out of his notebook and drops them to the floor around him			1
maybe 20 or 30 times , the sound of paper being torn from a spiral rises from the aisle seat in the last row , " @entity146 wrote in a 2010 @entity148 profile			0
" the lights come back on			0
@entity3 stays in his chair , savoring , surrounded by his notes			1
it looks as though he 's sitting on top of a cloud of paper			2
" watching movies has been compared to waking dreams : the darkness , the colors , the sense of being immersed in another world			0
more than once , @entity3 wrote about the experience of seeing films as a reverie and escape			1
few were better at conveying that sense to those outside the theater			0
and that cloud ? one can see him there , a man among the mist , lost in the light .			0

movie critic @entity3 appealed to film aficionados and the popcorn - loving masses
in 1975 , @entity3 was the first film critic to win a @entity18
@entity3 's *legacy* is *explored* in @entity189 ' " @entity188 "
