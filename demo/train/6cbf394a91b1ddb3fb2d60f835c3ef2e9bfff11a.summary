-- @entity2 citizens who support peaceful change that will allow them to enjoy their human rights expect the international community , and in particular the @entity6 , to hold the @entity7 to account			1
the new session of the @entity9 began on march 1			2
a failure of the world 's most influential human rights body to deal with the abuse of human rights in @entity2 will be interpreted by @entity15 as a green light for the government 's brutal policies that could result in more executions of political prisoners			1
scores of peaceful demonstrators have been killed on the streets or in prison since the disputed june 2009 presidential elections			0
four political prisoners have been executed and others , including 20 - year - old @entity28 , who has been convicted of " enmity against @entity30 " for throwing rocks at a demonstration , face death penalties			0
more than 1,000 @entity2 are behind bars for expressing their political views			2
leading politicians and clerics are calling for the harshest sentences for more of these prisoners			0
in february , @entity2 's human rights record was examined under the @entity42 procedure			1
a number of @entity6 members expressed deep concern about post-election abuses and chronic problems such as torture , the execution of juvenile offenders and discrimination against women			0
other countries praised @entity2 's progress in improving social welfare			1
at the end of the exercise , @entity2 rejected outright recommendations to end juvenile executions , end torture , release illegally detained persons , and prosecute officials guilty of rape , torture and murder in prisons			2
they rejected recommendations to end legal discrimination against women			0
they rejected the idea of inviting @entity6 special rapporteurs -- none of whom as has been allowed to visit @entity2 since 2005 -- to examine the allegations			2
while atrocities since june have horrified people around the world , leading to demonstrations by more than 50,000 people in 110 cities last summer , @entity2 seems , astonishingly , to be strengthening its standing in the @entity9			1
the 47 member states have shown no willingness to hold a special session , as many international human rights experts have recommended , nor have they supported the idea of a special @entity6 envoy to look into the situation , and to press @entity2 to abide by its commitments			1
one reason seems to be that the international community is preoccupied with persuading @entity2 to keep its nuclear development program from creating an atomic weapon			2
even without a bomb , @entity2 already seems to have achieved a form of nuclear deterrence : the nuclear issue creates conflict that justifies police state methods to keep the population under control , while reducing international pressure to end such abuses , which other states fear will spoil delicate negotiations			1
the strategy is working for the @entity2 government			2
now they have their sights set on gaining a place on the @entity9 itself in elections by the @entity112 that will take place in may			0
the failure of the @entity9 to take serious action to condemn @entity2 's human rights abuses , and the election of @entity2 to the @entity9 itself , will be deeply disillusioning for the reform and human rights movement in @entity2			1
it could destroy their faith in the international human rights system , for which many have sacrificed their freedom and security , and for which many have died			0
it will give legitimacy to hanging political prisoners , and more will be hanged			0
but this issue is not just about @entity2			0
it is about the capacity of the @entity6 system to protect human rights			0
if @entity2 's grave abuses are ignored and if @entity2 assumes a place on the council , the council will be further weakened			1
other dictatorial regimes will be emboldened to repress their citizens			0
that is why it is crucial that members of the @entity9 make it clear to @entity2 , in a resolution that can not be brushed off , that torturing and executing political prisoners is not acceptable			1
and that is why the @entity112 must reject @entity2 's candidacy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 and @entity153 .			0

**co-authors** say @entity9 has yet to take serious action against abuses in @entity2
they say many protesters against conduct of election have been killed or *jailed*
@entity2 is *seeking* to gain a seat on the @entity9
**co-authors** says seating @entity2 would be a *betrayal* of that nation 's civil rights movement
