-- thank @entity1 for , shall we say , introducing interesting concepts to the bedroom			1
at least , that 's what one female fan said during the band 's recent panel promoting its13th album " @entity12 " at @entity13			1
the fan noted that the group 's music has helped , umm , set the romantic mood for some			1
reminded of this , songwriter ( and sometimes singer ) @entity19 chuckled			1
" yeah , that was funny , " he told @entity0			1
" someone once said to us , ' do you realize how many babies were conceived listening to ' somebody ' ? ' " could the band 's repertoire -- which includes songs such as " @entity32 " ( with its pre- " @entity35 " references to @entity34 ) , " @entity36 , " " stripped , " and " @entity37 , " -- have worked as an instructional manual for fans ? @entity19 's songwriting at its " @entity41 " provided a sexual initiation of sorts into a world that blurred the lines between pain , pleasure , love , guilt , and sin			1
sex " is one of the themes i 've tackled over the years , because it 's something important , and it 's something i feel passionate about , " @entity19 said			1
" but we were n't analyzing it			1
" front man @entity59 's vocals push the carnal implications , but when @entity19 added his own voice , it gave a layer of pensive , tortured tenderness			1
and though @entity19 might have pushed the sexual concepts visually -- appearing on stage in women 's lingerie , skirts , and bondage gear -- the message was a plea to " understand me			1
" a deeper dig into the band 's lyrics over a 30 years also yields themes about world politics , socialism , racism and religion			1
but it was a pre-emo appeal to the alienated and introverted that made @entity1 a bridge between the industrial / electronic / goth and pop worlds , making them one of the largest arena acts still considered a cult band			1
" i do n't know how we managed it , " @entity19 said , " but we 're just outside the mainstream			2
we do n't sound like the mainstream			2
so even in areas where we 're extremely popular , we 're seen as more of an underground band			2
even in @entity95 , where we 're one single away from having more top 10 singles than the @entity97 , we 're still seen as a cult band , and we have that mystique about us			2
" bands such as @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , the @entity104 , and @entity105 all cite @entity1 as an influence			1
" it 's incredible , " @entity19 said , citing his surprise at @entity110 's cover of " @entity111			2
" his favorites of the covers of the band 's songs include the @entity117 ' version of " @entity118 , " and the @entity120 version of " @entity121			1
" " that was very special and unbelievable , " he said			2
" i really did n't think that it was reality when that happened			2
someone told me they heard it on the radio , and i said , ' no , you must be mistaken			2
' " when @entity131 recently introduced himself as a super fan , @entity19 was happy to make his acquaintance			1
" we happened to be in the same studio complex , and he was working downstairs with @entity136 , " @entity19 recalled			0
" and toward the end of our session , he asked our engineer if he could come in and have a listen , so when we finished the song , he walked over and said hello			0
and then he said , ' i 've got a track , i 'd love to play it for you , i 've love for you to do something on it			0
' and it was really good			0
" @entity19 stayed an extra day at the studio to add some material to the then - untitled track , which might find its way on @entity154 's next album			0
" i have no idea whether he 'll actually use the pieces we did on there , but hopefully it will surface one day ! it sounded really good , " he said			0
not a @entity161 , however ? @entity162			0
the reality show judge recently became a target when @entity19 criticized him , joking that @entity162 should be shot for his crimes against pop music			1
@entity162 , naturally , shot back with his own vitriol			0
in response to the fracas , a gun range in @entity169 added a target of @entity162 for anyone wishing to take up @entity19 's suggestion			0
" that 's funny , " @entity19 laughed			0
" it was pleasantly reassuring to see how many people seemed to side with me ! " @entity19 's songs usually start out in a simple style -- " @entity111 , " for instance , originally was a stripped - down affair with @entity19 singing over an organ sound			0
" it was meant to be pastoral , and @entity184 ( @entity185 ) at the time had the idea to put a beat to it , " @entity19 recalled , laughing			0
" i was like , ' what ? ! that 's going against everything it 's saying ! ' but we tried it , and then i put the guitar riff on it , and then something magical happened , and it became the first or second most popular track we ever recorded			0
i guarantee you it would n't have been , if we had kept the harmonium version			0
" for the songs that @entity59 wrote this time around , such as " @entity204 , " the band altered them " a bit more to fit the whole sonic picture of the album , " he said			0
and some songs , whether consciously or unconsciously , allude to the band 's entire sonic history -- a little bit of " @entity121 " pokes through " @entity214			0
" " i keep going back to that @entity215 beat ! " @entity19 said			0
@entity1 is currently rehearsing in @entity216 for its upcoming world tour			1
the @entity220 stadium leg kicks off may 7 through july 29 , with @entity221 starting august 22 in @entity222 and ending october 8 in @entity223 .			0
