-- the " heady fwendship " between @entity3 and @entity4 , formed on the grounds of her guest feature on " @entity7 and @entity8 " @entity9 , has hit a rough patch			1
@entity3 posted a lengthy tweet chastising the @entity7 frontman for the nsfw video released for their collaboration , " @entity15 , " which went viral on june 1			1
in the video , @entity3 soaks naked in a bathtub singing the airy lyrics , interrupted by shots of her little sister @entity21 getting deluged by liquid corn starch , gold glitter and a milky substance			1
( @entity3 is no stranger to taking her clothes off for cameras			2
her video for " @entity29 " shows the @entity3 stripping to her knickers while strolling through her native @entity31			1
) while @entity3 first called " @entity15 " video " cosmic " in a tweet , she criticizes @entity4 for releasing an unapproved version of the visuals , and she went as far as calling him " self serving " in the @entity36 message			1
" i never would have approved that tasteless , meaningless , shock motivated video , " @entity3 wrote			2
in the message , she claimed @entity4 misled her in their collaborative process			2
" @entity43 did everything wrong from the on set , " she wrote			0
" first : you showed me a concept of beautiful tasteful imagery ( by way of vid text messages )			0
then u release an unedited , unapproved version within the next few days			0
that all spells 1 thing , @entity56			0
when asked what the concept meant after u explained it , u replied , " it does n't mean anything , i just want to make a great video that everyone is going to watch			0
" i understood , because as an artist we all desire that			0
but we do n't all do it at another artist 's expense			0
i attempted to resolve this respectfully by having conversations with u after the release but that too proved to be a poor excuse for art. " back in march , @entity3 talked to @entity0 about the collaboration , saying @entity4 interrupted her 29 times during the recording process until she was forced to say , " c'mon man , just let me sing it ! " @entity3 bought this up again in her retort , posting , " i should have followed my first mind back in studio when recording the vocals ' your way			1
' " @entity91 fans were outraged by the @entity93 video , forcing @entity4 to take full responsibility for the footage on @entity96			1
the @entity7 camp has since also released the following statement : " the video link that was erroneously posted on @entity100 by the @entity7 of the @entity101 ' , which features @entity3 , is unedited and unapproved			1
sorry ! ! we , the @entity7 , accept full responsibility for prematurely having @entity100 post it			0
it has outraged and upset a segment of fans and we apologize if we offended any viewers ! ! ! this is a @entity7 video which features @entity3 and her sister @entity21 and is not meant to be considered an @entity3 or @entity21 statement , creation , or approved version			1
" despite the lips trying to make amends , @entity3 still had these last words : " you can @entity117 * *			2
