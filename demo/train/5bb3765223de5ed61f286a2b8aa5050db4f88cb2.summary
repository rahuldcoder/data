-- @entity2 will not dismantle any of its nuclear facilities as part of an effort to reach a long - term agreement to limit its nuclear development , @entity2 president @entity1 said in an interview published friday in @entity9			1
asked during the interview if dismantling @entity2 's nuclear facilities was a " red line , " @entity1 said : " 100 percent			1
" @entity1 's statements are unlikely to sit well with @entity14 prime minister @entity13 , who has said any long - term agreement with @entity2 over its nuclear development must lead to the dismantling of the country 's nuclear capability			1
@entity2 and the so - called @entity25 -- the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 -- agreed sunday to a six - month deal to limit @entity28 's nuclear development			1
even though it 's only a short - term agreement , world leaders hope it 'll pave the way to a long - term guarantee that @entity2 wo n't produce nuclear weapons			1
and @entity2 hopes to recoup some of the billions of dollars it 's lost as a result of international sanctions			2
world powers will suspend sanctions on various items , including gold and petrochemical exports			0
that suspension will provide @entity2 with about $ 1.5 billion in revenue , according to the @entity45			2
@entity13 has criticized the agreement , calling it a " historic mistake			0
" now that sanctions are working , @entity13 wants to see them tightened , not loosened , until @entity2 shuts down much of its nuclear capability			2
@entity14 and the @entity51 have accused @entity2 of secretly working to develop a nuclear weapons program , an allegation that @entity28 has vehemently denied			2
" the nuclear activities of the @entity55 of @entity2 as has been repeatedly said will be purely for peaceful purposes , " @entity1 said			1
but he also told the newspaper how much uranium is enriched by @entity2 will " depend on our needs for nuclear fuel			1
" @entity1 gave the interview as he marked his 100th day as @entity2 's leader			1
@entity1 , whose tone is far less fiery than that of his predecessor , @entity67 , promised during his election campaign that he would work toward positive engagement with the @entity51			0
his charm offensive , as it has been described , has raised questions among many about whether @entity1 is serious in easing tensions with the @entity51			0
@entity1 told the newspaper that the agreement hammered out in @entity76 is an important first step to see if a mutual trust can be built with the @entity19			0
" the problems created over 35 years can not be resolved over a limited time			0
the best test to see whether we are capable of building trust or not is this nuclear issue , " he said			0
" if the first steps taken in @entity76 are implemented carefully and precisely , it would mean that we have taken one step forward towards trust			0
" he also said a recent telephone call with @entity20 prime minister @entity89 left him with " a feeling that the two sides were willing to move step by step towards better relations			0

@entity2 president @entity1 said dismantling nuclear facilities is a red line
@entity1 said that the amount of uranium enriched will depend on @entity2 's needs
