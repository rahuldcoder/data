-- just two days before the tragic shooting deaths of 26 helpless people in a @entity6 elementary school , @entity2 ' governor was lamenting a major court defeat for the state 's lonely ban on concealed weapons			1
the 7th @entity11 in @entity12 had just struck down one of the most restrictive gun - control laws in the nation			1
@entity2 was the last remaining state where it was completely illegal to carry a concealed weapon in public			1
" i think it 's important that we stress that public safety comes first , " gov. @entity19 , a @entity20 and gun - control supporter , said wednesday			1
" i think that 's where the people of @entity2 are on this issue and anything having to do with guns and assault weapons like that			1
we can not have those sorts of people eligible to carry loaded weapons on their persons in public places , whether it be malls or churches or schools			1
" poll : @entity43 changing on gun control by " those , " the governor meant people with a history of domestic violence or mental illness			1
officials in @entity6 have said 20 children and six adult educators died in @entity53 in @entity53 after a 20 - year - old gunman forced his way in and began shooting			2
the killer apparently ended the spree by taking his own life			0
three weapons were found near him , including a @entity61 " assault - type rifle			2
" police later found his mother dead at their home			0
the horrific event has left many lawmakers , community leaders , families of gun violence victims , and advocates on both sides of the gun - control debate calling for some kind of action -- including a collective re-examination of the extent of rights enshrined in the @entity78 , and by centuries of tradition and practice			2
for all the political talk , however , it has usually been left to the courts -- and ultimately the @entity85 -- to sort out what is constitutionally acceptable			2
judges have taken into account legislative prerogatives , shifting public opinion , and even the headlines from tragedies like @entity53 when crafting always controversial decisions			0
the conservative majority @entity85 in recent years has been wary of some kinds of gun - control laws , but say lawmakers can still impose " reasonable " restrictions			1
that somewhat flexible standard will guide any fresh legislative attempts on the state and federal level to impose tighter ownership controls			2
in the @entity2 ruling , the 2 - 1 majority led by federal judge @entity105 gave state lawmakers 180 days to draft a new law " that will impose reasonable limitations " on publicly carrying a gun without violating the guidelines they articulated			1
opinion : why @entity114 should n't lead fight against gun violence " there is no suggestion that some unique characteristic of criminal activity in @entity2 justifies the state 's taking a different approach from the other 49 states , " said @entity105 , who was appointed to the bench by president @entity118			1
" if the @entity2 approach were demonstrably superior , one would expect at least one or two other states to have emulated it			1
" the judge said the law came close to total prohibition on carrying a gun in public , which would prevent " a person from defending himself anywhere except inside his home " and would be " so substantial a curtailment of the right of armed self - defense " that it " requires greater showing of justification " for enacting it			1
@entity2 lawmakers passed the law in response to growing street violence in urban areas like @entity12 , which has seen a spike in gang - related shootings , especially involving young people			1
the appeals judges cited as a precedent a recent @entity43 @entity85 ruling in a separate case , also from @entity12			1
the justices in 2010 tossed out the city 's three - decade ban on handgun ownership			0
the 5 - 4 conservative majority of justices reiterated its earlier conclusion the @entity78 gives individuals equal or greater power than states on the issue of possession of certain firearms for self - protection in the home			2
" it can not be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a substantive guarantee , not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as states legislated in an evenhanded manner , " wrote justice @entity169			0
the justices , however , said local jurisdictions still retained the flexibility to preserve some " reasonable " gun - control measures already in place			0
the debate then and now for judges is how far they can apply competing parts of the 14th amendment to preserve -- and define -- those " reasonable " legislative efforts			0
opinion : gun control : change is possible -- and fast also vexing the judicial debate is whether the constitutional " right of the people to keep and bear arms " applies to local gun control ordinances or only to federal restrictions			2
that basic question had remained unanswered for decades , but the current high court now seems to allow @entity43 expanded weapon ownership rights			0
but legal observers noted last week 's ruling regarding @entity2 ' ready - to - use gun law went further than what the @entity85 has said -- over whether the right of self - defense extends beyond the home , to the street and other public places			1
the @entity207 estimates as many as 275 million guns are in the @entity43			0
in 2005 , three - quarters of the 10,100 homicides by firearms nationwide were committed with handguns			0
underpinning the legal basis for the court 's jurisdiction in these kinds of gun - control appeals is a complex reading of the 14th amendment , passed in the wake of the @entity221 to ensure all citizens -- including newly freed slaves -- were protected from state laws that might restrict their fundamental rights			1
one part ensures states can not deprive people of " life , liberty , or property , without due process of law			1
" that has been commonly applied by federal courts when it comes to disputes over basic rights , so - called " ordered liberty " cases			2
such cases include affirming the right to abortion , and to homosexual sex			0
but another rarely used provision also prevents states from depriving the " privileges or immunities " of all citizens			0
the specific question for the high court in the @entity12 case was whether the " immunities and privileges " clause should be used to overturn the handgun ban			0
an 1873 ruling limited use of that provision when considering a variety of state laws			0
analysis : why gun controls are off the agenda in @entity43 all states but @entity2 currently allow at least some limited ability to carry a concealed weapon in public , often requiring " good cause " by an individual before a permit is issued			1
four states -- @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , and @entity276 -- do not require any permit for a concealed weapon			0
after the latest mass shooting event , several congressional lawmakers have promised to introduce tougher gun - control measures in coming weeks			0
one pending bill is the @entity283 , requiring a criminal background check for all gun sales			0
such checks are already mandatory for licensed gun dealers , but not for private sellers -- who , supporters of the law say , may sell weapons at guns shows or online without such background checks			2
and there have been federal calls for extending the current ban on so - called " assault weapons " to include other types of military - style weapons and those with high - capacity magazines			2
as for the @entity2 law , its supporters appeared divided -- at least initially in the wake of the appeals court 's decision -- on whether they can or should redraft a " concealed carry " law , one that can meet the judicial mandate			1
one thing is certain : a @entity85 appeal will come in the next few months , and another potentially history - making test of individual gun rights			1
opinion : how @entity318 school massacre led to tighter gun control " today 's ruling is a major victory for law - abiding @entity322 -- and for everyone who understands that the @entity330 protects the right both to keep arms and to bear arms , " said @entity324 , executive director of @entity326 's @entity325 , just after the @entity328 decision last week			2
" this ruling makes clear that @entity2 can not deny law - abiding residents the right to carry a firearm for self - defense outside the home			1
this is a step in the right direction for all gun owners			0
we know it probably wo n't be the end of this case , and we 're ready to keep fighting until the courts fully protect the entire @entity330			0
" gun control is one of those hot - button social issues that stirs energies on competing sides			0
the rhetoric naturally becomes more heated -- and personal -- in the raw aftermath of events like the shootings in @entity53			0
the impact of rulings from the @entity360 and lower court judges acting in their mandate always come with lingering reminders of these kinds of tragedies from across the nation , as local communities wrestle with whether banning often the cheapest , most commonly available kinds of firearms will reduce violent crime or leave honest citizens vulnerable			0
the @entity2 concealed carry ruling is @entity373 ( 12 - 1269 )			1
opinion : put reason back in @entity43 's gun debate			0

a federal appeals court has struck down an @entity2 law restricting guns
gov. @entity19 said people in the state want officials to put public safety first
if the law were a superior idea , other states would have adopted it , a judge writes
another potentially history - making @entity85 appeal is certain
