@entity0 -- @entity3 co-founder @entity2 has n't seen " @entity4 , " the biopic of his founding partner that premiered friday at the @entity7			1
but in terms of how well the movie tells the story of @entity3 's heady early days , his review is already in			1
" it 's so awful and atrocious , " said @entity2 , who said he got access to a copy of the movie 's script			1
" unlike the way @entity2 and i really dealt with each other			1
" i did n't want to have much to do with that movie			2
" the film , which stars @entity22 as @entity23 , has received early mixed reviews			1
some critics said it portrayed an overly fawning image of @entity23 , while others praised @entity22 and called it an appropriate , if inaccurate , homage to @entity23 , who died in october 2011			1
speaking wednesday at @entity31 in @entity0 , @entity2 said he 's also watched a scene from the movie that was released online			1
in it , @entity2 says " nobody wants to buy a computer " as @entity23 tries to convince him of the potential			1
" never happened , " @entity2 said			1
he elaborated last week in an e-mail to @entity39 : " totally wrong			0
personalities and ... the ideas of computers affecting society did not come from @entity23 ...			2
his idea was to make a $ 20 pc board and sell it for $ 40 to help people ... build the computer i 'd given away ...			0
[ @entity50 ] e always saw a way to make a quick buck off my designs ( this was the 5th time )			0
the lofty talk came much further down the line			0
" @entity23 ' diet lands @entity22 in the hospital all that said , @entity2 thinks the movie might be fun to watch , comparing it to " @entity63 , " a 1999 made - for - tv movie that aimed to depict the early days of @entity3 and @entity65			1
" if it 's anything like ' @entity63 , ' wow -- that 's going to be so popular , " he said			2
" it 's the the fun part			2
the story 's when we were young , just like [ @entity72 biopic ] ' @entity73 , ' that type of movie			1
" perhaps predictably , @entity2 was higher on a @entity23 film being developed by writer @entity77 ( " @entity78 , " " @entity73 , " " @entity79 " )			1
@entity2 is a consultant on that movie , which will play out in three extended scenes , shot in real time , that depict @entity23 at three product rollouts : the @entity83 , @entity23 ' non-apple product @entity84 , and the @entity86			1
" it 'll have people like me backstage talking to @entity23 and him ... doing his type of thing			2
i guess that 's how it 's going to be , " he said			2
a very different kind of movie			2
" in an hourlong chat with @entity96 , president of @entity31 , @entity2 answered questions submitted by students via @entity72 and @entity99			2
some of his other points : on advice to budding entrepreneurs : " believe in yourself			0
you do n't have to win arguments			0
you do n't have to prove to someone else that you 're right			0
if you believe you 're right ... that 's what matters			2
you 've got to follow what 's in your heart			0
the second piece of advice is : how far you go in life ... it 's how well - liked you are by the people you work with			0
that will determine how far you go up organization ladders and the like			0
do n't be cutting them down			0
do n't be rude and all that stuff			0
" on whether he has " a love affair with @entity127 " : " i also have a love affair with @entity129 sometimes			0
" @entity2 , who is no longer involved in the day - to - day running of @entity3 , has long said he carries around multiple smartphones and other gadgets by various companies			1
on tech patent wars : " new innovators should not be blocked			0
there is some room for patents			0
we develop stuff and sometimes you come up with something very clever and , yeah , there is some room for that			0
" but sometimes , he said , patents are awarded for " something that really did n't take a great mind to think of -- a little 2 - year - old with a pencil would have come up with it , almost			0
that 's a great problem because sometimes patents are used to inhibit innovation			1
" @entity77 : @entity23 biopic will be told in three scenes			1

@entity2 : story in @entity23 movie looks " awful , " " atrocious "
@entity3 co-founder says " @entity4 " may be fun , but is far from accurate
he 's higher on @entity77 's rival @entity23 biopic , on which he 's consulting
@entity2 says too many tech patents are *stifling* innovation
