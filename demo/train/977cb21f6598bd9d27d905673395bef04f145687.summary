-- more than six weeks after flight 370 disappeared , @entity2 's prime minister says his government is still not prepared to declare it -- and the 239 people on board -- lost			1
" at some point in time i would be , but right now i think i need to take into account the feelings of the next of kin -- and some of them have said publicly that they are n't willing to accept it until they find hard evidence , " @entity8 told @entity0 's @entity9 in an exclusive tv interview			1
still , he said , it is " hard to imagine otherwise			0
" @entity8 also announced that his government will release a preliminary report next week on the plane 's disappearance			1
the report has already been submitted to the @entity25			0
a month ago , @entity8 announced that , based on satellite data from @entity28 , investigators had determined the plane 's " last position was in the middle of the @entity32 , west of @entity33			1
this is a remote location , far from any possible landing sites			0
it is therefore with deep sadness and regret that i must inform you that , according to this new data , flight @entity40 ended in the southern @entity32			2
" that same day , @entity43 sent a text to relatives of the passengers saying " we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that @entity40 has been lost and that none of those onboard survived			0
" in the interview thursday with @entity0 , @entity8 called it " a bizarre scenario which none of us could have contemplated			1
" how could a plane that was supposed to head toward @entity55 end up " half - way toward @entity57 ? " he said			0
@entity8 said he repeatedly asked the investigators whether they were sure , " and their answer to me was , ' we are as sure as we can possibly be			1
' " some relatives of those on board and analysts have criticized @entity2 's handling of the investigation , accusing the government of hiding or poorly communicating information			2
asked whether his country had bungled the search , @entity8 stressed that authorities had faced an " unprecedented " situation that would have been a struggle for any country to handle			1
" some of the things , we did well			2
we were very focused on searching for the plane			0
we did n't get our communications right , absolutely right , to begin with			2
but i think toward the later part , we got our act together , " @entity8 said			1
" so i 'm prepared to say that there are things we did well and things that we did n't do too well			1
" that 's one thing an investigation team will look at , he said			2
" we 're prepared to look into it , " he said , " and we 're prepared for this investigation team to do its objective assessment			0
" the night of the flight 's disappearance , a military radar picked up a plane traveling across the @entity95			1
@entity8 said he believes there was someone monitoring the radar , " but the interpretation was done after the event			1
" it was not known whether the plane was @entity40 , he said , and no planes were sent up to investigate " because it was deemed not to be hostile			0
" it " behaved like a commercial airline , following a normal flight path , " he said			0
the vanishing of flight 370 is " very , very different " from the 1997 crash of a @entity111 flight and the 2009 loss of an @entity114 flight , @entity8 added			1
" this is totally unprecedented			0
" there have been only " pings " and " handshakes " to go by , he said			0
" that we have analyzed			0
that is all we have			0
" families ' next step : demanding answers from @entity124 more than 45 days into the search , here come the lawyers flight 370 -- families turn grief into action @entity0 's @entity131 contributed to this report .			2
