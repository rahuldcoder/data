-- one of the most influential figures in @entity3 media says he is stunned by the speed and scale of the chaos unleashed by @entity9 insurgents in @entity10 , and sees no early end to it			1
" @entity3 is beyond clarity , beyond understanding , " said @entity13 , former director general of the @entity15 news network and now head of an @entity18 think tank trying to influence the future of the region			1
speaking at a journalism conference in @entity24 , @entity13 portrayed the crisis as a new and extremely dangerous phase in an ongoing breakup of historic borders and political structures , set up largely by the @entity30 and imposed on the @entity32 world since colonial times			1
the 2011 @entity34 was the hopeful ignition of popular discontent against historic leaders and norms , but its suppression in most places where it flared up had combined with the crisis in @entity41 to ignite war from protest , he said			0
" @entity48 is merging into terrorism , " said @entity13 , speaking last week at the @entity44 , which promotes innovation and debate among journalists			1
@entity13 admitted he was probably too optimistic about the long - term impact of the outpouring of popular discontent that overthrew long - established dictatorships and military regimes in @entity55 and @entity56 , and fueled the western military intervention that helped topple @entity58 in @entity59			1
he said he foresaw a future in which the ouster of the elected @entity63 government of @entity64 in @entity56 combined with a military takeover in @entity59 , the crisis in @entity10 and the three year - civil war in @entity41 , would give potential moderates little room to exert political power			0
into that vacuum comes violence and terror			0
" an arc of crisis will emerge from @entity76 up to @entity77 ... gangsters , militant groups , trafficking , everything , but not states , " he said			0
@entity13 , who created the most powerful media network in the @entity3 with the backing of the ruling family of @entity86 , is a veteran of two @entity87 and both covered and directed coverage of two decades of upheaval			1
yet even he is stunned by the scale of the crisis in @entity10 where @entity9 militants of @entity93 , emboldened by gains on the battlefield in @entity41 , have moved across the border			0
" we have seen the most amazing collapse of any army we have seen in the last decades , " @entity13 said			1
without apologizing for the brutality of those attacks or attempting to justify it , @entity13 was clear that the move of @entity93 into @entity10 to intervene against what it sees as a heretic and sectarian @entity106 government , was directly connected to the 2003 @entity109 - led invasion and decades of hypocrisy and ignorance by @entity113 powers			1
he said he believed @entity113 reluctance to intervene in @entity41 , a readiness to leave " generals " in charge in @entity56 , @entity59 and @entity117 and to hand @entity10 to a @entity106 - dominated administration in thrall to @entity120 , had combined to make the situation ripe for extremists to take charge across the region			0
ultimately that would threaten not only @entity10 and @entity41 but all existing borders in the @entity32 world and eventually @entity129 and the @entity130 he predicted			2
the @entity93 crisis and its easy move across into @entity10 from @entity41 highlighted how irrelevant the borders imposed by @entity134 and @entity135 on the @entity32 world nearly 100 years ago are , he said			2
" the state in the @entity32 world is a joke and it is something we should confront , " said @entity13 , whose new venture , the @entity137 , aims to promote dialogue and discussion about long - term change in the region			1
critics see the former journalist as too close to @entity148 , a charge which he rejects			0
he has also faced the strange situation of being attacked by @entity109 leaders while accused of being in their pay			0
the fragility of borders and of states created after @entity157 by colonial powers will put huge strain on @entity130 and region , he predicts			2
" everything is in a state of flux , " he said			0
" if this region continues to disintegrate ... i think this region will be the most dangerous against the rest of the world			0
" what can @entity113 nations , particularly the @entity109 , do to deal with the new situation ? @entity13 suggested they should stop thinking that supporting old - style military leaders in @entity56 and elsewhere would put a cap on the forces of discontent unleashed by the @entity34			2
" the current situation is actually shameful , [ with ] no morality and no ethics ... one of the worst deeds that the @entity30 is perpetrating against the @entity32 world , " he said			2
the @entity30 may also have to accept a redrawing of borders that were never truly accepted by those living within them and rethink the role of @entity120			1
" there is a major mess when it comes to the strategic thinking of our leaders			0

@entity13 is the former director general of @entity15 and now head of an @entity18 think tank

@entity13 : " we have seen the most amazing collapse of any army in the last decades "
" the @entity30 may also have to accept a redrawing of borders , " he says
