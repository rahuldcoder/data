-- @entity2 's economy has the potential to transform lives like no other force on @entity6 , but too often in recent years we have seen @entity9 act as an anchor			1
and while @entity12 and presidents may generate the business headlines , an over-involved federal government hurts employees and those looking for jobs across the entire spectrum			1
as someone who grew up in poverty , watching his single mother work 16 - hour days to provide as much as she possibly could for us , i have lived the power of the @entity24			0
with help from my mom and my mentor , i learned that i did n't have to be an entertainer or an athlete to achieve my goals ; i could think my way out of poverty			2
i realized the power of education , and the incredible opportunities provided by free markets			0
sen. @entity37 : finishing our nation 's unfinished business my fear is that too many folks these days are n't given the chance to see the greatness that resides within them			1
over the past 50 years , we 've seen the @entity47 struggle in its core mission -- to help lift folks up			1
it 's time for a change , so i have introduced my @entity52			2
a significant part of my @entity52 is focused on job - training efforts			0
there are 4 million open jobs across the country right now -- jobs that are unfilled because of a skills gap in the work force			0
this in spite of the fact there are 35 federal work - force development programs			2
my @entity64 , which the @entity65 has already passed thanks to the efforts of rep. @entity68 , @entity69 , would cut through the bureaucratic maze and mountains of red tape that hinder these programs			2
we 'll create one @entity75 , cutting waste and duplication out while ensuring more dollars are used for their actual purpose -- job training			1
president @entity81 signaled that vice president @entity82 would be looking at job - training programs this year -- i eagerly await their call to discuss my proposal			2
i am also working on a proposal to create opportunity zones across @entity2 to tie some of the tax dollars coming out of our low - income communities to the community itself in order to rebuild infrastructure and lift those areas up			1
in my time on county council in @entity99 , this concept was referred to as @entity101 ( @entity101 ) districts , and i see great potential in this concept at the federal level			0
it is not enough to simply rebuild , or as some would call it gentrify , our tougher neighborhoods -- we have to provide the opportunity to the folks living there already to take part in a brighter future			0
population shifting is n't fixing the problem , it is simply moving it somewhere else			0
so instead of overtaxing and overregulating , i see a future where the government cuts out waste and duplication , and gives all @entity2 the chance to realize their full potential			1
as i travel throughout @entity124 , be it speaking with a local chamber of commerce , or a group of pastors , or working at a burrito store for a morning ( verdict : my own skills with a broom could stand some polishing ) , my constituents are very clear : they do n't want a handout , just a hand up			1
it is n't the federal government 's responsibility to guarantee outcomes			1
it is , however , our responsibility to make sure that a better future is possible if people want it			0
opportunity knocks for all of us at some point			0
my hope is that @entity9 does n't get in the way of folks answering			0
join us on @entity152 / @entity151			0
