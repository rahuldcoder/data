turns out you can do a lot of really smart things , as long as you 're clueless			1
at @entity4 , we 've already created a device to let a paralyzed painter create his art , using just the movement of his eyes			1
we made it to the @entity11 and printed a new arm on a 3d printer for a teenaged boy whose arms were blown off in the war -- and he fed himself for the first time in two years			2
and pretty soon , we 'll have a device that will allow patients suffering from @entity21 's disease to type on a computer -- just by thinking			1
we did n't have any fancy labs for any of this , or gigantic budgets			2
we did n't go through insurance companies or medical labs			2
we made all of these devices for maybe a couple hundred bucks apiece -- some for much less			2
( the @entity32 , as we 're calling it , includes a homemade @entity34 device based on a prototype that a couple of our team members fashioned out of some electrodes , two nine - volt batteries , and an old sock , in their kitchen , at 2 in the morning			1
i was n't there , but i 'm told there was some whiskey involved as well )			2
in each case , the experts told us that what we were doing just could n't be done			2
fortunately , we did n't listen , or did n't hear them , or ignored them , or were oblivious , or all of the above			2
we went ahead and tried anyway			2
and what do you know			2
this all started when i met a graffiti artist named tempt , who was paralyzed with @entity58			1
i was a film producer , with no experience whatsoever in the field of technological medical devices			1
but when i learned how he was communicating with his family -- they 'd run their fingers over a piece of paper with the alphabet printed on it , he 'd blink when they 'd get to the letter he wanted , and , painstakingly , he 'd spell out a sentence -- i was moved , and angry , and a whole lot of other things			2
and i blurted out to his father , " we will find a way to get tempt to paint again			0
" see , i was just clueless enough not to know that that was impossible			1
so we got a bunch of crazy hackers together , and @entity83 's plight gave way to the @entity84 : a device that tracked his eye movements , translated that to a cursor , and allowed him to create drawings			1
it was a beautiful thing to see			0
at one point , a group of programmers and coders told us , " if you had any clue how hard it is to do what you did , you never would have tried it in the first place			0
" i 'm so glad we were clueless			0
what happened with @entity83 gave way to the @entity4 , a foundation and company with a simple idea			1
we 'll create these devices with whatever we can -- coat hangers , duct tape , chewing gum			0
essential to the process is what 's called " open source " -- we give everything away , for free			0
we post the design on the @entity116 and hope other people will pick it up and improve it			0
that 's just what happened with the @entity84 : a @entity123 engineering team in @entity124 saw the device and made a better one			1
now @entity123 , working with a government agency , is providing hundreds of those to @entity58 patients			0
and they 've " open - sourced " their design as well -- so now anyone can make one , for around 50 bucks			1
we starting thinking about what we were doing as the @entity132			0
anyone who has tried to get a medical device for a loved one , and had to negotiate the maze that 's created by the provider , the hospital , the lawyers , the insurance companies , knows just how absurd it can be			1
it 's absurd that in this day and age , an @entity58 patient would have to communicate with his parents by watching them run their fingers over a piece of paper			0
it 's like seeing someone rubbing two sticks together , and thinking , hey , someone should invent a match for these people			0
so that 's what we 're doing			0
we 're down in the basement , inventing matches			0
everyone told me i was crazy to go to the @entity11 -- one of the most dangerous , war - torn areas of the globe -- in search of @entity163 , a boy i 'd read about whose arms had been blown off by a bomb			1
three months later , we 'd not only tracked @entity163 down and fashioned a new hand for him , but we left the 3d printer and materials behind , and trained a group of locals to make the hands -- which they 're cranking out now , for others maimed in the war			0
not impossible just kept growing -- because of passionate , brilliant people who were always willing and able to do good , but just needed a place to point their energy			1
a guy up in @entity179 named @entity180 saw a @entity182 talk i gave about the @entity84 , decided he wanted in , and started devoting all his spare time to taking it one step further			1
the @entity84 relies on the patient 's ability to blink , as a way to " click " the cursor the way you 'd click a mouse			0
but what about patients who ca n't control their ocular muscles anymore ? he asked			0
do n't they deserve to communicate , too ? so he started devoting all his spare time to hooking our @entity84 device up to an @entity34 -- a homemade device to register brain activity as a way of clicking a mouse			1
" working in the scientific field , you kind of run into ' yes ' people and ' no ' people , " said @entity204 , another member of the @entity205 ( and the one who came up with the electrodes - and - sock model			1
) " there are the scientific people who are the skeptics , who just say there 's just no way this can be done			0
and there are people like me and @entity180 who say , ' this is totally impossible , but we 're just gon na try and do it			1
' " @entity204 possesses a quality -- as do the other members of the team , @entity227 and @entity228 -- that , i think , is essential to success			0
we call it beautiful naïvete			0
because if you 're just naïve enough to believe you can do what everybody tells you that you ca n't , amazing things can happen			0
it 's just possible , in fact , that you 'll discover what each of us has discovered : that nothing , in fact , is impossible .			1

@entity244 started not impossible because " i hate the word ' no ' . "
they look to " *crowdsource* " technological *solutions* to *problems*
@entity4 found a way to print 3 - d limbs for less than a tenth of their usual cost
they created a device that allowed a paralyzed graffitti artist to draw with his eyes
