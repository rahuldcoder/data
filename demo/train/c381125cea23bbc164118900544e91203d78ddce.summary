@entity0 , @entity1 -- it is a sight almost as surreal as it is disturbing : three boys , on the cusp of being teenagers , digging furiously with their hands and sticks			1
it is in some ways playtime , but there is little innocence left in this refugee camp sandwiched between @entity1 's north and an unwelcoming @entity17 border			1
@entity19 says their frantic excavations are in case " jets come and drop bombs , " he said			2
" we put children here to hide them , but of course we will make it much bigger for 20 to 30			2
" it is a testament to their fast and unnatural path into manhood : hours that should be spent idling or playing football are lost to digging an air raid shelter			1
@entity19 can explain the different noises made by jet missiles , rocket - propelled grenades and heavy machine guns			2
the three boys are also digging peepholes into their structure , so they could see outside during any attack			1
it 's rudimentary and made entirely of mud and finger marks , but it is all they have			0
this is life for the 8,000 @entity1 who fled everything , hoping for something but ending up with little			1
despite being some 100 yards from a @entity55 power -- the doorstep of @entity57 -- and a developed economy , they scavenge for wood and burn plastic to keep warm			1
they chop down weeds to supplement their faltering diet			2
some 22 months into the war -- and despite the world 's sympathy -- they face a winter of freezing temperatures and uncertain food			2
refugees in the @entity72 just inside @entity1 can see the @entity17 refugee camps from the roofs of their buildings , but @entity17 for now will not accept them			1
so they are caught between the war they fled and the outside world that will not embrace them			0
they number some 200 families and growing , huddled around plastic tents that work as temporary shelter during summer but will do little to protect them from the frost of winter			1
@entity86 used to work in the nearby town of @entity88 for the @entity89 and is now the closest thing this sprawling camp has to an organizer			0
he explains why so many ended up shut out by @entity17			1
" of course 80 % of those here came hoping to cross into @entity17 , " he said , " but the @entity17 government stopped hosting over six weeks ago			1
people are furious , and we ca n't provide a lot of their daily needs			0
" here , within earshot of @entity17 's highways , you can also hear the distant but occasional thud of artillery -- a reminder that the war they fled remains the worse option over the squalor they now endure			1
@entity112 , however , will be their greatest enemy in the months ahead			0
dozens of families have taken advantage of the concrete truck shelters at this border crossing , moving their tents into the hangar - like structures , hoping the roofs will provide a little more shelter			1
but for @entity125 's daughter @entity124 , the cold came too fast			0
holding his surviving daughter , the thick - set man describes how @entity124 died			0
" she was not sick			0
she did n't have any problems at all			0
we were up late that night and we were playing with her , " he said			0
" we woke up the next morning ... she was curled into a ball from the cold			0
we buried her in the village			0
her sister is afraid now of the cold			0
" had his family had a stove in their tent just a few weeks earlier , @entity124 would have lived			0
but the struggle to keep warm brings its own hazards			0
easier to find is plastic , which burns with a sickly , acrid smoke			2
children scour the fields for this " treasure " but then reap the consequences from the heat : a poisonous blanket of smoke that brings hacking coughs to each settlement			2
at the sun sets , children find a patch of herbs -- weeds almost -- growing naturally against a wall and cut them down for food			1
despite being so close to a developed economy , they are reeling with the war raging next door			0
but now it is the best the world has to offer for these 8,000 @entity1			1
