@entity0 , @entity1 -- waiting in a parked car in the @entity5 as the rain pounds down , i can not help but think about the flood in the movie , " @entity8			2
" it 's a natural , because i am only a stone 's throw from where the levee broke , and i am here to meet the star of that movie , @entity17 , as the finale to our " @entity21 " tour			1
the actor targeted this area some years ago with his @entity24 -- an ambitious plan to build up the shattered neighborhood with new , ecologically friendly , affordable houses , and then fill them with residents who had been driven out by @entity30			1
when the rain backs off a bit , i hustle into one of the raised houses , where my tv crew is busy setting up lights on a covered upper deck			2
@entity38 is also there , but in a different area			1
i spend a few minutes chatting with @entity41			2
we 've known each other for years and share a lot of friends , and it 's always nice catching up			1
after a while , he asks , " who 's going first on this ? " i respond , " you are			1
" he goes to get ready , and i look at the houses arrayed all around us			2
they are architectural marvels -- striking designs of unexpected angles , bright colors and green innovations : solar panels on the roofs , energy - saving appliances , rainwater collection systems			1
they do n't look like anything else you 'll see in the @entity5 , but when @entity17 finishes with @entity41 and comes up the stairs , no one is looking at the architecture			1
" " hi , @entity70			0
" he shakes my hand , flashes that famous smile , and his eyes twinkle ( i 'm no star chaser , but i swear , they really do )			0
he takes a quick sip from the coffee cup he 's carrying as we settle in to talk			1
" you have set for yourself a very ambitious project in taking on a very difficult problem , " i say			0
" five years in , how do you think you 're doing ? " " these houses here have exceeded my expectations , " he says , looking across the neighborhood			0
" the goal here was how do you build affordable housing that 's high - performance , and that is going to be strong enough to withstand the kind of weather that we 're seeing down here			1
things that drive the price up , we 've got to get down			0
" mindful of how such plans often go , i say , " i 'm guessing your first units here cost a lot more than your later ones			0
" " sure , but now we 're down to dollar - for - dollar what it costs to build anything else here , " @entity17 says			1
when asked how he did that , @entity17 replies , " we had to start over			1
we thought we could do it better			0
we thought we could build a house with light and high - performance technology , that we could bring bills down and give the families who live here a better life , and we wanted to prove it at the low income level			1
" and now every house you see here , last month , every one but one was producing more energy than it was consuming			2
that 's a game - changer			1
and there is no reason to build any other way now , " @entity17 says			1
@entity17 says he also wants to spread this idea beyond this neighborhood , looking into other areas in the @entity129 and even abroad			1
donations from all over the country have fueled the first part of the project			2
@entity17 acknowledges he has n't made it very far on that next step			1
" you know this neighborhood was built on the kindness of strangers , " he says , quoting " @entity136			0
" " the old @entity136 public housing project stood not far from where we are			0
for this to go on , it has to be on the governmental level			0
" they have to look at this and set new practices , and new [ building ] codes			0
but in the meantime , with more donations now , we could get into other parts of the city , " he says			0
" these people are pioneers here , and they have built the greenest neighborhood in the world			2
and i see this as a template that will work in any climate , any condition			0
" @entity17 's love for @entity0 dates back to when he shot " @entity166 , " in the mid- 1990s			1
but his excitement for this project is obvious -- enough so that i wonder if it is taking over as the central interest in his life			0
we were told repeatedly by @entity17 's handlers that he really does n't like talking about his famous partner , @entity175 , and their children			1
i was n't here to ask about his movie career , but oddly enough , as we end our chat , both subjects come up			0
i look out over the houses he 's brought to this troubled part of town and ask , " could you see yourself at any point giving up acting to do this ? " he pauses a moment , the way celebrities do when they encounter a question they have not been asked before			2
" @entity192 , sure , " he says hesitantly ; then , warming to the idea of giving up the grind of being a movie superstar , " i 'm quite excited by this idea of building a future and the direction that we 're going			2
i 'm getting older anyway			0
i see doing that less and less			0
" you 'll have to have something to pass your time			0
" " oh , i 've got plenty of things to pass my time , " he says , and in a reference to the famous family brood , adds , " six of them			0

@entity17 's @entity24 builds *eco-friendly* homes in area hit by @entity30
solar panels , energy - saving appliances among features designed for homes
@entity17 hopes idea will spread across country , around the world
