" so tell me , " an old school friend asked , " if the demand for chocolate is so high , why are cocoa farmers so poor ? " we were sitting in the local pub , just days after i returned from a trip to the @entity9 , filming a @entity1 documentary about child labor and poverty in the chocolate industry			1
two years after @entity1 's @entity15 exposed @entity16 , it was time to return to the cocoa plantations to unwrap the chocolate supply chain , to investigate what progress has been made to stop child labor and to explore how farmers can get more money for their beans			1
my friend did n't know what he was letting himself in for			0
the answer to his question is neither simple nor short -- and " cocoa - nomics " has become something of an obsession of mine			2
the chocolate industry is worth an estimated $ 110 billion a year , and yet its key commodity is grown by some of the poorest people on the planet , in plantations that can hide the worst forms of child labour			1
accurate figures are impossible to come by , but up to 800,000 children are thought to work in the cocoa sector across the @entity9 ; children who are both a symptom of and a self - perpetuating factor in a much wider problem -- poverty			2
in 1980 the international cocoa price was $ 3,750 a tonne -- equivalent to $ 10,000 a tonne in 2013			2
nowadays it is considered high at roughly $ 2,800 a tonne			2
over the same period , the value of cocoa within a chocolate bar has halved from 12 % to just 6 % , so although a farmer 's cocoa is essential to a chocolate bar , its value is a small part of the ultimate cost of production			1
most ( 70 % ) of a modern day chocolate bar 's value goes to the manufacturer because the majority of the costs are in marketing , research and development			1
in 2012 , as part of sweeping reforms to the cocoa sector the @entity9 government enforced a minimum price for cocoa at the farm gate ; at 60 % of the international market price , it 's about $ 1.5/kg			1
no farmer will tell you it is enough , but it does mean they can budget ahead , and are less at the mercy of passing middlemen or traders			0
@entity86 , director of the @entity87 , says the @entity9 's reform of the cocoa sector was guaranteeing a steadier price , " at least in its first steps			2
" " it may not be as high as the farmers would like , to jump out of poverty , " he says			0
" but at least it 's steady and they know what 's coming "			0
a guaranteed minimum price was the first gust of a prevailing wind which is now sweeping over the cocoa plantations : for more than a decade the " big chocolate , " companies like @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 have suffered from a barrage of bad publicity -- seemingly unwilling or unable to flex their corporate muscle to stop child labor			1
across the industry it was seen as everybody 's problem but nobody 's responsibility			2
" so what has changed ? " asked my friend , who by now was tucking into a hearty pub lunch			0
infographic : @entity124 explained i 'm afraid the answer lies in self - interest as much as corporate responsibility : growing cocoa is becoming unsustainable			0
there 's a crisis brewing			0
the average age of a cocoa farmer is about 51 ( not much lower than the average life expectancy ) ; and across the @entity9 plantations are old , diseased and in need of regeneration			1
but regeneration requires investment , and the younger generation would rather migrate to the capital city , @entity141 , or switch to more lucrative crops like rubber or palm oil			0
in @entity146 , the cocoa supply is failing to meet increasing demand			1
and with 1.3 billion @entity149 starting to acquire a taste for chocolate , demand looks set to rise exponentially -- particularly in emerging markets -- in the coming years			1
so in the @entity9 , which produces more than a third of the world 's cocoa , there is now an urgent business case for doing the right thing , and helping to improve the lives of cocoa - growers			1
that means investing in those at the bottom of the value chain : educated , business - minded farmers are the only way to secure a sustainable cocoa supply in the future			1
my trip to the @entity9 coincided with a visit from @entity172 , @entity102 's top cocoa executive -- a real - life @entity174 who oversees 468 chocolate factories in 86 countries			1
@entity102 's " @entity184 " has pledged $ 120 million worldwide over ten years ; at a new research and development centre in the capital @entity141 , they are the breeding the next generation of super saplings -- disease resistant , high - yield cocoa trees			1
they plan to give away 12 million new plants to @entity9 farmers by 2016			0
in rural communities they are working to promote awareness of child labour and building schools			0
is it enough ? it 's easy to criticise : their sustainable cocoa plan covers just 15 % of their global supply chain and yet they made a profit of $ 11.55 billion in 2012			1
fortunately they are not acting alone			0
where @entity102 has its " @entity184 , " @entity204 food giant @entity203 has its " @entity205			0
" we visited one of 1,200 field schools set up by the company to teach 60,000 farmers good agricultural practice -- and that means no child labor			1
there is a growing perception that the @entity9 government , ngos and chocolate corporations , are starting to work together -- all in the name of sustainability			0
@entity222 farming cooperatives are gaining momentum , empowering farmers at a village level			0
if their farmers ' beans are grown sustainably , a cooperative can be certified by organisations like the @entity230 , the @entity231 and @entity232			2
certified beans command a higher market price and a premium on top that feeds directly back into the community			0
and this is where " cocoa - nomics " meets the consumer -- where we can make the choice to buy chocolate bars made from sustainably and ethically - sourced cocoa			2
the international market price of cocoa is set by a multitude of market forces , and the truth is cocoa farmers are at the wrong end of the supply chain , limited by the value they can extract from raw beans			1
a total recalibration of the industry is not going to happen and powerful chocolate companies like @entity102 are businesses , with shareholders to please , not charities			2
the sceptics would argue that it pays to keep the poor poor			0
except we love chocolate -- and so its makers need more quality cocoa beans : where there is an insatiable demand , there is surely hope for cocoa farmers			1
and so among the grinding poverty , signs of positive change -- albeit on a small scale -- are clearly visible : school children in khaki uniforms , the next generation of farmers who , in turn , will insist their children are educated			0
to lift a whole society out of poverty and eradicate child labour will take time			0
it 's the sort of holistic community approach that money alone ca n't buy			0
but that 's not to say more money from the likes of @entity102 and other " big cocoa " manufacturers is not badly needed			2
back at the pub , my friend has dutifully maintained his listening face ; he ponders the chocolate pudding on the menu but decides that apple crumble is probably a better option , today at least			0

@entity1 's @entity15 returned to @entity146 's cocoa plantations to look for progress in fight against child labor
chocolate industry worth an estimated $ 110 billion a year , but cocoa grown by some of world 's poorest people
cocoa farmers earn just a tiny *fraction* of the cost of the average chocolate bar
global demand for cocoa *outstrips* supply , *offering* hope that the industry may do more to help growers
