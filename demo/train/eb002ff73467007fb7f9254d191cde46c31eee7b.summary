-- in the weeks since an oil rig exploded and later sank into the @entity3 , president @entity1 has dealt with the tragedy with his signature cool , calm and collected approach			1
but with the oil still gushing in what is now the worst spill in @entity12 history and the environmental devastation coming ashore , the president is becoming a target of the anger that was originally directed only at @entity16			0
" one time , go off ! " director @entity17 urged on @entity0 's " @entity18 360 Â°			2
" " if there 's any one time to go off , this is it , because this is a disaster			2
" @entity17 's sentiment echoes the frustration of people who want to see @entity1 get loud , take charge and inspire them like he did during his presidential run			1
recalling then - candidate @entity1 's ability to rouse crowds into chants of " yes , we can , " presidential historian @entity27 said , " there was a feeling he was going to be one of these presidents that moved us with words the way @entity39 and @entity40 did in recent decades			1
" instead , @entity1 has presented himself as the unflappable president , with the engineer - like approach of @entity44 and the legislative astuteness of @entity46 , @entity27 said			1
" but in a time of great crisis , people are n't looking for @entity46 or @entity44			1
they are looking for powerful rhetorical leadership -- words that move the country in a positive direction , " he said			1
@entity54 : we got the president we elected the president has visited the region twice since the oil spill , most recently the friday before @entity60 weekend			0
@entity1 brought the tragedy to a more personal level , telling the public that he grew up in a place where the ocean is sacred , so he understands the emotional connection -- but it was only a brief aside in an otherwise straightforward address			1
it was hardly the outpouring that came from @entity73 democrat @entity72 , who broke into tears last week at a @entity75 hearing about the oil spill			0
" our culture is threatened			0
our coastal economy is threatened			0
and everything that i know and love is at risk , " @entity72 , who represents many of the affected @entity73 shoreline areas , told his @entity75 colleagues			0
unable to finish reading his prepared statement , @entity72 submitted it for the congressional record and then walked out of the hearing room as other lawmakers sought to comfort him			0
and it was hardly the advocacy that 's come from @entity91 gov. @entity91 , also of @entity73			0
in a column on @entity0 , @entity92 wrote that due to @entity1 's lackluster response , " @entity91 has @entity95 on the ropes and he is coming across as more passionate and more presidential			1
" @entity99 press secretary @entity98 was pushed tuesday to back up his claim that @entity1 is enraged by the situation			1
" i 've seen rage from him			2
i have , " @entity98 said at the daily briefing			2
asked to describe it , @entity98 pointed to the president 's " clenched jaw " and his call to " plug the damn hole			2
" the president has been actively engaged in the crisis -- firing the head of the @entity112 , extending the moratorium on further offshore drilling and increasing the federal presence in the region			0
but instead of a galvanizing cry of outrage at the failed efforts to cap the undersea gusher , @entity1 's made the " let 's not panic " appeal , @entity27 said			1
" with each @entity16 failure , i think the @entity12 people have wanted to feel that the president is not just in the saddle but is leading the charge , and he 's fallen short in this regard , " he said			0
despite the pummeling he 's received from pundits , it 's not too late for @entity1 to take charge of the narrative , @entity27 said , suggesting that the @entity99 set up a command center in the @entity3 to provide a clearinghouse for ideas and that @entity1 take on a more integral part of the catastrophe by spending more time in the area , meeting with fishermen and locals instead of just dropping by			1
the @entity99 has started to take a more aggressive approach , with attorney general @entity144 's announcement tuesday that the @entity145 has launched a criminal investigation into the oil spill			2
the @entity1 administration also will no longer do joint briefings with @entity16 on the spill , and instead will have former coast guard commandant adm. @entity152 handle the daily briefings on his own , senior administration officials told @entity0 on tuesday			0
the change is an effort to control the message , release accurate information about the oil spill and speak in one voice to deliver the daily message on latest developments , officials said			0
@entity1 needs to build on the momentum with a primetime address and a heartfelt message to the @entity12 people , @entity27 said			1
" there is a craving for a different kind of crisis leadership from president @entity1 largely because he 's so capable of it as we saw on the campaign trail in 2008 , " he said			1
" when he lets go and talks from the heart , he 's one of the most effective political figures in modern times			0
" @entity0 's @entity176 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 has been *criticized* for seeming *disconnected* from the tragedy in the @entity3
in a time of crisis , people want " powerful rhetorical leadership , " presidential historian says
" i 've seen rage from him . i have , " @entity99 press secretary @entity98 says
@entity27 : the craving for such crisis leadership from @entity1 is " because he 's so capable of it "
