-- the presidents of @entity2 and @entity3 universities have expressed interest in rotc programs after @entity7 voted to repeal the military 's controversial " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy that has banned openly gay and lesbian service members			1
the universities ' statements come five months after @entity14 @entity13 , then a @entity14 nominee , came under criticism by @entity18 senators who complained that she actively tried to block military recruiters from @entity20 when she was dean because of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			2
@entity13 and the @entity21 have strongly defended her actions , saying that while she opposed the military 's policy , @entity13 never kept recruiters off the university			1
four months after taking the job as @entity2 's dean , in october 2003 , @entity13 offered students her thoughts in a campus - wide e-mail , saying that to give recruiters equal access to the campus " causes me deep distress			1
i abhor the military 's discriminatory recruitment policy			1
" she called it " a profound wrong - a moral injustice of the first order			0
" in a written statement , @entity2 president @entity41 called the act to repeal " do n't ask , do n't tell " a " historic step			1
" " it affirms @entity47 ideals of equal opportunity and underscores the importance of the right to military service as a fundamental dimension of citizenship , " @entity41 said			1
" i look forward to pursuing discussions with military officials and others to achieve @entity2 's full and formal recognition of @entity58			2
i am very pleased that more students will now have the opportunity to serve their country			0
" @entity3 president @entity61 said in a written statement that @entity3 is " eager to open discussions about expanding opportunities for students interested in military service " and will discuss the matter with the faculty of the college in the spring semester			1
" meanwhile , i have asked general counsel @entity71 , secretary @entity72 and @entity74 dean @entity73 to consult with officials in @entity76 early in the new year to determine the militaryÂ¹s interest in establishing an rotc unit at @entity3 , " @entity61 said			0
" we are very hopeful that these discussions will enable us to begin a new chapter in the long history of @entity3 's support of the @entity84			2
" president @entity85 will sign the repeal on wednesday morning , the @entity21 has said , setting the stage to allow gay people to serve openly in the military			2
but the changes are n't expected to take effect for at least a few months			0
the @entity92 has an 87 - page implementation plan for the repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell			0
" over the next several weeks , military officials need to examine and rewrite a series of policies , regulations and directives related to the current law			0
once that potentially lengthy process is complete , @entity85 , defense secretary @entity101 and @entity103 chairman adm. @entity102 will each have to certify that the repeal can move ahead without negatively affecting unit cohesion and military readiness			0
after the certification , another 60 days will need to pass before the repeal is officially enacted			0
even after the repeal , gay and lesbian service members will not have every right and privilege accorded to heterosexual members of the military , largely because of the federal @entity118			1
a @entity92 study released this month concluded that allowing openly gay or lesbian troops to serve in the military would have little lasting impact on the @entity47 armed forces			1
opposition to the change was much higher in @entity125 and @entity127 combat units than in the military as a whole			0
@entity0 's @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			0
