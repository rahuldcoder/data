@entity0 -- for the past year the @entity2 has been actively working a new lead in the unsolved case involving skyjacker @entity5			1
but the information concerns a new suspect who has been dead for more than a decade , an @entity2 spokesman told @entity1 on monday			1
in november 1971 , a man calling himself @entity5 hijacked a plane and succeeded in getting authorities to give him $ 200,000 and parachutes in return for letting passengers off the plane			1
the man then asked to be flown to @entity17 but jumped out of the back of @entity19 somewhere between @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity22			1
authorities have never been able to prove whether the man survived or what his actual identity was			2
a retired law enforcement officer brought a tip to the @entity2 about a year ago , said @entity29 , a spokesman for the @entity2 's @entity30			2
the retired officer had a contact who thought he or she knew the skyjacker 's identity but added the suspect was dead			1
but that did n't mark the end of the trail			0
" family members of the deceased have cooperated with us and given us access to items which belonged to the deceased , " @entity29 said			1
the @entity2 's lab started looking for evidence that might prove the dead person was the man who skyjacked @entity5			1
the @entity2 wanted to retrieve items with fingerprints belonging to the new suspect			2
@entity29 said the @entity2 knows @entity5 had handled certain papers , including his plane ticket , and touched plane seats , but many fingerprints were found on those items			1
through the years the @entity2 managed to identify some fingerprints but not all of them			0
@entity29 would not discuss the suspect 's identity , the evidence retrieved or what the lab results were			1
but , @entity29 said , " so far there 's not a lot that 's inconsistent " with the suspect matching @entity5			1
@entity29 added the @entity2 has not been able to prove the person is the mysterious skyjacker and the law enforcement agency still does not know for certain whether @entity5 survived his leap out of the plane almost four decades ago during bad weather			1
although the @entity2 has been looking into the new lead for a year , it was first revealed during an interview with @entity74 of @entity75 in advance of the 40th anniversary of the unsolved case this coming november			0
on the afternoon of november 24 , 1971 , @entity5 -- the " @entity79 " apparently was a myth created by the press , according to the @entity2 -- approached the ticket counter of @entity19 airlines in @entity84 , @entity85 , and used cash to buy a one - way ticket to @entity20			1
" @entity5 was a quiet man who appeared to be in his mid-forties , wearing a business suit with a black tie and white shirt , " the @entity2 said in a summary of the case on its website			1
" he ordered a drink -- bourbon and soda -- while the flight was waiting to take off			0
" but later , he handed a flight attendant a note saying he had a bomb in his briefcase and asking her to sit beside him			0
she did as she was told , and the man opened a " cheap attache case " and showed her a mass of wires and red - colored sticks and demanded that she write down what he told her			2
she wrote a note demanding four parachutes and $ 200,000 in $ 20 bills and walked it up to the captain , the @entity2 said			0
when the flight landed in @entity20 , the hijacker exchanged the flight 's 36 passengers for the money and parachutes , the @entity2 said , keeping several crew members on board			1
the flight took off again after he ordered it to fly to @entity123			0
but @entity5 jumped out of the plane			1
" the pilots landed safely , but @entity5 had disappeared into the night and his ultimate fate remains a mystery to this day , " the @entity2 said			1
one clue came in 1980 , when a young boy found a rotting package full of $ 20 bills -- $ 5,800 in all -- that matched the serial numbers of the ransom money			1
the @entity2 returned most of the bills to the boy , named @entity136 , and @entity136 has since auctioned some of them , the @entity134 reported			0
the " @entity79 " stemmed from confusion in a @entity141 newsroom , the @entity134 said			0
" we 've run down thousands of leads and considered all sorts of scenarios , " the @entity2 said in 2007			0
" and amateur sleuths have put forward plenty of their own theories			0
yet the case remains unsolved			0
would we still like to get our man ? absolutely			2
" the @entity2 appealed for help from the public , releasing pictures of @entity5 's black @entity155 tie -- which he removed before jumping and which later provided authorities with a dna sample -- along with some of the found money			1
the agency reminded the public that @entity5 was no expert skydiver			1
" we originally thought @entity5 was an experienced jumper , perhaps even a paratrooper , " said special agent @entity161 in 2007			1
" we concluded after a few years this was simply not true			0
no experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch - black night , in the rain , with a 200 - mile - an - hour wind in his face , wearing loafers and a trench coat			2
it was simply too risky			0
he also missed that his reserve chute was only for training and had been sewn shut -- something a skilled skydiver would have checked			0
" agents also believe @entity5 had no help on the ground			1
if he had had an accomplice , he would have needed to coordinate closely with the flight crew and jump at just the right moment			0
" but @entity5 simply said , ' fly to @entity17 , ' and he had no idea where he was when he jumped , " authorities said			1
" there was also no visibility of the ground due to cloud cover at 5,000 feet			0
" two flight attendants who were in contact with @entity5 gave nearly identical descriptions of him , as did those who encountered him on the ground			1
he was said to be between 5 foot 10 and 6 feet tall , weighing 170 to 180 pounds with brown eyes			0
@entity161 said in 2007 he believed it was unlikely @entity5 survived the jump			2
" diving into the wilderness without a plan , without the right equipment , in such terrible conditions , he probably never even got his chute open , " he said			0
by the five - year anniversary of the hijacking , the @entity2 said it had considered more than 800 suspects and eliminated all but two dozen from consideration			0
several high - profile suspects have been ruled out over the years			0
@entity208 , who claimed on his deathbed to be @entity5 , was eliminated by dna testing , the @entity2 said			2
another man , @entity211 , did not match the physical description and was a skilled paratrooper			2
a third , @entity223 , who died in 1974 , also did not match the description and was at home the day after the hijacking having @entity217 dinner with his family in @entity219 -- " an unlikely scenario unless he had help , " the agency said			2
@entity29 said while the @entity2 understands there is great public interest in this long - unsolved case " it 's a fairly low - priority case for the @entity2 " as it pursues new investigations involving cases like missing children that have a current impact on public safety			2
even so , @entity29 said the @entity2 always follows up on any new tips on the case			0
on sunday , another @entity2 spokesperson , @entity238 , told @entity1 the information on the new suspect is not expected to be " a big break in the investigation			0
" @entity1 's @entity243 contributed to this report .			0

family of new suspect offer access to dead man 's belongings

he jumped from the plane carrying a parachute and *pilfered* money
@entity5 has never been found and his fate is *unknown*
