-- global emissions of carbon dioxide hit a record high in 2011 , scientists from the @entity2 reported last week			1
another record is expected in 2012			2
the earth continues to warm , and to warm fast , with serious consequences for human life and welfare			0
2012 saw the worst drought in the @entity12 in half a century			1
@entity13 suffered its second bad drought in three years			0
climatic shocks to these two countries are raising food prices worldwide , posing an especially acute threat to the world 's poorest			2
major storm events strike harder and more often , because warming oceans create conditions for fiercer hurricanes			2
the @entity24 reported friday : " emissions continue to grow so rapidly that an international goal of limiting the ultimate warming of the planet to 3.6 degrees , established three years ago , is on the verge of becoming unattainable			2
" this ominous news arrives as delegates gather in @entity32 , @entity33 , for the latest annual round of climate talks sponsored by the @entity36			2
few expect the @entity32 talks to produce much decision			0
yet there is good news on the environmental front , important news			0
carbon emissions in the @entity12 have declined since 2009 -- not emissions per person ( those have been declining for decades ) , but emissions in absolute terms			1
the weak economy explains part of the decline , but the real hero of the story is the natural gas fracking revolution			2
a decade ago , half of all the electricity generated in the @entity12 was generated by burning coal , the most carbon - dense fuel of them all			1
today , coal 's share of the electricity mix has plunged to one - third , as utilities substitute cheap natural gas			2
gas production has become much cheaper with the growth of fracking -- forcing open rocks by injecting fluid into cracks			0
gas emits about half as much carbon per unit of energy as coal			0
environmentalists have responded warily to the advent of gas			0
they prefer zero - emissions power sources like wind and solar -- sources made more uncompetitive than ever by ultracheap natural gas			1
( today 's price : about $ 3.50 per thousand cubic feet , down about 70 % from the prices of the mid- 2000s			0
) moreover , natural gas does little ( as yet ) to address emissions from automobile tailpipes			0
but maybe there 's a way to cheer environmentalists up			0
take three worrying long - term challenges : climate change , the weak economic recovery , and @entity12 's chronic budget deficits			1
and suddenly three tough problems become one attractive solution			0
a tax of $ 20 a ton , rising at a rate of 4 % per year , would over the next decade raise $ 1.5 trillion , according to an important new study from the @entity106			0
that $ 1.5 trillion is almost twice as much as would be recouped to the @entity107 by allowing the expiration of all @entity110 - era tax cuts for upper - income taxpayers			1
the revenues from a carbon tax could be used to reduce the deficit while also extending new forms of payroll tax relief to middle - class families , thus supporting middle - class family incomes			1
meanwhile , the shock of slowly but steadily rising prices for fuel and electricity would drive economic changes that would accelerate @entity12 economic growth			1
the average age of @entity12 cars and trucks has reached nearly 11 years , a record			1
millions of @entity12 want new cars			1
they are waiting for market signals as to what car to buy			0
they want to know that if they choose a fuel - efficient vehicle , they wo n't feel silly three years from now when their neighbor roars past them in a monster truck because gas has plunged back to $ 2 a gallon			0
after five years of depression , the housing market is also ready for renewal			0
again , @entity12 are waiting for market signals : should they buy smaller houses nearer to work ? @entity147 and rising fuel prices will encourage developers to build more mixed - use complexes that allow more people to live car - free : walking to work , entertainment , and shopping			1
the surest way to reduce fuel costs is to drive less			0
the return to more urban living is a trend big enough to sustain @entity12 's next great economic boom			1
to the extent researchers can measure , the daily commute appears to be the single worst recurring source of unhappiness in @entity12 life			2
if changes in city shape can offer more @entity12 the opportunity to walk to work through an attractive shopping mall , rather than waste 50 minutes in a car in a traffic jam , those changes will advance human happiness , spur new construction work , and incidentally save the planet			2
a carbon tax will also enable the @entity12 and @entity178 to press @entity179 and @entity180 to reduce their carbon emissions			1
a properly designed tax would apply not only to domestic goods and services , but to imports as well			0
@entity179 and @entity180 would discover that their products no longer seem so cheap when a carbon tax at the border adds back the environmental costs of dirty manufacturing			1
to export to the world 's richest consumers , @entity179 and @entity180 will have to clean up their act -- an incentive more persuasive than a hundred @entity32 conferences			0
more jobs and growth ; reduced deficits without raising income taxes ; lower taxes for middle - class families ; a kick in the pants to @entity179 polluters ; and more happiness for @entity12 commuters -- one policy instrument can do it all			1
what 's not to love about a carbon tax ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

@entity215 : carbon dioxide emissions worldwide are at record levels
to strike a blow against climate change , @entity12 should enact a carbon tax , @entity215 says
he says it would provide revenue , allow for middle - class tax relief , spark economy
