-- scientists expect some great travel spots to be altered or ruined by global climate change			1
glaciers in the @entity6 may melt as soon as 2050 , some scientists say			1
some of the changes are already taking place			0
others are expected to be seen in coming decades			0
there are two ways to look at this : either stay home ( which might be less depressing and wo n't add more airline emissions ) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just ca n't miss. for those who want to head out , @entity0 got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from @entity23 , author of " the @entity24 to @entity25 " and a writer at the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
here are @entity23 's top five choices : @entity31 , @entity32 warming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs , which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays			1
many of the world 's reefs already are experiencing " bleaching " in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons			2
the @entity31 -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of @entity32 -- is seeing limited bleaching now , and the @entity49 expects the problem to grow in coming decades			0
@entity23 said the reefs ' colorful displays are not to be missed			0
" it 's a feast for the eyes in terms of color , texture variations -- it 's just amazing to see , " he said			2
" it 's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life			2
" boats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from @entity66 , @entity67			0
if you go , tread lightly , @entity23 said			0
visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close			0
@entity71 , @entity72 how much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation			1
if huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of @entity82 and the western shelf of @entity84 -- melt , then the rise is expected to be more dramatic			2
" nobody knows whether they 're going to completely melt or not , but we do know it 's not going to happen in the next 10 years , " @entity23 said			1
but for cities near the coast such as @entity71 , which already sits below sea level , rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike , even in the relative near term			1
" in the next several hundred years , life there may be difficult , and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay , " he said			2
@entity23 does n't expect @entity71 to be underwater anytime soon			1
but travel to the @entity72 city may become more difficult in the future , he said			1
scientists expect floods to become more frequent			0
" it 's sobering to be in @entity71 and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the @entity110 , " he said			1
" you 're standing below the level of the river , looking up			0
" @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity29 herds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at @entity29 's forests , turning the evergreens a sickly red and destroying large patches of trees			1
cold snaps -- which , in mountain terms , mean about five nights of minus - 30 temperatures -- usually kill off the native beetles			2
but winters are warming , and @entity23 and others said they worry the beetles ca n't be stopped			1
the beetle infestation " has reached epidemic proportions as a result of climate issues , " said @entity131 , spokeswoman for the @entity114			0
the beetles are causing problems all over @entity140 's mountainous west , but the issue is particularly visible at @entity131 's park , northwest of @entity143			1
@entity23 recommends visiting the park this decade to ensure you can still see the dense forests in decent shape			1
some of the reddened forests look beautiful in a strange way , @entity23 said , but visitors should note that the color is n't natural for pine trees			1
it 's happening quickly , " he said			2
visit in the summer or early fall and take a breathtaking drive to 12,183 feet , @entity131 said			0
or , come in the winter and enjoy snowshoeing and nearby skiing			0
many of the park 's 355 miles of hiking trails are open year - round			2
@entity162 , @entity163 the @entity6 sit at a lower altitude than the @entity165 , and their glaciers and ski resorts are therefore more susceptible to melting , @entity23 said			1
a climate expert in @entity170 recently told @entity171 that the @entity6 ' famed glaciers will disappear entirely between 2030 and 2050			1
a 2006 report had said they would melt by the end of the century			1
@entity23 said he once took a train through the @entity162 glaciers			2
they 're worth seeing before they go -- whenever that happens , he said			0
" they 're beautiful ; the light blue quality of the meltwater is really stunning , " he said			0
@entity185 rain forest , @entity186 deforestation continues to be the major environmental issue in the @entity185 , the world 's largest tropical rain forest			0
but as locals and corporations chop down the @entity185 's rich forests to create farmland and to harvest biofuels , climate change may make things worse			1
" the fear is that there will be kind of a feedback where trees are cut down , and it gets warmer and drier " in the forest until it ca n't grow back , @entity23 said			0
the best way to visit the forest is by boat , @entity23 said			0
that way , you 'll leave less of a mark on the struggling ecosystem			0
of course , getting to a boat on the @entity185 is not simple , and the long trip can create a lot of heat - trapping pollution			0
@entity23 said the destination might be one of those better left alone by tourists .			0

global warming may ruin many of nature 's wonders
rising sea levels could make visiting @entity71 difficult in the future
glaciers in the @entity6 may melt by the middle of the century
*encouraged* by warmer winters , pine beetles are ruining forests in @entity29
