-- three times as many asian - americans have been running for @entity3 in 2012 than in the past two elections , a nonpartisan political group says , and it 's a development that portends greater changes in demographic trends and reflects the recent political awakening of a minority group long confined to the margins of @entity13 society			1
" it 's extremely exciting , " says @entity14 , president and ceo of the @entity16			1
" we could really stand to gain seats and affect the balance of power in @entity3			0
" including @entity21 , 30 @entity22 launched campaigns for @entity3 this year , compared with 10 in 2010 and eight in 2008 , according to an @entity16 count			1
though several of the @entity22 candidates lost their primaries , others stand to become the first people of @entity22 descent in their respective states -- @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , for instance -- to join the legislative body			2
appearing on @entity0 sunday night , @entity13 rep. @entity37 , @entity38 , heralded this year 's election as a potential watershed moment for @entity22 in politics			1
" it 's a great step forward for all of us when the people who are making the decisions about @entity13 look like @entity13 , " said @entity42 , who in 2009 became the first @entity44 woman elected to @entity3			1
" i am so proud of these @entity22 who are now running			2
" @entity50 added that @entity22 ' surging involvement in politics could have reverberations far beyond @entity54			2
" for the @entity57 community , there 's always this stereotype -- we 're quiet , we do n't speak up , we do n't fight back when we 're made fun of , we 're nerds , etc. " @entity50 says			0
" it 's been difficult for @entity22 to break through those stereotypes			1
" opinion : will @entity65 's success in @entity66 end stereotypes ? but @entity50 is optimistic that the recent explosion of @entity22 in prominent positions could help dispel the stereotype and " shed light on what our communities are really about and the challenges we face			1
" having @entity22 in leadership roles , she said , could augment the group 's political voice			1
yet some experts noted that the campaigns also have the capacity to show the ugliness of @entity13 racism			2
" there 's always been this question , ' how @entity13 are @entity89 ? ' " says @entity85 , board president of @entity86			1
" a lot of politicians still play off of this : ' @entity22 , how much do we trust them ? where are their loyalties ? ' in districts where there is n't a lot of exposure , they can be defined in racial ways			2
" @entity85 added that , unlike some groups , @entity22 - @entity13 politicians face the additional difficulty of lacking an entrenched support network , noting that " it 's a community that 's still developing an infrastructure			1
" " i think there 's still a big learning curve			0
when you compare ( @entity22 ) to a community that has a pool of donors , a list of talking points -- i think there 's still a lot of work to be done , " he said			1
" but i think there 's a lot of opportunity , too , because these candidates are fresh			0
... we 're a new face , we 're not the standard politician you 've seen before			0
" rep. @entity128 , @entity38 , is an @entity22 elected to @entity3 in 2001 , and he agreed that some candidates try to leverage their opponents ' perceived foreignness into electoral advantage			1
" some will say this person has connections to @entity135 or @entity136			0
... there 's so much out and out blatant racism			0
in 2010 , there were a handful of politicians who used @entity44 or @entity22 languages in their commercials , " @entity144 said , though he added he had not yet seen similar bigotry in the 2012 races			1
@entity144 is no stranger to @entity150 sentiment in @entity13			2
just a toddler at the time , he and his parents were forced into a @entity136 internment camp during @entity154 -- a memory @entity144 says left an indelible imprint on his career and aspirations			0
he said that as he grew up , he increasingly understood the necessity for @entity22 to gain a political foothold			0
but that was difficult , if not impossible , for a population that represented a fraction of the population			0
that may be rapidly changing			0
according to a report released in june by the @entity167 , @entity22 - @entity13 are among the fastest - growing groups in the @entity13			1
in 2010 , 36 % of new immigrants to the @entity13 were @entity89 while 31 % were @entity171 , the study found			2
just a decade ago , 19 % of immigrants were @entity89 and 59 % were @entity171			0
the growth of @entity22 ' political clout tends to favor @entity174			0
of the 30 who filed to run in 2012 , 25 are @entity174 , according to @entity16			1
about 60 % of the diverse group -- which experts urge should not be considered a monolithic entity -- voted for @entity179 in 2008			0
their vote could prove crucial in some battleground states , where a growing and increasingly energized @entity22 - @entity13 voting bloc is realizing that -- at 6 % of the population -- they have significant political clout			1
" we used to be marginalized politically , but now people are understanding we 're the margin of victory , " @entity144 said			0
speaking with @entity0 's @entity191 on sunday , @entity42 expressed similar sentiments			0
" @entity22 are more enthusiastic than ever , and , in fact , five out of six look forward to voting in this election , " @entity42 said			2
" i think it 's because they really appreciate being @entity13			2
