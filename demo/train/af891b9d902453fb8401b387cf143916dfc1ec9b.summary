in december 2013 , photojournalist @entity1 set out to become the first person to walk the length of the @entity4			1
during his travels , he was robbed at gunpoint , evacuated out of a war zone and almost eaten by crocodiles			2
he crossed swamps , climbed mountains , cozied up to scorpions in the @entity13 desert , and dined on rat stew and grasshoppers			1
those months , he says , were the best of his life			1
" i 've always been interested in the stories of the great @entity20 explorers , like @entity21 and those guys , " admits @entity1			1
" this was an opportunity to try and do something that nobody 's ever done before , but really , it was an opportunity to explore @entity27 in the 21st century and see how things have changed and how they 've stayed the same			2
" @entity1 's journey began in @entity30 , took nine months and spanned 3,750 miles			1
it was necessary to make the trip on foot , he says , because " walking is the only way you can really get under the skin of a country			1
" occasionally , he was joined by a film crew from the @entity41 's @entity40 ( the network is planning to air a four - part documentary on his travels )			2
sometimes he traveled with a local guide			2
mainly , though , he walked it alone			1
" the biggest difficult was keeping up the motivation and momentum to wake up every morning , walk 20 miles , and do it over and over again , " he says			1
" at times , the monotony was crushing			2
@entity52 ( in @entity53 ) marked the halfway point , and the most difficult time was probably just before i reached it			2
i was n't halfway there and i still had 2,000 miles left to walk			1
that was pretty demoralizing , " he admits			2
the kindness of strangers @entity1 acknowledges that his survival was often dependent on the hospitality of local villagers , of which there was an abundance			1
the people of the @entity53 , he says , were probably the most giving of all			2
" it 's portrayed in the @entity71 media as this pariah state , and the government does leave a lot to be desired , but it had by far and away the most incredible hosts i 've ever encountered across the world , " he says			0
even sharing water , he says , demonstrated an incredible act of kindness -- given it 's a 20 - mile walk to the nearest source for many villagers			0
half the time he slept outdoors , while the other half he would lodge with a local			1
food was n't always a given			0
in @entity85 , he recalled a two - day period when he went without food completely			0
" my guide had a catapult , " he recalls			0
" he would shoot pigeons			0
we ate what we could catch			1
other times we 'd eat with villagers			0
the local delicacies could vary , from grasshoppers to rats			0
" out of harm 's way ( almost ) the journey was n't without danger			0
@entity100 in @entity53 broke out shortly after his arrival			0
as he ventured closer to the country , he started hearing tales of death , destruction , and a steady trail of fleeing refugees			0
he made it halfway through the country , to @entity112 -- the front line of the war			0
it was there that he was arrested and brought before an army commander , who told him he was not welcome , and threatened to kill him if he crossed into the rebel side			1
he was evacuated to the capital , and flew to @entity121			0
" i missed out 400 miles of the journey , but it was a sensible thing to do ; carrying on through would have been tantamount to suicide			1
" had he made the trip uninterrupted , he would likely have achieved a @entity126			1
now , he 's not so sure , though he says it does n't matter			0
" it was never about breaking records , it was about taking the biggest adventure in my life , and it was certainly that			0
" the finish line @entity1 's journey ended in @entity135 , where the @entity4 meets the @entity136			1
it was a cathartic moment , he says , and one that was bittersweet			0
" when you 're doing something every day for months and months , to see it end , there will be some sadness , " he admits			1
mainly , though , he remembers it as " one of the happiest days of my life			0
" " the first thing i did was run into the sea , and just enjoy the moment , " he says .			0
