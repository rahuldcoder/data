when i was in my 20s , a girlfriend surprised me by saying that we did n't have to worry about overpopulation because technology would make sure we always had what everyone needed			2
of course , economists have been saying this for decades			2
and of course , billions of people today do n't have what they need			1
because such people as my old girlfriend and economists presuppose that unlimited economic growth is necessary and also believe adding billions more humans to the world is desirable , i would like to share some thoughts about such thinkers , whom i 'll call " @entity19			1
" why do @entity19 think we should add billions more humans to the world ? do they want more consumers ? or is it something deeper , more biblical , more fruitfully multiplied ? all of the above ? whatever their impulse , compulsive craving for " no limits " to economic growth and human numbers is irrational			1
a finite planet comes with limits			0
the @entity32 expects the population to grow to about 9.6 billion people by mid-century ; that 's two more chinas			1
yet in @entity40 on saturday , april 26 , @entity39 expressed these views when he reassured us , " there are no limits because we can invent new ways of doing more with less			0
" he does n't see that this very acknowledgment undermines his premise			0
if limits do n't exist , why would we need to do more with less ? he continued : " @entity49 ... will run out one day , but only in the sense that you will run out of @entity52 one day if you take a rowboat west out of a harbor in @entity55			0
just as you are likely to stop rowing long before you bump into @entity56 , so we may well find cheap substitutes for fossil fuels long before they run out			0
" is it possible to think more incoherently about matters of such importance ? and as a mariner i must point out -- if only for safety -- that a rowboat far in the open ocean is a frail and vulnerable craft			0
another big blind spot in the unlimited growth view is the fact that other species also need to live here with us			1
but other creatures pay for our growth			1
meanwhile , populations of fishes , amphibians , mammals , reptiles and birds are all declining worldwide			0
species are going extinct about 1,000 times faster than the natural rate -- in other words , the rate it would be if humans were n't around			1
@entity90 's pursuit of growth obliterated the tall prairies , exterminated the continent 's most abundant birds and marginalized many mammals			1
an @entity96 of unlimited human growth will lose free - living elephants , apes and cats , natural landscapes and free - flowing rivers			1
it happens when farms and towns replace plains and forests			0
would farming @entity96 like we 've farmed the @entity109 solve @entity96 's problems ? food is n't @entity96 's only problem			1
already , @entity114 's planned dams threaten the nation 's own people and @entity117 who rely on @entity118 for water and food			1
competition and conflict always shadow the broad edges of humanity 's tent , and a bigger tent tends to inflame tensions			1
like all continents , @entity96 focused on growth would still have poverty , hunger and conflict			1
better to focus on reducing poverty , hunger and conflict			1
@entity135 and i agree that it 's great that farmers can grow more food on fewer acres than in the past			1
we disagree utterly on why it 's great			1
growing food with increasing efficiency could solve human hunger and the need to give space back to other animals who need it -- if humanity does n't continue to grow			1
but no - limits people want more food to feed more mouths			1
that keeps civilization on an endless @entity159 treadmill of running faster to stay in place			0
it means that more efficient food - growing accomplishes nothing			0
it means that more food will not end hunger			2
the @entity167 solved the food production problem of its time			0
it did not solve hunger because we did not achieve the family planning revolution needed with it			1
had we stayed for the main event -- stabilizing population -- the whole world might have reached a wonderful sweet spot in nutrition , health and security			1
what we got was billions more people and , consequently , more people living with hunger and poverty			1
more efficient technology and fewer people could help			2
but more people erase the benefits of technological efficiencies			2
we are forced toward more efficiency precisely because we 're scraping deeper into an emptying barrel			0
petroleum once ran out onto the ground in @entity194			0
people collected it ; they did n't even have to drill			2
hydraulic fracturing for shale gas was n't considered viable a decade ago because it 's difficult and expensive			2
economists and @entity19 say , " look , we have n't run out because technology saves us			0
" well , look , fracking is a symptom of hitting limits			0
technology is forced to keep up with the pace at which we are running out			0
that you still have some checks left does n't mean you 're not going bankrupt			0
fracking is postponing the switch to clean energy while the planet warms and oceans acidify			0
should n't we work now on what 's needed next ? digital tech saves us time			2
it does n't save elephants and apes , lions and tigers , bears and eagles , salmon and rivers , orchids and forests , giraffes and pandas , coral reefs and turtles			0
human growth dooms the animals we paint on nursery - room walls			2
different kinds of growth -- more poor people versus more affluent people -- doom them differently			1
economists can feel enthused about boosting unlimited growth only if they 're not worrying that our accomplishments continue to come at the expense of forests , grasslands , coral reefs , the ocean , other creatures , and native peoples			1
and what are the accomplishments of growth ? has the doubling of world population in my lifetime caused the world to become more peaceful and secure , kinder and more humane ? do we have computers and digital cameras and smartphones and @entity263 because there are billions more people than half a century ago ? no. we have them because engineers improve technology over time , not because the population has doubled			1
quantity is n't the same as better			0
life improves with qualities such as health , safety , love , family , community , and compassion			0
more stuff , more crowding , more competition , more profiteering -- and let 's be plain , profiteering is what economists ' growth - mania is always about -- is n't what makes life worthwhile			1
it 's only fair to poor people to let them in on the main secret of wealthy , educated and successful people : smaller families mean larger lives			1
in the happiest of coincidences , the thing that brings fertility down fastest happens to be the same thing that brings down poverty : educating girls			2
illiterate women bear three times as many children as do literate women , and their children tend to stay poor			0
meanwhile , each year of schooling raises women 's earning power by 10 % to 20 %			2
and when people are a little better off , they desire fewer children			2
gender and justice is always a good combination			0
for any pie , the biggest slices get cut at the least - crowded tables			0
the easiest , least expensive and most efficient way to have a bigger slice of the pie is to limit the number of guests you invite			0
most of us know that the secret to a big life is a small family			0
it works on a global scale , too			0
if you love your children , humanity and the world , you want to take the best possible care of them , not crowd them out of the house			2
growth for the sake of growth ? i do n't see the point .			2

@entity343 : some say *innovations* will solve problems of unlimited population growth
@entity32 expects world population to be 9.6 billion people by 2050 ; that 's two more @entity351
@entity343 : billions more people mean more people living with hunger and poverty , conflict
@entity343 : unlimited growth also *accelerates* the extinction of animal species , *environments*
