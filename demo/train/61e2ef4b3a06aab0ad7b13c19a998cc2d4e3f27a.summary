" if the previous owner admits it 's a mistake , and the fans all see it as a mistake then surely those who allow them to stay in control , like the @entity38 will realize that , " @entity44 told @entity0			0
" i think if anything it gives a bit more impetus to fans to ramp up the pressure on @entity8 and @entity7			2
it is about time they walked away			0
