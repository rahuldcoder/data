-- football ca n't do much to help the devastated communities along the @entity3 after @entity4			1
but this is what residents in dozens of towns are discovering this month : football players can			1
from @entity11 to @entity12 , from @entity13 to @entity14 , local high school teams are aiding the recovery effort with supplies , with support , and sometimes , with strength			1
that was the scene in @entity20 last weekend			1
more than a dozen members of the town 's undefeated high school team went door to door helping their neighbors			1
they carried out flood - ravaged debris to the curb , from couches to dressers to dining room furniture , and when they finished one house they would walk as a group to the next and start again			1
" i said to the kids when i texted them ( to organize the cleanup ) , the community has been so behind us , this is an opportunity for us , in a way , to say thank you , " said @entity33 , the team 's head coach			1
many of the players had done the same thing at their own homes earlier in the week			2
others were displaced , living in hotels or shelters , not sure where their families would settle long - term			2
this is the case up and down the @entity3 , the epicenter of the devastation from the unprecedented storm			2
the images on television days after , from the roller coaster from the @entity58 boardwalk sitting in the ocean to the boats piled up like toys on the streets , do not begin to sum up the damage			0
it is not just the beachfront mansions that took a beating here			0
it is the @entity68 and single - story ranch homes that are blocks away from the ocean that suffered devastating flooding			0
families who never experienced so much as a drop of water in their basements for decades were dealing with several feet of it , sometimes enough to make the houses unlivable			0
families who only lost possessions consider themselves lucky			0
@entity81 is a linebacker for the @entity20 team who lives five houses from the beach in @entity86 , @entity87			1
he left his home as the storm hit and still has n't returned -- and probably wo n't for a month			0
it could be up to a year before his house is livable again , which means as he finishes his senior year , he 's essentially homeless			1
the family is living in a hotel in a neighboring town			0
" i figured i 'd be safe and bring enough ( clothes ) for five days , " @entity81 said			0
" i was only off by 360			0
" still , @entity81 was one of the players who helped organize his teammates to help their neighbors			1
when the cheerleaders heard what the players had in mind , they came to help , too			0
one woman , who lives a block from the football field , broke into tears when the teenagers started streaming into her house to clean up			2
" the wins come and go , but what you did for people , that 's the stuff you do n't forget , " @entity33 said			2
" that 's more important			2
" how you can help @entity4 victims the efforts were not isolated to @entity20			1
in nearby @entity119 , which was hit hard with flooding , dozens of players met at a local church to unload three truckloads of supplies			2
then they shoveled sand that had washed up onto the streets into trash cans that they dragged back up to the beach			0
on it goes , with teams everywhere trying to help			2
a basketball team in @entity134 , @entity87 , far from the hardest - hit areas , organized a clothes and canned goods drive at halftime of its football game			1
two bitter rivals , @entity140 and @entity141 , were schedule to play last friday ; instead , the players came together and collected donations at a shopping plaza			0
" @entity151 and sports have been secondary right now , " said @entity146 , who had trouble tracking down his players in @entity149 because of spotty phone service			0
" it 's all about helping each other out and helping the community out			1
" the help extends beyond the high school level , too			1
@entity158 , the state university in @entity87 , and its athletic teams have gotten involved , planning to sell t - shirts with the state 's outline and the word " strong " at its game against @entity166 this weekend to benefit the @entity167			1
several athletes and athletic department officials also went to hard - hit @entity11 to unload supplies			0
@entity171 , the athletic director , saw a town where houses were literally torn in half during the storm			0
" people down here are hurting , " he said			0
" this is not just @entity158 people who need to help			0
the whole state of @entity87 needs to help			1
" professional teams have also contributed , from the $ 500,000 gifts from the @entity183 and the @entity184 to the personal visit to @entity186 , another coastal town , from @entity188 quarterback @entity187			2
@entity189 , the @entity183 quarterback who had flooding in his own @entity190 , @entity87 , apartment , helped unload supplies in @entity193			1
games will resume this weekend in some @entity87 towns			1
in other places , power still has n't returned to schools , leaving some coaches wondering when -- if ever -- their seasons might continue			0
but everyone recognizes this : what happens on the field is secondary			0
what happens off it , from the teenagers carrying seawater - drenched sofas to the curb to the professional teams writing checks , is already making an impact .			2
