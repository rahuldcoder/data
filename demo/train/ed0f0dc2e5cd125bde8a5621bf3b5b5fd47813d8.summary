@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the western town of @entity0 , rebel fighters stand their ground as government forces loom just yards away			1
but here , bullets are n't flying			0
that 's because the two sides have agreed to something remarkable -- a cease - fire			1
while fragile , the agreement could be a blueprint for peace across more parts of the country , which has seen incessant bloodshed for 23 months			1
if the local cease - fire continues to hold , it would defy failures at the national and international levels to implement a meaningful halt in violence			1
" we are for peace			2
we do n't want war			0
we are 100 % committed to peace , " said a rebel leader who goes by the name @entity29			1
" but if they want a war , we are ready for that			0
we did n't agree to the cease - fire out of weakness			1
we did it to protect the women and children			0
" @entity0 , near @entity1 's border with @entity40 was one of the first cities to rebel against the regime of president @entity45			1
it has seen heavy fighting since the uprising began			0
many civilians were forced to flee as government and rebel fighters battled in the streets			2
houses , pockmarked with signs of artillery fire , bear witness to the fierce clashes that raged here			2
the walls of buildings in the city center are still covered in revolutionary graffiti ; " @entity62 is great ! freedom , " one read and " down with the thug , " reads another			0
@entity1 opposition : @entity68 border blast was an assassination attempt but now @entity0 has become a model project of sorts			1
the cease - fire is a first step of a private " reconciliation initiative " led by a sheikh and a member of @entity1 's parliament			1
" before the agreement we reached , there were intense battles here			0
many civilians , militants and soldiers were killed , a lot of blood was spilled			0
after the agreement there have been some individual violations like a soldier opening fire ... but those have been dealt with straight away , " @entity87 said			2
" compared to the past this is a state of peace and security			1
" but many people in @entity0 say make no mistake -- this town is still under siege			1
while the opposition @entity100 controls @entity0 , the town is surrounded by regime troops			1
residents , surprised to see an international tv crew escorted by officials into their city , swarmed around the @entity2 team in the main square			0
more than a dozen people complained about harassment by government - backed militias known as " @entity112			2
" one man with his three young children said he could not leave the city out of fear government forces would detain him			0
another man said his two sons were among more than 400 @entity0 residents detained since the uprising			1
residents and fighters said they have had to create a makeshift graveyard close to the city center because regime troops have prevented them from reaching the main cemetery			2
@entity127 and some of his fighters gathered for prayers at the small garden where they recently buried their dead			0
he says three rebels have been killed since the cease - fire began			1
but signs of normalcy have sprouted amid the country 's prolonged civil war			2
some shops have reopened and the town center has come back to life			0
the governor of @entity143 , where @entity0 is located , described the city as once being " extremely dangerous and volatile , " but now he says he is able to visit and even meet with the militants			1
he says @entity0 is an experiment			1
" if the media and military support of terrorism is stopped ... i am convinced @entity143 will go back to what it was like within four months , " governor @entity150 said			0
while rebel and government forces keep their positions around town , an unusual meeting takes place between a parliamentarian and rebels			2
the parliamentarian , @entity162 , is an @entity163 -- the same sect of @entity164 that president @entity45 belongs to			2
but he 's accepted by the mostly @entity166 members of the @entity100			0
the men agree on almost everything : they do n't want a sectarian rift in @entity1 , they do n't want foreign jihadist fighters entering the country , and they say government thugs must be stopped from harassing the population here			2
@entity162 says the local cease - fire in @entity0 might work elsewhere			1
" we have already tried to apply this concept in areas of @entity179 ... so this can be applied anywhere in @entity1 , as long as there is no interference by other countries , " the parliamentarian said			0
still , both sides acknowledge , the fighting could reignite anytime			0
@entity187 a rebel commander who accuses regime troops of continued provocations , said : " we do n't kill people as a hobby ... the security forces in the area do n't want a truce			1
" and there 's one fundamental mission the rebels will not back down from			0
" our goal is to bring down the regime , " @entity199 said			1
" it 's impossible to change that -- impossible to back down from that goal			0
" @entity187 says the men in his city were forced to arm themselves after peaceful demonstrations were met by violence from regime forces			0
" if we achieve what we want -- [ to ] bring down the regime through peaceful means -- we are ready to lay down our arms for peace , " @entity187 said			1
@entity1 artist 's vision of love amid devastation of war goes viral @entity2 's @entity220 contributed to this report .			0

the cease - fire was *brokered* with the help of a sheikh and a member of parliament
" compared to the past , this is a state of peace and security , " the sheikh says
the parliamentarian says the cease - fire in @entity0 could spread across the country
but a rebel stands firm in his stance : " our goal is to bring down the regime "
