@entity0 -- airplane manufacturer @entity2 builds some of the most complicated machines on @entity4 , but in its efforts to make wireless signals on airplanes better it turned to the produce aisle for help			1
wednesday the company announced a " breakthrough " in the procedures it uses to evaluate wireless signals in cabins , saying in a news release the tests make " it possible for passengers to enjoy more reliable connectivity when using networked personal electronic devices in the air			1
" the new procedures come , in part , thanks to 20,000 pounds of potatoes that were piled in the seats of a decommissioned plane used for the tests			1
the tubers mimic the way the human body responds to electronic signals , so engineers at @entity2 's @entity34 used the spud - filled plane to try out the new methods without requiring hundreds of people to sit in the aircraft			1
once the engineers had the methods down , they were able to replace the starchy veggies and validate the data with humans			0
@entity2 says the procedures it developed can reduce the time it takes to test wireless signals from two weeks to just 10 hours			1
" one of the wonderful aspects of our improved testing is that we can describe both strong and weak signals with incredible accuracy , " @entity2 spokesman @entity45 said in a statement to @entity1			2
" engineers who are concerned primarily with operational safety of an airplane can see if the strong signals are safe for the airplane 's communication and navigation systems			0
meanwhile , an engineer who is concerned with getting every passenger a really good network signal can see if the weak signals are propagating through the airplane with enough power to provide a good usability experience			2
" most @entity67 are familiar with wi - fi @entity69 connections provided on airplanes , but the @entity71 and the @entity72 have prohibited @entity67 airlines from allowing cell phones in flight due to concerns about interference			0
some countries do allow cell phone use on board planes with specially designed cell phone receivers , devices which @entity2 sells and installs			2
" we can actually apply this kind of testing to just about any signal , " spokesman @entity45 said			0
" this is more than just wi - fi testing			0
we can test for safety and usability for all manner of personal electronic devices that might get used on an airplane			0
" as for the potatoes that were used in the tests , @entity2 says they were donated to a food bank .			1

@entity2 tests new methods to provide wireless signals to passengers
instead of *loading* a plane with people for the tests , it piles in potatoes
the tubers mimic the way the human body responds to electronic signals
