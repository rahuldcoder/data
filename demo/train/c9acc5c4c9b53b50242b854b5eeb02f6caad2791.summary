@entity0 -- some call the @entity3 " @entity4 for geeks			1
" on the eve of the largest gadget conference on earth , @entity1 was here in @entity0 to figuratively shake the presents under the tree and eavesdrop on gift givers to try to figure out what will define this year 's show			1
many companies will be unwrapping their big - ticket items at their own news conferences on wednesday , with still more to debut at the @entity18 starting thursday			1
in the meantime , we put together a list of gadgets and applications that stood out from the crowd at the pre-show events on tuesday			1
a @entity28 - @entity27 mutant tablet - laptop tablets are hot , and @entity31 computer maker @entity30 managed to draw crowds to its booth at @entity3 unveiled with one of its own			1
the @entity37 hardware is a spitting image of @entity40 's @entity39 , but the software is anything but			2
the touch - screen tablet runs a version of @entity45 's @entity27 that 's been heavily retooled and not necessarily for the better			1
it splits the application list into two tabs : work and play			1
the former consists mostly of productivity software , and the later has a heavy focus on multimedia			2
but the @entity37 is rooted in @entity30 's comfort zone			2
the tablet acts as the screen for a @entity59 hybrid laptop running @entity60			2
users can then detach the @entity37 from the clamshell hardware to tote it as a touch - screen gadget			1
the transition from the @entity27 software to the more desktop - centric @entity60 can be jarringly slow			1
but this is a prototype			2
the final version will be available in @entity31 first and in other countries later			2
the @entity37 was one of the only tablets we got to touch on tuesday , but expect plenty more in the next couple of days			1
we 've already had sightings of some from @entity74 and @entity75			0
a blood pressure reader that tweets @entity77 is in the business of connecting unexpected stuff to the internet			0
its break - out product , a @entity83 - enabled bathroom scale , lets people post their current weight directly to @entity86 and @entity87			1
on tuesday , the company announced a smartphone - connected blood pressure monitor that transfers home blood pressure readings onto the @entity92			1
users then can send that data to a doctor , personal trainer and friends on social networks			0
the app charts a person 's blood pressure over time , giving doctors more - granular data about a patient 's health and letting the product 's users watch these changes , too			1
the effects of stress , eating and exercise on a person 's health start to materialize in the app 's charts , letting users see otherwise invisible connections , said @entity77 ceo @entity117			0
this became apparent as @entity117 demonstrated the device during a pre-ces event for the media			0
his blood pressure at this high - stress event : 119/78			1
the day before : only 100/66			0
the @entity124 will be available at the end of the month and is expected to cost $ 129			0
ski goggles that shoot hd video making a home movie of a ski trip used to be a dangerous endeavor -- one that requires skiers to hold a camcorder in a mitten while looking through a tiny camera viewfinder and careening down the hill			1
while it 's not the safest of practices , some new products are making this high - speed art more practical			1
a new pair of ski goggles from @entity145 is equipped with a high - def video camera between the eyes			1
click one button on the side of the lenses to turn the camera on			1
click another to start shooting			0
a tiny blue light inside the goggles tells you it 's working			1
" i can see it 's recording , but it 's not going to distract me , " @entity156 said as she demonstrated that feature on tuesday			0
" so i 'm not going to get distracted and run into a tree or something			0
" the ski and snowboard goggles are expected to sell for $ 250 to $ 400 ( you get 1080p resolution at the top of that range ) and will hit stores later in january			2
an app for tv socializing software generally is n't a hot commodity at @entity3			1
but we found a bunch of app developers showing their wares at the pre-show events			1
one standout is called @entity179			0
the @entity39 app is a self - contained social network for television junkies			2
plenty of apps are targeting tv fans , including @entity186 and @entity187			0
with @entity179 , in addition tying into personalized @entity87 and @entity86 feeds , it has functions for text - chatting with friends during a show and a very attractive channel guide			1
for the tv obsessive , trying to talk shows on more generalized social networks -- like @entity87 and @entity86 which are sometimes called " horizontal " networks -- can be a challenge			0
" horizontal really bothers me , " @entity179 co-founder @entity198 told @entity1 on tuesday			0
" adding to @entity179 's @entity39 app , the company released a version for @entity92 last week , with a revamped website and @entity27 app on the way			0
a small speaker that likes to lay flat tiny speakers usually lack one quality : rich bass sounds			0
wowee one speakers aim to address this shortfall by turning their surroundings into musical instruments			0
set the company 's @entity92 - sized speaker on a desk , coffee table or even a surfboard and it transfers sound waves into that material -- creating an on - the - fly subwoofer			2
@entity224 , ceo of @entity225 , which makes the speakers , demonstrated the concept on tuesday by playing a bass - guitar - heavy section of " @entity230 " it sounded tinny and small until he set the device down on a table			2
then you could feel deeper vibrations			0
he proceeded to stick the gadget on all sorts of surfaces -- glass , metal , rock , an elevator wall -- like a doctor with a stethoscope			0
each gave a different tone			2
" a surf board 's great " as a subwoofer , he said , " but a skateboard is n't so great because there are layers of wood with glue in the middle			0
" a special gel inside the speaker transfers the sound smoothly , he said			0
@entity258 speakers , which connect to any gadget with a headphone jack , sell for about $ 80 to $ 90			0
a thinner version of the product is coming out soon , @entity224 said .			0

several companies gave sneak peeks at wares they *'ll* be showing off at @entity3
more *goodies* will show up in the next few days once @entity3 kicks off
in the meantime , we got to play with tweeting appliances and camera - equipped goggles
