-- nineteen elite firefighters died fighting the @entity3 wildfire last month , and over the past few weeks , there has been an outpouring of support for their families			1
but what happens when the cards , letters and casserole dishes quit coming ? that 's where @entity13 and her team come in			1
@entity13 , a 2008 @entity16 , created the @entity17 to provide emergency funds and long - term assistance to families who often have nowhere else to turn			1
@entity13 arrived in @entity21 , @entity22 , shortly after the tragedy and has already provided financial assistance to 12 of the 19 families			1
on tuesday , for example , she mailed a check to a grieving mother in @entity29 so that the mother could attend her son 's funeral			2
this kind of rapid response is the foundation 's specialty			2
" when a firefighter dies in the line of duty ... their benefits are n't immediately available , " said @entity37 , @entity13 's son			1
" we know the bills keep coming			0
" the group 's plan is to eventually connect with all of the families of the @entity48 and offer them assistance , whether it 's for immediate needs such as flights or hotels or for long - term needs such as housing or medical expenses			2
" they 're in a tremendous amount of pain , " @entity13 said			2
" it 's hard enough to lose one			0
but when you lose 19 that are tight -- a brotherhood -- it 's a domino effect			0
" the men who died were part of an elite team of wildland firefighters known as hotshots -- one of just 109 such crews in the @entity72			1
wildland firefighters are a group , @entity13 says , that tends to be scattered throughout the country , and their work often takes them far from home			1
" our firefighters are nomadic , " she said			0
" some of them are from @entity80 , some of them are from @entity83			0
they 're not usually in one town , and rarely do they ever die in the town they are ( from )			0
" the fact that crews are so often spread out makes her services even more necessary , @entity13 says			2
her group receives private donations , predominantly from other wildland firefighters			1
the assistance not only helps families get through hard times , it helps them feel that they are still a part of the wildland firefighter community			2
" we do long - term recovery with them , " she said			0
" we keep them connected for as many years as they need to be with us			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity16 she hopes to unite the families of the 19 with others who have also lost loved ones , so they can help provide emotional support			1
these are " people who 've really been there , ( who ) understand ... like no one else can , " she said			0
" they 're going to help these families a lot			0
we 've got women and family members who will be supporting these people after everything calms down			0
" for @entity13 , who got involved with the wildland firefighter community more than two decades ago , it 's a labor of love			1
since 1999 , her nonprofit has helped thousands of firefighters and their families and raised more than $ 2 million to assist them			1
she plans to keep doing the work as long as she can			0
" i will do anything to protect them and help them , " she said			0
if you 'd like to get involved and help the families of the fallen firefighters , visit the @entity17 or one of several firefighter charities listed on @entity140 .			1
