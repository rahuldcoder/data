-- the gruesome images circulated by the @entity2 in @entity3 and @entity4 might have grabbed the headlines in recent weeks , but the group is merely the latest in the @entity8 world to try to manipulate @entity9 for their own ends			1
from the days of the first @entity9 dynasty , ruling elites in the @entity9 world have co-opted religion to advance their interests , a trend that has continued hand - in - hand with a willingness to use the state security apparatus whenever necessary			1
but despite the depressing videos of beheadings supposedly undertaken in the name of @entity9 , there is growing pushback from moderate voices			1
the @entity26 may be on hold , but what i call an @entity9 @entity30 is still very much alive			2
there are almost half a billion @entity33 speakers around the world , but in its early incarnations , the arabic - language @entity35 was dominated by conservative , @entity39 and @entity40 radical content			1
indeed , what struck me most during my years as a counterterrorism researcher was the ease with which one could access hundreds of thousands of extremist texts			2
@entity46 , for example , offered free - of - charge audio and video libraries			2
the @entity51 , for its part , offered numerous free online libraries			2
even conservative religious books , rather than radical texts , were just more readily available online than secular - leaning content			0
reform - oriented voices , meanwhile , were pushed underground , intimidated by the political and religious alliance confronting them			1
but pushed underground did n't mean not read , a point underscored by research i was involved with in 2008 as part of a study with the @entity66 indeed , we marveled at the fact that many of these banned books were widely circulating , despite the fact that they were extremely difficult to obtain			0
fast - forward to today , though , and many of these once - hard - to - find publications are readily available with a click of a mouse			0
so what happened ? unsurprisingly , technology has played a key role , rendering censorship ineffective			1
as recently as 2010 , when i was undertaking doctoral research on liberal @entity9 thought , i toured every major bookstore in @entity86 and could not find a single book by secularist @entity4 intellectual @entity88			0
now , however , pirated versions of his banned books , including " @entity92 , " are available online			0
but while it is interesting to note how online sharing has extended to books written by current @entity9 scholars , it is particularly fascinating how quickly access has improved to translated works such as those of @entity101 and biologist @entity102			0
@entity8 young people now have access to a well of thought not only from their own heritage but from the global community			1
and while the @entity35 has expanded as a source of material , it has also , crucially , stimulated debate and discussion of issues , which has in turn generated even greater interest			2
the free debate of ideas was generally rare in classrooms in much of the @entity8 world , where education has tended to be based on rote memorization			1
the religious revolution has been particularly obvious on @entity124 , with pages such as @entity126 ( nonsense of @entity126 ) , referring to one of the chief collectors of the @entity131 's hadith , or oral tradition			1
the administrators of the page highlight contradictions in the hadith attributed to the @entity131 , unearthing all - but - forgotten episodes of @entity9 history and sparking impassioned debate with every new post			2
and , far from insulting @entity9 , such pages urge readers to discover the truth for themselves , often linking to original texts in the process			0
another forum , @entity147 ( @entity148 ) , which calls for a separation of mosque from state , has over 2 million participants			0
such numbers are only likely to grow on the back of greater internet access			0
businessman and entrepreneurship guru @entity156 noted in " @entity158 : the @entity159 " that social media usage is growing by about 125 % a year in the @entity8 world , a reality that has encouraged intellectuals to engage with @entity8 youth directly on issues such as reform and enlightenment			1
many of these thought leaders are producing and uploading their own shows onto @entity171 , reaching and interacting directly with their target audience			1
indeed , @entity171 has become a sort of official tv channel for the @entity8 masses			1
@entity176 , a @entity177 physician who grew up in @entity178 , delves deep into @entity9 to find and highlight humanistic messages of love , pluralism and tolerance			0
and while his sermons are sometimes delivered to just a few dozen followers in a small mosque in @entity187 , hundreds of thousands of people are watching and downloading his sermons over the @entity35			0
similarly , a group of @entity191 young men and women created a show on @entity171 entitled " @entity194 " ( " @entity195 " )			1
@entity196 , its charismatic creator , advocates freedom of conscience for all and calls for such freedom to be included in the @entity191 constitution			0
with well over 70 episodes , the show has seen its following grow , forcing several official television stations to report on its audacious ideas and interview some of the self - proclaimed atheists			2
despite their diverse backgrounds and points of view , what is noticeable about these thought leaders is their humanist and secular perspective , their vast knowledge of both @entity216 and @entity217 thought and the creative , sometimes audacious , ways in which they present their messages to @entity33 speakers			0
like the scholars of the classical age of @entity9 , many of these intellectuals are physicians , engineers , lawyers and scientists able to engage with young people in debates in a way in which traditional theologians are often unwilling to tolerate			0
all this suggests that although the @entity26 has disappointed many in the region who might have been hoping it heralded a new era of openness and tolerance , the long - term prognosis is actually extremely encouraging			2
groups like @entity242 might be grabbing headlines with their use of social media to circulate outrageous images , but the one - sided dissemination of hateful speech is no match for the more moderate voices able to engage in a free flow of debate and dialogue that is winning over many in the region , especially young people			1
these more moderate views are underscored in polling by @entity258 , which showed , for example , declining support for suicide bombing in @entity262 ( from a high of 57 % believing it can be justified in 2005 to 15 % this year ) and @entity263 ( where the number seeing it as acceptable dipped from 74 % in 2002 to 29 % this year )			1
the impact of the @entity266 might be more subtle , and the results might not be as visually dramatic as those of the @entity26			0
but in the long run , it may have a more lasting impact in undermining the extremists and state puppets of religion .			0

tech rendered censorship *largely* ineffective in @entity8 world , argues @entity279
social media usage is growing by 125 % a year in the region , by one estimate
@entity286 voices are taking to @entity124 and @entity171 to debate ideas , @entity279 says
