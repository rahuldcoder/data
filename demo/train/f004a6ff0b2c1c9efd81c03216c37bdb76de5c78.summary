@entity0 , @entity1 -- journalists often get invited on tours of battle zones during wars , but the one the @entity1 government organized for @entity2 and several other media outlets wednesday was more than bizarre			1
we had been told we were going on a trip to the front line in @entity12			0
instead , we were driven to an airfield and packed into an old @entity16 - made @entity15 aircraft			0
it was n't until we were in the air that government officials on the flight finally offered up some information			1
" we are going to @entity0 , " one said with a smile			1
he told reporters that ours would be the first civilian aircraft to land at the city 's international airport since december 2012 , when the airfield was shut because of heavy clashes in the area			1
we sat still , slightly nervous about the guinea pig role we had been thrust into by the government , as our pilot performed a spectacular combat landing on a foggy day			2
as the aircraft taxied toward the terminal we finally realized that we were the news of the day			0
a live transmission vehicle and dozens of reporters were waiting to greet us as @entity40 carried the live banner proclaiming " the reopening of @entity43 and the landing of a commercial flight			2
" exclusive : gruesome photos could prove torture by @entity49 regime @entity50 , @entity0 's provincial governor , was on hand to greet us , eager to show us the gains that @entity1 forces had made in and around the city -- and also talk about the ongoing negotiations in @entity56 between representatives of @entity1 president @entity49 's government and various opposition factions			1
" what we want from @entity61 is to stop foreign money , fighters and weapons coming into @entity1			2
we as @entity1 can reconcile with each other , make our own government to rebuild our country , " he said			1
three buses picked us up for a tour of areas the military had recently taken back from rebels			2
@entity0 and its surrounding areas are a key battleground in @entity1 's hard - fought , nearly three - year - old civil war			1
the killings have been far too numerous to count			0
in december , overwhelmed doctors scurried to help scores of patients amid days of air raids by the government			0
" there was a big massacre today , " dr. @entity85 told @entity2 at the time			2
" we were treating shrapnel wounds , deep abdominal and brain injuries			0
i just lost count of the amputations			0
" for a long time it appeared opposition forces might take full control of @entity1 's largest city			1
but infighting among various rebel groups and a resurgent @entity1 army has reversed momentum			1
the government soldiers we spoke with sounded confident and emboldened by their recent gains			2
" @entity104 were the worst people to fight against			0
they are @entity109 , they see us as infidels and they want to kill us , " one soldier said			0
as the buses drove us to the town of @entity114 near the airport , people lined the streets , chanting @entity118 slogans			0
we were not sure how spontaneous this show of affection really was			0
we were taken to an aid distribution center before the tour took us to regime - held areas of @entity0			1
@entity124 : haunting images of @entity0 's abandoned homes the city has the same remarkable dynamic as many other @entity1 cities during the civil war , including @entity131 and @entity12			1
as the mortars boom and machine guns crackle during heavy clashes in many parts of town , other neighborhoods seem totally normal , to an almost absurd extent			0
the @entity139 and other international groups accuse @entity1 regime forces of using heavy weapons against civilian areas , including barrel bombs -- oil drums filled with explosives that cause massive destruction wherever they are dropped			1
but in many government - controlled parts of the city , just a few blocks from the fighting , the streets are full of people and the shops are well stocked			1
there are trendy restaurants and @entity159 , even as rebels control almost half of the city			2
@entity1 officials believe that @entity0 could be a model for a ceasefire between regime and rebel forces			1
but looking over the skyline , it is easy to see just how hard that will be			0
at a sniper position atop of one of @entity0 's tallest buildings , soldiers showed us areas under opposition control			1
some are held by the moderate @entity180 , or the newly - constituted and moderate @entity181			0
but others are under the control of the @entity184 ( @entity184 ) , the @entity104 - linked group which is battling against other rebel factions in its bid to set up an @entity184 caliphate in @entity1			1
@entity0 offered many surprises before we climbed back into our rickety old @entity190 at the end of the day			2
but it still seems that a ceasefire in the city is a long way off , even if the @entity61 negotiations go well			0

@entity2 's @entity199 was taken on a surprise trip to @entity0 , one of the war 's *flashpoints*
@entity1 government - organized flight was first civilian landing at airport since late 2012
@entity1 forces have *retaken* many areas of country 's largest city from rebels in recent months
much of city remains in rebel hands and a ceasefire *anytime* soon seems unlikely
