-- the families of the victims of a mass shooting rampage on a @entity5 island are visiting the scene friday , a month after two attacks plunged the @entity9 nation into mourning			1
sixty - nine people died july 22 on @entity4 , where hundreds of mostly young people were gathered for a summer camp held by the youth wing of the governing @entity15			0
eight others died in the bombing of @entity19 government buildings hours earlier			0
tv footage showed the first group of relatives of victims of the shooting walking in line as they arrived on @entity4 in the rain			2
" it is a very important and emotional day for these families , " health minister @entity27 said , according to @entity5 's official @entity29 news agency			0
a policeman will show each family where their loved one was found after the attack , @entity29 reported			0
the families will also be accompanied by @entity39 representatives			0
many of the 69 families affected have said they plan to visit the island over the weekend , @entity5 reports say			0
meanwhile , a judge ruled that @entity45 , the man accused of carrying out both attacks , should be held in solitary confinement for another four weeks because there was a real danger he would otherwise tamper with evidence			1
this was especially important because the police have still not established whether @entity45 had accomplices , judge @entity51 said			1
he told the court in @entity19 that the police request for @entity45 to remain in isolation outweighed the suspect 's concerns			1
@entity45 , 32 , had told the court that being held in isolation is " boring , monotonous and a sadistic method of torture , " the judge said			1
@entity45 appeared in court to hear the arguments but the session was not open to the public or media			2
he will remain in solitary confinement until september 19 , @entity51 said			0
at an initial court appearance for @entity45 last month , the police were granted eight weeks ' custody , four of them in isolation			1
suspects are not normally held in isolation for longer than two weeks in @entity5 , according to local media reports			0
speaking after @entity45 's court appearance , @entity78 - @entity77 of @entity79 told reporters that the suspect was being kept cuffed by his hands and feet , and also chained at the waist			2
he said several survivors of the @entity4 massacres had wanted to be present at the court hearing , but that the police had decided it was too risky in case they unwittingly revealed details of the case that would enable @entity45 to alter his explanations			1
the police instead allowed four of the 113 lawyers representing the survivors , victims and their families to be present at the hearing , @entity77 said			0
survivors may be allowed in court when the investigation is no longer at such a sensitive point , he said			0
@entity77 also responded to questions about the revelation by police thursday that @entity45 had made two calls to the police while on @entity4 on july 22			1
officers had not called @entity45 back because they say no number came up on their display			1
the most likely explanation for this is that the phone was not equipped with a sim card or subscriber identity module , @entity77 said , which would have transmitted the phone 's number			0
police chief @entity118 on thursday confirmed that @entity45 had made two calls , one to @entity121 district and another to @entity122			1
according to a police transcript of the calls , @entity45 said : " hello , my name is commander @entity45 of the @entity5 anti-communist resistance movement			1

" @entity77 said @entity45 had been questioned for a total of 60 hours			2
he has not been questioned this week but questioning will resume next week			0
it is too early to tell what the final charges against @entity45 will be , @entity77 added , as the police are still systematically collecting and evaluating evidence and information			1
@entity45 's lawyer said his client was concerned about appearing smart and respectably dressed for friday 's court appearance , state broadcaster @entity136 reported			2
