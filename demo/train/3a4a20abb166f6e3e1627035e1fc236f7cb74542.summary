-- @entity5 explorer @entity3 finished his two - year , 4,000 - mile trek along the @entity7 on monday , completing a feat never before accomplished , his publicist said			1
the hike , which he started at @entity10 , @entity11 , on april 2 , 2008 , ended monday at @entity12 , @entity13			2
four months after he started , he was joined by @entity11 forestry worker @entity14			0
@entity15 intended only to guide @entity3 for five days through a dangerous area near @entity17 , @entity11 , but stayed to the end of the expedition			1
the 859 - day journey took @entity3 through three countries and a place in his body and soul he never imagined			1
" i 'm more tired and more elated than i 've ever been in my life , " @entity3 said in a release			1
" we 've lived through some very serious situations and there have been times when we genuinely feared for our lives , but we never ever thought of giving up			0
the fact that everyone told us it was impossible spurred us on			0
" at first it was terrifying but it 's changed in our eyes during the expedition and a place that was once mysterious and dangerous to us is now a place where we feel safe			2
we 've never had more relaxed evenings than when we sit in the middle of the jungle alone around the campfire			0
it 's not a scary place for us now ; it 's beautiful ; we 've fallen in love with it and it feels like home			2
" despite collapsing from exhaustion on a roadside sunday morning , @entity3 had been confident he would finish in time monday to catch a scheduled flight home to @entity54 , @entity55			1
" feeling much better , " he wrote in a blog post from northeastern @entity13 on sunday , after catching three hours of sleep			0
" ... will walk all night from now to complete the remaining 85 kilometres			2
" it 's the kind of fortitude that @entity3 has summoned time and again since setting out from the @entity7 's @entity7 source to raise international attention about rain - forest destruction and to help raise funds to combat it			1
along the epic trek , the two men encountered pit vipers , electric eels , anaconda , mosquitoes and scorpions , but very few doubts about whether they 'd reach the @entity74			0
" after grabbing something to eat , and replying to emails i finally got my head down at 1:27am , " @entity3 wrote in a piece for @entity0 last week , after hiking for 15 straight hours			1
" we 've never walked 55km in a day before so we are satisfied with what we 've achieved , if a little stiff			0
" @entity3 's mother , @entity81 , said monday she did not spend " an awful lot " of time worrying about her son			1
" i only got hear about the bad stuff that had happened only after it had happened , " she told @entity0			0
" i ca n't say there was ever a second when i thought he would n't make it unless something dire happened			0
" @entity3 , a former @entity5 army captain , and his hiking buddy have seen their share of setbacks			1
@entity3 contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis , a skin disease , and had to have a botfly removed from his skull			1
@entity15 suffered a nasty machete cut			0
but their biggest challenges were far less dramatic			0
" although everyone would like me to say that the hardest thing has been our encounters with ( indigenous residents ) pointing bows and arrows at our chest , for me that was n't the hardest part , " @entity3 told @entity0 last month			1
" the adrenalin kicks in and you deal with exciting , potentially dangerous moments like that easily			0
" " it 's been the mundane that had really challenged me , " he said			2
" the weight of the rucksack , the basic food , the constant mosquito bites , the constant thorns			0
the little things that in a two - day expedition would n't bother you have been the things that have actually been challenging			0
" the greatest pleasures of the journey , @entity3 said , have been the warmth of the @entity13 people , with village children frequently welcoming him and @entity15 to new towns and their parents offering home - cooked meals			1
having never visited the @entity7 before starting his expedition , @entity3 says his quest to save the region wo n't end with his hike			2
" i 'm committed now to this place for the rest of my life , " he wrote on @entity0 this month , " and i intend to take ' walking the @entity7 ' around the world and keep alive the stories of the people we 've met along the way , the lives in the @entity7 and the tale of the jungle			2
" though he says that deforestation means the @entity7 " is changing faster than many of us can comprehend , " @entity3 has also found reasons to be hopeful about its survival while hiking			1
" although ( deforestation ) is still going on in the moment , " he told @entity0 , " there 's a generation coming through @entity13 that are very aware of environmental issues and really do care about the @entity7			2
" as he closed in on the @entity7 's mouth , @entity3 found time to nurse less lofty desires			1
he said the first thing he 'll do after touching down in @entity55 is grab a pint of beer			0
and his @entity11 partner , he says , ca n't wait for a pint of fresh milk			0
back in @entity55 , @entity3 's mother told @entity0 she will fix him a favorite meal when he gets back -- shepherd 's pie .			1

new : @entity3 said he 's " more tired and more elated " than ever in his life
new : his mother says she never doubted he would finish
@entity3 set out to become the first person to walk all of the river 's roughly 4,000 miles
