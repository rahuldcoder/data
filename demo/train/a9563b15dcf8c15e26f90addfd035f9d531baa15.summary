@entity166 , a 16 - year - old from @entity167 , posted , " i hate to see him lose his job , but what he did really was illegal ; those pictures were not his , since he took them for his employer			0
therefore , legally speaking , he stole the picture , and published it			0
i guess it depends how his contract was set up , but i think all copyrights would have been given over to the state			0
