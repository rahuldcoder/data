@entity0 , @entity1 -- since the @entity3 chose to host their convention in @entity5 , @entity6 , in a state that has not been hospitable to unions , organized labor is going to have a rally to focus attention on its key issues in @entity13 on august 11			1
the rally is meant to send a message to the @entity18 leadership , as well as to @entity19 , that many workers feel as if they do n't have a voice in the two - party system			1
as @entity33 president @entity32 said to members , the rally will " give us an opportunity to connect the faces of ordinary @entity24 to the basic issues affecting working people in our country while providing an important liftoff to our @entity29 2012 political program for the fall			1
" the rally is indicative of a larger tension that has plagued the @entity18 coalition for several decades			1
since the 1960s , organized labor , once the pillar of the @entity18 , has often been taken for granted or even treated with hostility			0
@entity43 @entity19 block @entity44 for 2nd straight day @entity46 leaders frequently complain that they have second - class status in the party compared with other groups such as environmentalists or suburban voters			0
during the battle over public employee unions in @entity54 , most national @entity3 were noticeably absent from the debate			1
before the @entity54 gubernatorial election that followed the recall , president @entity56 was willing to tweet his support for gov. @entity61 's opponent , @entity62 , but unwilling to actually visit			1
this fissure has high costs for the @entity3 and for liberalism more generally			2
organized labor has been integral to the organizational strength of liberalism throughout the 20th century , as the most reliable and powerful force to get out the vote in elections and to help build congressional coalitions behind progressive legislation			2
the alliance , which formed when the @entity33 helped president @entity75 during the early stages of @entity77 , flourished during the @entity78			0
@entity3 won the support of workers as a result of the surge of legislation that helped working - and middle - class @entity24 find economic security			1
the @entity86 ( 1935 ) cemented this marriage as the federal government legitimated the right of workers to organize in unions			0
@entity29 leaders like @entity92 from the @entity93 , who helped found the cio , established the first political action committee to help @entity97 win re-election in 1944			2
during @entity101 , most of the major unions were a key part of the homeland effort , assisting the administration as it moved to convert factories to wartime production			0
in 1948 , president @entity107 would not have won re-election had it not been for organized labor , which in the final weeks of the campaign mobilized its troops to defeat @entity112 gov. @entity111			0
" @entity29 did it ! " cried @entity107 , who won the vote of 89 % of the automobile workers , recounted historian @entity116			2
although a @entity19 was in the @entity117 for most of the 1950s , organized labor helped a growing number of @entity3 win office in the @entity117 and @entity43			1
they promoted proposals for civil rights and health insurance for the elderly that gradually gained support in the @entity117 and @entity43			0
in addition to supporting @entity132 's @entity132 's election campaign in 1964 , the @entity33 , which had formed in 1955 when the two major coalitions of unions decided to merge , proved integral to lobbying for @entity132 's domestic proposals			2
@entity134 , the president of the @entity33 , and @entity136 , the vice president of the @entity33 and the head of the @entity138 , were regular visitors to the @entity117 , helping @entity132 not only with bills directly related to labor but with other parts of his domestic agenda , ranging from the @entity144 to civil rights			2
when he feared there were not enough votes among @entity3 for the war on poverty , @entity132 relied on organized labor to pressure business in @entity150 to push liberal @entity19 in the state to support the bill			1
even @entity153 , who in 1976 ran as an outsider and railed against traditional @entity18 interests , depended on unions to bring out the vote and on unionized workers to vote for him in key industrial states for his victory on election day			0
the relationship between labor and @entity3 frayed after the 1970s			1
one of the reasons was that organized labor simply lost much of its muscle			0
membership declined dramatically from the highs of 30 % of the work force in the 1950s and the 1960s to a little over 12 % today			0
with fewer members , more democrats were tempted to look elsewhere to build their electoral muscle			0
organized labor also suffered as @entity3 reached out more aggressively to different constituencies , middle class suburbanites , consumer activists , young @entity24 and african - americans , who did n't have as much connection to unions and often saw them as an " entrenched interest " that did n't have the best interest of the party in mind			1
these tensions started to play out in the 1972 election , when @entity134 endorsed @entity187 rather than @entity189 @entity188			0
some working - class @entity24 proved to be more conservative on cultural issues and often opposed to civil rights policies that @entity3 had promoted			2
and some union leaders felt that @entity3 were becoming too dovish on foreign policy			2
the tensions continued to affect the electorate through the 2008 primary , when @entity198 tried to appeal to working - class @entity3 who felt that @entity56 favored other factions in the party			1
finally , the expansion and strengthening of the lobbying world since the 1970s vastly increased the number of interest groups who favored business			0
these groups provided financial support to members of both parties and often made it difficult for @entity3 to take a pro-union stand			1
but @entity3 ca n't afford to lose the enthusiastic support of organized labor			1
of all the groups in the @entity18 coalition , labor remains the one with the greatest ground force and organizational strength -- and which represents a constituency rather than a particular issue ( like the environment ) -- that can help @entity3 sustain a broad coalition			1
during @entity56 's struggle with @entity228 over health care , labor was essential in the final days of the congressional vote to convincing unhappy liberals to support a bill even without a public option			1
in this election , labor will be integral in the handful of swing states that will determine the outcome			0
with heightened economic inequality and high rates of unemployment , unions have the ability to have even greater resonance with the electorate			0
@entity56 and the @entity18 will suffer unless the party starts to demonstrate that the concerns of working @entity24 are more than campaign rhetoric but are , in fact , a defining feature of their party			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			0

unions are *planning* rally august 11 to promote agenda before conventions
@entity254 : @entity29 believes neither party has acted with their best interest in mind
for decades , @entity3 have had a *standoffish* *attitude* to labor unions , he says
@entity254 : democrats must have labor 's support , with all of its organizational power
