-- when @entity2 won the @entity3 in 1998 , she could not have imagined the impact it would have on the golfing world			1
then 20 years old , and the only @entity8 on the @entity9 , @entity7 won a titanic 20 - hole playoff to claim her second major title in her rookie season			1
she had won the @entity13 earlier that year , but it was her success at @entity16 that triggered a phenomenal boom in female golfing talent in both her home country and @entity20 in general			2
four of the last five @entity3 champions have been from @entity8 , most recently @entity22 -- who on sunday clinched her first major title with a four - shot victory over compatriot @entity25 at the same course in @entity27 , @entity28 where @entity7 inspired so many dreams			1
" that was 14 years ago			0
i was only 10 years old and when i was watching tv , my goal was ... my dream was like i just want to be there , " @entity31 said on the @entity9 website			1
" and 14 years later i 'm here right now , and i made it			0
my dream 's come true			0
i really appreciate what @entity2 did and all the @entity8 players , what they did			1
it 's really no way i can be here without them			0
" i really wish like 14 years later from now some junior golfer or some young @entity8 golfer says , ' i was watching on tv how @entity22 was playing 14 years ago and that inspired me			1
" @entity49 aims to be ' the @entity50 of golf ' after historic @entity9 win @entity7 was there to congratulate @entity31 , having overcome shoulder problems to take her place in the starting field -- 29 of which were @entity8			1
the five - time major winner wrapped up a round of one - under 71 , which was good enough for a tie for ninth , as @entity31 was playing at the adjacent ninth hole			1
" i 'm trying to give her a little look back , but i do n't want her to lose her focus , so i 'm trying to not give her a look , " @entity7 said			2
" but you know , she 's already been there many times			0
she won five times ( on the @entity9 ) already , and of course , this is a little different than a regular event , but she 's good enough to be out there , she hung in there			0
" @entity31 needed to hold her nerve after a triple - bogey at the 10th cut her lead to two shots , and responded with an immediate birdie before a 20 - foot par - saving putt at 12 and some lucky bounces off rocks to avoid the water hazard at 13			2
" that moment ( the triple - bogey ) maybe i thought i might screw up today , but i thought i needed to fix that			0
i can do it , " @entity31 said			2
" so i tried to think what i have to do			0
so i started to talk with my caddie about just like what airplane tomorrow , or about the car or about the vacation			0
" from military kid to major champion : @entity98 's salute to @entity100 soldiers the top 10 featured just three @entity100 players , as 2010 winner @entity98 tied for seventh with @entity104 's @entity103 while 2007 champion @entity105 and @entity106 were alongside @entity7 on four over for the tournament			1
@entity109 's @entity108 claimed third ahead of @entity8 's @entity111 , @entity13 winner @entity49 of @entity112 and @entity114 's @entity113 in fourth equal			1
defending champion @entity115 of @entity8 was tied for 14th in a group including 17 - year - old @entity100 @entity117 , who was seeking to become the youngest winner of a major in either the men 's or women 's game			1
she had been tied for third after 54 holes , but closed with 78 -- a better closing round might have made her a winner 10 days younger than @entity126 when he triumphed at the @entity127 in 1868			0
former @entity100 teen prodigy @entity128 faded from 13th going into the final round to a tie for 35th after carding 80			0
