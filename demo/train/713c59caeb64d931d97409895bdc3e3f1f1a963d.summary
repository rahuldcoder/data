@entity3 , the only person convicted in connection with the @entity6 airline bombing that killed 270 people , died sunday , the @entity1 government and family members said			1
the former intelligence officer , who had suffered from prostate cancer , will be buried monday , according to a @entity1 foreign ministry spokesman			1
@entity13 's cousin , @entity12 , told @entity14 he was at a @entity16 hospital with @entity3 when he died			1
his death came more than two - and - a - half years after he was freed from a life sentence in @entity19 because he was said to be dying			1
his brother said the family refers " to the deceased as ' the convicted innocent			2
' " " may @entity24 bless his soul , " he added			0
relatives of those killed in the bombing expressed relief and , in some cases , anger			0
" he was a mass murderer			1
i feel no pity , " said @entity32 , whose daughter was among the 189 americans killed			2
@entity6 victims ' families : relief , anger the destruction of @entity6 over @entity6 , @entity19 , in 1988 was the deadliest act of air terrorism targeting @entity34 until the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , according to the @entity44			1
@entity34 and @entity46 investigators who painstakingly pieced together the wreckage concluded it was destroyed by a bomb			1
authorities in those nations claimed @entity3 -- once the security chief for @entity53 -- and @entity54 were @entity1 intelligence agents who planted the explosive			1
they were charged in november 1991 on 270 counts of murder and conspiracy to murder			1
that indictment set off the first battle over @entity3 , until @entity1 handed him and @entity62 over in the face of international pressure			1
eight years after his trial and conviction , a fresh uproar arose when he was released from a @entity19 prison because he was battling terminal prostate cancer			1
he received a hero 's welcome upon arriving home in @entity1			1
and last year , as rebel fighters advanced and , ultimately , toppled @entity74 and his regime , the debate was revived as some called for @entity3 's extradition back to @entity46 or to the @entity34			1
but even after new leaders took power , he remained in @entity1			2
@entity14 senior international correspondent @entity80 tracked @entity3 down last august at the palatial villa @entity74 had built for him			2
apparently in a coma and near death , @entity3 's family said then that his son and mother were trying to care for him with oxygen and an intravenous drip , but with no medical assistance			2
his death may make it impossible ever to get the full story behind the @entity6 bombing			2
in an interview with @entity95 last october , @entity3 vowed " new facts " would come to light			0
the truth will come out " one day , and hopefully in the near future , " he said			0
2011 : convicted @entity6 bomber says truth will eventually come out reacting to news of the convicted killer 's death , @entity46 prime minister @entity102 on sunday reiterated his belief that " he should never have been released from prison			1
" " today is a day to remember the 270 people who lost their lives in what was an appalling terrorist act , " @entity102 at the @entity110 summit in @entity111			0
" our thoughts should be with them and their families for the suffering they 've had			0
" @entity19 's first minister @entity120 -- the top @entity19 political figure -- likewise expressed sympathy for the attack 's victims , while asserting that @entity3 's death puts " to rest some of the conspiracy theories which have attempted to suggest that his illness was somehow manufactured			1
" despite widespread criticism , " extensive scrutiny " has found that @entity19 released @entity3 on " compassionate grounds alone , " @entity120 said in his statement			1
his release -- and the celebrations that greeted him in @entity1 -- sparked condemnation from the @entity34 and @entity46 governments , and from some victims ' families			1
@entity34 sen. @entity139 , a @entity141 @entity140 , accused " the @entity19 government , perhaps with the participation of the @entity46 government , ( of creating ) a major injustice when they let him out			1
" " this man was a horrible man , " @entity139 told @entity14 on sunday			0
" it would have been better had he not died in freedom , but died in prison			0
that 's what he deserved			0
" " the only legacy we have is in the memory of all those who were lost , " @entity139 added			0
" ... we have to just make sure we continue this battle against terrorism on airplanes			0
we made great progress and we have to keep it up			0
" when @entity162 and @entity163 blamed @entity3 and @entity54 for the attack , @entity1 refused to hand them over			2
that led the @entity167 in april 1992 to slap sanctions on the north @entity170 nation , clamping down on arms sales and air travel			0
the @entity44 put the two men on its @entity175 -- the only time officers of a foreign government have ever been so named , spokesman @entity173 said			0
two years later , @entity1 floated the idea of trying the men in an international court , which the @entity34 and @entity46 rejected			1
@entity1 made a new proposal in summer 1998 : that the men go on trial in the @entity183 , albeit under @entity19 law			1
by the end of that year , matters came to a head when then @entity189 secretary - general @entity188 met @entity74 in @entity16			0
ten days later , a @entity34 @entity190 ruled that families of @entity34 killed in the bombing could sue @entity1 for possibly sponsoring the attack			2
the next day , @entity1 agreed to let the men face trial			2
they were handed over april 5 , 1999 , to the @entity189 , which suspended its sanctions the same day			0
two months later , @entity34 and @entity1 officials met face - to - face for the first time in 18 years			2
@entity1 later agreed in 2003 to pay $ 2.7 billion to victims ' families , though @entity74 was always cagey about admitting official @entity1 involvement			1
after a nine - month trial , @entity3 was convicted in 2001 of the murders after prosecutors dropped lesser charges			0
he was sentenced to life in prison , having to serve a minimum of 27 years			0
@entity19 does not allow the death penalty			2
@entity54 was found not guilty			0
for his part , @entity3 continued to fight to clear his name			0
in june 2007 , the @entity213 allowed one appeal to go forward , ruling it uncovered new evidence and that @entity3 " may have suffered a miscarriage of justice			0
" before that appeal was heard , however , it emerged @entity3 had terminal prostate cancer			0
@entity19 justice secretary @entity220 , who had authority over the case because the convicted bomber was jailed in @entity19 , ordered him freed in august 2009			1
some family members of @entity6 victims swiftly complained that , with the legal process ending after @entity3 dropped his appeal , they 'd never know the full truth			2
@entity46 press , meanwhile , alleged the release was tied to oil deals with @entity1			1
@entity46 and @entity19 officials denied that claim , making public more than 100 pages of previously secret documents to make their case			1
the papers included a handwritten letter from @entity3 to @entity220 , pleading that he be allowed to see his family before he died , and continuing to proclaim his innocence			0
the documents also showed that senior @entity1 officials warned their @entity19 and @entity46 counterparts it would be " catastrophic " for @entity46 - @entity1 relations if @entity3 died in prison			1
@entity74 's son , @entity246 , @entity74 's son and heir apparent who accompanied @entity3 back to @entity1 on august 20 , 2009 , said @entity1 was " very angry " at @entity46 efforts to keep @entity3 out of a separate prisoner transfer agreement			1
but he said , ultimately , the bomber was released for a different reason			0
it was " not because of business deals , " @entity246 told @entity14 in early september , two months before he himself was captured in @entity1			2
" the guy is sick , seriously sick			0
he has cancer , and , because of that , they made their decision			0

a @entity6 victim 's mother says she has " no pity " for a " mass murderer "
@entity13 was convicted of murder after 270 died when @entity6 blew up over @entity19
he was released in august 2009 on " compassionate grounds " and welcomed warmly in @entity1
a @entity19 official defends the release , which @entity46 's current leader and others still criticize
