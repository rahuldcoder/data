@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 court on thursday postponed a decision on whether to grant bail to a @entity7 girl accused of burning pages of the @entity9 in a case that has heightened religious tensions in the capital , @entity0			1
the @entity1 authorities have come under pressure to guarantee the safety of the girl , identified as @entity17 , in a country where people accused of blasphemy have been killed by members of the public in the past			1
@entity24 , one of @entity17 's lawyers , has sought bail for her , saying she is legally a minor and should be reunited with her parents rather than kept in a jail where adults are also being held			1
to back up his argument , @entity24 cited a report on tuesday by an independent medical board stating that @entity17 was 14			1
the doctors who examined her also concluded that her mental age was lower than her chronological age			0
but on thursday , the lawyer for the man accusing @entity17 queried the legal validity of the board 's report			1
the lawyer , @entity44 , said the seven - doctor board was constituted by the local authorities , not by court order			2
as a result , the court adjourned until saturday to allow time to verify the medical report			1
@entity44 said he was representing the accuser free of charge because he believes @entity54 will reward him for his work			0
the police have said that @entity17 is illiterate and has not attended school			0
they said last week that she had told them that she had no idea that there were pages of the @entity9 inside the documents she alleged to have burned			1
the court faces a difficult decision amid concerns that if @entity17 is released on bail , she could be at risk from @entity70 angered by the allegations against her			2
@entity24 , who is also a leading member of the @entity7 community and member of the @entity75 , said @entity17 is too young to stay in prison and would be safer joining her family , who are now in hiding			1
" she was crying in the jail and missing her parents , " he said			0
@entity24 says he expects @entity17 's trial to last as long as two years			2
she would remain in custody for its duration , if bail is denied , he said			0
if she is tried as a minor , she might also receive a milder sentence if convicted			0
as an adult , she faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for willful desecration of the @entity9 , @entity24 said @entity17 was accused by a local resident of burning pages of the @entity94 holy text after she gathered paper as fuel for cooking in @entity0 , according to the authorities			1
the man said he found her carrying ashes that included burned pages of the @entity9 in a small bag			1
@entity24 has said that nobody actually saw @entity17 burning the papers			0
the case has already had a severe effect on people in the area			0
hundreds of @entity7 families have had to leave the area for fear of violence , @entity24 said			2
the police said last week that about 150 people had gathered on august 17 -- the day @entity17 was arrested -- in the area where the neighborhood 's @entity7 population lives and threatened to burn down their houses			1
in a statement last week , president @entity117 said he had called for an urgent report on the incident and added that vulnerable sections of society must be protected " from any misuse of the blasphemy law			0
" " blasphemy by anyone can not be condoned but no one will be allowed to misuse blasphemy law for settling personal scores , " said the president 's spokesman , @entity125			0
critics of the controversial law say it is being used to persecute religious minorities			0
" if any muslim is accused for blasphemy , people do n't burn houses , " @entity24 said			0
" but if the accused is a non-muslim , mob burns our entire villages			0
" @entity1 is home to about 2 million @entity7 , who make up more than 1 % of the @entity94 nation 's population , according to government statistics			1
@entity17 's case " illustrates the erosion of the rule of law and the dangers faced by those accused of blasphemy in @entity1 , " the human rights advocacy group @entity146 said in a statement last week			2
@entity2 's @entity154 in @entity155 ; and journalists @entity156 in @entity0 and @entity158 in @entity159 contributed to this report .			2
