-- @entity2 's parliament has voted to secede from @entity3 and join @entity4 , and has scheduled a referendum for its residents to decide whether to stay or go			1
it is one of the biggest developments in the fast - moving crisis in @entity3			0
who is voting ? the voters deciding @entity2 's future would be the residents of that region			1
@entity2 has a population of about 2 million			1
@entity2 is known as a @entity18 area , but it is not without its diversity			1
the autonomous region has a 60 % ethnic @entity4 population , having been part of @entity4 until it was ceded to @entity3 in 1954 by the @entity24			1
but not everyone may be as keen on coming under @entity27 's direct influence			0
a quarter of the peninsula 's population is @entity3 and about 12 % @entity31 , a predominantly @entity33 group			2
the @entity34 have shown no interest in breaking away			0
how much credibility will the vote have ? the legality of the referendum has been challenged from the outset			0
while the @entity2 parliament voted to hold the referendum , at the federal level , @entity3 leaders say a referendum is illegal			1
it 's an " illegitimate decision , " interim @entity3 prime minister @entity46 said thursday			2
" @entity2 was , is , and will be an integral part of @entity3			2
" justice minister @entity49 said the @entity2 parliament 's decision is illegal because under the constitution , only national referendums are permitted			1
the @entity54 has sent a military observer mission to @entity3 , but it can only expand its mission to monitor the vote if the @entity3 government invites it to			0
in @entity2 , worlds collide what 's next if the referendum passes ? see above			1
even if the vote goes as planned , its legitimacy will continue to be questioned			0
@entity65 , a former @entity66 ambassador in @entity67 , cautioned that whatever the result of the vote , it may be meaningless			0
" it does not follow that if @entity2 votes to join @entity4 , that anyone will accept it , " he said			1
" for @entity4 to start cherry - picking bits of the @entity75 , cranking up referenda in @entity77 or @entity78 or wherever you like , to try to carve off bits , would be against international law , and it would be something ( that @entity4 president ) @entity84 has said he does n't want to do			2
" in short , it is not clear how easily @entity2 could secede from @entity3 and join @entity4			1
who would benefit from @entity2 's secession ? it is not clear			1
at first glance , it may appear that many @entity31 would get what they want and @entity4 would gain a territory , but the benefits are not so clear - cut			2
" while separatism may seem emotionally gratifying to some ( @entity2 ) residents , the practical results seen elsewhere , especially in @entity97 and @entity98 , have been economic isolation and a heightened dependence on @entity4 , " @entity94 , an expert on the region , wrote recently			1
@entity97 and @entity98 are two separatist regions of @entity104 that @entity4 occupied in 2008			2
for @entity4 , peeling off a slice of territory from @entity3 is n't productive , @entity94 wrote			0
its goal is to get all of @entity3 under its influence			0
taking steps toward separatism has only deepened the crisis , as @entity4 intervention has galvanized anti-russian sentiment in other parts of @entity3			0
the referendum , scheduled for march 16 , will probably just add fuel to the fire			0
five possible directions in @entity3			0

@entity2 is 60 % @entity4
the @entity2 referendum may be illegitimate , experts say
it 's *unclear* what will happen if the referendum passes
