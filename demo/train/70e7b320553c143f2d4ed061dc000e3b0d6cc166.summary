-- @entity1 spent two years researching her dream trip to @entity3			2
but she was n't looking for the perfect safari lodge			2
she was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon			1
when she told her family , it was n't an easy sell			2
" @entity3 ? you 're going to get some kind of witch doctor , " she recalls her father saying			2
" but i told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there			2
to me , @entity3 had the most reputable surgeons			2
" @entity1 , of @entity18 , @entity19 , traveled to @entity20 in 2004 for a face - lift , upper arm lift and eyelid surgery			2
and she and her husband -- who had n't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari , included in the package by medical - travel agency @entity28 and @entity29			2
" medical tourism " may sound strange , but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the @entity33 price			1
and many surgeries include sightseeing packages			2
the roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing			2
@entity3 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 have become major players			0
@entity50 , a travel writer from @entity51 , @entity52 , journeyed last year to @entity43 for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons : " if i 'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time , twice , @entity55 has got to be the best possible place , " he says @entity50 's procedures were organized by @entity59 , a medical - travel facilitator in @entity55 , which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back			1
he was n't the only guest getting surgery : " while i was there , there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type			0
" cost - cutting pros and cons cosmetic , or elective , procedures are n't covered by insurance , so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists			1
surgeries in many countries cost half or even one - fifth what they would in the @entity33 -- including airfare , hotel and excursions			1
" a full face - lift that would cost $ 20,000 in the @entity33 runs about $ 1,250 in @entity3 , " a 2005 article in @entity89 , the @entity86 's online news service noted			1
@entity90 , of @entity91 , @entity92 , got a face - lift in @entity94 , @entity44			0
her trip was organized by @entity97 's @entity96			0
" in the @entity33 , it would have cost $ 20,000 for the procedure alone , with no time in the hospital , " she says			1
in @entity94 , @entity90 was in the hospital four days , and the total cost of her 19 - day trip , including sightseeing and airfare for two , was $ 10,600			0
@entity50 estimates he saved $ 18,000 on his surgeries			0
" cost was the primary factor , " he says			0
" medical costs abroad are less than in the @entity33 for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates , lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits , which means lower malpractice - insurance costs			1
but the @entity115 warns against low - cost surgery			0
" get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent , not on your face , " says spokesman @entity117			0
" researching the quality of doctors should be a patient 's primary consideration , but it is n't always , " he says			1
" some people think ' tummy tuck and shopping			1
' this is not makeup ; it 's somebody cutting you			0
" some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions			0
more casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch - break @entity143 treatments and same - day liposuctions , paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes			0
even stateside , cosmetic surgery can have tragic results			1
" @entity153 " author @entity152 died during a chin - tuck in 2004 , and this year @entity156 's mother , @entity155 , died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction			1
however , a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the @entity161 , found that " deaths occurring at office - based surgery facilities ( in the @entity33 ) are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent			1
" quality surgeons medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices do n't necessarily mean lower quality of care			1
" in general , it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to ' world - class ' status or to meeting or exceeding @entity33 standards that are competing for patients from the @entity33 and other countries , " says @entity171 , author of " @entity172 : a medical tourist 's guide to @entity182 and @entity183 outside the @entity33 " the authors of a 2006 " @entity185 " article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals : " we doubt (...) that the average @entity33 hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations			1
" " almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the @entity33 or @entity195 , " says @entity192 , vice president of sales and marketing for @entity96			1
" it gives the @entity33 consumer a degree of confidence			1
" @entity90 , a registered nurse , agrees that standards are high abroad			0
" after the surgery , the nurses were there for me 100 percent , " she says			1
" at home , we 're so understaffed and overburdened , and inundated with paperwork			0
" when @entity50 visited @entity33 dentists , " i felt like i was being processed for a home loan , " he says			1
" in @entity43 , i had three dentists working on me at once			0
" while medical tourism continues to increase in popularity , it 's still not mainstream			1
when @entity90 left for @entity94 , she " did n't tell a soul , not even my seven children , who are almost all in the medical field			0
they would have had a stroke			0
" at @entity220 , though , they were all saying , ' you really do look good			0
' " e-mail to a friend @entity0 provides original and syndicated content to web publishers			0
