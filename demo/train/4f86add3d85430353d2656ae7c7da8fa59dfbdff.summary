-- june 1 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : the start of a new month , the start of a new day of @entity0 ! hi , i 'm @entity17 , and i 'm delivering your 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines			2
first up : home prices drop @entity20 : first up , we 're talking about a new low for the price of homes in the @entity25			1
during the first quarter -- the first three months -- of 2011 , home prices dropped more than 5 percent from where they were last year			1
now , that 's according to a new report that came out yesterday			1
and the comparison gets even worse when you go back a little farther			2
the housing market hit its highest point five years ago in 2006			2
compared to that -- that highest point -- prices of homes have dropped almost 33 percent			1
home prices are down ; so what ? it might not be something that you think about every day , but some of your parents are paying close attention			1
home prices affect a lot of other industries -- like banks , like construction -- so that 's one of the big indicators that experts use to figure out how the @entity25 economy is doing			1
and prices have gone through kind of a double - dip			1
they went down after that peak in 2006			2
then they went back up a little bit around 2009			2
some government programs designed to encourage people to buy houses helped with that increase			2
but now , they 're dropping again			2
and one expert says it does n't look like that 's going to change any time soon			1
@entity70 @entity20 : officials in @entity4 are warning people there not to eat raw cucumbers , leaf lettuce , or tomatoes			2
the reason : an outbreak of @entity70			2
that 's a bacteria that can be transmitted through contaminated food or water , especially raw vegetables			1
reports have connected at least 16 deaths to the outbreak			2
hundreds of other people have gotten sick			2
@entity4 authorities are trying to contain the outbreak			2
in the meantime , scientists are trying to figure out where it started			2
they do n't have that answer yet			2
they think it could be traced back to produce from @entity94			2
@entity4 buys more @entity94 fruits and vegetables than any other country			2
and the concerns about those foods could cost @entity94 's food industry millions of dollars			1
@entity101 @entity102 , @entity14 : time for the shoutout ! what 's the term for when energy travels in particles or waves ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity115 , b ) sublimation , c ) radiation or @entity119 ) circumnavigation ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! when energy is transmitted in particles or waves , it 's called radiation			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity128 & @entity129 @entity20 : the @entity130 says that radiation from cell phones could possibly cause cancer			1
that announcement came after a group of scientists analyzed studies that have been done on cell phone safety			1
what this means is that the scientists found some evidence of an increase in certain types of cancer for cell phone users			1
they were n't able to make any conclusions about other types of cancers			2
one expert says it 's hard because it can take several decades of exposure to see if there are any consequences			1
the wireless industry said the announcement does not mean cell phones cause cancer			1
it pointed out that the scientists did n't do new research , but just reviewed studies that already existed			2
this announcement probably will lead to more research on the issue			2
@entity167 @entity20 : recovery efforts are getting started in @entity5 , @entity6 , and help is coming from some unexpected places			0
for example , a group of homeless volunteers from @entity174			0
they collected donations for the tornado victims and then drove to @entity5 to distribute them			0
another unique source of help : an elephant from a circus that was supposed to perform in the area			0
the show , of course , could n't happen			0
but the animal was able to use its strength to help workers clear heavy debris from some areas			0
many residents of @entity5 are still coming to grips with the devastation that hit their hometown			0
@entity195 of affiliate @entity196 reports on the tornado 's impact on the @entity200 community			1
( begin video ) @entity202 , @entity203 : @entity204 graduated from @entity200 just an hour before the tornado hit			0
@entity206 , @entity207 : even looking at it , it 's still really hard to believe it			1
@entity211 : now , she 's singing the national anthem at a memorial service for her classmates and the community			1
@entity217 : it 's so hard singing it right in front of my school that just blew away			1
@entity211 : but @entity200 sophomore @entity223 still has the rest of her high school career ahead of her , as she looks at what is left in shambles			0
@entity228 , @entity229 : it 's indescribable			1
it 's horrible , just devastating to see all the destruction of my school , my home			1
@entity211 : @entity223 is one of many students who lost both			1
@entity228 : it was heartbreaking			0
my whole neighborhood is gone , but everyone 's ok			1
@entity211 : it was a somber afternoon as they gathered outside the school			0
a moment of silence honoring military and tornado victims			0
eight people in the @entity245 are confirmed dead : seven students and one staff member			1
@entity217 : wondering who is still alive and who 's not			1
@entity211 : superintendent dr. @entity250 said last friday , when he got word , his world stopped			0
sorrow for the lost and relief for the living			0
@entity255 , superintendent , joplin @entity256 : as a result of your diligence and unwavering fortitude in the face of insurmountable challenges , 100 percent of our family are accounted for			0
@entity211 : summer classes will begin as scheduled in less than three weeks , on june 13th			0
( @entity267 ) @entity268 @entity269 , @entity14 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm a famous landmark visited by millions every year			0
i 'm located in @entity273			0
i was formed by the @entity274			0
i 'm the @entity275 , a huge rock formation that 's a mile deep			1
all work , no play @entity20 : the @entity275 's a major vacation destination			1
the nearly 5 million people who go there every year prove that			0
but would the @entity275 get even more visitors if @entity25 workers took as much vacation as employees in other countries ? that 's what we 're talking about			1
when it comes to time off , the @entity25 is not number one			1
@entity292 looks at some of the reasons why			1
( begin video ) @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 : days at the beach , trips you 'll remember for a lifetime			0
that 's what summer is all about , right ? not for most @entity25 workers , who lag behind international counterparts in the vacation time given and the time taken			1
according to a survey by @entity312 , workers in @entity310 got an average of 28 days ' vacation last year			0
here in the @entity25 : 18			1
and they only used 14			0
so , what 's holding @entity25 back ? with the economy still recovering , some workers are just happy to have a job to go to every day			1
and with staffing pared to bare bones during the recession , they 'd rather be at their desks than on a guilt trip			0
@entity326 , clinical psychologist : we feel that we 're letting our colleagues down			0
we 're afraid of the work that 's waiting for us when we get back from vacation			1
and that guilt will make us not take the days off that we really need			0
@entity333 : there are also the lingering financial concerns			0
a recent survey from @entity337 found one in four workers simply ca n't afford a getaway this year			0
twelve percent say they can afford it but wo n't go			0
and only one in three said they felt more comfortable taking a vacation this summer than they did last year			0
( @entity267 ) driving knowledge @entity20 : sticking with the idea of hitting the road , it turns out about 37 million @entity25 drivers should n't ! according to a new survey , one out of every five people in the @entity25 would fail a driving test if they had to take one today			1
and what 's even more strange : that 's an improvement ! last year , 38 million people -- one million more -- would have failed			1
this survey asked drivers from all 50 states 20 questions about basic driving knowledge			0
what do you do when you 're approaching a yellow light ? what 's a safe following distance ? things like that			1
the concern is that not knowing the rules leads to dangerous driving habits			0
@entity371 e-mail @entity20 : teachers , we know a lot of you get our daily e-mail			0
as you get ready to head off for the summer , you do n't need to unsubscribe			0
the email is not gon na come out every day			0
we 'll only send you something when we have something to say , like when one of our special summer shows goes up at @entity383			0
so stay subscribed ; we will not spam you , we promise ! before we go @entity20 : before we go , we 're checking out a barnyard brawl			0
boom ! only problem is , this is n't the barnyard			0
it 's somebody 's back yard ! a flock of sheep showed up in a @entity392 neighborhood , and they did n't want to go anywhere			1
police surrounded the feisty flock and eventually had to call in animal control			0
it 's not like you could ask the sheep to leave nicely			1
i mean , you might try , but you know they would n't go for it			0
goodbye @entity20 : those guys just look like they have baaaaad attitudes			0
or maybe they were hoping not to get noticed so they could pull the wool over everyone 's eyes			1
that would have been shear genius			0
it 's always fun to see sheep on the lamb			1
but now that the whole thing 's over , i bet they felt sheepish about causing such a problem			2
they are known to have bleat - ing hearts			0
you can tell the year 's winding up , because we 're getting awfully punchy			2
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity17 .			0
