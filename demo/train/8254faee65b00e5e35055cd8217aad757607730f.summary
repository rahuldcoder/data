@entity0 -- attention , campers			0
national parks are becoming " no drone " zones			1
the @entity7 announced friday it is prohibiting drones -- properly called unmanned aircraft -- from all @entity7 - controlled lands and waters			1
that includes 84 million acres in every state and territory , including monuments , battlefields , historic sites , seashores , rivers and trails			0
it all comes down to noise and safety , said director @entity24 in a statement announcing the policy			1
" we have serious concerns about the negative impact that flying unmanned aircraft is having in parks , so we are prohibiting their use until we can determine the most appropriate policy , " @entity24 said			1
the @entity34 already has greatly curtailed the outdoor use of drones for commercial purposes , pending rules that it is developing			2
but hobbyists have been relatively free to operate drones in public areas , provided they stay below 400 feet and are flown away from populated areas and full - scale aircraft			2
college lends drones to students a lawyer who represents drone enthusiasts called the @entity7 ' temporary ban " overly broad " and said he expects it will be greatly narrowed when it goes through the federal rule - making process			1
" it 's very broad in that it sweeps in every national park - controlled location , including things like beaches and forests where there really are n't the same sensitivities to noise , and where model airplanes have been allowed for decades , " said @entity52			1
the @entity7 said individual parks have been enacting drone bans for a number of reasons			1
last september , an unmanned aircraft flew above visitors seated in the @entity72 amphitheater			0
park rangers confiscated the drone because of concern for visitor safety , the @entity7 said			1
in april , a loud drone interrupted visitors enjoying a quiet @entity79 sunset			0
and volunteers at @entity81 in @entity82 witnessed a drone disturb a herd of bighorn sheep			0
all previously issued permits for drones will be suspended until reviewed by a senior @entity7 official , who also must approve any new special use permits			2
superintendents who have previously authorized the use of model aircraft for hobbyist or recreational use may allow such use to continue , the statement said			0
@entity52 said friday 's action by the @entity7 also calls into question the validity of that fine , saying that the agency has stated it needs the new regulation because earlier regulations do not cover unmanned aircraft			2
in a separate case , @entity104 earlier this year successfully challenged an @entity34 prohibition on commercial use of drones after the @entity34 fined him $ 10,000 for using a small drone to take promotional videos of the @entity111			0
the @entity34 has appealed that decision			0
@entity114 university library to lend drones to students			0
