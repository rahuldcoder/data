-- not in my lifetime have i witnessed a pope who has so quickly succeeded in making more @entity4 , and non-catholics , hyperventilate than @entity6			1
indeed , some are ready to jump off the bleachers			0
they all need to calm down			0
pope @entity6 is delightfully frank , and that is what makes him positively engaging			1
he is also provocative in the best sense of that word			0
he seeks to challenge us and shake us out of our comfort zone			1
but he is not about to turn the @entity4 upside down and inside out			1
such talk is pure lunacy			0
in a three - part meeting in @entity18 with @entity4 journalists last month , @entity6 offered his thoughts on a wide range of subjects ; they were published thursday by @entity23 , the @entity24 weekly			1
everyone should read it for themselves			0
there is nothing new about ripping what a famous person said out of context , and that is exactly what is going on now with @entity6			1
the breaking news alert by @entity36 is titled , " @entity37			0
" in the @entity36 alert , it says the pope discusses how " the @entity4 has grown ' obsessed ' with preaching about abortion , gay marriage and contraception , " and that he has been criticized for doing so			1
it also quotes him saying the @entity4 should be " home for all " and not a " small chapel " that is " focused on doctrine , orthodoxy and a limited agenda of moral teachings			1
" regarding the pope 's statements on abortion and gay marriage , here is what he said : " we can not insist only on issues related to abortion , gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods			1
" he also said , " when we speak about these issues , we have to talk about them in a context			0
" what the pope said makes eminently good sense			2
for example , when i became president of the @entity71 20 years ago , i visited the chapters around the nation and found that many were single - issue entities			1
some focused exclusively on abortion ; others were obsessed with homosexuality ; still others demanded we just concentrate on medical ethics			2
i shared many of their concerns , but i also told them we are an anti-defamation organization and should not become preoccupied with other matters , no matter how noble			2
the pope is right that single - issue @entity4 need to rise above their immediate concerns			1
he did not say we should avoid addressing abortion or homosexuality ; he simply said we can not be absorbed by these issues			2
@entity94 's article in the @entity36 on the pope 's comments says @entity98 bishops will feel the pinch of these remarks as they often appear " to make combating abortion , gay marriage and contraception their top public policy priorities			1
it is not the bishops who have made these issues front and center -- it is the @entity111 administration			0
it would be more accurate to say the pope would find fault with the bishops if they did not resist these state encroachments on the religious liberty rights of @entity4			1
the @entity36 alert was wrong to characterize the pope 's " small chapel " remark as a criticism of focusing on " doctrine , orthodoxy and a limited agenda of moral teachings			2
" in the previous paragraph , he speaks about " the sanctity of the militant church			0
" in the following sentence , the pope says , " [ @entity131 ] e must not reduce the bosom of the universal church to a nest protecting our mediocrity			0
then , in the same paragraph , he cites the " negative behavior " of priests and nuns , saying their conduct is that of an " unfruitful bachelor " and a " spinster			0
" he most emphatically did not say what the @entity36 attributed to him			0
pope @entity6 unequivocally rejects abortion and gay marriage			1
elsewhere , he has said , " [ @entity151 ] he moral problem with abortion is of a prereligious nature because the genetic code of the person is present at the moment of conception			0
there is already a human being			0
" similarly , he says , his opposition to gay marriage " is not based on religion , but rather on anthropology			0
" pope @entity6 wants us to oppose abortion			1
he also wants us to reach out to women who are contemplating one , and to help women who have had one to find peace with @entity171 ( that 's why the @entity4 has @entity173 )			2
he wants us to oppose same - sex marriage			1
he also does n't want us to reject lesbians and gays because they are homosexual			0
this is sound @entity4 teaching			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity181 : pope @entity6 seeks to provoke and shake us out of our comfort zone
@entity181 : but he is not about to turn the @entity4 upside down , inside out
he says pope @entity6 unequivocally rejects both abortion and same - sex marriage
@entity181 : @entity6 is right that single - issue @entity4 need to rise above their concerns
