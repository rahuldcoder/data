-- @entity1 is one of the fashion industry 's biggest events of the year , the culmination of months of planning , organizing , schmoozing ... and dieting ? when it comes to the biannual fashion shows , which kick off thursday , models are n't the only ones looking to drop a few pounds before hitting the tents			1
some publicists , bloggers and fashion editors have been counting calories for weeks in anticipation of the week - long event , where to some , networking and being seen are just as important as the collections debuting on the runways			1
anyone who has tried to get in shape for a wedding or school reunion can relate to the pressure of wanting to look his or her best and reaching to achieve that goal with varying degrees of success			2
consumers turn out for @entity33 's @entity32 nutritionists say that limiting caloric intake in a compressed time frame can lead to nutrient deficiencies , causing decreased immune function , dry skin and loss of muscle or bone density , for starters			2
but in an industry that 's all about image , it 's a price many are willing to pay			1
" perception is reality in this industry , and unfortunately , you have to look the look to get the clients , " said public relations specialist @entity48 , who began her @entity1 diet in july			1
she plans on attending @entity1 to recruit designers for her firm , @entity58			1
throughout the summer , fashionistas from all corners of the industry have been tweeting with a blend of sarcasm and sincerity about plans to start , defer or defy a # nyfw diet			1
" i 'm thinking we should start our # nyfw diet tomorrow			1
what do you think ? " tweeted @entity69 pr girl , the online persona of fashion publicist extraordinaire @entity74 , senior vice president of global communications at @entity69 , on august 12			1
she followed up with " @entity76 " regulations : " no non-purpose bread ( ie bread baskets , pretzels , croutons ) or candy / sugar			0
@entity84 : frozen yogurt is ok			0
" the tweet prompted conversation over froyo toppings ( " just sprinkles			0
no middle / bottom " ) and how cutting out bread makes a huge difference ( " soon you 'll realize your body hates it " )			0
tweets about the # nyfw diet continued this week , though some accompanied by images of cupcakes and quesadillas were clearly intended to be tongue - in - cheek			1
but others made it clear they were still counting calories like it 's their job			0
" @entity1 is prime recruiting season , and we all are walking billboards			1
you have to be on your a-game and look your best , " @entity48 said			0
" you want to go to events wearing the designers ' clothes , and you ca n't do that with a flabby belly			0
" @entity48 posted a picture of her # nyfw diet dinner on august 16 : a bowl of broccoli			1
while tales abound of models going on crash diets and @entity123 and publicists surviving on coffee , cigarettes and air kisses , for many like @entity48 , it 's a balancing act of limiting calorie intake while meeting basic nutritional needs			0
@entity48 began her @entity1 diet on july 4			1
a typical day starts with a protein shake and lemon water for breakfast , followed by a side salad for lunch			0
for dinner , she prepares a piece of protein , like unseasoned chicken oven - baked without oil , accompanied by a serving of steamed veggies such as broccoli , squash or asparagus			1
if she gets hungry , she snacks on fruit slices or downs water and takes a daily multivitamin with extra iron			0
she has n't cut out alcohol entirely			0
but she has switched from dessert white wines , her drink of choice , to reds , setting a limit of one per outing			0
looks debuting at @entity1 no , it has n't been easy , she said			1
but it 's part of the job , and she loves what she does			0
" it 's hard , but i know what the end result will be , " she said			0
" no pain , no gain			0
" nutrition specialist dr. @entity168 said @entity48 's regimen is n't as bad as the horror stories of people chain - smoking to stave off hunger or eking out a meager existence on cayenne - pepper - flavored water			2
but it 's still a little low in calories and fat for optimal health , she said , and could lead to a loss of muscle mass , which is difficult to rebuild			0
the process creates a vicious cycle in which each time a person goes on a diet like @entity48 's , she 'll have to further lower her caloric intake in order to drop weight			2
meanwhile , the loss of nutrients could lead to long - term deficiencies and wreak havoc on the body 's ability to metabolize , @entity168 said			2
" with low - fat diets , we see a lot of skinny fat , where they get lean , but their body fat goes up because they 're losing muscle , " @entity168 said			2
@entity1 desserts " i would n't call this a crash diet			1
it 's too low in calories , and she 's certainly missing out on fat , but if she added protein at lunch and healthy snacks like nuts , seeds and avocados , i think she 'd look and feel great			0
" as @entity1 kicks off , @entity48 said , other priorities are consuming her attention , like piecing together outfits that will help her get into shows she has n't been invited to			1
she believes she is one step closer to the runways , thanks to her # nyfw diet			2
after all , she has dropped from 152 to 141 pounds in just two months			2
" this process is very grueling , but being able to be at @entity1 is every woman 's dream , " she said			1
" every woman should get to experience it once , even if you do n't go through what we have to go through			0
" @entity230 : behind - the - @entity231 from the shows			2
