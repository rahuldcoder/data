the two - time world champion slipped from fifth position on the grid to a seventh place finish at the @entity14 and the @entity15 is now 42 points behind current leader @entity17 in the drivers ' championship after three races			2
@entity1 , 29 , admitted he made a bad start in the year 's third grand prix but maintained race strategy was not the reason behind @entity2 's low - scoring performance			1

@entity32 ends @entity17 's winning run " i made a bad start , @entity35 [ @entity1 's teammate ] managed to get past me and a @entity36 nearly did the same , then it was a good battle on the opening lap. after the first pit stop , i lost too much time behind @entity41 [ @entity42 ] , thus losing touch with the leading group			1
" it was a good battle , but i would have preferred to have been doing it for a podium finish rather than seventh place			0
" @entity1 insisted @entity2 can improve and once again challenge @entity17 's front - running @entity50 team , citing the @entity27 and @entity52 teams as examples to follow			1
" i wo n't get downhearted or lose confidence			0
we know we have to improve to get to the front			0
@entity27 and @entity52 have managed it and there is no reason to think we ca n't do the same			0

" this can not and must not be the team 's level , " the 63 - year - old said			0
" it 's a very delicate moment			0
i expect our engineers to act with determination and know - how , unleashing the maximum of their capacity to improve the performance of the car in a short time			0
" i want @entity2 to be at the level that both we and our fans demand it should be			2
" the @entity88 @entity35 faired marginally better than his colleague with a sixth place finish , but the 29 - year - old disagreed with @entity1 that race strategy played no part in the result			1
" the strategy ? now , it 's easy to say that we were not on the right one , but we are a team and we take our decisions together			2
