@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a world where so much goes to waste without a moment 's thought , @entity1 artist @entity3 has made a livelihood out of upcycling rejected cutlery and transforming it into striking and inimitable jewelry			1
out of old and unwanted knives , forks and spoons , @entity3 crafts artistic and unique rings , bracelets , necklaces , as well as other household items			1
from his @entity0 home he trades under the name " @entity21 , " derived from @entity20 , meaning " @entity22 " " everywhere you go you will find that there 's something that people throw away and they do n't know it can be used , " he says			1
@entity3 gets the old tableware sent to him in bulk from sources abroad , particularly his brother , a fellow artist			1
friends or contacts entering @entity1 bring the cutlery into the country , and @entity36 pays the duty tax at the airport			1

he then proceeds to clean them and take them to his workshop within the @entity49 slum where he solders them , before returning to his apartment to craft the pieces			2
once he is done forming the pieces , he then has to tumble them and polish them in order to give them a clean finish and fresh appearance			0

it is in this pleasantly jumbled cavern , which serves as both his office and shop , that @entity36 sells his jewelry			1
each piece is exclusive because of the original distinctive design of the cutlery he uses			2
" i think it 's fun when you come here and then you see other things , because in the market , there you ca n't put everything , " he says			0

among his customers is @entity126 , a postgraduate student at the @entity127 , who says : " i love the rings			2
they 're very original and one of a kind			0

i buy them because i think they 're different ... not the kind of thing you 'd come across everyday " @entity144 , a student at @entity0 's @entity145 , says : " there 's definitely something personal about the whole process			1
