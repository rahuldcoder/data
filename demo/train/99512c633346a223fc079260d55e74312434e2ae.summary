-- @entity1 is holding an @entity3 - related press event next week and already the @entity4 is in a tizzy			1
could this be the rumored , mythical , magical @entity1 phone ? the truth is , i do n't know			1
for nearly 18 months , rumors of a @entity1 phone — developed by @entity11 and running a customized version of @entity3 — have continued to persist			1
and for nearly 18 months , @entity1 has publicly denied its interest in building its own phone			2
last september at @entity15 , @entity1 co-founder and ceo @entity17 went on at length about why a @entity1 phone was n't right for the company			1
he said : " let 's say we build a phone			0
we 're not , but if we did , we could maybe get 10 to 20 million people to use it ... it does n't move the needle for us			0
" " the strategy we have is different from every other tech company [ like @entity31 ] that 's building their own hardware system — we 're going in the opposite direction			0
. " of course , if a @entity1 phone is coming , this would n't be the first time that a ceo has said one thing publicly while planning on doing exactly the opposite			1
at @entity31 , @entity39 was famous for denouncing a product ( @entity42 video ) or industry ( mobile phones ) , only to enter that same industry or create that same product later			0
so let 's assume that a @entity1 phone is coming and that it will run some sort of highly - customized version of @entity3			1
does a @entity1 phone even make sense anymore , especially given the current market realities and competition in the mobile space ? i say no. the timing for a phone is no longer right when the rumors of a @entity1 phone first started to spread , the idea made sense — at least from a business perspective			1
@entity1 was not yet a public company and it was desperately trying to transition into being a mobile - first company			2
a phone made sense , in part , because the native mobile app experience was so poor			2
not only were the old versions of @entity1 for @entity3 and @entity73 slow and lacking in feature parity with the website , the company had n't started to figure out a way to monetize the apps themselves and offer mobile ad units to buyers			1
at the same time , while @entity3 was dominating the mobile landscape from a global perspective , @entity78 had n't solidified its role as the defacto face of the platform			2
plus , most phones running @entity3 in 2011 and into 2012 were running @entity85			2
a customized version of @entity3 built around @entity1 was appealing , because @entity3 itself was still lacking in polish and with some core functionality			1
that 's no longer the case			0
with every release , @entity3 gets better looking and better performing			0
android 4.2 @entity94 is its best yet and we 're expecting to see an even newer version at @entity97 in may			0
moreover , the face of @entity3 is no longer @entity99 , it 's @entity78			0
the @entity101 brand is tremendously powerful , with the @entity102 alone selling over 50 million units since june			0
plus , @entity1 is improving on the mobile front			0
its mobile apps are native now and the company has mobile ad units and is making changes to its core products — such as the @entity110 — to be mobile first and properly monetized			0
the market for third place is crowded @entity1 has over a billion users on the desktop , but its phone ecosystem wo n't pop up over night			1
even if it uses @entity3 as a base , one has to assume that if @entity1 makes a phone , it will want to have more control than allowed as part of @entity99 's @entity121			1
for better or worse , that would mean that it would need to be its own platform			0
@entity31 and @entity3 proper make up the vast majority of the smartphone space			2
the battle for third place is n't just being fought by @entity128 and @entity129 ; it 's also facing competition from the smaller mobile os 's such as @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 those companies are already making inroads in emerging markets , where it 's easier to disrupt the @entity73 / @entity3 duopoly			0
@entity1 would n't just be competing with @entity73 and @entity99 's version of @entity3 — it would also be competing with carriers to actually give the phone a chance			1
@entity144 — a company with a much longer and stronger history in mobile — has struggled to gain traction with carriers			0
only now , after more than two years of work , is the company outselling @entity73 in a few select markets			0
if @entity1 thinks it can just waltz in and get carriers to agree to sell its phone , it 's mistaken			2
companies such as @entity156 and @entity157 — companies that sell more phones than @entity11 , i might add — struggle to get major @entity161 carriers to pick up their products , and those products run @entity3 proper			0
@entity1 will have a hard time getting carriers not only to agree to carry a @entity1 phone , but to promote it			1
right now , when a user walks into a store , she has to choose from among a few different @entity170 models , a countless array of @entity3 devices , some @entity128 8 models and even the @entity174			2
plus , even if @entity1 does make its own phone , it 's not as if the company can ignore other platforms			2
the company has to be ubiquitous and offer its apps and services to everyone			0
does it really make sense for @entity1 to invest the time and resources in further fragmenting the phone space , when it still has to support the two big players anyway ? what does make sense : a @entity1 app store for @entity3 while i 'm not convinced that a phone in any sense makes sense for @entity1 , it 's clear that @entity1 does need to get its hooks deeper into mobile			1
for a @entity1 phone to be worthwhile — @entity17 is right — it ca n't be just 10 or 20 million , it has to have massive scale			1
@entity1 will have a hard time achieving that scale with its own phone and os. but that does n't mean the company could n't still achieve that sort of scale by going another route			2
rather than building a phone and customizing its own version of @entity3 to fit its needs , @entity1 should take some cues from @entity208 and consider building its own @entity1 app store that runs on @entity3 devices			1
by app store — i do n't just mean a copy of @entity214 or a place for developers to offer their apps on yet another store — i mean a way for @entity1 to offer mobile developers a way to build apps that interact and interface with @entity1 on a deeper level			1
these apps could interface with the native @entity1 interface more fluidly — and maybe even let developers bring their traditional @entity1 apps to @entity3 in a way that does n't require the same commitment as building a traditional @entity3 app. plus , an app store would be a good market test to see if the demand for a @entity1 phone actually exists			1
after all , it would be a lot easier to launch a phone with a slew of supported mobile apps and deep integration			0
look , at one point , a @entity1 phone might have made sense			1
in today 's climate and crowded mobile market , that 's no longer the case			0
this commentary reflects the opinions of the author and not necessarily those of @entity253 or @entity0			0

@entity1 is holding an @entity3 - related press event on april 4
the event has *reignited* speculation about a possible @entity1 phone
@entity262 : the timing is *wrong* , and the market is too crowded
@entity262 : instead , a @entity1 app store for @entity3 would make more sense
