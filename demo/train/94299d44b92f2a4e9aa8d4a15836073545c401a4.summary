a pair of polls released show @entity3 sen. @entity2 falling behind his @entity5 opponent in the tight @entity7 race for his seat			0
a @entity10 poll released thursday shows @entity2 trailing rep. @entity11 by eight points			1
the poll comes less than a day after a @entity16 / @entity15 poll showed the race as a statistical dead heat , with @entity11 leading the incumbent , 43 % to 42 %			1
the two nonpartisan polls are the first time @entity2 has been behind his opponent since the last @entity10 poll gave @entity11 a 2 - point lead in july			1
the race has looked like a tough contest since @entity11 jumped into it , but polling over the last two weeks has given @entity2 a 2 - to 6 - point edge over his @entity5 opponent			1
@entity2 's campaign manager @entity31 acknowledged on @entity32 that his candidate is locked in a tight race , but dismissed any " wild swings like you see in the news			1
" @entity5 are closer than ever to retaking the @entity38 since @entity3 took control in 2006 , and a @entity5 win in @entity7 could help tip the balance			0
@entity2 has tried to put daylight between his positions and president @entity45 's policies as the president 's poll numbers have dipped			0
the @entity16 / @entity15 poll showed 55 % had an unfavorable view of @entity45			2
and while @entity7 gov. @entity49 shared a beer with @entity45 in @entity51 in july , @entity2 was n't in the picture for the photo - op. he was originally scheduled to attend a @entity51 fundraiser with the president , but made a last - minute change to stay on @entity56 for a vote			0
