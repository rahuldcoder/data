exactly a year ago , more than 1,000 people lost their lives when a nine - story factory building collapsed suddenly in @entity3			1
it was one of the darkest days in @entity6 's recent history			1
the majority of those killed or injured were garment workers , but they represented just a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people employed in hundreds of factories dotted around the @entity6 capital			1
unfortunately , the @entity15 catastrophe on april 24 , 2013 was not unique			0
only five months earlier , 117 workers died when a fire ripped through the @entity19 clothing factory on the outskirts of @entity3			1
the @entity15 disaster in @entity3 's @entity23 district did , however , spark an international outcry about the conditions millions of @entity6 workers endure each day : those who were killed spent their last moments working for a pittance , manufacturing clothes for major global brands in appalling conditions			1
as a result , the @entity6 government , along with international organizations and foreign retailers , pledged to compensate victims ' grieving families and improve the state of factories across the country			1
a year on and those efforts are continuing though many promises remain unfulfilled			2
safety measures are being improved and more stringent standards are being introduced			1
however , compensation to victims ' families remains shrouded in uncertainty			1
" the incident was a wake - up call , " @entity50 , country director for @entity52 charity @entity51 told @entity53			2
" efforts are being taken on different levels in terms of safety and other related matters			2
but in terms of the rights of workers , that issue is unsolved			2
it has been one year and there is no coordinated plan to provide compensation			1
" empty promises ? after widespread criticism of workers ' rights , the government revised its labor laws			2
under the @entity6 @entity75 , workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions , and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5 % of their profits toward a workers ' welfare fund			1
the government also boosted minimum wages from $ 38 to around $ 68 per month			2
yet for many thousands of families affected by the 2013 disaster , there is little or no respite			1
@entity90 and her husband , @entity91 , were employed in two different garment factories located at @entity15			1
when the whole building came crashing down that morning , @entity90 , who was pregnant with her first child , was pulled out of the rubble by a rescuer			2
but @entity91 was n't as fortunate			0
support from charity organizations helped @entity90 pay the medical bills , while the meager government aid enabled her to cover her husband 's funeral costs			0
now she struggles to make ends meet			0
" compensation ! what 's that ? i have n't received anything yet , not even for my son , " she told @entity51 after the tragedy			2
according to @entity90 , even individual donors have stopped sending money			0
" who cares about a dead man in such a country where the living people even can not enjoy their rights ? " @entity90 's story resonates with many other survivors interviewed by @entity51			0
according to a recent survey carried out by the charity , 74 % of 1,436 survivors of the disaster who were interviewed continue to nurse their injuries and their ongoing trauma			0
a small number claim they have been refused jobs in other garment factories because they say employers are reluctant to hire them amid fears they might engage in labor activism			1
disagreements continue between the government , factory owners and foreign retailers over who should contribute to compensation , with observers suggesting this would be an admission of guilt			2
this has further slowed the disbursement of claims			0
" there has been haphazard financial aid -- some coming from employers , some from the prime minister 's fund			2
there is no coordination , " says @entity51 's @entity153			0
she says only $ 3 million of the $ 16 million set aside in the prime minister 's fund had been distributed , as of a month ago			1
following the disaster , international organizations and trade unions pledged a fund of $ 40 million to aid those affected			1
the @entity163 is running this trust fund , and payments from it will be released to the victims by a claims process			2
however , according to a joint statement released by global trade unions @entity172 and @entity173 , along with the labor rights network @entity170 , the fund has been able to raise only a third of that amount so far			0
only half of the 29 global brands and retailers that sourced garments from the factories in the plaza have contributed to this fund , including @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			1
" nearly all brands have failed to make a significant enough contribution and we are calling on them to increase their donations immediately , " the statement said			0
one of the biggest contributors , @entity52 fashion chain @entity194 is also offering long - term compensation amounting to $ 9 million for the workers employed in factories producing garments for the company			1
the brand 's website says payments began last month and the whole process will be completed by june this year			0
safety standards at present @entity6 has less than 200 qualified inspectors and officials have said it will take at least five years to check working and safety conditions in all factories			1
in february , the government issued orders to increase the number of labor and factory inspectors to 575			0
two initiatives introduced last year have tried to improve conditions for employees in the $ 20 billion dollar garments industry in @entity6			1
one pact -- the @entity220 for @entity221 and @entity222 is a legally binding initiative that mandates signatory companies to undertake inspections of garment factories as well as training of workers			1
so far , 150 companies have signed the accord , including @entity232 retailers like @entity233 and @entity234			0
the @entity235 is a voluntary , industry - sponsored agreement to provide similar measures			0
it includes 26 brands , all of them @entity241 or @entity242 , among them @entity240			0
the @entity235 has inspected 400 of the 640 factories used by the organization 's members , a process it plans to complete by july , while the @entity220 plans to inspect a total 1,500 factories by september for electrical , fire and building safety			1
inspections have so far revealed an unflattering picture			0
" there is not one factory that does n't need improvement , " says @entity252 , senior adviser to the @entity235			0
" the majority of them do not have the necessary protection to prevent fire hazards -- a sprinkler system , fire doors , adequate water capacity to suppress fire			0
" the @entity235 has ordered one factory to be shut down and recommended the closure of another			0
however , efforts to implement stricter measures are drawing the ire of garment factory associations and trade unions , who say the industry does n't have the necessary infrastructure nor the finances to adhere to these standards			1
others are concerned about the loss of income to workers if the factories close down for renovation			2
turning pledges into action several solutions are being suggested by the two groups and foreign retailers : allowing garment manufacturers in the country easy access to loans , giving businesses tax holidays to help them renovate factories , and compensating workers for any loss of income incurred due to the temporary suspension			1
the garment industry is @entity6 's largest export earner			1
many fear worker safety issues are all too often ignored in the interests of greater trade , with some alleging that during any crises the national garment industry association sides with the owners			2
following the incident , prime minister @entity306 told @entity53 that she was n't worried about international companies stalling their business in the country			0
" investors have tapped into the @entity6 market not just because of its high - quality workers , " she said			1
" they get cheap labor			0
that 's why they come here			0
" according to @entity153 , there needs to be coordinated efforts and accountability from all stakeholders -- the government , factory owners and retailers			0
otherwise , " @entity15 like @entity325 will be forgotten , " she says			0
" this past year , we have seen a lot of pledges from brands , manufacturers and the government			0
we need to see them translate that into action , transaction and political commitment			0
" watch : go inside a @entity6 garment factory			1

over 1,000 garment workers died and thousands were injured in the building collapse in @entity3 , @entity6 last year
only one - third of the $ 40 million compensation fund for families of those affected has been *collected* so far
inspection of the garment factories reveal lack of adequate safety standards in most of them
