-- achievers , raise your @entity3 tumblers because this " obsessions " is for you			0
do you hate the @entity6 ? do you bowl ? compulsively drink @entity7 ( er , @entity8 ) ? is your only form of identification a @entity12 card ? got a rug that really ties the room together ? you 're not alone , man			0
when the @entity20 ' " @entity19 " hit theaters in 1998 it was , well , a gutter ball , earning just $ 17.5 million			1
the film starred @entity22 as " @entity19 , " @entity23 as @entity25 vet and @entity26 convert @entity27 , @entity28 as feminist artist @entity29 , @entity30 as loyal pal @entity31 and @entity32 as bowling rival / pedophile " the @entity34			1
" but the @entity1 ( the fans of the movie ) eventually found it , on @entity38 and then dvd and now @entity40 , making it the cult phenomenon it is today			1
it soon inspired the fan - run @entity42 -- an event that takes place in various cities throughout the year			1
this week , @entity1 gathered in @entity47 for a very special incarnation of @entity42 marking the film 's long - awaited @entity49			1
the event was held at @entity52 's @entity51			0
the red carpet was the film 's famous stolen rug that " really tied the room together			1
" we media folk on the red carpet were a mix of @entity1 , and those who really only wanted to talk to @entity22 about his new album and to @entity30 about " @entity63			1
" we abided , and i was lucky enough to be standing next to two guys who debated which fictional porn movie was better : " @entity67 ' " or " @entity68			0
" @entity23 spoke to @entity0 on the red carpet			1
he told us that the line from " @entity19 " he is asked to quote most often is , " shut the f * * k up , @entity31			1
" the actor maintains he had no idea the film would be so highly worshipped by fans			2
" absolutely not , " said @entity23			2
" it 's the most fun i ever had working on a film			1
i never thought about it actually being released			0
" he also noted that his favorite scene " changes all the time			0
) i like the scene where he 's getting grilled by the @entity83 police , but really , it changes a lot			0
" when asked if he is ever as intense as his " @entity19 " character , the hot - headed @entity27 , @entity23 said , " @entity86 , i hope not ! " @entity22 admitted that he shares some character traits with the dude , including a laid - back attitude and a fondness for the tunes of @entity92			1
also , he stated that the clear plastic jelly sandals the dude wears in " @entity19 , " along with some other clothing items , were his own			2
red carpet arrivals were followed by a q&a moderated by @entity98 's @entity97			2
the panel consisted of @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity32 , @entity28 , @entity30 and music archivist @entity100 on the @entity51 's stage			1
@entity32 gave a shout - out to his costume which can best be described as a grape - bubblegum - colored polyester jumpsuit			0
" all actors have to credit their costumes , " joked @entity32 , who said that after the film 's release he " got a lot of sex mail			2
" when @entity30 had the floor , the @entity1 shouted , in unison , " shut the f * * k up , @entity31 ! " to which the actor replied , " first of all , you shut the f * * k up ! " @entity30 said he had the cast sign a bowling ball as a keepsake , and that when he approached actor @entity123 ( the sarsaparilla - sipping stranger ) for an autograph , the actor replied in his signature folksy voice , " man , i do n't usually do this			2
" @entity28 told the crowd that what attracted her to the film was @entity29 's unique way of speaking			2
" i loved the language , " said the actress , who joked , " it 's not an accent , it 's an affectation			0
" @entity28 also told the crowd that her most cherished memento from the set is n't one of the coveted bowling pin hats , it 's her 13 - year - old son			0
the actress became pregnant in the middle of filming			0
after leading the crowd in a yoga - inspired @entity146 ( yup , we @entity147 with @entity19 ) , @entity22 wrapped up the talk by telling the group what message he hopes people take away from " @entity19 , " which just happens to be one of the film 's most quotable lines , " that 's just , like , your opinion , man			1
" " @entity19 " is one of those movies where you notice something new during every viewing			0
for example , did you know the opening scene takes place exactly a decade before 9/11 ? the next time you watch the film , you 'll see that when the @entity19 purchases a $ 0.69 carton of half & half , which he pays for by check , the date he writes is september 11 , 1991			1
and , as he 's signing the check , president @entity173 is seen giving a speech on the store 's little tv set about how aggression against @entity179 " will not stand			0
a screening of the film was held after the q&a , but the greatest entertainment of the night was by far the @entity1			0
they showed up in costume , smoked pot in the balcony , sipped @entity7 , shouted dialogue ( even while the actors were speaking on stage ) , and frankly , they really tied the room together .			0
