-- @entity2 is stripping the title of " honorary consul " from @entity5 , the @entity6 socialite embroiled in the scandal that brought down cia director @entity8 , a @entity2 official said monday			1
@entity5 will lose that designation after a @entity12 businessman accused her of trying to use the honorary title to solicit business , deputy foreign minister @entity9 told the semi-official @entity2 news agency @entity15			1
" it 's not suitable to the status of honorary consul that ( she ) sought to be involved in commercial projects and peddle influence			2
it 's also inappropriate as honorary consul , " @entity15 quoted @entity9 as telling @entity2 reporters during a visit to @entity22			2
the @entity8 affair : who is @entity5 ? @entity5 's title , which carries no official responsibility , came to light after @entity8 abruptly resigned on november 9 and admitted to an extramarital affair			1
federal investigators learned of the affair after @entity5 complained to an @entity33 agent that she was receiving harassing e-mails from a woman later identified as @entity8 's mistress , @entity36			1
@entity5 and her husband , @entity37 , a doctor , hosted parties at their @entity40 home for top officers at the nearby headquarters of @entity43			0
after @entity8 resigned , @entity5 soon found herself facing questions about flirty e-mails shared with another top @entity47 commander , gen. @entity46 , and she invoked her honorary title when she called police on november 11 to complain about reporters besieging her home			1
@entity5 asked for $ 80 million to influence @entity2 deal , businessman says " i am an honorary consul general , " @entity5 tells police on a recording of the call			1
" ... i have inviolability			0
they should not be on my property			0
i do n't know if you want to get diplomatic , uh , protection involved as well			0
" @entity2 officials tell @entity0 that " an honorary consul can generally play a role of promoting trade and economic cooperation between the two countries			2
" it does not , however , carry diplomatic immunity			0
a few days later , a @entity12 businessman told @entity0 that @entity5 asked him for an $ 80 million commission if she used her influence to win a @entity2 business contract			1
she claimed to have been a high - level representative of the @entity2 government , energy executive @entity74 said			0
tricky nature of investigating gen. @entity46 's emails @entity5 has kept a low profile and has not returned @entity0 phone calls seeking comment about the " honorary consul " title			2
@entity46 , the current @entity47 commander in @entity86 , has denied any wrongdoing , a senior defense official told @entity0 , and sources familiar with @entity5 have said the relationship between the two was not sexual			0
the @entity91 has said that president @entity92 continues to have faith in @entity46 's leadership -- but @entity46 's nomination to become @entity97 's supreme allied commander has been put on hold pending the outcome of an investigation , @entity91 spokesman @entity90 said .			0
