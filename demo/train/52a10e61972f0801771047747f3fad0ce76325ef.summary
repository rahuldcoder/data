-- the @entity2 contender to head the @entity3 , @entity4 , said wednesday she is ready to lead from day one and would make it a nimbler , more responsive organization			1
@entity4 told @entity0 's @entity8 she was the best candidate for the job because of her 25 years working at the bank and her time as @entity2 finance minister			1

" you do n't want to spend six months , a year , learning how the institution functions before you can lead -- i can lead from the word go , " she said , speaking from @entity19 , @entity20			0
president @entity22 on friday presented dr. @entity23 , the president of @entity24 , as the @entity26 nominee for the role			1
while the @entity3 's influence is felt most directly in the developing world , an @entity26 has always headed the bank			1
the organization expects to pick the new president by its spring meeting in the week of april 16			0
@entity4 said she welcomed the competition posed by @entity23 , whose background is in medicine , not economics or business as has been the case with most previous @entity3 presidents			1
" i am not daunted ... because the shareholders of the @entity3 promised a fair , merit - based , open and competitive process , " she said			1
@entity4 , a @entity43 - educated economist and former senior @entity3 official , said her role as head of the @entity2 finance ministry had provided a valuable practical grounding			1
" this is not theory you are dealing with , it 's fact , it 's experience , it 's real world , ' how do we make a policy decision that will help millions of poor people today ? ' -- so that gives me a lot , " she said			2
she said her chief aim if picked to lead the bank would be to make it a faster and nimbler organization , able to respond swiftly to problems in developing countries			2
the bank should also focus on promoting growth in developing nations to create jobs , especially for young people , she said			0
" i 've never met a poor person who did n't want the dignity of a job -- if they have a job , they can take care of their health problems , their education problems , " she said			0

under a tacit agreement in place since their inception , an @entity26 has always led the @entity3 while a @entity109 has been in charge of the @entity94			1
the @entity3 and the @entity94 get funding from their members , also known as shareholders , and it is this funding that is the basis for voting power on the organizations ' boards			0
the board will vote on the new leader for the bank , but it is widely assumed that the @entity26 nominee will be the one confirmed by the full body			2
as the largest contributor to the @entity3 and the @entity94 , the @entity26 has the most voting shares on their boards at roughly 16 %			1
