-- it seems that in recent years , @entity2 has been " baby crazy , " and celebrity followers have flocked to entertainment shows , websites and magazines with a voracious hunger to get the latest news on which stars are expecting a visit from the stork			2
gossip columns relish in playing the " is she or is n't she ? " game			2
magazines engage in fierce bidding wars to run the first photos of a new celebrity baby			2
celeb kids such as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 often get as much , if not more , press as their famous parents			2
baby bumps and due dates are increasingly popular topics of conversation on the red carpet			0
you 've seen the names in recent headlines -- @entity34 , @entity35 and , most recently , @entity36 -- but one celebrity has been slightly ignored in the realm of celebrity baby watchers : @entity40			1
rumor has it that the singer / actress / reality show star / fashion designer is pregnant with her first child with her @entity45 © , former @entity47 player @entity46			2
but , besides from some idle speculation , not much has been made of the blessed event -- well , except for some jokes at @entity52 ' expense			2
she has been seen strolling around with a rotund tummy , most recently holding hands with @entity46 while rubbing said belly			1
on monday tweeted confirmation that she is pregnant by posing in a mummy costume and cradling her belly with the words " it 's true -- @entity64 " m going to be a mummy ! " despite the added tidbit that @entity40 's ex @entity67 quarterback @entity66 recently announced at a local event that " i actually have one on the way " with his wife , the interest in a @entity40 's pregnancy seems decidedly muted			1
according to outlets like the @entity77 , @entity40 's father / manager , @entity75 , has n't even been successful in getting the media to bite			1
stories are circulating that he has been trying to sell the story of the alleged pregnancy ( and , of course the first mama / baby photos ) to the tabloids , possibly because his daughter has been seen about town sporting what appears to be a rather obvious baby bump			1
so why are n't the celebrity - driven media going ga - ga about this star mama ? you could try to attribute the lack of interest about the future baby boy or baby girl @entity40 to some sort of collective " baby fatigue , " but that theory does n't stand up to the hoopla that surrounded the first public appearance of @entity102 and @entity104 's twin babies , @entity105 and @entity106 ( accompanied by not only a " 20/20 " interview with @entity108 but a week 's worth of teasers showing just the backs of their heads )			1
we 'd like to offer a couple of theories as to why the entertainment industry and fans are generally apathetic to the @entity40 pregnancy : the @entity120 defense : we know who the father is when actresses fail to disclose the name of the child 's father , we become all the more curious about the offspring			1
take the recent case of " @entity130 " star @entity128			0
a number of actors have been fingered as potential fathers of @entity135 ' son , @entity134			0
the mystery daddy is n't a new phenomenon			0
remember when @entity138 and her then - girlfriend enlisted the services of an undisclosed sperm donor to father their children , only to get even more attention when it was revealed that the donor in question was legendary rocker @entity147 ? @entity46 has been the only man in @entity40 's life for quite a while , and there 's no doubt as to paternity			1
if @entity40 had been seen around town with maybe a former flame like @entity155 or even the aforementioned @entity66 , she could have gotten some tongues wagging			1
scandal ? what scandal ? exactly			0
it may boil down to a lack of interest in @entity40 as a headline - grabbing celebrity			1
many women , myself included , would say she 's got an impressive line of shoes , but as of late , she has n't done much of note -- either famously or infamously			0
she has n't had a hit single in quite a while			0
her films have been largely straight - to - video flops ( " @entity173 " or " @entity174 , " anyone ? ) and she 's not been able to replicate her success in the reality tv genre after the demise of " newlyweds : @entity180 " ( " @entity182 " on @entity183 just did n't cut it )			0
@entity52 ca n't even register much of a blip in the scandal sheets			0
her biggest scandal in the past few years revolves around her questionable taste in pants ( the infamous " @entity190 " incident of 2009 )			0
her upcoming reality project , " @entity192 , " could get her back in the headlines , but we suggest a @entity196 nude pregnancy photo shoot to get a little tabloid love			2
the name game maybe we just have to wait until @entity40 gives birth to draw some attention to her imminent motherhood			1
the announcement of celebrity baby names is quite a big deal in the entertainment press , especially when the chosen name is n't one you 're likely to hear on the playground any time soon , like @entity209 's son @entity209 or @entity212 's son @entity211 if @entity40 wants some guaranteed media attention , she could name her kid @entity214			1
it 's no secret ; millions of people have babies every day			0
but , it 's slightly ironic that a woman whose first marriage and divorce we watched faithfully on the boob tube has lost the audience for the possible birth of her first child			0
regardless if anyone outside her immediate family cares , since she 's due for a blessed event , that should be her top priority -- headline or no headline .			0

new : @entity40 confirms her pregnancy
there is speculation that @entity40 may be pregnant , but not much buzz
@entity40 has been *spotted* around town rubbing a protruding belly
