@entity0 -- new @entity5 military intelligence suggests @entity6 plans to smuggle new shipments of weapons into @entity9 in the coming weeks as part of an increased effort to interfere with coalition operations , a senior @entity3 official said friday			1
the information came from an " @entity6 source " whose tips on past shipments have been verified by the @entity5 , the official said			1
the official declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information			0
he also declined to offer more details on the identity of the @entity6 source			2
intelligence gained by talking to people , sometimes referred to as " human intelligence , " is always considered sensitive for fear of compromising sources			0
" there are indications the @entity6 have stepped it up , " the official said			0
but another @entity5 official said @entity6 is only providing " limited supplies of weapons to the @entity37 ... not enough to cause major problems for coalition forces			1
" the official also noted that @entity6 -- a majority @entity42 country -- and the @entity44 @entity37 almost went to war with one another in the late 90s , so it 's not really in their interest to be a major source of top - shelf arms to the @entity37			1
earlier this week , however , adm. @entity51 , chairman of the @entity52 , told reporters in @entity9 he was ' taken aback " when he learned of a " significant shipment " of weapons from @entity6 into @entity57 in southeastern @entity9			1
@entity51 and his aides declined to offer any other details			0
and the @entity3 official said the source has told the @entity5 of " volumes of @entity6 munitions coming into @entity9			1
" @entity64 has consistently denied supporting groups opposed to the @entity9 government			1
@entity5 and coalition troops have seen evidence of some @entity6 weapons inside @entity9 found in seized caches or in the aftermath of attacks			2
some munitions have recent manufacturing dates and serial numbers			0
" that leads us to believe there are ongoing and current shipments coming into @entity9 from @entity6 , " the official said			1
the @entity6 weapons include not only rockets and grenades but also material and explosives to make improvised explosive devices			0
the official said the @entity5 has found high explosives that are clearly manufactured in @entity6 with a particular process and design " similar to what we saw with @entity6 weapons in @entity92			2
" the @entity3 official said some of the upcoming shipments might be designated for @entity57 , adding that the @entity5 military would do everything it could to stop that from happening			1
the official indicated it had been several months since coalition forces had seized any weapons shipments at @entity9 's western border with @entity6			1
authorities believe shipments are broken up into smaller loads at the border and then brought into the country as unobtrusively as possible by truck convoys			0
the issue of just how much @entity6 is interfering inside @entity9 remains under debate in the administration 's national security circles			0
recently , defense secretary @entity114 accused @entity6 of playing a " double game " in @entity9 , both aiding the @entity37 and more publicly helping finance some public institutions			2
but he then described @entity6 assistance to the @entity37 as " pretty low - level			0
" " we have really not seen an increase of @entity6 assistance , whether it 's equipment or weapons or training , in western @entity9 , " @entity114 told reporters on february 22			2
" we 're obviously keeping an eye on it , but it seems pretty modest at this point			0

@entity130 was from *reliable* " @entity6 source , " the @entity3 official said
" limited supplies " of weapons wo *n't* cause major problems , another official said
@entity52 chair said this week he was ' taken aback " by news of @entity6 arms shipments
@entity64 has consistently denied helping @entity9 *anti-government* forces
