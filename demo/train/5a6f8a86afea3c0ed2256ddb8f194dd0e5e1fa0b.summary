-- @entity3 president @entity4 will meet with @entity6 president @entity5 in @entity7 next week before international talks are held on @entity6 's nuclear program in @entity10 , @entity3 's state - run @entity2 news agency reported sunday			1
the meeting is aimed at allowing @entity4 to " feel the heat surrounding the @entity6 problem and see how this issue is perceived in @entity18 , " @entity11 , a former @entity12 ambassador who now serves as a @entity3 foreign policy adviser , told the news agency			2
@entity4 and @entity5 will meet on the sidelines of the 12th @entity22 summit , to be held june 6 - 7 in @entity23			0
the @entity12 , @entity27 , @entity3 , @entity7 , @entity28 and @entity29 -- the so - called " @entity30 , a reference to @entity29 plus the permanent members of the @entity33 -- will meet in @entity10 for another round of talks on @entity6 's nuclear program june 18 - 19			1
" we were n't too happy with the results of the last round of talks , but we determined the mutual readiness to continue the discussion , " @entity11 told @entity2			0
at the @entity10 meeting , he said , @entity3 will " promote the thought that @entity6 's right to develop peaceful energy under the oversight of the @entity44 should be approved			1
" world powers , particularly @entity48 nations , suspect that @entity6 wants to build nuclear weapons , although @entity18 insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			1
last month , during a round of talks with the @entity30 in @entity54 , @entity6 rejected calls to stop the high enrichment of uranium that can be used for weapons , while the international powers refused @entity18 's demand for an immediate end to sanctions imposed by the @entity33 , the @entity12 and the @entity63 that are crippling its economy			1
because 80 % of @entity6 's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports , an embargo by the @entity63 set to take effect in july will put further pressure on its economy			1
@entity3 historically has been hesitant to support sanctions on @entity18			0
in november , it called a new round of sanctions " unacceptable , " saying they hinder efforts to reach a diplomatic solution			0
" @entity3 sees such extraterritorial measures as unacceptable and against international law , " said a statement from the @entity78 , issued a day after the new sanctions were announced			0
" such a practice seriously obstructs advancement toward a constructive dialogue with @entity18			0
stronger sanction pressure , which some of our partners see almost as a goal in itself , will not encourage @entity6 to sit down at the negotiating table			0
" just after the @entity54 talks , the @entity33 's @entity44 said its inspectors found a high level of enriched uranium in @entity6			2
the nuclear watchdog agency asked @entity18 to explain the presence of particles of enrichment levels up to 27 % found in an analysis of environmental samples taken in february at the @entity101 fuel enrichment plant near the city of @entity103			2
the previous highest level had been 20 % , typically used for hospital isotopes and research reactors			0
to build nuclear weapons , 90 % enrichment is required			1
@entity6 said in response that the production of such particles " above the target value " may happen for " technical reasons beyond the operator 's control			2
" the @entity44 said it is " assessing @entity6 's explanation and has requested further details			1

the two *leaders* will meet next week in @entity7 , according to media reports
an international round of talks on @entity6 's nuclear program is set for later this month
world powers are concerned @entity6 wants to build nuclear weapons
@entity18 insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes
