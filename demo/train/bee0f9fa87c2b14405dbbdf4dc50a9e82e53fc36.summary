-- @entity1 ran up the stairs near her home in @entity4 , @entity5			1
if other early - morning exercisers had wandered by , they would have heard her whispering to the fat on her legs : " go away			2
you 're going to go away			2
" @entity14 pictured herself as a smaller person -- someone who was able to go shopping and buy the cute clothes she saw on the thrift store hangers			1
the mental image pushed her to do the beach stairs again despite the rising temperature			2
bad habits from an early age @entity14 and her siblings lived primarily with their grandmother when they were young			1
once a month , @entity28 bought groceries with money from her pension and @entity33 check			2
" the first of the month i would chow down , " @entity14 remembers , because " by the end of the month we would be barely having anything			1
" " growing up poor , living off rice and beans -- if we were lucky -- had a big impact on our eating habits , " says @entity14 's younger sister , @entity38			1
" no one ever told @entity44 and i to ' eat your vegetables			2
' " @entity14 used to steal cookies out of her cousins ' cupboards when she went to visit them			1
as the sisters got older , they started playing outside less and drinking more			2
they took money they earned working to splurge on the dollar menu at @entity58			2

@entity14 ordered fast food for lunch every day with her co-workers			1
she never exercised and hated vegetables			2
once in a while she attempted to lose weight , sometimes dropping 10 or 20 pounds			2
but something always made her sabotage her efforts			0
she figured her obesity was hereditary -- her aunts were all " short , chubby little ladies with big boobs			0
and that 's what i was			0
" creative by nature , @entity14 expressed her growing unhappiness in journals			1
she 'd draw photos of a fat woman crying , with word bubbles that said things such as " i 'm huge , and i hate myself			0
" what she hated most was shopping for clothes			0
she longed to buy the cute outfits she saw at swap meets or in stores but could only fit into what she calls the " @entity92 " - type dresses sold in her size : 22/24			0

in november 2011 , @entity100 's mother underwent heart valve replacement surgery			0
it was the wake - up call @entity100 needed to change her eating and exercise habits			0
the friends decided to start an office weight - loss competition			1
@entity14 was embarrassed stepping up to the scale for the first time in may 2012 -- " no one wants to show that they weigh 224 pounds in front of guys " -- but the number that flashed on the scale simply reinforced her commitment			1
she and @entity100 began walking on their 10 - minute breaks and sharing healthy recipes they found online			2
@entity14 also used the lose it ! app to track her calorie intake			1
she exercised six days a week , walking on the beach for four miles or running the stairs			1
it was hardest at social gatherings with her friends ; they 'd be drinking beer and eating burgers , while @entity14 tried to stick with skinless chicken breasts and vegetables			1
" my friends still love to have parties , " she says			0
" i 'm kind of like an old lady			0
i come home , work out , eat dinner , watch ' @entity92 ' and go to sleep			0
" by the end of the challenge , @entity14 had lost 49 pounds			1
she had also lost the competition -- the winner beat her by losing just 1 % more of his body weight			1
" i totally cried , " she remembers with a laugh			0
" i was n't trying to be a sore loser , but i think i worked my butt off			0
" before that fateful day , @entity14 swore to @entity100 she would celebrate the end of the competition with a large , cheesy pizza			1
" i never got that pizza			0
" ' you are tiny ' when @entity14 showed up at her family 's annual @entity154 dinner in 2012 , she was wearing jeans for the first time in years			1
she was also wearing a top that was way too big for her , says @entity159 , her sister			0
@entity14 went shopping a few months later and called her sister to tell her the good news : she now fit into a small shirt size			1
" i said , ' @entity44 , i told you			0
