-- on friday , the @entity2 football team was supposed to host a rival team in a homecoming game			1
but instead of taking the field , seven @entity6 , @entity7 , players were taken into custody , arrested and charged in flagrant sexual assaults on younger players			1
many have referred to the incident as pervasive locker room " hazing			0
" what allegedly happened is n't just hazing , it 's rape			1
" it would start with a howling noise from a senior football player at @entity2 , and then the locker room lights were abruptly shut off , " @entity18 reported ( citing information from the parent of one victim )			1
" in the darkness , a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker - room floor , his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen			1
then , the victim would be lifted to his feet " and sexually abused			0
if that 's not enough to make you sick to your stomach , consider that these attacks allegedly happened several times -- between september 19 and september 29 -- and to four separate victims			2
consider that there were dozens of players in these locker rooms who allegedly witnessed the rapes and hazing and did nothing to stop , report or thwart them			2
one bright spot in this horrific story is dr. @entity50 , the superintendent who acted swiftly and definitively			2
on october 2 , when a parent and student first reported the alleged assaults , the superintendent immediately canceled and forfeited that evening 's football game because of a " serious and unforeseen circumstances			1
" over the next couple of days , more information came to light , prompting @entity50 to cancel the entire season because of " incidences of harassment , intimidation and bullying as constituted by the definition within the anti-bullying statute that took place on a pervasive level			1
" his decision was unanimously upheld by the board of education			0
the only thing more disgusting than these allegations are the reactions of the parents in @entity6 who showed up at the board of education meeting to protest			1
you only need to read the comments of the mom of one football captain who was questioned by police to understand just how whacked some people are			2
as she sees it : " no one was hurt			0
i do n't understand why they 're being punished			2
i think that the forfeited game was punishment enough			0
" seems the denial among some parents is just as pervasive as the crimes going on in the locker rooms			0
to the parents complaining about lost scholarship opportunities , the fact is that if these charges are true , your son does n't deserve a scholarship ; he deserves jail time			2
among the litany of charges , three of the players are charged with aggravated sexual assault , which carries a five - year sentence if convicted in juvenile court			1
however , the prosecutor could charge all or some of the players as adults , which would mean substantially more prison time , leave them with criminal records and require their registration as sexual offenders			1
so far , @entity50 has handled this crisis flawlessly			0
so what should he do next ? 1			0
fire the entire football coaching staff			2
many parents are standing by head coach @entity118 , who has brought home multiple championships and run the football program for 20 years			1
he may win on the field , but he is a loser as a leader			0
either he and his staff are grossly negligent for not knowing what was happening , or they knew and did nothing			2
either way , it 's appalling			0
what was allegedly going on in their locker rooms is what you 'd expect from a street gang or a prison yard , not a high school football team			1
the coach and his staff are responsible for the safety and well - being of their players and by allowing 60 to 70 high school boys to be repeatedly unsupervised in a locker room , the coaching staff put these freshman players in harm 's way			1
cancel next season , too			1
culture takes a long time to change , unless it 's forced to change			0
there was a pervasive abusive culture in that @entity6 locker room , and my hunch is it 's been happening for years			1
you need to send a message to the players , the parents , the victims and the entire community that this will not be tolerated			1
and for those players who were n't " involved , " guess what : if you knew about the hazing and did nothing , you were " involved " and should feel the sting of punishment , too			1
sports commentator @entity170 said something very powerful about the hazing incident involving former @entity174 player @entity173 , who was suspended after allegations of pervasive racial harassment of @entity177			0
referring to the players who witnessed the alleged hazing , @entity170 said : " if you allow @entity173 to walk around ( the locker room ) and use a racial epithet , that all black @entity184 know the stigma and hate and vitriol that comes with that word -- if you allow him to do that , you 're encouraging him to do that			2
" to change culture , the message must be clear : abuse , bullying and hazing will not be tolerated at @entity6 , and neither will indifference			1
find the truth , the whole truth			0
the truth will come out			0
prosecutors will be calling every player in individually for questioning			0
players will be asked under oath about the howling , turning off the lights , holding victims down , who did what , how often , whether there were videos or photos			1
we are at the beginning of this story , because i am certain it did n't start with this season			1
a locker room does not go from towel snapping to anal rape overnight			0
i can only wonder what was done to the seven boys who were arrested when they were freshmen in that locker room			2
it does n't excuse their alleged actions if they were victims of similar crimes , but it does help explain why it happened -- perhaps they were taught to do it			1
if that 's the case , they were once victims , too , and it should be part of the facts considered when the courts determine their fate			0
and to the heroes in this story , the student victims who came forward : our hearts go out to you , and we are all moved by your courage			0
it 's extremely difficult to stand up to abuse , and there 's no doubt you saved future students from the same horrible fate			0
your parents must be so very proud of you for having the guts to ask for help			0
i hope you are also proud of yourselves			0
strength of character is a much more valuable asset in life than winning a football game will ever be .			0

coaches must be held *accountable* , even if they did n't know what was happening , she says
@entity272 : practices like this happen over years , so attackers may have been victims themselves
