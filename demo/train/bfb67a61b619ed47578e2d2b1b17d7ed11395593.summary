-- i 'm tired of being surrounded by cancer			1
over the past two years , i lost my sister , my mother and nearly lost my girlfriend to breast cancer and its complications			1
it 's an epidemic , and it seems we all just accept that as fact			1
i think it 's high time we said : enough			1
my lifelong friend @entity11 has been similarly affected by cancer			1
he has made it his life 's mission to change the way we think about this dreaded disease			1
it 's a different way of fighting a war on cancer : instead of focusing on treatments , drugs and experimental surgeries , it looks at what is going on in our environment and what we are eating , and considers what role those factors might play in the cancer epidemic			1
it 's not a popular place on the spectrum of debate about cancer			1
frankly , the corporations that pollute our environment and process our food do n't want to go anywhere near the message that comes from @entity42			2
it is simply not good for business			2
so i am riding to help people think about what causes cancer			1
sure , there is a genetic component to all of this			0
but that 's just part of the story			1
the other part of the story for me , is a very personal journey			0
four - and - a - half months ago , i had an accident that led to the amputation of my left arm			1
one of my goals for returning to normalcy was to get back on a bicycle -- something that was very important to me before i lost my arm			1
i probably would n't have decided to ride 300 miles over two days without the @entity67 event			1
as a matter fact , if i did , you might think i was a little bit crazy			0
as it is , a lot of people think it is ill - advised to set the bar so high so soon after my accident			2
and i 've been thinking a lot about why i have been pushing so hard , so soon			0
over the past few weeks i have been talking with @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity75 about my recovery			0
during my time with @entity75 , he repeatedly expressed incredulity over the pace that i have been keeping since i returned to my life minus an arm			2
he , like so many others , wonders if i 'm going too fast and not taking enough time to pause , reflect and grieve			0
when i stop to think about it , i too wonder if i am ultimately doing myself a disservice			0
should i be spending more time taking care of myself ? but then i think about how i would feel if i put myself on the sidelines at this point			0
i would be left wondering what i can do and what i may not be able to do			2
i simply need to know now			0
there might be a time bomb of grief ticking inside me that will explode later , but at least i 'll know my abilities when that time comes			0
i also think about the challenges that i have set for myself			0
three months after the accident , i was with my longtime friend and colleague @entity98 camping on a @entity101 glacier in @entity102 for a story we are doing on climate change			2
we snowshoed for miles , and i was shooting a lot of video in some very arduous conditions -- including at the bottom of a 15 - foot hole in the ice			2
i had definitely jumped into the deep end of my first big assignment after the accident			2
i was really nervous about how it might go , but after we had done the trip and we were sitting in the airport for our respective flights home , @entity98 turned to me and said , " i did n't see a bit of difference in your performance on this trip			0
" i could not have asked for better medicine than that			0
so i guess setting big goals in short order is n't such a bad idea , assuming you reach them			0
this goal -- 300 miles on a bicycle in two days -- is a reach , to be sure			1
but i am going to do my best			0
i have a fallback plan or two , including a tricycle called " @entity137 " that is ideally suited for a one - armed rider , and a cousin who has a tandem bicycle with a seat reserved for me			0
if all else fails , there 's always the sag wagon for a segment or two			2
but here 's what will keep me pedaling : i will be thinking about my sister , my mother , my ex-mother - in - law , both of my grandmothers , my girlfriend and everyone else i know whom i lost or nearly lost to cancer			1
their courage and grace while fighting this disease is an inspiration to me and should be to all of us			0
yes , i have a new challenge in my life , but frankly it pales by comparison when i consider what it 's like to be caught up in the cancer epidemic			1
we must find a way to stop it			0
i am neither a doctor nor a scientist -- although i play the latter on tv ! but in reality , what can we do ? for me , the answer is to pedal hard and long to @entity179 .			1

earlier this year , @entity182 's left arm was amputated after an accident
@entity182 plans to ride his bike 300 miles from @entity186 to @entity179 , @entity187
@entity182 says his struggle " pales by comparison " to cancer
