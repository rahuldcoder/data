it is easy to see the @entity2 teachers strike as an unfortunate incident that will soon pass			1
this is , after all , their first strike in 25 years			1
the norm is that the district and the @entity7 have regularly negotiated their way to contracts every several years			2
so it might appear that , almost always , collective bargaining " works			1
" but does it ? the purpose of the @entity2 school system — and of the @entity18 school system more generally — is to educate children			2
the way to assess collective bargaining is not to ask whether it works to bring labor peace			1
it is to ask whether it promotes the interests of children in a quality education			2
and the answer to that question is no , it does not			0
opinion : @entity18 would be better off with more strikes collective bargaining is not fundamentally about children			1
it is about the power and special interests of adults			2
in @entity2 and elsewhere , the teachers unions are in the business of winning better salaries and benefits , protecting job security , pressuring for restrictive work rules and in other ways advancing the occupational interests of their members			1
these interests are simply not the same as the interests of children			2
and they inevitably lead , through the exercise of union power , to contracts whose countless formal rules are literally not designed to create an effective organization for schools			2
in fact , they guarantee that the schools will be organized in perverse ways that no one in their right mind would favor if they just cared about what is best for kids			0
because of the formal rules that unions fight for in labor contracts , district leaders can almost never get bad teachers out of the classroom			1
nor can they allocate good teachers to the schools and classrooms where they can do the greatest good for kids			0
add to this that the evaluation process is a full - blown charade , and 99 % of all teachers , including the very worst teachers , are regularly given satisfactory evaluations			0
also , teachers are paid based on their seniority and formal credits , without any regard for whether their students are learning anything			0
this is a school system organized for the benefit of the people who work in it , not for the kids they are expected to teach			0
schools of thought : what are the key issues collective bargaining is not the only arena in which jobs take priority over kids			1
it also happens in the politics of state and national governments , which should be governing the public schools in the best interests of kids , but are n't			0
a major reason is that the teachers unions are by far the most powerful political force in @entity18 education			1
the @entity116 and the @entity117 have some 4.5 million members between them , they are among the top spenders in state and national elections , they have activists in virtually every electoral district in the country , they have formidable lobbying machines and much more			0
they are among the most powerful special interests of any type in the country			0
what have they done with all this political power ? for more than a quarter century , this country has been frantically trying to reform and bring real improvement , effective organization , to the public school system			1
and the unions have used their political power to block or seriously weaken these efforts : by preventing the spread of charter schools , undermining true accountability for schools and teachers , resisting performance pay , protecting teacher tenure and in countless ways defending a poorly performing status quo			1
every one of us pays the price			0
our children are being denied a quality education , fulfilling careers and productive lives			2
the nation is losing precious human capital , its long - term economic growth is taking a direct and destructive hit and its position of leadership in the world is seriously threatened			0
teachers : why do you teach ? so , yes , @entity2 's teachers are out on strike			1
that is today 's news , today 's headline			0
but the real problem is much larger			0
it is that power over this nation 's key educational decisions — in @entity2 and virtually everywhere else — is disproportionately exercised by special interests			1
long after @entity2 's teachers are back to work , this problem will remain			1
the fundamental challenge facing our country is to find some way of solving it .			0

@entity2 teachers are on strike for the first time in 25 years over contract disputes
@entity187 : collective bargaining is about teachers ' jobs , not children 's education
he says because of union rules , it 's very *difficult* to get *rid* of bad teachers
@entity187 : teachers unions have used their political power to weaken education reform
