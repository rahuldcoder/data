bad news , guys : the pangolin we adopted is missing			1
you may recall a vote i held online recently -- asking readers to suggest new names for pangolin @entity9 , who was released into a national park in @entity13 in march			1
the names you suggested were lovely : @entity14 , which is @entity16 for " shy " ; @entity17 , which is @entity13 for " protection			2
" and -- @entity19 , a scale - covered @entity21 character that even i 'll admit does bear a striking resemblance to a real - life panoglin			1
of course , since you 're the @entity26 , you voted up @entity19			2
so that 's @entity9 's new name			0
and now @entity19 is missing			1
i 'm not drawing any correlation between the two			0
of course not ... let me back up in case you have n't been following this story : pangolins are thought to be the most trafficked mammals in the world			0
they 're traded illegally and by the ton for their scales , which are used in traditional medicine and for their meat , which is a delicacy in @entity13 and @entity42			2
i recently spent some time investigating the pangolin trade in @entity44 as part of @entity46 's @entity48 project			1
one pangolin i met was named @entity9 -- and had been seized from the illegal trade and taken to the @entity51 and @entity52 in @entity13			1
he recently was released into @entity54			0
i thought it would be fun for @entity46 's audience to adopt and rename the pangolin , and the researchers who care for him kindly agreed			1
turns out , the researchers kind of like the name @entity19			1
" i guess it is kinda cute ( ish ) , " one wrote in an e-mail			0
" well , anything is better than @entity9 right ? ! " and they think it might help with his rescue			0
in a wednesday blog post , @entity73 , from the conservation program , wrote that @entity9 's ( sorry , @entity19 's ) radio tracking device had partially fallen off his tail			1
this happens quite a lot with this type of pangolin , she told me			2
the transmitting devices are fairly clunky , and they 're screwed into a scale that 's made of fingernail material			0
now , she is scouring the forest trying to find him			0
she 's set up " camera traps " that might snap a photo of the nocturnal animal if he 's roaming around at night , looking for ants			0
and she 's spending some time just wandering the park at night hoping to see him			0
" maybe if the voting by @entity46 readers is complete on deciding @entity98 s new name , i can see if whispering it as we walk through the forest on thursday night will be successful in coaxing him into view ! " she wrote			1
maybe ! i hope so			0
i sent her an e-mail telling her the new name for @entity9 is @entity19			2
i 'm holding out hope that @entity109 will find him by whispering " @entity112 " into the forest of @entity13			2
i kind of love imagining that scene , and wish her luck			0
if you want to follow her progress , and @entity19 's , check out her blog			2
and thanks to everyone who voted			0
one more favor to ask : maybe the fact that there 's a real - life endangered creature named after a video game character means @entity130 and @entity21 will start supporting pangolin conservation ? maybe someone can suggest that by starting a @entity135 petition ? so far , more than 4,000 people have signed a reader 's petition asking for @entity139 to put a pangolin in a movie			1
maybe there 's a similarly creative ask for @entity21 ? for more in this series , visit @entity46 / change .			1

@entity46 readers vote on the name " @entity19 " for a pangolin in @entity13
*sandshrew* the pangolin is missing ; researchers are searching for him
@entity19 is the name of a @entity21 character
@entity156 asks readers to try to get the company involved in pangolin conservation
