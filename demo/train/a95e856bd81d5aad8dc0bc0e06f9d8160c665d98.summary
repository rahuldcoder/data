-- the recent financial troubles in @entity2 have attracted a range of alarming headlines around the world , but we must be careful to avoid panic and reckless measures that would exacerbate the crisis			1
for in reality , @entity2 -- one of the smallest economies in the eurozone -- has a manageable fiscal deficit , low debt and until very recently a thriving economy , based on financial services and tourism			1
large reserves of natural gas and possibly oil have been discovered off its southern coast , which would bring a bonanza in three to five years			0
read more : why is @entity2 trying to tax bank deposits ? the roots of the crisis go back to 2006 when the @entity29 , the country 's second biggest bank was taken over by a smaller @entity31 bank			1
the new owners invested very heavily in @entity31 bonds and loans but kept it as a @entity2 bank , instead of transferring the hq to @entity31			1
this was because of the better corporate environment in @entity2 , where tax rates are just 10 % , compared to @entity31 where it is at least double that			2
three years ago the @entity42 also bought large quantities of @entity31 bonds , largely for reasons unconnected with their rate of return or risk , to help out @entity31			0
in 2011 , when a struggling @entity31 was allowed to let some of its private bond holders take a loss -- a " haircut " -- @entity2 banks lost money and needed refinancing			1
so the big financial institutions like the @entity42 and @entity29 asked for a bailout from the government , and the government came to the @entity60 in june 2012 saying it needed a bailout in turn			2

this would have seen a bank levy on all deposits over 100,000 euros in banks in @entity2 and a smaller percentage on deposits of more than 20,000 euros			2
the measure sparked fury in the @entity2 parliament , prompting @entity2 to withdraw money from bank cash machines and raising fears of a broader run on ailing banks			1
@entity83 , which has extensive business and banking ties to the tiny island , was angered by the move			2

but now their depositors are asked to pay for the high - risk strategies of other bankers			0
high - risk bankers risked their depositors ' money			0
but their depositors will not lose more than the depositors of other banks			0
this is the logic of the @entity2 " bailout " by the @entity105 , the @entity107 - led @entity106 and the @entity108			2
delinquent bankers ' losses are protected by prudent bankers ' gains			0
watch this : @entity2 mp : bailout plan wo n't work what is the justification ? it 's better than letting the two risk takers go bankrupt , the argument goes			2
that probably is the case			0
but then @entity31 banks and those of other nations in trouble were also bankrupt , and yet the same troika lend to them on better terms in order to avoid bankruptcy			0
@entity31 got 140 billion euros ; the haircut on @entity2 depositors will yield 5.8 billion			2
but @entity2 could not have the 5.8 billion out of @entity134 funds set up to rescue banks in trouble			1
deposits under 100,000 euros are insured in @entity134			2
yet , the terms of the euro group are so harsh , that the government of @entity2 could not raise the money without some haircut on the insured deposits			1
it is important to note that on tuesday the @entity2 parliament rejected a â ‚ ¬ 10 billion eurozone bailout package due to investor alarm over the proposed tax on existing bank deposits			0
however we do n't know what will come next			0
maybe the tax on the insured deposits will yield 2 billion euros			0
@entity154 said the euro group : we 'd prefer not to tax deposits under 100,000 euros but if you can not afford to raise the 5.8 billion in any other way , then you have no choice but to tax the small depositors			0
what does this tell us about the @entity134 project though ? is the eurozone a partnership of equals who care about each other 's subjects ? or is it a vehicle for scoring political points by the strong and powerful ? @entity83 's involvement with @entity2 as an offshore centre keeps coming up in these discussions			1
attracted by a corporate tax rate of 10 % -- half that of @entity83 's -- @entity83 have been investing money into @entity2 from the early 1990s			1
the money is then repatriated through investments in @entity83 ventures -- a legal way of reducing tax			1
@entity2 accepted an order last month by the @entity106 to allow an investigation into possible breaches of money - laundering rules , which is under way			1
but the euro group could not wait for the results before imposing the haircut ; not a single case of money laundering has been discovered so far			0
i have been involved both with central bank policy and with private banking in @entity2 for years ( and at different times ) and i have never come across anything non-compliant with @entity134 rules			1
the @entity83 make @entity2 's financial sector too large , it is claimed			1
but it is still not as large as @entity201 's , and not too different from those of other small nations with a highly educated labour force			0
and anyway , when a large system works well except for its involvement in a single and exceptional event like the @entity31 sovereign debt write - off , you do n't cut off half the system and destroy the sector , causing acute unemployment problems			0
you try to fix it , with better regulation of risk and other vulnerabilities			0
but then they shoot the horses , do n't they ? sooner or later such policies could backfire on @entity134			0
those of us who supported the @entity134 integration movement are disappointed .			1
