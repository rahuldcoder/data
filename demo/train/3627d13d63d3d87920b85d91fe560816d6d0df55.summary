" i did n't get it right			0
simply put , we have to do better , " @entity0 said during a news conference in @entity15 on friday			0
but what does that mean ? and how will the @entity1 carry that out ? here are five takeaways from @entity0 's news conference : 1			1
never considered resigning @entity0 and the @entity1 have been criticized and scrutinized over the handling of the @entity7 case by everybody from women 's rights groups to sponsors to the @entity28 administration			1

the classes are expected to begin within the next month , he said			0
however , @entity0 provided little detail about the education and training classes other than to say the league would include experts			2
conduct committee one of the chief steps being taken to address the league 's handling of domestic violence and sexual abuses cases is the creation of a committee to review the @entity1 's personal conduct policy			1
@entity0 said he hoped to have the committee in place by the time the @entity70 is played on february 2 , but he did not provide a timeline for the committee to make changes to the policy			1
the committee will include input from the @entity77 and experts in the prevention of domestic abuse and sexual assault			0
@entity0 did not say whether it would include law enforcement officials or mental health care professionals			0
what @entity7 said much of the criticism surrounding the @entity7 case has to do with how @entity0 and the league handled the case after learning in february that the running back had knocked out his then - fiancee , @entity90 , in an @entity92 , @entity93 , elevator and dragged her out			2
@entity0 suspended @entity7 without pay and fined him an additional game check for " conduct detrimental to the @entity1			1

" i 'm telling you right now it 's inconsistent with what he told us , " he said			0
but @entity0 declined to comment further on what the player told him , citing an ongoing appeal of @entity7 's suspension			1
reevaluating how @entity1 gathers information when asked why the league did not get a copy of the videotape during its initial investigation into the @entity7 case earlier this year , @entity0 said the league 's security department asked for it several times			1
" we got it with one phone call , " the @entity102 reporter told him , adding that the @entity1 has an entire department to investigate conduct issues			2
