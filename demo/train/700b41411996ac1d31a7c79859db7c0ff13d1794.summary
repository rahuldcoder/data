-- fancy stripping off before a flight and getting sweaty with fellow passengers ? @entity4 think you might like to and has backed the idea by adding a sauna to its new premium lounge in @entity9			1
airline lounges are prime ways for airlines to promote their brand and showcase all the luxury and service frills they can muster , but with a traditional unisex sauna , @entity4 has upped the ante			2
the airline has gone big on the @entity21 theme throughout the new lounge that opens later this year			0

" our aim was to create a high - quality , even emotional experience for @entity4 's demanding clients , " says designer @entity44			0
" different zones for work , refreshment , silence or bathing are unified with a light @entity56 design touch , creating a space that clients wo n't forget			0
" the sight of fellow passengers in the nude in a tiny room heated to nearly 100 degrees @entity63 could be part of that unforgettable experience , but perhaps not the kind of memory some would want to retain from a business trip			0
