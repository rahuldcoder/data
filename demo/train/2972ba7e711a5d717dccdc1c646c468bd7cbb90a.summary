@entity0 -- @entity2 could learn from former teen stars @entity4 and @entity5 how not to turn 20			1

the @entity0 district attorney is considering a vandalism charge against him , pending a sheriff 's investigation into an egg attack on a neighbor 's home			0
a good lawyer -- and @entity2 has plenty of those -- might resolve those cases without taking his freedom			1
@entity5 , whose offenses included two drunken driving convictions , and @entity4 , who pleaded guilty to beating girlfriend @entity43 , got probation , community labor and court - ordered counseling			1
probation gone bad a lesson for @entity2 might be that even if those first crimes do n't bring jail time , breaking probation rules can get you locked up			1
the best lawyer can only help a client to a point , especially if that client fails to report to a probation officer , does n't complete community service , tests positive for illegal drugs or gets arrested again			0

@entity5 's lesson for @entity2 @entity5 did well posing for @entity72 between court appearances , but her once - promising film career has been derailed by producers wary about her reliability			1
red carpet walks at movie premieres were replaced by dozens of walks into a courthouse			0
film critics can pan your work , but a judge can throw you in jail			0

she was late for a probation hearing once , then completely missed another court date			0
@entity5 was convicted of shoplifting a necklace			1
she angered a series of judges , resulting in dozens of court dates , several probation revocations , jail and rehab visits			1
@entity5 , who has publicly acknowledged her substance abuse struggle , appears to have finally found some balance in her life since completing treatment at the @entity104 rehab facility last year			2
she is still on probation			0
@entity4 's lesson for @entity2 @entity4 got glowing probation reports the first two years after he pleaded guilty to felony assault in august 2009			1
but @entity0 prosecutors began looking closer at his behavior after reports of a bar fight with @entity113 , a parking lot brawl with @entity115 and a hit - and - run arrest			0
investigators found evidence that @entity4 had fudged on completing the community labor requirement			2
@entity4 voluntarily entered a rehab program in late october , days after he was arrested on an assault charge in @entity122			2
his treatment ended abruptly when he was kicked out of the rehab program for throwing a rock through his mother 's car window in the middle of a family counseling session , according to a probation report			2
the judge soon revoked @entity4 's probation , but sent him back to rehab for 90 days instead of jail			1
@entity4 is now in a " dual diagnosis " rehab program for help with anger management and substance abuse			2
the latest probation report said he " is doing well in the program and making great strides " in rehab , although the prosecutor asked the judge to send him to jail because his violent outbursts were " increasing in severity and intensity			2
" the @entity122 assault charge is still pending			0
travel restrictions @entity4 has managed to put out new music and tour while on probation , but his legal troubles have dampened his success			1
when he wanted to tour @entity153 , he could n't			0
@entity155 border officials cited concerns that @entity4 might pose a danger to @entity155 citizens when they barred him from entering the @entity155 for concerts in 2010			2
" we reserve the right to refuse entry to the @entity155 to anyone guilty of a serious criminal offense , " said @entity160 , director of the @entity162 's international group			1
" public safety is one of our primary concerns			0
" a criminal record could threaten @entity2 's career even more , because he is a @entity172 citizen living and working in the @entity173 on a visa			1
while convictions might not result in his deportation , they could make crossing the border a problem			0
@entity2 , who has built a fortune by touring the world , has already gotten a taste of what could be			1
@entity185 agents delayed his entry into the @entity173 for several hours after his chartered jet landed in @entity189 's @entity188 from @entity28 last week			0
agents interviewed him for several hours before clearing him for entry			0
drug - sniffing dogs were used to search his plane , but no sign of drugs was detected and no illegal substances were found , according to a law enforcement source			0
a government statement to @entity1 noted that there are " more than 60 grounds of inadmissibility divided into several major categories , including health - related grounds , criminality , security reasons , public charge , labor certification , illegal entrants and immigration violations , documentation requirements , and miscellaneous grounds " that could keep someone out of the country			0
@entity1 legal analyst @entity214 said the evidence that @entity2 had @entity216 in his blood when he was arrested in @entity25 could be viewed as " drug abuse " by @entity173 border officials , if he did not have a prescription for the controlled substance			2
the threats to @entity2 's freedom and career are still only allegations			1
he has not been convicted of anything			0
