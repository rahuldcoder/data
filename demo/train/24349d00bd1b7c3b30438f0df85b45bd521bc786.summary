in @entity1 it 's known as gaokao -- the college entrance exams -- and for most young people it dictates the course of a life			1
a good score in the gaokao will open the doors to the country 's most prestigious universities , granting access not only to the best education and the chance to work overseas but also to an elite rolodex of upper - echelon contacts			1
@entity1 society , more than any other , is predicated on its networks , or guanxi , and grooming them is a lifetime 's work			1
for those that miss out on their gaokao , the years of tutoring and months of cramming could mean relegation to a provincial university and the oblivion of a major city " ant colony " -- the shared dormitory accommodation that awaits graduates trying to find work in @entity1 's urban centers			1
for others hoping to escape the ineluctable cycle of the gaokao , overseas study is only possible through a limited number of scholarships or rich parents			0
increasingly , however , @entity1 private schools -- with @entity48 a-level exams and the @entity49 -- are geared towards giving the children of the middle class the edge when it comes to gaining a place at a foreign university			1
" what we are talking about here really are the upper middle class and above -- people who are aware of what education systems are like in other parts of the world , " said @entity56 , professor of @entity1 at the @entity57 at the @entity58			1
heading abroad it 'd be hard to find another country over the past 10 years that has spent as much , and as furiously , as @entity1 on giving its next generation the kind of head start that an expensive international education provides			2
the number of @entity1 studying in the @entity77 has increased more than fourfold from about 60,000 in 2004 to more than 274,000 in 2014 , according to figures from the @entity79			1
@entity1 now accounts for almost a third of international students in the @entity77 , marking an historic high			1
while the @entity1 government assists students that want to study abroad , the majority of students are privately funded and education , in particular recently online education , is now part of a billion dollar industry			1
many education companies are publicly - listed companies and a new boom in online education is expected over the next three years , according to a report by @entity95			0
for the move towards private education in @entity1 not only reflects the aspirations of @entity1 's growing middle class but also a growing dissatisfaction with @entity1 's often tradition - bound curriculum			2
" people who are aware of what education systems are like in other parts of the world are becoming increasingly impatient with the @entity1 education system , " @entity56 said			2
" it has an enormous emphasis on rote learning , classes can spend ludicrous amounts of time repeating the same things again and again , it often does n't value creativity			0
" the elite are looking at other options and that includes sending their children to private schools in @entity1 and also sending them to @entity123 - speaking schools , in particular boarding schools in @entity48 which have a very good reputation in @entity1			2
" he said @entity1 teenagers who must sit the gaokao are required to put in very long hours of study			2
" i personally know 13 and 14 - year - olds in @entity1 who do not get more than four or five hours of sleep a day because of all the work that they need to do			0
i think many parents are worried because they 're not seeing it as a way of moving up in the world , " @entity56 said			0
@entity123 skills while the @entity1 system , with its emphasis on rote - learning , is good for certain subjects such as maths and the sciences , @entity56 said that the weighting on @entity123 in the gaokao -- and a shot at working and studying internationally -- still remained strong			1
last year , an attempt by the government to level the playing field by reducing the @entity123 - language section of the gaokao ( seen as a way of favoring students in provincial areas with fewer opportunities of gaining exposure to @entity123 ) has done little to dent @entity1 's rmb30 billion ( $ 5 billion ) @entity123 language industry			1
@entity123 language sections of the gaokao were reduced from 150 to 100 points while @entity1 sections were increased from 150 points to 180			0
even with some leading teaching companies charging as much as @entity165 , 000 a year for extra-curricular tuition , in a country where the average wage can be as low rmb13 , 000 a year , the @entity123 - teaching industry has only grown stronger , especially since the @entity169 in 2008			0
@entity170 , @entity1 's largest english - language tuition company , is listed on the @entity171 and has a market capitalization of $ 4.4 billion			2
@entity1 traditionally have a deep respect for education but increasingly the option of dropping out of the @entity1 education system altogether is becoming attractive to some			0
@entity178 , the rebel voice of @entity1 's post- 1980s generation , is @entity1 's most famous high school drop out and has gone on to parlay fame as a blogger and social commentator			0
" he became famous because when he was 18 he won a writing competition and won a free place at one of the best universities and he said no i 'm not interested , i do n't like this system and i just want to become an independent writer , " @entity56 said			0
