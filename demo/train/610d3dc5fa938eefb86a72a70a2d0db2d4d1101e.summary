-- two catchphrases have dominated stories about women in the election cycle this year : " the war on women " and " having it all			1
" it is time to change the conversation			2
women are the voters most likely to matter on november 6 -- they make up the majority of undecided voters and they outvote men			2
but to win women 's votes , @entity13 and president @entity14 must talk about what really matters to them			1
i know something about that from my students			0
the young women in my classes look to the future and want to know how to create workable lives for their families			2
they know about the pay gap			2
they know their earnings will matter to their families			0
they know their mothers are often starved for time			2
" how are we supposed to do it ? " they ask , over and over			0
we have not been giving them good answers			0
undoubtedly , the issues raised in claims about a " war on women " and the difficulty of " having it all " are important			1
but those arguments do n't fully address my students ' questions			0
in order for the candidates to speak directly to women , they need to talk about jobs , but not just any @entity53 matters are good jobs that make family lives sustainable			1
pay equity is the tip of the iceberg			1
consider this from the @entity60 : including all workers , the median full - time female worker earned $ 10,784 less in 2010 than the median full - time male worker			2
over a 40 - year career , that wage gap adds up to more than $ 400,000			0
this pay discrepancy affects the economic well - being of @entity69 households			0
women comprise two - thirds of @entity69 family breadwinners and co-breadwinners			1
inequality in pay means families have less money for quality child care , less education , fewer doctor visits and more scrambling to make ends meet , year in and year out			0
it 's not just households and family life that suffer			1
studies confirm that stretched workers mean lower productivity			0
but pay alone wo n't make the difference			0
all workers have family responsibilities			0
when women ask about fair pay , they are also asking about how to get jobs that make it possible to take a sick child to the doctor			1
they are asking about how to make sure fathers can get away from work early enough to make dinner , too			0
flexibility is a universal concern for @entity69 workers , not simply a women 's issue			1
as president @entity14 's @entity106 reported in 2009 , workplace flexibility increases productivity and reduces turnover and absenteeism			1
it 's good for the economy , and good for families			0
a @entity114 poll this month showed that women make up 54 % of the undecided voters and their no.1 concern is family well - being			1
contraception and reproductive rights , of course , matter a great deal to female voters			0
but if that 's the only issue the candidates talk about , they ignore the worries that women wake up to every morning as they hustle children through bowls of cereal and pile out the door to work			1
here is what the candidates can do : first , fight for the @entity135 , which would expand 1963 's @entity136 and make it easier for women to compare their pay with that of fellow workers			1
@entity135 was blocked this year in @entity142 ; it needs to be reintroduced			0
in our service economy , women still dominate in the lowest - paid jobs			1
because women 's pay has become more and more essential to their families , those historic inequities matter more and more			1
second , fight for workplace flexibility			1
family responsibilities burden all workers , men as well as women , regardless of pay			1
this is a social and economic reality that the nation must face			0
@entity69 needs leaders who will drag our workplaces out of the 1950s and into the 21st century			0
finally , support paid sick days nationwide			0
forty percent of the people in the work force do not have paid sick days , which puts them in danger of losing their jobs when they are sick ; millions more can not take sick days to care for their children			1
support for the @entity172 before @entity142 is critical			0
this legislation would grant workers up to seven job - protected paid sick days each year , to use not just when they are ill , but for helping sick family members and preventive care			2
there is still time , but not much , for me to tell my students that the candidates have some answers to their questions			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			2

@entity185 : time to go beyond catchphrases " war on women " and " having it all "
women 's votes are crucial for both candidates , she says , but they need to talk about jobs
*swinth* : women bring home all or a share of household income and family is top concern
she says pay equity , sick leave and workplace flexibility are priorities in the real world
