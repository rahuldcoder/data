-- like its trains , contract talks involving @entity2 remained at a standstill friday night -- with no plans for even a return to the negotiating table to resolve the system 's second strike in three months			1
the standoff left many of @entity13 and @entity15 's iconic bridges , streets and freeways clogged even more than usual during both the morning and evening rush hours on friday , the first day in which the nation 's fifth - largest train system has been shut down			2
@entity24 officials , at 5 p.m. ( 8 p.m. et ) , publicly detailed what they described as a new plan to end the strike			2
it includes returning to the previous contract language on all outstanding issues , according to negotiator @entity30			2
they also offered to bring in a mediator to address the points of contention -- which it says does not include the economic part of any deal , because it says that already has been agreed to -- but rather other issues			1
" these ( are ) real , genuine , thoughtfully written ... steps that will settle all disputes on the table , " said @entity40 , president of the local @entity24			2
" ... it 's not we win or they lose , but the trains ( would be ) running			2
" @entity2 management quickly dismissed the proposal " as simply a repeat " of a previous " unacceptable " offer , said spokesman @entity52			1
@entity2 is open to mediation , but only if it 's on the whole package rather than " cherry - picking the parts they like and leaving behind the parts they do n't like			1
" " we 're calling on union leaders to return to the bargaining table that continues ( to address ) all of the issues as a whole , " @entity59 said			1
@entity2 , whose system normally serves 26 communities including @entity15 and @entity13 , has chartered buses during the strike for highly limited but free rush - hour service			1
buses departed certain stations in the morning directly for @entity15 , then carried passengers back to those stations in the afternoon			0
that was expected to help about 6,000 passengers in each direction , according to @entity2			1
still , that 's just a fraction of the roughly 400,000 people who use the service daily			1
and for some of them -- like those behind a petition to ban @entity2 strikes , as is done for other transit systems around the nation -- patience is running thin			1
" i think the public would have such bad blood this time around for both @entity2 and the unions , " @entity2 rider @entity90 , 53 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity91 before trains stopped earlier this week			2
@entity2 and workers ' unions have been negotiating a new contract for months			1
@entity24 leaders said the latest strike was called because management made a late push to change worker rules , the framework governing issues such as how work is assigned and what shifts people can work			1
this came after the unions made concessions to reach an " economic framework agreement " -- after six months of talks -- on wages , pensions and health care , @entity116 , a local executive director of the @entity24 , said friday			0
" basically what management did was produce , in essence , a poison pill , saying , ' @entity119 , we made this amazing progress after six months , we have an economic framework agreement			0
but wait , there 's more			0
you must take this now , ' " @entity116 said			0
" at that point ... the negotiations broke down			0
" @entity2 objected to that characterization in a couple of ways			2
first , the sides have n't agreed on wages , @entity2 spokesman @entity134 said			1
" we 're still at a 12 % pay increase over four years ( at 3 % per year ) , " he said			0
" the union 's last proposal was higher than that			1
" second , @entity134 said , changes to worker rules -- such as ditching a regulation that requires communicating with handwritten notes and faxing in favor of using more modern technology -- have " been in our package since april 1			0
" " how they can think this is a surprise is simply not credible , " he said			0
@entity116 said he wants @entity2 to agree to arbitration on the worker rules , but not on the economic issues , which he considered all but set			1
@entity134 , though , said that was unacceptable			0
" we ca n't split the package apart , " he said			0
" we ca n't take one part of this -- the work rules -- to arbitration ( and ) leave the rest of it on the table to negotiate			0
" @entity2 said earlier this week that its " best and final proposal " included the wage raises as well as increases in pensions and medical coverage			2
the @entity2 board would take the whole package -- " because we do not have agreement on the salary increases , " she said -- to binding arbitration			2
the unions seek " 20 % plus salary increases , " she said			0
" the issues that remain unresolved are not minor			0
we can not get tired and give up			0
they get to the heart of @entity2 's need to function efficiently and economically , " the @entity2 general manager said			1
@entity116 apologized to the area 's commuters			0
" we 're very sorry			0
we understand that this strike -- what it does to the @entity2 riders , and we understand that it is a hardship			1
... we apologize , " he said			0
" we urge the public to contact the @entity2 district and tell them to finish negotiating a fair deal with our union			1
" @entity2 workers also went on strike in the summer , paralyzing the @entity15 regional transportation system for four days in july			1
@entity0 's @entity196 and @entity197 contributed to this report .			0
