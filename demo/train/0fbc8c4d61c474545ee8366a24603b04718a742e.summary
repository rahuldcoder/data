@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 foreign minister @entity3 on tuesday ruled out holding a second international meeting in a bid to defuse the crisis in @entity1 , also saying it would be " unusual " to hold a presidential election in the country when the army was being deployed against the population			1
in what could be a sign of @entity15 preparing to question the legitimacy of the may 25 presidential election if it is unhappy with the process , @entity3 said , " in the situation where they use the army against their own population , it 's quite unusual			1
" " this is not @entity29 ; this is a completely different situation , " he said , adding that constitutional reforms promised by @entity26 's new leaders would not be implemented in time for the vote			2
@entity26 's security forces have launched their biggest effort yet to dislodge the @entity34 militants who have overrun the south and east of the country , reportedly seizing buildings in dozens of towns and cities			1
both sides clashed at the rebel stronghold of @entity0 on monday			0
@entity1 's security services said 30 " heavily armed " militants had been killed in recent days as part of the " anti-terrorist " operation in the volatile region			1
the rising tensions could have an impact far beyond @entity1 's borders , @entity49 secretary general @entity48 warned on tuesday			1
" today we are facing the gravest crisis to @entity57 security since the end of the @entity59 , " he told reporters			1
" but this is not just about @entity1			2
this crisis has serious implications for the security and stability of the @entity67 - @entity66 area as a whole			2

he also called for @entity34 sympathizers to be involved in talks			0
" we already discussed the framework of the possible actions of stabilizing @entity1			2
there 's no point doing it again , " he said			0
" of course , it is possible , but we will walk in circles , and we will repeat the same things , and we will say again and again that we have to stick to the decisions which were already made -- but it 's up to the @entity1 to realize that it 's their country , that they have to live in peace between themselves			1
" @entity3 was speaking after a meeting of the @entity95 in the @entity97 capital of @entity98 , where the @entity1 crisis dominated talks , even though diplomatic efforts have done little to ease the situation			1
his words came as violence escalated , with @entity1 's military seeking to regain control of swaths of the country that @entity34 militia groups have seized			1
@entity26 and many in the @entity111 believe that the separatists are backed by @entity15 and fear that @entity4 president @entity113 is fomenting trouble to increase his influence in the region			2
earlier , in remarks to reporters in @entity98 , @entity118 foreign secretary @entity117 accused @entity4 of seeking to undermine @entity1 's presidential elections			1
" @entity4 seems to be intent on a course of preventing and disrupting those elections , " he said			2
" that is wrong , and i think there will be a very strong message from the great majority of countries here today that the @entity1 elections must be allowed to go ahead			2
" @entity117 said the doors to a diplomatic solution remain open			0

" otherwise , there will be chaos and civil war			0
@entity113 wishes today that this election does not take place			0
" @entity165 @entity167 @entity166 voiced concern about the escalating violence tuesday and urged all sides to do more to find a peaceful solution to the crisis			0
