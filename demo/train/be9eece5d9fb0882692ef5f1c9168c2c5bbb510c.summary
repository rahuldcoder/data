-- they say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self - loathing			1
but not for these folks ! long before the @entity7 ordered papa to stop preaching , these six puffed - up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose			1
@entity10 did n't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors			2
here 's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form			1
@entity10 @entity10 was , without question , one of the towering geniuses of cinema			2
and , like many greats , he was n't exactly the best collaborator			2
@entity10 was particularly trying for screenwriters , who felt he never properly credited them for their work			2
but he was notoriously hard on actors			2
he was once quoted as saying , " actors are cattle " -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry ( actors can be so touchy )			2
in response , he issued this correction : " i have been misquoted			2
what i really said is , ' actors should be treated as cattle			2
' " although it began accidentally ( when he was short an actor for the film " @entity38 " ) , @entity10 soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films , amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career			2
@entity45 the egotist 's egotist , author @entity45 ( born @entity45 ) is the patron saint of thinking you 're @entity49			1
her most famous novels , @entity50 and @entity51 , are massive dramatizations of @entity54 , her self - spun @entity55 - the - @entity57 philosophy for success			2
objectivism champions ego and accomplishment , shuns all religion as folly , and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society			2
@entity45 's novels often focus on protagonists ( invariably men ) who are shunned by others because of their genius , but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant			1
not surprisingly , she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as " spitting in your own face			1
" so , just how much did @entity45 believe in her own philosophy ? let 's just say a lot			1
with signature modesty , she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of @entity87 and @entity88			0
@entity89 when you create a cinematic masterpiece such as " @entity92 " at the ripe old age of 25 , you 're bound to get a big head			0
but @entity89 was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that			0
in fact , " @entity92 " might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego			0
after all , it 's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul @entity104 because @entity104 slighted @entity89 at a dinner party			1
of course , after the unparalleled success of " @entity92 , " @entity89 's arrogant side did n't get any less subtle			1
do yourself a favor : track down a recording of @entity89 ' outtakes for a tv commercial for frozen peas			0
you 'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker 's oversized ego			1
a classic quote goes : " in the depths of your ignorance , what is it you want ? " @entity121 as the brains behind the @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , the @entity126 , and countless other design benchmarks , @entity121 is arguably the genius of 20th - century architecture			1
and , boy , did he know it ! @entity121 was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals			1
in fact , the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him			0
but when you 're @entity121 , you 're right			1
in 1935 , department store magnate @entity139 ( of @entity141 fame ) commissioned the architect to design his @entity144 home , but the project quickly went sour			1
@entity121 's avant - garde floor plan included " sleeping porches " that required his client to sleep outdoors year - round			1
in addition , @entity139 ' small bedroom " cubicles " came equipped with almost no closet space			0
when @entity139 respectfully explained that ( a ) temperatures during summer nights in @entity144 often exceed 80 degrees and ( b ) a high - fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets , @entity121 threw a series of tantrums			1
fortunately for the voyeur in us all , said tantrums usually took place in letter form			0
preserved and occasionally displayed at the @entity167 , they make for delicious reading			0
@entity169 " every morning when i awake , the greatest of joys is mine : that of being @entity169			1
" yup , he actually said that			0
everything about the legendary @entity178 painter ( he of the melting clocks ) -- from his whacked - out paintings to his curled - up mustache -- was designed to shock , destroy convention , cause scandal , and stir controversy			0
criticized for choosing to live under @entity186 's fascist government in @entity187 , @entity169 defended his position by stating that he did n't care about others so long as he could be king			1
not exactly a man of the people			0
if he was n't getting enough attention , he was known to walk the streets of @entity194 clanging a hand bell			0
of course , this is also the guy who once said , " the thought of not being recognized [ is ] unbearable			0
" need another telling quote ? " at the age of 6 years , i wanted to be a chef			1
at the age of 7 , i wanted to be @entity204			1
my ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since			1
" apparently , so did his ego			0
@entity209 plenty of performers this side of @entity213 have been labeled " the world 's greatest entertainer			1
" but @entity209 really , really believed it			0
the vaudeville singer , actor , dancer , and comedian was born @entity209 in @entity221 , @entity222 , in what was then part of @entity225			0
as a performer , he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows , ad - libbing , or just stopping to talk to the audience			0
during a 1911 performance of the critically hated " @entity240 is a @entity236 " ( title not edited for political correctness ) , @entity209 stopped and asked the audience if they 'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play			0
the crowd roared with applause , and @entity209 ditched the whole program and took over			0
from that moment on , no one else could share the stage with him			0
unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list , however , @entity209 can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance			0
according to most contemporary accounts , he actually was the greatest in the world			0
but , despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen , @entity209 's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface ( considered highly offensive now , but pretty common at the time )			1
