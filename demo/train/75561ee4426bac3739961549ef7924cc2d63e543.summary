-- " i wo n't even sleep in the same room with them			0
" a fellow named @entity5 was telling me his hard - and - fast rule for getting through the night			1
he takes all of his digital devices -- laptops , tablets , cellphones , anything portable that has a screen -- to another room before he turns off the light			1
he has come to terms with the fact that the technological gadgets that have so thoroughly insinuated themselves into our lives can become addictive			2
so , when it 's time for slumber , he locks them out			0
he wo n't even let his cellphone charge overnight in the bedroom : " if it 's there , i would have the temptation to turn it on and check it			0
" we have learned to celebrate , even revere , the wireless gadgets we carry around and the inventors who bring them to us ; the response to the death of @entity34 this month was emblematic of how important our do - it - all phones , our computers , our tablets and related digital devices have become			1
we say that the technology has changed life as we used to know it			0
but how much is too much ? and , more to the point : how many of us have the nagging feeling that we are somehow unable to disconnect -- that the electronic devices we own have begun to own us ? there is an instinct to treat the subject whimsically : " @entity50 , @entity51 , those kids are walking down the street staring at their cellphone screens			2
" it 's as if any criticism of what the digital age has done to society brands the person raising the questions as backward , afraid of change , irrationally wedded to outmoded ways			1
so the addiction question is often one that people silently ask themselves			2
should n't we be spending less time checking and rechecking our many screens , large and small , and more time taking part in what used to be regarded as real life ? is there something inherently wrong when people being separated from their phones , computers and tablets makes them feel nervous , irritable , tense -- in other words , when they begin to exhibit classic withdrawal symptoms ? for guidance on this , i got in touch with @entity5 , who has given as much thought to the subject as anyone of whom i 'm aware			1
a former @entity0 correspondent , he is a lecturer , writer and broadcaster on technology issues who , in his own life , became increasingly conscious of the unhealthy hold that digital devices can have			1
he wrote a book called " the @entity96 " that argues persuasively that there can come a time in a person 's life when he or she is a good candidate for technology detox			2
i asked him if " addiction " is too strong a word to use in relation to devices that seem to hook their users emotionally , but not chemically			2
" unfortunately , the word ' addiction ' has become overused , " he said , and should not be trivialized			0
addictions to illegal drugs , alcohol and prescription medication are grimly somber matters			0
but , he said , the idea of an addiction to digital devices is genuine and is not something that should be greeted with a sardonic wink			1
" one definition of ' addiction ' is when other people and other activities in your life begin to suffer because of something you know you should cut back on , but do n't , " he said			0
some of his examples are things that many people will instantly recognize : -- the urge to pull out a cellphone even when someone you 're with is in the midst of a conversation with you			1
-- texting even while your child is telling you about his or her day at school , and realizing later that you ca n't remember the details of what your son or daughter has said to you			0
-- having the vague feeling that something has n't really happened until you post it to @entity148 or @entity149			0
-- feeling isolated and anxious if you are offline for an extended period of time			0
-- noticing that even when your family is all together in one room at home , each person is gazing at his or her own screen and tapping at a miniature keyboard			0
" there are people who , even when they are n't using their digital devices , find themselves creating status updates or @entity149 feeds in their heads while they are experiencing things , " he said			1
" it 's as if they have lost the ability to live in the moment , and have become conditioned to feeling that they have to instantly share it electronically while it is still going on			0
" @entity5 is hardly a guy stuck in some dust - covered , pre-technology past : he has always been among the first to own each new portable device , and he likes the many good things the digital experience can provide			1
but he realized -- when his wife would wake up in the middle of the night to see him , in bed , illuminated by the glow of one screen or another that he had decided to check one more time before he fell back asleep -- that something might need remedying			0
there is , he said , a feeling common among people who are digitally hooked that , when it 's just them and the real world and no screen , they are somehow cast adrift , cut off : " it 's a sense of , ' what am i missing ? ' " but in truth , a strong case can be made that when a person lives too many hours a day in the digital universe , that is when he or she is really missing something -- missing the things that are taking place in the flesh - and - blood world			1
@entity5 has a phrase for it : you know you 're in trouble when " your footing in technology feels increasingly like quicksand			1
" and he has a piece of advice for all of us , regardless of how deep we feel we 're sinking into that digital quicksand : like him , we should consider locking all of those devices in another room at night			1
he promises that it makes a difference : " you sleep better			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			2

@entity219 : people are increasingly wedded to smart phones , other digital devices
he says author @entity5 *suggests* ways to avoid becoming addicted to gadgets
one sign of trouble is pulling out your phone in the midst of an in - person conversation
people constantly tied to devices may be missing the world around them , @entity219 says
