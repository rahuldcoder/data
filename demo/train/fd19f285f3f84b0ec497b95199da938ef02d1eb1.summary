-- gov. @entity1 of @entity2 delivered the @entity4 response to president @entity6 's @entity5 on wednesday night			1
here is a transcript of the speech			2
@entity1 : thank you very much			1
eleven days ago , i was honored to be sworn in as the 71st governor of @entity2			1
i 'm standing in the historic @entity13 of @entity2 's @entity14 , a building designed by @entity2 's second governor , @entity16			1
it 's not easy to follow the president of the @entity19			1
and my 18 - year - old twin boys have added pressure to me tonight by giving me exactly 10 minutes to finish before they leave to go watch " sportscenter			0
" ( @entity23 ) i 'm joined by fellow @entity24 to share a @entity4 perspective on how to best address the challenges facing our nation today			1
we were encouraged to hear president @entity6 speak this evening about the need to create jobs			1
all @entity19 should have the opportunity to find and keep meaningful work , and the dignity that comes with it			1
( @entity36 ) many -- many of us here tonight -- and many of you watching -- have family or friends who have lost their jobs			0
in fact , 1 in 10 @entity19 is unemployed			1
here in @entity2 , we 've faced our highest unemployment rate in more than 25 years , and bringing new jobs and more opportunities to our citizens is the top priority of my administration			1
good government policy should spur economic growth and strengthen the private sector 's ability to create new jobs			1
( @entity36 ) we must enact policies that promote entrepreneurship and innovation so @entity19 can better compete with the world			1
what government should not do is pile on more taxation , regulation and litigation that kill jobs and hurt the middle class			2
it was @entity16 who called for " a wise and frugal government which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned			2
today , the federal government is simply trying to do too much			2
last year , we were told that massive new federal spending would create more jobs immediately and hold unemployment below 8 percent			0
in the past year , more than 3 million people have lost their jobs , and yet the @entity83 continues deficit spending , adding to the bureaucracy , and increasing the national debt on our children and our grandchildren			0
the amount of debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10			0
the federal debt is now over $ 100,000 per household			0
the president 's partial freeze announced tonight on discretionary spending is a laudable step , but a small one			2
the circumstances of our time demand that we reconsider and restore the proper limited role of government at every level			2
( @entity36 ) without reform , the excessive growth of government threatens our very liberty and our prosperity			2
in recent months , the @entity19 people have made clear that they want government leaders to listen and then act on the issues most important to them			1
we want results , not rhetoric			0
we want cooperation , not partisanship			0
( @entity36 ) there is much common ground			0
all @entity19 agree that we need health -- health care system that is affordable , accessible , and high quality			1
but most @entity19 do not want to turn over the best medical care system in the world to the federal government			1
republicans in @entity83 have offered legislation to reform health care , without shifting @entity128 costs to the states , without cutting @entity130 , and without raising your taxes			1
and we will do that by implementing common sense reforms , like letting families and businesses buy health insurance policies across state lines and ending frivolous lawsuits against doctors and hospitals that drive up the cost of your health care			1
and our solutions are n't 1,000 - page bills that no one has fully read , after being crafted behind closed doors with special interests			2
in fact , many of our proposals are available online at solutions.gop.gov , and we welcome your ideas on @entity157 and @entity158			0
( @entity23 ) all @entity19 agree that this nation must become more energy independent and secure			1
we are blessed here in @entity19 with vast natural resources , and we must use them all			1
advances in technology can unleash more natural gas , nuclear , wind , coal , alternative energy that will lower your utility bills			0
here in @entity2 , we have the opportunity to become the first state on the @entity173 to explore for and produce oil and natural gas off - shore			1
( @entity36 ) but this administration 's policies are delaying off - shore production , hindering nuclear energy expansion , and seeking to impose job - killing cap - and - trade energy taxes			2
now is the time to adopt innovative energy policies that create jobs and lower energy prices			0
( @entity36 ) all @entity19 agree that a young person needs a world - class education to compete in the global economy			1
as a young kid , my dad told me , " son , if you want a good job , you need a good education			0
" @entity195 was right , and that 's even more true today			2
the president and i agree on expanding the number of high - quality charter schools and rewarding teachers for excellent performance			0
more school choices for parents and students mean more accountability and greater achievement			0
a child 's educational opportunity should be determined by her intellect and work ethic , not by her zip code			0
( @entity36 ) all @entity19 agree that we must maintain a strong national defense			1
the courage and success of our armed forces is allowing us to draw down troop levels in @entity218 as that government is increasingly able to step up			0
my oldest daughter , @entity220 , was an @entity222 platoon leader in @entity218 , so i am personally grateful for the service and sacrifice of all our men and women in uniform , and a grateful nation thanks them			0
( @entity36 ) we applaud president @entity6 's decision to deploy 30,000 more troops to @entity232			1
we agree that victory there is imperative for national security			0
but we have serious concerns over the recent steps the administration has taken regarding suspected terrorists			0
@entity19 were shocked on christmas day to learn of the attempted bombing of a flight to @entity242			1
this foreign terror suspect was given the same legal rights as a @entity19 citizen and immediately stopped providing critical intelligence			1
as sen. - elect @entity247 has said , we should be spending taxpayer dollars to defeat terrorists , not to protect them			0
( @entity36 ) here at home , government must help foster a society in which all our people can use their @entity255 - given talents and liberty to pursue the great @entity19 dream			1
@entity4 know that government can not guarantee individual outcomes , but we strongly believe that it must guarantee equality of opportunity for all			1
that opportunity exists best in a democracy which promotes free enterprise , economic growth , strong families , and individual achievement			0
many @entity19 are concerned about this administration 's effort to exert greater control over car companies , banks , energy , and health care , but over-regulating employers wo n't create more employment , overtaxing investors wo n't foster more investment			1
top - down , one - size - fits - all decision - making should not replace the personal choices of free people in a free market , nor undermine the proper role of state and local governments in our system of federalism			0
as our founders clearly stated , and we governors clearly understand , government closest to the people governs best			0
( @entity36 ) and no government program can ever replace the actions of caring @entity19 freely choosing to help one another			1
the scriptures say , " to whom much is given , much will be required			0
" as the most generous and prosperous nation on @entity299 , it is heartwarming to see @entity19 giving much time and money to the people of @entity303			2
thank you for your ongoing compassion			0
( @entity36 ) some people say they 're afraid that @entity19 is no longer the great land of promise that she has always been			2
@entity19 will always blaze the trail of opportunity and prosperity			2
@entity19 will -- must always be a land where liberty and property are valued and respected and innocent human life is protected			2
government should have this clear goal : where opportunity is absent , we must create it			0
where opportunity is limited , we must expand it			0
where opportunity is unequal , we must make it open to everyone			0
( @entity36 ) our founders pledged their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honor to create this great nation			0
now we should pledge as @entity330 , @entity4 and independents -- @entity19 all -- to work together to leave this nation an ever better place than we found it			1
@entity255 bless you , and @entity255 bless this great land of @entity19			2
thank you very much .			0
