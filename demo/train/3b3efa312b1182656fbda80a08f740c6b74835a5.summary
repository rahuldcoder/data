@entity0 -- in @entity4 , the " you can see @entity9 from here " state , state rep. @entity2 is more concerned about what the @entity6 government can see			1
@entity2 , a conservative @entity11 , this week is appearing in an unusual television ad warning travelers that new full - body scanners at @entity4 airports will enable airport screeners to " see through your clothes , " and advising passengers they can instead opt for a pat - down			1
" if you do n't want inappropriate pictures of you or your children taken and stored , or if you 're concerned about the possible health effects , then all you 've got to say is ' i opt out			2
' it is your right , " @entity2 says , standing in front of the state seal			1
" instead they will pat you down , and if they touch you inappropriately , call the airport police			2
this is still a free country , " he says in the 30 - second spot			0
watch the spot on @entity33 @entity2 told @entity1 he is concerned about both the privacy and health impacts of the full - body imagers , and about the government 's slow encroachment on people 's constitutional rights			1
" there 's fear that some of these pictures are going to be distributed on the @entity45 , " he said			0
but the @entity46 says the ad is flawed on several accounts			2
the body imagers now installed in @entity50 , and soon to be installed at three other @entity4 airports , all use software that displays a generic body outline to protect people 's privacy			1
all use harmless radio waves instead of low - level radiation			0
and none record images , said @entity46 spokesman @entity61			1
" as we have said all along , our machines in airports do not have the ability to and will not ever save images , " @entity61 said			2
@entity2 , a second - term state representative , videotaped his ad last week , placed it on @entity33 , and is spending $ 2,060 in leftover campaign money to air it on television newscasts this week			1
the audience has been receptive , he said			0
fellow state legislators and a schoolteacher called " congratulating me and thanking me , " he said			0
told of the @entity46 's statement that the imagers in @entity4 use harmless radio waves and display only a generic body outline , @entity2 called it " good news , " but said his concerns remain because @entity4 also travel out of the state , where the older body scanners are in use			1
" that 's great that they 're using that ( privacy ) technology up here in @entity4 , but people are still traveling out of state , and it 's the return flights that they need to be aware of , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's really the process that 's really unnerving , " he said			2
" you have people holding their arms out like they 're criminals and being treated like criminals			0
and it 's the whole psychological effect that we 're imposing on society , and instilling fear and ... breeding suspicion of one another			0
" @entity2 said he created the announcement to alert travelers that they can refuse to stand in front of the imager , and opt for a pat - down instead			1
most travelers do not know they have that option , he said			0
indeed , a federal appeals court in july said " many passengers ... remain unaware of this right ( to opt for a pat - down ) , and some who have exercised the right have complained that the resulting pat - down was unnecessarily aggressive			1
" the @entity118 has a history of bucking the @entity46			2
earlier this year , state rep. @entity120 , a breast cancer survivor , famously chose to catch a small plane from @entity122 to @entity123 and ride a ferry to @entity125 rather then submit to either the full - body imager or the pat - down			1
after that incident , the state legislature overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling on the @entity46 to reconsider its use of pat - down searches and urging the @entity133 to " exercise greater oversight " of the @entity46			1
" here in @entity4 , it 's really import for @entity4 residents to have the ability to fly , " @entity2 said			1
" you ca n't go to the doctor without flying			0
you ca n't leave your village without flying			0
in some cases children go to school with flying			0
" " i get a little upset with people accusing me , or being suspicious of me , as a citizen trying to travel , " @entity2 said			2
@entity2 said when he travels , he asks for a private pat - down to prevent bystanders with camera - phones from taking his photo being patted down			1
" i do n't want people thinking of @entity2 as a criminal with my hands in the air being frisked by someone with a badge and a uniform			2
that 's not the image i want to put out , " he said			0
the @entity46 did not comment directly on @entity2 's ad			1
but it defended its screening practices			0
" while there 's no silver bullet , imaging technology is a valuable tool to detect potential threat items concealed on passengers , " spokesman @entity61 said in a statement			0
" we routinely find prohibited or illegal items on passengers , which illustrates our ability to detect threats concealed under clothing -- such as explosives			0
â € ªâ € @entity180 use of imaging technology has led to the discovery of more than 300 dangerous or illegal items hidden on passengers			0

state representative warns travelers about full - body scanners at airports
*democrat* @entity2 *reminds* @entity4 they can opt for a pat - down
the @entity46 denies the scans *violate* travelers ' privacy or that images are stored
" it 's really the process that 's unnerving , " @entity2 says
