@entity0 -- in may , i experienced what 's known as a " failure to deliver			2
" then again last week , it was " failure to deliver			2
" the first fail was a maddening experience with @entity8 , the next a worse experience with @entity10			2
these occurred after i relocated to a flat , and discovered the pain of not having a front porch , plant pot or friendly neighbor			0
how do you apartment dwellers handle this ? thankfully i bullied @entity8 into a saturday morning delivery at no charge , and @entity10 reprinted the book i ordered and delivered to my office			0
but many companies ban personal deliveries -- and this is where what 's being called " click and collect " comes in			1
click and collect allows shoppers to pick up their shopping when and where it suits -- and @entity31 are leading the way			1
according to @entity33 , 35 % of @entity31 who shop online click to buy , then have the goods delivered to a location that suits			1
only 5 % of @entity37 and 13 % of @entity38 do the same			0
when consumers first started online shopping , the collecting was n't expected to be harder than the clicking			1
" even five years ago , the concept of ordering something online and then having to collect it at a store seemed ludicrous , " @entity43 of @entity33 told me			1
" it takes the whole concept of convenience out of online shopping			1
" but by 2017 , according to @entity43 , the number of @entity31 collecting after clicking will soar to 70 %			1
companies including @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 are capturing this trend , as are newcomers such as @entity62			2
in a joint venture with @entity64 , @entity62 is using the rail stations ' extra space as delivery shops , which will be open between 6:00am and 9:00pm seven days a week			1
this will allow millions of commuters to collect and -- maybe more importantly -- return products bought online			1
" most of the people who travel by rail , to big cities , are n't at home during the day , " @entity71 , ceo of @entity72 told me			0
" they have that ' sorry you were out ' card when they get home			0
there is a big opportunity to fill that gap			0
" @entity86 will soon allow its online shops to deliver goods through the thousands of @entity56 outlets			2
the @entity90 also plans to deliver to small independent stores , some of whom have joined the delivery networks @entity57 or @entity58			0
@entity62 is touting a twist though			2
@entity71 says 40 % of clothing bought online is returned			1
many of the 300 @entity99 stores planned around rail stations will have changing rooms			0
" you do n't actually have to take the goods home			0
you can try it on here and send it straight back			0
" no more calling in sick , waiting for that new purchase to arrive .			0

" click and collect " is becoming an *increasingly* *popular* way to collect good bought online
more than a third of @entity31 use click and collect , far more than their @entity113 peers
newcomer @entity62 is now *partnering* with @entity64 to provide shopping pick - up spots
