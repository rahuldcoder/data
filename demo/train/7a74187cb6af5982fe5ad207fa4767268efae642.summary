-- four women were detained by traffic police in two @entity4 cities this week for defying the @entity6 's driving ban , according to all the women stopped			1
in the @entity9 port city of @entity10 thursday , two women , @entity12 and @entity13 , were stopped by police after being spotted in a car on one of the city 's main thoroughfares			1
@entity13 , who 's been an avid supporter of a two - month - old campaign seeking to gain the right to drive for women in @entity4 , told @entity0 she and @entity23 were hoping to get caught			1
" we did go driving on a main street where we know there 's a lot of traffic police , " explained @entity13 , who was in the passenger seat			2
" we 're just trying to push and see how far can we go with this , " said @entity13 , " because two women yesterday were caught by police and detained for 10 hours			1
today , in a different city it was totally different			0
we were caught and stopped for only two hours			0
" the woman who drove the car , @entity23 , told @entity0 she was so convinced she and @entity13 would spend the night in jail , she even packed a toothbrush , some shampoo and an extra set of clothing			0
for @entity13 , an author and columnist who 's driven herself around @entity10 five times now , getting behind the wheel is no longer enough in an extraordinary campaign of civil disobedience that has seen dozens of women taking to the streets since october			1
" we 're asking girls in different regions to go out , " she said , " because we 're trying to see if police in different regions react differently to cases of women driving			2
" according to @entity23 and @entity13 , the traffic police officer who pulled them over was very kind to them and even supportive of their cause			2
they said he told them that due to protocol , he had to call for backup , and they were soon surrounded by several more police cars			0
in the end , @entity23 had to sign a pledge not to drive again in the presence of a male relative before the women could be released			0
one day earlier in the country 's capital , @entity74 , which is in a far more conservative part of the country , two other women described a far more difficult experience after being caught driving			1
@entity78 and @entity79 told @entity0 they were detained at a @entity74 police station for more than 10 hours after being caught and pulled over by traffic police			1
@entity82 , who was driving , said when they first started driving down one of @entity74 's main streets , many male drivers around them were giving them signs of support			1
half an hour later , after a traffic police officer spotted them , they were pulled over			0
" we were then surrounded by six cop cars , and the people who stopped us were quite rude , " said @entity82			0
according to @entity99 , despite the fact that her husband came to the police station shortly after she was taken there , it still took at least eight more hours before she was released into his custody			2
@entity79 explained they were not looking to attract the police 's attention , just simply doing what they should be able to do			0
" freedom of movement is a right , " said @entity79 , a human rights activist			0
" this is a right for women here			0
there 's no law that bars women from driving in @entity4 , and i hope more women will go out and drive			1
" despite repeated attempts , @entity0 was unable to reach @entity4 's @entity117 for comment			2
the issue of women driving is a particularly sensitive and controversial one in @entity4 , the last country on @entity121 where females do n't have that right			1
in recent years , though , more women have challenged the government , urging officials to overturn the ban and taking to streets in remarkable displays of civil disobedience			0
although women are not allowed to drive in the ultraconservative kingdom , there is , in fact , no law barring them from doing so			0
but religious edicts are often interpreted to enforce the prohibition			0
in may 2011 , @entity138 was jailed for more than a week after posting a video of herself driving in @entity4 online			2
she quickly became a hero to many and inspired dozens of women to drive throughout the streets of various cities in june of that year			0
more recently , in september , a website for the october 26 women 's @entity146 launched , and within a few weeks , tens of thousands had signed an online petition calling for an end to the driving ban for women in @entity4			1
as october 26 approached , numerous women filmed themselves driving in the @entity6 and uploaded those clips to sites like @entity155			1
in the weeks leading up to october 26 , one @entity4 cleric gave an interview in which he warned that @entity4 women who drove risked damaging their ovaries			2
on october 24 , the country 's @entity117 issued a statement telling women to stay off the streets			0
despite strong opposition by conservative quarters in the @entity6 , where a puritanical strain of @entity167 is practiced , october 26 saw dozens of women taking to the streets and driving			1
the campaign 's backers insist the movement is ongoing and has been a success thus far , while its critics say it has failed			0
in early december , two of @entity4 's best - known female advocates for lifting the ban on women driving were also detained after being caught behind the wheel in the country 's capital			1
@entity183 , who was driving the car , and her passenger , @entity185 , told @entity0 they were pulled over and spent a few hours at a police station in @entity74 until being released into the custody of their respective husbands .			1

two pairs of @entity4 female drivers detained : one in @entity10 , the other in @entity74
the women in @entity10 say the police were kind and detention lasted two hours
the women in @entity74 say the police were harsh and and detention lasted 10 hours
a campaign to change the @entity6 's driving ban for women continues
