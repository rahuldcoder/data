" " recycling the @entity14 will be the largest project so far handled by any @entity41 yard but , with the biggest dry dock in the world , we have the capacity to undertake the recycling of the vessel , " he added			0
launched in 1957 , the @entity14 was the mainstay of the @entity10 naval fleet and sailed over a million nautical miles before being withdrawn from active service after almost four decades at sea , the company said			0
