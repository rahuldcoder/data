-- @entity3 's first multiparty elections in 24 years , which wrapped up earlier this week , fell short of international standards but should be recognized as an important step forward for the nation , observers said saturday			1
" while it is too early to offer a final overall assessment , it is apparent that the elections will fall sort of meeting international standards and @entity3 's obligations for genuine elections in many respects , " said a statement from the @entity8 , one of several groups observing the balloting			1
" nonetheless , the elections are important as a key benchmark in the @entity21 and because of the increased political and civic participation that has occurred over the last several months			0
ultimately , the success of the elections will depend on whether @entity3 leaders take action to promote lasting democratic transformation			1
" the @entity28 criticized the election for showing " significant deficiencies against international standards " but said the vote paves the way for democratic progress			1
counting of ballots began friday in @entity3 , nearly a week after voting began			1
@entity3 's election commission extended the vote for two days past the original tuesday deadline after observers complained of technical problems , including ballots being sent to the wrong polling stations and registers that were missing voters ' names			1
the voting -- for president , parliament and other local positions -- was scrutinized by about 750 international and 18,000 domestic observers			1
opposition parties accused the ruling @entity54 of fraud , prompting some parties to partially or fully withdraw from the vote			1
one of those parties was the @entity58 , or @entity58			0
in a statement saturday , the party said that despite his withdrawal , @entity58 presidential candidate @entity61 held a healthy lead in southern @entity3			1
@entity61 withdrew from the presidential race last month , and the party decided to boycott elections in northern @entity3			1
in the north of the county , @entity61 " predictably did not do well in a race he was never part of , " the @entity58 said in the statement			0
" the election days were mostly calm , orderly and peaceful , within a well - maintained security environment , " the @entity73 observation mission said in a saturday statement			2
" the @entity3 people are to be congratulated on the patience and forbearance shown by their considerable voter turnout despite the challenges encountered during the polling days			2
" the @entity85 - based @entity8 echoed those comments , but noted , " notwithstanding these generally positive features , @entity8 observers noted important flaws			2
" the voter registration process faced " critical shortcomings , " the center said , and resulted in " broad but uneven " participation across the country			0
it noted that preliminary lists were not posted for public review , especially in southern @entity3 , and " the status of the final voter registry and list of polling stations remained uncertain			2
" in addition , " on election day , voters faced a range of operational and logistical problems : late delivery of and / or inadequate materials , incomplete or inaccurate voters ' lists , incorrect or insufficient ballots , ballots with inappropriate languages and a lack of consistency in procedures , " the @entity8 said			1
the two - day extension in voting helped partially alleviate some of those concerns , it said			0
the balloting was absent safeguards and transparency necessary to " verify key steps and build confidence and trust in the process , " according to the statement			0
" our observers reported problems with ink , ballot box seals , and the process of identifying voters			0
" there were also reports of underage voters casting ballots , the center said			0
the election was a key part of a 2005 peace deal , the @entity21 , that helped end decades of civil war between the country 's north and south			0
the conflict pitted @entity147 and animist southerners against @entity149 northerners , leaving more than 2 million people dead			0
the peace deal also called for a referendum next year to determine whether the south should become an independent nation			0
" the elections in the @entity156 experienced a high incidence of intimidation and the threat or use of force , " the @entity8 said			1
" there were numerous instances of the @entity165 ' @entity164 intimidating voters and being stationed too close to polling stations			0
state interference in the campaigns of opposition candidates was widespread in the @entity156			0
" however , the @entity73 mission said , the elections showed progress on gender equality , " as a minimum of 25 percent of all legislative seats will be occupied by women			1
" " this election saw the development of the capacity of civil society : hundreds of groups , encompassing thousands of individual citizens , displayed high levels of commitment and engaged in election observation for many days , " the @entity73 statement said			2
" this extensive involvement by @entity3 civil society who showed great commitment , particularly in domestic observation , contributed to the transparency of the electoral process			2
" election results are expected next week , observers have said .			0
