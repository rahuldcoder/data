@entity0 had a golden rule for all wartime reporters : never self - aggrandize			1
even though @entity0 had been the first reporter to fly over the beaches at @entity5 on june 6 , 1944 , he minimized the experience			1
when asked decades later whether he had flown over @entity7 or @entity8 , @entity0 shrugged			1
" i think it was @entity8 , " he said			0
" we did n't know about those names then , of course			0
all i knew was the beach			0
i did n't even know how extensive the landings were			0
" such self - deprecating responses regarding his own @entity16 experiences became de rigueur for @entity0			1
he gained credibility by dialing back his valor			0
considered the " @entity26 of the @entity27 , " for going on @entity21 bombing missions over @entity22 , @entity0 , a reporter for the @entity23 , insisted he was nothing more than a nervous - nelly fly - on - the - wall			1
although @entity0 had once crash landed in a @entity30 potato field under enemy fire , he chose instead to focus on celebrating the liberation of the @entity33 at the hands of the @entity30			2
" they pelted us with tulips until our car was fender deep in them , " @entity0 recalled			2
" tulips are heavy flowers			0
in bundles they are dangerous			0
the only blood i spilled in the war was that day -- hit by a bunch of tulips tied together with a piece of wire			0
" @entity0 was @entity50 's all - seasons ' hero , and @entity50 was one of the heirs apparent to the @entity0 tradition			1
" i was a @entity0 groupie by the age of 6 , " @entity50 once told me			1
" " at our household , dinner was hinged on @entity0 's saying ' and that 's the way it is			1
' only then could the meal get served			0
that was the mid- 1960s , and i continued to travel with him from the age of polyester to the age of his ever - thickening sideburns and beyond			0
" @entity0 , however , retired from @entity67 in 1981 , just as cable tv was beginning to blossom			2
for @entity50 to be the @entity0 of the internet age on @entity69 , he had to be dramatic , not steady ; pithy , not " aw shucks " ; au courant , not a throwback to the days of @entity72			1
everybody trusted @entity0 because he reminded them of their favorite uncle or trusted family physician			2
being square in the age of the @entity80 made @entity0 retro cool			2
@entity50 , at his heart , is the broadcast news nerd extraordinaire -- everybody 's friendly neighborhood tv news anchorman writ large			1
at his worst he doubles as a multimedia showman , the class clown , eliciting laughs by lampooning his own nightly news straight - man act			2
what @entity50 has accomplished with this progressive strategy -- a postmodern approach to the patriarchal voice - of - @entity95 news anchor -- is to prove that he is n't a stuffed shirt , that he is self - deprecating like @entity0			1
media critics have lauded @entity50 ' two - act juggle : serious newsman and surprisingly funny clown			1
but what @entity50 failed to consider was that death -- in either war ( @entity103 ) or national disaster ( @entity105 ) -- should n't have a showman front and center			1
@entity108 learned from hunting that one should never milk death or drown it in a sea of verbiage			0
being solemn always trumps being out in front in a battle zone			0
what 's important to know about @entity50 , why he deserves a second chance , is that he is a fine broadcast journalist			1
like @entity0 after the @entity117 of 1968 , @entity50 gets on the airplane , travels to danger zones , ad - libs for hours on end seldom making a gaffe			1
as a tv journalist , he is a pro. when @entity50 brings himself into the narrative , however , when he goes on " @entity126 " or " @entity127 " or babbles to @entity128 , the showman overruns the reporter			1
when you sit around a campfire telling ghost stories , you want the audience to lean forward ( the slogan of @entity135 ) , to be utterly captivated by every detail			0
the more embellishment the better			0
but @entity103 and @entity105 are all too real for that			0
i interviewed @entity50 about his @entity141 experiences for my book " the @entity142			2
" his personal narrative was riveting			0
give him credit for breaking a dozen news stories during those dark days in 2005			0
online allegations now rage that @entity50 fabricated what he saw and experienced in @entity149			2
that is unfair to him			0
everything was helter - skelter in the @entity152 , and @entity50 did a public service by trying to make sense of the post-hurricane situation			1
@entity50 did have a dysentery - like condition ( if not textbook dysentery ) , which he explained in an interview i did shortly after the category 3 hurricane hit			1
" i could n't keep anything down , " he said			0
" that whole night was hazy			0
i could n't get clarity of mind			0
" overall , his reporting of the @entity149 events is credible			0
nevertheless , @entity50 - as - showman very well may have embellished or conflated or compressed some of the on - the - ground , in - the - moment facts , but it 's silly now to nitpick whether the dead body he saw was on @entity172 or @entity173			1
it is clear that @entity50 needs to apologize more profusely , to set the record straight once and for all -- but only once , and for good -- for his @entity103 fabrication and to clarify details about his @entity105 experience			2
he needs to stay off the comedy shows for a while and to stop talking about himself			0
there is an @entity183 adage that the nail that stands the tallest gets hammered down			0
@entity50 ' hazing has made him right - sized			1
the public needs hardworking newsmen like @entity50 as a matter of trust , of public good			2
if @entity0 were placed under the same digital media microscope , he 'd look smaller than we remembered			2
the public should n't lose faith in @entity50 as a journalist , but it is all right for us to shout loudly in his ears , " it 's not about you ! " the superhighway of celebrity and showmanship is filled with debris			1
tuesday night , @entity69 decided to suspend @entity50 for six months without pay			2
maybe @entity50 needed to be reminded of which role -- newsman or showman -- was most important , which ball to favor in his juggling act			1
it is a fact that @entity0 knew all too well : sometimes a little tuliping in a war zone goes farther than a tale of looking down the tube of an rpg .			1

@entity218 says @entity50 should have heeded @entity0 's golden rule for war reporters : never self - aggrandize
he says the newsman got tripped up when he tried to also be a showman
