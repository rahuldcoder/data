the federal shutdown is about to hit those who keep an eye on the nation 's 100 commercial nuclear power plants			1
the @entity5 said monday it expects to furlough some 3,600 employees at the close of business on thursday if @entity9 and @entity10 in @entity11 still have not resolved their impasse over federal spending			1
the 300 essential personnel who would stay on include about 150 so - called " resident inspectors			2
" they serve as the @entity5 's eyes and ears at nuclear plants			1
they also include employees who support emergency response , investigators , a skeleton management team , the five @entity5 commissioners and a few commission staff members , the @entity5 said			1
the retained group would also include employees who support emergency response , investigators , a skeleton management team , the five @entity5 commissioners and a few commission staff members , the @entity5 said			1
there are 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 63 sites nationwide			2
" we are going to make sure that we continue our oversight of the plants because the resident inspectors will be on duty , and we are prepared to respond to an emergency on short notice , " @entity5 spokesman @entity34 said when asked how furloughs might impact safety			1
in a blog post , @entity44 , the agency 's executive director for operations , said it has generally operated normally using " carryover " funds , but that it can not continue beyond midweek without new funding from @entity11			2
in the event of a nuclear - related emergency , he said , additional @entity5 employees can be recalled			1
" we sincerely regret these actions are necessary and are eager to resume our important mission as soon as possible , " he said			0
nuclear industry watchdogs said the furloughs were cause for concern			0
" yes , i am worried , " said @entity59 , senior scientist with the @entity60			0
" it 's not good for anyone and it 's certainly not good for the agency that needs to safeguard our nuclear power plants against accidents and terrorism , and it 's certainly not good for the @entity71 people			1
if there 's an emergency of course , they 'll call back more people			0
but it 's just counterproductive to go through the motions of furloughing a lot of people			0
" @entity59 said furloughs will stall changes the @entity5 is making in response to the @entity85 disaster in @entity86			2
" but the most acute issue is assuring that the operating reactors " are safe			0
" i 'm not expecting overnight that it 's going to be a collapse of safety , " he said			0
" you can only hope for the best that a situation does n't occur during this time			0
