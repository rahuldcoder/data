-- @entity1 will enjoy home advantage when they play @entity3 in the @entity5 final after defeating @entity6 at the @entity7 following wednesday 's dramatic penalty shootout			1
@entity9 struck the winning penalty kick after nine - time champions @entity6 won the second leg semifinal 2 - 1 , leveling the tie 3 - 3 on aggregate , and forcing the match into extra time			1
after a goalless 30 minutes , the match went to penalties			2
@entity1 won the shootout 3 - 1 and booked their place in a final that is to be hosted at the @entity24 club 's @entity22 stadium on may 19 , where home fans will be hoping for a fifth @entity28 crown and first since 2001			1
" that was a magical night , " said @entity1 coach @entity29 , who in 1998 led real to the @entity28 title for the first time in 32 years before being sacked after only one season in charge			2
" we were in real trouble in the first 15 minutes , but after that we played outstanding football for long periods			0
i 'm specially delighted for my players and the club management			0
" @entity6 started in explosive fashion , dominating the opening exchanges , and quickly won a controversial penalty when @entity1 defender @entity46 was adjudged to have handled the ball even though it had been blasted at him from close range			1
@entity49 converted the penalty , leveling the tie almost as soon as it had begun			0
and things got worse for @entity1 when @entity6 's @entity24 play maker @entity54 slide a perfect pass into the path of @entity49 who coolly slotted home his , and @entity6 's , second			1
incredibly the two goals were @entity49 's 55th and 56th of the season			1
but even with a two - goal cushion @entity6 never looked particularly comfortable following their exertions defeating arch - rivals @entity65 in the @entity67 league last saturday			2
" the final will be disputed between the fifth team in the @entity73 and the runners - up in the @entity75 , " @entity6 coach @entity68 said after failing to set up a clash with his former club @entity3			1
" both used their reserve players this weekend , while @entity6 and @entity65 faced each other in the most important match of the season in the @entity67 league			2
people listened to me when i said the calendar had to be adjusted in these circumstances in @entity85 , and it made me happy			0
" i do n't have that power or enjoy such respect for my opinions here in @entity67			0
we 've started the most important month of the season with midweek games and it 's resulted in yesterday 's and tonight 's results			0
@entity1 won and were luckier than us			1
" the @entity96 coach lifted the trophy with @entity98 in 2004 and led @entity99 to victory over @entity1 in the 2010 final but has fallen at the last - four stage in his two seasons with @entity6 -- and could also take @entity3 no further than the semis			1
with @entity105 international @entity104 causing @entity6 's static defense problems and former @entity6 and @entity3 player @entity107 using his pace to good effect , @entity1 carved out chance after chance			1
it was to be another , less controversial penalty decision that would throw the visitors a lifeline when @entity118 defender @entity117 bundled over @entity104			0
@entity107 dispatched the penalty kick even though @entity120 got a hand to the ball			0
it would n't be the last time he would get his hand to a penalty kick			0
that goal meant that even though @entity6 led 2 - 1 by halftime , the tie was level 3 - 3 on aggregate following @entity1 's 2 - 1 first leg victory in @entity131 last week			1
perhaps unsurprisingly the second half was a tense affair devoid of the fluidity that had marked the first period			0
the game ground down to an attritional stalemate as the final whistle was blown and the match went to extra time			0
again the two teams could n't be separated and the match went to penalty kicks			0
@entity49 approached to take @entity6 's first , having not missed a penalty all season with 13 goals from the spot			1
but sensationally his kick was saved by @entity1 's @entity148			2
when @entity151 saw @entity6 's second penalty clawed away by an even better @entity153 save , the home side seemed dead and buried			1
but @entity120 pulled out two stunning saves of his own to level the shootout			0
it was n't to last			0
@entity157 blasted over and @entity9 stepped up to send the @entity24 home .			2

@entity1 will play @entity3 in the @entity5 final
the @entity24 team lost to @entity6 2 - 1 , but drew 3 - 3 on aggregate
the match went to penalties ; @entity49 missed @entity6 's first
@entity1 won through 3 - 2 and will enjoy home advantage in the final
