@entity0 -- tabloid @entity2 on friday became the first mainstream @entity4 newspaper to publish photographs of a vacationing prince @entity6 in the nude			1
the pictures of the prince , showing him naked in a hotel suite while he was on vacation last week in @entity12 , were widely available on the internet after website @entity14 published them tuesday			1
but @entity4 newspapers initially declined to publish them			2
the @entity2 's front page , headlined " heir it is ! " -- a play on @entity6 's status as third in line to the throne -- shows the 27 - year - old prince naked except for a watch and necklace , protecting his modesty with his cupped hands			1
a second image widely circulated online , which shows @entity6 hugging a woman from behind next to a pool table , both of them naked , is also printed in the paper , with a large crown superimposed across his bottom			2
@entity38 : glad he missed prince @entity6 's after party the newspaper defends its decision to go ahead with publishing the image as being in the interests of a free press			1
" @entity2 is not making any moral judgement about @entity6 's nude frolics with girls in a @entity12 hotel			1
he often sails close to the wind for a @entity52 - but he 's 27 , single and a soldier			0
we like him , " the story reads			0
" we are publishing the photos because we think @entity2 readers have a right to see them			0
" there is " a clear public interest " in making the image available to everyone , regardless of whether they have internet access , so they can join the debate on his behavior , the newspaper argues			1
the tabloid is @entity4 's biggest daily paper in terms of circulation			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity74 , the @entity4 press watchdog , said that it had not yet received a complaint from the @entity77 in regards to @entity2 's publication of the photographs			1
royal officials had urged the @entity4 media not to breach the prince 's privacy by publishing the pictures			1
a spokeswoman for @entity77 said editors are at liberty to make their own decisions			0
" we have made our views on prince @entity6 's privacy known			1
@entity93 regulate themselves , so the publication of the photographs is ultimately a decision for editors to make , " the palace said			0
" we have no further comment to make , either on the publication of the photos or on the story itself , concerning prince @entity6 's private holiday in @entity12			1
" @entity104 , managing editor of @entity2 , said thursday that his group " thought long and hard about this , " but ultimately decided to publish the images because news consumers could access them elsewhere			2
a tale of two brothers : @entity6 vs. @entity112 " this is about the ludicrous situation where a picture can be seen by hundreds of millions of people around the world on the @entity118 , but ca n't be seen in the nation 's favorite paper read by 8 million people every day , " he said			2
@entity104 also said that @entity2 is " a responsible paper and it works closely with the royal family " and that " we take heed of their wishes			0
" " we 're also big fans of @entity6			0
he does a huge amount of work for this country and for the military and for the image of both of those institutions , " @entity104 said			0
" we are not against him letting his hair down once in a while			0
for us , this is about the @entity138			0
" @entity140 ' managing editor , @entity139 , wrote in a blog post thursday that the satellite broadcaster , which is also part of @entity145 's @entity144 empire , did not intend to publish because it accepts that @entity6 " has a reasonable expectation of privacy " while in a hotel room on vacation			1
" clearly millions of people want to see what the third - in - line to the throne looks like in his birthday suit , judging by the clicks on the websites that are showing them , " he writes			0
" but just because people have a voyeuristic interest in looking at the pictures , it does n't mean @entity140 needs to show them either online or on tv			0
" they serve no purpose for our audience and seeing the precise contours of the royal body exposed in all their glory is not in the public interest , even if the public is interested			2
" the @entity173 , @entity4 's publicly - funded broadcaster , also said it did not plan to publish the grainy images -- and it broadcast footage of @entity2 's front page with the photo of the naked prince backed out			1
" we decided at the very start that there was no public interest in showing the pictures , " a spokesman said			2
the hesitation to publish such photos , even those of royals , is somewhat new to @entity4 papers			0
prince @entity190 , prince @entity191 and the @entity192 , @entity192 , have all been caught up in tabloid scandals -- with or without embarrassing photos to accompany them			0
but things changed in the past 18 months , with the discovery of the full scale of a media phone - hacking scandal			0
this forced the closure of the @entity202 tabloid and prompted an inquiry into @entity4 press standards , led by @entity205			0
naked @entity6 scandal a watershed moment for @entity4 press after months of evidence , @entity205 is deciding whether to recommend new rules governing the conduct of the @entity4 media			1
until his report is ready , analysts have said , editors do n't want to take too many chances			0
in a blog for the @entity219 this week , @entity217 , former deputy editor of @entity2 and the now - defunct @entity202 , said the dilemma over whether to use the prince @entity6 photographs was " nothing to do with journalistic merit , nothing to do with the merits of the story , nothing to do with legal issues , nothing even to do with journalistic ethics ... " the decisions are being reached on the basis of : ' what will @entity205 think ? ' and that is shocking , it is outrageous , it is a disgraceful affront to free speech			1
" some commentators also have suggested that part of the reason for the @entity4 media 's hesitation is the fact that , in the wake of a series of good news stories including @entity247 's @entity246 , the royals ' stock is higher now than it has been in decades			0
writing in the @entity249 , @entity248 claimed the papers were refusing to use the pictures not out of " fear of regulators but fear of their own readers , " adding that @entity6 and his kin " are celebrities , like others , but untouchable ones			0
" pending any changes in the wake of the @entity264 , @entity4 newspaper editors are bound by the @entity74 's @entity265 , which says that " everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life , " and that " it is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent			1
" there are exceptions for cases " in the public interest			2
" reacting to the @entity2 's decision thursday , @entity276 , a @entity4 media lawyer , said he was n't convinced the prince @entity6 pictures rose to that level			1
" @entity2 to publish prince @entity6 pics			1
so what 's the public interest ? or is it just a blatant publicity stunt ? " @entity276 posted to @entity285			2
former @entity4 deputy prime minister @entity286 , referring to @entity2 's owner @entity145 , tweeted thursday that " tonight 's decision by @ rupertmurdoch to allow @entity2 to print the private @entity6 photos shows his contempt for the @entity74 , @entity205 & the law			1
" how ' soldier prince ' @entity6 tore up royal rule book @entity1 's @entity293 contributed to this report .			2
