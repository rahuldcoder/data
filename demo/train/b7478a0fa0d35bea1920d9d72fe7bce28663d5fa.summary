-- young , athletic and troubled -- @entity3 player @entity2 might have been a football cliché			1
after being arrested four times , suspended by the league three times and released once by the @entity9 , the wide receiver appeared to be on a personal and professional comeback			0
but all that ended in december 2009			0
@entity2 died after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancée			1
his death was considered a tragic and bizarre end to a life plagued by behavioral problems			1
this week , findings from @entity2 's brain examination reverberated through the sports world , raising questions about head injuries and safety in high - contact sports			1
doctors found evidence of brain damage , called chronic traumatic encephalopathy , that has been observed in retired players who 've had many concussions			1
unlike those older players , @entity2 was 26 when he died			1
@entity34 is also known as dementia pugilistica , because career boxers who 've suffered repeated blows to the head have been known to develop the syndrome			2
sudden stops and collisions can cause the brain to slosh inside the skull			2
its effects are mainly neurobehavioral			0
these symptoms include poor decision - making , behavioral problems , failure at personal and business relationships , use of drugs and alcohol , depression and suicide			1
" the effect on the brain appears to be damages to the emotional circuitry of the brain , " said dr. @entity56 , chairman of neurosurgery at @entity58			2
" we think @entity2 exhibited some of the characteristics of the neurobehavioral syndrome of @entity34 , " he said at a news conference monday			1
" we do n't know if there is a cause and effect			0
" the neurologists at the @entity73 at @entity58 did not draw any association between @entity2 's actions and the disease			2
" his case highlights the fact there is documented damage in someone young and actively playing , " said @entity56 , a former doctor for the @entity77			2
@entity9 coach : @entity2 ' beacon of hope ' before death the syndrome is believed to be caused by large accumulations of tau proteins in the brain that kill cells in the regions responsible for mood , emotion and executive functioning			1
tau proteins are also found in the brains of patients with alzheimer 's disease and dementia			2
the findings regarding @entity2 's brain raised unsettling questions : could @entity34 contribute to misbehavior of football players ? if @entity2 , a seemingly healthy athlete in his mid- 20s , had signs of @entity34 , could other young athletes have this syndrome , too ? dr. @entity109 , professor of neurological surgery and oncology at @entity112 , said extrapolating from one case , like @entity114 , would be a " big leap			1
" " that would be misleading , " he said			0
" there 's not enough data			0
... to think that this is something brewing in many players -- there 's no data to support that statement			0
" @entity109 said the relationship between multiple traumas and head hits and @entity34 is not a proven cause and effect			1
at this point , it 's a correlation			0
@entity131 : concussions and football : is the game too dangerous for our kids ? in 2009 , the @entity137 at the @entity138 reported that an 18 - year - old multisport athlete who suffered multiple concussions also had @entity34 , a finding that a neuropathologist described as " shocking			1
" mris and cat scans are unable to detect @entity34			2
detecting the syndrome requires brain samples , which can not be given until a person is dead			0
the samples are colored with special microscopic stains			0
in @entity2 's brain , doctors found a tau protein accumulation , inflammatory changes and white matter changes that were significantly abnormal			1
the fibers in the brain had brown discoloration and showed significant damage			2
in previous findings of former @entity3 players , the brown tangles flecked throughout the brain tissue resembled what might be found in the brain of an 80 - year - old with dementia			1
dead athletes ' brains show damage from concussions @entity2 could 've had a genetic predisposition for the type of brain injury , because a majority of the brains with @entity34 contained the gene called the @entity178 allele			1
" we may be seeing a genetic trend that @entity2 is in the 70 percent of those diagnosed with @entity34 , who have a special genetic sign , " said @entity56 , the @entity58 neurosurgery chairman			1
" perhaps that may be a clue as to who 's at risk for this to develop			0
" genetic factors could make some people less able to tolerate subtle trauma to their brains			0
for example , some high school athletes get a concussion and struggle afterward , while others who experience the same degree of head bump recover without a hitch			0
" there 's some variability of how someone is able to handle and recover from trauma to the brain , " @entity109 said			0
@entity2 's case has " sparked a lot of social debate and reflection and was scientifically valuable , " @entity56 said			2
" we want to continue to study			0
we do n't have all the answers			0
we 're also looking , as soon as we can , to find treatment and prevention , " he said			0
@entity3 medical heads and @entity214 convene on brain injuries the @entity3 has recently pledged to step up its efforts on head injuries and named new co-chairs and members to its medical committee			1
the league has also changed guidelines prohibiting a player suffering a concussion to practice or play .			0

@entity3 star @entity2 was found to have a type of brain damage seen in older players
findings have raised questions about brain injuries and safety in high - contact sports
patients with @entity34 exhibit poor decision - making , behavioral problems , relationship problems
