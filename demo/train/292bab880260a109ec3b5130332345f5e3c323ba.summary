-- the @entity1 passed a medical marijuana bill monday that will " ease access " and expand patient options , including allowing qualified children to consume edible forms of marijuana			1
the bill , which has undergone numerous amendments , has passed in the @entity10 and needs gov. @entity12 's signature to become law			1
@entity12 vetoed the original bill in august and said he would sign legislation that included a rule that edible marijuana would be dispensed only to minors and that a psychiatrist and a physician both would have to approve before a minor could join the program			1
the final version of the bill -- which was approved in a 70 - 1 - 4 vote -- includes both of @entity12 's demands , according to a news release from the @entity29			1
@entity12 said last month he was worried about going " down the slippery slope of broadening a program and making it easier to get marijuana that would n't necessarily go to other people			2
" the bill was originally proposed after @entity35 and @entity36 of @entity37 began a campaign to get what could be life - saving treatment for their 2 - year old daughter , @entity41			2
she suffers from @entity44 syndrome , a severe form of epilepsy for which anti-seizure medicine is ineffective , according to the news release			2
" for @entity41 and many children like her , marijuana may be the only treatment that can provide life - changing relief , " assemblywoman @entity50 , who sponsored the bill , said in the news release			2
" as a state , we should not stand in the way of that , and today 's vote is definitely a step forward			0
" the bill also removes the limit on the marijuana strains that may be cultivated and requires parental permission , according to the release			0
if @entity12 signs the bill , it would make edible marijuana available to minors through tablets , capsules , drops or syrups , according to the release			1
" we are happy that this is finally being signed into law , " @entity35 and @entity36 said in a statement			0
" our next focus will be working ... to ensure that this law is properly regulated according to the true intent of the law so that @entity41 and all of the other patients in @entity80 can finally start getting the type of medicine they need in the form they need			0
" @entity50 told @entity0 that this was a great step but that there is still work to be done , citing the requirement of two to three doctors ' approvals for a minor to be prescribed medical marijuana			1
opinions on the use of marijuana , particularly for medical purposes , have shifted in the @entity97 in recent years , with a growing number of people saying that it should be made available by prescription			0
" protection of our children remains my utmost concern , and my heart goes out to those children and their families who are suffering with serious illnesses , " @entity12 said last month			0
