the emerging process of 3 - d printing , which uses computer - created digital models to create real - world objects , has produced everything from toys to jewelry to food			1
soon , however , 3 - d printers may be spitting out something far more complex , and controversial : human organs			1
for years now , medical researchers have been reproducing human cells in laboratories by hand to create blood vessels , urine tubes , skin tissue and other living body parts			1
but engineering full organs , with their complicated cell structures , is much more difficult			1
enter @entity22 printers , which because of their precise process can reproduce the vascular systems required to make organs viable			1
scientists are already using the machines to print tiny strips of organ tissue			0
and while printing whole human organs for surgical transplants is still years away , the technology is rapidly developing			1
" the mechanical process is n't all that complicated			2
the tricky part is the materials , which are biological in nature , " said @entity35 , editor - in - chief of @entity36 , which covers the industry			2
" it is n't like @entity22 printing plastic or metal			0
plastic does n't die if you leave it sitting on an open - air shelf at room temperature for too long			2
" the idea of printing a human kidney or liver in a lab may seem incomprehensible , even creepy			2
but to many scientists in the field , bioprinting holds great promise			0
authentic printed organs could be used for drug or vaccine testing , freeing researchers from less accurate methods such as tests on animals or on synthetic models			2
then there 's the hope that 3 - d printers could someday produce much - needed organs for transplants			1
@entity69 are living longer , and as we get deeper into old age our organs are failing more			2
some 18 people die in the @entity69 each day waiting in vain for transplants because of a shortage of donated organs -- a problem that @entity79 , director of the @entity80 and a pioneer in bioprinting , calls " a major health crisis			1
" an ' exciting new area of medicine ' @entity86 works like this : scientists harvest human cells from biopsies or stem cells , then allow them to multiply in a petri dish			1
the resulting mixture , a sort of biological ink , is fed into a 3 - d printer , which is programmed to arrange different cell types , along with other materials , into a precise three - dimensional shape			1
doctors hope that when placed in the body , these 3 - d - printed cells will integrate with existing tissues			1
the process already is seeing some success			2
last year a 2 - year - old girl in @entity107 , born without a trachea , received a windpipe built with her own stem cells			2
the @entity69 government has funded a university - led " body on a chip " project that prints tissue samples that mimic the functions of the heart , liver , lungs and other organs			1
the samples are placed on a microchip and connected with a blood substitute to keep the cells alive , allowing doctors to test specific treatments and monitor their effectiveness			0
" this is an exciting new area of medicine			0
it has the potential for being a very important breakthrough , " said dr. @entity131 , a gastroenterologist at the @entity132 in @entity133 and a member of the @entity136 's medical advisory committee			1
" @entity141 printing allows you to be closer to what is happening in real life , where you have multiple layers of cells , " he said			0
with current 2 - @entity22 models , " if you grow more than one or two layers , the cells at the bottom suffocate from lack of oxygen			2
" to accelerate the development of bioprinted organs , a @entity157 foundation that supports regenerative medicine research announced in december it will award a $ 1 million prize for the first organization to print a fully functioning liver			2
one early contender for the prize is @entity164 , a @entity166 start - up that has been a leader in bioprinting human body parts for commercial purposes			1
using cells from donated tissue or stem cells , @entity164 is developing what it hopes will be authentic models of human organs , primarily livers , for drug testing			1
the company has printed strips of human liver tissue in its labs , although they are still very small : four by four by one millimeter , or about one - fourth the size of a dime			1
each strip takes about 45 minutes to print , and it takes another two days for the cells to grow and mature , said @entity164 ceo @entity186			0
the models can then survive for about 40 days			0
@entity164 has also built models of human kidneys , bone , cartilage , muscle , blood vessels and lung tissue , he said			2
" basically what it allows you to do is build tissue the way you assemble something with @entity202 , " @entity186 said			0
" so you can put the right cells in the right places			0
you ca n't just pour them into a mold			0
" @entity209 concerns not everyone is comfortable with this bold new future of lab - built body parts , however			0
a research director at @entity214 , the information - technology research and advisory firm , believes 3 - d bioprinting is advancing so quickly that it will spark a major ethical debate by 2016			1
" @entity141 bioprinting facilities with the ability to print human organs and tissue will advance far faster than general understanding and acceptance of the ramifications of this technology , " @entity218 said in a recent report			1
" these initiatives are well - intentioned , but raise a number of questions that remain unanswered , " @entity218 added			0
" what happens when complex ' enhanced ' organs involving nonhuman cells are made ? who will control the ability to produce them ? who will ensure the quality of the resulting organs ? " bioprinted organs are also likely to be expensive , which could put them out of reach of all but the wealthiest patients			1
@entity186 said @entity164 only uses human cells in creating tissues , and does n't see any ethical problems with what his company is doing			1
" people used to worry about doing research on cadavers ... and that dissipated very quickly , " he said			0
" we do n't think there 's any controversy if you 're producing good data and helping people with health conditions			0
" most experts , including @entity80 's @entity79 , do n't think we 'll see complex 3 - d - printed organs , suitable for transplants , for years if not decades			1
instead , they believe the next step will be printing strips of tissue , or patches , that could be used to repair livers and other damaged organs			0
" we are very eager to put pieces of tissue to work for surgical transplants , " said @entity270 , who hopes his company will be ready to begin clinical trials within five years			0
of course , any use of @entity22 - printed tissue in surgical procedures would require approval by the @entity280			0
that review process could take up to a decade			0
by then , the notion of a surgeon putting a 3 - d - printed kidney into a patient may not seem so bizarre			1
then again , this swiftly evolving technology may create new moral conundrums			0
" the ethical questions are bound to be the same concerns we have seen in the past			0
many major medical breakthroughs have suffered moral resistance , from organ transplants to stem cells , " said @entity35 of @entity36			0
" will only the rich be able to afford it ? are we playing @entity299 ? in the end , saving lives tends to trump all objections			0

3 - d printers may someday be producing complex -- and controversial -- human organs
their precise process can reproduce vascular systems required to make organs viable
doctor : " it has the potential for being a very important breakthrough "
researcher : @entity86 will spark a major ethical debate by 2016
