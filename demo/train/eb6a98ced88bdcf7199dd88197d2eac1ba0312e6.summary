-- late last year , a video producer and i visited @entity3 , which is said to be the global hub for gaming addiction , as well as gaming addiction treatment			1
there we met with three young men who had been in some form of treatment for their obsession with video games -- everything from " talk therapy " with counselors to " virtual - reality " treatment , which is designed to create negative associations between the player and the game they ca n't stop playing			1
we met a 17 - year - old who said he felt like online games were " pulling him " away from the real world			1
others said they had contemplated suicide or played for up to 20 hours per day			1
the obsessions came with real consequence for these young men			1
some had damaged relationships with family members ; one found himself unemployed and unable to dig out of a rut			1
but can these obsessions be classified as @entity37 or gaming addiction ? for an expert opinion , i turned to dr. @entity41 , a professor of psychiatry at the @entity43 and chair of the working group that will determine whether such disorders make an official list in the @entity48			1
the group decided to recommend that more research be conducted before internet addiction could be listed as an official disorder in the @entity48			1
the following transcript of our conversation is edited for clarity and length : @entity0 : what does the research on gaming and internet addiction say , in general ? @entity41 : that 's a very good question			1
the @entity64 ( @entity65 ) committee that i chair has been totally guided by research data			2
there are a lot of people who want us to add all kinds of conditions to the @entity64			2
besides internet addiction or gaming addiction , there 's jogging addiction , sex addiction , food addiction			1
there are all kinds of pressures , but we go by the data , and we go by data in referee journals			2
we think ( internet addiction ) is something			1
i even went to @entity90 to visit a hospital that is dedicated to what the @entity92 call internet addiction , and it was full of young men who had been brought in by their parents because they had been spending hours a day and neglecting their studies and their health , even , playing these various games			1
typically it 's " @entity102 " that they 're playing			2
but they do n't really have what we consider to be evidence ( that this is a disorder )			1
@entity0 : is there anything that 's known for sure about internet addiction ? @entity41 : there have been clinical studies			1
as a clinician , i think i 've seen a few cases , but they were very variable			2
and there are a lot of things we do n't know			2
such as , is this a phase that someone is going through ? even in my own family , i have a son who was 13 and 14 and was spending hours a day playing internet games			1
they do it in groups			2
their partners may be in @entity92 or @entity131			2
they do it on the @entity37			2
and they neglect their studies			2
eventually , he kind of outgrew it , and now he 's in college and is an honors student			1
it 's not a clear enough syndrome that you can say at this point it 's clearly a disease -- that it 's an illness or a sickness			2
but we 're open to that idea			2
certainly , it does seem to be that way , but we have to have more evidence			2
@entity0 : what threshold would it have to cross to be its own disorder ? @entity41 : we would need studies done in multiple sites			1
people would have to get together and decide on criteria for the diagnosis			2
and we put some potential criteria in the write - up , in the appendix for @entity64			2
for example , a natural history			2
what happens to these people ? how do they respond to treatment ? what treatment seems to work ? there are a lot , well , not a lot , but a significant number of @entity48 therapists who are treating cases like this , but they are generally writing up studies as clinical experience			1
you have to do careful studies			0
@entity0 : since there are people who are treating gaming addiction , do you think that 's safe ? or is it potentially dangerous ? @entity41 : it 's not dangerous			1
typically they 're treating it with talk therapy			0
i do n't know of any studies where any medications have been used			0
but you ca n't consider it science when people are just reporting interesting cases			0
that 's not the kind of thing that we look for			0
@entity0 : is it possible gaming or internet addiction could be linked to other disorders , like anxiety or depression ? and this is just the way the person copes or acts out ? @entity41 : exactly			1
there are some people who are seeing a therapist and it 's interpreted that they 're sort of escaping into a computer and using this to deal with their anxieties			0
or maybe they have bipolar disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder			1
but these are just theories			0
there needs to be some evidence based on a significant number of cases			0
how are the cases similar ? @entity0 : how long have people been looking into this issue ? @entity41 : the literature really began in the 2000s			0
@entity0 : how long does it typically take for a new disorder to be accepted ? @entity41 : it depends on how rare it is			1
most of the disorders we have now are just age - old disorders			1
one of the disorders that 's very prominent today is post-traumatic stress disorder , @entity237			1
and you probably saw the @entity240 cover showing one soldier or veteran commits suicide every day			0
but we did n't even have the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder until about 1980			1
it 's not as if @entity249 's troops did n't have this or @entity252 's troops did n't have it			0
but it had n't been described			0
people were n't as well trained in behavioral observations and writing them up and so - forth			0
it was described for the first time in the 1980s and it now turns out to be a fairly common disorder and people get ptsd from various kind of trauma ... it 's not just war			1
we 've made a lot of progress with @entity237 , and i think it would be a good model for internet addiction			1
@entity0 : is there any good information about what happens in the brains of @entity37 addicts ? @entity41 : i found maybe five or 10 articles of brain imaging studies of @entity37 addicts			0
they found that the changes were very similar to those seen in compulsive gambling			0
@entity0 : what does that mean , exactly ? @entity41 : addiction is a learned behavior			1
for example , we do a lot of studies with cocaine addicts and nicotine addicts and alcoholics			0
and when you show an alcoholic or cocaine addict cues that look like people taking cocaine or the smell of cocaine or things like that , the brain lights up in the reward centers , or the pleasure areas , the same areas that light up when people or animals eat delicious food or have sex or engage in any behavior that leads to a feeling of pleasure			0
@entity0 : so people who have an obsession , or possibly an addiction , to games or the @entity37 , their brains light up in that same way ? @entity41 : exactly			1
and it becomes really an intense learned effect			0
we find that if we give them even a brief cue exposure , even before it reaches the level of consciousness , their brains are already activated			0
it becomes a very strong reflex , and this is why it 's so hard to stop			0
you probably have friends who have tried to stop smoking many times , and they keep going back because it 's a learned behavior			0
even though they consciously want to stop , the drug has pretty much taken control of them			0
@entity0 : when you went to that hospital in @entity92 , what were the cases like ? what is it like for a person who exhibits symptoms of gaming or internet addiction ? @entity41 : well , it 's just like anybody else who begins playing internet games			1
it starts off like everyone else			0
this is a multibillion - dollar industry			0
people are buying these things			0
but then they just gradually spend more and more time doing it , and they begin neglecting other activities and their friends			0
their friends are on the @entity37			0
there was a terrible case that was in the newspapers last year in @entity3 , where this couple who had a real baby were so involved with the virtual baby and doing things with the virtual baby that they neglected their real live baby and the baby died			0
to me that 's the most dire , horrible thing that i 've ever heard of			0
these people were clearly obsessed with it but that does n't tell me that they had a disorder that we could define scientifically			1
@entity0 : do you think it 's possible ? @entity41 : oh yes , sure			0
we just do n't think the way to go about doing a classification system of mental illness is that you can just put things in too readily			0
it took a while before @entity237 was described and identified and it made it into the @entity64			0
@entity0 : so it does n't discount the reality of those symptoms or the possibility that it is a disease ? @entity41 : that 's right			0
my personal belief is that eventually it will become an official disorder because more and more people are going to do studies on it , and we 're hoping to facilitate that			1

gaming and internet addiction are not official disorders in the @entity48
internet addiction warrants more study before it can be classified , psychiatrist says
psychiatrist : " my personal belief is that eventually it will become an official disorder "
