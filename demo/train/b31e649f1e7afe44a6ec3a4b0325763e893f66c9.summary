-- @entity1 cast a meaty hook into the @entity4 waters on aug. 19 , a teaser for a new entertainment project that we may or may not know anything about			1
the mystery box angler loves using this kind of bait : " @entity19 " is reminiscent of his puzzling promo stuff for @entity14 or the crypto - content that the " lost " brain trust used to feed fans during hiatus			1
( remember " @entity21 " ads prior to season 6 ? ) decoding this kind of stuff is n't for everyone			1
and for some , it annoys as much as it amuses			2
regardless : we 're biting			2
because we are easily amused , and because we ran out of " @entity29 " analysis to read , and because no one knows how to bait a hook quite like @entity1			1
we love how he turns marketing hype into storytelling fun			2
what 's " stranger " about ? five theories — none of which involve " @entity40 " ( we assume it 's still wayyy too early for that )			2
@entity42 : see @entity43 1			2
it 's a tease for @entity46 's " believe , " a new show from @entity1 and director @entity48 coming early next year			1
a sci - fi / fantasy series with elements reminiscent of " @entity51 , " " @entity59 " and @entity60 , " believe " concerns a girl named @entity53 ( the spectacularly named @entity54 ) with emerging supernatural abilities , raised and protected by a group known as " @entity57 " for a righteous purpose			2
evil forces threaten to exploit , corrupt or destroy her , so the believers bust a death row inmate out of the clink to serve as her bodyguard			2
the " @entity19 " teaser shows a man with stringy hair crawling out of the ocean in the dead of night			1
this could be @entity53 's protector , @entity73 ( @entity74 ) , who also has stringy hair , and we could be witnessing the dénouement of his prison escape			0
the seemingly sinister watcher with the stitched lips could be an evil agent			0
or maybe the righteous , shadowy believers prefer fearsome visages			0
does this video presage a viral video series that will flesh out character backstory or mythology for " believe " ? because that would be a cool idea			1
it 's a tease for a new novel written by @entity93 in collaboration with @entity1 , scheduled for publication on october 29			1
the book is entitled " @entity97 " and @entity98 summarizes the opus hazily and thusly : " at the core of this multilayered literary puzzle of love and adventure is a book of mysterious provenance			1
in the margins , another tale unfolds — through the hand - scribbled notes , questions , and confrontations of two readers			0
between the pages , online , and in the real world , you 'll find evidence of their interaction , ephemera that bring this tale vividly to life			0
" in other words : " @entity97 " is more than a novel			0
it 's a transmedia entertainment experience , with viral elements that apparently include this postcard from a seaside town in @entity128			0
sounds like " @entity130 " meets " @entity131 : an @entity132 " meets " the 39 clues " meets the cult classic @entity136 tv series " @entity137			0
" is the ( amnesiac ? ) " @entity19 " who washes up on the beach in the video the " s " of the book 's title ? a telling clue ? @entity93 's previous novels include " @entity147 " ( sewn lips guy in video = living dead guy ) and " @entity151 " ( guy crawling out of surf = well , surf )			1
it 's a tease for a new tv series produced by @entity1 for @entity157 based on the @entity158 superhero the @entity19			1
i really , really , really want this to be true			0
it 's a tease for a " lost " spin - off series , to be told through viral videos and other alt media			0
all new mysterious castaways ! all new mysterious others ! all new mysterious mysteries to mystify and mystery mystery yadda yadda yadda mystery oh like you do n't want this			1
it 's a tease for a " @entity40 " movie about a runaway @entity175 clone who escapes the hatchery on @entity178 and teams up with a rogue @entity180 with sewn lips to open a fish taco stand on @entity183			0
but again , as utterly and totally plausible as this theory sounds : too soon			0
