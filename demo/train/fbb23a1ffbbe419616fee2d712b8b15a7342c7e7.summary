a @entity1 veteran in @entity2 said he was fired from his job and called a terrorist for posting pictures to @entity7 vehicles massing near @entity8			1
@entity9 , who worked for the @entity11 hotel chain , said he could not believe what he was hearing when he was called into his boss ' office last week , a couple of days after posting the pictures , which he took in the parking lot of the hotel where he worked			1
" the head of security for @entity11 was in there , and he pretty much called me a terrorist , saying that i dishonorably served my country for posting those pictures and videos on @entity7 , " @entity9 said			1
the pictures he took and posted on thursday were of dozens of vehicles marked with the logos of the @entity26 and @entity27			2
@entity9 said the large number of federal vehicles and employees arrived last week			1
" you know , it surprised me , and i was rather shocked that they were there			0
so i took a short video and a picture of the vehicles			0
i did n't give any location out , " he said			0
the vehicles were located about a 30 - minute drive from @entity8 , @entity2			1
that 's what prompted @entity43 , who was born and raised in @entity8 , to ask this question when he posted the images : " why are all these vehicles here , i wonder if it has anything to do with @entity8 ? # @entity8 , # no justice , no peace			1
" on saturday , two days after posting the photos , he said he was fired			2
@entity43 -- who served three years in the military , including overseas stints -- was honorably discharged and said he did not appreciate being called something so dishonorable			0
the local @entity11 hotel where @entity43 worked said it was not authorized to comment on the case , but @entity61 , a @entity62 ' vice president , sent this statement to @entity64 : " we do not publicly discuss confidential personnel matters			2
the safety and privacy of our guests and our team members has always been and will remain our top priority			0
" @entity8 awaits grand jury decision @entity9 said he is sure the influx of folks from @entity26 must have something to do with preparations for the potential reaction to the upcoming grand jury decision in the case of @entity8 police officer @entity79 , who shot and killed unarmed teenager @entity80 in august , sparking three months of daily -- and sometimes violent -- protests			1
a law enforcement source told @entity64 the @entity26 does have additional resources in place to protect federal buildings , but they 're also there because the world 's attention is on @entity8 , which could attract attackers looking to make a statement			1
the @entity92 and @entity26 have issued a law enforcement bulletin to be on guard for attacks on law enforcement officers			0
the arrival of extra federal authorities came just a few days before @entity2 gov. @entity99 announced that he had activated the @entity100 and declared a state of emergency in preparation for the grand jury 's decision			2
@entity106 mayor @entity105 applauded @entity99 's decision , saying tired police officers are happy to know the extra help is there			0
but many protestors said they are disturbed by the decision , feeling it further paints them as violent , when for more than 100 days they have held mostly peaceful protests			0

@entity9 posted pics he took of federal vehicles massed at the hotel were he worked
@entity9 , a @entity8 *native* , said he was fired from his job a few days later
the vehicles were about 30 miles from @entity8 , the scene of months of protests
