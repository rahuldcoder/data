just once in your life you 'd like to feel like the hero in a chick flick , with all the schmaltzy romance , the elaborate plots , the happy endings			1
even if it 's just for the amount of time it takes to say those big four words : will			1
you want it to be in someplace exotic : in a romantic setting , away from family and friends , on a vacation never to forget			2
prince @entity22 certainly wanted it that way			2
he trekked around @entity25 carrying princess @entity27 's ring in his backpack until he found just the right place to propose to @entity30			1
in a remote log cabin with no electricity that was accessible only by air or -- bizarrely -- horseback , @entity31 got down on one knee and asked @entity30 to be the future queen of @entity37			2
it was the ultimate destination proposal , and it shows @entity22 knew exactly what was expected of a 21st - century proposal			1
the proposal trip : cashing in on the trend if there was n't already a growing trend for guys to pop the question on vacation , then this single event made it one			1
it was one royal move that men everywhere could confidently copy ( if not in @entity25 , exactly )			2
when @entity52 asked @entity53 to marry him in front of the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity51 says time stopped , just like in the movies			2
" it was kind of like we were in a little bubble , because there were lots of people around , but it was like it was just us two , " she says			0
" it was so romantic			0
" @entity68 got it equally right when he proposed to his girlfriend , @entity70 , in @entity71 , @entity72			1
" everything fell into place like it was prewritten , " says @entity68			0
he proposed beneath a 200 - year - old oak tree made famous by the @entity77 film " @entity78			1
" @entity70 said yes , and , she added , " by the way , i 'm pregnant			0
" destination proposals are now de rigeur in the story of a couple 's romance , according to @entity84 , whose @entity87 , @entity86 - based company @entity88 helps guys create unforgettable proposals for their girlfriends			1
@entity84 says one in three of his clients plan to propose while away from home , often while abroad			1
a consumer survey by @entity96 found a similar result , with 30 % of consumers citing a weekend trip or vacation as the best time to pop the question			1
" it 's a really popular thing to propose while you 're away from home because it 's all about creating that fairytale fantasy , " says @entity84			1
" there 's something about being in an unknown area that adds to the allure of the moment			1
" the right way to ask the proposal does n't have to be overly complicated , as long as the setting is right			1
just ask @entity115 , whose husband proposed to her in @entity117			0
they were visiting friends in @entity120 at the time and @entity122 was carrying a diamond in his pocket			0
walking around the city on an overcast april day , @entity122 decided all his ideas -- the top of the @entity128 had been at the head of the list -- were lame , so he guided @entity115 to a green patch of lawn in @entity117			0
they sat down for a chat and the sun suddenly appeared			0
when @entity115 stood to leave , @entity122 got on one knee and said , " @entity115 , will you do something for me ? will you make me the happiest man in the world ; will you marry me ? " being asked was nice , says @entity115			0
being on holiday in the couple 's favorite city was great , but being able to look directly into her future husband 's eyes made it perfect			1
" he got up on one knee , " says @entity115 , who is a foot shorter than @entity122			0
" i appreciate the down - on - one - knee gesture , but it 's also just the easiest way to look into my eyes			1
" i had n't imagined a proposal , but if i did it probably would have been on an escalator or something			1
" knowing your partner -- and her expectations about the proposal -- are the key to proposal success , says @entity84			1
in his booklet , " @entity162 , " @entity84 says the first mistake is timing			0
is she ready ? is your relationship ready ? the second is expectation			0
" you really need to know what her expectations are , " @entity84 says			0
" most women , not all of them , but most women have this fantasy of how this special day will take place			1
" now , if you 've got a partner that 's innately private and you go and do a public proposal and she feels pressured to say yes because everybody 's looking at her -- that 's not a good thing			1
" the wrong kind of obligation if only @entity186 's ex-fiance had been operating with such expert advice			1
he proposed while the couple was on holiday in @entity190 , only to break it off 10 days later			2
when she asked why he 'd proposed in the first place , he told her he 'd felt pressured to carry it out while they were on vacation			0
which begs the question : is planning a " destination proposal " all becoming a bit of an industry , something so expected that it 's no longer a surprise , even a bit @entity203 © ? @entity51 and @entity52 's romance had all the hallmarks of a fairy tale			1
they met in @entity120 while @entity52 was on a secondment from his @entity211 law firm and began dating casually			0
then , one day when they were running a half - marathon together , @entity52 suffered an aneurism and was rushed to the hospital in a coma			2
@entity51 kept vigil at his bedside and when he woke , they fell in love over a tray of bad hospital food			0
@entity51 eventually moved to @entity211 to be with @entity52 and expected a proposal would follow			2
" i was kind of expecting a destination proposal for a long time , " says @entity51			2
" every trip we went on -- @entity228 , @entity120 , @entity229 , @entity230 -- i was always like , ' oh , this is romantic ' waiting for the proposal that did n't come			2
" then they took a trip to @entity56 and it happened			0
while the moment was romantic -- let 's not forget the bubble she found herself in -- the story they tell these days is more about how that bubble was burst by a street vendor trying to sell them a rose			1
" that really brought us back into the commercial aspect of hanging out around the @entity55 in @entity56 , " says @entity51			0
perhaps @entity248 got the balance right when she proposed on a park bench during a coffee break from work			0
the big surprise here is not that she was a woman proposing to her boyfriend , but that it was a warm , sunny day in @entity211			1
" it was a beautiful day , so we went and had a coffee at our favorite coffee stand , " says @entity248			0
" we sat on a park bench under a beautiful apple tree			0
" i think i was overwhelmed by the weather and i thought , ' @entity263 , i 'm going to ask ! ' " i totally surprised myself			0
i had the shakes afterward			0
and he was like , ' yes ! yes , yes , yes , yes , yes			0
" ' did you get engaged while on vacation ? wish you had ? share your story in the comments section below .			2
