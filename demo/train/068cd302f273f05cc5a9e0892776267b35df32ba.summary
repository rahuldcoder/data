it remains unclear what , if anything , @entity5 's widow might have known or suspected , the source added			1
according to her attorney , @entity27 , the 24 - year - old widow knew nothing of plans to bomb the race , and reports of her husband 's involvement came as an " absolute shock " to @entity35 and her family			1
@entity5 and his younger brother , @entity38 , initially planned to carry out a suicide - bomb attack on july 4 , a @entity9 law enforcement official regularly briefed on the @entity41 bombing investigation told @entity0			1
the source said @entity43 told investigators their bombs were ready earlier than they expected and they decided to move up the date			1
@entity43 told investigators that the @entity3 was chosen as a target only a day or two before the event , the source said			2
it is unclear which specific event would have been targeted but one of the biggest july fourth celebrations in the country is held in @entity41			2
the annual @entity56 hosts 500,000 spectators , according to the event 's website			2
it is televised live nationally on @entity61			0
the revelation comes the same day the body of @entity5 was claimed by his family and later was picked up by a funeral home , according to @entity66 , spokesman for the @entity68 office of the chief medical examiner			1
@entity66 declined to say which funeral home picked it up			0
@entity5 's cause of death will not be released until the death certificate is filed with the @entity41 city clerk , he said			1
the earliest that 's expected to happen is friday morning , @entity66 said			2
his parents in @entity78 will not bring the bombing suspect 's body back to @entity81 and will not bury him until an " independent " autopsy is conducted , family spokeswoman @entity76 said friday			1
his body will be interred " somewhere in @entity41 , " she said			2
one item that may yield some clues into the bombings case is now in the hands of federal officials			0
the @entity90 has a laptop belonging to @entity43 , @entity5 's younger brother , two federal law enforcement officials told @entity0			1
the computer was turned over to investigators by one of his friends accused of obstructing justice			0

" he did n't say when the laptop was turned over			0

three people died and more than 260 were wounded when two explosive devices fashioned from pressure cookers and other materials exploded in separate locations near the finish line of the @entity3 on april 15			0
four people have been charged in connection with the bombing , including @entity43 , who is accused of carrying out the attack along with his brother , @entity5 , 26			1
the older brother died april 19 after a firefight with police , hours after authorities released images of the suspected bombers			0
@entity123 and @entity99 were charged wednesday with conspiring to discard potentially incriminating items from @entity38 's dorm room , including empty fireworks containers , while @entity127 was charged with making false statements to investigators			0
the @entity131 @entity130 said thursday it was offering consular services to @entity99 and @entity123 , who are citizens of that country and are in the @entity9 on student visas			0

he has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and could face the death penalty if convicted			0
authorities have said they believe the brothers acted alone , but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups , including groups overseas			0
of particular interest has been @entity5 's 2012 trip to the semi-autonomous @entity81 republic of @entity78 , home to numerous @entity167 militant groups that have warred against @entity169 's rule			1
@entity81 authorities asked @entity9 officials to investigate @entity172 some months before the trip , saying they believed he was becoming increasingly involved with radical @entity167			2
the @entity90 investigated , but found no evidence of extremist activity and closed the case			0
@entity9 officials learned after the bombings that @entity81 officials had intercepted a 2011 phone call between the suspect 's mother , living in @entity78 , and one of her sons in which they reportedly had a vague conversation about jihad , a law enforcement official told @entity0 earlier			1
some lawmakers , particularly @entity188 , have been critical of how law enforcement officials , intelligence agencies and the administration of president @entity192 handled the @entity81 tip. while @entity5 and his mother were added to a terror database following the @entity90 investigation , @entity5 was allowed to make his @entity81 trip in 2012 and return six months later			1
@entity0 's @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			2
