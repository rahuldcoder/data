@entity0 -- computer technicians have recovered about 22 million @entity6 administration e-mails that the @entity7 had said were missing , two watchdog groups that sued over the documents announced monday			1
the e-mails date from 2003 to 2005 , and had been " mislabeled and effectively lost , " according to the @entity9 , a research group based at @entity10			2
but @entity11 , executive director of the liberal - leaning @entity12 in @entity0 , said it could be years before most of the e-mails are made public			0
" the e-mails themselves are not what we 're getting , " @entity11 said			0
documents related to the handling of e-mail under the @entity6 administration and subsequent information regarding how @entity7 e-mails are currently archived will be released under a settlement with the @entity27 administration , which inherited a lawsuit the groups filed in 2007			1
but the @entity30 must sort out which documents are covered by the @entity32 and which ones fall under the @entity34 , which means they could be withheld for five to 10 years after the @entity6 administration left office in january , @entity11 said			1
" @entity36 will sort this out , " she said			0
the e-mail controversy dates back to the @entity6 administration 's 2006 firing of the top federal prosecutors in nine cities			1
after congressional committees demanded the administration produce documents related to the firings , the @entity7 said millions of e-mails might have been lost from its servers			1
@entity12 in @entity0 and the @entity9 sued over the issue in 2007 , arguing the @entity6 administration violated federal laws that require presidential records to be preserved			1
court records have shown that the @entity6 administration knew about the e-mail problems as far back as 2005 and did nothing to fix them , @entity11 said			1
" they never made an effort to restore them , " she said			0
but @entity59 , a former deputy press secretary in the @entity7 , said the group " has consistently tried to create a spooky conspiracy out of standard it issues			2
" " we always indicated that there is an e-mail archiving system and a disaster recovery system , " @entity59 said			0
" we also indicated that e-mails not properly archived could be found on disaster recovery tapes			0
there is a big , big difference between something not being properly archived and it being ' lost ' or ' missing , ' as @entity72 would say			0
" monday 's settlement allows for 94 days of e-mail traffic , scattered between january 2003 to april 2005 , to be restored from backup tapes			0
of those 94 days , 40 were picked by statistical sample ; another 21 days were suggested by the @entity7 ; and the groups that filed suit picked 33 that seemed " historically significant , " from the months before the invasion of @entity80 to the period when the firings of @entity84 attorneys were being planned			2
also requested were several days surrounding the announcement that a criminal investigation was under way into the disclosure of then - @entity91 agent @entity90 's identity			0
that investigation led to the conviction of @entity7 aide i. @entity94 on charges of perjury , obstruction of justice and lying to federal agents investigating the leak			2
@entity12 in @entity0 represented @entity100 and her husband , former @entity84 ambassador @entity100 , in a lawsuit over her exposure , which they argued was in retaliation for his accusation that the @entity6 administration over-hyped the intelligence used to justify the invasion of @entity80			1
a federal judge dismissed the case on procedural grounds in 2007 , but @entity11 said the missing e-mails raise the " strong possibility " that special prosecutor @entity116 never received all the documents he requested during the leak investigation .			2

@entity7 had said that about 22 million @entity6 administration e-mails were missing
e-mails involve @entity6 administration 's 2006 firing of top federal prosecutors
@entity7 said during congressional hearings they might have been lost
