-- " i do n't even know who the ' @entity2 ' are , " confesses @entity1 manager @entity0			1
" a lot of @entity6 come in and ask if we like that movie			2
i 've never seen it			2
" it 's really no wonder people ask			1
@entity0 and his partner , @entity12 , who often goes by @entity13 , share the names of the movie 's two main characters , played by @entity17 and @entity13			1
the sushi partners also wear bejeweled black fedoras , which seems like an updated , bedazzled @entity22 nod to the 1980s cult film and " @entity24 " sketch			1
affordable sushi whether their names and uniforms are intentional , @entity22 's very own @entity0 and @entity13 have amassed their own cult - like following among the city 's sushiphiles			1
the two versatile chefs , both hitting 30 this year , have been running @entity35 on @entity36 for nearly a year			2
while the seven - seater hole - in - the - wall is tiny , their love of bringing many customers high quality and affordable sushi is anything but miniature			1
" of course we want to make a profit , " admits @entity12 , who is head of sales and coordinates delivery with his @entity46 clientele			2
" but we 'd rather make money by giving a lot of people something for cheap than selling something really expensive to a select few			2
" with prices so low , we 've met so many different kinds of people throughout the year : students , tourists , local businessmen and the like			2
" prices are indeed wallet - friendly at @entity1			1
creative rolls start at the equivalent of about $ 3 @entity6 ( for the @entity65 ) and top out at $ 5.70 for the @entity66			0
the best deal : @entity68 @entity69 , a former staff member and current university freshman , is still a regular at the joint			0
" i help translate on the weekends with the @entity46 orders , " the 19 - year - old tells us while slurping on a $ 3 bowl of springy udon noodles with a delicately poached egg			0
" but since it 's summer , i 've been here more often , helping beginners navigate the menu			1
" she recommends the @entity83 ( $ 3.75 ) and @entity68 ( $ 4.20 )			0
the @entity83 is a fairly standard , though delicious , spicy tuna roll , pollock - splattered with a smoky spiced sauce			0
the @entity86 , @entity69 's favorite , " is the most economical , " she tells us			1
" it has tuna , salmon and flame - grilled eel			0
three fish in one roll for only ( $ 4.20 )			0
" you have to admire her way of thinking			0
other highlights other highlights on the menu include the @entity101 ( $ 5.25 ) , which @entity12 describes as " fruity and girlie			0
" believing his sincerity when he tells us how much he likes his foreign friends and patrons , one just hopes that the roll 's name is not an intentional slap in the face			1
@entity110 starts at $ 1.80 for three pieces of salmon or tuna , and soups begin at $ 3			0
even when grabbing a couple of $ 2.70 @entity117 or a few glasses of $ 3.75 @entity120 draft sake , diners will still walk out paying no more than $ 12 a head -- and incredibly full			0
if you 're not lucky enough to grab one of their coveted seven seats inside or two outdoors , they deliver and provide takeaway			0
with plans to eventually open another location , nobody expects that these sushi brothers will be singing the blues anytime soon .			1

@entity1 's @entity0 and @entity13 do n't give customers the blues
instead they offer high quality and affordable sushi
partners wear bejeweled black fedoras , say they have n't seen " @entity2 "
