-- hot , thirsty , frustrated and exhausted , @entity3 adventurers @entity1 and @entity4 were already feeling despair set in			1
at this early stage of their expedition to trek across the @entity12 's forbidding and desolate @entity13 , however , the pair had got no further than the wet sands of the @entity16 seaside town of @entity17			1
@entity1 had hit on the idea of dragging their 300 kilograms of water and supplies for the 45 - day 1,000 - mile ( 1,609 km ) expedition on a homemade steel cart , but as the pair labored to heave the heavily laden cart through the boggy sands of @entity17 on a test run , doubts were starting to set in			1
" the purest way to have done the trip would have been camels but we could n't afford it , so that ruled that out , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" i liked the aspect of the cart because it made it a physical challenge which appeals to me			2

with no steering mechanism , the wrong sized wheels and a fundamentally flawed design , just six weeks later the pair flat - packed the conveyance to begin the long walk from @entity52 in @entity53 to @entity54 in the @entity55			0
undaunted , @entity1 and @entity4 undertook the arduous journey with a budget of just Â £ 2,000 ( $ 3,270 ) and made modifications to the cart on the road			2
" i think it was a good demonstration that the main thing is to get out there and make stuff happen , " he said			0
" we could have spent a whole year in the @entity3 to get sponsorship for some carbon fiber cart and we still would n't have done the trip			1
" if nothing , he said , the cart added to the comedy value of his film " into the @entity13 " , which was released last month			1
in the footsteps of @entity74 the aim of the expedition was to retrace the footsteps of one of the legends of desert exploration , @entity3 adventurer @entity74 , who in the 1940s on two separate trips charted vast tracts of the @entity13 -- or @entity13 as it is known in @entity85 -- a sea of sand dunes and flat featureless plains that spans modern day @entity53 , @entity89 and @entity39			1
in his book " @entity91 " @entity74 wrote about his time in the @entity13 traveling with the tribal @entity93 ; tough men who lived by a desert code of honor , vengeance and intense loyalty			1

a changed landscape @entity1 -- who could only follow part of @entity74 's journey in the @entity13 because they did not have visa access to @entity39 - says the legendary explorer would not recognize the area today with its roads , oil installations and , at one point , even hamburger and kebab stands			1
" right from the start we were clear that were n't trying to exactly replicate his route -- it was purely a journey inspired by @entity74 , " @entity1 said			2
" if we 'd really wanted to retrace his footsteps we would have ended the journey in @entity130 rather than @entity54 but we chose @entity54 because it seemed like the complete antithesis of everything @entity74 appreciated about the desert and it really epitomizes the total transformation of that part of the world in the last 70 years			2
" nevertheless , he says the pristine and crystalline beauty of the desert remains			0
" i 've been to quite a lot empty places and earlier that year i 'd rowed across the @entity141 which sounds , on the surface , like two very different experiences but the two were actually very similar			0
read more : @entity146 , @entity147 or @entity130 ? " we were a tiny bubble of life with all of our life -- food and water -- in this cart and our lives depended on our cart and each other			0
" the landscape of the desert and the ocean seemed to me be on pause ; they were completely unchanged for millions of years			0
it 's a huge contrast to most of the environments we 're used to in daily life which have been molded by mankind			0
" in the desert , i felt that once we moved camp in the morning and our noise had moved on then that spot would be silent for thousands more years			0
" people of the desert like @entity74 , the micro-adventurers -- as @entity1 and @entity4 like to call themselves -- said the landscape was made up of people as much as it was by sand dunes and harsh rocky plains			1
" the locals we met were quite possibly the kindest , friendliest and most welcoming people i 've ever met in the whole world -- they were just unbelievably generous -- but they thought what we were doing was completely crazy , " @entity1 says			0
as passers - by stopped to take cell phone pictures , give them food or even sometimes press cash on the weary travelers , he said that contact with people on the ground confounded many of the negative stereotypes of the @entity194			0
" it was very safe , " @entity1 said			0
" before i went a lot of people were thinking " oh you 're going to the @entity194 you 'll definitely be killed by @entity200 terrorists " but it was so much safer than even the @entity3			2
" ultimately , he said they left with a deep respect for the people of the region some of whom were descended from the type of people that may have traveled with @entity74			2
" only three generations might separate these people from the ones who accompanied @entity74 -- and they might get around now in air - conditioned suvs -- but they have n't been removed from the desert long enough to think that going out into it and having a miserable time is a good idea			1
" they thought we were complete idiots			0

two @entity3 adventurers attempted to cross the @entity13 of the @entity12
