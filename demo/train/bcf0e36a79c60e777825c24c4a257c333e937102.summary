there is a new scandal breaking involving an elected official , a young woman and @entity4			0
and , nope , it 's not what you think			0
this one involves 18 - year - old @entity10 high school senior @entity9 , who was on a school trip last week to the @entity12 as part of the @entity14			2
on her way back from the event , she jokingly tweeted to her then - 65 followers on @entity4 the following about @entity10 gov. @entity18 : " just made mean comments at gov. brownback and told him he sucked , in person # heblowsalot			1
" when you tweet to 65 people on @entity4 , it usually just ends there , quickly evaporating into the cybersphere -- tweets are truly the epitome of ephemeral			0
that is unless you happen to tweet about the governor of @entity10			2
in a move that would have undoubtedly impressed @entity31 , the @entity10 governor 's director of communication , @entity33 , is charged with the daily monitoring of any negative comments about @entity18 on social - media websites			1
@entity37 , finding this 73 - character tweet by a high school student a threat to the good name of the governor , bolted into action			2
she contacted the @entity14 in @entity46 organizers and expressed her outrage over the tweet			0
in turn , the event administrators , no doubt concerned that the governor 's director of communication had taken the time to contact them , informed @entity9 's high school principal			1
@entity9 soon found herself in her principal 's office being scolded for nearly an hour			1
bottom line : the principal has mandated the student write a letter of apology to the governor that is due monday			2
@entity9 , who says she was making a political comment on @entity18 's conservative policies that she disagrees with , announced her refusal to apologize for criticizing the governor			1
see an interview with @entity9 to me , there are a few issues that quickly jump out : who else has the governor confronted for making negative remarks about him ? recent polls indicate that @entity18 has a 52 % disapproval rating -- with a majority of @entity10 residents unhappy with his work			1
responding to these type of tweets could become a full - time job			0
is the governor spending taxpayer dollars to monitor his critics on social media ? which websites does his office monitor ? obviously @entity4 , but what about @entity90 and @entity91 ? what about @entity93 or @entity94 ? you never know -- someone stuck in 2007 could still be using those websites and making disparaging remarks about @entity18			1
why is it that a conservative such as @entity18 -- who generally opposes government regulations -- wants to regulate free speech ? is there an exception to his philosophy of less government when it is a regulation he likes ? can @entity18 demand an apology from me because i tweeted this : " rep governor @entity18 of @entity10 demands that teen apologize for tweeting he sucks			1
# @entity112 " -- and because i 'm one of the people who boosted @entity9 's @entity4 follower count to more than 7,000 since this story broke ? but the biggest question to me : does the @entity117 apply in @entity10 ? the message of @entity18 's office and of the high school principal is alarmingly clear : if you criticize the governor , you could suffer consequences			1
that is something you hear about in a third world nation that does not guarantee freedom of speech , not the @entity128			0
we need to be especially vigilant in protecting freedom of speech when it involves commenting on the actions of our elected officials			0
that is one of the cornerstones of our democracy			0
having to apologize to an elected official for criticizing him or her , however , undermines our nation by creating a chilling effect on free speech			1
@entity18 did announce this afternoon : " my staff over-reacted to this tweet , and for that i apologize			2
" governor apologizes for ' overreaction ' he should be applauded for that			0
it sends an unequivocal message that criticism of our elected officials must not be limited in any way , and in fact , should be encouraged -- especially by the younger generation of @entity128 learning about our government			0
however , it is still troubling that state funds are used to monitor social media websites to determine if anyone is mocking the governor			0
it has an eerie @entity164 feel , not to mention that it 's a waste of tax payer dollars			0
@entity18 should end that practice today , making his focus solely the issues facing all the residents of @entity10 -- not whether he 's popular on @entity90 and @entity4 .			1

@entity10 student tweeted her disapproval of gov. @entity18
governor 's office *objected* , and the student 's principal told her to apologize
@entity180 : governor 's office impinged on free speech
he says governor apologized , now he needs to stop monitoring social sites
