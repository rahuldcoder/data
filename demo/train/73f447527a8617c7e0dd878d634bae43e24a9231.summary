@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the ' 90s a certain joke became very popular in the streets and homes of @entity1			1
it began with @entity7 -- the mischievous boy of our national humor -- and told how his teacher , brandishing a photo of the @entity13 president , launches into a harsh diatribe against him			1
" the man you see here is the cause of all our problems , he has plunged this island into shortages and destroyed our productivity , he is responsible for the lack of food and the collapse of public transport , " the teacher says			0
after these fierce accusations the teacher points to the face in the photo and asks her most wayward student , " do you know who this is ? " smiling , @entity7 replies , " oh yes , ... i know him , it 's just that without his beard i did n't recognize him			2
" photos : @entity1 -- a sense of home in a timeless place the joke reflects , to a large measure , the polarization of national opinion with regard to our economic difficulties and the restrictions on citizens ' rights that characterize the current @entity1 system			1
while the official discourse points to the @entity13 as the source of our greatest problems , many others see the @entity61 itself as the root of all the failures of the last 53 years			1
true or not , the reality is that each one of the 11 administrations that have passed through the @entity66 since 1959 has influenced the course of this island , sometimes directly , other times as a pillar of support for the ideological propaganda of @entity74 's government ( and now that of his younger brother @entity75 )			1
hence the growing expectations that circulate through the largest of the @entity78 every time elections come around to decide who will sit in the @entity80			2
@entity1 politics depends so greatly on what happens in the ballot boxes on the other side of the @entity85 -- and some share the view that we have never been so dependent on our neighbor to the north			1
postcard : why @entity92 longs for @entity13 election @entity1 diplomacy seems more comfortable contradicting @entity13 than seeking to solve the problems between the nations , which is why many analysts agree it would be easier for @entity99 to cope with an aggressive policy from @entity101 than with the more pragmatic approach of @entity103			1
@entity103 's easing of the rules on family remittances , reestablishing academic travel , and increasing cultural exchanges add up to an unwieldy formula difficult for the @entity74 regime 's rhetoric to manage			1
but the regime has also tried to wring economic and political advantages from these gestures from @entity115			2
the real question in this dispute is which approach would more greatly affect democratization in @entity1 -- to display a fist ? or to offer a hand ? to recognize the legitimacy of the government on the island ? or to continue to treat it as a kidnapper holding power over 11 million hostages ? postcard : can @entity130 learn from election " matsuri ? " when the @entity136 party , led by @entity103 , came to the @entity66 in january 2009 , our official press was faced with a dilemma			1
on the one hand the newly elected president 's youth and his @entity141 descent made him immediately popular with @entity1 , and it was not uncommon to find people walking the streets wearing a shirt or hat displaying the face of the former senator from @entity150			1
it was the first time in decades that some compatriots dared to publicly wear a picture of the " enemy " ( the @entity13 president ) himself			1
for a population that saw the top leaders of our own government approaching or passing 80 , the image of a cheerful , limber , smiling @entity103 was more consistent with the myth of the @entity162 than were the old men in olive green standing behind the national microphones			0
@entity103 's magnetism also captivated many here as well , and disappointed , of course , those who hoped for a heavier hand toward the gerontocracy in @entity0			2
farewell socialism ... hello to pragmatism beyond the political issues , the measures undertaken by the @entity103 administration were felt quickly in many @entity1 families , particularly in their economy and relations with their exiled relatives in @entity13			1
with the increased cash from remittances , the small businesses that emerged from @entity99 's reforms were able to use the money coming from the north for start - up capital and to position themselves			0
meanwhile , thousands of @entity189 arrived at @entity191 airport every week loaded with packages , medicine and clothes to support their relatives on the island			0
those who see the @entity1 situation as a pressure cooker that needs just a little more heat to explode feel defrauded by these " concessions " to @entity0 from the @entity136 government			2
they are the same people who suggest that a hard line -- belligerence on the diplomatic scene and economic suffocation -- would deliver better results			0
sadly , however , the guinea pigs required to test the efficacy of such an experiment would be @entity1 on the island , physically and socially wasting away until some point at which our civic consciousness would supposedly " wake up			2
" as if there are not enough historical examples to show that totalitarian regimes become stronger as their economic crises deepen and international opinion turns against them			0
no wonder @entity225 is a much talked about figure in the official @entity1 press			2
his strong confrontational positions feed the anti-imperialism discourse like fuel to a fire			0
the @entity233 candidate has been the focus of numerous articles in the official organ of the @entity237 , the newspaper @entity238			0
his photos and caricatures appear in this same daily that was stymied when trying to physically mock @entity103			0
given the high rate of mixed marriages among @entity1 , it 's quite sensitive to enlarge the ears and fatten the lips of the @entity13 president without it reading as racist ridicule			1
postcard : @entity251 marvel at @entity103 's " coolitude " if , in the eighties , the media 's political humor was honed in the wrinkled face of @entity257 , and later the media had a field day with the physique of @entity261 , for four years it has been cautious with the current resident of the @entity66			1
all this graphic moderation will go by the wayside if @entity225 is elected as the next president of the @entity13			2
there are those who are already laughing over the possible jokes to come			0
but whoever scores the electoral victory will find @entity1 in a state of change			1
the reforms carried out by @entity99 lack the speed and depth most people desire , but are heading in the irreversible direction of economic opening			0
@entity0 is full of private cafés and restaurants , we can now buy and sell homes , and @entity1 are even managing to sell the cars given to them during the era of @entity285 subsidies in exchange for political loyalty			2
the timid changes driven by the general president are threatening to damage the fundamental pillars of @entity74 's command			1
volunteerism at any cost , coarse egalitarianism , active adventures abroad , and a country kept in a state of constant tension by the latest economic or political campaign appear to be gradually fading into things of the past			0
on the other hand , citizens themselves have begun to experience the most definitive of transformations , that which occurs within			0
public criticism is on the rise , although it has not yet found ways to be heard in all its diversity , but every day the fear of police reprisals diminishes			0
more : @entity1 disputes reports of jailed @entity13 's health the official media have unquestionably lost a monopoly on the flow of information and thanks to illegal satellite dishes @entity321 television now comes to @entity1			1
alternative news networks circulate documentaries , films , and articles from independent journalists and bloggers			0
it 's as if the enormous ocean liner of @entity162 censorship was taking on water through every porthole			0
young people are finally pushing to have internet access , while the retired complain about their miserable pensions and almost everyone disagrees with the travel restrictions that prevent our leaving and returning to our own country			0
in short , the illusion of unanimity has fallen to pieces in @entity99 's hands			0
more : @entity99 's daughter endorses @entity103 to this internal scenario , the result of the @entity13 elections could be a catalyst or obstacle for changes , but it is no longer the most important factor to consider			1
although the billboards lining the streets continue to paint the @entity13 as @entity358 wanting to crush little @entity359 who represents our island , for an increasing number of people the metaphor does n't play out that way			2
they know that in our case the abusive giant is a government that tries to control the smallest aspects of our national life , while his opponent is a people who , bit by bit , is becoming more conscious of its real stature .			0

while @entity74 regime blames @entity13 for @entity1 's ills , many @entity1 blame regime
@entity384 : @entity1 politics depends greatly on @entity13 presidential elections
@entity384 : whoever wins the race to the @entity66 will find @entity1 in a state of change
