-- a picture is worth a thousand words -- but for @entity4 , those words were n't worth remembering			1
when she was forced to pose for photos at her niece 's sweet 16 party in 2008 , she realized just how overweight she really was			0
if she did n't make a drastic change , she knew she would n't live to see future family milestones			2
at the time , she weighed in at 403 pounds			1
because of her body size , she struggled throughout everyday life			2
she could n't walk more than a few steps in her own home , get out of a car or fit in airplane seats			2
" i swear , every beat of my heart hurt , " @entity4 says			1
" any moment could be my last , and i felt one morning i simply would not wake up			0
" @entity4 grew up in a large family where every occasion centered around food			1
every birthday , anniversary , graduation or accomplishment was an excuse to consume authentic @entity31 food			0
she wanted to be a role model for her daughter , @entity33 , now 18 , but says it was difficult enforcing a healthy diet when she was n't following one herself			2
when @entity33 had parent - teacher days at school , @entity4 refused to attend because she did n't want to embarrass her daughter by being " the fat mom			1
" " when you are that large and that miserable in your body , you feel like you 're a failure to your children , your parents and society , " @entity4 says			1
doctors told her the only way to lose enough weight to be at a healthy @entity48 was through gastric bypass surgery			1
her friends constantly told her she would n't be successful if she did n't get professional help			2
@entity4 says she considered both , but ultimately she wanted to shed the pounds on her own naturally			1
" i felt just from watching surgery - goers , their body changed , but they were n't all that healthy , " @entity4 says			1
" they could continue to eat the junk , just not as much			0
" in the past , she had tried almost every single diet fad known			0
" either i failed them , or they failed me , i just do n't know , " @entity4 says			1
so she decided to look at weight loss as a challenge to her doctors and herself , not as punishment			2
days after seeing pictures from the birthday party , @entity4 sat down and formed an eating plan			1
she took elements of other diets and her knowledge from nutrition classes she took in college and created her own diet plan			0
lean meats and fish , fresh fruits and vegetables , kind bars and unlimited water are essentials during the day			0
@entity4 says she did n't want to feel deprived as she did in other diets -- she wanted a way to eat cleaner and feel full at the same time			1
" i love cooking and entertaining , " @entity4 says			1
" i needed to find a way to cook my favorite foods healthier , not cut them out entirely			0
" she says exercising was a challenge in the beginning , but starting slow allowed her to keep realistic goals			0
" the first day of exercising resulted in me breaking a " @entity90 " machine because i exceeded the weight limit , " @entity4 says			2
so she steered clear of the gym to avoid being ridiculed by strangers			0
" it 's not about investing in supplements , gym memberships , programs or diet plans , " she says			0
" for me it was about investing in myself , my health , my mind and my body			0
" in two years , @entity4 has shed a total of 289 pounds			1
she now weighs 114 pounds			2
she says looking back at pictures , she can see the sadness in her eyes			0
the smile on her face was a facade to hide from how she truly felt about her body			0
" @entity110 is knowing that i am the best i can be in every way , " she says			0
" and now i 'm no longer an observer of life , but a participant			1
" have you lost weight ? share your story on @entity117			0
