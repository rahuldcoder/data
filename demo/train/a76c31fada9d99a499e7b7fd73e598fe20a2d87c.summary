@entity0 , @entity1 -- the federal government has set aside nearly $ 2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up @entity1 's decommissioned @entity0 nuclear site , once the center of the country 's @entity8 plutonium production			1
that is more stimulus funding than some entire states have received , which has triggered a debate as to whether the money is being properly spent			1
the facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south - central @entity1 , an area roughly half the size of @entity17			2
it was built in the 1940s as part of the " @entity21 " to develop the first atomic weapon during @entity23 millions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of @entity26 where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built			2
during the @entity8 , @entity28 was a buzzing hive of activity , eventually becoming the main source of plutonium production for the nation 's nuclear weapons program			2
decades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned @entity0 the notorious distinction of being most contaminated nuclear site in the @entity38			1
today , the @entity0 site is a virtual ghost town and those involved in the clean - up project say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds			1
there are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater , hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down , and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge			0
the stimulus money will reduce the clean - up time by years , according to @entity55 , who oversees the federal project at @entity0			1
" it was perfect work , ready to go for the stimulus package , " @entity55 said			0
" each day that passes the conditions worsen [ and ] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the clean up footprint much sooner , years sooner			2
" the money is also created jobs for about 1,400 people at @entity0 , including @entity70 who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation			1
despite the dangers of his job , @entity74 said it came just at the right time			0
" i had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world , [ i ] thought i 'd be there for 20 years , " @entity74 said			0
" we laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant , [ and ] those jobs are n't jobs you just read the paper and get			0
" it is clear by watching @entity74 's team perform their time - consuming daily tasks that @entity0 wo n't be decontanimated quickly			2
the workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear			0
they break down contaminated equipment through a " glove box , " allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead - lined gloves			0
each time a worker removes their hands from the gloves , they must be wanded down by a colleague checking for any radiation exposure			0
the large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at @entity0			1
a report by sens. @entity118 , @entity119 , and @entity120 , @entity121 , listed @entity0 as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted			1
the @entity0 clean - up " has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress , " according to the report			1
@entity128 , who runs a @entity0 watchdog organization , says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste			1
but he questions whether the funds are going where they are most needed			0
" you are not seeing the value that we should be seeing for the clean - up and the environment , " said @entity128 , who heads @entity136			0
" they are picking the low - hanging fruit , the easy projects that give very nice photo opportunities			0
but that does n't cost $ 2 billion			1
" @entity0 is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds and you would expect to see real progress for clean - up [ to ] happen with those dollars			1
" while debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used , the @entity155 area that surrounds the @entity0 -- which includes @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 -- is reaping the benefits of the clean - up boom			1
@entity28 began receiving stimulus dollars in march 2009 , which helped the surrounding cities and towns avoid the catastrophe that has plagued other communities impacted by the recent economic downturn			0
the @entity155 area has one of the lowest unemployment rates in @entity1 , and the housing market has barely been affected by the recent economic downturn , according to the @entity155 industrial development council			2
@entity174 , who owns a local office furniture store , said his business was " at a standstill " last year before the orders from @entity0 contractors started pouring in			2
@entity174 had to hire six temporary workers , two of which he may keep on full time , to deal with the boom in business			0
" we are on track to have best year ever , " @entity174 said			0
his business has been in his family for three generations and will likely stay profitable for several more generations since the @entity0 clean - up project is expected to take another 40 years			1
" it has my manufacturers raising their eyebrows saying , ' wow how does that guy do that ? ' "			0
