a former top @entity1 commander in @entity2 was ordered thursday to pay thousands of dollars but avoided prison time in a case that put a spotlight on the military 's handling of sexual misconduct among troops			1
gen. @entity11 was told he 'd get a reprimand , and he must forfeit $ 20,000 and pay restitution of $ 4,157 related to travel fraud charges , his lawyer , @entity15 , said			1
@entity11 's court - martial came at a time when many have accused the military of not doing enough to address sex crimes and harassment targeting women			1
the sentence was handed down days after @entity11 pleaded guilty to adultery and mistreating one of his accusers in a deal that saw the sexual assault and sodomy charges against him dropped , according to @entity11 's defense team			1
he had previously pleaded guilty to other charges in the court - martial , including committing adultery , engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women , conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman , and obstruction of justice			1
prosecutors said @entity11 broke military law through sexual relationships -- including threats to some women involved who held lower ranks -- between 2009 and 2012 in @entity48 , @entity2 and @entity49 , as well as @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52 , @entity53			1
once the deputy commander of the @entity57 's @entity56 , @entity11 was moved to the @entity51 post from @entity2 in 2012 , the same year the last alleged incidents occurred and when he was originally charged			1
opinion : military justice bungles sex cases after he left thursday 's hearing at @entity50 , @entity11 said he was glad " the system worked			1
" " all i want to do now is go up north and hug my kids and see my wife , " he said			2
@entity15 said that he , too , was " very , very grateful " for how everything played out			2
he added that @entity11 plans to file his retirement papers with the @entity57			1
" it restores our faith in the system , " @entity15 said of the outcome , repeating his assertion that " we would not be here at all " if the same allegations were leveled in the civilian justice system			1
" somebody who is neutral and objective looked at the evidence ( and ) did the right thing			0
" retired rear adm. @entity81 , a partner with a law firm that represented one of @entity11 's accusers , called thursday 's sentencing a " slap on the wrist " that is " beyond disappointing			1
it is a travesty and a serious misstep for the @entity57			2
" he said the ordeal shows remaining " challenges " in the military when it comes to sexual abuse and assault			0
" she had her day in court to speak the truth about the horrible things he did , and based on @entity105 ( @entity104 ) @entity103 's sentence , that will have to be enough , " @entity81 said of his client			2
" but it should n't be			0
" the testimony of his client , an @entity57 captain , was never fully aired			0
she testified for several hours on march 7 , telling the court that an affair started with intimate exchanges and evolved into groping and demands for sex and oral sex , @entity110 affiliate @entity109 reported			0
she also said the general threatened to kill her and her family , the station reported			2
the woman was scheduled to continue her testimony on march 10 , but @entity103 dismissed the jury after 22 pages of e-mails emerged that appear to point to alleged @entity130 interference in the case			0
at least one of the e-mails also seemed to indicate that a senior @entity57 official felt the accuser had a credibility issue			0
a recent @entity130 report showed that there were estimated to be 26,000 incidents of sexual assault and unwanted sexual contact in 2012 , and just over 10 % of those were reported			0
these concerns fueled a push championed by sen. @entity145 , a @entity147 @entity146 , for legislation to remove military commanders from deciding whether most serious allegations of wrongdoing by their subordinates should be prosecuted			0
the responsibility would have been shifted to prosecutors outside the chain of command			0
opponents said that such a measure would undermine the critical military principle of command authority			0
earlier this month , @entity145 's bill failed to get the needed 60 votes to pass the @entity163			1
however , a separate measure to largely disallow the " good soldier " defense -- which permits defendants to enter evidence of their good military character at trial to mitigate the charges against them -- did make it through the chamber			2
political fight over military sex assaults divides female senators			0

@entity11 must forfeit $ 20,000 in pay , get a reprimand , pay over $ 4,000 for travel fraud
the *brigadier* general says afterward that " the system worked "
he 'd earlier pleaded guilty to some charges ; others including sodomy were dropped
@entity191 's lawyer says @entity11 's " slap on the wrist " is " a travesty "
