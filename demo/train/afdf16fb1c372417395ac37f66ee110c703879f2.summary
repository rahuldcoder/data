two thirds of the world population does not have internet access			1
@entity3 already has more than a billion users on its service , but before it can sign up the rest of world it needs to get them online			1
the social media company announced a new step in its ambitious plan to bring affordable , basic internet access to " every person in the world			1
" @entity3 's new @entity13 will research and test experimental technology including drones , satellites and lasers to spread the reach of the internet to isolated locations that currently do not have @entity19			1
" we 've been working on ways to beam @entity19 to people from the sky , " said ceo @entity21 in a post announcing the new effort			2
last year , @entity3 announced @entity28 , a coalition of major tech companies working together to lower barriers to internet access using more traditional methods , such as making it cheaper to get @entity19 on cell phones			1
those efforts have been responsible for getting 3 million more people online , according to @entity21			2
this new initiative focuses on experimenting with new technology			2
the group is working with drones that can stay in the air for months at a time , bringing @entity19 connections to suburban areas			2
in more rural spots , satellites will be tested as a way to beam connections to the people on the ground			0
the group will attempt to make speedier long distance connections using invisible infrared laser beams			1
the developers who keep redesigning your @entity3 news feed will not be dabbling in satellites and drones			1
@entity3 has brought on aerospace experts from @entity60 and the team who built the @entity64 solar - powered drone			1
internet access is a cause major technology companies can easily get behind			0
it 's a smart business investment that doubles as a charitable cause			0
@entity69 announced plans to tackle the issue last summer with its own ambitious @entity72			0
instead of drones , the company is testing giant balloons that travel in the earth 's stratosphere for 100 days at a time			1
using specialized antennas , the balloons will deliver @entity19 at @entity80			0
both companies frame their plans to bring the internet to the entire world as altruistic , not as a land grab			1
@entity87 chairman @entity86 dismissed some of these efforts in an interview with @entity91 in 2013 , saying " when a kid gets diarrhea , no , there 's no website that relieves that			0
" in many of the world 's most remote areas , poverty is a more pressing concern than internet connectivity			1
people can not afford electricity or clean water , let alone phones			0
however , humanitarian organizations have been pushing for more access in these remote areas to improve the efficiency of aid work			0
for example , it would make it easier to set up remote health care stations in situations where the nearest doctors or hospitals are hours or days away			0
in countries where the @entity19 is already more widespread , unfettered access allows for freedom of speech and expression			0
so much so that the @entity123 declared access to the @entity19 a basic human right in 2011			0
governments can still censor or filter access to control what information is disseminated , as the @entity130 government is doing with its recent attempts to block @entity132 and @entity133			0
for now , the @entity13 is focusing on the technical challenges of delivering the internet to geographically tricky spots			2
eventually , low cost internet and cell phone use could spread to the populations in these areas and when it does , maybe they 'll sign up for @entity3 .			2

@entity3 is working on new technology to get the entire world 's population online
it 's new @entity13 is testing drones , satellites and invisible infrared laser beams
the company has hired aerospace experts from @entity60 and drone company
