-- after half a century of hits , addictions , mayhem and enough bad blood to flood the @entity6 , the @entity1 have gotten it together just in time to celebrate their latest anniversary onstage			2
" to keep a band together this long , let alone a rock ' n ' roll band , is probably unique in musical history , " says @entity10			1
" after all , that 's what i was born for : to make musical history			1
" what the @entity1 have announced so far is not quite a tour : they 're playing four shows this year , on november 25th and 29th at @entity22 's @entity21 , and on december 13th and 15th at the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25			1
but @entity26 doubts they 'll end there			2
" my experience with the @entity1 , " he says , " is that once the juggernaut starts rolling , it ai n't gon na stop			1
so without sort of saying definitely yes -- yeah			2
we ai n't doing all this for four gigs ! " rare and @entity37 the @entity1 expect former guitarist @entity38 ( who quit in 1974 ) and founding bassist @entity39 ( gone since ' 93 ) to come on board for the four shows , but only as guests on a few songs			1
@entity26 emphasizes that longtime touring bassist @entity43 is n't going anywhere			1
" @entity43 does n't get enough recognition , " says @entity26			1
" he and @entity39 can talk about songs they want to step in and out of			2
" for the final show in @entity24 ( to be broadcast live on pay - per - view ) , more guests are likely to pop by -- @entity51 drops names like @entity53 and @entity54 as possibilities			1
the band shrugs off grumbling about the $ 800 - plus it 's charging for the best tickets			1
" as @entity10 said , ' sounds about right , ' " says @entity51			1
" i 'd pay it ! we already spent , like , a million on rehearsing , and we 're not even halfway through			0
and the stage is going to cost millions and millions			0
" the @entity1 also have a new career - spanning documentary , " @entity66 , " directed by @entity67 , that debuts on @entity65 on november 15th			1
in less than two hours , the film races through history from the band 's earliest shows at the @entity72 to the arrival of @entity51 , keeping a relatively light tone throughout			1
" i never wanted to make a nostalgic movie , " says @entity75			0
" it 's got to be kind of irreverent			1
" one prerequisite for the @entity1 ' reunion was an apology from @entity26 to @entity75 for the stream of insults the guitarist included in " life , " his bestselling 2011 memoir			0
" he did apologize , to my face , " says @entity75 quietly			0
" so you have to put all that sort of stuff away			0
water under the bridge , really			0
hopefully , you know , we can carry on working			0
" adds @entity26 , " it was something to get out of the bloody way so we could get the band on the road			1
you know , i 'll say sorry to @entity101 if you like			0
i do n't give a shit			1
i said , ' look forward , brother , look forward			0
' if you was married to somebody for 50 years , you can have your little spats here and there , and we do n't mind having them in public occasionally			1
we ca n't get divorced -- we 're doing it for the kids ! " the @entity1 ' album guide : the @entity114 , the @entity115 and the ' @entity116 ' " @entity117 , " the newly recorded single from the band 's latest greatest - hits collection , " @entity122 ! , " sounds more or less like classic stones , albeit with modern production tweaks			1
but that does n't mean that @entity75 and @entity26 have revived their songwriting partnership quite yet			1
the song began as a demo that @entity75 made on his own , and even the opening guitar riff turns out to be @entity75 playing , not @entity26			0
" i do n't give a damn , " says @entity26			1
" he 'd never have learned how to play that without me teaching him how to do it			0
" another factor in the long hiatus since the 2007 finale of the @entity138 tour was @entity51 's struggle with alcohol addiction			1
he 's now in his third year of sobriety , and he expects to keep it up on the road , though previous tours were always a challenge			1
" looking back , " says @entity51 , " there was always that secret vodka , like the one before i 'd go onstage			0
which was never just one , anyway			0
" @entity26 is also drinking significantly less			0
" i do n't get ridiculous , " he says			1
" i like a glass of wine with my meal and everything , but i 've given up sort of waking up and having a drink , you know ? i gave up smack , i can give up anything			0
no big deal to me , i do it to impress other people			0
but if they come up with a great new drug , i 'll be the first one on it , believe me			0
" @entity26 argues that his substance use , or lack thereof , has little effect on his playing , but @entity51 disagrees			0
" @entity10 is a pleasure to play with now , " @entity51 says			1
" it was a pain on the last tour toward the end , because he was really going for it on the drinking and denial			1
but now he 's realized that he has got ta look after himself			2
" since @entity26 is n't completely sober , @entity51 is inclined to keep an eye on him			2
" i 'm not going to preach to him , " he says			0
" i will step in if i see any danger			0
" the @entity1 seem genuinely excited about their recent rehearsals in @entity178 , which have included rarely played songs such as the @entity180 - penned " @entity182 " and the @entity184 ballad " @entity181			2
" " going in , one thinks , ' oh , my @entity185 , i 'm a doddering old man , ' " says @entity26			0
" but it 's not true ! the payoff from the energy that 's been wound up over the five years is incredible			2
" for @entity75 , performing with the @entity1 means living up to a reputation as an ageless physical marvel , which he insists is highly exaggerated			0
@entity1 confirm 50th @entity192 concerts " everyone 's human , " he says , " and you ca n't really expect it to last forever			1
on the other hand , you try to keep yourself in shape			0
obviously you ca n't do the same things [ onstage ] you did when you were 19 , so you have to do other things			2
there 's no miracles in life			2
" but he knows that fans expect him to somehow be an exception : " it 's a bit of a burden , really , is n't it ? i better be ok , at least			1
" if anything , the physical burden is even harder on 71 - year - old @entity215 , who has a masseuse on hand for his back after every rehearsal			2
" it takes a heavy toll playing them drums , " says @entity51 , " to make it look like he 's doing nothing , and to make it sound like those firecrackers going off			2
it all goes to his back , you know ? he suffers terribly			0
" the @entity1 are bracing themselves to be asked yet again if this could be the last time			0
but even if it was , they 'd never tell you			0
" that 's not a card , in my opinion , that should be played , " says @entity75 , who says he 'd like to record another @entity1 album eventually			2
" i know lots of people do play that card , but it nearly always backfires on them			0
" it 's not lost on the @entity1 that they wo n't be alone on the road this winter , with so many of their peers -- @entity245 , the who and @entity246 , to name a few -- also playing to huge audiences at this very late date			1
" what can you say ? " @entity26 says			0
" it 's a hell of a generation			2
