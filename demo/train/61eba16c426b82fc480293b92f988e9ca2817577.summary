more than a decade after that dreadful day , 9/11 memories are still fresh for me			2
the intense , flesh - cutting urgency of the pain has diminished			0
i am no longer a grieving mother			0
i have learned to live with the loss of my son , @entity5			1
but i am still waiting for justice			0
what i want is not complicated -- a recognition that , when @entity10 died beneath the rubble that day , he died as a first responder			1
his name should be reflected that way at the @entity15 , properly listed among the other first responders who rushed bravely toward the flames			1
on that terrible day , my husband @entity18 and i could not know where @entity10 was			1
nor could his brothers , @entity21 and @entity22 , know what had become of their @entity24 , the @entity26 word for a beloved and revered elder brother			0
as anyone who lost a loved one on 9/11 knows , that uncertainty was cruel and crushing			2
we could n't know it then , but what had happened to @entity10 that morning , along with the events of the following months , changed everything for our family , bringing unbearable pain into our lives and suddenly making us public persons			1
in the months before 9/11 , @entity10 had served as a cadet in the @entity41			1
he was also a trained emergency technician			0
at the time of his death , he was working as a lab analyst at @entity46 's @entity45 , on @entity48 's @entity47			2
he was working there because it was a path toward becoming a doctor			0
@entity10 was determined to keep trying to get into medical school			1
if he could n't , he planned to join the @entity41 and work toward becoming a detective , using his scientific skills			0
it was a momentous time of decision in his life			0
opinion : after 9/11 , how we honored our son 's memory on that crisp and glorious morning , i drove away from our home in @entity64 , @entity65			1
i dropped off @entity22 at @entity66 , then continued on to @entity67 & count @entity68 72 , where i taught @entity70			0
when @entity22 and i left the house , at about 7:15 , @entity10 was still sleeping			1
he had been up much of the evening , first polishing up his medical school application , then providing medical care to his father , who was feeling ill. finally , @entity10 went up to bed at 3 a.m. in the bedroom he shared with @entity22			1
after @entity22 and i had left , @entity10 would have pursued his usual routine , catching a bus and then the 7 train to @entity48			2
as we have since deduced , he must have seen the flames at the @entity82 from the elevated train , then rushed downtown to try to help			1
clearly , he did not make that decision and take that fatal detour as a lab analyst , but as the first responder he was trained to be			0
in the months that followed , in addition to uncertainty about @entity10 , our family had to endure suspicion pointed at him			2
before anyone knew where he was , a flyer circulated around the city , saying that my son was wanted for questioning			0
and the @entity100 ran a story with @entity10 's photo and this hateful headline : " missing -- or hiding ? " it was n't until late march that the police told us that @entity10 's remains had been found beneath the pile -- in 34 pieces			1
ultimately , what we would get to bury was nothing more than a body bag filled with all that was left of our son			0
at @entity10 's funeral , the many mourners included mayor @entity119 , police commissioner @entity120 and our congressman , @entity121			1
the @entity122 , enacted in response to the terror attacks , specifically refers to @entity10 as a 9/11 hero			1
yet , at the @entity15 , his name is grouped among the miscellaneous victims , not among the first responders who sacrificed their lives , where it belongs			2
@entity10 responded to the call of duty , transcending the barriers of race , faith and ethnicity			2
yet , sadly , he is not getting his due place in history			0
@entity10 is not here to defend himself			2
but i will speak for him			0
he is my strength , and i am his voice .			0

@entity142 : my son , @entity5 , was killed on 9/11
@entity5 : what i want is a recognition that he died as a first responder
given his training and *aspirations* , he rushed bravely to help those at @entity82 , she says
@entity5 : @entity10 's name should be reflected and listed on the @entity15
