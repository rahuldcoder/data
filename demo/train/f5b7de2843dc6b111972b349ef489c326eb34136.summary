-- the deadly flash floods that swept through remote @entity3 valleys , killing some campers and leaving many others missing , are a grim reminder of the sudden nature of flash floods and the importance of being prepared for emergencies			1
emergency preparedness is important at any time , as emergencies are more common than people may think			1
however , being prepared for emergency situations is even more critical when people are out in the wilderness and further away from phones or cell phone access , hospitals and emergency help			1
more than 40 percent of @entity19 plan to go hiking or camping this summer , second in popularity only to swimming as a summer activity , according to a recent @entity24 survey			1
however , the survey also found that less than two - thirds of @entity19 feel prepared to respond to a serious outdoor emergency such as broken bones , animal bites or heat stroke			0
flash floods are a serious threat to summer campers and hikers , especially in narrow valleys where heavy rains can cause water to rise quickly			2
media reports from @entity3 say that after more than a half foot of rain , water in the @entity42 and @entity43 rivers rose quickly overnight -- at times faster than 8 feet per hour -- inundating campgrounds in remote valleys and catching many campers asleep			2
the @entity24 has a series of preparedness tips that people should follow : share your travel plans with a family member , neighbor or friend listen to area radio and television stations and a @entity57 for possible flood warnings and reports of flooding in progress or other critical information from the @entity63			1
be prepared to evacuate at a moment 's notice			0
when a flood or flash flood warning is issued for your area , head for higher ground and stay there			0
if you come upon a flowing stream where water is above your ankles , stop , turn around and go another way -- 6 inches of swiftly moving water can sweep you off of your feet			0
if you come upon a flooded road while driving , turn around and go another way			0
if you are caught on a flooded road and waters are rising rapidly around you , get out of the car quickly and move to higher ground			0
most cars can be swept away by less than 2 feet of moving water			0
keep children out of the water , as their curiosity could cause them to get too close to fast - moving flood waters			0
be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood danger			0
download our @entity94 checklist , visit redcross.org or contact your local @entity24 for additional information on how to prepare for emergencies and to get trained			1
recognizing the importance of preparedness for people who are hiking or camping , the @entity24 this year began offering a new wilderness and @entity105 course designed to teach people how to respond to an emergency in a setting where emergency help is more than one hour away -- from treating severe wounds and broken bones to dealing with animal bites , bee stings , plant poisoning and weather emergencies			1
the course includes recommendations for the contents of wilderness and remote area first aid kits , and offers training on what to do in emergencies that include allergic reactions , altitude sickness , sprains , fractures , burns , heat - related illness , hypothermia , lightning strikes , heart attacks , drowning , wound treatment and snakebite			1
with summer starting and more people getting outside , it is important that families include emergency preparedness in the summer planning			2
sadly , severe weather and summer are inseparable			0
preparedness is especially important for people who will be hiking or camping in remote areas			1
