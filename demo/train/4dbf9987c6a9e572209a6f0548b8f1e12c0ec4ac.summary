spc. @entity0 , who ended his life after killing three people at the @entity3 , @entity4 , military base wednesday , was undergoing diagnostic procedures for post-traumatic stress disorder , according to lt. gen @entity8 , @entity3 's commanding general			2
he was also receiving a variety of treatments for conditions including depression , anxiety and sleep disturbances , army secretary @entity9 told the @entity16 thursday			2
@entity0 did not receive a diagnosis of @entity18 , but the incident puts the condition in the spotlight			1
a big challenge in helping veterans with @entity18 is the amount of time that passes before a diagnosis , which can be three to four months , said @entity27 , a stress coach in @entity28 who has worked with @entity18 patients and is a civilian contractor with the @entity31			1
in the general population , @entity18 is diagnosed right away , but in the military there are bureaucratic holdups before a diagnosis is officially given , he said			1
" the system itself gets bogged down			2
" @entity40 press secretary @entity39 said thursday that more needs to be done to support military veterans and their families			2
" we need to be very mindful in this country that even as those wars end , what we owe our veterans does not end , " he said			0
here are facts you should know about @entity18 : @entity3 shooter was @entity52 vet being treated for mental health issues 1			1
what is @entity55 ? it 's natural to experience fear in dangerous situations			1
but people with @entity18 may behave as though they are under attack when there is no real imminent threat			1
a person who suffers ptsd typically re-experiences the trauma through flashbacks and nightmares , experiences that can seem as real as the actual trauma			1
the person often feels intensely that the trauma could happen again at any time			1
thoughts and feelings can trigger symptoms , but so can words , situations or objects that remind the person of a traumatic situation			1
how common is it ? anyone who has experienced a life - threatening situation can develop @entity18 , according to dr. @entity83 , a professor of psychiatry at the @entity85			1
although over the course of a lifetime , many people have extremely distressing or threatening experiences , only a small percentage will experience @entity18 , experts say			1
the range of responses is largely based on the amount of exposure to the stressor , said @entity83			0
most studies examining the rate of @entity18 in service members put the rates at about 15 % to 20 %			1
thirty percent of service members who have fought in @entity52 or @entity101 have been diagnosed with @entity18 , according to a @entity103 study			1
the nonprofit think - tank @entity104 estimates a third of veterans likely have some type of traumatic brain injury , ptsd or depression , which puts the overall number affected at around 600,000			1
" we need to remember that while substantial numbers of vets have mental health conditions , " the majority do not , @entity83 said			0
" we do n't want to stigmatize our vets , because many of them are not ill , " he said			0
" as an organization and as a community , the military has varying levels of health and risk			1
there are more services for mental health care in the military than there has ever been before			0
" what is war 's true toll ? the @entity130 3			0
what causes ptsd ? experiencing any kind of trauma or dangerous event -- including seeing people harmed or killed or personally getting injured -- raises the risk for ptsd			1
a history of mental illness also makes ptsd more likely , as does a lack of social support after a traumatic event and enduring additional stress in its aftermath			1
scientists are looking at the role of genes that are involved in the creation of fear memories			0
there are also neuroscientists investigating brain differences in people who have ptsd			2
genes and brain structural differences may raise a person 's risk for the condition without causing symptoms , according to the @entity79			1
the early growth of the brain may be affected by environmental factors or a history of mental illness			0
do other mental illnesses make it worse ? other problems such as depression and insomnia that a veteran may have had before deployment are magnified with @entity18 , @entity27 said			1
" it does not help itself , " he said			0
" it 's kind of like a pinball that gets trapped inside a machine that ca n't get out and just continues to ping around			2
you try to live your life as normal as possible but it 's always present			0
how is it diagnosed in the military ? a typical ptsd screening would be a well - structured diagnostic interview , and a few other tests , lasting about two hours , said @entity181 , psychology professor at the @entity182			2
during the debriefing process from the @entity185 military , returning soldiers go through an interview and other evaluations that may indicate @entity18 , @entity27 said			1
if there is reason to suspect @entity18 , the veteran then goes for a full medical evaluation that involves ptsd testing			1
there is generally not a big lag time to make a medical diagnosis after the two - hour interview , @entity194 said			0
however , it can take months before the diagnosis is officially recognized by the military , @entity27 said			0
many cases of @entity18 go undetected because some view the condition as a sign of weakness			1
some also do n't want to go through the extra battery of tests when they return home , he said			0
" many of these individuals fall through the cracks , " @entity27 said			0
do people with @entity18 pose an increased risk of violence to themselves or others ? having ptsd does not mean that a person will be violent			1
but certain sounds , images and smells can trigger alarming memories to a person with the condition , and they react as if they were in the midst of war			2
" reality becomes skewed because you 've been trained to be violent , " @entity27 said			2
" so it 's really hard to shut that out			0
" @entity18 is not only about fear and anxiety			1
patients may experience other kinds of emotional disturbances , and violence may be a way that they respond			0
" coping with strong feelings of anger , shame or guilt can be played out in terms of violent behavior , " @entity181 said			1
@entity52 and @entity101 veterans who struggle with anger are twice as likely as other vets to be arrested for crimes , according to the @entity246 , which published a study last year			0
the study , conducted by the @entity249 , examined 1,388 combat veterans			0
researchers found that about 23 % of those with ptsd and high irritability had been arrested for criminal offenses			2
but researchers also found that other factors unrelated to military service -- including growing up around violence or drug abuse -- were factors behind why some vets committed crimes			0
does this impact veterans ' performance in the workplace , after they leave the service ? employers sometimes cite ptsd as a reason for not hiring veterans , because of public misunderstanding , former president @entity270 said in february at the @entity272			2
the condition , he said , is mislabeled as a " disorder			0
" " employers would not hesitate to hire an employee getting treated for a medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure , and they should not hesitate to hire veterans getting treated for post-traumatic stress , " @entity270 said			0
a person who has been successful in treatment should be able to function in the workplace , @entity194 said			0
but without treatment , symptoms can be severe , and impair functioning at work , in social situations and in the family			2
how do people with @entity18 come back to normal ? exposure therapy often helps the person with @entity18 revisit or re-experience their trauma as a means of lessening the effect the memory has on them , said dr. @entity298 , a psychiatrist who works with the military and has pioneered use of virtual reality for treating ptsd			1
this kind of therapy has been around for years			2
typically a therapist would ask someone to imagine they are experiencing their trauma again			1
this would happen repeatedly , and ideally , with each retelling of what happened , the event would seem gradually less threatening			2
@entity298 , who is with the @entity311 at the @entity312 , and other experts have employed virtual reality for this purpose			0
patients wear goggles and describe their experiences while a technician stands by with a console changing the scene to fit the patient 's description			0
if the patient recalls hearing a young boy 's voice , for instance , the technician makes that happen			0
if the patient experienced the trauma at night or in the daytime , or perhaps was involved in an @entity334 explosion , those circumstances will be created in the virtual world			2
" we can begin to pace the exposure in a very evocative fashion , " @entity298 said			0
" this works because some people do n't engage in the trauma memory at a sufficient level			2
they do n't engage fully with their imagination to confront difficult memories			0
" a therapy that uses similar principles is called cognitive processing therapy			0
it helps patients become aware of their thoughts and feelings and learn how to deal with changes in beliefs from before and after trauma			1
some patients also benefit from medication			0
what resources are available to help service members , veterans and families ? everyone in the family of a service member with @entity18 needs to be involved in the treatment plan , @entity27 said			1
the @entity365 has a variety of resources on its website			0
these include the @entity370 , which helps service members overcome stigma surrounding mental health treatment , and @entity374 , which helps people locate support services			0

thoughts and feelings can trigger symptoms of ptsd
