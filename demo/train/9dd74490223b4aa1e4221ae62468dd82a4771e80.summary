although @entity161 is a prosecution witness , his testimony may bolster the defense case , @entity3 legal analyst @entity173 said after thursday 's gripping testimony			1
prosecutors appear to have been trying to demonstrate that @entity0 and @entity6 had a loud argument before the shooting , suggesting it 's the reason he killed her			1
