-- big - spending @entity1 and @entity3 have been heavily sanctioned by @entity5 football body @entity4 for breaching new rules on @entity7			1
the respective champions of @entity9 and @entity10 are among nine clubs that have failed to comply with rulings brought in with the aim of making football more financially stable			1
city has been bankrolled by @entity17 royal @entity16 since 2008 , while @entity3 was bought by the @entity18 in 2011			2
both clubs have leaped to prominence on the back of massive investments , signing top players and announcing lucrative sponsorship deals with companies closely linked to their owners -- such as @entity27 and the @entity28			0
the latter was identified by @entity4 as having broken its financial rules -- it said friday that its valuation of @entity3 's reported € 700 million ( $ 960 million ) four - year agreement was " significantly below that submitted by the club			1
" despite such revenue , @entity1 and @entity3 exceeded the permitted losses of $ 62 million over the course of the 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13 seasons			1
@entity1 , which last weekend won the @entity39 title for the second time in three years , said it would accept punishments including a fine of € 60 million ( $ 82 million ) , a restriction on transfer spending and a reduction in the club 's squad size for the @entity47			1
of the fine , € 10 million will be taken from earnings in this season 's @entity47 and the same amount from the next campaign -- while the rest will be returned if @entity1 meets its financial obligations over a three - year period			2
it will have to limit spending on new players to € 60 million for the upcoming transfer window , on top of funds raised by sales of existing squad members			0
" this will have no material impact on the club 's planned transfer activity , " @entity1 said friday , having negotiated a settlement with @entity4 in talks over the past month			2
" at the heart of those discussions is a fundamental disagreement between the club 's and @entity4 's respective interpretations of the @entity7 regulations on players purchased before 2010 , " @entity1 said			1
" the club believes it has complied with the @entity7 regulations on this and all other matters			0
" @entity1 , which reached the last 16 in this season 's @entity47 , can only register 21 players for the 2014 - 15 competition -- the usual maximum is 25			0
however , it noted that manager @entity85 used only 21 of 23 players registered for 2013 - 14			0
the whole club 's salaries -- those of its players are the largest in world sport -- for next season must stay at the same level as the one just completed , though @entity1 said : " in reality , the existing @entity1 business plan sees a natural decline in that wage bill			0
" @entity1 made a record @entity99 loss of $ 307.8 million in 2010 - 11 and $ 192 million the year before -- all of which were covered by billionaire @entity16			0
in 2012 its deficit was $ 160 million and last year $ 87 million , but the club said it expects to break even for the period ending may 31			0
" operating with no debt , the club is realizing its football and commercial opportunities whilst continuing unprecedented investments in both youth development and the local community , " @entity1 said			0
@entity3 said friday it would accept the financial sanctions imposed by @entity4 -- the same that @entity1 faces -- despite " irreconcilable differences " over its sponsorship with the @entity28			1
it said the measures imposed would mean a " tremendous handicap " as it seeks to establish itself as one of @entity4 's leading clubs , having reached the @entity47 quarterfinals this season			2
" we will continue to invest in developing a highly competitive team and we will continue our investments in our stadium and training infrastructures while at the same time remaining , as we are today , debt free , " @entity3 president @entity120 said in a statement			0
@entity129 clubs @entity128 , @entity130 and @entity131 were also sanctioned for exceeding spending limits , being fined € 200,000 and told to meet break - even limits , as was @entity135 's @entity134			1
@entity137 's @entity136 , @entity138 and @entity139 must reduce their operating deficits to break - even by 2016 and freeze wage bills , while also facing reduction in squad sizes and limits on new player registrations for @entity5 competitions			2
an announcement had been expected at the start of this month but was delayed by the complexity of the legal proceedings involved , @entity4 secretary general @entity147 said on tuesday			0
the financial fair play rules are supposed to stop clubs getting into unmanageable debt , or allow wealthy benefactors to give top teams and unfair advantage			1
earlier this month , @entity159 manager @entity158 argued that any team that broke @entity7 rules should be excluded from @entity5 competition			2
in 2012 , @entity4 began withholding prize money from clubs which did not meet the financial restrictions , and at the end of that year @entity168 club @entity166 was banned from @entity5 competition for a season and fined € 300,000 due to unpaid bills .			1

@entity1 and @entity3 accept punishments for breaking spending rules
@entity4 imposes sanctions to nine @entity5 clubs under financial fair play regulations
@entity9 and @entity10 champions are bankrolled by @entity182 owners
three @entity137 clubs and three @entity129 teams also punished , plus one from @entity135
