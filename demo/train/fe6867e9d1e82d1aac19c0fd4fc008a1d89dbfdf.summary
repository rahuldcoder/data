@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 diplomats and @entity5 appear to be inching toward a breakthrough agreement that could slow the nation 's suspected progress toward a nuclear bomb while easing some sanctions that have hobbled its economy			1
top diplomats from the @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 rushed to @entity0 on friday to see whether they could close the deal , which has emerged suddenly after years of frustrating stalemates and @entity4 suspicions of @entity5 cat - and - mouse games with international weapons inspectors			1
@entity25 foreign minister @entity26 may join them on saturday , @entity25 's state - run @entity24 news service reported			1
@entity28 's foreign minister is also headed to @entity0 , according to @entity29			1
the planned arrivals saturday of those officials suggested negotiations did not reach a deal friday night , as the chief @entity5 negotiator -- foreign minister @entity35 -- had earlier predicted			1
negotiations on saturday will include a meeting of @entity14 secretary of state @entity38 , @entity40 foreign policy chief @entity39 and @entity35			1
" the negotiations have reached ( a ) critical , very sensitive situation , and it needs decisions at higher levels , " @entity5 deputy foreign minister @entity41 told reporters in @entity0			1
the emerging deal would ease some sanctions on @entity5 if it stops enriching uranium to 20 % purity -- a key step on the path to a nuclear weapon -- destroys its existing stockpile and takes other steps , according two senior @entity14 administration officials			1
for years , international leaders have suspected @entity5 of working toward nuclear weapons , fearful of the instability such a scenario could bring to the already tense @entity60			1
those fears include the possibility of a pre-emptive @entity64 strike that could spark a broader conflict			0
in the past , @entity5 has threatened @entity64 with military attack			1
@entity5 has denied working toward a nuclear weapon , and has said it will not submit to any plan that would totally eliminate its nuclear program			1
despite those issues , @entity35 said a deal is within reach			0
" we are at a very sensitive stage of negotiations , and it is best if these negotiations are done at the negotiating table rather than on live television , " he told @entity2 's @entity73			0
" but i can tell you that we are prepared to address some of the most immediate concerns that have been raised , and we expect reciprocally our concerns to be met by the @entity83			0
" he had earlier predicted the talks could produce a deal by friday night			1
@entity14 official : we think @entity5 wants a nuclear deal -- and fast @entity64 prime minister @entity89 , who is not involved in the talks , warned that the proposed agreement is " the deal of a century for @entity5 " but a " very dangerous and bad deal for peace			1
" " it 's a very bad deal , " he said			0
" @entity5 is not required to take apart even one centrifuge			1
but the international community is relieving sanctions on @entity5 for the first time after many years			1
@entity5 gets everything that it wanted at this stage and pays nothing			2
" @entity104 prime minister @entity103 tweeted friday that he had discussed the talks with @entity15 president @entity106 and they agreed the talks " offer an opportunity to make real progress			0
" separately , the @entity111 , the @entity112 ' atomic watchdog agency , announced its director will travel to @entity5 on monday to meet senior @entity5 leaders			2
the agency 's nuclear experts will meet the same day with their @entity5 counterparts in @entity119 , the agency said			2
despite the progress , officials said much work remains to be done			0
@entity38 said " some important gaps " remain in the negotiations , echoing earlier comments from his @entity15 counterpart , @entity125			1
@entity14 officials outline possible deal two senior @entity14 administration officials said that , under the potential deal , @entity5 would agree : -- to stop enriching nuclear fuel to 20 % purity ; -- to render unusable most of its existing stockpile of such fuel ; -- to agree not to use advanced @entity138 centrifuges , which can enrich nuclear fuel five times faster than older centrifuges ; -- not to activate a plutonium reactor at @entity143			1
in turn , the @entity83 would agree : -- to unfreeze some @entity5 assets held in banks overseas ; -- to consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold , precious metals and petrochemicals			2
other sweeteners were also under consideration , they said			0
one of the officials said the deal is designed to " stop @entity5 's progress by stopping the shortening of time by which they could build a nuclear weapon " while also providing temporary , reversible sanctions relief to @entity5			1
that official cautioned the deal is not done , but said it could happen if the @entity5 agree to the @entity83 's demands			1
most sanctions to stay in place speaking to @entity170 on thursday , @entity169 said the @entity14 would retain its " core sanctions " in place against @entity5 while granting " very modest relief " from economic sanctions			2
" so that if it turned out during the course of the six months when we 're trying to resolve some of these bigger issues that they 're backing out of the deal , they 're not following through on it , or they 're not willing to go forward and finish the job of giving us assurances that they 're not developing a nuclear weapon , " @entity169 told @entity170 , " we can crank that dial back up			0
" broader implications the strategy of pursuing a phased deal " is a sensible way for the administration to proceed , " said @entity188 , former @entity14 ambassador to @entity189			0
and if it works , reaching a deal with @entity5 would be " stunning , " said @entity195 , director of the @entity196 and a former member of the @entity198			1
" this is way beyond the initial deal that people speculated about , " she said on @entity2 's " @entity199 " on friday			2
" if this can work , if they can get to this agreement today , i see all kinds of advantages for other issues pending in the @entity60 , like @entity208 , " she said			0
@entity5 's cooperation could be key to ending the civil war there , she said			2
' getting to the root of the problem ' the details were hashed out during a bilateral @entity14 - @entity5 meeting -- part of an apparent effort on each side to mend fences -- which lasted about an hour on the sidelines of broader talks under way in @entity0			1
the @entity14 delegation was led by under secretary of state @entity223			2
the @entity5 delegation was led by deputy foreign minister @entity41			1
@entity5 talks : do we want a deal or a war ? " the main issue is getting to the root of the problem , which is the enrichment issue and all things that lead from that , " @entity231 , spokesman for @entity232 , said on the sidelines of negotiations			1
moments later , the @entity5 state - run @entity239 tweeted a quote from @entity41 : " enrichment is our red line , and its suspension is unacceptable			1
" @entity5 's supreme leader ' not optimistic ' about nuclear talks when @entity2 asked @entity41 about the issue of uranium enrichment , he declined to answer			2
" the talks are extremely complex and are now going into a serious phase , " @entity231 said			0
" we want to focus on substance and hope there will be concrete progress over the next couple of days			0
" @entity35 said @entity5 's nuclear program would continue in some form			2
" there wo n't be a suspension of our enrichment program in its entirety , " he said			0
" but we can deal with various issues			0
various issues are on the table			0
" history of the issue the sudden progress in meetings between @entity5 and the group of nations known as the @entity83 or @entity271 -- @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity25 , @entity28 and @entity17 -- comes after years of stalemate between @entity4 nations and @entity5 over its nuclear program			1
it also follows a slight thaw in relations between @entity5 and the @entity277 under newly elected president @entity278			2
@entity5 has always maintained its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes , despite repeated findings by @entity112 weapons inspectors that the country appeared to be conducting nuclear weapons research			2
in august , the @entity111 -- the @entity112 nuclear watchdog -- estimated that since declaring its nuclear program , @entity5 has processed 10 metric tons of uranium to 5 % purity , the level used for nuclear power plants			0
the @entity111 estimates that @entity5 has a stockpile of 410 pounds ( 185 kilograms ) of uranium at 20 % purity			0
weapons experts warn that this uranium could be further refined for use in a nuclear warhead			0
although experts suggest that amount would not be enough for a single warhead , the @entity111 has warned that it believes @entity5 's nuclear program could have " possible military dimensions			0
" @entity5 has been under crippling @entity112 sanctions related to its nuclear program since 2006			0
the @entity14 first sanctioned @entity5 over its nuclear program in 2000			0
resolutions and sanctions passed by the @entity112 in 2006 called on @entity5 to halt all enrichment activities and clarify that its nuclear facilities were being used for peaceful purposes only			0
