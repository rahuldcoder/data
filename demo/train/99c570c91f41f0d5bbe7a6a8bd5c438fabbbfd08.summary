-- with an awesome story and continuation of the gameplay that has made the franchise great , " @entity5 " ties a brilliant and bloody bow atop a video - game trilogy that 's been seven years in the making			1
the latest third - person shooter game from @entity10 and @entity11 wraps up the " @entity19 " story arc and answers all the lingering questions that have arisen in the battle against the @entity16 and their mutant cousins , the @entity18			1
players will control @entity22 soldier @entity21 for most of the game			1
but certain levels require the player to switch off to another member of his @entity27			1
the game starts a couple years after the conclusion of " @entity29 " and finds @entity21 in jail			1
characters familiar to players of the franchise are re-introduced in the opening scenes , and the action kicks off quickly at an unrestrained pace			1
@entity37 typically offers four options for weapons : a primary weapon , secondary weapon , pistol and grenade			1
three other players are with the team , and they can be controlled by the computer or by others for co-op play , which is fun if you want to get a real feel for the campaign while enjoying the game with your friends			1
the weapons have weight to them and feel powerful			2
shooting from behind cover , one of the hallmarks of the franchise , is required as enemies appear from nearly every angle			2
you 'll want to keep your head down			2
not only will a mate come to your rescue when you are down , they can also set up opportunities to flank your opponents and end battles quicker			2
it all flows naturally ( much like the copious amounts of blood spilled in the battles ) and is well - paced , with plenty of ammo and weapons to be scavenged and used			2
the game helps new players along with a casual mode that highlights enemies and objectives for easier play			1
there is an " aim - assist " mode that will line up enemies if you have trouble getting those pesky locusts in your crosshairs			2
six modes of multiplayer action offer all kinds of mission objectives beyond just killing the other team			1
whether it 's capturing and holding an enemy leader ( while defending your own ) or playing as one of the monsters against human opponents , variety will keep players entertained			2
dedicated servers around the world , which will host the multiplayer games , also will be available , fulfilling a common player desire from previous " @entity110 " games			0
developers said this should eliminate the perception that players hosting multiplayer matches had an advantage over other players			0
the real victory for " @entity5 " is the immersive and gripping story			1
lingering questions and mysteries finally get answers , and there is a sense of finality that runs through the entire campaign			1
the interaction between characters never feels forced or fake			0
their emotions are believable , and their concern for one another is genuine			0
i described it to a friend as a " soap opera for guys , " but it is more like a tv mini-series			0
the action blends well with the dialogue and creates a flow that helps pull the player along from scene to scene			0
it all comes off seamlessly and leaves the player emotionally invested in all of the characters			0
but be prepared for the unexpected as people will die and loyalties will be tested			0
overall , " @entity5 " is exciting , emotional and blends competitiveness with teamwork			0
whether playing the campaign alone or with friends , the story mixes with the action fluidly and provides a satisfying feeling even if the ending may not be to your liking			1
in multiplayer mode , the different modes offer challenges for any type of player and put a premium on strategy to achieve victory			0
as this trilogy ends , do n't be surprised if there is more " @entity19 " action down the road			1
plans for books , comics and film projects are out there , so it may not take much to enlist @entity27 for another mission			0
" @entity5 " is available now in @entity180 and @entity181 and will be available thursday in @entity182			0
it is an @entity184 exclusive title and rated m for mature due to blood and gore , intense violence and strong language			0
