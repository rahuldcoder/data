@entity1 the boys — and girls — of @entity4 are back in town			2
lawmakers new and old picked up their keys to their new offices and got sworn in for the 114th @entity9 on tuesday			1
unlike any other day of the year , all was not pomp and circumstance , but rather chaos and confusion			2
animals ( at least , a pet or two ) roamed the halls ; desks and debris lined the @entity4 basement walls ; republicans congratulated @entity21 and vice-versa			2
even @entity24 sen. @entity23 and @entity26 sen. @entity25 , two potential @entity20 presidential primary opponents , hugged it out in the hallways			2
it marked a rare moment of camaraderie between parties and potential political foes as they prepare for what looks to be as contentious a new @entity9 as ever			1
on the @entity43 side , an attempt orchestrated by conservatives to unseat @entity39 from his position as speaker came closer to success than many expected , with more than two dozen @entity20 voting against him — a show of discontent not seen , according to the @entity49 , since 1860			2
and expressed openness from president @entity51 and @entity53 majority leader @entity52 to work together seemed already forgotten as the @entity43 promised to veto a bill to approve the @entity55 , which @entity20 had promised would be the very first part of their agenda after they took full control			0
@entity62 sen. @entity61 , a member of the new @entity21 minority in the @entity53 and a former member of the @entity43 , said he was committed to getting something done on @entity4 even with republicans at the helm — but sounded less than confident it was possible			0
" whether in the majority or the minority , you have to work with the other party , " he said , noting during his decades on the @entity70 passing hundreds of bills he had always worked with @entity20			1
but asked whether he felt @entity20 were sincere in their stated openness to working with @entity21 , @entity61 admitted : " my hope is that there is a pent - up desire to legislate			1
" there was , however , some bipartisan love seen in the halls of @entity9 on tuesday , perhaps brought on — or allowed to slip out — by the chaos of the day			1
@entity20 sen. @entity84 of @entity85 received a congratulatory handshake from @entity88 @entity21 sen. @entity87 in the hallway off the old @entity53 chamber , before turning to say " hi " to newly - minted @entity20 sen. @entity92 of @entity93			1
@entity92 had lost his family in the crush of people waiting for their picture and the potential for a kiss on the cheek from vice president @entity101			0
watch : @entity101 swearing in senators makes great tv " well , we 've got four kids , my wife , my mom and dad ! " @entity92 shrugged when asked how he managed to lose his family on day one			0
@entity24 rep. @entity111 , who was joined by his look - a - like older brother , planned like many of his colleagues to bring a young family member onto the floor — his younger nephew — while he was sworn in			1
former @entity119 sen. @entity118 was meting out kisses of his own , planting one right on @entity1 @entity21 sen. @entity122 's cheek after scooping her and his successor , new sen. @entity123 , into a group hug during @entity123 ' introductory party			1
@entity127 sen. @entity126 — who braved a storm in @entity129 to make it in and marveled that he was only 45 minutes late — party - hopped			1
" just get to as many receptions as you can , " he said , " and if you 're a new member having a reception , stay around and greet and thank as many people that helped you get here			0
" he said he had already stopped by receptions for newly - minted @entity20 colleagues sens. @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 , and had about a dozen receptions he planned to hit — but he 'd spend " most of my time " with his new colleague from @entity127 , sen. @entity144			1
@entity144 was one of a handful of rising stars on the campaign trail who were finally anointed as full members of their parties on @entity4 on tuesday			1
@entity151 , an @entity152 representative from @entity153 , got a special visit from rep. @entity155 — who thanked her friends and family for bringing " this budding star " to @entity9 — before heading to the @entity43 floor for the first business of the new @entity9			1
looking somewhat shell - shocked at being accosted by a reporter in the hallways , @entity151 summed up the first day for many congressional newbies : " i 'm excited , " she said			2
" do n't know what to expect			0
" " i 'm just going " with it , she added			0
but there ran , underneath the fun and excitement , an undercurrent of tension that was difficult to ignore			0
conservatives who voted against @entity39 were grumbling before days end about punishments they were already being given or warned about by the speaker and others			0
some democrats , like @entity88 sen. @entity178 , who remains a perennial thorn in the president 's side , criticized his opposition to the @entity55 bill , while still others sought to support him and the green elements in their base			0
senate minority whip @entity187 delayed a planned committee hearing on the legislation by objecting to it on the floor of the @entity53			0
indeed , it seemed despite tuesday 's fun , the dirty work of legislating was n't far from lawmakers ' minds			2
" it 's more or less ceremony today , " @entity126 said			0
" the hard work begins tomorrow			0

members old and new were sworn in to @entity9 on tuesday and moved into new digs
many party - hopped to meet their new colleagues and see their old friends
tensions between , and within , the parties remained despite the friendly *atmosphere* tuesday
