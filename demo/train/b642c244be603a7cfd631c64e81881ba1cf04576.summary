the @entity0 and @entity1 have the most important bilateral relationship in the world			1
whether they can develop a constructive , cooperative relationship or whether they become each others ' greatest nightmare has enormous consequences for each country and for the capacity of the international system to manage regional and global issues			2
both leaderships recognize what is at stake , which explains why , despite many disagreements , @entity17 and @entity18 constantly stress the importance of building ties			0
the two governments conduct more than 60 formal dialogues a year and engage each other daily , to a far greater extent than most people realize			0
despite these efforts , each country has an underlying and growing distrust of the other 's long - term intentions			2
such distrust is corrosive , casting even well - intentioned actions and initiatives in a negative light			0
when president @entity37 opened the door to @entity18 40 years ago , nobody imagined that @entity0 - @entity1 relations would develop to this point			1
but extensive governmental contacts between the nations , economic interdependence and huge flows of students and tourists back and forth have failed to stem the growth of underlying mutual distrust			0
that distrust could well create a self - fulfilling prophecy of eventual confrontation			0
a key problem is that neither government is confident that it understands how the other sees the future of their relationship			0
although each side senses distrust in the other , the real reasons for that attitude are unclear			0
so , how do they separate propaganda efforts designed to manipulate from sincere concerns ? because this is such a tough and consequential problem , i teamed up with one of @entity1 's leading @entity0 specialists to write a report that lays out the underlying worries that each side has about the other and , especially , why they have these deep concerns			1
our report was published simultaneously last week in @entity75 and @entity1			2
my colleague wrote , in unvarnished fashion , about the analysis that leads many policymakers in @entity1 to believe the ultimate goal of the @entity0 is to constrain or disrupt @entity1 's rise and to undermine its political system			1
i wrote about @entity0 hopes for a normal major power relationship with @entity1 over the long run and the reasons why many @entity0 policymakers are increasingly concerned that this may prove impossible			1
in part , they include the inevitable tensions that arise when a global balance of power is changing			0
my colleague and i expect that @entity0 will retain its leading role for many years to come , but the gap between @entity0 and @entity1 power and position is narrowing			1
because of that , many in @entity1 fear the @entity0 might resort to @entity100 measures to maintain its lead			1
@entity0 officials worry not so much that @entity1 will rise , but that @entity18 will believe it can only do so at direct cost to the @entity0			1
our enormously different political systems exacerbate this distrust			0
neither side understands very well the political and institutional constraints in the other 's system , and both are inclined to assume the other is more strategic , centralized and internally disciplined than it is			1
neither is certain that it knows when the other is being honest about its domestic political constraints , and both tend to take random events as reflections of strategic intent			0
@entity18 views @entity0 's pro-democracy foreign policy as aimed , in part , at changing @entity1 's system , while @entity17 inherently distrusts the motives and actions of authoritarian governments			1
and unsurprisingly , both sides have partially institutionalized distrust in their militaries , intelligence agencies , and offices focused on cybersecurity			0
distrust about long - term intentions is thus grounded in complicated narratives in both countries			0
neither side wants an adversarial relationship , but both worry that it may become unavoidable			2
and extensive efforts to build mutual trust to date are not working			0
both governments must discuss , in depth , topics they have been avoiding			2
what overall military postures in @entity150 will both permit @entity1 to meet its vital security needs and enable @entity0 to defend its allies and interests ? what kinds of mutual restraint can help bring about this outcome ? how does each side view potential developments on the @entity159 over the coming decade , and how would both plan to react to each scenario ? @entity0 conducts surveillance activities just outside @entity1 's territorial waters that @entity18 views as hostile and degrading			1
could @entity1 provide some type of increased military transparency that could change this ? could the military component of the @entity169 issue be reduced ? understanding views of the long term , clarifying thinking on key military issues and devising concrete efforts to build mutual confidence are the initiatives that could alter the perceptions in @entity17 and @entity18 that enhance distrust			1
the future can be shaped by intelligent actions , but those must be based on clear recognition of the reasons why each side fears the future intentions of the other .			2

@entity187 : @entity0 and @entity1 have the most important bilateral relationship in the world
although the nations stress cooperation , he says , each side distrusts the other 's intentions
@entity187 : @entity1 believes @entity0 wants to stop its rise and change its political system
military topics must be discussed in depth , he writes , and confidence needs to be built
