-- a @entity2 judge set bail at $ 15,000 wednesday for a man who wrote a controversial book considered a " how - to " guide for pedophiles			1
@entity8 , who was arrested in @entity9 on monday , said the book , " @entity11 to love and pleasure : a @entity16 's @entity15 , " can be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles			1
and , instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest , it teaches them to avoid illegal actions , he said			2
@entity8 has been charged with the distribution of obscene material depicting minors engaged in harmful conduct , @entity2 authorities said			1
he made his first appearance in a @entity2 courtroom wednesday afternoon			1
his court appearance came a day after he held court in front of reporters explaining the nature of his book			1
asked if he is a pedophile , @entity8 said , " i only have sex with grown - ups			2
" he said he has no children and " i do n't keep children around my house			0
" @entity41 , @entity2 , sheriff @entity42 has said his detectives were able to establish jurisdiction in the case by conducting an undercover operation , buying the book through the mail			1
greaves protested tuesday saying he is the target of entrapment , but @entity42 disagreed			0
" he wrote this book , he published this book , he put it on @entity60 to sell , " @entity42 told reporters as @entity8 was being booked into the @entity53 , " and he freely responded to our desire to purchase it			1
" @entity8 and his book gained national attention earlier this year after @entity60 defended selling the book on its website despite angry comments and threats of boycotts from thousands of people			1
the book was removed from the website in early november			0
officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children , grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents			0
@entity42 said @entity49 ' book outlines a " code of ethics " that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children			1
@entity8 told reporters tuesday he wrote the book to exorcise his own childhood			1
he said he was introduced to sex at the age of 7 by a 10 - year - old friend and began having sex with other children			0
this continued , he said , until he was about 15 , when he stopped and did not have sex again for years			0
" once i got into adolescence , i suppose you could have identified me as an adolescent pedophile , " he said			0
but now , he said , he is an example of the fact that people can reform			0
" i think all speech should be protected , " @entity8 said			2
but " i was not the one who solicited the material to be sent to @entity2			2
i think @entity2 law is for @entity104 and @entity9 law is for @entity106			2
" he told reporters he will not be able to make bond : " i 'm actually quite poor			0
" judge @entity109 said wednesday in court that if @entity8 does not post bail he must remain in @entity2 , can not have contact with anyone younger than 18 and can not have access to a computer			1
@entity0 legal analyst @entity116 said on @entity0 's " @entity117 " monday night that prosecutors may have a hard time convicting @entity8 , and maintained his arrest was unconstitutional			1
" i do n't think they can go forward because the book is clearly protected by the @entity123 , " @entity116 said			0
" this book , as awful as it is , it is only words			0
" @entity42 vehemently disagreed with @entity116 's assessment of the case and the two sparred on the program			0
" this has nothing to do with free speech and everything to do with obscenity , " @entity42 said			0
