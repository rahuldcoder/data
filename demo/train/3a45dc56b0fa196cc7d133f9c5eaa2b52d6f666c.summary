@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 's two million residents faced increasingly dire shortages of food and water tuesday as rebels estimated the number of people killed during the past six months to be at least 50,000			1
" i can not overstate the urgency of this moment , " @entity11 @entity10 ban ki - moon said			1
" @entity13 is of the essence			1
" @entity10 said his goal was to get @entity11 personnel on the ground " as quickly as possible			1
" sixty percent of @entity0 was without water or sanitation , @entity10 said			1
the @entity20 said @entity22 forces had closed water - pumping stations in @entity24 along the route from @entity0 to @entity26 while fleeing the capital			1
the resulting disruption of the water supply in @entity0 is " a major issue , " an @entity20 spokeswoman said , adding that security concerns along the road to the stations made it impossible to predict when the flow could be restored			1
all 31 @entity20 countries have been asked whether they can help if the situation worsens , she said			2
the @entity11 children 's agency was procuring five million liters ( 1.3 million gallons ) of water to ship to @entity0			1
the @entity11 ' @entity42 was sending 600 tons of food commodities -- wheat flour , pasta , vegetable oil and tomato paste -- for the @entity48 to distribute in @entity0			1
the impact of the parched conditions was visible at the city 's main zoo , where the zookeeper said that , for seven days , the animals got nothing			2
by tuesday , 10 of the usual complement of 200 workers had returned to their jobs			2
they said rations for the big cats had been cut in half			0
in the sweltering heat , rail - thin lions paced their cage , forlorn hippopotamuses looked askance at the tank of fetid water in their cage			2
most of the cages were empty			0
concern over the unfolding humanitarian disaster came as a rebel military commander said that at least 50,000 people , civilians and combatants had been killed in the war to oust @entity22			1
the number was calculated by adding death tolls reported in battle zones and accounts from agencies such as the @entity48 , said @entity85 , the @entity86 coordinator			0
but he did not divulge the data underlying the total and @entity2 can not independently verify it			0
the threat of more bloodshed loomed as reports of human rights violations surfaced and the leader of @entity1 's @entity94 issued an ultimatum tuesday for tribal leaders in towns still under the control of loyalists : surrender or face attack on saturday , after @entity101 festivities have drawn to a close			1
@entity94 head @entity105 told reporters that the rebels were in negotiations with the loyalists and hoped to " avoid more bloodshed and to avoid more destruction and damage , " but would use force if the loyalists do n't surrender			1
" it might have to be decided militarily ; i hope this will not be the case , " he said			0
as fighting continued for the last bastions under @entity22 's grip , the longtime dictator 's whereabouts remained unknown to rebel authorities			1
a clue came from a 17 - year - old who told @entity127 he had seen @entity22 on friday at the compound in @entity0 belonging to one of @entity22 's sons , @entity131			1
the teen said he had been working for the previous month as a guard for @entity134			0
the leader arrived and spoke with his son for 10 to 15 minutes , @entity135 said			0
friday 's visit by @entity22 came as rebels were taking control of the capital and @entity22 loyalists were preparing to flee , the teenager told a translator during an interview in a rebel compound			1
" he said @entity22 was visiting us at the same time when we run away from @entity131 ' compound , " the translator said			1
during the visit , the leader 's daughter , @entity151 , arrived at the compound , where she and her father got into a convoy of vehicles and drove off , the teen told the translator			0
" he said one of the high - ranking soldiers come to us and we asked him , ' where is @entity22 going ? ' and he said ' to @entity26 , ' " the teen said			1
@entity26 is a city in southwestern @entity1 and one of the loyalist strongholds			0
@entity134 then got into an armored @entity166 and drove toward the town of @entity168 , the teen said			0
@entity168 is a city in the @entity169 in the north , another @entity22 stronghold			1
an armored @entity166 was among a number of vehicles that were destroyed later by @entity174 bombs along the road northward			0
but it was not clear whether @entity131 died in that attack			0
@entity0 residents greeted the end of @entity180 with celebratory gunfire amid news of @entity131 ' death sunday night after a battle with rebel forces in northwest @entity1 between @entity186 and @entity168			1
a rebel commander said @entity134 was buried in the area			0
the teen said he had been persuaded to join @entity134 's group when he was told that foreign forces were attacking the country , @entity127 reported			0
@entity2 has not been able to verify the @entity127 report			0
@entity134 's legacy includes his eponymous @entity195 , also known as the @entity195 , which has been accused of human rights abuses			0
@entity197 said monday that the brigade executed detainees a week ago in a warehouse near @entity0			1
forces led by @entity134 also killed scores of captive civilians as they tried to retreat from @entity0 , according to @entity204 , who survived the attack , and @entity2 's @entity207 , who saw the bodies being hauled off			1
@entity197 and @entity210 both documented the alleged incident			0
the legacy also apparently includes @entity213 , who told @entity2 she worked as a nanny for @entity216 , one of @entity22 's sons			1
her face and torso a grotesque , infected mass of scar tissue and infection , she said @entity216 's wife , @entity223 , had poured boiling water over her head as punishment for failing to beat into silence one of @entity229 's crying children			2
during her year of employment , the 30 - year - old @entity231 immigrant said , she had received no pay			0
but on tuesday , she was being treated with antibiotics in a hospital , where she said she was feeling better			0
another of @entity22 's sons , businessman @entity238 , has offered to negotiate an end to the war with the rebels who , he said , can not " build a new country without having us ( at ) the table			1
" he has made previous offers , though this time he appeared ready to cut loose from his father and his brother @entity246 , once considered the @entity1 leader 's heir apparent			0
" if ( the rebels ) agree to cooperate to save the country together , then it will be easy and fast			2
i promise ! " @entity238 said in an e-mail to @entity2 's @entity253			0
in a later e-mail , @entity238 said that the @entity94 had asked him to travel to @entity0 to negotiate , but the rebels would not guarantee his security			1
asked about the offer , @entity94 deputy prime minister @entity257 said @entity238 would get safe passage to @entity0 and would be well treated , but would be put on trial rather than given a chance to negotiate			1
other members of @entity22 's family fared better than @entity131 apparently did : @entity22 's wife , @entity264 , daughter @entity151 and sons @entity265 and @entity216 crossed monday into neighboring @entity267			2
@entity268 , @entity267 's ambassador to the @entity11 , said his nation allowed them to enter on " humanitarian grounds			2
" unlike @entity1 's other neighbors , @entity267 has not recognized the authority of the @entity94 and the authoritarian government in @entity275 has much to fear with @entity277 revolutions so close to home			0
in @entity281 , @entity280 spokeswoman @entity279 said the government of @entity267 had sent a letter to the @entity11 about the matter			2
" we are reviewing that letter now in @entity286 , " she said			0
" but clearly , there has to be an international community decision in response with regard to the travel ban restrictions that ( @entity292 ) 1970 imposes			0
" the resolution , which was passed in february , imposes international sanctions on the @entity22 regime for its use of force against peaceful protesters			2
any nation that takes steps beyond the resolution has 48 hours to explain itself to the @entity304 , she said			0
referring to the @entity267 ' letter , she said , " with regard to our response to it , i think it 's too early to tell			0
" @entity105 said tuesday that the rebels would ask @entity267 to extradite members of the @entity22 family back to @entity1			1
he also said that , once the rebels have full control of the country , courts will be set up to hear people 's complaints against the @entity22 regime			1
but victory remained elusive , with loyalists controlling @entity168 in the north and @entity26 in the south and @entity325 's hometown of @entity326 , which is located on the @entity327 between @entity0 and the opposition nerve center of @entity329			1
on tuesday , the front line of the rebel forces was about 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) west of @entity326 and about 70 kilometers ( 43 miles ) from @entity22 forces			2
" all we 're waiting for is the order from the @entity94 to move into @entity326 , " one rebel said			0
but he and his fellow fighters expressed the hope that negotiations would succeed in the forces laying down their weapons			0
in addition to expressing concern over the humanitarian situation in @entity0 , the @entity11 voiced " extreme alarm " over reports of " atrocious human rights violations " in @entity1 , including summary executions			1
" we are also deeply concerned about reports that there are still thousands of people unaccounted for who were arrested or taken prisoner by @entity22 security forces either earlier in the conflict or before it even started , " said @entity348 , spokesman for the @entity349			2
another report , released tuesday by @entity360 , documents crimes in @entity169 , which had been under siege from @entity22 's forces until rebels seized control			1
the report cites four witnesses who said they saw @entity22 's troops detain 107 civilians and use them as human shields to guard munitions from @entity174 strikes			2
one father told the physicians group that soldiers forced his two young children to sit on a tank , and threatened the family , saying , " you 'll stay here , and if @entity174 attacks us , you 'll die too			0
" the report , which says @entity22 shielded weapons by moving them to markets , mosques and schools , also details accounts of detention and torture			2
still , signs of normalcy were visible tuesday in @entity0 , where some shops reopened , traffic picked up and humanitarian aid was trickling in			2
@entity395 reopened its embassy monday and @entity397 said it was preparing to do the same			0
@entity2 's @entity253 , @entity398 and @entity399 contributed to this story			0
