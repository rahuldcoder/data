first , immigrants steal @entity2 ' jobs			0
and now foreigners are stealing @entity2 ' rightful place on @entity2 postage stamps ! ok , maybe that 's a bit of an exaggeration			2
but a new line of @entity10 stamps released this week by the @entity11 has outraged some stamp enthusiasts			1
as the former head of the @entity15 ( that 's a stamp collecting society to the rest of us ) noted : " @entity10 is not @entity2			1
it 's foreign , and it 's so blatantly commercial it 's off the charts			0
" first off , can a fictitious teenage wizard ever become a @entity2 citizen ? secondly , and far more importantly , the @entity11 is in a financial " hot mess			1
" it 's losing $ 25 million every day			0
and for the 2013 fiscal year , which ended september 30 , the @entity11 ran up a deficit of $ 5 billion			2
at this point , i 'd be all for a stamp bearing the image of @entity32 mayor @entity31 smoking crack if that could generate revenue			2
that 's preferable to higher deficits , drastic cuts in services and increases in stamp prices			1
look , i understand that one of the mandates of the @entity11 is , " portraying the @entity2 experience to a world audience through the issuance of postage stamps			1
" but the " @entity2 experience " is not just colored by @entity2 citizens			0
plus @entity10 and his cast of cohorts are not the first non- @entity2 citizens to grace our stamps			1
@entity56 painter @entity55 , @entity57 and @entity59 singer @entity58 have all been featured on past stamps			2
this is not the first time a new set of stamps has caused controversy			0
in 2001 , the @entity11 came under fire from some on the right when it released the @entity55 stamp because she was a communist , a @entity56 and a bisexual			1
in fact , the late @entity73 senator @entity72 denounced the stamp on the @entity77 floor			0
some have even objected to stamps honoring @entity57 , celebrating the @entity80 holiday , or bearing the image of the famed @entity83 painting of the @entity84 holding the baby @entity85			0
why ? because they were troubled by the religious implications			0
it appears , though , that the real reason for the uproar over the @entity10 stamp is n't his citizenship status			1
rather , it 's because stamp purists are dismayed by the increasing commercialization of @entity2 postage stamps			2
as one collector said : " they should n't be reduced to the latest fads , whatever 's going to sell			0
" this very issue has caused friction between the @entity11 and the @entity103 -- a body established in 1957 to evaluate and recommend to the @entity11 what should be chosen for stamps			1
the tension undoubtedly escalated when the @entity11 chose not to consult with this advisory committee before approving the new @entity10 stamp collection			1
but here 's the thing : it 's not an either / or scenario			0
stamps bearing images of iconic @entity2 , like national parks and national heroes , will always have their audience			0
and pop culture stamps certainly have their legion of fans			0
keep in mind that the stamp featuring @entity124 is the top seller of all time with over 700 million sold			2
so i say it 's time for the @entity11 to roll out stamps that will make money			1
i do n't care if it 's @entity132 swinging on a wrecking ball , an angry @entity134 or @entity135 wearing a tiara			0
these are all preferable to the @entity11 incurring more debt and slashing services to the point where it ends up having to lay off so many postal workers that it 's stuck delivering mail via carrier pigeon .			1

some stamp collectors are upset over a new line of @entity10 stamps
@entity149 : keep in mind that the @entity11 is in a financial mess
he says popular stamps are preferable to higher deficits or drastic cuts in services
@entity149 : the @entity11 should roll out some stamps that can make money
