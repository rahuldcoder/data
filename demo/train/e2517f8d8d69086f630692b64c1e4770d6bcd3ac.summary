@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , which is responsible for the greatest oil spill in @entity6 history , has made the right call in deciding to suspend dividend payments this year			1
dividends are not legally required ; they are optional			0
if @entity3 does not pay a dividend , a shareholder can not go into court and sue @entity3			1
dividends are to be paid only when the company has enough money to take care of its operations , including potential liability for the spill			1
some have argued that @entity3 should pay dividends this year because there are plenty of individuals who count on those quarterly dividends			1
that is a familiar argument			0
it conjures images of the elderly being forced to choose between buying food or medicine			0
that imagery was raised in 2003 , when president @entity32 pushed a dividend tax cut through the @entity35 - controlled @entity34 , reducing the maximum tax rate to be paid on dividends to only 15 percent			0
( you and i pay taxes on our interest and wages at rates up to 35 percent			0
) the reasons for the tax cut were varied , from compensating for risk to encouraging savings to an argument that it " will help millions of seniors who depend upon dividend income for their day - to - day expenses , " a line from congressman @entity56 of @entity57			1
@entity56 was certainly not alone in arguing that the dividend tax cut would help senior citizens			0
@entity32 's signing statement provided that " we 're helping seniors who rely on dividends			1
" what the @entity35 neglected to say was that it was not taxpayers ' senior status that made it more likely that they would receive dividends , but their income levels			2
the typical low - or middle - income senior does not have a lot of income and does not receive dividends			2
a 2006 study by the @entity72 showed that only 4 percent of households with less than $ 50,000 of income own stock and actually receive capital gains and / or corporate dividends			2
only 11 percent of households with incomes under $ 100,000 receive capital gains and / or corporate dividends			0
however , more than 75 percent of all capital gains and dividend income goes to households with income over $ 200,000 , which represents only 3 percent of all @entity6 households			0
the reality is that the typical @entity6 @entity3 shareholder is not really going to miss that dividend payment			2
@entity90 newspapers have reported that @entity90 pension funds have heavily invested in @entity3 , so the impact could be somewhat greater there			2
@entity3 has agreed to create a $ 20 billion escrow fund that will be administered by an independent third party , @entity96 , the mediator who oversaw the september 11 victims ' claims			1
this is certainly a step in the right direction			0
@entity3 is not obligated to pay the $ 20 billion all at once but has several years to fund the escrow account			1
any amount paid to shareholders is forever lost to victims of the @entity106 spill			0
so if @entity3 were to pay any dividends now and subsequently become financially unable to make more payments to the escrow fund , the @entity106 victims would become victimized again			1
shareholders who own stock in an oil company that drills offshore without adequate plans in place , should disaster strike , have made a risky investment indeed			1
given the potentially catastrophic impact of the oil spill , how can bp really know how much all of the costs will be ? and the safest course of action is to wait until the company gets a better handle on its potential liabilities , which seem to be growing daily			0
between the business owners in the @entity106 with their very livelihoods being threatened , the workers who are unable to earn a living and the looming environmental cleanup costs ( once the oil actually stops spilling into the ocean ) on the one hand and @entity3 's shareholders on the other hand , the choice is easy : the shareholders should wait for their dividends			1
after all , is n't that why their tax rates are so low ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			0

@entity3 decided to suspend dividends for rest of year as it creates escrow fund for liability
@entity143 says it 's *impossible* to say how much liability @entity3 will have for oil leak
she says bulk of dividends go to *people* who have high income
investors in oil company that drills offshore assume risk , she says
