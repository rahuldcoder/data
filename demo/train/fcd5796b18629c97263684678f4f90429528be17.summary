@entity3 in the end , as it always has been with @entity1 , it was about the data			1
three weeks to the day since he informed a group of @entity9 financiers in @entity10 that he was serious about a third presidential bid , @entity1 on friday finally pulled the plug on his long and sometimes agonizing political career , telling supporters that he would not mount a third bid for the @entity9 presidential nomination in 2016			1
@entity1 will not run in 2016 " he decided he could be the nominee , " said @entity17 , the oldest of @entity1 's five sons			1
" the fear was that in order to get there it was going to be so hard fought that he could not emerge from a position of strength			0
" the family , he explained , " all said we would support him , although none of us was looking forward to the process			0
but no one said we wo n't go through this			2
" @entity1 's decision to forgo a run , made over the weekend in consultation with his family , came on the heels of what associates described as " frank " and " clinical " strategy session with his closest advisers in @entity45 last friday at the offices of @entity47 , the financial firm run by @entity17 and @entity48 , @entity1 's top fundraiser			1
@entity1 's announcement also came two days after @entity51 , one of @entity1 's closest confidantes since his days as @entity54 governor , announced that he would join the likely campaign of @entity56 , @entity1 's top rival for support in the @entity9 establishment			1
at the @entity45 meeting last week , @entity1 's brain trust gave him a clear - eyed assessment of his chances in 2016 , with some aides chiming in via conference call			1
" it was n't pandering and persuasion , " said one person on the call			2
" it was , ' here 's the data			0
' " @entity1 exit widens path for @entity56 ever since @entity1 trial - ballooned his campaign at the office of @entity9 bundler @entity79 earlier this month , his donor network had grown lukewarm to the idea , his former staffers had started accepting offers with other potential candidates , and the media consensus about " @entity84 " had teetered somewhere between skepticism and ridicule			1
some of his closest longtime associates , including @entity45 - based advisers @entity89 and @entity90 , were pushing him to run			1
his wife @entity92 was also supportive , sources told @entity4 , though anxious about putting themselves through the grueling process of a national campaign once again			0
and one source close to the family says that a donor — on his own — did some " in - depth private polling and the results were shocking " about how strong @entity1 was running			1
others in his camp expressed wariness of another campaign against a much stronger field than the cast of gadflies , flameouts and polarizing conservatives that @entity1 faced in 2012			1
@entity1 was told that while his old grassroots supporters and field organizers in early states like @entity112 and @entity113 maintained deep respect for him , they were not enthused about a third campaign			1
perhaps more frustrating for a businessman who prided himself on the formidable financial network he built in 2012 , @entity1 learned that @entity56 , who had jumped into the presidential fray quickly in early january , was quickly siphoning away his support among top donors and was winning the early battle for @entity9 establishment money			1
in almost every big donor state , @entity56 was securing commitments from bundlers who once ponied up for @entity1			1
@entity17 : i 'm both ' sad and relieved ' at dad 's decision still , his team , ever loyal to the man they affectionately called " the @entity132 , " were in agreement that they would make it work if he wanted to gas up the @entity136 for one more ride			2
" the takeaway was , there is enough wood here to build a fire , " said another close @entity1 adviser who joined the meeting			1
" we thought it was was possible			0
but it would be hard			0
last time we had all the winds at our back and this would have been difficult , but absolutely doable			0
look , if people like @entity153 can get in , then it 's a no brainer that the governor could have done it , and done it well			0
" said the adviser : " the polls had him up			0
that was residual name @entity160			0
but he ca n't carry that for a year			0
it would have been a fight			0
" at the friday meeting , aides were given assignments to start pulling together operational plans			0
advisers also concluded that it would be smart to launch some kind of political action committee to begin raising money and send a message to donors that his interest was more than just a @entity180 act			0
" people said , ' we have to get ready to take the next step , ' " said one adviser			0
" if he is not ready to run , we need to announce a committee , because we have to start raising money and sending a message to people			0
" but when there was no follow - up from @entity1 this week , people began to wonder if he might be pulling back			1
according to @entity17 , his father came to the conclusion that he was " unlikely " to enter the race that weekend , but wanted to sit on the decision for a few days			0
3 clues from @entity1 's day in @entity195 that he was n't going to run many of @entity1 's supporters say his decision to opt out by no means takes him out of the race entirely			1
@entity202 adviser @entity201 said that @entity1 believes " the best role for him is to help formulate the message and help the winner of the primary process deliver that message			1
" " i think he came to the conclusion that while yes , he can win the primary , yes , he can raise the dough , perhaps he can beat mrs. @entity213 , there 's an easier path to winning the presidency if @entity1 does n't get involved but stays above it as the most popular @entity9 in the country , " @entity209 said			1
but @entity219 , @entity1 's top @entity113 strategist , said the governor had arrived at the conclusion that it was time to step aside and let others take up the party mantle			1
" i think having run before , he understands how grueling it is			0
he knows it would be a challenging primary			0
knowing what we went through in 2012 , i think he decided it was time for other voices to be heard			0
" @entity1 mentioned the need for other voices to be heard in the bowing - out statement he read to supporters on a conference call friday			2
but implicit in his words was a critique of @entity56 , not exactly the new face @entity1 was describing as his preferred nominee			2
" i believe that one of our next generation of @entity9 leaders , one who may not be as well known as i am today , one who has not yet taken their message across the country , one who is just getting started , may well emerge as being better able to defeat the @entity249 nominee , " @entity1 said			2
" in fact , i expect and hope that to be the case			0
" @entity1 and @entity56 have a cordial relationship but are not close			2
@entity1 's advisers have said that the 2012 nominee is skeptical that the mild - mannered @entity56 , who last ran for political office almost a decade ago , is ready for the grindhouse of a modern campaign and the media scrutiny that comes with it			1
still , it was @entity56 who outmaneuvered @entity1 in the early stages of the so - called " invisible primary , " lining up donors and well - regarded staff talent with haste			2
his hire of @entity51 , formerly @entity1 's top strategist in @entity112 , blindsided @entity1 this week			2
@entity56 's swift behind - the - scenes maneuvering , which his advisers have described as a " shock and awe " strategy , rattled @entity1 once he caught wind of it in early january			1
the @entity56 activity prompted @entity1 to announce his interest in the race three weeks ago and " freeze " donors in place as he thought through the practicalities of another campaign			2
but it became clear that many of his former financial supporters and staffers were not only moving to @entity56 , but also other candidates vying for mainstream @entity9 support , including @entity286 gov. @entity285 , @entity288 sen. @entity287 and @entity290 gov. @entity289			0
@entity1 's decision to pull back on a campaign gives renewed life to all of them , said @entity295 , a @entity9 fundraiser			1
" with @entity1 out , the field is back open and it emboldens other candidates who are trying to be the @entity299 , " he said			2
" who is going to be the alternative to @entity56 and @entity302 on the right ? "			0
