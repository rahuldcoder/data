-- the world of @entity2 , the iconic role - playing game that has captivated millions since the 1970s , is more than just rolling dice on a table top			1
in 2014 , it is computer games , books , online comics , miniature figurines and more , aimed at staying relevant in a digital age			2
@entity12 , the publishers of the game , is launching the latest version along with a massive campaign called tyranny of @entity18			1
but on such a plethora of platforms , how is it possible to create an overarching idea that transcends platforms ? the publishers say it 's a simple concept known as sharing			0
the high adventure , in which followers of dragon queen @entity29 aim to take over the world , coincides with the release of the fifth edition of rules for tabletop version of @entity2			1
but the company wanted to expand how players could join in the new storyline and create a community of shared experiences			0
" the big part of a role - playing game is , you can do whatever you want			0
but we want you to end up at the same place at the end of the adventure , " said @entity44 , senior manager for @entity2 research and development			2
" there are many ways to get there , but having a big event that brings everybody back together is part of the fun , because once you 've gone up against @entity29 , you 've got something you can talk to any fellow player about , even if you 've never met that person before			0
" the idea of creating that shared story experience over different media meant @entity44 had to think about the narrative differently			0
it was more about creating a story bible with direction on how various creatures behave in certain circumstances rather than plotting out each monster 's actions specifically			0
40 years later , ' @entity2 ' still inspiring gamers " each one has a different way they act , a different goal they have , " @entity44 said			2
" so when you encounter it in a ( massively multiplayer online game ) , you can understand this creature , you can understand what it 's doing , because when i 'm fighting in a @entity86 action environment as opposed to a board game as opposed to a role - playing game , it has a trait that can shine through			1
" the massively multiplayer online version , " @entity91 , " will also feature the " @entity92 " story			1
@entity94 , executive producer at @entity95 , said his co-workers constantly talk with the creative teams at @entity12 well in advance of any new elements in the online version			1
having those discussions not only allows for swapping of ideas , it gives a cohesiveness in the look and feel of the game , he said			0
@entity94 said the sharing of creative elements also frees up his team to focus more on the online - only elements of stories , finding ways to draw certain players deeper into adventures			2
for example , creatures that will be appearing in the new " @entity117 " have been created at @entity12 for its upcoming tome			2
those creatures are designed by @entity12 graphic artists and have been rendered in a variety of resolutions to allow them to be used in a digital game , in a book or as templates for miniature figures			1
the player 's actions in the online campaign will be overlaid on those in the game 's more traditional tabletop campaign			1
" it 's really about getting in there and having fun and playing @entity2 , " @entity94 said of the online game			1
" if it feels like @entity2 , it is @entity2			2
" the cohesiveness is n't limited to just game play			2
" @entity144 " is an online comic developed by @entity142 with the blessing of @entity12			1
the @entity2 comic spun out of @entity142 's other creation , " @entity150 , " with the introduction of a supporting character named @entity149			1
@entity149 believes she is a dwarven fighter from " @entity2 " and acts out events in her non-gaming life as if she were the character			0
@entity142 said his team consults with @entity12 to go over upcoming campaign materials so everything flows from a central game plan			1
' @entity2 ' tries to lure back players " they are very good in guiding us away from what other authors are doing so we do n't step on toes , and they always are wonderful with suggestions , bibles , artwork , etc , " @entity142 said			0
" but for the most part , they just sit back and watch us go			0
they really do n't do more than say ' here are some amazing toys ; go play ! ' " @entity142 said that playing @entity2 with his father as a child helped him in his career by creating the first characters and stories he would later transport into his comics			1
he 's thrilled , he says , to work hand - in - hand with the people now creating the game he grew up playing			0
" we promote @entity2 by nature of our comic being about that game , and they promote ' @entity144 ' in social media and at personal events because they love the strip , " @entity142 said			1
" the business team calls that synergy , and the creatives call it ' mutual admiration			0
' " @entity44 said that sharing between media keeps the focus on what 's always been at the heart of @entity2 : the story			2
" it does create that community sense of shared experience , shared story , even though everyone 's story experience was unique , " he said			0
" you can be whoever you want			0
you can do whatever you want			0
