the @entity10 held a silent march for @entity12 in @entity6 , @entity7			2
the chase through @entity6 's streets in the predawn hours of october 3 has also raised the issue of whether a national stun gun policy is needed , a civil rights group said			1

initial " exam findings do not mention any taser probes on the body , " said @entity38 , director of the medical examiners office			0
even though the teenager was not electrocuted by the stun gun , the incident has brought questions from some about safety procedures when it comes to using the weapons			1

after the meeting , the department changed its policy			2
" effective immediately , firing a taser from a moving vehicle or into a moving vehicle is prohibited , " a @entity6 police memo said			2
before @entity12 's death , the department 's policy required that officers act " professionally " and that stun gun use be " reasonable			1
" " if it had not been for the reckless use of the @entity76 gun , this tragic accident could have been avoided , " said @entity84 of the @entity10			0
