when i grew up , i saw them working so hard , and then deep inside myself that i wanted to change the situation , i wanted to make something , this one thing			0
@entity9 : what do you think are the most important qualities for a businessperson ? @entity3 : for me , it 's most important , a vision , determination , and to never say no to yourself			1
and be open to criticisms , open to learning , and open to criticisms and knowing nothing about the business ; nothing , so you can learn everything by knowing nothing , you know , and be successful in the things that you did n't know			0

i told them , do things that i did n't ask you , give me , do your work with passion , it 's more important than " oh , 6 o'clock , i have to leave			0
" do something that is out of the box			0
