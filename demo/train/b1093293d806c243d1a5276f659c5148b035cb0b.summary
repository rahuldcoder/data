-- if you doubt there 's a dental health crisis in @entity4 , walk into any emergency room			1
every day , thousands of people without access to a dentist are looking for dental care in our ers , most of which can not provide the care these patients need			1
we 're experiencing this alarming trend right here in @entity18 , @entity19			0
for example , one of our local hospitals , the @entity20 , finds that about 10 % of @entity12 cases are related to dental issues			1
nationally , more than 2.1 million people , the vast majority of them adults , showed up in ers with dental pain in 2010 , double the number just a decade prior , according to the @entity31			2
those er visits for largely preventable issues cost the health system more than $ 2 billion that year			0
and the majority of dental er visits , nearly 80 % , were for common and preventable conditions like abscesses and cavities			0
the reason for this ? the percentage of working - age adults -- particularly young adults -- with private dental benefits continues to decline			1
and more than half of lower - income adults say they have n't seen a dentist in a year or longer			2
so patients go without proper cleaning and examinations and end up at the er when a problem strikes			0
but most ers are not staffed or equipped to diagnose and treat dental problems			1
typically , they provide antibiotics and pain medication only			0
this results in patients returning to the @entity12 to treat the same dental issues as soon as the pain returns			2
unfortunately , the @entity62 will provide little relief			1
the new law has no substantive dental provisions for low - income adults , despite the fact that dental health is critical to overall health			1
dental crisis could create ' state of decay ' what 's the solution ? foremost , it 's prevention			0
we need programs to get patients proper preventive care			2
and when patients have dental issues that need immediate attention , they need access to a dentist to treat the underlying problem			2
the good news is that we are beginning to tackle this issue , one hospital er at a time			0
i 've seen it in my hometown of @entity18 , and it may be happening in yours , too			0
hospitals and dentists across the country are collaborating on programs that address this issue at the community level , offering models other communities can replicate			1
@entity18 's @entity20 has one such program			0
recognizing that dental emergencies are better handled in a dental office , @entity102 created a program to refer these patients to staff dentists			1
the hospital covers the cost of care if the patient is uninsured			0
the end result : the dental patients get the care they need , and the hospital is able to free up the @entity12 staff to handle more urgent emergencies , saving time and money			2
other communities are creating their own @entity12 referral programs			1
at @entity124 's @entity123 , about one in five patient visits to the emergency department involved dental pain			2
to relieve the strain on its facilities , @entity126 created an in - house dental clinic that offers screenings and preventive care , with local dentists providing treatments such as fillings and extractions at substantially reduced fees			1
to qualify , patients must not have seen a dentist in the past 12 months and must meet certain federal income requirements			0
most patients pay $ 10 to $ 20 for a dental visit , but no one is turned away if they ca n't			2
the @entity144 hospital system in @entity145 , @entity146 , is partnering with a local nonprofit , @entity147 , on a program that refers patients suffering from dental pain from the @entity12 to dentists			1
since the program began , dental cases in the @entity12 have dropped by 70 %			0
the dental screening that could save your life more than 60 % of the community 's private practice dentists have signed on to provide free treatment , resulting in more than $ 1 million in care donated to 4,000 people			0
in return for care , patients volunteer service hours with local organizations , giving back to the surrounding community			0
all @entity4 deserve good dental health , and we need more collaborative approaches like these to take on @entity4 's dental crisis			0
that 's why dentists are working with health and community leaders across the @entity4 through @entity174 , the @entity177 's nationwide , community - based movement to provide care now to people suffering with dental disease , strengthen the public - private safety net and bring disease prevention and dental health education into underserved communities			1
the campaign comprises numerous initiatives , each with specific goals , one of which is to implement @entity12 referral programs in all 50 states by 2020			1
with bold goals like this and a commitment to join together locally and nationally , we can all but eliminate routine dental problems clogging ers by providing the right care in the right place : the dental chair			1
