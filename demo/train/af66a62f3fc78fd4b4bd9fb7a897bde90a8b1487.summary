-- if you want a place to see the majestic sweep of the @entity4 -- or even any star at night -- then put @entity6 at the bottom of your must - visit list			1
the local urban night sky is as much as 1,000 times brighter than international norms making it the most light polluted city in the world , according to a study by the faculty of science at the @entity17			1
much more than the romantic flicker of neon through a bedroom window , @entity6 residents now have to contend with shopping precincts that are lit up like football stadiums and golf driving ranges that rise like daybreak on the horizon			0
study leader @entity28 said the group could find no other place on the planet that was as light polluted as @entity6			1
" @entity6 is an extremely densely populated place which is why the city has such a severe problem , " he told @entity0			2
however , he said unregulated lighting on buildings and the @entity6 government 's obsession with providing public safety had made the city world 's biggest light trap			2
" in @entity6 , the government tends to play things on the safe side , " he said			0
" certainly , i 'm all for safety -- these are extremely important issues -- on the other hand , when you go near some public places , city parks for instance , they are lit up like the daytime in the evening			0
" i think some of it is simply overdoing it , " @entity55 said			0
he said of particular concern was spotlighting that was directed at the sky to create a dramatic effect			0
unlike other major world cities -- among them @entity64 and @entity65 -- @entity6 has no laws controlling urban lighting			0
the study found that even rural areas of @entity6 , including the nearby island of @entity71 and the city 's @entity72 to the north -- a world famous staging post for migratory birds -- were also being affected by man made lighting			2
the @entity72 was on average 100 times brighter than the standard , the study found			1
the international standard for night skies is set by the @entity85 and refers to a night sky unaffected by man made lighting			0
ironically , @entity6 's most light polluted place was the @entity90 at @entity91 which was more than 1,000 times brighter than international norms due to the large number of billboards and floodlights nearby			1
developed by physicists at the @entity17 , the study -- @entity6 night @entity98 ( @entity99 ) -- took more than 5 million night sky brightness measurements over a period of nearly three years			1
the study team said it now has the largest database on night sky brightness in the world			0
even measurements at @entity6 's @entity108 observatory , located deep in @entity109 , showed problems of light pollution			1
" even though the @entity114 was the darkest station in our study , its night sky is still at least 20 times brighter than the international dark sky standard before 11pm , " @entity55 said			2
" light pollution is swiftly destroying the few remaining star - gazing locations in @entity6			1
" while the study started looking at light pollution from an astronomer 's perspective , ecologists also joined the project to gauge the impact of light pollution on wildlife			1
" there have been many studies showing definitively that wasteful light has a big ecological impact , in particular for nocturnal animals that depend on the amount of light to regulate their lives			0
it 's part of the reason why we set up a station near the @entity72 because it 's such an ecologically important area , " @entity55 said			0
nevertheless , for @entity142 who runs the astronomy club at @entity144 -- a senior secondary school whose rooftop observatory in @entity6 's @entity147 is in one of the brightest areas of the city -- the problem of light pollution is overstated			1
" the sky is bright , no doubt , but the brightness is caused by the particles in the air not directly by the surrounding light , " @entity142 said			0
" we have very polluted air in @entity6 and we have a lot of floating particles in the air and these floating particles reflect light back into our eyes -- this is why we feel the sky is so bright at night			2
" he said modern filters on the telescope can obviate the problems of light refracted by the particles			0
" the major problem for us is n't city lights , it 's clouds , " he said , adding that @entity6 has more than 200 cloudy nights a year .			1

@entity17 study finds @entity6 is the most light polluted city on @entity177
two - year study finds parts of city to be 1,000 times above international standards
*author* says upward pointing lights and advertising hoarding add to light pollution
even remote parts of @entity6 are as much as 100 times international norms
