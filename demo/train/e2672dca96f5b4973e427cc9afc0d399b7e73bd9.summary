@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration hailed @entity5 's declaration of its nuclear program as a success for the multilateral diplomacy it engaged in through the six party talks with @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
workers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at @entity5 's @entity19 nuclear facility this year			0
in fact , @entity5 's confessions of many of its nuclear sins -- and its shutdown of its nuclear reactor at @entity19 -- are the closest the international community has come to curbing @entity5 's nuclear program			0
as a result of @entity30 's handover of the 60 - page declaration document -- and friday 's expected destruction of the cooling tower at @entity19 -- president @entity3 ordered some sanctions against @entity5 lifted and instructed the @entity35 to remove the reclusive communist nation from @entity38 lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism			1
but as important as what the document says is what it does n't say			0
there is no mention of how many weapons @entity5 has or where they are hidden			0
nor did @entity5 admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with @entity51			1
both issues are reduced in the declaration to " concerns " @entity30 promises to address down the road			1
@entity3 and secretary of state @entity56 have pledged a robust verification process to double - check @entity5 's claims			2
and @entity5 has promised to allow @entity38 inspectors access to the @entity19 facility and to interview its nuclear experts			1
but it is far from clear whether @entity30 will allow the kind of intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear arsenal that the @entity38 will need to get a complete picture of @entity5 's program			1
congressional republicans not so sure about @entity30 the stiffest opposition to the deal is coming from conservative @entity73			2
once considered president @entity3 's strongest allies in confronting @entity5 's nuclear ambition , they feel that the @entity3 administration has let @entity5 off the hook , especially when it comes to its enriched uranium program and suspected proliferation to @entity51			1
rep. @entity82 , @entity83 , the top @entity73 on the @entity84 , expressed " profound disappointment " over @entity3 's announcement that @entity5 would be coming off the lists of enemies and state sponsors of terrorism			1
and rep. @entity91 , @entity92 , the top @entity73 on the @entity93 , accused president @entity3 of sacrificing its principles for a foreign policy success			2
" a decision seemingly has been made that it is more important for the @entity98 to reach a legacy agreement than to get to the bottom of @entity5 's nuclear efforts , " @entity91 said			2
" lifting sanctions and removing @entity5 from the list of state sponsors of terrorism flies in the face of history and rewards its brutal dictator for shallow gestures			0
" rep. @entity110 , @entity111 , called @entity5 's declaration late and incomplete , alleging that @entity5 built a nuclear facility for @entity51 , considered a terrorist state by the @entity38 , while the nuclear negotiations were ongoing			1
that , he said , was proof that @entity30 ca n't be trusted			0
" how do you have a meaningful declaration of your nuclear program without saying how many bombs you have ? " @entity110 asked			0
" this is a signal to other proliferating regimes that nuclear weapons will be rewarded without ever having to give them up			0
" democrats , who once criticized @entity3 for not talking directly to @entity5 about its nuclear program , are cautiously supportive of the deal			1
@entity129 , the @entity130 chairman of the @entity84 , called the @entity5 's submission of a declaration " encouraging			0
" even former presidential candidate sen. @entity133 , @entity134 , praised the @entity3 administration , saying " engaging our enemies can pay dividends			1
" but @entity133 added , " historians will long wonder why this administration did not directly engage @entity5 before @entity30 gathered enough material for several nuclear weapons , tested a nuclear device and the missiles to deliver them			1
" are we headed down the same road with @entity146 ? in his 2002 @entity147 , @entity3 termed @entity148 , @entity5 and @entity146 the " axis of evil , " saying they were " arming to threaten the peace of the world			1
" fourteen months after delivering that speech -- and after dictator @entity154 released a 12,000 - page declaration that it had no weapons of mass destruction -- @entity38 forces invaded @entity148			0
but no such program was found , nor were stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction			0
more than five years into the war , the @entity38 is still battling @entity165 and @entity148 insurgents there			0
six - party talks with @entity5 began in 2003 , after @entity5 withdrew from the @entity168			0
@entity169 was limited until 2007 , when @entity5 agreed to shut down @entity19 and allow international monitors back into the country for monitoring and verification			0
progress has been even more limited for the third member of the " axis of evil , " @entity146			0
the @entity3 administration has joined the other members of the @entity179 -- @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity12 and @entity14 , along with @entity182 -- in offering @entity146 a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones @entity5 was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program			1
but the @entity38 has refused to sit down with @entity146 until that suspension takes place			2
the @entity179 has passed three resolutions imposing sanctions against @entity146 , and the @entity38 has worked with some success to isolate @entity146 from the international financial community			2
but unlike @entity5 , which is isolated and desperately in need of international aid , @entity146 is rich in oil and a powerful force in the @entity198			2
and it 's only getting richer and more immune to sanctions as oil prices skyrocket			0
and @entity146 seems to be running out the clock and waiting to try its luck with a new @entity38 president			2
sen. @entity204 , the presumptive @entity130 nominee , has pledged to engage @entity146 in direct talks to try to curb its nuclear ambitions			0
sen. @entity207 , the presumptive @entity73 nominee , has taken a much tougher line , refusing to rule out military action to prevent a nuclear - armed @entity146			1
with the coming change in the @entity38 administration , @entity38 officials , diplomats and other @entity146 experts believe that it would be at least eight months to a year before the @entity38 and @entity146 could seriously think about talking			1
meanwhile , by its own admission , @entity146 continues to perfect its nuclear technology			0
if the @entity5 experience can serve as a lesson for the next @entity38 president , that lesson may well be that the longer the @entity38 waits to talk to @entity146 , the higher the cost will be to get @entity222 out of the nuclear business .			1

just as important as what the nuclear declaration says is what it does n't say
@entity5 did n't admit to uranium enrichment or sharing secrets with @entity51
many @entity73 say @entity3 administration has let @entity30 off the hook
@entity38 may be headed down the same road with @entity146
