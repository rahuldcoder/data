@entity0 is a role model , say her defenders			1
the chief operating officer of @entity3 earned two degrees from @entity5 and spent the early part of her career in public service , rising to become chief of staff to treasury secretary @entity10 during the latter days of the @entity12 administration			1
she helped build @entity13 into a powerhouse ; she has led the @entity3 team in making the social media site ubiquitous			1
she 's a mother who cares deeply about work - life balance and has been outspoken about women pulling together			1
@entity0 is no role model , say her detractors			1
she 's glided to the top thanks to the help of powerful men , whether it 's the patronage of @entity10 , @entity13 chairman @entity24 or @entity3 founder @entity25			1
she 's worth hundreds of millions of dollars , lives in an exclusive @entity27 suburb with a staff of minders and knows as much about being a working mother as a @entity32 socialite			2
one thing 's for sure : @entity0 is in the crosshairs			1
the myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career her new book , " @entity39 : women , work , and the @entity47 to lead , " is out monday , and her arguments , focusing on how women in the workplace can grow their careers and their lives , have attracted both praise and denunciation -- though , as the @entity51 's @entity50 has noted , many of the denouncers have jumped on @entity0 in the " ready , fire , aim " fashion typical of the commentariat			1
" anyone who had read her book would have known that @entity0 herself is the first to acknowledge the debts she owes to the women who came before her , not to mention her youthful naivete and eventual engagement with gender politics , " @entity50 wrote			1
so just who is @entity0 , and why are people saying such extreme things about her ? a woman in @entity71 's boys ' club she 's a rarity , for one			1
the @entity71 culture , as @entity74 observed in a thoughtful 2011 profile of @entity0 , remains male - dominated			1
as a woman , @entity0 has had to find her way among a boys ' club not always friendly to her sex , though colleagues such as @entity83 's @entity82 , once of @entity13 herself , may be helping change that			1
at its core the tech industry is still a land of engineers -- coders and designers who put in endless caffeine - fueled hours trying to perfect the next cool thing , while the marketers and financial types are one step removed			2
indeed , that was one reason @entity25 hired her : she " handles things i do n't want to , " he told @entity74 , so he can focus on his strengths			0
@entity0 , 43 , was born in @entity101 , and raised in south @entity102			2
her father is an ophthalmologist and her mother gave up teaching to raise @entity0 and two siblings			2
the family 's passion was supporting @entity109 jews -- the " refuseniks " -- and their house became a meeting place for the movement			0
as a child , @entity0 sent letters to a @entity109 " twin , " @entity117 , who developed a network of correspondents			2
" i remember feeling when i was writing these girls , and they were writing me , that we had the same issues , " @entity117 told @entity120 last year			0
" they wrote about the same stuff i was feeling			0
" it 's that kind of support group that @entity0 stresses in " @entity39			1
" how do you balance work and family ? share your story with @entity132 in a @entity134 talk that echoes some of the material in the book , @entity0 mentioned that it 's hard enough to succeed in a male - dominated world as a female businesswoman			1
in fact , there was one office , she observed , where she may have been the first woman to pitch a deal to a particular firm ; the firm 's partner did n't even know where the women 's restroom was			2
add to that the stresses of motherhood and it 's no surprise she wants to offer encouragement to other working women , without sugar - coating the advice			1
among the book 's chapter titles are " @entity160 , " " it 's a @entity162 , not a ladder " and " @entity163 of doing it all			2
" @entity166 business professor @entity165 , a pioneer in her own right -- she was a full - time professor and a corporate executive when it was unusual for women to lead companies -- agrees that " doing it all " is a mirage			1
" i think this thing about ' can women have it all ? ' or ' ca n't they have it all ? ' is kind of a silly argument , " she said			0
" yes , you may have it all , but not all at once			0
" moreover , she adds , success is n't to be measured by how many women become corporate ceos , but by how much leeway women have to make their own choices			0
in her @entity134 talk , @entity0 stresses the same point , emphasizing that choice does n't often come without compromise , the kind that men are n't always asked to make			2
women , she said , have " to believe we got the @entity193 , to reach for the promotion , to sit at the table , " she said			0
" and we have to do it in a world where , for them , there are sacrifices they will make for that , even though for their brothers , there are not			0
" ' i never thought i would write a book ' oh , that 's easy for @entity0 to say , say her critics			1
sure , she 's worked hard , but she 's had a gilded life			0
indeed , @entity0 has regularly been at the head of her class			2
@entity212 , impressed by her work in his @entity5 economics class , became her adviser and took her along when he joined the @entity217			0
she left that job two years later , in 1993 , to join the prominent @entity220 consultancy			0
she earned an mba from @entity222 , rejoined @entity10 as part of the @entity12 administration , and was recruited by @entity13 's @entity24 to join @entity13 in 2001 , when the company was just taking off -- a process she drove by improving the reach of @entity228 and @entity229 , two of @entity13 's major moneymakers			0
now , as coo of @entity3 , she has been part of another phenomenon , a company that now claims more than a billion users			1
@entity0 holds close to 2 million @entity3 shares and has options on millions more , according to the company 's 2012 stock filing			1
she and her husband , @entity242 ceo @entity241 , share a brand - new 9,000 - square - foot mansion			0
so of course she can leave work at 5:30 to take care of her two kids			0
after all , she 's the boss			0
but for all her apparent wealth and power -- for all her success -- @entity0 appears to remain the rather retiring person she was in high school and college , the kind of person who " did not speak or raise her hand , " writes @entity74			1
" i never thought i would write a book , " she says in " @entity39			1
" she decided to do so only after years of discussion with colleagues			0
she defines " leaning in " as " being ambitious , " and it 's an assertion she appears to make hesitantly because the stakes are so large			0
now that " @entity39 " is out , said @entity264 business professor @entity263 , @entity0 should use her bully pulpit to push workplace changes -- not just for women , but men as well			1
the typical workplace is the way it is because we accept our endless days and constant deadlines as the norm			0
we need less rigidity , more creativity , more room for work - life balance , she said			0
" the problem is n't about fixing the women			0
the problem is about gender roles and dynamics and the expectations and norms that exist in the workplace , " she said			0
" as long as we keep emphasizing how to fix the women , i do n't think we 're going to get very far			0
" @entity166 's @entity165 agreed that @entity0 can help change the dialogue			1
" absolutely @entity0 is right to encourage women to have more self - confidence , " she said			1
" but i also think it 's wrong to define success for women in terms of how many @entity294 we can produce			2
what is more critical is what can we change to make the balance less difficult for that much larger host of women who work not for self - fulfillment , but because they have to			1
" for now , though , @entity0 has made her statement			2
as for all the criticism ? something she told @entity74 two years ago suggests she 's probably wondering why all the fuss is about her , and not the bigger issues			2
" i feel really grateful to the people who encouraged me and helped me develop , " she said			0
" nobody can succeed on their own			0
" opinion : working moms , do n't try to be perfect at home			0

@entity3 coo @entity0 's first book , " @entity39 , " is out monday
book deals with working - women *'d* issues , has put @entity0 under fire
@entity0 was always a high achiever , whether in school , government or business
will book change dialogue on workplace issues ? or is @entity0 an outlier ?
