@entity0 -- @entity2 was rescued last week from more than 10 years in captivity , but her family still does n't know exactly where she is			1
there were joyous reunions for @entity2 and @entity2 after they were freed from the @entity0 home where police say @entity2 held them captive			1
but a level of mystery surrounds @entity2 , who was rescued along with the others , but who has apparently not been reunited with her family			1
even as of friday night , @entity2 had n't spoken yet with her mother , @entity15 , a family spokesperson said			1
in fact , @entity2 's family had no idea where she was and had asked police for information on her whereabouts			1
@entity2 , a 52 - year - old bus driver and musician , faces charges of rape and kidnapping in connection with the prolonged captivity of the women			1
what little is known about @entity2 's whereabouts comes from a source close to the investigation , who told @entity1 that @entity2 " is in a safe place and very comfortable			1
" the source did not specify further			0
there were reports that @entity2 was at the @entity37 home , and there was a lot of activity there saturday morning , but @entity2 was not there			1
her grandmother , @entity43 , had gone to the same home on friday because she 'd also heard @entity2 might be there and " besides , @entity46 's parents here have been waiting to meet us			1
" other questions surround @entity2 , whose disappearance generated far less publicity and attention than did those of @entity54 and @entity37			2
@entity0 police removed @entity2 's name from an @entity58 database of missing people in november 2003 -- 15 months after her family reported her missing -- police said			2
they did so after " failing to locate a parent , guardian or other reporting person to confirm that ms. @entity2 was still missing			2
" police said , though , that her missing person 's case remained open and was checked on as recently as november 2012			0
@entity0 police have been subject to intense criticism from some quarters over their handling of missing persons cases , but city officials have said they did everything they could to find the missing women			0
@entity2 was discharged from @entity0 's @entity77 , hospital spokeswoman @entity76 said friday , hours after the hospital said in a @entity78 posting that she was in " good spirits " and " extremely grateful " for the flowers , gifts and the support of the @entity83			2
the latter is a vehicle for raising that helps nonprofit organizations provide services to the three women			0
@entity54 and @entity37 were released days ago and are now staying with relatives			0
the @entity0 public relations firm of @entity92 is representing all three women , said @entity94 of that company			2
@entity94 said that her firm of crisis management specialists is working pro bono after being " asked to help them out , " joining a team of like - minded individuals that includes lawyers and counselors			0
the rescued women , none of whom have spoken publicly since being freed , are set to issue a full statement at 10 a.m. sunday , according to @entity94			1
according to initial police report , the women told investigators that they were chained in the basement of the home , but later moved upstairs to rooms on the second floor			0
they were allowed out of the home only twice , and then just briefly , according to the document			0
@entity2 would frequently test the women by pretending to leave and then discipline any of them if they had moved , according to a law enforcement source			1
meanwhile , the @entity58 is continuing the process of sealing off and boarding up the areas near the home of the alleged captor that they have checked for evidence			1
on saturday morning they were boarding up and closing off an abandoned house to the right of @entity2 's home			2
the abandoned house had been searched thursday , and authorities were seen removing evidence from that home			1
the neighbors continued to express their shock to learn that three girls were prisoners so near to their own homes			0
no one imagined that @entity2 could have been living a double life			2
" this dude was cool , i 'm telling you , " @entity2 , a neighbor hailed as a hero for helping @entity2 escape , told radio host @entity142 of @entity144 on saturday			0
" this type of cat you 'd put in your car ... just because you want someone to talk to , " @entity2 said			0
" you will ride him around and waste gas with this dude			0
" @entity1 's @entity153 reported this story from @entity0 ; @entity155 wrote it in @entity157			0
@entity1 's @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 contributed to this report .			0
