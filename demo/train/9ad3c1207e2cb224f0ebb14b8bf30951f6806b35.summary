@entity0 -- the pristine waters of the @entity0 , a glittering necklace of coralline and granitic islands scattered on the @entity6 , have long beguiled jet - setters and eco-conscious visitors from around the world , turning the idyllic archipelago into a popular travel destination			1
but as well as boosting the tiny nation 's tourism revenues , the high seas off the east coast of @entity14 have also helped create another strategic industry : fishing			1
a major economic pillar , fishing is the second biggest contributor to the @entity0 ' finances after tourism			1
over the last two decades , the sector 's products have accounted for more than 90 % of the country 's merchandise exports by value , supplying international markets with items such as canned tuna , also known as the @entity0 ' " blue gold			1
" but in recent years , the fishing industry has come under severe threat as a result of the ongoing risk posed by @entity38 pirates roaming the waters off the @entity40			1
" it 's a big problem , " explains major @entity41 , deputy operations officer of the @entity0 coast guard			1
" anything that disrupts the tourism or fishing industry or the maritime equilibrium is a very big problem for us , " he adds			1
read this : the global cost of piracy to deal with the threat of piracy , the country 's authorities had to change the way they manage their waters in recent years			1
as part of this increased security drive , the @entity0 coast guard has intensified its patrolling efforts , with fast - attack armed vessels monitoring a newly defined zone for fishing			1
but there are just four such vessels in the @entity0 ' entire fleet			2
it 's a small nation in terms of landmass , but with its oceans , it is nearly twice the size of @entity74			2
" this is not adequate to cover such a large area , " says @entity41			0
" we need more assets and build up more our capacity to deal with the issue			0
" local fishermen are restricted from sailing beyond the designated area 's perimeter , several dozen miles outside the main port			2
analysts say that fishing boats are of particular importance to pirates because they can be used as floating bases from which to launch further attacks			1
but while the measure seems to be working -- there have been no successful attacks in nearly a year -- the restrictions on the movement of @entity0 fishermen has created another problem			1
" there 's no fish , " explains local fisherman @entity99			0
" every boat is fishing in the same place , " he adds			0
@entity99 , who 's been casting his nets for 12 years now , says his job was hardest during the worst period of the piracy -- in 2007 and 2008			2
since then , the @entity0 has been at the forefront of the global fight against piracy but the new rules mean fewer fish and less money			1
latest @entity14 gold rush : hotels @entity116 is the general manager of the @entity74 - owned @entity117 , one of the world 's largest tuna canneries and the biggest employer in the @entity0			1
he says fish intake has fallen nearly 25 % in the last five years			0
" the impact has been on the price , which for some places has gone up by 70 % -80 % compared to 2007 prices , " explains @entity116			0
according to a recent report by the @entity129 , piracy costs the global economy an estimated $ 18 billion a year			0
the increased costs come as shippers are forced to change trading routes , sending fuel bills soaring , as well as pay higher insurance premiums and security bills for guards on board			0
but the threat of @entity38 piracy is also damaging the economies of neighboring countries , particularly in the key sectors of tourism and fishing			1
since 2006 , the year the @entity129 report takes as the starting point of piracy , exports of fish products from piracy - hit countries have declined by 23.8 %			0
in @entity0 , the impact has been even greater , with exports collapsing by nearly 30 %			2
" we now fish where we are allowed to fish , " says @entity154 , the country 's minister of natural resources and industry			2
" it has made the industry more costly in terms of going out there [ and ] be secure to bring in what usually was our daily supply of protein , " he adds			0
watch video : protecting " blue gold " from pirates and although many of the pirates have now gone , the fishermen say their industry still has n't recovered			2
for people like @entity99 , the fight against piracy and the introduction of fishing zones has proven to be a double - edged sword			2
the protection is still necessary , he says , acknowledging that today he is safer			0
yet , he and other local fishermen miss the freedom to sail about and return with a big catch			0
" five years ago , there was a lot of fish , " says @entity99			0
" we could go anywhere we wanted without the fear of piracy and everything			0
" @entity190 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 ' fishermen have been targets of @entity38 pirates
piracy forced authorities to introduce zones that restrict fishermen 's movements
attacks have decreased , but restrictions hurt fishing industry
