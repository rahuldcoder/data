@entity1 the @entity0 on friday agreed to take up a case concerning the lethal injection protocol that left an inmate in @entity6 to die slowly and gasping for breath last year			1
the case , which is likely to be heard this term , was brought by inmates who claim the state protocol violates the @entity12 's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and could open a new chapter in the ongoing battle over the patchwork system of execution procedures in the @entity18			1
" petitioners are pleased that the @entity0 will review their case , " said @entity19 , one of the attorneys representing the death row inmates			2
in a statement , @entity19 said that the protocol is " not capable of producing a humane execution , even if administered properly			0
" an original plaintiff in the case , @entity27 , was put to death last week			0
another plaintiff , @entity30 , is set to die on january 29			0

" @entity6 's execution protocol has been affirmed as constitutional by two federal courts and has successfully been implemented in @entity6 , as well as more than 10 similar executions in @entity49 , " he said			1
" we will continue to defend the constitutionality of this protocol in order to preserve @entity55 's ability to proceed with the sentences that were given to each inmate by a jury of their peers			2
" in 2008 -- in a case called @entity63 -- the court found @entity65 's lethal injection protocol constitutional , but since then , as they struggle to locate lethal injection drugs , many states have changed their protocols and have experimented with different drugs			1
in court papers , @entity19 asked the justices to take up the case to " revisit @entity63 because the lethal injection landscape has changed significantly in the last seven years			1

@entity101 recently abandoned the use @entity105 after the execution of @entity108			0
" what 's at issue here is the use of midazolam and whether it is at all appropriate for execution , " said @entity96			0
