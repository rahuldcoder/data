editor 's note : @entity2 is co-founder of @entity3 , a nonprofit organization that has produced six documentary films for national broadcast			1
he edited the @entity7 - winning book " @entity8 : @entity10 @entity9 reclaim their @entity11 , " and his television work has been nominated for @entity14 and emmy awards			1
@entity2 says new media give voice to @entity9 who were n't fully recognized by mainstream media			1
( @entity18 ) -- " the media is dying			2
" it 's the title of a @entity21 page and a prime topic of conversation among reporters			0
enter a room full of journalists , and you 'll hear constant anxious chatter about dying newspapers and massive layoffs at print publications			0
just one example : the @entity33 recently became the first major newspaper to cease its print edition and go exclusively online , after more than 150 years of chronicling the city 's history			0
as a writer who 's been in the game for years -- over 30 and counting -- i 'm challenged by all there is to learn and at times overwhelmed as i watch old media gradually head toward extinction			2
yet , as a @entity46 writer , i am excited by the world of new possibilities			2
why ? because i recognize that mastering the online world can unleash a great force to promote understanding among people			2
with all the focus on @entity59 and @entity9 in the news , the voices of @entity55 civic leaders , or even ordinary muslims going about their daily business , are too often missing in stories about their own communities here and abroad			1
why is it we so often hear what this or that expert thinks about @entity9 yet so rarely hear what @entity9 themselves think ? into this fray steps the @entity71			1
the soaring dominance of new media is an extremely important moment in the history of relations between @entity9 and their neighbors			1
for the first time , ordinary @entity9 can speak directly to their non-muslim neighbors -- and share their views on just about anything -- without the mainstream media as intermediaries selecting their talking heads , pundits and experts			1
muslims should seize this golden opportunity to communicate their stories and views directly to the world			2
take this recent example , a national online film contest called " @entity95 , @entity93			0
" the sponsors ( @entity96 and @entity95 , a nonprofit initiative ) challenged @entity10 to create their own short digital videos about what it means to be @entity46 in @entity10 today			0
now in its second year , the contest attracted more than 150 submissions , with close to 26,000 people voting online for their favorites			0
the entries provide a fascinating snapshot of what ordinary @entity10 @entity9 think about the present state of their community , from the grand - prize - winning " @entity111 in @entity10 " -- a spoof about the challenges of finding a job and blending in -- to the youth - category winner " @entity120 , " about a young scuba diver 's reverence for the natural world			1
why do films like this matter ? because comprehending how @entity59 values are expressed in @entity9 ' lives today is of central importance to the cause of peace and understanding and to realizing the promise of pluralism on which @entity10 and the global world is based			1
now , perhaps in the nick of time , the @entity71 offers @entity9 the chance to blog in their own words , tweet their reactions to a breaking news story or further progress in their own communities by exchanging ideas through online forums			1
this new reality is already playing out locally and globally			0
@entity46 bloggers like @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 are contributing to the marketplace of ideas online and sharing their perspectives on major breaking news stories			0
@entity9 in the @entity10 and around the world are reacting in real time when events like the @entity155 attacks happen , often to condemn the violence when some mainstream media pundits are busy saying that none of them cares , or worse			1
but conversations are n't one - sided ; they involve at least two parties			0
what does this mean ? it means that the opportunity @entity9 now have is shared with their neighbors			2
when a @entity46 goes online to blog about why she wears a headscarf , a @entity169 or @entity170 woman who is interested in the topic can ask her questions directly			0
sometimes it is geography that separates us , or sometimes we are too shy or embarrassed to ask questions or speak out when face - to - face			0
the @entity71 makes all of this much easier and unleashes unparalleled potential for humans to communicate directly with the rest of the world			0
for those , like @entity55 , who have often found themselves left out of mainstream media discourse , the possibilities are now vastly improved			0
the ultimate impact this will have on society at large remains to be seen , but with many ordinary @entity9 finally speaking for themselves , and people of other faiths taking part in the conversation , the future is looking brighter			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2
