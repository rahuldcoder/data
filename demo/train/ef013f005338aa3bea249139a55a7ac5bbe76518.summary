@entity0 -- @entity3 's daughter got her wish when a @entity0 judge appointed a conservator to oversee the 95 - year - old actress 's finances and medical care wednesday			1
judge asked to intervene in @entity3 's care but the man named temporary conservator is @entity3 's ninth husband , prince @entity13 , who has feuded with his stepdaughter @entity14 for years			1
@entity15 contended when she filed for the conservatorship in march that @entity13 kept her ailing mother " increasingly isolated " and " heavily sedated , " and she questions his handling of @entity3 's finances			1
@entity15 is satisfied , though , because the court order requires her stepfather to provide monthly financial reports and medical records , @entity15 lawyer @entity21 said			1
the @entity28 - born actress was once one of @entity30 's most glamorous women , but a broken hip and leg amputation in the past two years have left her confined to a bed			2
@entity3 's only child , the result of her marriage to @entity15 , will also get weekly visits with her mother without @entity13 present , the judge said			1
billionaire 's son arrested as wife found dead the arrangement is an improvement for @entity15 because it will " make sure @entity47 's money is used for @entity47 's benefit and not for anybody 's birthday party , billboards or mayoral campaign , " @entity21 said			1
@entity54 judge @entity53 , who also oversees singer @entity56 ' conservatorship , ordered an end to any powers of attorney @entity13 might claim that would have allowed him to sell @entity3 's @entity62 mansion or other estate assets			1
as conservator , he must send canceled checks and other financial records to @entity15 's lawyer each month			1
@entity68 can make spending decisions with some of the money , but he must get court approval to access one bank account , @entity21 said			0
@entity15 and @entity13 have battled publicly for several years over @entity3 's finances and her access to her mother			1
" he 's basically taken my mother away from me , " @entity15 told @entity1 in an interview a year ago			2
@entity78 accused of ' slavery and torture ' @entity68 , in an interview with @entity1 , said he limits his stepdaughter 's access because she brings negativity into the room			0
" i want smiling people in here			0
@entity88 , smiling people , " he said			0
he defended his care of @entity3 , saying , " i 'm going to make sure she has a good life , as long as i live , i will take care of her			2
" @entity68 , 68 , maintains a high media profile , including a run for governor of @entity96 in 2010 that he halted after his wife 's hip injury			0
he is currently an announced candidate for mayor of @entity0			0
he made news several years ago when he claimed to be the father of @entity103 's daughter after the actress 's death			2
paternity tests later disproved that claim			0
official : mother abandons disabled daughter last year , @entity13 announced that he wanted @entity3 to become a mother again using an egg donor , artificial insemination and a surrogate mother			1
" that 's just weird , " @entity15 said at the time			2
" i 'm a retired guy , " @entity13 said then			0
" i can take care of it			0
" the unusual motherhood plan was never hatched			0
@entity68 is 27 years younger than @entity3 , whom he married more than 25 years ago			2
the conservatorship agreement , reached through mediation , expires in january when the judge will revisit the case , the lawyer said .			0

@entity14 is happy with conservator arrangement for her mom , lawyer says
@entity3 's ninth husband must share financial and medical info with daughter
