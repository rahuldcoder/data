-- selling smartphone accessories is all about being in the right place at the right time			1
when outfitting a shiny new mobile device , the vast majority of people pick up a new case and other add - ons the same day they buy the phone , or within the first three months			2
for @entity12 accessory makers , this pairing presents a problem : @entity12 does n't publicly share device measurements ahead of time , so manufacturers have to either wait until a product announcement to start making their products , potentially missing out on sales , or take the more common route of using unofficial leaks and information from factories			1
the new @entity24 goes on sale this friday , just nine days after being announced by @entity12			1
the device is taller and thinner , and sports a brand new port that wo n't fit older charging cords or devices such as speakers			0
iphone 5 pre-order shipping dates pushed back , likely due to demand for consumers upgrading to the new @entity24 , this means spending money to replace the obsolete cases , cords and speakers			2
for accessories makers , it means an opportunity for more sales			2
smartphone accessories are a lucrative business , and @entity24 owners are predictably big on pampering their devices			1
the @entity24 accounts for $ 6 billion of the $ 20.8 billion global smartphone - accessories market that 's forecast for 2012			1
the average smartphone owner spends $ 56 on add - ons per device			0
" there are over a billion handsets shipped every single year , and every single one of them drives accessory purchase , " said @entity50 , senior analyst for mobile devices at @entity52			0
the major players all know the key to getting their products into customers ' hands is already being on the shelves when they buy a new phone			1
for example , 75 % of @entity64 sold will have a case purchased for them at some point			0
of all smartphone cases sold across brands , 38 % are purchased at the same time as the phone , and 36 % are purchased in the first three months , according to @entity52			1
a select number of companies are lucky enough to be on the inside , privy to details directly from @entity12 before a major product announcement			1
they are briefed on specifications -- likely after signing hundreds of pages of non-disclosure agreements -- so they can start production on new compatible accessories in advance			2
@entity12 even has a special program called " @entity89 " for designers and manufacturers making accessories that use licensed components			1
they sometimes get access to specs in advance and can label their products as @entity12 approved			1
for this release , @entity12 teamed up with speaker company @entity95 , among other third - party manufacturers			2
other accessories makers have to either wait or turn to back - channels			2
leaks have suggested that factories in @entity101 that specialize in making @entity24 and @entity103 accessories have dependable specs and mock - ups of the final @entity12 products months in advance			1
hands on with the new @entity24 these factories will create cad files ( a digital technical drawing ) or detailed plastic molds of unannounced products , complete with cut outs and details where the buttons and ports are located			1
designers can use these tools to create new products			0
companies use this information to varying degrees in order to be prepared for a product launch			0
while the reliability of the leaks has increased since the first @entity24 came out in 2007 , they are not guaranteed , and some companies remain nervous about taking a chance on unofficial information			1
" that 's not the way that we operate , " said @entity132 , ceo of @entity133 , a @entity134 - based maker of @entity12 - related accessories			1
" we 'll get product when it hits the store , we 'll be in line with everyone else			0
" @entity133 did n't start production on new cases until immediately after @entity12 's announcement , @entity132 said			0
however , the company did use information , such as the leaked phone specs in the tech press , to prepare as much as possible in advance so that cases would be in stores quickly			1
the company designed new cases for the taller shape , and even produced and photographed physical prototypes the month before @entity12 's event			0
for the @entity24 , an advance team was sent to the factories in @entity160 , standing by to start production , and the entire company hopped on a @entity164 call to follow @entity12 's announcement live september 12			1
by that afternoon , a press release was sent out announcing the company 's new @entity24 cases			0
it hopes to have products ready in three to four weeks			0
" soft goods " like cases are easier to turn around , and the companies have had a lot of practice over the years			0
but for hardware makers , the new port was a challenge			0
@entity179 makes popular @entity24 and @entity103 accessories such as clock radios and speakers			1
the company would n't say if it had any official information ahead of the @entity24 announcement ( on its site it says its products are @entity89 - compliant ) , but did acknowledge that it has been busy			1
" when we anticipate a major product change , even months before an announcement is made , we brainstorm various options and even begin to expedite basic engineering modifications , " @entity188 , ceo of @entity179 , said in an e-mail			0
the company usually takes 7 to 9 months to ship new products , but says this advance work shaves two to three months off that cycle			1
@entity179 plans to start selling new products in early 2013			0
factories do n't wait to snag a customer to start producing products , either			0
they will pre-design and even start production on accessories before @entity12 goes public with a new device			2
then , they 'll try to shop those goods around to big box retailers like @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 , as well as to individual brands that will buy up inventory and then add their own logo			0
@entity12 's secrets are n't so secret anymore , and that 's @entity217 over the years , rumors and leaks about unreleased @entity12 products have become more common			1
@entity12 devices are created by a porous network of third - party factories and employees that even the strongest of non-disclosure agreements ca n't always completely control			2
snippets of information travel between factories or even units of the same company			0
most factories are n't in a monogamous relationship with @entity12 or the approved third - party vendors with access to advance specs , and may also make products for other companies			1
while @entity241 factories have received the most attention ( largely for labor issues ) , that 's just one in a large network of suppliers @entity12 uses			2
in its 2011 list of @entity12 suppliers , @entity12 named 97 companies it contracts to create raw materials and manufacture and assemble products			1
many of those companies only handle one small detail , like providing the nuts and bolts that are used in @entity64			0
others produce more accessories specifically for @entity12 , like @entity261 did on the @entity103 's @entity262			2
navigating the world of factories and rumors is essential to companies competing for those early accessory dollars			2
but even if it is n't ready by friday 's launch date and the surge of new iphone 5 purchases , they are n't out of the game			0
they still have the global roll out of devices to look forward to , and the process could begin again if @entity12 releases the rumored smaller @entity103 this fall			0
new @entity277 sync with @entity64 , @entity278 via @entity279			0

most smartphone accessories are bought in the first three months of owning a phone
for @entity24 accessory makers , the race is on to get products on shelves quickly
some companies get specs from @entity12 in advance , others from leaks and factories
