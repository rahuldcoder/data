-- the image of @entity3 's body hanging from a tree -- noose around his neck , hands tied behind his back , feet barely touching the ground -- is uncomfortable to look at			1
and @entity9 , director of " 12 years a slave , " does not spare the audience with an expedient exit			1
there is no overbearing soundtrack to drown out the sound of him gasping for air			0
for what feels like an eternity , @entity9 makes us watch			0
he makes us know the truth about slavery in a way no @entity25 film in recent memory has			0
the beatings are not brief			0
there are no scenes of white heroes racing against time to save him or undo the injustice that is being done			0
as he hangs there , we hear the birds singing			0
we see the sun fading			0
we feel the fear coursing through the body of a slave who risks her own life just to bring him a sip of water			0
the film shows unflinching moments that shed an unflattering light on something our culture prefers to gloss over , perhaps as a way of healing			2
just like calling people who point out racial inequality " race baiters " is supposedly an effective way to move on			2
oh , we 're willing to talk about slavery			0
but we like the stories told like " @entity59 " : inspirational , with redeemable characters and very few scenes of actual slavery because , well , that 's a downer			2
because of this , @entity9 's @entity65 nomination for best director is welcomed , @entity69 's performance as @entity70 worthy of praise and the best picture nomination for " 12 years " deserving			1
and yet , in one important way , something is missing			0
for if the @entity65 were held today and " 12 years " won best picture -- as some favor it to do -- it would be one of the lowest - grossing winners of the award ever			1
with proceeds just a hair under $ 40 million since its october release , it would join " the @entity85 , " " @entity86 , " " @entity87 " and " @entity88 " as the only best picture winners not to crack the top five at the box office			2
to put this in perspective , the latest @entity92 in drag movie made more in less than a month			2
there is a chance that could change , because historically , there is a surge in interest in movies that are @entity65 darlings			1
even " the @entity85 " -- the lowest - grossing best picture winner to date -- enjoyed an 11.9 % increase in box office receipts after @entity65 nominations were announced			1
when the film won best picture , it jumped 13.6 % from the week prior to the win			2
perhaps in anticipation of a similar increase in demand -- and on the heels of a best drama win at the @entity117 -- @entity118 is reportedly planning to bring the movie to 500 more theaters this upcoming weekend , with the goal of raising the total to 1,000 in the next two weeks			2
before the @entity117 , " 12 years " was in only 114 theaters			1
the film will be in position to make more money			0
the question is : who will go see it ? because word on the street is that " 12 years " is an unapologetic portrayal of our ugly past , and @entity135 prefer our history with some nips and tucks			1
even now , as we are about to celebrate the birthday of the rev. @entity140 , we prefer to talk about the impact of his dream while limiting the mention of the nightmares that gave birth to that dream			0
how many of us will pay to see the scathing truth when refuge in fantasies are far more comforting ? how many of us are ready for a film whose narrative is not dominated by white protagonists but rather a free black man who , in 1841 , was kidnapped , tortured and sold ? to see " 12 years " is to find out that " nigga " as a term of endearment is a misguided delusion			1
to see " 12 years " is to see the full story of what those who fought under the shadow of the @entity164 flag gave their lives to keep			1
to see " 12 years " is to see that the claim that the black people who picked cotton in the field with the star of " @entity172 " were " happy " is a racist insult			1
the movie is an unsanitized portrait of a nation 's shameful past			1
it is two hours of breathing in the @entity179 and then walking out of the theater trying to pretend the stench is all gone			0
there is no question that " @entity185 " was the best picture of 2013			1
but as the box office receipts show , not many of us are ready for that kind of honesty			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

@entity192 : " @entity185 " deserves praises for its unflinching portrayal
@entity192 : even though it 's a *contender* for @entity65 , it has *n't* *attracted* many *viewers*
he says many people may not be ready to see a movie about our ugly past
@entity192 : " 12 years " deserves best picture for sure , but who will see it ?
