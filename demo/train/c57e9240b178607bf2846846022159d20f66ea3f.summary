-- the way we watch tv is changing			1
people want to decide when , where and on what screen they watch their favorite shows			2
one of the simplest tools for viewing your shows from any device is the @entity12 , which is releasing two new models of its popular tv - streaming tool			1
the @entity12 is a device that streams content from cable and satellite providers to mobile devices and computer , allowing you to watch whatever is playing on your tv or recorded on your dvr far from your home			1
instead of having to plant yourself in front of the living room television to watch a new episode of " @entity33 , " you can watch a live or @entity35 stream of it from another room , state or country using a smartphone , tablet or computer			1
the two new @entity12 models add in some key features that were absent from the previous model , the @entity46			1
the smaller $ 180 @entity12 can stream videos up to 1080p and has simplified the set - up process			1
the $ 300 slingbox 500 also streams1080p hd content and has a variety of connection options , including @entity52 , component and composite for linking to your other devices and television set			1
the 500 adds a rough first go of a promising new feature called @entity59 which makes it possible to stream content , such as photos , from your mobile devices or computers back to the tv			1
the old trapezoid design has been overhauled			0
the @entity12 is a small and light box covered in pattern of small diamond shapes			2
the larger @entity69 has a slick undulating rectangle body , that while pretty to look at , makes it difficult to stack other boxes on top of it			0
for the many people playing device @entity77 in their entertainment centers , that means the 500 will always have to be perched on top of the @entity83 , @entity35 , dvd player or @entity84			1
the company is also updating the companion software , @entity87 , and temporarily dropping its price from $ 30 to $ 15 for @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity92 apps			2
the @entity12 and 500 go on sale this sunday			1
the announcement is n't a complete surprise			0
the devices were spotted earlier this month on the shelves of a @entity98 by @entity99			2
and it 's been four years since the last @entity12 hardware release ; that 's eons in gadget years			1
in that time , @entity12 was bought by satellite company @entity104			1
@entity12 is a makeshift solution to cable 's slow move onto the @entity108 and mobile devices			1
there are a host of business reasons these companies do n't stream all their content on demand to any device with an internet connection			2
for example , content is still expensive to produce and advertisers pay less for online placement than they do for television airtime			0
it 's estimated that by the end of 2012 , 3.58 million people in the @entity125 will have opted out of cable for alternative services such as @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 according to the @entity132			2
these consumers , called cord cutters , will only account for 3.6 % of subscribers			0
not enough to leave behind a profitable - but - aging business model just yet			0
cord cutters cobble together an alternative to cable using a combination of services and sometimes illegal streaming sites			0
it can be hard work that requires time and a larger amount of technical know - how than many cable subscribers are likely to have			0
many shows are available for streaming , but the market is heavily fragmented			0
some shows are available for free online but delayed , others through subscription services			0
you can buy episodes through stores like @entity158 or download official apps for the channels you like			0
some of the solutions only work if you have cable , like the @entity164 app that requires you also have a cable subscription			0
the @entity12 is a pat solution for people willing to pay for cable or satellite subscriptions , who want to watch shows on other devices ( a trend called " place shifting " )			1
it does have its limitations			0
only one person can control the tv at a time , so if you 're trying to stream " @entity187 " from a hotel in @entity181 while your husband and kids are watching " @entity186 " at home in @entity185 , their channel will change			0
however , it is still one of the better options in a market of imperfect solutions			0
until cable companies and content creators embrace @entity197 television , tools like @entity12 are a necessary stopgap for a lot of people .			2

@entity12 lets you watch what 's playing on your tv from a mobile device or computer
the two new slingbox devices are the first from the company in four years
both add @entity213 streaming and the @entity12 500 adds @entity52 and @entity214
