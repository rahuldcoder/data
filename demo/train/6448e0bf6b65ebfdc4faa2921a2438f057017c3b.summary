a pro-al @entity0 responsible for a previous armed assault on the @entity3 @entity2 in @entity4 is the chief suspect in tuesday 's attack that killed the @entity3 ambassador to @entity8 , sources tracking militant @entity11 groups in eastern @entity8 say			1
they also note that the attack immediately followed a call from @entity16 leader @entity15 for revenge for the death in june of @entity19 , a senior @entity8 member of the terror group			1
the group suspected to be behind the assault -- the imprisoned @entity23 -- first surfaced in may when it claimed responsibility for an attack on the @entity28 office in @entity4			1
the following month the group claimed responsibility for detonating an explosive device outside the @entity3 consulate and later released a video of that attack			1
@entity34 , once a leading member of the @entity36 and now based at the @entity37 in @entity38 told @entity39 , " an attack like this would likely have required preparation			2
this would not seem to be merely a protest which escalated			0
" slain ambassador died ' trying to help build a better @entity8 ' " according to our sources , the attack was the work of roughly 20 militants , prepared for a military assault ; it is rare that an @entity53 is present at a peaceful protest , " @entity34 said			2
" according to our sources , the attack against the consulate had two waves			1
the first attack led to @entity3 officials being evacuated from the consulate by @entity8 security forces , only for the second wave to be launched against @entity3 officials after they were kept in a secure location			1
" that analysis is supported by @entity3 sources who say the attack on the consulate is believed to have been pre-planned			1
the sources say the attackers used the protest as a diversion to launch the attack , although the sources could not say if the attackers instigated the protest or merely took advantage of it			2
the sources do not believe the ambassador was directly targeted			0
@entity8 deputy interior minister @entity79 , speaking at a news conference in @entity4 on wednesday , said that " among the protesters , there were some who infiltrated the march to start chaos			0
" six things to know about the attack @entity34 , who had earlier warned of the likelihood of renewed attacks against @entity3 interest in @entity8 , said the @entity23 is a prime suspect in the @entity4 attack tuesday			2
he believes it is likely the deadly attack was also linked to a video statement released by @entity15 on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks			2
in the video , @entity15 confirmed the death of @entity19 -- a prominent member of the @entity16 - linked group -- adding : " his blood is calling , urging and inciting you to fight and kill the crusaders			1
" the video released by the @entity104 in june showed nighttime explosions around the consulate , interlaced with footage of @entity108 and @entity15 , along with images from the 9/11 attacks			1
at the time the @entity104 claimed it had launched the attack in response to the first reports of @entity19 's death in a drone strike in the tribal areas of @entity116			1
notably , the @entity104 said the june 5 attack was also timed to coincide with preparations for the arrival of a senior @entity121 official			1
" the time frame of attacks shows that the group has been following and actively involved in gathering information about the activities of diplomatic missions in the country , " @entity34 wrote in a june briefing paper on the group			1
he adds that it appears the @entity23 was also responsible for a rocket attack against the convoy of the @entity135 ambassador in @entity4 on june 11 and an attack against the @entity28 in @entity137 on june 12			1
@entity8 and @entity139 security officials tell @entity39 that @entity16 has taken advantage of a security vacuum to build up a presence in eastern @entity8			1
a senior @entity8 official told @entity39 in june that the @entity3 had flown surveillance missions with drones over suspected jihadist training camps in eastern @entity8			2
the official said that , to the best of his knowledge , they had not been used to fire missiles at militant training camps in the area			0
@entity155 's killing shines light on @entity158 sensitivities around @entity159 another @entity8 official told @entity39 at the same time that five radical @entity11 militant commanders were operating in the @entity163 area , with 200 to 300 men under their command in camps in the area			0
ironically , @entity168 -- the @entity3 ambassador killed in tuesday 's attack -- had written extensively about the rise of @entity172 factions in and around @entity163 in a 2008 diplomatic cable			1
as @entity39 has previously reported , one of militant commanders , according to several sources , is @entity177 , a long - time associate of @entity15			0
@entity177 was dispatched by @entity15 to @entity8 from @entity116 's tribal areas in the spring of 2011 to create a foothold for @entity16 in @entity8 , the sources say			1
@entity177 is a veteran jihadist who fought the @entity182 - backed government in @entity183 in the early 1990s , according to several sources			0
he later moved to the @entity135 , where he increasingly came on the radar screen of @entity135 security services for his radical recruitment efforts in @entity188			0
in the period after the july 2005 @entity38 bombings , he was detained in the @entity192 high - security prison and placed under a control order , according to the sources			0
he left the @entity135 in 2009 and traveled to the tribal areas of @entity116 , according to the sources			0
according to one source , @entity177 has dispatched men as far west as @entity199 and @entity200 in his attempt to build up @entity16 operations in eastern @entity8			1
according to @entity8 security sources , within the militant ranks in @entity163 there are 20 to 30 hardcore jihadist fighters who are cause for most concern			0
one source said a number of @entity211 jihadists are also present in the @entity163 area , as well as fighters belonging to @entity16 's @entity215 affiliate , @entity214			1
another militant whose activities have caused concern in eastern @entity8 is @entity219 , a released @entity220 detainee who is believed to be operating a camp in a remote area outside @entity163			0
his detainee assessment at the prison camp described him as having a " long - term association with @entity226 and members of @entity16 and other extremist groups			1
" @entity8 officials confirmed his presence in the area to @entity39 in june			0
@entity232 : @entity8 has been suffering ' fragile security ' @entity8 security services have so far not moved against the militants , casting doubt over their ability to bring security to the country			0
many areas are still dominated by brigades that fought to topple @entity8 strongman @entity242 and bands of heavily armed young men who have turned to criminality			0
@entity163 has for years been a recruiting ground for @entity16			2
in his 2008 cable , @entity168 described the area as " a wellspring of @entity8 foreign fighters " for @entity16 in @entity251 , and outlined how high youth unemployment , discrimination by the @entity242 regime and the influence of veteran @entity8 jihadists from @entity183 all played a role in radicalizing a new generation			2
in recent months , hardline @entity172 have increasingly asserted themselves in eastern @entity8			0
in june hundreds of fighters wielding @entity261 and black @entity11 banners converged on @entity4 to call for the imposition of sharia law			2
this spring @entity15 's associate @entity177 was confident enough to address a large gathering in the town square of @entity163 , an online video of which has been seen by @entity39			0
@entity168 warned in ' 08 about extremists near @entity4 collectively , some of the @entity172 and jihadist elements in eastern @entity8 began to become known as @entity272 , or " partisans of @entity274			0
" according to reports , eyewitnesses have claimed @entity272 was responsible for organizing the demonstration outside the @entity3 consulate			2
but @entity34 told @entity279 is not really a grouping at all but rather a term applied to an amorphous coalition of @entity11 and @entity172 groups in eastern @entity8 with no leadership structure			0
despite concerns over the growing audacity of salafist - jihadist groups , the victory of secular parties in elections in july had created a measure of optimism about @entity8 's future			0
@entity34 tells @entity39 the reality is that a large majority of @entity8 , including the majority of @entity297 , are opposed to @entity16 's ideology of global jihad			1
he predicts a backlash against the perpetrators of the attack			0
" people will curse them for this , " he told @entity39			0
