-- " i hope you have n't made a mistake , " @entity0 told the cardinals at his celebratory dinner after he was chosen to lead the @entity4			1
he then urged the assembled hierarchy to nourish their bodies , and said with a grin , " may @entity11 forgive you for what you 've done			0
" it brought down the house			0
pope @entity0 has already brought surprising changes			1
he broke with tradition by asking the crowd in @entity18 to pray for him , and then bowed to receive it			0
this struck at least one young @entity4 male , interviewed for the tv cameras , as " the most humble thing i 've ever seen a pope do			2
" pope @entity0 refused to mount the platform previous popes stood on to receive the cardinals , one by one			1
" i 'll stay down here , " he told @entity29 staff			2
he shocked many cardinals by choosing the name " @entity0 , " after @entity33 , a young man born to wealth , but who lived his life in rags , sitting with lepers and the poor outside the @entity41			1
@entity33 is the patron saint of animals as well as the poor			2
he is often depicted in art with birds on his shoulder or held in his hands			0
some saw it as a sign when a seagull landed on top of the chimney that vents the smoke from burning ballots			0
what the press began to call " the @entity59 " sat for 40 minutes on the tin top over the smokestack			0
it then flew off , but shortly a gull landed again in the same place			0
the next smoke was white , for @entity0			1
opinion : pope @entity0 is no herald of big changes judging from the cardinals i saw interviewed , the new pope is widely considered to be a centrist			1
he is socially conservative , opposing same - gender marriage , free condoms and abortion , yet he is also known for his care for @entity78 patients , washing and kissing their feet , and for baptizing the babies of unwed mothers who other clerics had turned down			1
he brings a number of " firsts			0
" he is the first modern @entity87 pope			2
he is the first pope from @entity89 ( his father was an @entity91 immigrant ) a continent that has 39 % of the world 's @entity4			2
he is the first pope who is a @entity95 , a @entity4 order that focuses on teaching youth and social justice			2
but while reporters focus on these firsts , there are other reasons that help explain why the cardinals , in @entity0 ' words , went " to the end of the @entity109 " to find the man to lead the @entity4 world , with its 1.2 billion members			1
opinion : @entity0 , open up the church four reasons repeatedly came up in interviews with @entity4 clerics : they felt it was time to shift the church 's geographic center , they like his pastoral centrism , they believe emphasis on ministering to the poor has been missing and they hold a strong conviction that @entity0 is the man to reform and rebuild a church that has been beset by scandals			1
that phrase , " rebuilding the church " was mentioned by him , according to reports of the pope 's first homily			1
the phrase also comes from the story of @entity33 , who began his ministry by hearing a call to " rebuild my church			0
" pope @entity0 put his emphasis on the spirituality of the church as being first , lest the church be seen as little more than " a compassionate ngo " ( non-governmental organization )			1
@entity142 : @entity0 pick a signal to @entity145 catholics as a practicing @entity4 , my personal , fervent hope is that @entity0 will revive an interest and compassion for the poor			1
" we live in the most unequal part of the world , which has grown the most yet reduced misery the least , " @entity0 said in 2007			1
" the unjust distribution of goods persists , " he said , " creating a situation of social sin that cries out to heaven and limits the possibilities of a fuller life for so many of our brothers			0
" there are indications some cardinals hope this pope will be @entity168 - friendly to @entity169 and the developing world			0
cardinal @entity171 , the archbishop of @entity172 , heads a foundation to promote @entity175 - @entity168 understanding , and looks after @entity176 's only @entity4 as if it were in his diocese			0
@entity178 , a muslim and head of the @entity181 , told the @entity182 , " we believe this is a new chapter in the history of relations between @entity175 and @entity4			0
" i noticed that many cardinals remarked with wonder over the news that @entity0 , while he was in @entity190 , lived in an austere apartment , cooked his own food and took the trolley and subway by himself			1
that this is a matter of wonder to some who live in stone mansions and have chauffeured cars and chefs is a strong indication change has already arrivedâ € ” brought by example			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			2

@entity205 : pope @entity0 has already shown *humility* since being named
she says he can be seen as centrist : socially conservative , but champion for poor , *afflicted*
she says among reasons he was chosen was belief he can reform church after scandals
@entity205 hopes he 'll focus on *inequality* , set example of compassion
