@entity0 -- a @entity3 - affiliated website published on sunday what it claimed was a leaked document containing confidential government security plans for a vital meeting of tribal elders in @entity0 next week , one that is set to discuss @entity12 's long - term relationship with the @entity13 and possible peace talks with the insurgency			1
the plans included a detailed satellite map of the area and purported details of the security arrangements , but the @entity21 immediately dismissed them as fake			1
the tribal elder meeting -- or loya jirga -- is considered by many an important step in harnessing @entity12 consent to both a long - term @entity13 military presence in @entity12 and any possible peace deal with elements of the insurgency			1
it is due to begin wednesday and continue for several days ; hundreds of community leaders have been invited from across the country			0
their conclusions will likely influence @entity12 president @entity36			2
the @entity3 have long threatened to disrupt the event			2
sunday 's alleged leak was interpreted in @entity0 as anything from a desperate insurgency resorting to fraudulent propaganda to a new sign of the @entity3 's enhanced ability to elicit confidential information from government ministries			1
regardless , they are a sign of the information war between coalition forces and the insurgency , both of which regularly trade blows and accusations on social media			0
a translated statement on the website read : " the vigilant @entity57 have acquired the security plans , maps and other documents related to the upcoming supposed loya jirga ( @entity62 assembly ) by means of its personnel embedded inside the enemy ranks			1
" the @entity68 dismissed the post , saying it only served as part of a failing propaganda campaign aimed at intimidating people from attending the loya jirga			1
" this is yet another huge lie by the @entity3 , " said @entity68 spokesman @entity75			2
" it is part of a propaganda campaign and it is what we can expect			0
the @entity3 are under pressure -- they have tried to disrupt and have failed to do so			2
that is why they are resorting to this propaganda			0
" he rejected the notion of jirga delegates due avoiding the meeting because of the alleged leak			0
the document said the following could be " probable threats " posed by the @entity3 : -- " suicide attacks with new and dangerous tactics in one or several places continuing for several hours " ; -- " rocket attacks from @entity0 sub-districts or districts outside " ; -- " infiltration of enemy into the lines of security forces			2
" the statement on the website also said , " these important secrets which you will see in the below pages have been acquired by @entity57 from two ministries and from the special security corps of the government			0
our upcoming attacks will become even more lethal and precise with the acquisition of such intelligence material , if @entity114 wills it			0
" the statement went on to promise further details : " note -- the original security plans which consist of 28 pages and six pictorial maps have been recomposed and rewritten by us for intelligence and policy purposes			1
we will release the second , third , 28th sides of the plan and a map to show its validation and will also release the pictorial part of it in the near future , if @entity131 it			0
" @entity134 's @entity133 was aware of the message on the website , but could not confirm the accuracy of it , spokesman lt. col. @entity132 said			0
" the @entity3 have said they would go to all extremes to disrupt the loya jirga , " he said .			1

the @entity3 says it has detailed security plans of upcoming meeting with tribal elders
the government has dismissed the @entity3 's claims
the meeting , known as the loya jirga , is considered significant
@entity12 's relationship with the @entity13 and peace talks are among the *topics* to be discussed
