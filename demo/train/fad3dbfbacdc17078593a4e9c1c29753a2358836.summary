-- this might sound a bit nutty , but @entity4 researchers are using robot squirrels to learn more about how real ones interact with their main predator , rattlesnakes			1
the lifelike robot , built by a team from the @entity11 , can replicate two behaviors squirrels display when confronted by a rattlesnake			1
research by the @entity15 , professor of psychology at @entity11 , observed that rather than scamper off squirrels would approach a snake " head - first in an elongated posture , making flagging movements with their tails			2
" he also discovered their tails heat up , which is picked up by a snake 's infrared sensor			0
but in the wild there is no way to separate the " heat " and the " flagging , " say researchers			1
and that 's where the robot comes in			2
out in the field near @entity38 , researchers set up " robosquirrel " and a video camera near a foraging snake before retreating out of sight			0
the snakes observed appear to accept the robot as real , with one snake even biting the robot 's head , according to researchers			1
this does n't happen often in the wild says @entity52 , because squirrels possess a " remarkable ability " to dodge a snake attack			0
" snakes will rarely strike a flagging adult squirrel , and if they do they almost always miss , " said @entity52 , assistant professor of biology at @entity57			0
it 's still not clear why squirrels approach such a deadly predator , but @entity52 says they maybe trying to assess the nature of the threat			0
in some cases snakes will leave the area after an encounter			0
" @entity76 " joins a growing list of robot creatures created by @entity11 which include a robot lizard -- used to study display behavior in anole lizards in the @entity75 jungle			1
another saw the use of a robot sage grouse hen to study their real - life mating habits .			2

researchers in @entity83 create robot squirrel to study behavior of rattlesnakes
" @entity76 " replicates two key behaviors observed in the wild when confronted by the predator
