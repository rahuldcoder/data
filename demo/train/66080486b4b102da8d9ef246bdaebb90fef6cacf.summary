-- how 's the broadband access in your community -- or perhaps in other places where you 'd like to live , work or send your kids to school ? now you can look that information up via an interactive @entity9 , unveiled february 17 by the @entity10 and the @entity11			2
it 's one way to understand the current state of the digital divide			0
broadband internet access is one of the main tools for businesses and people to get ahead or , increasingly , to access many basic services			1
but not all @entity21 have broadband access			1
in fact , a new telecommunications administration report , @entity24 2010 , says that about one - third of @entity21 households still lack a broadband internet connection			2
furthermore , 5 % to 10 % of @entity21 only have access to internet services that are too slow to even support a basic set of online functions , such as downloading web pages , photos or video			1
mobile broadband is a huge part of the future of internet access , which is why the @entity40 administration is pushing for its @entity41 , which would expand wireless broadband networks to cover where 98 % of @entity21 live			1
however , ubiquitous availability is not the same thing as equitable access , and lax federal net neutrality requirements for wireless carriers might especially hinder the internet experience for cost - conscious mobile users			2
according to the telecommunications administration , 36 % of @entity21 " have access to wireless internet service at maximum advertised download speeds of 6 mbps or greater , which some consider the minimum speed associated with ' @entity58 ' wireless broadband service			1
" the catch is that often mobile users never actually see those maximum advertised speeds , as @entity61 reported last year			1
most users who run network speed tests on their phones ( something you can do with most smartphones and some other phones ) , typically see considerably lower actual speeds much of the time			0
the @entity9 is based on data " collected from broadband providers or other data sources , " so it may be interesting to compare this map with the crowdsourced cell coverage maps i wrote about earlier this week			2
those are based on data about signal strength and network speed collected from mobile users ' phones running apps such as @entity84 or @entity85			0
the vast majority -- 95 % -- of @entity21 live in places that at least have access to 3g - speed wireless networks , with advertised minimum speeds of at least 768 kbps			1
but increasingly , that 's not enough to really be considered " wireless broadband			0
" the @entity9 , says the telecommunications administration , " includes more than 25 million searchable records showing where broadband internet service is available , the technology used to provide the service , the maximum advertised speeds of the service and the names of the service providers			1
users can search by address to find the broadband providers and services available in the corresponding census block or road segment , view the data on a map or use other interactive tools to compare broadband across various geographies , such as states , counties or congressional districts			0
" it might also be interesting to consider the implications of local demographics , which can easily be explored via the @entity121 ' interactive map of @entity123 data			0
in some cases , there are interesting correlations between the broadband options available in an area and the race , income or education level of the people who live there			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity136 .			0

5 % to 10 % in @entity21 have access to internet too slow to support basic functions
the federal government offers an online map for tracking where fast internet is available
mobile broadband sometimes does not reach advertised speeds
