" however , he said , it also would be possible for @entity5 to plant false information			0
" they would love to sort of create fear when they 're not actually capable of creating a strike			0
... i 've seen it myself , in @entity101			0
you get the @entity103 out there on the ground , and they 're very capable of knowing that the troops are listening to them , and feeding and sowing false information trails saying , ' we 're over on this part of the hill ' when they 're nowhere near it			0
