-- it is a tragic irony that two countries in @entity3 -- @entity4 and @entity5 -- that for many years experienced the subjugation of colonial rule have recently enshrined into law discriminatory practices that dehumanize their own citizens			1
in @entity5 , a draconian bill recently signed by president @entity13 makes it a crime to be gay			1
any person convicted of " the offense of homosexuality " faces life imprisonment			0
anyone found guilty of " funding or sponsoring homosexuality or other related activities " will be sentenced to a seven - year jail term			0
apart from being a flagrant abuse of human rights , the new law will severely impede the efforts of any organization conducting @entity30 prevention and outreach programs serving gay men in @entity5			1
gay men , other men who have sex with men , and transgender individuals are disproportionately affected by @entity38 -- in @entity5 and the world over			1
driving a community that is already stigmatized further into the shadows will seriously undermine progress on the global epidemic , progress that depends on reaching the most vulnerable populations			0
@entity45 from the @entity46 and other nations is greeted by @entity5 's leaders with a familiar refrain : stop trying to impose your values on us			1
but the @entity46 is as entitled as any nation to espouse a set of values , and if those values enshrine the right of all people to be treated with dignity and respect , then we should make every effort to export them			0
the struggle against hiv / aids , now in its fourth decade , has always also been a human rights issue			2
in the early days of @entity38 in the @entity46 , when confusion , ignorance and hysteria reigned , there were those who called for people with @entity30 to be quarantined or tattooed			2
until recently , hiv - positive people were barred from entering the @entity46			0
fighting for its life in the early 1980s , the gay community rose up and the struggle for gay rights became the civil rights struggle of the tail end of the 20th century			0
it is far from over , but with the repeal of " @entity81 , " which sanctioned anti-gay discrimination in the military , and victories on same - sex marriage in 17 @entity46 states and the @entity88 , we have made substantial progress			1
@entity46 attorney general @entity90 has called gay rights one of " the defining civil rights challenges of our time			2
" responding to the passage of the anti-homosexuality law in @entity5 , president @entity95 said it would " complicate " the @entity46 ' relationship with @entity5			1
instead , the passage of this blatantly discriminatory piece of legislation should fundamentally alter our relationship with @entity5 , a country that receives close to $ 500 million annually from the @entity46 in foreign assistance , largely for hiv / aids programs			2
to make its position abundantly clear , the @entity46 should redirect its assistance for @entity38 and other health and development concerns toward nongovernmental and civil society organizations working in @entity5			1
indeed , if protecting the human rights of gay people is in fact a priority of @entity46 foreign policy , then we should re-examine our relationship with all countries receiving foreign aid and restructure our relations with those that criminalize homosexuality			1
as archbishop @entity128 rightly declared in condemning the @entity5 anti-homosexuality law : " there is no scientific justification for prejudice and discrimination , ever			2
and nor is there any moral justification			0
" what does exist , however , is the very real possibility that this cancerous bigotry will spread to other countries wishing to scapegoat an easily targeted minority			0
if they have an ounce of humanity , the governments of @entity5 and @entity4 will repeal these odious laws without delay			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 and @entity146 .			0

@entity145 , @entity146 : @entity5 passed law that makes it a crime to be gay
they say this drives @entity38 vulnerable population into shadows ; undermines @entity38 fight
they say @entity46 has made big progress in human rights crisis of discrimination against gays
