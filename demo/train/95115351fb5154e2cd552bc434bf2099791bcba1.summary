@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 accepted the @entity4 thursday by talking about war and the limits of non-violence			1
but he also praised the peacemakers of the past , and said the world can and should still strive for peace			0
" let us reach for the world that ought to be , " he told the 1,000 - member audience at @entity13			0
" @entity17 - eyed , we can understand that there will be war , and still strive for peace			2
" the @entity23 committee 's choice of @entity3 as this year 's laureate sparked controversy , in part because he is a president waging two wars abroad			1
@entity3 said force is sometimes necessary , but said that is simply " a recognition of history , the imperfections of man , and the limits of reason			2
" read a transcript of @entity3 's acceptance speech " whatever mistakes we have made , the plain fact is this : the @entity42 has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms , " he said			1
" the service of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from @entity55 to @entity56 , and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the @entity60			0
" waging war is not a way of imposing the will of the @entity42 on the world , he said , but a way of seeking a better future for its people			0
" the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace , " he said			1
preserving the peace in @entity0 thursday came with a price -- $ 60 million worth of security preparations			1
@entity1 police said they had more than 2,000 officers on the streets , along with snipers , canine patrols , and helicopters in the air , in the biggest security operation they have ever mounted for a single person			1
@entity85 can be justified on humanitarian grounds , @entity3 said , because inaction can tear at the world 's conscience and lead to more costly intervention later			2
but peace can be justified too , he said , and he outlined three ways to build a just and lasting peace in the world			0
first , @entity3 suggested the world find a better way to deal with nations like @entity98 and @entity56 that break or ignore rules and laws			2
" if we want a lasting peace , then the words of the international community must mean something , " he said			0
" those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable			0
sanctions must exact a real price			0
" what did you think of @entity3 's speech ? there should be consequences for countries that " game the system , " @entity3 said -- and that may sometimes mean engagement			2
but peace , @entity3 said , " is not merely the absence of visible conflict			1
" he said the world needs to seek a just peace based on inherent human rights			0
@entity3 praised pro-democracy leader @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 who voted despite election violence , and pro-democracy protesters in @entity98			1
" it is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any nation , " @entity3 said			2
@entity3 also defended engagement with such repressive regimes , mentioning president @entity140 's trip to @entity141 in the 1970s , pope @entity143 's trip to @entity144 , and president @entity146 's efforts on arms control and talks with the @entity149			1
" there is no simple formula here , " he said			0
" but we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement , pressure and incentives , so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time			0
" his third point was that peace should be based not only on rights , but also on economic security and opportunity			2
" true peace is not just freedom from fear , but freedom from want , " he said			0
development rarely happens without security , and security does not exist in places where people do n't have enough food , water , or medicine , he said , adding that it also does n't exist if people ca n't aspire to decent education or employment			0
" the absence of hope can rot a society from within , " he said			0
another controversial aspect to @entity3 's selection was the question of what he had done to deserve the prize			1
he had been in office for only days when he was nominated , and the prize recognizes his work toward peace for most of 2008 , largely when he was still a presidential candidate			2
some of the protesters outside the awards venue questioned whether @entity3 should have received the @entity23 in the first place , with one sign reading , " @entity3 : you won it			1
now earn it ! " @entity1 prime minister @entity197 , who joined @entity3 at a news conference earlier in the day , said the prize was deserved because @entity3 has provided leadership on key issues facing the world like disarmament , nuclear nonproliferation , and fighting global warming			1
" i can not think about anyone else who has done more for peace during the last year than @entity3 , " @entity197 said			1
" it is a well - deserved peace prize and hopefully it is really in the best spirit of @entity211 , because it can contribute in itself to strengthening the efforts of the president to work for peace			1
" @entity217 , chairman of the nobel prize committee , also said @entity3 deserved the award			1
echoing the title of one of the president 's books , @entity217 said , " @entity3 has the audacity of hope and the tenacity to make these hopes come true			1
" @entity3 , who earlier in the day said he had " no doubt " that others were more deserving of the award , acknowledged those questions early in his acceptance speech			2
" i am at the beginning , and not the end , of my labors on the world stage , " he said			0
" my accomplishments are slight			0
" he said he accepted the prize with " great humility			0

new : protesters demonstrate outside venue ; @entity1 spent $ 60 million on security
" instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace , " @entity3 says
