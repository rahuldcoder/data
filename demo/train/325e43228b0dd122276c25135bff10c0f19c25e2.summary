it 's official -- world football 's controversial leader @entity2 is set to enter the enemy 's lair just weeks after accusing @entity6 of plotting to depose him			1
the @entity9 president is prepared to the risk of public humiliation in @entity12 next month as he faces the three men who plan to usurp him with @entity14 governing body @entity6 considering giving each candidate the chance to make their case at its congress on march 24			1
@entity9 confirmed to @entity1 that @entity2 plans to be in @entity19 for the congress as he steps up his campaigning to retain the presidency			1
with 209 federation votes at stake , the candidates will have the opportunity to influence over a quarter of them as they address @entity6 's 54 member nations at an event that would be broadcast online			2
seeking a fifth consecutive term in office at the age of 79 , @entity2 is facing challenges from @entity35 's @entity34 , @entity37 @entity36 and former @entity38 and @entity40 star @entity39			1
all three of @entity2 's opponents have declared their willingness to take part in a live debate with the @entity45 , who has previously rejected such offers by claiming football should not " imitate politics			2
" that 's a reference to the political debates , for example in the @entity53 and @entity54 , where politicians slug it out in front of the cameras ahead of elections			2
while prince @entity60 has called for an open debate and @entity62 even suggested a @entity64 hangout , @entity6 is examining the possibility of giving each candidate an allotted amount of time to outline their plans to repair @entity9 's battered image			1
the world governing body 's reputation has been dragged through the mud by the furor over alleged corruption surrounding the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity78			2
that criticism reached a fever pitch when the man brought in by @entity9 to investigate , @entity53 lawyer @entity79 , resigned in protest last year , unhappy that his published summary did not accurately reflect his findings			2
while an actual debate is unlikely at this stage , the opportunity for @entity2 's opponents to speak to congress and potentially highlight the incumbent 's failings right in front of him could potentially prove embarrassing to the @entity45			1
speaking at his campaign launch in @entity94 on tuesday , prince @entity60 threw down the gauntlet to @entity2 , suggesting an open debate between candidates should take place			1
" if we are talking about transparency , i would like to see , at least before the elections a public debate , including the incumbent , " prince @entity60 said			1
" if we talk about reform , proper reform , i 'm not confident i 've seen it			0
he 's had the chance to do it , " added prince @entity60 referring to @entity2			1
" we 've also had promises from him that he would not run again			0
he has been the president and , definitely , the president needs to be held responsible for what happens			0
" both prince @entity60 and @entity112 , who failed to gain the required number of backers to qualify for the election , have been scathing over @entity9 's image in recent days			1
in an open letter , @entity112 said that he was unable to collect the five nominations needed as a number of associations feared they would be punished for supporting him			2
" i warmly thank the three federations that have endorsed me and the many presidents who explained , with candor and friendship , that they could not do it despite their interest in my program , " he wrote			0
" the reasons were numerous			0
because they feared reprisals from their confederations having issued ' recommendations			0
' " because their federations were candidates to host continental competitions			0
because they relied too heavily on the financial support			0
because they were committed to defend a united continental front			0
" prince @entity60 has gone as fas as to suggest that @entity9 is run by a " culture of intimidation " with some national associations fearing retribution if they back any other candidate other than @entity2 , though the @entity35 did n't provide specific examples			1
@entity9 declined to comment when contacted by @entity1 over prince @entity60 's " intimidation " reference			1
allegations of corruption have blighted @entity2 's 17 - year reign and @entity154 , president of @entity6 , has been outspoken of his desire to see the @entity45 removed from the top of world football			1
@entity2 is aware of @entity154 's stance and speaking to @entity1 last month , he insisted @entity6 was waging a campaign to depose him			1
they want to get rid of me , " he told @entity1			0
" all this opposition is coming now it 's unfortunate to say it , it 's coming from @entity164 , from @entity6			2
they do n't have the courage to come in			0
" so let me go ( on ) -- be respectful ! because in football you learn to win but you also learn to lose			0
so i 'm going now			0
if i win the better , if i lose ok ! "			0
