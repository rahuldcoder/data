-- most of the world seems to think that @entity4 invented obesity sometime in the last century , but the truth is , fat has always been a part of life ( witness @entity10 , one of the great ancient @entity12 queens who reigned in the 15th century @entity13 -- despite her svelte sarcophagus , modern archeologists believe that she was pretty obese and may have suffered from diabetes )			1
@entity16 may have delivered a dubious dietary aid -- tapeworms			1
so it stands to reason that dieting has been around just as long			0
some historians credit @entity22 with starting the first fad diet			1
having grown too fat to ride his horse , @entity22 went on a liquid diet in 1087 -- or , rather , a liquor diet , since all he did was drink booze			1
the story might be apocryphal -- @entity22 , still fat , actually died after falling from his horse and there was no word on whether he was drunk at the time -- but it 's a good one , and it sets the tone for the next 1000 + years of dieting			1
throughout history , people have been looking for some kind of magic that will allow one to eat and live as one pleases , but still look emaciatedly gorgeous			0
and they 've come up with some pretty dubious theories that somehow took hold in the public consciousness and became fads			1
here are a few of our favorites			0
location , location , location " the causes and @entity57 " was a treatise penned in 1727 by one @entity51 , in which he observed that larger people were more likely to live near swampy areas			2
his advice ? fat people should move to more arid climes			2
improbable side effects the namesake of the graham cracker -- ironically now an integral part of that deliciously fattening treat , the ' smore -- was a @entity67 minister who claimed that overeating could not only make you fat , it could make you lecherous , too			0
in the 1830s , @entity70 ran health retreats for like - minded parishioners featuring a strict meat - free , incredibly bland diet			2
chew yourself thin @entity76 , a turn of the century @entity79 art dealer , became known as the @entity80 after he claimed he lost more than 40 pounds by chewing his food until it was essentially liquefied and spitting out all the bits that were n't			1
@entity76 's scheme became incredibly popular -- novelist @entity84 and industry titan @entity85 were reportedly fans , as was @entity88			0
@entity88 , of the cereal fame , was a health nut who ran a sanitarium in @entity93 , where he encouraged his visitors to " @entity76 " with a little song he wrote called " @entity97			0
" @entity0 : how cereal transformed @entity4 culture the parasite diet in the early part of the 20th century , the weight loss industry allegedly found a tiny little helper in the form of a tiny little parasite -- the noble tapeworm			1
according to product advertisements of the day , tapeworms were being sold in pill form as a weight loss tool			1
while whether or not those pills actually contained a real live tapeworm is certainly debatable , however , there is evidence that jockeys , who frequently needed to lose a lot of weight fast , would try to induce tapeworms			1
another favorite weight loss tool of the lilliputian equestrians : burying themselves in piles of horse manure , which acted as a kind of natural sauna			1
introducing the calorie in 1918 , dr. @entity126 introduced a new word to the world lexicon -- " calorie " ( may she be forever cursed for it )			0
@entity126 ' book , " @entity135 , with a key to @entity137 , " which helpfully included a phonetic spelling of the word " calorie , " as so many people were unfamiliar with it , sold more than 2 million copies and established calorie - counting as the framework of a good health			2
this diet regime was n't particularly dubious , but it did lend a potentially dangerous new tool to those looking for a way to quantify and reduce their food intake			1
case in point : the @entity152 of 1979 , a strict 700 - calorie a day diet that works -- because you 're starving			2
@entity0 : quiz : which item has more calories ? the goldfish diet ok , this one was n't so much about weight loss as it was fame gain , but in 1939 , it was a fad that swept the nation			1
like most good things , it all started with a bet -- a @entity168 undergrad won $ 10 after swallowing an innocent fishy			0
the story spread from there , prompting a countrywide goldfish slaughter			0
goldfish swallowing became so popular that not only were pet stores running out of the indigestible comestibles , but the @entity175 published warnings from doctors that swallowing goldfish , which are known to carry tapeworms and other parasites , could be very harmful to one 's health			2
the nicotine diet by the middle of the 20th century , dieting had become such a major economic , social and cultural force in the western world that cigarette companies , not wanting to miss the money boat , jumped on board promoting cigarettes as a weight - loss tool			1
it 's a belief that persists today -- ask any supermodel			0
the master cleanse in the 1940s , nutrition guru @entity196 created the @entity199 , a fast during which the dieter subsists solely on a mixture of cayenne pepper , fresh - squeezed lemon juice , maple syrup and water			0
the master cleanse is still popular today , especially among anorexics and aspiring anorexics , despite the fact that most nutritionists and doctors say that " detoxing " is a nonsensical and potentially harmful idea			0
the @entity215 diet then there 's the @entity217 , a regime that allows the dieter to literally sleep off the pounds while under heavy sedation for several days			2
@entity220 was reportedly a fan of that one , right about the time when he was having a little trouble squeezing into those trademark white jump suits , as was a character in the landmark beach read , " @entity227			0
" @entity0 : 7 simple rules for how to take a nap the monotony diets the 20th century also brought us back to a concept allegedly pioneered by @entity22 -- the single food or drink diet			1
there 's the @entity236 , which alleges that eating a lot of grapefruit and drinking a lot of grapefruit juice , in conjunction , of course , with a very low - calorie diet , is the way to weigh less ; the @entity245 , which is said to cause serious gas with a side of nausea ; the @entity249 , which is pretty much undercut by all the tasty things one puts on popcorn to make it palatable ; and the @entity253 , which , though tempting , is just plain silliness			2
memorable dieting paraphernalia and let 's not forget about the gadgets that went along with these suspect food fads , like the @entity259 , which made food look unappealing , or the @entity262 system , which encouraged people to eat smaller portions by supplying them with -- you guessed it -- smaller forks			0
or how about slimming soaps , popular in the 1930s , which promised dieters that they could just wash the fat away ? and then there 's the perennially popular vibrating machine , which promised to melt off pounds by a few minutes of intense body vibration -- and which is actually enjoying a comeback now at gadgetry stores like @entity277			0
