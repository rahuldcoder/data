@entity0 -- the @entity3 authorities have contested reports that three @entity5 set themselves on fire last week in a remote area of southwestern @entity3			1
the conflicting accounts followed an increase in security measures by the @entity3 authorities in @entity11 , an ethnically @entity5 area of @entity13 , in response to violent protests that took place last month			1
the unrest has been fueled in part by reports of a string of self - immolations by @entity5 over the past year amid anger and despair over @entity3 rule			1
@entity25 , a @entity26 - based nonprofit group , reported over the weekend that the three @entity5 had set fire to themselves on friday morning in a village known as @entity29 and that one of them had died as a result			1
the group , which broadcasts in @entity34 countries that it says lack " full and free news media , " attributed the information to unidentified sources			0
according to @entity25 , @entity29 is in the county of @entity40 in @entity11 , which is home to a population that is nearly 80 % @entity5			0
@entity42 is known by @entity5 as @entity43			0
@entity44 , a @entity46 - based organization that campaigns against @entity3 rule in the @entity5 region , also reported the self - immolations on its website			1
it did not specify where it got the information from			0

calls by @entity1 to government offices in @entity86 went unanswered monday			0
the violence that has taken place in @entity11 recently appears to be the worst between ethnic @entity5 and the @entity3 authorities since 2008 , when deadly unrest in the @entity5 capital , @entity92 , left at least 22 people dead			2
the @entity3 government 's version of events in the region has regularly differed from those of groups like @entity44 and the @entity100			1
those advocacy groups have reported that the @entity3 authorities have fired on unarmed protesters in at least three places in the past two weeks , killing several and wounding dozens			1
the @entity3 state - run media have reported that at least one protester was killed in the clashes , but that the police fired in self - defense after the @entity5 attacked them			1

tibetans in @entity122 , the capital of @entity13 , told @entity1 that they wished for more freedom and the return of the @entity125 , their spiritual leader who fled to @entity126 during an uprising against @entity3 rule in 1959			0
pro-tibetan groups claim @entity5 have gradually become the minority population in their own homeland , as @entity132 -- @entity3 's main ethnic group -- have migrated to the region			2
