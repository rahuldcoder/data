-- in 2011 , @entity1 surprised the world with a feat that neither @entity4 nor @entity5 could accomplish			1
on august 1 , aged 22 , the @entity6 became the youngest golfer to win five major championships			1
@entity11 , as her friends call her , has two @entity12 , two @entity13 and one @entity15 trophies in a special case set at her @entity18 home , which she bought from her long - time idol @entity19			1
in her first five seasons as an @entity13 member she earned 15 titles , 10 of them between 2011 and 2012			1
her accomplishments took her to the top of the @entity25 and she stayed there until march 2013 , when @entity28 @entity27 ousted her			2
but those achievements must feel some way away with @entity1 going through her least successful season since 2009			1
after leading women 's golf for two years , @entity1 sits 14th in the rankings			1
she has not won a single tournament since march 2012 and , for the first time since she joined the @entity13 , she missed five cuts consecutively			1
" i think when you played that well and you get to a certain level where you are above everybody else you feel you are flying so high , " @entity37 , @entity1 's swing coach since 2010 , told @entity0 " being no. 1 at a young age is very tough and you still have a lot to learn about yourself ; suddenly you win two tournaments and bang you are no. 1 in the world			1
" @entity46 crushes @entity28 to retain @entity47 @entity1 is one of the most committed players on the @entity49			1
she knew that playing her best was not enough and so she perfected her @entity50 to have a better relationship with sponsors , media and fans			0
her life seemed like a dream - come - true , but the truth , according to @entity37 , is that she felt a little bit out of her comfort zone			2
" as she kept on winning it was fine , then she started to struggle a little bit with her game because she felt like ' hey , being no. 1 is not all that is made out to be '			0
" it is like you do n't live your own life , you live the life according to being no. 1 in the world			0
" at last march 's @entity71 , @entity70 was closer than ever to become the best golfer on the planet			1
" it will be a good release for me , " admitted @entity1 when asked about the possibility of being usurped in the rankings			1
five months after her revelation , @entity1 is outside the @entity25 top 10			1
from january to august 2013 , she has earned $ 273,743			0
two years ago , in that same period , she grabbed $ 1.7 million			0
getting back to where she used to be will be a tough task			0
especially since @entity84 has taken the game to a whole new level , having won the first three majors of the season , something only @entity89 had previously accomplished back in 1950			2
" all she has to do is recommit and motivate herself to get to that level , she needs to go back to the things that made her be no. 1 , " said @entity37			0
that includes working in her personality			0
@entity37 describes her as an " outgoing , fun and true to herself " kind of person , but she is an aggressive player			0
so , is this a mental or a technical issue ? " she 's always had an unorthodox golf swing but she has won 22 times , " answered @entity37			2
that means she has more titles than many golfers ever get in a lifetime , and she just needs to grab the @entity104 to complete the career grand slam			2
" she is not scared of competing with anybody and finds new ways to challenge herself , " @entity37 said of his 24 - year - old charge			1
the $ 64 million question is : can she come back ? in 2011 , @entity4 sat 52nd in the men 's rankings , today he once again leads men 's golf			0
" you do n't want to put too much pressure on her , you want to give her time to grow and learn , " continued @entity37			2
" this may be a difficult time for her but i think this is going to cause great growth in her			0
" she has to go out there and be @entity123			0
the more she can be @entity123 the better she is going to be			0
she plays with her heart , she has great determination			0

@entity1 is the youngest golfer in *history* to have won five majors
the @entity6 15 @entity13 titles during her first five seasons on the tour
the 24 - year - old has not won a tournament since march 2012
her swing coach says it is *important* that too much pressure is not put on @entity1
