-- for the first time , @entity1 sent two women to the @entity4 -- @entity5 and @entity6 , who will compete in judo and track and field			1
but their participation is far from a groundbreaking step for @entity1 women			1
it was touch and go whether one of the @entity1 women , @entity5 , would even participate this year when the president of the @entity18 said women wearing headscarves would not be allowed to compete for fear of choking and injury			1
the issue has been resolved and she will participate in a form of headgear that complies with @entity1 's strict @entity28 dress codes for women			2
but if @entity5 had withdrawn , it would not have been a setback for @entity1 women because her inclusion was not a sign of advancement			1
the presence of @entity1 women is the result of several months of pressure by the @entity38 on @entity1 to include women competitors or face being banned from participation			1
the situation for female athletes in @entity1 is bleak			0
@entity1 women in general are denied the right to practice sports			1
@entity1 is the only country in the world that prevents girls from taking part in sports in government schools			1
physical education is allowed only in private schools			2
women are not allowed to play in official sports clubs or even watch matches in stadiums			2
girls ' football , volleyball and basketball games in private schools and colleges are held secretly			2
because of this ban , finding women with @entity4 level training was a kind of mission impossible			0
only a few days before its july announcement that the two women would attend , the @entity69 said it could not find a woman qualified enough to compete			0
most muslim - majority countries have sent female athletes to compete in the @entity4 for decades			0
more @entity76 women are competing in sports today than ever			0
but even when women are included , competition remains a challenge , particularly because of athletic dress codes			0
in 2007 , the @entity82 issued a ban on the hijab or headscarf			0
but this year , @entity82 has lifted the ban after testing new hijabs specifically designed for athletes			0
in sports and in daily life , women have few rights in @entity1			2
the country , according to a @entity94 report , has one of worst records on women 's rights in the world			1
women are treated as legal minors and often must have a man 's permission to leave their homes , seek medical care , participate in public life , study , go to government offices and courts or even make decisions for their children			0
the genders are strictly segregated			0
it would be tempting to see the @entity1 's decision to include women in the @entity4 as a big step forward			1
but as @entity118 , director of global initiatives at @entity94 , said : " an 11th hour change of course to avoid a ban does not alter the dismal and unequal conditions for women and girls in @entity1			1
" the signs of change for @entity1 women are yet to come			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity131 .			0

@entity131 : it 's not an advance that @entity1 sent two women to the @entity4
the country sent them to avoid a ban on participating , she says , but situation is dire at home
@entity131 : @entity1 women and girls can not play or watch sports , except girls in private schools
@entity1 has one of the worst records on women 's rights in the world , she *writes*
