-- @entity2 - winning singer @entity1 joined human rights activists to demand courts martial for troops who publicly gang raped women in the streets of the @entity10 country of @entity11 last month			1
it 's part of a strong message against rape that @entity1 , a @entity20 goodwill ambassador , and activist @entity21 are spreading to the women of @entity13 , the governments of @entity13 and the rest of the world			1
" i refuse any man to stand here and justify rape to me , because every girl , every woman that is raped is their mother , their grandmother that they are raping , their sister and their daughter , " @entity35 singer @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity36 on friday			1
" and we can not sit back -- i ca n't just accept it , and i 'm never going to accept it in my life 's breath			0
" governments , international and regional groups " have failed the women of this world , " said @entity21 , founder and executive director of @entity43 and @entity44			1
" they 've come up with all of these exotic resolutions , but they lack accountability mechanism , and they 're almost like toothless bulldogs , " she said			0
" ... you have what happened in @entity11 few days ago			2
no one is compelling that military government to court martial all of those who raped women publicly in the streets			2
" @entity11 soldiers cracked down on pro-democracy protesters a month ago , leaving more than 150 people dead			2
the @entity65 , the @entity66 , and the @entity67 have all imposed sanctions against @entity11 's military junta			2
on friday , @entity71 @entity70 ban ki - moon announced the three members who would comprise the international commission to investigate the alleged crackdown and rapes			1
separately , in the @entity79 the @entity80 , which tries people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , has said it would look into the deaths and rapes and determine whether they fall under its jurisdiction			0
the @entity11 government under capt. @entity90 , who seized power in a bloodless coup in december , said last month that most of the people who died were crushed in the rally			1
@entity21 , a @entity95 , was the focus of the documentary " @entity103 , " which shows how women confronted then - @entity95 president @entity99 with a demand for peace to end a bloody 14 - year civil war			1
led by @entity21 , @entity95 women locked arms and refused to let @entity99 's representatives out of negotiations in @entity108 until they had reached a peace agreement			1
ultimately , @entity99 resigned from office after a @entity71 tribunal charged him with war crimes			1
he went into hiding for a time but is now on trial			0
the efforts of the @entity95 women ultimately led to the election of @entity118 as @entity13 's first female head of state			1
" i think definitely this can be repeated , " @entity21 said of @entity118 's election			2
" and one of the things that i 'm grateful [ to ] the documentary for is that it emboldens women in every part			0
" ... this documentary is like a landmark or something that tells other women , ' people did it before we came , we 've done it , and they can also do it , ' " she said			0
" so it 's not a fluke			0
people just need to rise up and rise above the politics that so deeply divide us as women			0
" women have power but must learn to use it , said @entity1 , who provided music for the documentary			1
" the thing is , we women of @entity13 , we have the power , " she said			2
" we women of the world , we have the power , but we do n't know the power we have			1
" " ... i 've been thinking about @entity156 and @entity157 for so many years , " she said			0
" who 's paying the highest price for this ? the mothers , crying for their sons dying			0
" @entity1 said she believed that a strong coalition of women could be a deciding factor			1
" we say to both sides , ' enough is enough			0
we are tired of war , as you said			0
we are tired of our children not being safe			0
without peace , our children ca n't go to school , we ca n't have health care			0
" i mean , we women , we have the power			2
we 've got to be absolutely in power			0
" and that begins with communities , @entity21 said			2
" what we need to do and what we 've done -- what we did in @entity95 was going back into the communities and really just reassuring these women that it 's ok to step out with that power , " she said .			1

@entity21 : international groups , governments " have failed the women of this world "
@entity21 led @entity95 women to confront then - president @entity99 to reach peace deal
