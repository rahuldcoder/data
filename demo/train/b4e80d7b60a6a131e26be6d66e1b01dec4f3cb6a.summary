-- an estimated one percent of adults have active epilepsy , and many of them are getting insufficient treatment , according to a 19 - state survey released thursday			1
" this is the first time that we actually have data from multiple states , " said @entity7 , lead author of the @entity9 study , in a telephone interview			2
" what we learned is that , among adults with active epilepsy , more than a third of them reported not seeing a specialist for their epilepsy , and that 's really unacceptable			1
" a follow - up survey is planned to determine why so many people with seizure disorders said they had not seen a specialist in the past year , @entity7 said			2
" this is a highly specialized field , " said @entity29 , the president and ceo of the @entity31 , which collaborated with the authors of the study			2
" it 's not possible to get state - of - the - art care " for the disorder from primary care doctors			0
one in six ( 16.1 percent ) adults with active epilepsy with recent seizures said they were not taking their medication and two - thirds ( 65.1 percent ) said they had had more than one seizure during the prior month			1
more than a fifth ( 20.4 percent ) said cost was a barrier to seeking care from their doctor			0
access to high - quality care is key to quality of life , @entity7 said			0
people with recurrent seizures face substantial impairments in their daily activities ; many are not allowed to drive and , as a result , depend on public transportation			1
in some areas , particularly rural ones , that can present a barrier to full participation in life , she said			0
in addition to carrying stigma , people with epilepsy were more likely to live in households with the lowest annual incomes and to report being unemployed and unable to work			1
according to the 2005 findings , 1.65 percent of the population said they had been told by a doctor that they had epilepsy or a seizure disorder , the report said			2
half of that group ( 0.84 percent ) said they had active epilepsy -- defined as having had one or more seizures during the prior three months or currently taking medication			1
if the findings translate to the general population , that means a stadium filled with 60,000 people would contain 480 people with active epilepsy , @entity7 noted , adding , " epilepsy is not rare			1
" but that view was disputed by dr. @entity97 , a family physician in @entity99 , @entity100 , and president of the @entity102			0
" there are patients that can be managed fairly simply with seizure disorder , " he said in a telephone interview			0
" in my own personal practice , i 'd say that i can manage at least half , if not more , of the patients that have seizure disorder			0
" many of the others are able to get by with just a one - time visit to a neurologist , said @entity97 , whose practice is 50 miles from the nearest neurologist , and 100 miles from the nearest neurologist who accepts @entity118 , the government program for the poor			0
" there 's only a handful of patients that are managed in my area by the neurologist			0
" he said financial barriers -- from insurance to the cost of anti-seizure medication -- are a bigger problem			2
" if you ca n't afford to buy it -- which is what i run into with a lot of the seizure medicine -- it does n't really matter " if patients see a neurologist or a family physician , he said			0
many patients , forced to choose between paying their light bill or taking their anti-seizure medication , choose the former , @entity97 said			2
epilepsy is a condition in which the normal activity of the brain malfunctions , causing recurrent seizures -- electrical storms in the brain -- that can be characterized by a range of symptoms , including sudden change in awareness , movement or sensation			1
each year , about 200,000 people in the @entity157 are diagnosed with the disease , as was @entity160 chief justice @entity159 after he suffered a seizure last year at his @entity163 vacation home			1
" many people with epilepsy do lead normal , productive lives despite the hardship of having this disorder , " @entity7 said			1
the study , conducted by the federal government and published in the @entity9 's @entity171 , estimates that 2.7 million people in the @entity157 have epilepsy , and that it costs some $ 15.5 billion in medical care and lost or reduced earnings or productivity each year			1
@entity29 said the incidence of the disorder is expected to climb among veterans returning from @entity179 or @entity180 , where head injuries are common			0
" when you have a head injury , it 's common for epilepsy to develop after a gestational period -- it could be a couple of months or it could be years , " he said			2
and the aging population is also expected to boost the incidence of epilepsy			0
conditions of aging , such as stroke and @entity194 , are also associated with a higher incidence of epilepsy			0
the study was based on data from more than 120,000 adults in the @entity200 .			1

one in six adults with epilepsy who had recent seizures were not on medication
epilepsy is a condition in which the normal activity of the brain malfunctions
study says about 200,000 people in the @entity157 are diagnosed with the disease
