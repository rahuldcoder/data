-- this fall , for the first time in @entity4 history , an openly atheist candidate is running for @entity5			1
@entity6 is fighting an uphill battle as a @entity8 seeking to represent the very @entity10 5th @entity9 in @entity11			1
there are now no openly atheist members of @entity5 , even though nearly 20 % of @entity4 report having no religious affiliation , according to the @entity15 , and between 5 % and 10 % of @entity4 do not believe in a supreme being			1
so far , only one sitting congressman , @entity17 of @entity18 , has ever admitted to being an atheist while in office			0
first elected in 1972 , @entity17 came out of the atheist closet back in 2007 , but he lost his re-election bid in 2012 after serving in the @entity23 for 40 years			0
photos : famous atheists and their beliefs apparently , it is easier to be a gay member of @entity5 than an atheist one , since @entity30 announced he was gay in 1987 but did n't announce he was an atheist until after leaving office in 2013			1
a handful of current members of @entity5 state that their religious affiliation is " unspecified , " but none has stated publicly that he or she does n't believe in @entity39			1
their reticence is pure political pragmatism			0
the reluctance of @entity4 to vote for atheists is well documented			1
in fact , a hypothetical " well - qualified " atheist presidential candidate polls at 54 % , lower than any other category -- below @entity49 , gays / lesbians , @entity52 , jews , hispanics , @entity55 , women , or african - americans			0
this fundamental distrust is puzzling			0
when people of faith question the morality of those without faith , how do they reconcile that with the countless crimes committed in the name of religion throughout history ( e.g. the @entity68 ) and in modern times ( e.g. @entity70 ) ? not only are atheists unlikely to win elections , but they are actually banned from holding office under the constitutions of seven states ( @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 ) , according to the @entity83 , even though this clearly violates @entity84 of the @entity85 , which states that " no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the @entity4			1
" when the views of anywhere from 5 % to 20 % of the @entity4 people are not part of the debate in our legislatures , the laws that are passed may not fully reflect the will of the people or , at a minimum , take into account the opinion of a sizable minority			1
african - americans are about 13 % of the @entity4 population and have a representation of about 10 % of the members of the @entity23			2
imagine how people would react today if there were no african - americans in @entity5			2
that admitted atheists are virtually unelectable is a mark of prejudice against them and it impacts the ways we formally educate the future leaders of this country			2
consider the fact that @entity81 recently passed a law allowing teachers to tell their students that evolution and climate change are " scientifically controversial , " and that @entity127 is considering passing a law that would enable the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution			0
why is it that we require our candidates to profess a religious faith , but not that they demonstrate even minimal scientific literacy ? our representatives in @entity5 make critical decisions on science policy and science funding , and yet are often hostile to the entire scientific enterprise			2
in 2012 , rep. @entity141 , @entity142 , while serving on the @entity23 science committee , famously said that evolution and the @entity145 are " lies from the pit of hell			0
" as one prejudice after another has fallen by the wayside and we have elected women , african - americans , gays and lesbians , and @entity157 people to represent us , we have seen that the world has not come to an end			0
life continues , and our debate is enriched by the diversity of opinions			0
it is time to end the prejudice that keeps qualified people without faith from considering a run for public office and keeps atheist officials from being honest about their beliefs			1
join us on @entity173 / @entity172 .			0

a @entity8 is running for @entity5 , openly saying he is an atheist
@entity177 : atheists are significant *fraction* of @entity4 , why not elect them ?
the prejudice facing atheists is greater than that faced by other *groups* , he says
@entity177 : prejudice keeps atheists from running and *discourages* candor about beliefs
