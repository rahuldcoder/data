-- @entity1 may have taken some heat for her @entity4 costume , but those who know her say she did n't mean any harm			1

" @entity1 quickly took to @entity18 to apologize once there was backlash			1
on monday night competitors from her former show , " @entity23 , " stepped up to defend her			1
" i know @entity1 personally and none of the critique that she is getting at all relates to her as a person , period , " dancer @entity29 told @entity0			1
" whether it was a smart decision is a different conversation			0
but the intention , and going deep into the conversation of judging her character , of what she may or may not think behind the scenes -- that is absurd			0
" " i know her as a person and she is kind and graceful ... and she has the right mentality			0
i just think it was a stupid mistake			2
" her brother , @entity44 , who also competes on the show , told @entity46 news his sister could n't feel sorrier about the incident			2

" he said he believes @entity1 was just out for some fun and got caught in the media glare			1
" fortunately or unfortunately , in this day and age with 24 - hour coverage and social media and all that , you got to be careful with what you do			0
and ( @entity1 ) would no more make any kind of racist statements than anybody on the earth , " @entity51 said			2
" and so i would say it was probably just an innocent mistake			0
... trust me , i 've had things taken the way i did n't want things			0
