@entity0 -- the morning that the federal government reopened after 16 days of political stalemate , president @entity2 stood at the podium in the @entity6 of the @entity7			1
" those of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job as best we can			2
we come from different parties , but we are @entity15 first , " he said			2
he then chastised @entity17 lawmakers , blaming them for the shutdown and drama over the debt ceiling that he called " completely unnecessary " and said damaged " our economy			2
" fresh from what most are calling an undisputed political victory over the conservatives , the president did n't seem in a conciliatory mood			1
his body language said it all : enough already			2
a long history , a strained relationship @entity2 has more than three years left in his presidency and the next battle is just months away because the deal approved by @entity34 that he signed only funds the government through early january and only extends @entity15 borrowing authority until early february			1
from his bully pulpit on thursday , @entity2 invoked his professorial tone and implored @entity34 that their working relationship " has to change			1
" " because we 've all got a lot of work to do on behalf of the @entity15 people and that includes the hard work of regaining their trust , " @entity2 said			1
this episode was only the latest in a series of confrontations between the president and @entity34			1
to say that his relationship with the legislative branch has been strained might be the political understatement of the decade			2
a deal for now , but this year 's been a legislative dud for @entity2 the biggest battle was over @entity58 , which passed the @entity59 - controlled @entity34 in 2010			1
but the past year alone has seen fierce wrangling over the administration 's response to the deadly terror attack in september 2012 on the @entity15 diplomatic mission in @entity65 , @entity66			0
and there was the major fiscal cliff impasse over budget cuts and tax increases last march and in the first excruciating battle over spending and the debt limit in the summer of 2011			0
there has also been tension over @entity76 and @entity77			0
' bottom of the barrel ' while he said " there are no winners , " @entity2 used the moment to press his agenda			1
he urged @entity34 to determine the government 's spending and priorities for 2014 and beyond			1
he also urged lawmakers to pass an overdue farm bill that sets the country 's farming priorities and pays for food assistance			0
he wants the @entity7 to take up the immigration reform bill , which the @entity93 passed earlier this year , and has called for a return to " regular order , " where @entity34 approves budgets , reconciles differences and gets things done			1
playing nice : budget talks may start with an extra-friendly tone " the @entity15 people are completely fed up with @entity0 , " he said , reflecting polls that show support for @entity34 at historic lows			1
it 's an ambitious agenda , especially for a government fresh off a debilitating few weeks and tensions between the two branches are high and trust is low			1
one former @entity59 member of @entity34 , @entity111 , who represented @entity112 for 18 years and currently sits on the political reform commission at the @entity114 , said that the shutdown showdown brought about one bright spot			1
" i think we may have reached the bottom of the barrel , " meaning things in @entity0 " ca n't get any lower than this , " he said			1
in defeat , @entity122 may live to fight another day but former house speaker @entity124 disagreed			0
he said the most conservative members who wanted to gut @entity58 in exchange for government funding got little out of the budget deal are even more incensed			0
" they will be more embittered , more angry			0
they will find more ways to go after @entity2 because they ca n't find any way to get him to negotiate , " he said			1
@entity133 's statement rings true if rep. @entity134 , @entity135 , accurately represents his like - minded colleagues			0
he told the @entity137 that he thinks immigration reform is dead			0
" for us to go to a negotiation , to the negotiating table with president @entity2 after what he has done over the last two and a half weeks , i think would be probably a very big mistake , " @entity134 said			1
@entity7 minority leader @entity145 did n't mince words thursday morning			2
she said the @entity17 ' " temper tantrum " cost the economy $ 24 billion			0
' that 's democracy ' from his lectern , @entity2 tried to sound like the adult in the room			1
" democrats and @entity17 are far apart on a lot of issues and i recognize there are folks on the other side who think that my policies are misguided , " he said			0
" that 's putting it mildly			0
that 's how it work			0
" while he offered out his hand for future negotiations , @entity2 did n't stay completely above the fray			1
in the same sentence he blamed one faction of the @entity17 for the latest dysfunction , insisting that their goal is to cause chaos			0
" let 's work together to make government work better instead of treating it like an enemy or purposely making it work worse , " @entity2 said			1
why is @entity180 smiling ? understanding that he needs the @entity17 to get anything done in @entity0 , he separated the party into two factions and implored the more rebellious to stay in line			2
" you do n't like a particular policy or a particular president ? then argue for your position			1
go out there and win an election			0
push to change it but do n't break it			1
do n't break what our predecessors spent over two centuries building			2
that 's not being faithful to what this country is about , " he said			0
@entity201 : further shutdowns ' off the table ' @entity17 congressman : it was worth the fight while @entity2 tried to highlight the rifts in the @entity17 , perhaps hoping to exploit the divisions and then conquer , @entity17 appeared united , at least for a few hours wednesday night			2
moments before the @entity7 was set to vote on a deal to reopen the government , house speaker @entity122 received a standing ovation , even from his most vocal @entity17 critics			0
and one of those critics , rep. @entity216 , @entity217 , said @entity122 's leadership through the latest battle has been " fantastic			0
" then sen. @entity220 , @entity221 , put a damper on that party			0
" this was a terrible idea			0
i told you at the beginning how it was going to end			0
we know if they try it again how it 's going to end			0
so hopefully , they wo n't try to do this again , at least not in my lifetime , " @entity220 said .			2

president @entity2 emerged with an ambitious agenda moving forward
he implored @entity34 that their working relationship " has to change "
one former member says the relationship ca n't get much lower
