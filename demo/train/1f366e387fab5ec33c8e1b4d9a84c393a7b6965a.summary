on wednesday , the @entity1 and @entity2 homeland security committees held their first - ever joint hearing , on the 70th anniversary of the bombing of @entity6 , to address what has become a familiar theme for both committees -- the threat from " homegrown " terrorists			1
the hearing , chaired jointly by sen. @entity18 , i - @entity13 , and rep. @entity14 , @entity16 - @entity15 , examined the threat to " military communities " posed by domestic terrorism , a threat that @entity18 said last week " has increased dramatically " since 2006 , when he held his first hearing on the subject			2
@entity18 cited the attack , allegedly by @entity27 maj. @entity26 , that killed 13 soldiers and civilians at @entity30 , @entity31 , in 2009 ; the shooting death of a soldier outside an army recruiting station in @entity35 the same year ; and a purported plot by @entity37			0
@entity38 to attack soldiers near @entity30 with explosives and firearms this year			0
so what is the actual threat to @entity45 's military from homegrown terrorists ? the @entity47 and the @entity48 examined 192 cases of apparent homegrown terrorism by @entity52 militants since 9/11			1
we found that the @entity55 military at home and abroad is indeed a target for @entity52 extremist plots			1
in a third of the cases we studied , the individuals who were charged had targeted the @entity55 military			1
of those , a little under half targeted military facilities or personnel in the @entity55 , while 55 % were targeting @entity55 bases and troops overseas			2
additionally , attacks against military personnel have accounted for 14 of the 17 deaths attributed to jihadist terrorists in the @entity55 since 9/11 ( though all but one happened during the 2009 @entity30 shooting )			2
these deaths were all caused by gunfire , presumably because explosives are more difficult to acquire and build and often draw the attention of law enforcement			0
@entity55 law enforcement is quite focused on the threat of attacks against @entity55 military targets			1
a government informant or undercover government agent took part in the investigations of 60 % of the jihadist terrorism cases directed at @entity55 military targets			1
while some of the anti-military plots were serious , in particular the deadly assault on @entity30 , others were more aspirational than operational			2
@entity91 , for instance , is charged with hatching a harebrained plan to attack the @entity93 and @entity94 earlier this year using remote - controlled model aircraft loaded with explosives			0
@entity91 was snared by government informants who supplied him with the cash to take his " scouting trips " to scope out the targets , and even to buy the model planes that were to be used in the plot			0
he has pleaded not guilty			0
and the @entity104 declined to investigate @entity105 , a recent convert to @entity106 arrested by @entity15 police last month on charges of trying to build pipe bombs for use against @entity55 service members returning to the @entity55 because , as an anonymous law enforcement official told the @entity113 , " if the @entity104 declines a case , it 's not a strong case			2
' the desire of @entity52 militants to attack the @entity55 military may decline as the @entity55 completes its withdrawal from @entity121 this month and transitions away from combat operations toward a training mission in @entity125 over the next two years			1
@entity45 and the @entity48 also examined nonjihadist terrorist cases since 9/11 and found that while terrorists motivated by far right - wing or anti-government ideologies do not pose a threat to the @entity55 military , they do pose a real threat to @entity55 government personnel -- in particular to law enforcement			1
we examined the 118 cases of right - wing and left - wing terrorism since 9/11 and found that more than 40 % of them involved plans to strike government facilities and personnel , including federal and local law enforcement officers			0
police disrupted a number of such plots , such as the one allegedly organized by members of the " @entity149 " @entity148 militia last year in @entity150 , who authorities said planned to kill a police officer and later ambush the funeral procession using explosives			0
during the investigation of the @entity149 group , law enforcement seized machine guns and a variety of explosives			0
on monday one of the nine accused of the @entity150 plot pleaded guilty to weapons charges , the first to do so			0
the guilty plea in the @entity150 case underscores that while @entity52 terrorists do pose a threat to @entity55 service members , those with other types of extremist beliefs also pose a similar kind of threat to @entity55 government officials and @entity55 law enforcement			1
terrorist threats against @entity55 officials and police that have nothing to do with @entity52 militancy are surely also worthy of the scrutiny of @entity182 , but neither the @entity1 nor @entity2 homeland security committee , nor it seems any other congressional committee , has examined the issue in any detail since 9/11 .			1
