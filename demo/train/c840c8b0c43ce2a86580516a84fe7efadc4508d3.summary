the @entity31 started an investigation into @entity16 's actions in 2004 and concluded in may 2006 that he was guilty of sexual abuse , the group said			1
" we had thought and hoped that the accusations brought against our founder were false and unfounded , since they conflicted with our experience of him personally and his work , " the order 's statement said			2
as a result of the @entity31 investigation , however , officials at the @entity11 " reached sufficient moral certainty to impose serious canonical sanctions related to the accusations made against @entity16 , which included the sexual abuse of minor seminarians			1
therefore , though it causes us consternation , we have to say that these acts did take place , " the group said thursday			0

although leaders at the @entity11 knew of the abuse since may 2006 , they kept it quiet until this week			1

' " @entity16 died january 30 , 2008			1
@entity81 , spokesman for the sect in @entity6 and @entity83 , said legion leaders did not reveal the accusations sooner because " it has been a very difficult process			2
we were n't ready to assimilate it before			0
" now , he told @entity2 en @entity89 , " we have to recognize the facts as they are			1
" legion leaders acknowledged the delay , saying in thursday 's communique , " it 's taken us some time to assimilate these events of his life			0
for many -- above all the victims -- this time has been too long and painful			0
