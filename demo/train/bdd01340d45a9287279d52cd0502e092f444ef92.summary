-- @entity1 will take a 39 - second lead into the final stage of the @entity4 after fighting off a determined challenge from @entity6 in saturday 's deciding time trial stage			1
@entity8 's @entity1 had an eight - second advantage going into the 52km solo test from @entity11 to @entity12 and came under pressure from his @entity15 rival at the early time checks			1
for some fleeting moments it seemed possible that @entity6 could reclaim the yellow jersey , but as he tired , @entity1 , considered a far superior time triallist , increased his advantage			1
and at the finish , a relieved and tearful @entity1 had extended his lead by 31 seconds			2
" it was a very hard day			0
i 've worked so hard for so many years but today it really came right down to the wire			0
that 's why i 'm so emotional , " @entity1 told the official race website			2
" in fact , i think it 's the first tour i 've won where i 've been so emotional			0
" i want to thank all the people who have been there for me these last years			0
" both the top two were well adrift of the best time of @entity6 's @entity36 teammate @entity35			1
he powered around the course in one hour and 56 seconds to win the 19th stage by 17 seconds from @entity39 whose @entity42 - @entity41 teammate @entity40 finished third			2
@entity44 's @entity43 will claim the final podium position in @entity46 after leapfrogging @entity48 road race champion @entity47 of @entity8 for third overall with the best time trial performance of the leading contenders , who had to battle a rising wind over largely flat terrain			1
assuming no accidents on the 20th and final stage into the @entity59 capital on sunday , it will be the third @entity4 triumph for @entity61 's @entity1 after his 2007 and 2009 triumphs			1
he courted controversy by taking the overall race lead in the @entity65 on monday after @entity6 dropped his chain near the summit of a climb			0
@entity1 flouted recent convention by not waiting for him to fix the problem and was later jeered by fans as he donned the yellow jersey			0
@entity1 had gained 39 seconds on @entity6 , ironically the margin that will likely separate them at the finish in one of the closest fought tours in recent years			2
their head - to - head duel on the @entity80 in thursday 's final mountain stage will long be remembered , with @entity1 making a sporting concession to allow @entity6 to claim the victory while maintaining his slender but decisive advantage			1
@entity6 said he is determined to return next year to win the @entity4			2
" i 've always said i 've progressed ( in the time trial ) but to beat @entity1 is not easy			1
i gave it my all , and i just could n't beat him , " he said			0
" i 've won two stages here , so for that i 'm happy			0
i will come back next year to win			0
