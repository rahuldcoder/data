-- @entity2 says there are three keys to his campaign being successful : he needs you to know who he is , he needs to be on the ballot in as many states as possible and he needs other libertarians to support him			1
and for the next two months , @entity2 , the @entity12 candidate for president and acknowledged underdog , will be zig - zagging across the country to make those admittedly unique goals a reality			1
that is the thrust of his argument : once you get to know me , i swear you 'll like me			0
@entity2 has fashioned himself the " clear alternative " to @entity24 candidate @entity23 and president @entity25 in november 's presidential election			1
the most recent @entity0 / @entity28 poll shows that 3 % of likely voters and 4 % of registered voters say they 'd vote for @entity2			1
but the fact he is even included in a poll is enough to get @entity2 excited			1
" it is one thing if it gets reported that i am at 4 % nationally , " said @entity2 , the former governor of @entity36 , " but i do n't think i go down when people take a look at who i am and what i have done , i think it actually goes up			1
" and in some ways , he has proof to back that up			0
@entity2 first ran for governor of @entity36 -- a state with a majority of @entity48 voters -- in 1994 as a @entity24			1
he won in the @entity24 primary , defeating three other @entity24 , and then defeated an incumbent @entity48 governor by 10 points			0
after four years in office , @entity2 ran again and won in 1998			1
@entity2 's popularity remained consistently high through his time as governor , leading one paper to remark that he was " arguably the most popular governor of the decade			1
" @entity0 poll : could @entity2 be spoiler ? but he has his work cut out for him			1
the most notable third party presidential contenders are from the 1800s -- @entity63 , @entity64 -- and even they were largely independents because their original parties disowned them			0
the last third - party presidential candidate to make a significant run at the @entity69 was @entity70 in 1992			1
he ultimately carried no states and earned 19,743,821 votes			0
in 2000 , @entity74 candidate @entity73 was labeled as a " spoiler " after getting nearly 100,000 votes in @entity77			0
he was seen by some as siphoning votes away from @entity48 candidate @entity80 , who ultimately lost to @entity81 in the closest election in modern @entity84 history			0
and @entity2 , who first announced his candidacy as a @entity24 , only switched to @entity12 when his campaign failed to gain much traction during the primaries			1
he has huge burdens when it comes to fund - raising -- he had only $ 14,265 in cash on hand at the start of august -- and in organization , with a passionate but small collection of staff and volunteers in a handful of states			1
and then there 's name recognition : @entity2 who ? still , @entity2 believes he can defy the odds and make the unlikely climb			1
" i just need to catch a wave by the middle of october and awareness for me is a plus , " @entity2 told @entity0			2
" i do think that i have a resume to back up everything that i am talking about			0
" @entity2 says he is more liberal than @entity25 on social issues and more conservative than @entity23 on fiscal issues			2
he says same - sex marriage is a constitutional issue and should be legal , he supports legalizing marijuana usage and he says he would abolish the @entity117			0
the third - party candidate is optimistic and is devoting large sums of his own money to make this campaign possible -- much of which came from @entity123 , his mechanical contracting business in @entity36			1
but what @entity2 's here - is - what - we - have - to - do optimism fails to clearly show is the daunting challenge in front of him			1
@entity2 's ballot access gospel @entity2 is proud that he is likely going to be on the ballot in 47 states , even if that status is being challenged in three states -- @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			1
before being asked , @entity2 brings the ballot access issue up to differentiate himself from other third - party candidates , like the @entity74 's @entity141			1
" no other third party is going to come close to this 50 ballot access , " @entity2 says proudly			1
" i am a clear alternative to the other two and i want to point out that we are going to be on the ballot in all 50 states			2
" @entity2 sees the struggles to get on the ballots as a badge of honor			2
" we should take it as a compliment , " he said , that the party establishment does n't want him on the ballot			2
compliment or not -- even if you are on the ballot , people have to know who you are			0
hi , my name is @entity2 fighting for ballot access and libertarian support are all for naught , however , unless @entity2 is able to introduce himself to the @entity84 people , his campaign admits			1
at the heart of this introduction are the three prime - time presidential debates			0
" the only way i am ( going to be ) president of the @entity84 is if i am in the national debate between @entity25 and @entity23 , " @entity2 said			2
" if that takes place , then anything is possible			0
" the last time a third - party candidate was included in the presidential debates was 1992 , when @entity70 , an independent businessman , was running for president			1
and due to the fact that the three presidential debates have been announced without @entity2 's inclusion , the candidate admits it is n't likely he will be included			1
" it is absolutely an uphill battle , " @entity2 said , " but that is the only scenario by which i could actually win			2
" but @entity2 is n't putting all his stock in being included in the debates			2
he is taking his message on the road , hitting 16 college towns around the country in the next few weeks			0
in the statement announcing the trip , @entity2 touches upon the importance of the youth vote -- and in particular , the way young voters were inspired by another libertarian , rep. @entity198			2
a libertarian courting @entity200 it is unusual that the @entity12 candidate for president is being forced to court other libertarians , but that 's exactly what @entity2 has to do with the unflinchingly loyal base of libertarians who support former @entity24 hopeful @entity198			1
according to @entity2 , the @entity198 supporters are " absolutely pivotal " to his success			2
@entity2 acts surprised that he has to do this , too			2
" where does his support go ? " the former governor asks			0
" to @entity23 ? to @entity25 ? or to me ? " libertarians are a unique set of voters			0
while they agree on some things -- individual freedoms , the right to do what you want without government coercion and a generally liberal social policy -- they also share a fierce independent streak			0
that independence , which largely stems from the desire to make their own decisions , makes the libertarian movement less of a cohesive group and more of a set of factions exchanging ideas			0
when making his pitch to @entity198 supporters , @entity2 lists a litany of positions on which he and the former candidate agree			1
" i do n't want to bomb @entity240 , i want to bring the troops home , i want to end the drug war , " @entity2 says quickly			2
" i want to end the @entity243 , i want to balance the federal budget tomorrow and i want to abolish the @entity117			0
" but many @entity198 supporters do n't see those issues as that black - and - white			0
reaction to @entity2 's candidacy has been tepid and varied			2
he is definitely very close , " said @entity250 , a @entity198 grassroots organizer			0
" @entity2 is very much in line with dr. @entity198 on many issues , " said @entity251 , a performer who traveled with the @entity198 campaign			1
" ( it 's ) the first time we have had a viable third party candidate			1
" " i am not sure if i will vote for @entity2 , " said @entity259 , another @entity198 grassroots organizer			2
" i do n't see him as a principle @entity12			0
" @entity2 endorsed @entity198 in 2008 , when the @entity261 congressman was running for president , and when @entity2 dropped out of the race as a @entity24 in 2012 , he urged his supporters to vote for @entity198 in the @entity24 primaries			1
so far though , @entity198 has yet to give @entity2 much support in 2012			0
" we do n't have contact with the @entity198 , " @entity2 said bluntly			0
" i am not asking for his endorsement and i do n't expect his endorsement			0
" the tension between @entity198 and @entity2 is evidence of a larger split among libertarians			0
@entity198 commanded such a loyal following , that with his political career dwindling , there is power vacuum in the movement right now			0
with @entity64 as the party 's candidate , he is trying to position himself as the group 's heir apparent			0
" i am the @entity12 nominee for president , " @entity2 said			1
" i am now the spokesperson for the movement			0

@entity2 switched to the @entity12 when his campaign *stalled* in the primaries
the former @entity36 governor may be on the ballot in as many as 47 states
still , name recognition is one of his biggest *hurdles* as a third - party candidate
