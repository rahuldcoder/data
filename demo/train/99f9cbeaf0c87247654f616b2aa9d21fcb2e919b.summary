@entity0 -- @entity3 traveled with what amounted to a mini-clinic and an anesthesiologist who used a surgical anesthetic to put the singer to sleep after shows during his " @entity11 " tour , sources close to @entity3 told @entity1 just days after his death			1
but @entity13 testified friday that he never saw indications @entity3 used drugs or traveled with a doctor when he managed that tour in 1996 and 1997			1
what @entity13 knew -- or did n't know -- about @entity3 's drug use is a key issue as the @entity3 wrongful death trial enters its sixth week monday in @entity0			1
the co-ceo of @entity23 -- the concert promotion company being sued by @entity3 's mother and children -- returns for a fifth day of testimony monday			1
the jackson family contends @entity23 is liable in @entity3 's 2009 death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity30 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter			1
@entity13 was the top producer of @entity3 's comeback concerts when the singer died of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol			1
it was @entity13 who negotiated the deal to pay dr. @entity30 $ 150,000 a month to be @entity3 's physician for the " @entity42 " tour			1
@entity3 lawyers argue that @entity44 should have known the hazards of hiring the doctor because of his personal experience with @entity3 -- and his work with other artists , including on @entity51 's last tour			1
@entity23 lawyers contend their executives had no way of knowing that @entity30 was using propofol to treat @entity3 's insomnia because the singer was very good at keeping his " deepest , darkest secret			1
" " @entity23 knew nothing about this decade - long propofol use , " @entity23 lawyer @entity59 said in his opening statements			2
" they were a concert promoter			0
how could they know ? " what killed @entity51 ? it 's a question at @entity3 's death trial @entity13 , under questioning by his own lawyer friday , testified that he only became aware that @entity3 was addicted to painkillers when the singer made a public announcement after his " dangerous " tour abruptly ended so he could enter rehab in 1993			1
he was a manager for the " @entity75 " tour , but only handled logistics and did n't travel with @entity3 then , he said			2
his job on the second half of the " @entity11 " tour , however , carried more responsibilities and he worked closely with @entity3 , he said			1
@entity13 testified that he saw " no indication at all " that @entity3 was using drugs during that tour			1
" i would be certain to notice it if that was the case			0
" did @entity3 have a doctor treating him during the " @entity11 " tour , his lawyer asked			2
" not that i know of , " he answered			0
in fact , @entity3 was " sensational " on stage , performing 10 to 12 shows a month , he said			2
unlike in the " dangerous " tour , he never canceled a show because of his health			0
" he only missed one , " he said			0
" that was when princess @entity97 died			0
he heard about the accident , went to bed , woke up , found she passed away and it affected him deeply			0
" but an interview that @entity3 gave to @entity102 weeks after @entity97 's death could help @entity3 lawyers refute @entity106 's claim that no doctor traveled with the singer during the tour			1
@entity102 asked @entity3 about how he learned the news that his friend , the princess , had died			2
" i woke up and my doctor gave me the news , and i fell back down in grief and i started to cry , " @entity3 said			2
" that 's why the inner pain , the pain in my stomach and in my chest , so i said ' i can not handle this			0
' " promoter grilled about ' smoking gun ' e-mail @entity3 's statement that a doctor was at his bedside when he woke up the day of a scheduled " @entity11 " show in @entity129 is not the only evidence he did have a physician on the tour			1
dr. @entity133 , an anesthesiologist from @entity134 , has acknowledged that he traveled with @entity3 during part of the tour			2
he was at @entity137 , @entity138 , in july 1997 when a stage collapsed and @entity3 suffered a back injury			0
it was two months before @entity97 's death			0
dr. @entity133 declined to talk about his treatment of @entity3 when @entity1 's dr. @entity145 confronted him outside his @entity147 , @entity134 , home in july 2009 , although he did confirm that @entity3 had trouble sleeping			2
" it 's really something i do n't want to talk about right now , " he told dr. @entity145			0
a source who was close to @entity3 told @entity145 in 2009 that when @entity3 had trouble sleeping that dr. @entity133 helped " take him down " and " bring him back up			0
" @entity133 , who was convicted of insurance fraud and stripped of his license to practice medicine for three years in 2002 , is on the witness list for the trial and has been questioned in a deposition by each side			0
@entity163 -- @entity3 's former wife and the mother of his two oldest children -- will testify that she assisted in administering propofol to @entity3 in the 1990s when she was a nurse , @entity23 's @entity59 said on the opening day of the trial			1
@entity23 exec called @entity3 ' freak ' before signing concert contract " she saw several doctors put mr. @entity3 to sleep in hotel rooms while on tour , " @entity59 said , including in @entity137 , @entity173 , @entity174			1
but @entity13 and others did not know , he said			0
" the truth is mr. @entity3 fooled everyone , " @entity59 said about @entity3 's propofol use			2
" he kept those who might have helped him at a distance and no one knew his deepest , darkest secret			0
" @entity3 's ability to keep his private side private meant @entity23 executives could not see any red flags warning of @entity3 's destruction , @entity59 said			1
" they did n't see this coming , " he said			0
" they had no idea			0
" @entity59 said @entity3 family members -- including @entity197 and her famous siblings -- will testify about their failed attempts at intervention and their lack of knowledge about what was happening			0
" if they did n't know what was going on , how could someone else think there was even a problem , " he said			0
but @entity3 lawyers will argue that @entity13 , who closely watched expenses on the " @entity11 " tour because it was losing money at one point , would have noticed spending on hotel rooms and fees for a doctor traveling with the tour .			1
