-- the southern @entity2 city of @entity3 has been eulogized by artists since the @entity5			2
the poet @entity6 wrote : " in front of storied buildings everywhere waft the melodies of flutes , and by the door of every house are moored ships and boats			2
" today , @entity3 's classical gardens are @entity16 and its canal network , bisected by gorgeous stone bridges , has earned the nickname , " the @entity20			1
" yet when our small convoy of cyclists approached the city that so impressed @entity27 traveler @entity26 in the 12th century , there was little to wax lyrical about			2
the whole of the @entity30 was enshrouded in headline - making smog			1
i 'd run into veteran @entity2 rock musician @entity33 in @entity35 just before i 'd set off on @entity36 , a three - week , 2,000 - kilometer charity bike ride from @entity35 to @entity38 organized by @entity39			1
@entity40 had retreated south for the winter to avoid " the smog and cold " of @entity43			1
" the country 's done , " he complained			1
" only in the mountains will you find unpolluted areas			2
" his words would prove prophetic			2
foreboding odors our journey began with much media fanfare in downtown @entity35 in mid-november			1
cycling smooth roads though some of @entity2 's most prosperous neighborhoods furnished a false sense of security			1
as soon as we exited the old @entity59 the experience rapidly descended into one of brute survival along the gravel coated , anarchic roads of the @entity64			2
@entity35 's @entity70 district , the city of @entity66 and much of the provincial capital of @entity68 comprise the world 's largest manufacturing base			1
only three decades ago this land was a patchwork of rice paddies and fruit plantations			2
now it 's a sea of concrete , hurriedly and carelessly erected by entrepreneurs racing to squeeze quick cash from @entity2 's newly opened economy			1
the economic reforms that began in the south have lifted many out of poverty , but the environment has borne a heavy toll for progress			0
by day two , we were cycling seemingly endless roads , lined by indistinguishable factories beneath anonymous and repetitive gray skies			0
each waterway we crossed emanated a foreboding odor			0
it might sound surprising , but most of the time cycling through the pollution did n't affect me as much as you might think			0
there was one episode , however , on the leg between @entity104 and @entity3 , when the pollution was at its worst			0
feeling nauseous , i ended up falling behind the team because i had to stop to retch at the side of the road			0
the air literally sickened me			1
sixty percent of the world 's concrete on day three we finally left the manufacturing lands behind			1
beyond the scenic city of @entity117 , our troop of seven cyclists pedaled along relatively empty roads through broad expanses of green , undulating farmland			1
but construction was never far away			0
even in the hinterland , real estate companies are busy erecting malls and high - rise apartment buildings			1
according to various sources , as much as 60 % of the world 's cement is dumped annually in @entity2 , creating a dust cloud that @entity130 has photographed from space			1
many in @entity2 stoically maintain environmental damage is a consequence of the transition from a feudal agrarian society to a modern , predominantly urban one			0
the words of industrializing @entity140 's laureate , @entity139 , are often invoked			1
did n't @entity142 experience the same thing ? and has n't it cleaned up its act since ? the difference , of course , is that @entity2 's industrial revolution and urbanization program is of a scale unsurpassed in human history , a continental shift that 's creating huge conurbations , as cities , like those of the @entity64 , converge			1
alarmingly , some detractors even believe much of the construction may be pointless			0
" it is said that there are 64 million empty apartments in @entity2 , " @entity159 - based analyst @entity158 told @entity160			1
indeed , on @entity164 we passed through more than a few potemkin towns -- shiny , new and all but empty			0
all is not lost @entity167 's sentiments resonated with me when we engaged our first mountain range late on day three			2
only in remote and hilly regions , where it would be unprofitable to build , is @entity2 's environment unspoiled			2
of course , for cyclists mountains pose a different challenge			0
while we got stunning views -- bamboo forests , sequestered villages , isolated @entity182 monasteries -- cycling uphill for hours on end was grueling			0
we completed day three well after nightfall , thighs burning as we rolled into the tiny market town of @entity186			0
this pattern of heinous urban cycling followed by a few days of scenic , if challenging , rural riding would define our journey north to @entity38			1
@entity191 in eastern @entity193 province and the western @entity194 in @entity196 province are emerging mega-cities			0
yet between them , in the rural areas of southern and northern @entity196 , the rugged lands given over to tea cultivation are majestic			0
villagers wearing bamboo hats toil in fields before stunning mountain vistas -- a picture - postcard @entity2 far removed from the " booming " economic centers			2
our third province , @entity209 , would also provide one day of fine rural riding			0
several degrees north of our starting point in the subtropics we were now battling the cold			0
but an autumnal myriad of red and orange deciduous trees more than compensated for the chilly condition along road between @entity218 and @entity219			0
" never seen air like this			2
" beyond @entity219 , however , we navigated through smog all the way to the outskirts of @entity38			1
" the air quality index reached 305 by midnight , or severely polluted , the highest level , " @entity225 reported			1
throughout the region , flights had been canceled , schools closed			0
all the while the @entity232 team pressed on toward the finish line			0
remarkably , the air cleared considerably just as we entered @entity2 's showcase metropolis			1
after three weeks overcoming soaring mountains and sprawling cities , we rolled to the finish outside the @entity240 in @entity241 to be welcomed by an applauding crowd			0
we 'd raised 400,000 yuan ( $ 66,000 ) for charity having cycled more than 2,000 kilometers			1
our typically self - effacing team indulged in the adulation			2
the next day as we packed our bags , despite the glowing sense of achievement , the team traded despondent words with regards to @entity2 's environmental plight			2
" i 've never seen air like we saw in @entity209 , " said @entity253 , a 21 - year - old chef from @entity255 province			1
" my friends are all buying fancy cars			0
i do n't want to be like them , " added @entity259 , 52 , from @entity159			0
" we 're destroying our world ! " but it was @entity263 , a cycling enthusiast from @entity255 , who best summed up the contrast between the grotesque and the gorgeous we 'd witnessed cycling @entity2 's southeast			1
" the big mountains and scenery have lifted my spirit more than i can say , but the pollution has been too serious			0
i wish there was some way to tell the world how liberating and non-polluting cycling is			0

the author pedaled more than 2,000 kilometers , much of it through epic smog
charity bike ride started in @entity35 , finished in @entity38
some area of ride were gorgeous and smog - free
most of the riders in author 's group found the air quality *disturbing*
