-- students in @entity2 , @entity3 , are likely eating a better lunch than you today			1
on the menu in their cafeterias ? chicken salad on a bed of spinach with strawberries and @entity13 oranges			0
roughly 76 % of students in @entity18 qualify for free or reduced - cost meals under the @entity20			1
since the program 's nutritional guidelines went into place in 2012 , school administrators have been getting creative with their food program to create meals children like			1
" taste testing is where it 's at , " said @entity27 , the district 's director of school nutrition			0
" they 're your customers			2
it 's like running a business			0
" @entity27 said her team has worked hard to implement the new guidelines , which are entering a third school year this fall			2
the ultimate goal is to reduce childhood obesity , which according to the @entity41 , has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in 30 years			0
gone are the days of mystery meats and grilled cheese on white bread			0
instead , participating schools in the federal lunch program are required to serve skim or low - fat milk , add more whole grains , include a fruit and vegetable at each meal and prepare food with zero grams of trans fat per serving			1
calorie and sodium limitations are also in place			0
" with one - third of @entity60 children obese or overweight , members in both parties agreed that @entity60 ' tax dollars should fund healthy and wholesome food , " said @entity59 , the @entity60 @entity62 's undersecretary for food , nutrition and consumer services			1
@entity62 new rules for school meals about 90 % of schools are now in compliance with the new guidelines , according to the @entity62 , with students eating about 16 % more vegetables and 23 % more fruit on a daily basis			1
but there 's been controversy over the program 's implications for school food budgets			0
the @entity62 says 1 million fewer students nationwide are eating federal school lunches since the guidelines were enacted in 2012 -- either by personal choice , or because their schools have opted out of the lunch program altogether			1
what it really comes down to , experts say , is money			0
wealthier school districts can turn down federal reimbursements if their students are n't enjoying the healthier fare			1
districts with more students who qualify for the program , such as in @entity2 , often do n't have a choice			2
economics of school lunch established in 1946 , the @entity20 was created to provide free or low - cost meals to students			1
although the program is optional in most states , the federal reimbursement for students ' meals is so significant that some schools find it too expensive to run programs on their own , said @entity112 , â € @entity113 of media relations at the @entity115 , a national organization of school nutrition professionals			1
the @entity115 was instrumental in helping the @entity118 administration put these new nutrition guidelines in place ; now the organization is lobbying for schools to be allowed to opt out			1
opponents say food companies are working behind the scenes , trying to keep their less - healthy items on the menu longer			0
the @entity62 gives schools in the continental @entity60 $ 0.28 per lunch for students who pay full price			1
for students in need , the @entity62 pays almost 10 times more : $ 2.58 for those who qualify for reduced price meals and $ 2.98 for children who qualify for a free lunch			1
it is n't surprising then that state agencies reported to the @entity62 that students leaving the program were mainly from residential child care institutions , wealthier districts and / or smaller schools with low percentages of children eligible for free and reduced - price meals			1
@entity147 in @entity148 is one such district that decided to opt out for the 2014 - 2015 academic year			0
the local high school was losing students to its rivals : subway and a handful of convenience stores down the street			2
with an open campus , students can leave for lunch , and administrators say the daily exodus increased after new nutritional guidelines went into effect two years ago			1
this meant less money being spent in the cafeteria			0
" the guidelines are too strict and the kids can leave , " said @entity167 , the school district 's food and nutrition director			2
" if they are n't eating with us , they 're leaving and eating junk			2
" @entity167 says the biggest challenges were the calorie and sodium restrictions required by the federal program			2
the students wanted more protein and larger portions , especially athletes			2
the school has a robust football program that has won 22 @entity148 state championships			0
@entity188 in @entity189 and @entity190 in @entity191 also have called it quits , citing burdensome regulations , hungry children and a decline in food sales that led to large amounts of debt			0
like @entity199 , these school districts are in areas with relatively high median incomes and have a low percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced meals			2
@entity205 : let them eat ... whatever schools that predominantly serve low - income students have fared better in both revenue gains and participation , according to the @entity62			1
since they are unable to opt out of the program , and students ca n't afford to eat elsewhere , cafeteria workers are making the new rules work			0
the @entity215 , which has one the highest concentrations of low - income students in @entity218 , is an example			0
since the nutrition guidelines were established , there has been a 14 % increase of participation in its school lunch program			1
testing taste buds for some schools , labor and food costs , and the quality of kitchen equipment can play a role in whether their revamped food program is a success , says @entity235			0
schools in small and rural areas may also have local vendors and distributors that do n't carry a great deal of healthy food options			0
@entity167 in @entity148 , for example , found that foods that met the new dietary guidelines from her vendors did n't taste all that great			0
she says companies are trying , but may just need more time to reformulate their foods so they taste better			0
" it 's important to keep in mind that all school meal programs are different , " @entity235 explained			0
" some communities have an easier time if students are more familiar with healthy foods at home			0
" most students seem to be liking the healthier lunches despite some early negative feedback			2
a survey published in the @entity262 journal reported that 70 % of elementary school children , 70 % of middle schoolers and 63 % of high school students liked their school 's meals			2
and schools opting out of the federal lunch program are n't necessarily serving unhealthy fare			1
in the @entity199 district , @entity167 said schools will continue to serve extra fruits and vegetables at no charge and add back larger portions of protein and the popular homemade soups , which had to be discontinued due to the @entity20 's calorie restrictions			1
she said she has received calls from vendors selling unhealthy foods after the school district announced it was leaving the federal program , but she made it clear her schools have always offered healthy foods			2
soft drinks and candy bars are n't on the menu			0
for those schools remaining in the @entity20 , the @entity62 is offering technical support , help with recipes and financial assistance			1
according to the @entity62 , about $ 48 million in grants is still available to schools with lunch programs			1
" the @entity62 continues to help schools by demonstrating flexibility and common sense as we work together to improve the health of the nation 's next generation , " @entity59 said			1
" the department will continue to provide additional funding and training to schools as progress continues			0

@entity62 : students eating more fruits and vegetables with lunch guidelines enacted in 2012
it says 90 % of schools are in compliance ; schools with more federal aid growing programs
some schools with students who pay full price for lunches say they 're losing revenue
