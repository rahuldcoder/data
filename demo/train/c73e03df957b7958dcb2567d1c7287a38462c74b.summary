-- @entity2 members sunday called for a joint peacekeeping mission in @entity4 with the @entity5 and urged members to support the @entity4 opposition as it faces a bloody government crackdown			1
the moves are aimed at putting additional pressure on @entity4 president @entity11 and his government , which has unleashed its army on a popular revolt			1
the proposed peacekeeping mission would oversee the aftermath of a cease - fire , the @entity16 - based @entity2 announced sunday			1
but @entity4 quickly said it was not on board with the idea			1
the @entity2 suspended @entity4 's membership in january , and the @entity4 government announced that any decision made without it " is not binding			1
" the proposal reflects " the state of hysteria affecting some @entity30 governments , especially @entity31 and @entity32 , after @entity31 's failure to pass a @entity5 resolution that allows foreign intervention in @entity4 , " according the @entity4 government			1
the league , which suspended @entity4 in january , said its members have decided to end the previous monitoring mission , which had been in @entity4 in december and january , to request a joint @entity5 - @entity2 peacekeeping mission			1
a @entity40 issued after sunday 's meeting called on members to " open channels of communication " with @entity4 opposition groups and provide " political and financial support			1
" it urged members to cut diplomatic and economic ties with @entity50 " except for those that directly affect @entity4 citizens			1
" and it warned , " the use of violence against @entity4 civilians with this extreme cruelty , including the targeting of women and children , lies under the jurisdiction of the international criminal law and requires the punishment of its perpetrators			1
" the @entity66 , a network of opposition activists , praised the @entity2 for " making the decision to improve its performance in its national and humanitarian duty to the @entity4 people			1
" " we therefore appeal to brotherly and friendly nations , international organizations and non-governmental organizations around the world to expedite development and relief programs to help @entity4 in overcoming the daily oppression and injustice under which they live , " the @entity66 said			1
" we also call on all @entity4 political and activist entities to coordinate their efforts under a consolidated framework to ensure that relief supplies and other assistance are delivered immediately to those who need them			1
" @entity5 officials say about 6,000 have been killed since last march , when @entity11 began cracking down on peaceful protests against his government			0
@entity4 has consistently blamed " armed terrorist groups " for the violence , and its allies , @entity94 and @entity95 , vetoed a @entity5 resolution february 4 that was aimed at bringing an end to the strife			1
the @entity2 said sunday it would ask the @entity5 to consider its initiative " as soon as possible , " although the timetable for any action is unknown			1
and earlier , @entity2 secretary - general @entity102 signaled that he 'd had recent communications with @entity94 foreign minister @entity104 indicating that @entity105 may alter its positions			2
in a written statement , @entity102 quoted a letter he said was written by @entity104 , stating that an end to " any violence must be the main pillar for any proposal			0
" " we are ready to support an expanded monitoring mission and folding it under the joint care of the @entity2 and the @entity5 on the basis of an agreement from all involved parties , " @entity102 quoted @entity104			1
there was no immediate comment from @entity94 's government about the reported communication or any significant shift in that nation 's position			0
also sunday , former @entity129 foreign minister @entity130 was named the league 's envoy to @entity4 , @entity129 's state news agency @entity128 reported			1
he will replace lt. gen. @entity133 , of @entity134 as head of the monitoring mission			0
@entity137 : 3 military options in @entity4 the latest maneuvering came as opposition activists reported another day of shelling by @entity4 forces around the city of @entity144			1
one opposition activist said government forces are using detained civilians as human shields , placing them on tanks to prevent the opposition @entity150 from fighting back			2
residents say shelling rained on the city 's @entity144 neighborhood once again sunday , for at least the eighth straight day			2
" my house is dancing			0
i am almost dead because of the siege , " said the opposition activist , named @entity157			0
@entity0 can not independently confirm details of the fighting in @entity4 because the government has severely limited the access of international journalists			1
but despite denials by @entity4 , virtually all reports from within the country indicate @entity11 's forces are slaughtering protesters and other civilians en masse			1
in @entity50 , meanwhile , the state - run @entity171 reported that @entity11 has received a copy of a new constitution -- a development it said shows @entity4 's serious moves toward reform			2
" when the new constitution is approved , @entity4 will have passed the most important stage of laying down the constitutional and legal structure ... to take the country to a new era of cooperation with all spectrums of the @entity4 people to achieve what we all aspire for in terms of developing our country to draw a brilliant future for next generations , " @entity171 quoted @entity11			2
but the @entity66 said at least 30 more people died sunday , including a woman and two children			0
the dead included five in @entity144 and nine in @entity198 , it said			2
the @entity199 , another opposition activist group , reported different numbers , including 14 dead in @entity144			1
that figure includes a child killed by a sniper in @entity198 , three civilians killed in the @entity144 shelling and a civilian shot dead near the town of @entity208			2
the observatory also said a member of @entity4 's army was killed in @entity198 and eight were killed in @entity213 , as were civilians in each city			2
@entity4 said sunday , via @entity171 , that " martyrs " of two terrorist attacks in @entity218 were buried			2
how @entity4 differs from @entity219 the situation continues to draw commentary and proposals from prominent figures @entity224 was @entity226 leader @entity225 who , in a video posted online saturday , characterized @entity11 " the butcher son of a butcher " and praising the @entity4 people for waging " jihad			2
" a @entity233 official said " it is not a surprise that @entity238 would try to appear relevant by releasing this new video , " noting that he also tried to do so during @entity235 's recent revolution			0
the official added there is no sense that @entity4 opposition leaders favor their nation moving toward " extremism , " if @entity11 is ousted			1
then on sunday , from @entity246 in the @entity247 , pope @entity245 backed " legitimate aspirations " of the @entity4 people and called on " everyone , and above all the political authorities in @entity4 , to favor the paths of dialogue , reconciliation and commitment to peace			2
" the international community has repeatedly failed to convince @entity11 's regime to stop the massacre , so it 's unclear what effect the @entity2 proposal could have			0
@entity32 is among the most outspoken nations , with foreign minister @entity263 saying sunday that " the @entity4 leadership has chosen chaos			0
" " it is killing its people and destroying the nation only to maintain its authority , " he said			0
" what is happening in @entity4 leaves no doubt that it is not ethnic or sectarian war or urban warfare			0
it is a campaign of mass cleansing to punish the @entity4 people and enforce the regime 's authority without any humanitarian or ethical regards			0
" the @entity32 have brought forth a draft resolution that it expected to be considered monday by @entity5 diplomats			0
it will be submitted to the @entity282 , where vetoes are not allowed , but resolutions are not legally binding			0
@entity94 and @entity95 have vetoed previous @entity286 attempts at passing a resolution condemning the @entity4 regime			0
the latest , three - page draft " strongly condemns " the violations of human rights by @entity4 authorities			0
it cites " the use of force against civilians , arbitrary executions , killing and persecution of protesters , human rights defenders and journalists , arbitrary detention , enforced disappearances , interference with access to medical treatment , torture , sexual violence and ill - treatment , including against children			0
" the text was provided to @entity0 by a diplomatic source on the condition that it not be posted in full because it could be amended			0
@entity5 officials estimate 6,000 people have died since protests seeking @entity11 's ouster began nearly a year ago			0
the @entity66 says the toll has far exceeded 7,000 , with nearly 700 killed in the past week -- about two - thirds of them in @entity144			0
@entity0 's @entity328 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 and journalist @entity327 contributed to this report .			0
