-- it may be months before @entity4 's @entity3 seat is filled , following his death at the age of 77 on tuesday			1
the seat may remain in @entity4 hands			2
his sons , @entity11 and rep. @entity12 of @entity13 , have been mentioned as possible successors , as has his nephew , former rep. @entity17 ii. @entity4 's wife , @entity20 , has no interest in filling the seat , a source close to the senator said			2
a long - term vacancy could have effects far beyond @entity4 's home state of @entity26 , since his death deprives @entity28 of the 60 - vote " supermajority " with which they can theoretically force laws through the @entity3 despite @entity33 objections			1
under @entity26 law , a special election must be held 145 to 160 days after a @entity3 seat becomes vacant			1
the winner of that election serves the remainder of a senator 's unexpired term			0
just last week , @entity4 urged that the law be changed to allow the governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election can be held			1
in a letter to gov. @entity47 and other state leaders , @entity4 said he supports the current law , but added , " i also believe it is vital for [ @entity26 ] to have two voices speaking for the needs of its citizens and two votes in the @entity3 during the approximately five months between a vacancy and an election			1
" @entity4 asked the governor and state leaders to " amend the law through the normal legislative process to provide for a temporary gubernatorial appointment until the special election occurs			1
" @entity47 said wednesday that he is in favor of the change and would sign it into law if the state legislature passed it			1
he said @entity4 's proposal for an interim appointment until a special election was " entirely reasonable			1
" " i think particularly now , when you think about the momentous change legislation that is pending in the @entity78 today , @entity26 needs two voices , " @entity47 said in an interview with @entity75 radio station @entity74			2
@entity4 's letter is dated july 2 but was not sent until august 19 -- less than a week before he died			0
@entity4 , who had been having conversations with several top state @entity28 about a potential succession , was concerned that releasing the letter would disrupt intense and tumultuous @entity3 health care negotiations , a source close to the senator said			1
@entity4 sent the letter when he did only because the @entity90 newspaper learned about the discussions and was prepared to print what he thought was an inaccurate account of his efforts , according to that source and another person close to @entity4			0
he decided to make his desires clear by delivering the letter , knowing it would go public			0
@entity4 has championed universal health care for years and wanted to make sure @entity28 have the votes they may need for passage of a comprehensive bill			2
he called the issue " the cause of my life , " and he hoped to see legislation that would " guarantee that every @entity106 will have decent , quality health care as a fundamental right , " as he said at the @entity109			0
ireport.com : share tributes to @entity4 @entity28 -- who , in collaboration with independent sens. @entity115 of @entity116 and @entity117 of @entity118 , now control 59 of the 99 occupied seats in the 100 - member @entity3 -- face a tough battle this fall on president @entity123 's health care reform package			2
they have been trying to calculate votes without @entity4 , who was unable to attend many sessions for months because of his illness			2
until 2004 , @entity26 law allowed the governor to appoint an immediate replacement in the event of a @entity3 vacancy			1
the heavily @entity28 legislature changed the law , however , after @entity26 sen. @entity134 became the likely @entity28 presidential nominee -- when @entity33 @entity136 was governor			1
critics charged the @entity28 were trying to prevent @entity136 from replacing @entity134 with a @entity33 in the event of a @entity134 victory over president @entity140			0
it is not clear who will replace @entity4 in the seat he had held since 1962			2
he died 15 months after being diagnosed with brain cancer			0
his brother , the late president @entity145 , had the seat for almost eight years before being elected to the @entity147 in 1960			0
the old law may have helped the @entity3 seat stay in the family			1
when @entity145 was elected president , @entity4 was not yet old enough to be a senator			0
@entity4 family friend @entity153 was appointed to the seat but did not run in 1962 when @entity145 's term expired , clearing the way for @entity4			0
