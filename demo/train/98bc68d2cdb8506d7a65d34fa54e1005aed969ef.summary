-- there he goes again -- @entity4 president @entity3 , portraying himself as the world 's champion of peace and democracy			1
and , of course , doing it at @entity12 's expense			0
this time , @entity3 's pr machine managed to get him an op - ed in the @entity15 , just in time for the start of talks in @entity18 , @entity19 , over a plan to dismantle @entity22 's chemical weapons arsenal			1
the column is so filled with hypocrisy , inaccuracies and even veiled threats that it 's hard to know where to begin			0
@entity3 chastises the @entity12 , which has stumbled badly in @entity22 , for considering an attack because a strike " will result in more innocent victims and escalation			1
" it could , he warns , " unleash a new wave of terrorism			0
" he forgets to mention that tens of thousands of innocent victims in @entity22 have already died at the hands of president @entity39 's forces , which are armed , supported and supplied by @entity40			1
here 's just one recent arms order from a @entity22 army general , listing 20,000 kalashnikov rifles , 20 million rounds of ammunition , sniper rifles , machine guns , grenade launchers and more			2
when it comes to massacres of civilians , it is the @entity4 ( and @entity53 ) - armed @entity22 government and its allies who have done most of the killing			1
some of the rebels also have blood on their hands , clearly a reason for concern			0
but @entity3 's one - sided portrayal is false			2
a report by a @entity65 commission released wednesday showed eight massacres committed by @entity39 supporters and one by rebels over the last year and a half			0
@entity3 has provided @entity39 with weapons , planeloads of cash and diplomatic cover to carry out his assaults against an uprising that started peacefully and was forced into violence by @entity39 's uncompromising response			1
and yet in his op - ed @entity3 cynically describes the @entity22 war as conflict " fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition			1
" the @entity4 president tries to come across as the great defender of international institutions , peace through compromise and global consensus			2
" no one wants the @entity65 to suffer the fate of the @entity92 , " he warns , which would happen if the @entity12 chooses to bypass the @entity89			2
the truth , whatever @entity3 claims , is that the @entity12 and other countries have tried desperately to go through the @entity89 to stop the carnage in @entity22			1
no country has obstructed those efforts more persistently than @entity4			2
early last year , when @entity39 's forces carried out what was until then the worst massacre of the war , in the city of @entity104 , the @entity12 , @entity105 , @entity106 -- in fact , 13 out of the @entity89 's 15 members -- voted in favor of a resolution backing an @entity111 peace plan for @entity22			1
@entity4 and @entity112 vetoed it			2
experts then said the outcome would be a " license ( for @entity39 ) to do more of the same and worse , " predicting the @entity22 leader would become even more brutal in his tactics , exactly as he has			2
@entity4 has obstructed even the most watered - down efforts to send a message from the international community , vetoing three separate resolutions			2
it 's no wonder @entity124 , @entity12 's ambassador to the @entity65 , said @entity4 has held the @entity89 " hostage			1
" in his column , @entity3 disingenuously claims " there is every reason to believe " the rebels launched the august 21 chemical attack that killed hundreds of @entity22 civilians			1
precisely the opposite is true			0
analyses from the @entity12 , @entity105 , the @entity106 , @entity134 and others have concluded that it was the regime that perpetrated that gross violation of international norms -- the norms that @entity3 now claims to embrace with such fervor			1
a @entity65 inspection team investigated the massacre in @entity22 but was not tasked with assigning blame			0
still , leaked information says its report next week will show " a wealth of evidence " pointing strongly to the @entity22 regime as perpetrator of the attack , even if that does n't fit neatly with @entity3 's reality distortion objectives			1
nothing could be more deliciously absurd than @entity3 accusing @entity12 of not being a " model of democracy , " except perhaps for his closing line in which he chastises president @entity157 for speaking of @entity12 exceptionalism			1
@entity157 should n't have said that , @entity3 humbly explains , because " we are all different , but when we ask for the @entity162 's blessings , we must not forget that @entity163 created us equal			0
that coming from the man who has presided over the introduction of law after law turning gays and lesbians into second - class citizens in @entity4 , with the latest allowing police to arrest anyone suspected of being " pro-gay			0
" @entity3 would do well to avoid the topic of democracy and human rights altogether			0
just ask the nonpartisan @entity177 what has happened to the country since @entity3 came to dominate the political scene more than a decade ago			0
incidentally , @entity3 rose to power by cracking down violently against @entity182			0
here 's an op - ed he published in the @entity15 in 1999 explaining why force was needed against brutality			1
in this latest newspaper column , @entity3 extends to the @entity12 his image - building campaign from @entity4 , where he has appeared hunting tigers in @entity189			1
in @entity4 he is the hyper - macho president			0
in @entity12 and in the rest of the world , he wants the public to see him as the indispensable foil to an out - of - control @entity12			2
@entity3 wants to raise not only his own but also @entity4 's profile and prestige			1
it 's not so much that he dislikes @entity12 exceptionalism			0
he wants @entity4 to share in the limelight and in the power			0
the former @entity204 man is trying to maximize the influence of a country that once shared the title of superpower only with the @entity12			0
to do that , he wants to save @entity39 , the man who holds the key to @entity4 's foothold in the @entity111 @entity212			1
no , @entity3 's actions are not driven by a passion for peace and democracy			0
they are an example of cold calculation -- a quest for power and a bold display of hypocrisy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			0

@entity228 : in op - ed , @entity3 poses as champion of peace and chastises @entity12 on @entity22
on contrary , @entity4 sold arms to @entity39 regime , which has killed tens of thousands , she says
she says he touts diplomacy , yet @entity4 , @entity112 *subverted* peace efforts on @entity89
@entity243 : @entity3 wants to raise stock ( not peace ) in world and keep @entity4 foothold in @entity212
