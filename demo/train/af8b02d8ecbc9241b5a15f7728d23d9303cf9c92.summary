continuing to address the fallout of the @entity6 ( and the @entity8 universe )			0
since all eyes have been on @entity4 's character and his panic moonwalk lately , we caught up with the man himself to find out a little more about his musical tastes			1
( @entity18 : his co-star 's band made the list			1
) read on to see what 's on @entity4 's @entity24 : @entity25 , " @entity26 " " i 'm going nuts for this these days			1
i got into @entity25 when i was 15 at random , and every few months , i 'll put a different @entity25 on			1
and @entity25 's the only musician for me that kind of sets a tone for how the world should be			1
you just get caught up in his view of @entity34 , and he 's the only guy where i 'm like , ' i think he 's right			1
that weirdo 's got it figured out			1
' i 'm coming off of ' @entity37 ' which is so great , but this is one of those albums i 've never heard of			0
and i could n't believe it			0
but ' @entity26 ' is early ' 90s , so i thought it was going to be terrible , but it is great @entity25			1
because , you know , every once in a while @entity25 would have an album where you 're just like , pass			1
i 'm not going down that road with you in the ' 80s , @entity25			1
i 'm not doing it ! but this is awesome			0
it 's becoming one of my all - time favorites			1
" ' @entity53 ' casts actor ? ' not true ' @entity55 , " @entity56 " " @entity57 introduced it to me when we were shooting @entity60 , which took place in a beer brewery , and we had to drink so much beer			1
and you know — as @entity3 , i ca n't get too fat			1
i can get chubby , but no one 's going to believe the @entity67 stuff if @entity3 weights 240 pounds			1
so i needed to exercise more , and when she put this album [ ' @entity70 ' ] on , i just took to it right away			0
and it actually helped me jog — i would put that album to get fired up when i go running			0
@entity55 : will help fat boys get a little less chubby ! in fact , my wife and i are actually about to go run up a mountain to it later today			0
" [ @entity4 spoke to @entity0 from @entity79 , where he and his wife were on vacation			1
] she & @entity84 , " @entity82 " " i think this song 's one of the all - time greats			1
to be honest , when we first started doing the show , i did n't know @entity2 's band at all			1
but i like knowing my cast members , so i started listening to it to get a feeling for who she was			0
and man , she 's got an incredible voice			1
now that i know who she is , and it 's a year and some change later , that song 's the one that still kind of makes [ it ] in the rotation it on a weekly basis			1
" @entity108 and the @entity109 , " awake " " i know the lead guitarist , @entity110			0
he 's the director of @entity111 in @entity112			2
and actually , for my character on ' @entity9 , ' if you look at the posters , one of them is for this band			1
but @entity108 , i got into them when i was in @entity112 , and i got to see them live			0
it 's such an unbelievable live show			2
it 's one of those bands that 's always on the road			2
they 're kind of doing it old - school			2
they 're not one of those @entity8 , free download bands			0
i 'll text them asking where they are sometimes , and they 'll be like , ' a small town in @entity136 rocking out to 3 people ! ' and i 'm like , you guys are doing what , when i was growing up , i thought that bands did			0
and they 're a band that i never miss when they play in town			0
' @entity144 ' is from their original album — it 's a little political			2
it 's got a bite to it			2
" ' x-men ' : @entity151 tweets new photo @entity154 , " @entity153 " " they 're a little group i saw when i was in @entity156 a few years ago			0
they 're just super weirdo , experimental , lots of fun , kind of newish sound			2
this song 's from their first album , and it 's just kind of awesome			1
i knew one of the members from years ago			0
we 'd lost touch , and when i was in @entity156 , and i got word from another friend that this band was performing at this place in @entity173 called the @entity174			0
and they put on the craziest show — in front of a packed house , too ! " @entity179 , " we 've got tonight " " @entity179 's the best			2
if this song does n't do it for you , then you and i are from different planets			0
if this does n't get you ready for life , love , and happiness — then i do n't know who you are , @entity189			0
@entity179 to me is another guy i have a poster of on @entity3 's wall			1
the @entity193 : very underrated as well , but i could n't do both			0
i ca n't be that guy who picks both @entity179 and @entity192			0
but those were the songs of my childhood , the sounds of driving in my mom 's car , sitting in the back			2
best childhood ever , man			0
@entity179 's just one of those great @entity206 rock guys that i just feel is underrated			2
for some reason , everyone 's always talking about how @entity179 's not cool			2
those people , i ask them to get the junk out of their ears and listen , because @entity179 's cool			2
