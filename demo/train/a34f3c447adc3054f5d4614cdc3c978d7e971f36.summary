-- a beautiful 29 - year - old woman with a rare brain tumor , @entity3 and her tragic death have sparked the on - again , off - again debate about whether assisted suicide should be legalized in this country			1
the media frenzy over the @entity9 story has made it almost impossible for a legitimate opposing view to be heard , and many people believe that any opposition has to come from religious extremists or right - wing busybodies			0
as a disability rights advocate for over 40 years as well as a person living with a disability , i am deeply troubled about the @entity9 media swarm			1
assisted suicide legalization is n't about @entity3			1
it 's about the thousands of vulnerable ill , elderly and disabled people who will be harmed if assisted suicide is legalized			1
a recent report from the @entity26 calls the country 's system of caring for terminally ill people " largely broken , " " poorly designed to meet the needs of patients " and refers to @entity32 and @entity33 , health care systems designed to meet the needs of the poorest among us , " in need of major reorientation and restructuring			1
" more from opinion : why assisted suicide laws are dangerous the idea of mixing a cost - cutting " treatment " such as assisted suicide into a broken , cost - conscious health care system that 's poorly designed to meet dying patient 's needs is dangerous to the thousands of people whose health care costs the most -- mainly people living with a disability , the elderly and chronically ill. assisted suicide drugs cost less than $ 300			1
compare that with the cost of treating a terminal illness			0
this is one of the many reasons every major disability rights organization in the country that has taken a position on assisted suicide is opposed to legalization , along with the @entity67 , palliative care specialists and hospice workers who know better than anyone that advancements in palliative care have eliminated pain as an issue for patients who receive appropriate care			2
anyone dying in discomfort may legally today , in all 50 states , receive palliative sedation , wherein the patient is sedated and discomfort is relieved while the dying process takes place peacefully			0
this legal solution does not raise the very serious difficulties that legalizing assisted suicide poses			1
more from opinion : when assisted suicide is not the answer assisted suicide ultimately affects everyone 's health care			1
in @entity88 , where assisted suicide is legal and where @entity9 moved to be prescribed the lethal dose , patients have been harmed			2
in 2008 , cancer patient @entity90 was prescribed a chemotherapy treatment by her doctor , but @entity88 's state - run health plan sent a letter which denied coverage of this chemo , yet offered to cover other " treatments , " including assisted suicide			1
the same scenario happened to another @entity88 resident , @entity99			0
the @entity88 assisted suicide reports tell us that over 95 % of those who supposedly received lethal prescriptions in @entity88 had insurance , but how many got a denial like the one sent to @entity106 and @entity107 ? when assisted suicide is encouraged , it becomes a covered " treatment " and ultimately removes choices from patients			1
assisted suicide 's supposed " safeguards " are hollow			2
nothing in the @entity88 , @entity114 and @entity115 laws prevents an heir or caregiver from suggesting assisted suicide as an option , taking the person to the doctor to sign up and witnessing the consent form			2
once the prescription is obtained , with no further witness required , nothing in the law ensures the person 's consent or self - administration at the time of death			0
more from opinion : @entity9 was courageous and right with the rising tide of elder abuse in this country , we ca n't ignore the dangers of granting blanket legal immunity to all the participants in an assisted suicide			2
when voters are given all the facts surrounding assisted suicide , they reject bills to legalize it			0
this was the case in @entity146 when @entity147 2 , which would have legalized assisted suicide in the @entity146 , was on the ballot in 2012 but was defeated			0
in 2014 , bills again in @entity146 , @entity150 and @entity151 failed because of lack of support in the legislature			0
@entity3 's story is incredibly heart - wrenching			0
when you look at assisted suicide based on one individual , it often looks acceptable			0
but when you examine how legalization affects the vast majority of us -- especially those most vulnerable -- the dangers to the many far outweigh any alleged benefits to a few .			0

@entity169 : i am deeply troubled about the @entity3 media swarm
@entity173 : legalizing assisted suicide would harm the chronically ill , elderly or disabled
she says mixing a cost - cutting " treatment " into our broken health care system is a *bad* idea
@entity173 : if assisted suicide is encouraged , it may well take choices away from patients
