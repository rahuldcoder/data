attorney general @entity0 is spending his remaining time in office as an activist for civil rights and social justice issues , ranging from gay rights to changing sentencing laws for non-violent crimes			1
if all goes as planned , it could help change his legacy			2
the key mile - marker in @entity0 's five - year tenure is president @entity14 's february 2011 decision -- with @entity0 's recommendation -- to quit legally defending the @entity18 - era @entity16			1
the law required the federal government to deny recognition of same - sex marriages			1
that decision , which came at a time when the president said he was still " evolving " on whether to support such marriages , eventually led to the @entity27 's ruling last year that overturned the law			2
and it led to @entity0 's announcement in recent weeks to extend spousal benefits to same - sex married couples in all federal legal matters			1
is same - sex marriage no longer a political issue ? for @entity0 , 63 , it 's a way to carve out a modern civil rights legacy			1
in discussing his gay - rights efforts , he often mentions his sister - in - law , who in 1963 made history as one of the two black students who integrated the @entity44 under federal armed guard			2
a portrait of a @entity48 prosecutor who stood watch on the university steps that day hangs in @entity0 's personal office in a fifth - floor corner of the @entity48 headquarters named for @entity54			0
@entity0 and his supporters have eagerly embraced the @entity54 legacy as a comparison			0
" when you look at his entire record , @entity0 will have done more to expand justice in the @entity64 than any attorney general since @entity54 , " says @entity58 , a former aide to @entity0 who remains close to the attorney general			1
it 's not the way his critics have portrayed him , particularly during some of the rocky periods of his tenure			0
for a time , he was involved in fights with @entity73 and @entity75 rivals over a variety of national security issues			0
and he survived a bruising battle with @entity75 @entity73 over the " @entity80 " gun trafficking controversy , including becoming the first sitting @entity82 member to be held in contempt of @entity84			0
" i 've had some days that have been better than others , " @entity0 told @entity85 in a november interview			0
but added that now , " there 's the ability to focus on issues now that really matter to me			0
" among those issues is working to change sentencing guidelines to give prosecutors more flexibility in certain non-violent criminal cases , pushing for rehabilitation instead of warehousing of prisoners , and getting rid of the disparity in the way the justice system deals with defendants charged in cocaine and crack cocaine crimes			1
@entity0 also recently made a public push for states to more quickly restore voting rights to felons after they 've completed their sentences and probation			1
he is joined in that effort by sen. @entity112 and other conservatives who 've similarly view it in line with their views on expanded individual rights			0
@entity112 fights for felon voting rights following @entity0 's plea , @entity120 's @entity73 governor said he could support such an idea , and a modified proposal in @entity112 's home state of @entity125 has begun moving through the legislature			1
but @entity0 's moves to use administrative memos to make effective changes before @entity84 passes new laws have also generated criticism			0
former attorney general @entity132 told @entity85 's @entity133 in an august interview that " i generally agree with the goal of getting rid of mandatory minimums			2
... but the way to do that is to pass a law , not to say you 're going to disregard the law			0
" sen. @entity142 similarly has criticized @entity0 and the @entity14 administration for taking action without waiting for @entity84			0
but the department 's decision to not defend the federal ban on same - sex marriage has since become emulated in states , including @entity150 and @entity151			1
those moves could propel the issue back to the @entity27 in the next two years			0
@entity0 's most aggressive moves have come in recent weeks with an aggressive interpretation of last year 's @entity27 ruling on same - sex marriage			1
after much internal debate , @entity0 decided the department would give full equal treatment to same - sex married couples , going so far as extending the right to refuse to provide incriminating testimony against a spouse , a bedrock right for married couples			2
earlier this month , @entity0 basked in applause in a @entity169 hotel ballroom where he announced the department 's latest decision on same - same marriage legal rights			2
the @entity174 , which held the event , praised him , by saying the decision " cements his place in history alongside @entity54 , another attorney general who crusaded for civil rights			1

attorney general aggressively pushing civil rights and social justice issues
the move could help change his legacy as @entity14 's top law *enforcement* official
same - sex marriage , sentencing guidelines , voting rights for felons are key issues
