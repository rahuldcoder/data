-- the images coming out of @entity2 since a devastating earthquake rocked the country almost a year ago show death , disease and political uncertainty			1
yet these images do n't portray the whole story			0
ten - year - old @entity9 , who lost her relatives and home in the quake , recently returned to school , proudly wearing her new pink uniform			1
she boasts to @entity16 staff that she is one of the best students in class			0
she dreams of becoming a doctor			0
@entity9 is one example of what is possible for children who live in a country that for decades has been mired in poverty and corruption			2
today , @entity2 is at a crossroads and the future of these children will be determined by their families , countrymen , newly elected government , and , the international community			2
will we limit relief efforts to achieve no more than a return to the status quo , or will we make children like @entity9 the priority -- and transform tragedy into sustainable progress led by @entity2 ? clearly , the latter is the only way to realize the promise of @entity2 's next generation			1
i urge @entity2 -- with support of the international community -- to achieve a prompt , fair and credible resolution of the election			1
this would guarantee that lifesaving cholera work can continue uninterrupted so the newly elected government will provide the leadership so @entity2 can take advantage of a constellation of factors that hold potential for success			1
these include : -- the opportunities presented by unprecedented attention , resources and international partnerships focused on @entity2 , -- the incredible resiliency of the @entity2 people who prefer a hand up to a handout , -- the resourcefulness of @entity2 living abroad who are committed to @entity2 's future , -- @entity2 's proximity to the @entity72 , which has a strong national interest in seeing the country progress			1
as its next - door neighbor , the @entity72 must assist the @entity2 people in their quest to build back			1
@entity77 and the @entity79 administration need to make a 15 - year commitment to @entity2 that will help create sustainable development to improve the health , education and economic opportunities of children and families			1
the @entity72 must also work with other donors to treat those who are suffering from cholera and invest in water and sanitation programs that will eliminate the conditions in which cholera thrives			1
a long - term investment is not only the right thing to do , but the smart thing to do			0
a @entity2 that is not developed is far more costly to the @entity72 than one that is economically and politically secure			1
investing in a more resilient @entity2 now will yield significant return			2
it will cost far less than a continuing cycle of poverty , disaster recovery , and instability which @entity72 interests in our hemisphere will require us to address when they reach an emergency level			2
with the right commitments by @entity2 and international leadership , @entity9 has a chance to become a doctor			1
her mother has a chance to be trained in a profession that will contribute to the economic growth of their community and country			0
their family can someday move from a camp to a house that is accessible to health care services , schools and jobs			0
small steps can create a ripple effect and lead to big , positive and lasting changes			0
one only needs to look across the border to the @entity132 to see how long - term @entity72 investments have contributed to a strong stable government and economy			2
forty years ago , the @entity132 had some areas that were as undeveloped as @entity2			1
today , it has hospitals , universities and a thriving tourism industry			0
@entity2 has the potential to move in this direction			2
already @entity2 has seen progress since the earthquake , albeit at a much slower pace than many of us would like , given the obstacles it faced before and after the earthquake			2
nevertheless , gains are being made			0
despite the untenable living conditions and lack of jobs and basic services , many children are back in school			0
many families living in camps now have access to clean water , which they did not have before the earthquake			0
pregnant and new mothers who never had access to health facilities are seeing doctors , nurses and midwives			0
most of this success can be attributed to the generous outpouring from the international community in the immediate aftermath of the quake and to many of the @entity2 in the @entity72 and @entity175 who have returned to help create a better future for their homeland			1
we should not give up on the opportunity to make @entity2 better			0
with coordinated leadership from the government of @entity2 , backed by perseverance and leadership from the @entity72 and international community , @entity2 can help ensure @entity9 -- and all the children of @entity2 -- have the chance to realize their full potential so that they and their country may prosper			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0
