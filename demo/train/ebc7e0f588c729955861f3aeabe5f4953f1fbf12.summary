@entity0 , @entity1 -- flowers , teddy bears and candles mark the spot wednesday where a gunman tossed grenades into a crowded @entity0 market square a day before , claiming several lives and wounding scores more			1
the mood in @entity13 , a square which would normally be bustling with @entity15 shoppers , was somber wednesday as @entity1 took stock of an attack unprecedented in their history			0
workers at the @entity15 market opened up their stalls , housed in wooden cabins , but trade was slow			0
one woman said they had been told they could start trading later , if they wanted first to pay tribute to the five people killed and 130 wounded before the attacker , @entity0 resident @entity25 , apparently took his own life			1
market stall holder @entity34 was still shaking as she talked about tuesday 's attack , calling it " horrible " and comparing its effect on the peaceful country to that of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity43			1
other people in the city said that @entity15 would not be the same and that they could not understand why the attack occurred			0
officials say @entity25 , 33 , who had no record of mental illness , hurled his three grenades and fired a pistol and semi-automatic weapon from an elevated walkway above a bus stop in the square			1
the attack seemed to have left the city 's people with a new sense of vulnerability , with those waiting for buses wednesday standing back under the walkway , as if to protect themselves from another aerial assault			2
chunks missing from a granite wall testified to the ferocity of the grenade blasts , with bullet holes also pocking the hard surface			0
one mother who was a few yards away from the gunman when he opened fire said she now feared for the safety of her children			2
another recounted how her children had left school early and passed through the bus stop only shortly before it was attacked , narrowly avoiding the tragedy			0
in a restaurant , near - silence replaced the usual hubbub , as people appeared to withdraw into themselves , reflecting on the tragedy just a day earlier			0
so far , public anger over the attack seems limited			0
few questions have yet been asked about how a man convicted of weapons offenses was able to get his hands on guns and grenades			2
the owner of one of the city 's two main gun stores , which appeared to stock dozens of automatic - style weapons , said he knew @entity25 but refused to answer further questions			1
police are investigating whether @entity25 bought the weapons used in the attack on the black market , said @entity104 , spokeswoman for the provincial governor 's office			1
she said @entity25 , who held a @entity108 hunting license under which he bought at least one firearm before his 2008 conviction , was skilled in using and maintaining weapons			2
a woman , said to be a cleaner in her late 40s , was found dead in a residence next to a workshop where @entity25 once grew marijuana , local police said			1
but he seems to have kept a relatively low profile in the area			0
neighbors of @entity25 who spoke to @entity2 said they had seldom seen him around			1
one man said he had realized @entity25 was a neighbor only after recognizing his picture in a newspaper			2
@entity25 , a @entity1 citizen , had been released from prison on conditional parole in october 2010 but returned to the attention of police in november this year			1
he had been asked to attend a police interview on the day of the attack in connection with allegations of sexual offenses , the @entity0 prosecutor said			1
so far , public scrutiny has not yet turned to why he was not arrested and brought in for questioning , given his track record			0
but as the city 's shock fades and investigations continue into what led him to launch his deadly gun and grenade rampage , such questions will likely come to the forefront			0
@entity2 's @entity145 contributed to this report .			0

residents of @entity0 say they are shocked by the attack and fear for their children 's safety
the motivation of attacker @entity25 , 33 , is not known , police say
neighbors say they saw little of the *suspect* , who lived in @entity0
@entity25 , *previously* convicted of arms offenses , was known to a local gun store owner
