-- @entity3 back in the winter of 1982 , i was a fifth grader at @entity4 -- and i was not happy			2
because it was late in the year , and because i lived in a town , @entity7 , @entity8 , with about six - and - a - half @entity9 , i was required by law to participate in the school 's annual holiday concert			1
it was , for a boy who always felt resentful over having to spend december 25 inside @entity16 's @entity15 , the worst of the worst of the worst			2
of the 11 songs we were told to sing , 10 were @entity20 carols			1
of those 10 , seven or eight evoked either @entity21 or the @entity22 or @entity21 and the @entity22			1
finally fed up , one day i swallowed my anxiety and approached mrs. @entity24 , our fifth - grade teacher -- a woman who scared the living hell out of me			1
@entity27 : " ms. @entity24 , i have a complaint			1
" ms. @entity24 : " what do you want ? " @entity27 : " i 'm @entity9			1
" ms. @entity24 : " so ? " @entity27 : " i do n't think it 's fair that there are no @entity33 songs in the concert			1
" ms. @entity24 : " do n't be stupid			2
i put on my stupid white collared shirt and my stupid red tie , and when the special night arrived i crooned loud and proud about the miracle of @entity21 's birth			1
ok , admittedly i stood there and opened my mouth a few times while gazing longingly toward @entity43			0
later that evening , i told my father that i would never engage in such an endeavor again			0
" why ? " he said			0
" what 's the big deal ? " i was stunned			2
" it is a big deal , " i said , " because these people act like @entity33 does n't even exist			2
it 's all @entity20 , all the time , and we get no equal treatment whatsoever			1
" " you 're right , " @entity54 said , " and it 's an absolute blessing			1
" it took me several years to grasp my father 's thinking but , with 41 decembers now under my belt , i agree 100 % with his take : there 's no better time to be @entity9 than december			1
i know ... i know			0
@entity20 is sooooo - o - o awesome			1
presents ! ham ! a tree ! more presents ! as a @entity9 boy in a @entity67 town , i heard these paeans over and over and over , and i even used to believe them			1
why , oh why , could n't we celebrate , too ? then , one christmas eve @entity54 took me into the city to observe the madness			1
we entered @entity74 's ( ground zero for 1980s holiday madness ) with nary a care in the world , kicked back and soaked in the insanity			1
there were people fighting over the last @entity82 and @entity81 ; folks nervously gazing down at their crumpled lists -- contained in their faces the looming stress of the emptying wallet , of the materialistic mayhem , of the pure , unadulterated holiday hell			2
" does this look fun to you ? " @entity54 asked			1
" um , no , " i said			0
" " is this what you want @entity33 to be ? " " no , " i said			0
" we returned home , lit the menorah , belted out our off - tune rendition of " @entity101 " and exchanged the regular sixth - or seventh - night gift			0
my father is a quirky guy : a @entity107 - born jew who spent his childhood attending hebrew school and avoiding bacon			2
if anyone has pride in his religion , it 's @entity115			2
and yet , @entity54 never seemed to mind @entity116 in all its @entity20 splendor , or carolers standing at the front door , or the inane school concert			1
i 'd moan and complain and cry , and he refused to flinch			0
his stance was a simple - yet-wise one : enjoy it			2
take an evening drive to see all the lights			0
buy eggnog at the supermarket			0
walk into @entity129 's house and smell the pine needles			0
study the ornaments , suck on a candy cane			0
" i love @entity20 , " @entity54 has said myriad times , " because it 's not my holiday			1
there 's no stress or pressure			0
you can embrace it without having to own it			0
" hence , this past friday i took my daughter @entity143 out of school for our annual @entity8 fun day			0
we roamed through @entity147 and the @entity148 , watched the @entity150 puppet show , walked past @entity152 's village			0
the decorations were nice and the lights , while blinding , were pretty			0
but everything was overcrowded and excessively hyped			0
" this , " @entity143 said to me , " is pretty crazy			0
" " no , " i replied			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			1

@entity163 lived in a town with few @entity9 , and had to sing in the school 's holiday concert
the @entity20 carols evoked either @entity21 or the @entity22 or @entity21 and the @entity22
" @entity27 " complained to his teacher and @entity54 that @entity20 and concert were n't fair
his dad said enjoy it , take in the lights , and be happy you do n't have to experience the anxiety
