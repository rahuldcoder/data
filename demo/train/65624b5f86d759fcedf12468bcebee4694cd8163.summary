-- seeking to alleviate concern about rising oil prices , @entity3 's oil minister said his country and other @entity8 members have the capacity to produce surplus oil , @entity1 reported			1
@entity3 alone has a surplus of about 4 million barrels per day , the agency quoted minister @entity14 as saying			1
it was not clear from the news agency 's report whether @entity14 meant that @entity3 is already producing an extra 4 million barrels or that it can , if the need arises			2
on tuesday , 87 countries -- including @entity3 -- signed a charter to limit price fluctuations and stabilize the market			1
the move came as oil prices jumped 6 %			1
prices spiked as high as $ 98 a barrel earlier in the session , as the crisis in @entity30 sparked concern that the turmoil roiling the @entity33 could spread to other producing countries -- including @entity3			2
" now it 's starting to look like the entire region 's on fire , and it looks like it could spread to other parts of the region , " said @entity35 , oil analyst with energy risk management firm @entity37			0
" this thing is getting worse and worse and worse , and it could spread to @entity3 , and that 's the big fear			0
" @entity30 's importance with regard to oil prices does n't hinge so much on its oil - producing and exporting capabilities , said @entity35			2
to put things in perspective , @entity30 produces about 1.6 million barrels of crude per day , compared with @entity3 's daily production of 8.4 million barrels and worldwide production of 87 million barrels , he said			1
but now the monarchy of @entity3 , one of the @entity62 ' strongest allies and an island of stability in an otherwise tempestuous region , faces an uncertain future			0
