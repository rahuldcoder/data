-- now that the urgent business of the government shutdown and the debt ceiling is over , it is a good time for @entity5 to stop and think			1
below is an excerpt from the strategy memo i shared with @entity10 republicans wednesday morning on the situation currently facing the @entity5			1
i believe that with the right approach and an emphasis on a better future for all @entity16 , we can win and govern in 2014 , 2016 , and beyond , but that it will take some profound rethinking of how to make our case to the @entity16 people			2
the current situation the left , broadly speaking -- president @entity26 , most of the news media , left - wing interest groups , @entity24 -- believes it sees an opportunity to create a wave election similar to those of 1994 , 2006 , 2010 and retake majority control of the @entity10			1
their goal is to describe the @entity5 as an unacceptably radical party and defeat individual candidates by suppressing @entity5 turnout , driving independents away from @entity5 and maximizing turnout of the @entity24 base			1
in particular , efforts to control spending in @entity41 and @entity42 and to reduce or eliminate funding for left - wing activities will consistently be described as radical and unacceptable			2
reading the polls after the recent government shutdown , the left believes ( mistakenly , i think ) that this model is now even more likely to succeed			0
those same polls also reveal extraordinary opportunity for @entity5			1
the fact is that @entity16 are fed up with @entity53 , not just with @entity5			2
they believe @entity16 is on the wrong track , and @entity26 's approval rating is now among lowest of his presidency			0
while @entity5 are currently on defense , the failures and costs of @entity60 , the continuing weak economy in jobs and take - home pay , growing government debt , and inevitable failures of bureaucratic big government will only make it more obvious that @entity53 and the bureaucracy is hopelessly broken			1
and the @entity24 have very publicly reaffirmed themselves as the party of big government bureaucracy , most recently with the launch of @entity60			1
republicans could respond to these failures of government by becoming the @entity74			2
but the @entity74 can rapidly reduce its supporters as people are told what the austerity means for them personally			0
policies of pain almost never work in the absence of a large crisis			0
they might also play into the @entity85 caricature of @entity5 as radical and unacceptable			0
there is a different strategy , however , which could dramatically unlock the current policy gridlock in @entity53 and create a new conversation in which @entity16 find the @entity5 to once again be the party of hope and opportunity ( as it was in the @entity94 years and in the 1994 contract with @entity16 campaign )			1
@entity5 : website woes create fresh opening to go after @entity60 an historic opportunity the dramatic breakthroughs in science , technology , and entrepreneurship are creating new policy opportunities for a better future with a better economy , more take - home pay , better health , more learning , greater national security , a better , smaller , modernized government , and a balanced federal budget			1
in @entity53 insider terms , this sounds like a fantasy or an impossibility			0
in the dynamic world outside @entity53 , all of these capabilities are increasingly obvious but outside the political news media , the political language , and the thinking of politicians and their staffs and their consultants			0
this historic opportunity requires a very substantial change in the thinking and behavior of @entity5 , and there will be enormous resistance to the change			1
a key @entity5 goal should be to have 80 % of all communications for the next four years be positive -- about exciting breakthroughs , exciting opportunities , and a better future for virtually all @entity16			1
nothing would do more to defeat the left 's current strategy than a positive @entity5 focused on opportunities for the future			1
opinion : immigration reform would help @entity5 offering @entity16 a better future our premise is that new science , technology , and entrepreneurship can lead to : a rapidly growing economy with more jobs , more take - home pay and more economic opportunity ; a new system of better learning at lower cost for your entire lifetime ; a dramatic improvement in health outcomes and reduced costs leading to longer lives , greater independence for the elderly , and a dramatic increase in high - value jobs marketing @entity16 health innovations throughout the world ; a modernized government that is much less expensive , more effective , and more reliable and accountable ; a better environment through sound science , entrepreneurship , and focused problem - solving ; a stronger , leaner , less wasteful national security system ; a balanced budget within a decade through a combination of : -- greater economic growth ; -- more government revenues from a larger economy and from royalties from energy and other natural resources ; -- dramatic modernization of government to reduce waste and eliminate fraud ; -- breakthroughs in health dramatically lowering the cost of health care ; -- returning power to the states and to the people			1
opinion : 3 ways to avert @entity53 's next disaster @entity195 strategy @entity5 in the @entity195 should focus first on economic growth , second on increased revenue through increased energy royalties , third on modernizing government to reduce fraud and theft , and fourth on dramatic opportunities for better health outcomes at lower costs			2
a tax increase for entitlement cuts agreement is a pain - pain agreement and ca n't possibly achieve our goals or be supported by the @entity16 people			0
there is no democracy in our lifetime that has sustained an austerity - led reform program			0
we need a new model of budget breakthroughs and this formula creates a new focus on a positive , opportunity - oriented future			0
what we are proposing is to replace the argument of more versus less with an argument of better future versus failed present			0
today we have republicans who want more savings and less taxes versus @entity24 who want less savings and more taxes			2
neither side is arguing for rethinking the fundamentals , learning from non-washington developments , and modernizing government systems and policies			0
better future vs. failed present would be a profound change in the very nature of the national debate			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			0

@entity243 : @entity24 see an opportunity to win back control of the @entity10
he says @entity5 will be painted as *opponents* of entitlement programs
@entity252 : @entity5 should n't look for a deal to rein in entitlement spending and raise taxes
@entity252 : @entity257 should be a future of innovation in contrast to past government failures
