-- with flights to @entity2 topping $ 1,000 these days , travel to @entity3 can be très cher			1
but you need n't cross the pond for that @entity6			0
here are five enclaves in @entity8 where @entity10 culture thrives : @entity11 , @entity12 settled by @entity10 fur traders and later captured by the @entity14 , @entity11 grew into a bilingual city with dual identities			1
and while myriad other tonguesare spoken thanks to a thriving immigrant population , it remains the second - largest @entity22 city in the world after @entity2			1
you 'll hear bonjours and ca vas in every borough , but the most solidly @entity10 neighborhoods are east of @entity29 -- the de facto border that separates it from the largely @entity32 - speaking west side			1
linger over an espresso at one of the terrasses ( patios ) that line @entity38 in the @entity39			0
then head to the vaunted @entity40 , a classic @entity2 bistro in @entity42 , where everything from the zinc bar to the tight quarters to the duck confit will spark flashbacks of @entity48			2
go for : the @entity49 is a festival celebrating @entity22 music with some 250 live acts			0
@entity52 , @entity12 founded by @entity10 explorer @entity53 more than 400 years ago , @entity52 , like @entity11 , fell to the @entity14 crown a century and a half later			1
its @entity57 culture , however , remained firmly intact			0
today , nearly 95 % of the residents are native @entity10 speakers			1
the city 's gabled roofs , winding streets and ramparts conjure an @entity65 feel			0
@entity12 ( @entity66 ) is the only fortified city in @entity8 north of @entity67			0
get the full scoop on @entity12 's @entity10 heritage at the @entity70 , where a new exhibition tells the story of @entity22 who pulled up stakes to settle in @entity8 with interactive features such as a hallway meant to evoke a departure dock			2
around the corner , the cozy @entity80 , with its exposed brick walls and roaring hearth fire , serves up the kind of rustic fare you find in the @entity10 countryside , such as cassoulet ( a one - pot dish of white beans and meat such as pork sausage and duck confit ) and boudin noir ( blood sausage )			1
go for : quebecois celebrate the arrival of their ancestors in @entity97 at the @entity3 festival			1
@entity99 , @entity100 claimed by @entity3 as part of the @entity102 in 1682 , @entity99 rose from a swamp on the bend of the @entity105 to become a strategic port city			1
named for the @entity107 of @entity3 , @entity108 , @entity109 , the original town developed around what is now known as @entity112			2
after the @entity115 in 1803 , a mix of nationalities flooded the city , creating the unique @entity10 / @entity118 - infused melting pot that is the @entity99 today			1
nonetheless , remnants of its @entity10 heritage are evident throughout			2
for one , snacking on beignets and café au lait at the venerable @entity123 in the @entity124 is as de rigueur for tourists as taking home @entity128 beads			0
history buffs who ca n't make it to the @entity133 to see one of @entity136 's famous marble bathtubs -- he supposedly signed the @entity115 while in the tub -- can book @entity138 at the 100 - year - old @entity139 , near the @entity124 , to take a plunge in one said to have been owned by @entity136 ( there are three total )			0
a short walk away on @entity142 , the @entity143 , a bed and breakfast and former home of artist @entity147 , hosts " @entity155 " evenings , where amateur artists can drink wine , paint and soak up the atmosphere in the studio of the @entity10 @entity154 master			2
go for : in a nod to @entity99 ' @entity57 roots , @entity10 statesman @entity156 gave the city a @entity162 statue , an exact replica of one that stands in @entity99 , which today presides over the @entity165 and is feted annually with a parade			1
@entity167 and @entity168 , @entity10 territory a remnant of @entity3 's exploits in @entity97 , these rocky islands some 15 miles off the coast of @entity172 were deeded to the republic in 1816 under the second @entity176 after a century - long tussle with @entity32			1
settlers eager to work in the islands ' rich cod fishery came from @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 in @entity3 and the @entity184 , which includes parts of @entity186 and @entity3			1
another boom came during @entity188 , when smuggling spirits to the @entity190 made some islanders rich			0
today , the archipelago -- a " territorial collectivity " of @entity3 -- retains much of the character of its mother country			2
most merchants close up shop at midday to lunch with their families at home			0
the baguettes and croissants are the real deal			0
the euro is the currency of the land , though many businesses accept @entity97 and @entity190 dollars			2
you 'll find the most action on the tiniest and most populated island , @entity167			2
with its colorful clapboard houses , narrow streets , classic cafes and @entity216 zipping around , it 's @entity217 - meets - @entity183			0
join the locals as they break for la collation , a light meal , in the late afternoon ; duck into @entity223 on @entity224 for a spot of @entity221 tea and a @entity2 - worthy pastry			1
go for : @entity228 , the anniversary of the storming of the infamous prison in @entity2 in 1789 , is celebrated at @entity231 in @entity232			0
@entity233 , @entity100 expelled by the @entity14 from what are now the @entity97 maritime provinces and northern @entity237 during the @entity238 ( 1754 - 1763 ) , many @entity234 settled in south @entity100 , spawning a rich culture and their own dialect , @entity10 , that is still very much alive today			1
in some pockets , such as the small town of @entity244 , @entity10 rules -- on street signs , in radio broadcasts , political ads and even as the sole language of some residents			1
at the @entity251 and @entity252 in @entity253 , a replica of an @entity234 village depicts life circa 1765 - 1890			0
for a modern taste of @entity10 life , landmark @entity253 restaurants @entity257 's and @entity259 's host live @entity10 music and specialize in local favorites such as crawfish étouffée			0
go for : unlike the glittery spectacle in @entity99 , @entity128 in @entity233 has changed little since its early days			0
revelers on horseback dress up in costumes made from flour sacks or burlap , and ride from house to house collecting ingredients -- including live chickens -- for a communal pot of gumbo			0

@entity11 is the second - largest city of @entity10 - speaking natives in the world after @entity2
the rocky islands of @entity167 and @entity168 off the coast of @entity97 are still part of @entity3
@entity10 is the first language of some residents of @entity233 in @entity100
