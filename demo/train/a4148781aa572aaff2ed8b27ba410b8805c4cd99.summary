@entity0 , -- the guard wearing a @entity5 t - shirt paces nervously in front of the heavy , blue steel door , his pump - action shotgun held tightly in his right hand			1
he presses his finger against the trigger when anyone bangs loudly on the metal to enter the @entity13 in downtown @entity0 , pulling the door slowly open and gingerly peering his head out to see who it is			2
usually they are met with a firm volley of abuse in @entity21 , but this time it is the guests he has been expecting			2
the @entity26 national football team bus has arrived for training the day before one of the most important matches in the team 's history : a @entity32 qualifier against the minnows of the @entity34			1
it is also the country 's first home football match since as many as 300,000 people were killed when a massive 7.0 earthquake reduced much of the city to rubble			1
" it 's 46 degrees on the pitch , we just measured it , " lamented the team 's @entity43 coach @entity42			1
it is three in the afternoon , the same time the match is due to be played 24 - hours later			1
@entity51 [ football 's world governing body ] agreed to move the match to this time			1
@entity54 [ the governing body for the @entity56 ] said no. what do they know ? they work out of @entity59 and know nothing about the heat in the @entity56			2
" but the change in time was a necessity as much for the @entity26 as anyone else			1
electricity is scarce in the city , too scarce for the expensive but impotent flood lights that had been installed			2
soccer salvation : how @entity26 is healing after its earthquake @entity26 football , like virtually every aspect of @entity26 society , was almost terminally injured when the earthquake hit in january 2010			1
the @entity5 's headquarters were leveled , killing more than 30 of its staff			1
its president , @entity77 , was one of only two survivors			2
the stadium itself had become , like any other scrap of spare space in @entity0 , a makeshift camp			2
hundreds of families lived here until being moved out in july when a new pitch was laid			2
a torn blue ribbon of despair still surrounds it			2
workers busily paint the steps inside blue , yellow and red -- the colors of the @entity26 flag -- to erase the memory of its temporary incarnation			1
the smell is of paint , excrement from the nearby open sewers and burning trash			2
the @entity5 president , knowing that the game has such a place in @entity26 's heart , went on to rebuild the federation and hired @entity42 to achieve the dream of emulating @entity26 's golden generation who qualified for the 1974 @entity32			1
" my first impression was to take my flight back to @entity43 , " @entity42 explains a few hours before traveling to the stadium			2
" the country was completely devastated			2
today is a paradise compared			0
if you compare with last year ... you could be walking the street and find the [ severed ] legs of people , the arms of people			1
" @entity42 began by paying for his own flight to @entity123 , where he hired a car and visited the professional players of @entity26 descent who play on the continent			1
" i rented a car to travel to five countries to persuade the players to play for his original country			0
most of them do n't speak @entity21			0
" the squad for the @entity34 ' game was full of talented new professionals gleaned from the diaspora , like @entity145 who is on @entity147 's books and goalkeeper @entity148 , a @entity59 born and raised who plays for the @entity150			2
" i was in college when i heard a buzz about @entity26 being interested in seeing me , " explains @entity148 , whose grandmother used to be a baker for the former president @entity153			1
soccer storm in the @entity56 : how diplomacy faltered over football " coming here left me speechless			0
the fans come after training , before training , crowding around the bus			0
my passion for soccer has always been there and i always wished that the people around me shared that passion			2
for the first time i found the passion i 've been looking for			0
" yet sometimes passion is n't enough and @entity42 hopes that the professionalism of his new team will rub off on the local players , who he believes are some of the most talented in the world			0
" i have never seen a country with so many talents as here , " he says			0
" if you put these guys in @entity184 and @entity185 , they would be great player [ s ]			0
the problem is to be a great player you need good food and a good environment			0
" on the morning of the match the country 's president @entity194 , a former singer known as " @entity194 " , arrives to meet the players			1
he shakes each by the hand , presents them with a flag and sings the national anthem together			0
" i believe there 's a new movement			2
there 's a new will to show a new face of @entity26 , " he says			1
" @entity26 is ready to show that new face			1
in the past we talk about our problems and issues			0
but today is a chance to prove that today @entity26 can be a great nation and can be victorious			1
i could n't express in words what @entity26 would be like if ... when , not if , we qualify for the @entity32 in @entity43			1
" as kick off approaches 10,000 @entity26 , maybe more , try and fail to crush through the single open door into the stadium at the same time			1
a police blockade had been thrown around the stadium			0
creole rap music is played at ear - splitting level			0
the crowd push forward in the hope of getting in , the police use shields and clubs to beat them back			0
it 's chaos , but such is the passion for football in @entity26 , that a match against a tiny team like the @entity34 brings the country to a standstill			1
" i am very happy , we will have our victory			0
this will be a victory for all of @entity26 , " explains @entity233 , a 28 - year - old engineer and translator waiting in line behind the crowd , which had by now threatened to get out of control			1
but then the rain comes , just in time to dampen the anger as the fans run to take cover			0
" life is very hard here , " @entity233 adds			0
" with @entity248 everything is possible			0
but this is the reason why football can change something			0
i hope @entity26 scores ten goals			1
" @entity26 tear the @entity34 apart			1
six goals are scored , the post is hit three times , sending the crowd delirious			0
@entity148 is a virtual spectator until the final whistle			0
" i did touch the ball once , " he says with a wink as he comes off the pitch			0
" but not with my hands			0
" there is a long way to go			0
on tuesday they play @entity267			0
next , perhaps @entity269 or @entity270 or the dream ticket : @entity271			1
but , for now , @entity272 brought something to @entity26 that has been in short supply for so long : hope			1
" i feel so happy to see what happened in the country and to see all the @entity26 come to the game			1
it was incredible , " says @entity279 , the @entity280 player who scored in the rout			0
" we only have one thing left , and that 's football			2
you can play and all the world is watching you			0
the flag can fly everywhere because of football			0
it 's the one thing that people live for now			1
