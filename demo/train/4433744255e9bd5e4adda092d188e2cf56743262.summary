a bad week for @entity2 football continued on wednesday when world governing body @entity3 announced it will not compensate clubs if the @entity5 is moved to november - december			1
on tuesday , @entity6 , the chairman of the @entity7 , said his organization 's members wanted financial compensation following the proposed change			2
this was to cover the costs that @entity15 's clubs and leagues will spend on rescheduling their championships , many of which run between august and may			0
but @entity3 secretary general @entity20 dashed those hopes when speaking in @entity22 , the country that will host the 2022 finals			1
" there will be no compensation			0
i mean , they have seven years to reorganize football around the world for this @entity5 , " the @entity26 told reporters			1
" it is happening once and we are doing nothing that destroys football , " he added			0
with concerns for both players and fans given the @entity22 heat in june - july , a @entity3 task force announced on tuesday that the tournament should be played at the end of the year			1
average temperatures in @entity22 are around 25 degrees @entity42 towards the end of the year , roughly 15 degrees lower than the traditional @entity5 months			2
@entity20 also said the duration of the competition would be reduced from 32 to 28 days			0
@entity3 is expected to ratify the proposals when its @entity46 meets in @entity47 on 19 - 20 march			0
@entity2 clubs had been hoping for the tournament to be played at the start of 2022			1
" @entity15 and its @entity53 had initially preferred for the @entity5 to be held in january , " the @entity2 governing body said in a statement			2
" however , once the @entity54 recommended to stage the competition from late november to late december 2022 , @entity15 suggested an option could be for the final to be played on december 23			0
" the @entity58 , whose chief executive @entity59 said he was " very disappointed " by the switch , would prefer the final to be played earlier in order to maintain its traditional @entity65 calendar , with matches having been played on december 26 for many decades			0
meanwhile , @entity20 suggested that the @entity67 , which normally takes place between january and february , will kick off in june because of the delay to the @entity5			1
the @entity70 has yet to comment on the matter , having previously stated it will only readjust its calendar once @entity3 has confirmed the dates for the @entity22 tournament			0
in an unexpected move , @entity3 announced that the @entity76 will not be held in @entity22			2
the tournament is often described as a @entity5 warm - up given that it allows the host nation to fine tune its facilities and conduct a test run some 12 months before the main event			1
@entity20 said the climate rules out @entity22 and added that the tournament , which pits the @entity5 holders against the hosts and champions of @entity3 's six confederations , will be played " in an @entity88 country , " which has still to be determined .			1

@entity3 states that @entity2 clubs will not receive any compensation following the proposal to play the @entity5 in november - december .
secretary general @entity20 says financial compensation is not necessary given that clubs have seven years ' to reorganize '
@entity26 says @entity22 will not host the @entity76 , often labeled the @entity5 warm - up , in 2021
@entity67 will be played in june , adds @entity20
