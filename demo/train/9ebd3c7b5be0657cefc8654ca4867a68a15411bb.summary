-- i see your million - man march and raise you another million			1
that 's the game the @entity6 and opposition parties were playing in @entity7 this week			1
after president @entity10 granted himself sweeping new temporary emergency powers , his opponents vowed to send a million protestors to the streets yesterday			2
@entity10 's supporters responded by announcing their own equally massive gathering			0
fortunately , cooler heads prevailed , and a deal was struck between @entity18 and @entity7 's judges , who had threatened a countrywide strike			1
but too often , the " winner - takes - all " @entity23 model persists in @entity7 politics			1
instead of engaging or working within the system , and compromising , opposition forces protest in @entity27 or boycott			1
while these tactics won a revolution , they will not build a democracy			0
@entity10 's government won worldwide acclaim last week when it achieved two enormously impressive victories ( albeit with no input from the so - called secular liberal parties ) : a ceasefire in @entity39 and a commitment of $ 4.8 billion from the @entity41 , with billions from the @entity42 to follow			2
news : fresh clashes in @entity45 over @entity10 decree but a day later , claiming that the work product of the country 's 100 - member @entity48 could be jeopardized , @entity10 suspended the ability of the independent court system to review or block the draft constitution , which is due to be released in less than two weeks			1
a plebiscite is to follow in 60 days and then an election of the new parliament ( the old one was declared invalid by the now - neutered court system )			1
what to make of all this ? it 's the politics , stupid , or the absence of capacity on both sides to entertain opposing views and forge compromise			2
( @entity70 's " @entity69 " may be the most relevant and compelling how - to guide this season			0
) last week , during my third trip to @entity7 this year , i suggested to the secretary general and a leading member of the @entity48 that they reach out to a group , nominally led by former @entity78 director and former presidential candidate @entity77 , who is now boycotting the process			1
i made the same suggestion to top aides to @entity10			0
they are suspicious that @entity77 has political motives			0
but , hey , of course he does ! as do they			0
opinion : do n't blame @entity6 for @entity10 power grab to be legitimate , @entity7 's new constitution will need to respect the separation of powers ( including an independent judiciary ) and accommodate political differences in a document that passes the international smell test			1
it can not move women back to the @entity98 , and it must embrace pluralism and tolerance for all religions			0
on the other side , liberals and human rights advocates want to play odds that this government will overreach and fail			0
but that 's no guarantee they 'll come next , especially if they do n't bring good political skills with them			0
and their outside game shortchanges the @entity7 people , whose need for food , jobs , fairness and respect are now			2
news : @entity10 's decrees could be lifted in as little as two weeks the secular liberals need to get in the game , not just into @entity27			0
if they do , they can insist on amendments to the constitutional draft that will incorporate their own vision for the future of @entity7			2
more million - man ( and woman ) marches are n't enough			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .			0

@entity134 : @entity7 's opposition , governing party *planned* *dueling* million - man marches
she says this @entity7 model of neither working in the system nor compromising is n't useful
she says @entity18 court *takeover* , *fractious* constitutional process show poor grasp of politics
@entity149 : constitution must respect separation of powers ; secularists must get in process
