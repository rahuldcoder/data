@entity0 , @entity1 -- love it or hate it , the @entity3 came to symbolize @entity5 might over the years -- tires the size of @entity8 , a chrome grill that looked primed to eat up wimpy cars in its path , and its drivers with egos to match their mammoth - mobiles			1
but the iconic vehicle -- a symbol for macho men like @entity19 and ridiculed worldwide by environmentalists -- is headed toward the auto graveyard			2
@entity22 last week announced the likely end of the @entity3 after a deal with a @entity26 automaker fell through			1
the news thrilled many who have protested the guzzler for years : good riddance ! but for @entity3 owners , the reaction remains mixed			1
most mourn the impending death of their beloved behemoths but celebrate the fact that the @entity3 wo n't be outsourced to @entity26 : whose harebrained idea was that anyway ? ! @entity39 n't no hummer meant to be made in @entity26 ! owners are hoping for a last - minute buyer to emerge before the @entity3 joins the maligned @entity43 in the scrapyard			1
@entity22 has said it is trying to salvage the hummer , setting may 1 as a deadline for other possible deals to be made			1
a single sticky note , left on @entity50 's @entity49 , sums up the emotion stirred by the super-sized suvs			1
" you are polluting our air and abusing our national resources , " the unsigned note said			1
" and all because of greed and selfishness			2
you should be very ashamed of yourself			1
" @entity50 , who served in the @entity60 , still gets mad : " it was not even on recycled paper ! " @entity63 installed a supercharger that gave his hummer a whopping 600 horsepower			1
when he really mashed the pedal , it got 1 mile per gallon			2
" it would just move , " he told @entity69			2
check out @entity63 's mega-ride after the @entity72 rolled off the @entity74 assembly line in @entity75 on january 2 , 1985 , it represented a new breed of @entity5 military might and toughness			1
in 1992 , production of the civilian @entity3 began , instantly creating a fraternity among owners of the suv - on - growth hormone			1
they exchange photos of their trucks , chat over the @entity87 and plan for their next muddin ' sessions			2
they laugh at tree huggers who give them the finger as they cruise down the road			2
" i hate to see it die , " says ireporter @entity96 of @entity98 , who owns a 2006 @entity99			0
" you can go anywhere you want			0
" hummer : what might have been the hummer even shares its name with a sexual term			1
how many cars can stake that claim ? and the vehicle became fodder for late - night comedians and @entity87 jokes			0
" you might be driving a @entity3 , " says one joke on a web site devoted to the vehicle , " if you ca n't reach far enough to slap the person sitting in the passenger seat			1
" the grass - roots social justice group @entity119 created an @entity122 campaign during the height of the @entity125 administration , including a @entity126			0
at the top of the list : " the gas mileage alone will kill you			0
" @entity130 of @entity131 gets speechless when talking about his chrome - and - gray - mobile			0
" i love my hummer , " he told @entity69			1
in one photo , he 's leaning against his mud - caked hummer , which looks like it just wallowed in a pigpen			1
" trust me , these tree huggers in their priuses			0
... if a @entity139 hits me , i wo n't get hurt			0
" paniaha hot - dogs in mud @entity143 is n't your ordinary @entity3 owner			1
a lover of his giant suv , he also owns -- are you ready for this ? -- a @entity139			0
" people think i 'm kidding when i say i have both cars , but i do , " said @entity143 , an author and the director of the @entity150 at @entity151			0
" if you combine my carbon footprint ... i do n't feel real guilty about it			0
" a resident of @entity157 , @entity158 , he uses the hummer to get through the @entity161 's brutal winters			1
during last month 's storm , which left the region under a couple of feet of snow , he helped get doctors and nurses to and from a hospital , thanks to his hummer			1
when winter ends , his machismo - meter goes down			2
he grabs his man purse and hops into his prius			0
" my son calls it the nerd - mobile , " he said			0
" i 've had more people razz me about the prius than i have the hummer			2
" " it 's my yin and yang			0
i think they balance each other out			0
" @entity185 : why i own a @entity3 and @entity139 @entity187 of @entity8 is just the opposite			1
she would n't be caught dead in a prius			0
the president of the @entity8 chapter of @entity192 , she 's been driving her solar - flare metallic orange hummer for three years			2
" i use it what it was built for -- off - roading and adventures -- and it has never let me down , " she said			0
" i have met a great group of guys and girls , and we 're like a big family			0
" see @entity8 woman catch air in @entity3 the owners now have one more thing in common : they 're sporting a likely collector 's item			1
but @entity63 's the exception			0
he got rid of his hummer			2
and he still misses it			0
