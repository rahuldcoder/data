@entity0 -- the disgraced politician at the center of @entity8 's biggest political scandal in years has been linked to a criminal act for the first time since he was removed from office , the state - run @entity3 news agency has reported			2
@entity12 , who was head of the @entity13 in the southwestern city of @entity15 and once seen as a future president , was reportedly warned by his former right - hand man that his wife was suspected of murder			1
the revelation came during this week 's trial of @entity22 , @entity12 's former police chief and vice mayor in @entity15			1
in the first official account of the two - day hearing , the court was told that @entity22 was " angrily rebuked " and slapped on the face by @entity12 -- who the report referred to as the major official in charge of @entity15 's municipal party committee -- when he revealed his suspicions , @entity3 said			1
former @entity8 police chief charged @entity22 was on trial charged with abuse of power , defection and bribe - taking			1
the case , which precipitated @entity12 's downfall , began after @entity22 arrived at the @entity42 consulate in the nearby city of @entity44 one evening in february in an apparent asylum attempt			1
during a frenzied 24 hours , he reportedly revealed to @entity42 officials a jaw - dropping tale of corruption and murder involving his boss			2
@entity22 was later collected by central government authorities and disappeared from the public eye			0
timeline : @entity12 's fall from grace according to thursday 's @entity3 report , @entity55 , a former high - ranking police official , heard the exchange between the two men on january 28 this year			1
he told police : " once @entity22 was slapped , the hostility between @entity22 and @entity12 came out into the open			1
" @entity12 's wife , @entity61 , was found guilty of murder in the death of a @entity65 businessman @entity64 last month			1
@entity8 authorities reported that @entity61 and her son had " conflicts " with @entity64 " over economic interests			2
" @entity61 avoids death penalty prosecutors at his trial allege @entity22 knew @entity61 was involved in the murder of @entity64 last november but covered up for her			1
but this relationship became increasingly strained as @entity22 became concerned by the number of people who became aware of the murder case			2
in his confession , @entity22 described how @entity61 became hostile " and began to guard herself against me , " @entity3 said			2
@entity12 had been an influential and controversial member of the @entity13 's politburo , the elite group of 25 men who run @entity8			0
appointed to the top job in @entity15 in 2007 , @entity22 was assigned to lead his crime - fighting program			0
under @entity22 , the " da hei " or smash black campaign reportedly caught nearly 3,000 criminal groups and detained thousands of suspects			0
it also led to the execution of notorious figures in the city 's underworld			0
@entity12 : from rising star to scandal the crackdown , along with economic reforms in the city of more than 30 million , helped burnish the political credentials of @entity12 , who aspired for a spot in the party 's @entity103 , a nine - member body that effectively rules @entity8			2
but @entity22 's heavy - handed , crime - busting methods were decried as brutal by critics			2
@entity12 's red - tinged economic policies -- which have included millions spent on social housing -- garnered him a rock star status in @entity15 but in @entity112 , some party chiefs were taking a different view			1
his populist policies and high - profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the economically liberal and reform - oriented faction within the @entity13 ( @entity13 )			0
the political divisions came to a boil in march when @entity8 's national legislature convened its annual meeting in @entity112			0
speaking to reporters on march 9 on the sidelines of a panel discussion of @entity15 delegates , @entity12 defended his policies			0
" ask any citizen on the street if they support fighting corruption and they 'll say ' yes ' , " he boomed			0
addressing the rich - poor divide , he said : '' if only a few people are rich then we are capitalists , we 've failed			0
" that may have been @entity12 's last stand			1
on march 14 , premier @entity138 obliquely reprimanded @entity15 's leadership over the @entity22 incident during the premier 's annual press conference			0
@entity138 also referred to the damage wrought by the @entity144 -- a reference that alluded to @entity12 's red revival in @entity15 -- and said that the city 's stellar double - digit economic performance had been the fruits of several administrations and not just @entity12 's work alone			1
the following day , @entity12 was sacked and stripped of his political office due to an unspecified " serious breach of party regulations			0
" @entity155 still has n't revealed what those regulations are			0
but until the trial of @entity22 , there had been no suggestion @entity12 had been aware of his wife 's actions before her arrest and conviction for murder			1
