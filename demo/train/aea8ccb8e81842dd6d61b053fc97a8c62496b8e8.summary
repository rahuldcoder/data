@entity0 -- the @entity3 's president @entity2 says a federation of @entity5 is " unavoidable " if @entity5 's embattled common currency is to survive the financial crisis			1
@entity2 's comments to @entity1 followed wednesday 's annual " @entity10 " address , which he delivered in @entity11 , @entity12 , making the case for a unified @entity5 to stem the euro - area 's debt crisis			1
in reference to the euro , shared by 17 - member states , @entity2 told @entity1 : " a single currency depends on the solidity , on the credibility of the institutions and the political construct behind it			2
so , i believe [ a federation ] is going to happen			0
" we are saying that in some areas , like the common currency , like the supervision of the banks , like the common supervision of the budgets , we need this sharing of sovereignty , " he added			0
european institutions are already moving toward a more unified @entity5 in attempts to drag the euro bloc out of its financial mire			1
the @entity39 -- led by president @entity40 -- is undertaking a bond - buying program for fiscally - frail nations in an effort to reduce borrowing costs for the likes of @entity46 and @entity47			0
more : crisis in - depth on wednesday , the @entity3 -- the executive branch of the @entity50 -- presented plans to extend the bank 's powers further			1
@entity2 wants to give the @entity39 a regulatory role for over 6,000 banks operating in the eurozone			2
this raised concerns , particularly by @entity59 , over sovereignty and banking supervision			0
but @entity2 told @entity1 : " citizens of @entity5 are now paying very , very heavy bills because precisely we do n't have that , because the banks are transnational , but the supervision until now is purely national			1
" his comments follow this week 's decision by @entity59 's @entity70 to green light the @entity72 -- the euro area 's permanent bailout fund for debt - ridden nations -- that will come into force in october			0
according to @entity2 , " the @entity72 has a capital that is comparable to the @entity78 , so it 's the @entity5 @entity78 we have now			1
" " it 's quite obvious that to sustain a common currency , we need more common power , " he added			0
@entity2 's call for a federal @entity5 is the latest in a long line of measures taken by @entity5 politicians to forge closer financial ties			1
moves include march 's deal for a " fiscal pact " which will come into force january 2013 , should it be ratified by 12 of the 17 euro countries			0
but @entity2 said such measures would not threaten the sovereignty of participating countries : " it 's a shared sovereignty , " he said			2
" it 's not a transfer of powers from the capitals			0
" @entity2 said he had " no doubts " about the determination of @entity102 -- at the center of the eurozone debt crisis -- to implement reform and retain its place in the common currency			2
according to @entity2 , integration is the only way to compete on the global stage			1
" even the biggest countries in @entity5 alone , if they are on their own , they will not have the leverage to deal with these issues globally , with our @entity117 friends or with the giants of power , like @entity121 and others that are emerging , " he said .			0
