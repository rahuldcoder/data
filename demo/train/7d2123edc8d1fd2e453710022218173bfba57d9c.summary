it does n't tell us much , but a new trailer for season five of " @entity5 " raises a few questions			2
who -- or what -- will be the gang 's next big foe ? what , exactly , is " all that matters " ? where 's @entity14 ? it 's enough to get fans psyched for the mid-season premiere on february 8			1
@entity19 's zombie apocalypse thriller took a break in november after killing off one of the main characters			1
otherwise , @entity22 and the surviving members of his crew are back together , apparently , roaming foggy woods , in pursuit of an unidentified enemy , if the trailer is any indication			0
who do you think will be the next character to meet his or her demise ? tell us on @entity37 .			0
