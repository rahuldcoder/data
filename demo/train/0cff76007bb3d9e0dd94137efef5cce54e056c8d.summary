there 's been plenty of it to go around in @entity5 these first days of summer -- literally and politically -- after the air conditioning went out at a dog kennel			1
@entity9 's deputies found 20 dead dogs piled up in a shed on friday at @entity11 in @entity12			1
the public shock over their deaths led a @entity16 senator to issue a public statement on monday			2
as fate would have it , @entity19 sen. @entity19 's son , @entity18 , was minding the kennel , when the dogs died			1
@entity11 is owned and operated by two of @entity19 's relatives , @entity25 and @entity27 , the @entity24 said			2
the couple was out of town , leaving @entity30 to dogsit , when a dog apparently chewed through the electric wiring connected to the air conditioning , said sheriff @entity34			1
he called it an accident , but at the same time cast doubt on the kennel owners ' account of how the dogs died			1
kennel owners : it was an accident " it was a tragic accident , " @entity27 told @entity0			1
" we are heartbroken , and we 're devastated			0
" she does n't believe anyone could have predicted or stopped what happened			0
the air conditioning unit kicked out in the middle of the night , @entity27 said			0
@entity30 and his wife slept at the east end of the house , while the temperature climbed to seething heights in the kennel on the west end , @entity27 said			1
the dogs sleep there at night in a large , cooled room , she said			2
the two sides of the house have separate air conditioning units , so the @entity64 could n't feel the suffocating heat			0
during the day in @entity12 , the mercury has blasted up to over 100 degrees f , easily making it hard to find relief , perhaps even after temperatures dip back down to under 80 at night			0
by the time the @entity64 discovered the dogs at 5:30 a.m. , the temperature was over 100 degrees , @entity27 said			2
the gnawed wire was still sputtering off sparks			0
" it could have burned down our whole house , " @entity27 said			0
" my whole house could have burned down and all my children could have died , and then it would have been a tragedy			2
" one of the dogs that perished was her own			2
the flakes turned a hose and ice on the overheated dogs to try to save them , the sheriff 's office said			1
" @entity89 failed to call for emergency assistance before the dogs died			1
" sheriff : story " seems unreasonable " sheriff @entity34 said that his office is investigating and that parts of @entity27 ' story seems suspicious			1
" it seems unreasonable that dogs could be healthy at 11 p.m. at night and dead by 5:30 a.m. the next morning as the owners suggest , " he said			1
a veterinarian he conferred with has corroborated his doubts , @entity34 said			0
deputies arrived to find some of the dogs ' owners at @entity106			1
a couple cried and hugged , as deputies used a wheel barrow to cart off dogs ' carcasses wrapped in cloth			1
pet owners told @entity34 that the @entity27 misled them about the number of dogs kept at the kennel			1
the @entity27 have not been arrested or charged , @entity0 affiliate @entity117 reported			0
prodigal embarrassments news of the pet deaths on his son 's watch were followed by a statement from sen. @entity19			2
" i ca n't imagine the devastating loss these families are experiencing			0
my heart goes out to the owners who lost their beloved pets , " he said			0
this is the second summer in a row that a member of @entity19 's family was involved in a controversy			0
in june of last year , another son , @entity138 , reportedly published racial epithets , homophobic slurs and anti-semitic remarks on @entity142 and used them as user names in online games			0
