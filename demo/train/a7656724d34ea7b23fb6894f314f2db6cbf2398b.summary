@entity0 -- @entity3 chief of staff @entity2 used former president @entity4 as an intermediary last year as part of a failed administration effort to dissuade @entity9 rep. @entity8 from running for the @entity10 , according to a publicly released memorandum from the @entity3 legal counsel 's office			1
top @entity3 lawyer @entity14 conceded that " options for executive branch service were raised " for @entity8 , but insisted that administration officials did not act improperly			1
he characterized the attempt to influence @entity9 's @entity21 @entity10 primary -- ultimately won by @entity8 -- as no different from political maneuvers by past administrations from both political parties			1
@entity25 disagreed with @entity14 's assessment			0
several @entity3 @entity28 members sent a letter to the @entity30 friday asking for an investigation			1
the @entity3 was instrumental in last year 's switch by @entity9 sen. @entity33 from the @entity28 to the @entity21			1
president @entity34 backed @entity33 in his bid for a sixth term in the @entity10 , and the administration was eager to clear the field of any primary opponents			1
@entity14 stated in the memo that efforts " were made in june and july of 2009 to determine whether congressman @entity8 would be interested in service on a presidential or other senior executive @entity42 , which would avoid a divisive @entity10 primary , allow him to retain his seat in the @entity3 , and provide him with an opportunity for additional service to the public in a high - level advisory capacity			1
" @entity8 would not have been paid for any advisory work , @entity14 insisted			2
@entity2 " enlisted the support of former president clinton who agreed to raise with ... @entity8 options of service , " @entity14 said			2
@entity8 declined the suggested options , he said			2
" last summer , i received a phone call from president @entity4 , " @entity8 confirmed friday in a written statement			1
" during the course of the conversation , he expressed concern over my prospects if i were to enter the @entity21 primary for @entity10			2
... he said that @entity3 chief of staff @entity2 had spoken with him about my being on a presidential board while remaining in the @entity66			2
i said no. " @entity14 said that the @entity3 , contrary to one widely circulated rumor , did not offer @entity8 the position of secretary of the navy			1
he noted @entity34 nominated @entity70 for the position on march 26 , 2009 , more than a month before @entity33 switched to the @entity21			0
@entity14 insisted there was no impropriety in the @entity3 's efforts			2
" the @entity21 leadership had a legitimate interest in averting a divisive primary fight and a similarly legitimate concern about the congressman vacating his seat in the @entity3 , " he wrote			2
the @entity3 's attempt to keep @entity8 out of the @entity10 race was " fully consistent with the relevant law and ethical requirements			1
" @entity86 @entity28 rep. @entity85 , who has pushed for the appointment of a special prosecutor to examine the incident , vehemently disagreed with @entity14 's conclusions			2
the @entity3 " has admitted to a misdemeanor ... and co-opted president @entity4 " in it , @entity85 insisted			1
" is @entity2 going to stay if in fact he violated the law ? " @entity4 " of all people would be held to a standard of knowing exactly where the line is , " @entity85 said			0
" if he crossed it , he crossed it knowingly			0
" @entity85 said that it is " not the job offer [ but ] the quid pro quo			0
... it 's the ' i will give you this job to clear a primary			0
' " @entity85 joined several other @entity109 in urging the @entity30 to investigate allegations of bribery			0
" assurances by the @entity34 @entity3 that no laws were broken are like the @entity114 promising it did nothing illegal in connection with @entity117			1
clearly , an independent investigation is necessary to determine once and for all what really happened , " they wrote in a letter to fbi director @entity121			0
@entity8 , a former @entity123 admiral and two - term @entity125 - area congressman , dismissed the @entity28 's allegations of wrongdoing , telling reporters that if he had thought something was wrong , he would have reported it			1
" @entity0 , is often about political deals , " @entity8 said			0
he insisted that @entity4 spoke to him only once about the proposal			1
@entity34 said thursday that he can " assure the public that nothing improper took place			0
" the president , however , refused to give any more details , even as some @entity21 have demanded the @entity3 be more forthcoming about the matter			0
since @entity8 's may 18 primary victory , republicans have been relentless in keeping the controversy in the news			0
on wednesday , all seven @entity28 members of the @entity144 called for a special prosecutor to look into the matter			0
one of the unpaid positions that the @entity3 suggested offering @entity8 was an appointment to the president 's @entity149 , which gives the president independent oversight and advice			1
but it was determined that @entity8 could not serve on the board , since he was an active a member of @entity156			0
it appears that @entity2 picked @entity4 as a go - between with @entity8 because of the former president 's stature as an elder statesman and prominent figure in the @entity21 , and because @entity8 worked on the @entity163 during @entity4 's years in the @entity3			1
@entity8 backed former first lady and then - sen. @entity165 in the 2008 democratic presidential primaries			0
according to a source at the @entity168 , @entity2 remains on a trip to @entity170 and is not expected to be back in the country until monday			0
@entity1 's @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
