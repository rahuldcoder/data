-- according to @entity1 's latest commercial , " @entity3 goes anywhere " -- anywhere , that is , except for @entity7			1
@entity8 confirmed with the stadium that the @entity3 falls under its " no laptops " security policy and patrons wo n't be able to enter the ballpark with one in their possession			1
say what ? the @entity16 says that you do n't have to take an @entity3 out of its case to go through security , but @entity7 says the device is a no - go ? the discussion surrounding the ban was spurred by a message from @entity24 on the @entity25			1
@entity24 tried to bring her @entity3 in to the @entity28 / @entity27 game , only to be turned away at the gate			0
undeterred , she did re-enter the stadium with her @entity3 in her jacket , but the ban exists all the same			0
while you can reasonably ask why someone would want to bring an @entity3 -- or any electronic device aside from a cellphone , for that matter -- into a ballgame , the outright ban of such a device strikes us as odd , especially given that @entity41 is available throughout the complex			0
in any event , if you want to bring an @entity3 to @entity7 this summer ( assuming you 're sitting in the shade ) , you might want to make sure you 've got a bag or windbreaker that can mask said device from the security guards			2
