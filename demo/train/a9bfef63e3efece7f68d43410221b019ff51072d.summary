-- @entity1 is often touted as among the most conservative places in the world , with women forbidden even to drive			1
but in terms of attitude toward women 's freedom of choice in clothing , it 's significantly more freethinking than some of its neighbors , a survey of seven muslim - majority countries suggests			1
nearly two out of three people in @entity1 believe women should keep everything but their eyes covered when they are in a public place -- but at the same time , nearly half say it is up to a woman to dress however she wants			1
that puts it on a level with socially liberal @entity27 , and ranks it as far less conservative than @entity29 , @entity30 or @entity31			1
" @entity1 is not as conservative as it appears			1
definitely on some level there is a considerable liberal leaning , " said @entity32 , the lead author of the study			0
that could be partly a reaction to the conservative leadership , he said			0
" @entity1 has had a religious government for a long time			2
people tend to develop an oppositional attitude , " he argued			0
the findings come from a report published by the @entity45 of the @entity47 's @entity46			0
it suggests @entity31 is , in terms of gender relations , the most conservative country in the study by some distance			1
only 14 % of @entity31 believe women should be allowed to choose how they dress , the lowest level in the survey			1
@entity31 are also the most likely to say that a woman should be required to obey her husband -- only one @entity31 in 20 disagreed			1
@entity32 does not link @entity31 conservatism to religion			2
" @entity31 have become more sexist in the past decade			2
they have become less religious , less supportive of @entity60 ( @entity62 law ) , but on the issue of gender , more conservative , " he said			0
" the problem with @entity31 is not just religion , it is an intellectual trend			2
it is hard to say what caused the @entity31 to become less supportive of gender equality , " he said , but suggested it could be due to general social turmoil			2
" when there is a high level of social insecurity , people tend to fall back on traditional values , " he said			0
his study is primarily an investigation of social attitudes in @entity83 , which the report labels the birthplace of the @entity86 , toward a wide variety of subjects including political engagement , national identity , secularism and violence against @entity93			0
but it delves into comparisons between @entity83 and six other countries : @entity1 , @entity31 , @entity97 , @entity27 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
in one of the survey 's most striking questions , researchers showed people pictures of women with six different types of head covering , ranging from the full - body burqa to no covering at all			0
they asked people to say which was the most appropriate way for women to dress in public			0
across the seven countries , the most popular answer was a tight - fitting white scarf that completely covered the hair and ears but showed the entire face -- a type of hijab			1
just over half of @entity31 chose that option , as did well over half -- 57 % -- in @entity83 , and just under half in @entity29 and @entity97			1
but there were significant differences from country to country			0
@entity27 was the most liberal , with nearly half ( 49 % ) of respondents saying women should not wear any head covering at all , and another 12 % opting for a loosely - fitting headscarf that showed some hair			1
at the same time , only 49 % said it should be up to a woman to choose how she dresses			0
@entity97 , which for decades banned women from wearing headscarves in public and is now in the middle of a controversy over the subject , was arguably the next most liberal country after @entity27			0
one in three ( 32 % ) said a woman should not wear any head covering , while another 17 % chose the loose headscarf			0
just over half ( 52 % ) of @entity97 said a woman should be allowed to choose how she dresses			1
@entity1 was the most conservative in terms of personal opinion , with about two out of three people ( 63 % ) saying a woman should wear a niqab , covering the entire head and face , showing only the eyes			1
another 11 % picked the full burqa , showing nothing at all of a woman 's head and including a mesh over the face			0
and yet @entity1 fell in the middle of the pack in terms of whether women should be allowed to choose what they wear , with 47 % supporting it			1
only @entity1 had more than token support for the burqa , with just 4 % supporting it in @entity29 , 3 % backing it in @entity30 , and numbers even lower in the other countries			2
surveys were carried out between january 2011 and june 2013 for the study , " @entity170 : values and perceptions of the @entity173 in a @entity174			0
" the study was based on interviews with 2,005 people in @entity1 and at least 3,000 in each of the other countries			2
the report , published in december , did not say what the margins of error were			0
the seven countries include several but not all of the most populous countries in the broader @entity184 , from @entity185 to @entity186			2

a tight - fitting scarf is the most appropriate thing for a woman to wear , @entity184 say
nearly half of @entity1 say a woman should be allowed to choose what she wears
@entity31 is the most conservative country in the region by some measures
