-- if you 're looking for love and not having much luck , maybe you could increase your success by getting a bit more passionate -- about helping others			2
@entity7 and @entity8 share a love of volunteer work in @entity11			2
when singles write to advice columnists complaining about being lonely , they are often urged to volunteer			2
@entity15 , the public relations director for @entity16 , says it 's not unusual for their volunteers to meet on a building site and " end up together			1
" @entity21 was living in @entity22 and his future wife , @entity23 , was living in @entity24 , @entity25 , when the two met in @entity26 in 1996 while volunteering on a @entity27			1
" i thought she was an attractive young lady , " recalls @entity21 , adding that they were working 10 - 12 hour days so it was n't until the project was almost complete that they got to spend much time together			1
both were committed volunteers and had signed up for a @entity16 fundraising bike ride of 500 miles two weeks after they returned to the @entity36			1
they got to know each other while pedaling from @entity38 to @entity39 , @entity40			2
the two got married one year later atop a house they helped build during another project in @entity44 , @entity38			1
other volunteers had cleaned and scraped a ladder so the bride would n't get her wedding gown dirty climbing to the roof			1
the groom wore a tuxedo , a local minister officiated and a fiddler joined them on the roof to provide the music			2
this year , @entity21 , 56 , and @entity58 , 46 , will again work on former president @entity60 's 2009 @entity16 work project , building houses in five countries : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 -- along the @entity68 in southeast @entity69			1
in 2007 , @entity7 and @entity8 found each other while helping @entity72 victims in @entity11 , @entity73			2
@entity7 had been a pro golfer playing mini-tours in @entity75 and living half the year in @entity76 , @entity77 , when he got the urge to drive down to @entity11 to volunteer			2
" i really liked the place , and the people , " says @entity7			2
" the original plan was to come down here for two months and go to a friend 's wedding , but i ended up staying			1
" at first the 30 - something golfer worked for @entity16 , learning plumbing and wiring			1
then he went to work with @entity89 , 2008 @entity90 , at the @entity91			2
meanwhile , @entity8 , 36 , an interpreter for the deaf in the western @entity93 of @entity94 , began a series of trips in july 2007 to work with volunteers in the same area			1
@entity8 was smitten after meeting @entity7 on her first trip , but he merely smiled and went back to work			2
" he was doing a little of everything , a runner , bringing supplies , our construction manager , " @entity8 remembers			0
" i thought , you know , i am just another volunteer to him			0
" there were several more trips , a few chance meetings -- but no sparks			0
but something changed when they met yet again in december 2008 at a friend 's @entity114			1
" we just hit it off that night , " @entity7 says			0
@entity7 says he was attracted to her for a million little reasons : " she 's attractive , fun to be around and both of us are kind of easygoing			1
" but then it was time for @entity8 to go back to @entity125 and for @entity7 to make the long drive to @entity127 to see his relatives			0
@entity7 's @entity130 plans fell though , so he asked @entity8 about coming down			1
they hung out for a few days and @entity7 was set to drive by himself back to @entity11			0
" she hopped in the car with me , and came down			0
it really surprised the people who knew her , " @entity7 says , " because she is the kind of person who likes to plan everything			0
" " @entity141 , it did surprise people , " @entity8 admits			0
" i am very conservative , a planner , it was out of context for me			0
" they both admit they are at a crossroads of sorts			0
psychologist @entity149 , author of the book , " @entity151 , " says the couple 's relationship could go either way			1
" i 've seen couples come together in some kind of mission or some kind of movement , and they work together really well when they 're within the mission			0
there 's a sense of a bond because of their joint commitment to the mission , " says @entity149			1
" but then when the mission ends , or if it ends , they just look at each other and find they have nothing in common			0
" " however , i 've also seen it where couples come together like this and basically decide to stay on the mission the rest of their lives			0
and they marry and they stay on the mission			0
their marriage is all about being together and helping each other fulfill their purpose in this mission , " @entity149 says			0
that 's what happened to @entity179 and @entity180 , who met in 1985 while working for several weeks in @entity25 on a book promotion for the @entity180 , an organization dedicated to ending hunger and poverty in the world			1
" the last night when we all went out for a drink , we kind of looked at each other and noticed who we 'd been working with all that time -- and we 've been together ever since , " said @entity186 , 62 , adding that her husband , 57 , always says , " we 're living happily ever after			1
" the couple , who have no children , are both on staff at the organization			1
" we 've had a relationship that was formed within @entity180 and that has always been our senior mission , part of a senior commitment , " said @entity186			1
" and within that we 've created a partnership and a marriage			0
" their shared passion for their work has driven them during their more than two - decade marriage			1
" as we 've gotten older , we 've sort of rediscovered the rest of life and we 've continued to be partners , not only in work , but also in our leisure and the rest of our life			0
we 're wonderfully compatible and enjoy vacation and nonwork time as much as working together , " says the veteran volunteer			1
the younger volunteer couple is still pondering their relationship			1
" we 're not trying to put pressure on ourselves , we are trying to have a good time , " @entity7 says			0
but they are certain about one thing			0
" our passion is to be down here with the @entity91 , " says @entity8			2
" you know , that is how life works , " @entity7 said			0
" it works in strange ways			0
stuff you do n't plan on is the stuff you remember			0
