-- the @entity2 man who saturday became the first @entity3 elected to the @entity4 says he hopes his win will push more young people to become politically active			1
@entity7 says his win shows that " really anything can happen			1
" " i am very honored and at this point , somewhat speechless to be the first @entity3 - @entity11 congressman , " @entity7 told @entity0 on sunday			1
" but i also hope that many of our young people will consider being more politically active and being move involved in the community			1
because as you can see , really anything can happen			0
" the @entity19 defeated nine - term @entity21 rep. @entity20 in the mostly @entity11 and heavily @entity21 @entity23 - area district			1
@entity20 had been expected to win a 10th term despite battling scandals and a federal indictment for the past three years			1
the contest , which drew a light turnout , was delayed until saturday after @entity29 swept through southern @entity2 in late august			1
had the vote been held during the november 4 general election , @entity20 -- who is black -- may have benefited from the heavy @entity11 voter turnout for @entity33			2
@entity7 conceded that low voter turnout aided his victory			2
" we were hoping for a low turnout because it would provide us with the greater chance of winning , " said @entity7 , a lawyer and community activist			2
" based on the demographics of the district , a high voter turnout would have gone to our disadvantage			0
" @entity7 also may have been helped by the scandal that has plagued @entity20			1
@entity20 , who pleaded not guilty to 16 criminal counts of racketeering , bribery , money laundering and obstruction of justice , denies any wrongdoing			2
in 2005 , @entity20 's private homes in @entity53 and @entity23 were raided , and @entity55 agents say they found $ 90,000 in cash stashed in one of his freezers			0
officials say the money was part of a payment in marked bills from an @entity55 informant in a transaction captured on videotape			0
@entity20 also is accused of soliciting and receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes for himself and his family in exchange for promoting their products and services to countries in @entity74			0
@entity7 said he came to the @entity75 at the age of 8 after his family fled @entity77 as it fell to communists			0
" when i [ was ] 9 years old , i received a letter from my father while he was in the re-education camp , " @entity7 said			0
" he told me to study hard , to work hard and to give back to your country and to your community			0
so i hope to do that in @entity87			0
