-- a new regional branch of @entity2 infiltrated @entity4 's navy and tried to hijack a vessel earlier this month to launch rocket attacks on @entity8 ships in the @entity9 , a site that monitors terror groups said			1
it was the first major offensive by the newly formed @entity2 in the @entity12			1
the @entity14 's monitoring service said the group 's spokesman , @entity15 , on @entity17 compared the @entity4 naval officers involved in the attempted hijacking to @entity20 , the @entity21 psychiatrist convicted of killing 13 people at @entity23			2
@entity20 was sentenced to death by a military court for the november 5 , 2009 , rampage , which authorities said the @entity8 - born @entity28 carried out because he did not want to deploy to @entity30 to fight other @entity31			2
@entity15 's tweet on wednesday said the group sought to avenge the " bloodshed of @entity31 " from @entity30 to @entity34 as well as what it called @entity8 control and superiority over " ours straits , our channels and our waters			2
" the september 6 hijacking attempt of the @entity47 navy vessel @entity48 in @entity49 ended after a fire fight in which three attackers were killed and seven others arrested , @entity4 defense minister @entity44 told parliament on september 10			1
a naval officer was killed			0
" we can not rule out inside help in this attack because , without it , the miscreants could not breach security , " @entity44 said			0
a @entity4 navy source said the investigation is still under way and the attack could be linked to any network			1
according to site , @entity2 in the @entity12 claimed credit for the attack and even posted a picture and schematic of the @entity4 naval ship on @entity17			1
" these mujahideen had taken control of the @entity4 ship , and they were advancing towards the @entity8 fleet when the @entity4 army stopped them , " said the tweet quoted by @entity66			1
" as a result , the mujahideen , the lions of @entity80 and benefactors of the @entity82 , sacrificed their lives for @entity80 , and the @entity4 soldiers spoiled their hereafter by giving up their lives in defense of the enemies of the @entity82 the @entity8 , " the group said on @entity17			2
after the attack , three naval officials were arrested during a raid on the outskirts of the city of @entity96 near the @entity30 border			0
the officials said the suspects were trying to escape to @entity30			0
earlier this month , @entity2 leader @entity102 , in an effort to reclaim relevancy , announced the creation of @entity2 in the @entity12 , led by @entity104 , which will include at least one faction of the @entity4 @entity106			1
according to a translation by the @entity14 , @entity15 said the group 's basic goals included jihad against @entity8 , supporting the @entity106 and establishing a caliphate ( implicitly rejecting the @entity112 claimed by @entity115 leader @entity113 )			2
the announcement steps up the philosophical battle between @entity2 and @entity115 about how the dream of the caliphate , to which @entity31 the world over would owe allegiance , is achieved			0
@entity15 spoke of " a caliphate where the emirs are proud in their closeness to the honest scholars ... a caliphate in whose shadow even the disbelieving people of @entity128 ( @entity130 citizens of an @entity132 state ) have a life of safety and security			0
" the last condition was clearly aimed at @entity115 and its merciless campaign against non-muslims and @entity31 in both @entity139 and @entity34			0
not to be outdone , @entity115 ' propaganda machine recently posted photographs showing residents of the @entity139 city of @entity144 enjoying " prosperity ... under the shade of the caliphate			0
" @entity102 may be counting on the withdrawal of most @entity8 combat forces from @entity30 as his best chance of reviving @entity2 's fortunes			1
agent storm : inside @entity2 for the @entity152 @entity0 's @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
