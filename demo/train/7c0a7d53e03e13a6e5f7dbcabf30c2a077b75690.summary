a crying mother cradles and moves her dead baby to the floor , yelling out , " my child , my child			0
" outside , another woman shakes and gestures in a fit of absolute grief as she piercingly screams , " pray to @entity9 and his prophet sister			0
" both women had brought their children to a clinic in a rebel - held part of northwestern @entity16 , hoping to help save their lives			1
instead , at least 15 children -- all under the age of 2 -- died after receiving measles vaccinations through a @entity22 - sponsored program			1
as many as 50 other children got sick after what a @entity22 report described as a " bungled immunization			1
" so how did it happen ? @entity16 's foreign ministry blames " this catastrophe ( on ) leaders of the armed terrorist organizations " -- a term president @entity37 's government uses for rebel groups -- " and their supporters ... the @entity40 authorities , " according to a report from the state - run @entity30 ( @entity30 )			1
in a joint statement , the @entity42 and @entity43 said wednesday that the groups ' vaccination program in @entity48 and @entity49 provinces has been halted as a team of experts try to get to the bottom of the situation			0
a spokesman for the @entity42 , the public health arm of the @entity22 , said a preliminary investigation suggests the deaths can be attributed not to a criminal act but simple human error			1
the @entity42 spokesman , @entity60 , said early reports suggest medics may have accidentally mixed a high - dose muscle relaxant into the vaccine powder instead of the designated serum			1
" apparently , in the same fridge ... where the vaccines were stored , there was also a muscle relaxant , " @entity60 explained thursday to @entity66 , adding the vaccine itself likely was n't contaminated			0
" the muscle relaxant vial looks like the same vial as the vaccine			0
" this explanation may not do much right now to blunt the agony and anger of those who saw children die this week in @entity16 's @entity48 province			1
some distressed parents and local authorities have demanded not only an investigation , but that the medical personnel involved be put on trial , according to @entity86 , an @entity87 activist in the town of @entity89			0
the @entity16 government sent letters to the @entity22 describing the incident as " an ugly crime " and claiming the children were given " rotten , spoiled and poisoned vaccines , " @entity30 reported			1
notably , the vaccinations were administered in areas that the @entity99 - based central government does n't control , and therefore may not have direct knowledge of			2
and therein lies a larger issue : @entity16 's years - long civil war has caused number of humanitarian crises , including related to the spread of infectious diseases -- including ones , like measles , that can be tackled through immunizations			1
there 's widespread violence and very little functioning government in some areas , leaving people young and old at risk			2
in december 2012 , the @entity42 and @entity43 announced they would work with @entity16 's health ministry to distribute at least 1.5 million doses of measles vaccine in government - controlled areas			1
still , hundreds of thousands of others are in areas not controlled by @entity37 's government			2
@entity124 , also known as @entity125 , noted in june 2013 that at least 7,000 people had been infected in a measles epidemic in northern @entity16			2
this is why @entity22 organizations stepped in , hoping to address a dire need through vaccinations			2
yet no one imagined the scenes that unfolded this week in @entity89			0
@entity134 , another @entity87 activist , described one child dying in front of him			0
" the child slowly ran out of breath before my eyes , " @entity134 recalled			0
" doctors rushed to save some ( children ) and placed oxygen masks on their faces			0
" while the vaccination program may be stopped for now , that does n't mean it wo n't someday resume			0
@entity60 , the @entity42 spokesman , said that there are " strong guidelines " in place to avoid a situation like this one , " but we can not avoid 100 % of human error			1
" " the major challenge , " @entity60 said , " is to make sure this campaign can continue safely			0

@entity22 : children die , at least 50 sickened after " bungled immunization " in northern @entity16
the measles immunizations were part of a @entity22 - sponsored campaign in rebel - held areas
@entity42 spokesman : early reports suggests human error was to blame
@entity16 's government calls the incident an " ugly crime , " blames " terrorist organizations "
