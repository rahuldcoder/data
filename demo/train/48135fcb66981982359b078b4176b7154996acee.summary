-- a few months into the @entity2 war , @entity3 , then a three - star general and commander of the storied @entity6 , told @entity0 about what it would take to win			1
" frankly , " he said , " the way ahead will require a lot of determination and just plain old ingenuity and stick - to - itiveness			0
" it was january 2004 and the @entity14 had lost 60 men and women			2
no one could have predicted accurately the course of the war then , but @entity3 stuck to his playbook , eventually becoming the top @entity14 commander in @entity2 , leading @entity14 counterinsurgency operations and , in 2007 , a strategy to overcome a bloody insurgency that was fronted by a surge in troops			1
applauded for turning around what seemed a losing battle in @entity2 -- he was dubbed @entity30 for his successes -- @entity3 later went to @entity32 , commanding @entity14 and @entity34 forces there			1
he is arguably the most influential general of his generation			1
in fact , @entity37 called him one of the most influential people of the 21st century			0
but after a career that began after graduation in 1974 from @entity42 and as a second lieutenant in the infantry , @entity3 is hanging up the uniform for a civilian suit , leaving the @entity47 for halls of another hallowed @entity50 institution : the @entity49			1
@entity3 relinquishes his @entity32 post on monday			1
in an official ceremony , he will hand over command to @entity55 lt. gen. @entity54			0
@entity3 plans to retire from the @entity56 at the end of august and assume the @entity49 director 's job september 6			1
some were stunned that a decorated military career was ending prematurely			0
" i wanted this job , " @entity3 said at his @entity63 confirmation hearing			0
" i am taking off the uniform i have worn for 37 years to do this the right way			0
" with that , the @entity56 is losing the architect of modern - day counterinsurgency operations			0
@entity3 wrote his doctoral dissertation on the lessons @entity14 learned in @entity73			2
later , he devised the @entity56 / @entity55 field manual , challenging the military to think differently in how it relates to the civilian population in dealing with an insurgency			0
this week , ahead of his departure , @entity3 assessed the results of his strategy in @entity32			1
" what we have done is implement the so - called @entity34 comprehensive approach , a civil - military campaign ... that does indeed embody many of the principles of the counterinsurgency field manual that we developed back in 2006 , and which we employed in @entity2 in the surge of 2007 - 2008 , " he said in an interview with @entity83			1
" i think generally , it has borne fruit			0
" he said it has been a difficult journey , rife with setbacks , but coalition forces have halted the momentum of the @entity98 in much of the country and reversed the insurgent hold in restive @entity102 province			0
@entity3 's experience in working with the @entity49 on counterinsurgency efforts in the field was cited as a reason for his nomination as the spy agency 's director			1
@entity3 told @entity83 that he never thought his military career would end in @entity32			1
the top commander 's job came unexpectedly after a @entity114 magazine article prompted the resignation of gen. @entity116			2
@entity117 asked @entity3 to leave the top post at @entity119			2
he took command in @entity32 on july 4 , 2010			0
" we 've jokingly said that i went to the @entity122 for the monthly @entity124 meeting on @entity32 and @entity125 with president @entity117 , and came out with a new job , " @entity3 said			2
" and that 's not far from the truth			0
