two civilians and two @entity32 died in the attack			0
the @entity1 military said thursday that its drills will take place in the seas southwest of @entity0 between december 18 and 21 , but bad weather forced a delay saturday			1
@entity1 's @entity41 news agency reported the drills will take place monday or tuesday in the @entity43 off the island			1
as villagers departed , few signs of life remained on the island -- only military trucks patrolling and waiting for possible @entity7 retaliation for the drills			1
not everyone on @entity0 , however , was leaving			2

the @entity74 drew the line three nautical miles from the @entity7 coast and put five islands close to the coast under @entity1 control			1
that was supposed to be a temporary arrangement			0
but in the absence of a full peace agreement , the @entity72 remains in place			0
@entity7 has suggested an alternative line , but @entity1 has resisted , as it would bring the @entity7 's maritime boundary close to @entity13 , a main port			1
waters in the @entity43 are important for fishing and crab			0
for @entity7 fishermen especially , the blue crab season between june and september is an important source of income			2
crabs have a habit of migrating south during that time , so the water is sometimes crowded with boats from both countries , as well as vessels from @entity100			0
however , the @entity43 has seen armed clashes in the past few years , the most serious of them in 1999 and 2002			0
