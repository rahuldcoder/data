-- the @entity1 was in full effect at the first presidential debate in @entity4 on wednesday night			0
@entity5 put forward a strong performance , transforming back into his 2002 @entity8 moderate mold , a belated advocate of bipartisan leadership			2
it would have had a lot more impact if it had n't contradicted almost every policy statement @entity5 has made on the campaign trail since he started running for president			1
this flip - flopping is a force of habit , but it was used to great effect , reflecting a campaign and a candidate finally focused on the general electorate			1
president @entity25 , in turn , had an objectively weak debate			1
the president was more professor than preacher , a budget wonk getting lost in paragraphs of detail rather than concisely punching back			0
he fulfilled the political truism that incumbent presidents have bad first debates because they are comparatively unprepared and overburdened by budgets and other details of governing -- as president @entity38 did in his disastrous first 1984 debate			0
the trick of communicating policy is to distill it to memorable concise concepts			0
that happened far too rarely , and when it did , it seemed to be off the cuff , winning @entity25 points for authenticity but few for debate prep			2
opinion : @entity5 shakes up the race the audacity of the @entity1 was evident in the first 15 minutes of the debate , when @entity5 said , " i will not reduce the taxes paid by high - income @entity54			1
" it was an eye - popping assertion , almost as if the candidate had n't been listening to his own campaign rhetoric -- especially if you 'd been following @entity5 's campaign rhetoric for the past 18 months or more			1
( remember that " @entity1 " entered the campaign lexicon in march , when @entity5 adviser @entity63 signaled on @entity0 that @entity5 could transform his primary campaign message for the general election			2
) the pattern continued with @entity5 asserting that after repealing @entity67 , he would advocate the implementation of his own individual mandate plan -- " and the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state " -- but it would be state by state , along a federalist model			2
@entity5 did not hesitate to play the @entity79 card -- the most discredited @entity81 tactic against entitlement reform , but apparently acceptable if it is done by a @entity83 trying to win @entity84			1
happily , for hypocrisy watchers , this move also scored worst with the focus group of undecided voters conducted by @entity0 's @entity89 in @entity4 during the debate			0
the litany of flip - flops increased when the candidates ' policy positions were pushed for specifics			1
it was a necessary goal that was n't aided by the too often unfocused moderation of veteran newsman @entity98 , who did not need a 12th presidential debate under his belt			0
among the gaps was the question of whether @entity5 supports ending " too big to fail " -- which might mean breaking up the big banks , and / or restoring safeguards from the 1933 @entity107 banking reform act , repealed in 1999 -- or simply repealing the 2010 @entity109 law , which regulates @entity110			2
on that issue , as well as on @entity67 , it was not clear what @entity5 would put in place of the laws he plans to repeal			0
@entity5 seemed to indicate he would end oil company subsidies if corporate rates were lowered enough -- that 's news to @entity120 , i 'm guessing			1
@entity5 said @entity25 should have backed the @entity122 's deficit reduction proposals ( i agree ) , but did not back the recommendations of that panel himself			1
opinion : @entity5 was n't stellar , but @entity25 fell short he advocated a balanced deficit reduction plan but refused to raise any revenue -- and perhaps unwisely said he 'd kill " @entity130 " icon @entity128 in the process			1
his enthusiasm for budget cutting does not square with his commitment to increasing military spending to 4 % of gdp			0
likewise , he was n't pressed -- by @entity25 or @entity98 -- to specify the loophole closures which @entity5 said would make his 20 % tax cuts revenue - neutral for top income earners			1
whenever @entity98 did try to assert himself as a moderator , @entity5 reflexively bristled -- he is not a man who likes being told he has to conform to other people 's rules			2
the president 's strategic decision to try to find rhetorical common ground on policy at the outset came across as passive rather than conciliatory			0
his correct pressing on the fact that many of @entity5 's stated economic plans " do not add up " got lost in paragraphs rather than topic sentences			1
to be fair , @entity25 had a few good lines -- dismissing @entity5 's economic plan by saying " math , common sense , and our history shows us that 's not a recipe for job growth			1
" his pushback on @entity110 reform was also memorable : " does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of @entity110 ? because if you do , then gov. @entity5 is your candidate			2
but that 's not what i believe			0
" but @entity5 exceeded expectations and put forward a confident debate performance that was especially impressive given its disregard for his own past policy positions			2
@entity5 shone in the moments he discussed the generational theft of deficits and debt			1
in contrast , @entity25 did not come ready for combat , even in a @entity186 egghead way			0
assessments of presidential debate performances tend to evolve over the next day , reflecting a combination of spin , fact - checking and conventional wisdom			0
this first debate will be subject to the same evolution , as partisans on both sides try furiously to spin the debate in their direction			0
a flip - flop ad , contrasting past statements with debate statements , could be effective for either campaign			1
it 's worth remembering that many swing voters who have lives were watching the high - stakes season - ending baseball games , instead of obsessively trolling @entity207 for debate commentary			0
opinion : it was n't just @entity5 who won in the search for honest brokers -- patriots , not partisans -- we can only hope that the truth , ever elusive , will win out in the end , because we ultimately get the government we deserve			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			0

@entity220 : @entity5 's effectiveness *overshadowed* his many flip - flops
he says @entity83 candidate broke with his more *conservative* positions , aimed for the center
president @entity25 failed to make an effective case for his policies , @entity220 says
@entity220 : @entity5 shone when he discussed the generational theft of deficits and debt
