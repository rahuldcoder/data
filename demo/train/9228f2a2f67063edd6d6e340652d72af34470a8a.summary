-- a proposed mosque and @entity3 center in @entity4 , @entity5 , is dividing the city about 35 miles southeast of @entity7 , @entity5			1
residents are battling about whether the center should exist , and if not , why not			1
the @entity10 currently resides in the southwest part of town			1
the center purchased a new 15 - acre site just a few miles to the east in november for $ 320,000 , according to its website , with plans to build on the property			1
proponents of the mosque allege the opponents are displaying religious intolerance , while people fighting the mosque say zoning concerns and worries about @entity3 radicalism are their chief concerns			1
several hundred opponents marching from a middle school to a courthouse faced off against roughly the same number of counter-protesters wednesday			1
protesters bore signs with slogans such as " mosque leaders support killing converts			1
" " in @entity3 , a mosque means ' we have conquered this country , ' " one man told @entity0 affiliate @entity41			1
" and where are they ? they 're in the center of @entity5			2
they 're going to say , ' we have conquered @entity5			2
' " despite the polarizing debate , the march was nonviolent			2
@entity53 spokesman @entity52 said thursday that " no reports of any kind " were filed			2
@entity56 , who led the protest , said opponents are " going to contend every brick that 's laid			1
" " we 're going to keep marching , attending meetings , " @entity56 said			2
" there may be legal stuff coming down the road at some point			2
" @entity56 said he 's mainly concerned about water quality , soil contamination and traffic flow on the nearby @entity70 , which he says is a dangerous highway			2
" this has nothing to do with racism or religious intolerance at all			1
it 's about a difference of opinion , and in @entity84 that 's ok , " said @entity56 , an @entity77 who said he has experienced racial intolerance in his life			1
these are just code words ... used to distract from the real issues , " he said			2
" if @entity90 was burying bodies in the water supply ... i would be equally concerned			2
" the water and soil concerns stem from the @entity3 center 's burying a body on the new property " without a casket or proper embalming , " @entity56 said			1
@entity100 , the @entity102 regional planning commission director , said thursday the center had permission before interring the body and it does n't appear any state regulations were violated			2
" generally , religious organizations are exempt from some rules , " @entity100 said			1
the center does not have approval for future burials and the planning commission has no plans to allow a cemetery on the grounds , @entity100 added			2
@entity117 , the spokeswoman for the group that organized wednesday 's counter-protest , @entity120 for @entity121 , disputed @entity56 's assertions			0
" no one marches to a courthouse to deliver a petition based on traffic concerns , " she said			1
the @entity128 page for @entity130 ' group says , " we , as tolerant and loving community members , come together to defend the right of any member of our community to worship and express his , her , or their faith no matter the religion			0
we will not stand idly by while @entity140 people in our community are represented falsely and assaulted on a psychological level			1
" while some of the marchers may have been inspired to protest by the water , soil and traffic concerns , " from signs being held and things supporters said , it was evident that was not the driving force			1
it 's a result of @entity153 and misinformation about local @entity3 community , " @entity130 said			0
@entity56 said his " group of concerned citizens " is focused on stopping the new facility from being built			0
he has filed a grievance against the @entity160 , claiming that commission failed to provide adequate public notice on the internet when it was considering the @entity10 's site plans			1
@entity100 said the commission has been cleared of any violation of open meeting requirements			0
@entity100 said that since the @entity169 offered site plans for approval that did n't involve rezoning , the commission only was legally bound to post a notice in a general circulation newspaper , which it placed in the @entity176			0
the commission has placed its notices in the @entity176 for the past two years , after years of posting them in @entity4 's larger @entity180 , @entity100 said			0
he said the change was made in an effort to save taxpayer dollars			1
@entity100 admitted the commission did n't make any mention on its website of plans to discuss the @entity169 at its may 24 hearing , and said he was n't sure why that information was never posted online			0
but he said internet postings are a " courtesy we have n't been doing all that long , " not a legal requirement			0
" we followed our protocols and feel that we did it according to the letter of the law , " @entity100 said			0
but @entity197 , campaign manager for @entity199 congressional candidate @entity198 , said that the commission did n't do its due diligence scrutinizing the @entity3 center 's funding and ties , rushing the process through			0
earlier this week , @entity198 called for a " clean accounting and thorough investigation " of individuals involved with funding the proposed @entity3 center and expressed concerns that one of the center 's board members had hate speech on his @entity216 page and supports @entity217 , which the @entity84 has designated a terrorist group			1
@entity0 affiliate @entity41 reported that @entity3 leaders said a board member has been suspended while they investigate the hate - speech claims			0
" @entity198 was on the planning commission until she ran for @entity225			0
these are things she herself would have looked into more , " @entity197 said			0
@entity198 is running in the august 6 primary			0
on the @entity236 side , candidate @entity230 , a @entity231 and veteran of the @entity234 war , has criticized @entity198 's position on the mosque , saying she and other local leaders are using fear to divide the community			1
" what do we have to be afraid of ? during my deployments around the world , i have worked , trained , and broken bread with @entity140			0
... the people that want to build a house of worship in @entity4 are not the enemy , " he was quoted as saying in a june 18 story published in the @entity180			1
repeated calls to the @entity10 were not immediately returned thursday			1
a statement on the center 's website said that 95 percent of the money for the project was raised locally , in middle @entity5 , in a three - month period			0
" this is the first step in multistage endeavor process that may last up to several year [ s ] based on our community 's growth and the fundraising , " the website said			0
the long - term plans for the new @entity169 call for a buildout to 52,000 to 53,000 square feet , but the first phase would be less than 10,000 square feet , @entity100 said			0
he said that because of the relatively small initial size of the center , he did n't believe traffic impact would be as bad as @entity56 expected , but added , " in 20 to 25 years it may be worse and we can re-assess			0
" @entity4 's population has spiked in recent years			0
it grew about 33 percent , from 68,816 people to 92,559 , between 2000 and 2006 , according to the @entity279			1
in 2000 , about 5 percent of @entity4 's populace was foreign - born -- almost twice the average in the state of @entity5 , the @entity279 said			0
@entity130 said the population influx may have sparked some xenophobia on the part of some residents , but she said it " helps enrich " the college town			0
@entity4 is home to @entity290 , which has an enrollment of 25,188 , according to the university website .			0
