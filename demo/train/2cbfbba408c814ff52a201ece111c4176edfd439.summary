@entity1 , @entity0 -- the humble mobile phone is driving a new revolution which some experts hope could bring fairer elections and democracy to some @entity9 states			1
during the 2006 local government elections in @entity12 , @entity10 used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw			1
many @entity9 countries have struggled against rigged elections and authoritarian rule since gaining independence last century			1
however , @entity9 observers say the growth of simple communication technologies like cell phones are assisting many states to progress towards open and fair elections in increasingly democratic systems			1
@entity12 is one of a number of @entity9 countries to hold successful elections by keeping voting and counting in check through independent communication			1
former @entity37 secretary - general @entity36 said many @entity9 nations now had a " very open society " and the increasing success of elections owed a lot to the existence of mobile phones			1
" with communication and cell phones , this is where it is difficult to cheat in elections now			1
you are announced at the district level and cell phones go wild so by the time you go to the capital , if you have changed the figures , they will know and you will be caught out			1
" according to experts , cellphones are particularly important for @entity9 due to a lack of some other technologies			1
visiting @entity9 political expert at @entity63 , @entity64 , said cellphones were much more accessible than the internet in most parts of @entity9 , and therefore had greater potential to influence transparency			1
" @entity70 provides groups in society with means to communicate , organize and obtain good information which is not controlled by government -- but , only a tiny percentage of @entity9 populations have access to internet			1
" just this month @entity2 reported dramatic increases in cell phone usage in @entity9 nations			1
in the @entity85 , for example , there are just 10,000 fixed telephones but cellphone subscribers have soared to more than a million in the last five years			2
@entity64 told @entity2 the key benefit of cell phones was that they allowed independent media , especially radio , to provide accurate coverage of elections and make it more difficult for ruling parties to cheat and get away with it			1
" during the 2006 local government elections in @entity12 , @entity10 used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw			1
i remember hearing one reporter describing how a local party boss was illegally taking a ballot box on his truck from the polling station			0
this was reported live as it was happening			0
" civilians and independent election observers outside the media have also taken advantage of cell phones to monitor elections			1
@entity116 , executive director of @entity117 , said the 2007 @entity119 election was another example of technology being used effectively			2
@entity116 described a technique of " parallel reporting " , whereby independent observers spread news of local vote counts and any irregularities			0
this technique was also used in the @entity130 elections this year , which he said caused @entity132 to delay announcement of election results			2
" parallel reporting was important in @entity130			0
it kept them from coming straight out and reporting a false result			0
" all of this technology is very important and gives a powerful new tool that cuts the ability for cheating , " @entity116 said			2
@entity64 said other computing technology , though more sparse , could also have a positive impact towards building democracies			2
he told @entity2 computers could be used to ensure parliament has access to national budget information and spending patterns , and in urban and rural communities they could provide citizens with data concerning the functions of the government and offer people an opportunity to contact their elected representative			0
despite the positive developments brought by cell phones and other communication technology , there have still been problems with numerous elections in recent years			1
@entity165 , associate professor at @entity166 , is wary about the potential of the technologies to make some situations worse			0
he said there could be both good and bad aspects to it			0
" the more transparency and the more information that can be circulated outside the hands of government is a good thing ... but the other side of that is that a lot of misinformation can get out that way also , " @entity165 said			0
although there has undoubtedly been positive progress with cell phone technology , most scholars and observers agree that pockets full of mobile handsets will not be enough to build stable democratic states and hold future fair elections			1
" it does n't mean anything unless you have all of the means of verifying the results			0
if you have a ruling authoritarian regime which is determined to cheat , they will do it , " @entity116 said			0
@entity64 sees the technology as necessary , but not sufficient for progress			2
" @entity9 have been able to organize without technology			2
freedom of association -- the right to organize autonomous organizations and function freely -- is more important than access to new technology in fostering democracy			0
" that said , new technology can be a powerful tool in improving communications between citizens and governments , between civil society organizations and the public			0
informed citizens are essential to good functioning of democracies , " he said			0
@entity64 said a number of other factors needed to progress before a state could move towards a more democratic model of governance			0
according to @entity64 these changes include : strengthening independent media ; growing and ensuring freedom of civil society ; decentralizing power , ceding more control to local governments ; empowering women ; improving judicial systems to ensure independence and power to punish			0
@entity64 said new technology could help achieve those goals to some extent , as communication was the key to overcoming oppression			0
" authoritarian regimes want to control and monopolize the flow of information			0
@entity9 authoritarian regimes do n't have the power and resources to completely control information disseminated through traditional means -- as oral communications are still the main means of disseminating information , " @entity245 explained			2
@entity64 said the changes being brought about by cell phones and other communication technologies could well play a part in bringing more participatory governments to the continent			1
" new technology is not a panacea , but it can speed up processes of democratization and should be encouraged , " he concluded .			2

election processes are being checked with the help of cell phones
cell phones are more accessible to @entity9 than the internet and telephones
technology could help push more countries towards democratic models
experts agree more than technology will still be required to see change
