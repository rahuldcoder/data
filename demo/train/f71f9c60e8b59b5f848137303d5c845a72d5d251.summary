there is never a day where at least one person is n't outside the @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 sitting or standing near an anemic tree , the only place for a bit of shade			0
at night , the crowd tends to swell , and the protest grows more intense			0
there are almost always two or three people streaming events live			0
you can hear them loudly sharing thoughts or giving a play - by - play of what 's happening			2
while their cameras capture live images , they call out what they think are injustices surrounding the august shooting of @entity26 and the subsequent police crackdown on protesters in the 10 weeks or so since @entity26 was killed by @entity3 police officer @entity29			1
the police are geared up with cameras as well			2
they wear body cameras , and any time officers approach protesters there is usually at least one officer with a handheld camera , too			0
it 's a careful dance in which protesters and police are trying to make sure they have proof if a law is broken or someone 's civil rights are violated			1
both outside the police department , and roughly 2 miles east -- along the main protest route , where most of the imagery of the sometimes - violent protests has originated -- tension can go from zero to 100 in seconds on any given night			1
police can tally dozens of arrests a night since the city erupted			1
among those placed in cuffs were journalists , clergy , a local rapper , a state senator , a @entity61 alderman and activist / intellectual @entity62			0
it 's tough to predict the mood each night			2
on tuesday , a small group of about 50 protesters caused no disturbances , and there were no arrests , police said			1
the next night , five police officers were assaulted with rocks , water bottles and a metal rod as demonstrators blocked traffic and knocked down barricades outside the police department			2
protesters , many of them increasingly suspicious of a recent spate of leaks surrounding the @entity26 investigation , say there will be more nights like wednesday than tuesday should a grand jury not indict @entity29			1
recovery in progress on @entity90 , where thousands of protesters have marched for months chanting things like " hands up , do n't shoot , " buildings still bear the scars of the community 's frustration			2
at businesses such as the @entity99 and @entity101 's bbq , plywood slats sit where windows once stood before violent elements among the protesters looted and vandalized businesses along the corridor			2
the @entity107 that was one of the first businesses attacked still lies in shambles , a chain link fence protecting it from further damage			0
@entity113 , a @entity114 - based author and pastor who grew up in @entity61 , has been participating in the protests			2
he has been arrested twice			0
as he walks by the burnt - out convenience store just a few blocks from where @entity26 died , he says , " democracy is on fire , and we 're called to be firemen			0
" asked to elaborate -- is he all right with the looting and burning ? -- he says he 'd prefer that the protests unfold without the violence and destruction			0
" i mean , it is not my preference , no , " he said			0
" i 'm more concerned about the conditions that produced this -- the simmering poverty , the simmering oppression , the simmering alienation , the existential crises that black youth feel in @entity138			0
i am far more concerned about the condition that produced the burning of buildings			0
" " our children are in a tremendous amount of pain			0
" tinderbox awaiting a match ? it appears @entity3 will not imminently simmer down , and a group called @entity149 hoped to grow the demonstrations with a " national day of action against police brutality " on wednesday			0
many protesters are preparing for the possibility that the grand jury may decline to indict @entity29			1
if that 's the case , one protester told @entity160 this week , " excuse my @entity161 , all hell is going to break loose			1
" that has been a pervasive sentiment since the protests began : many in @entity3 do n't care about reports that a scuffle preceded the shooting and that @entity26 may have reached for @entity29 's gun			1
the only facts that matter , they say , is that @entity29 shot perhaps as many as 11 times , hitting @entity26 six times above the waist			2
the fatal shots came as he stood roughly 30 feet away from @entity29 's police cruiser , and , according to some witnesses , with his hands up in surrender			1
it 's an unnecessary use of force , say many residents who feel @entity29 aimed to kill , not arrest , @entity26			1
@entity182 , a 27 - year - old mother of two who lives a few blocks from the @entity186 subdivision where @entity26 died , said in august , when the protests were at their ugliest , that she did n't care what @entity26 did before encountering @entity29			1
" jaywalking ? smarting off ? stealing cigars ? running ? you 're not supposed to die for that , " she said			0
her neighbors , @entity194 , 22 , and @entity195 , also predicted during august interviews -- days after a grand jury started hearing evidence in the case and the @entity200 announced an independent investigation -- that the turmoil in @entity3 would only worsen if @entity29 was n't indicted			1
" if this police officer do n't get no kind of charge , " said @entity195 , 41 , a nurse , shaking her head , " they think it 's chaos now ? " calculated leaks ? in recent days , the @entity209 received information from a federal source and the @entity212 was given @entity26 's autopsy report and spoke to a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
the @entity217 , meanwhile , reported that at least six black witnesses gave grand jury testimony that supported @entity29 's side of the story			1
the proceedings in a grand jury inquiry , by law , are not supposed to be made public , and @entity138 attorney general @entity225 has told his staff it 's " inappropriate and troubling " that information is trickling out while the grand jury and federal investigations are ongoing			1
he further said that the " selective flow of information coming out of @entity4 " is diminishing his faith in local authorities , a @entity200 official said			0
prosecutor @entity236 and @entity29 's defense team released separate statements thursday saying they were not the sources of any of the leaked information			1
sources have confirmed to @entity160 the information provided to @entity244 and @entity212 is part of the testimony being considered : that @entity26 's blood was found on @entity29 's uniform and inside his police car and that one of the wounds @entity26 suffered was a close - range gunshot to his hand after attacking @entity29			1
" we are not surprised by the information leaked last night by the @entity259 's office , " @entity26 family attorney @entity254 said in a statement			0
" several independent witnesses indicated there was a brief altercation between @entity26 and officer @entity29 at the patrol car			2
what we want to know is why officer @entity29 shot @entity26 multiple times and killed him even though he was more than 20 feet away from his patrol car ; this is the crux of the matter ! " peruse @entity269 , and you 'll find that many believe the leaks -- along with gov. @entity274 's announcement this week of a @entity275 to study social and economic conditions -- are harbingers of the grand jury declining to indict @entity29			1
" feeling in @entity3 among protest leaders is that leaks are coming from law enforcement in attempt to signal that no indictment coming , " tweeted @entity279 , a @entity217 reporter who was detained in the early days of the protests			1
on monday , @entity287 's former police chief , @entity286 , told local radio station @entity288 that it is " probably very unlikely " that the grand jury will indict @entity29 and the leaks are a calculated effort " to start getting some of the facts out there to kind of let people down slowly			1
" a former federal law enforcement official said something similar			0
" it could be really for , in part , a beneficial purpose , to start leading those community leaders and those leading the protests to believe that there wo n't be an indictment , " said @entity297 , former assistant director of the @entity298			2
lack of faith in system @entity309 lives in @entity61 and is the director of racial justice at @entity312			0
she has been taking part in the protests and notes it 's a young people 's movement and that @entity26 was the unfortunate catalyst in a " seminal moment for change			2
" she remains concerned , however , about what might happen in this @entity61 suburb of 21,000 if the grand jury decides not to indict @entity29			1
" i think we are all worried , " she said			0
" as a mother of three sons and a daughter , i also worry that if we do n't end this that i will be sharing a fate just like @entity26 's mom			0
" asked during a news conference if he , too , was worried that @entity3 could erupt if the grand jury comes back with a no bill , @entity274 said tuesday , " when you have this level of energy and when you have what has happened over 73 days , you can rest well - assured that we are focused and concerned about what could be the most problematic scenarios			1
" despite the assurances from government officials , the statements ring hollow to protesters like @entity113			0
" the only words that would have mattered , that could have possibly began the process of some symbol of justice , is the creation of a special prosecutor or the announcement of the indictment of @entity29 , " he said			1
he also has his doubts about assertions that the case is traversing the justice system and that citizens should have faith as it runs its course			0
" this justice system ? " @entity113 asked			0
" which has a wonderful set of facts to support the way it has engaged police who have taken black lives ? this justice system ? " complete coverage of @entity3 shooting and protests			2

despite 10 weeks of *unrest* , tuesday protests *peaceful* ; no arrests reported , police say
still , city remains tense as possibility looms of grand jury not indicting @entity29
residents , *ex-law* enforcement : leaks in case harbinger calculated effort to prepare city
residents : if there 's no indictment , protests thus far will pale compared to what 's coming
