@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity7 still had been researching and developing cleaner , more environmentally - friendly wood - burning stoves for almost two decades when , while working for the @entity5 @entity4 , he spotted a coal stove for sale on a street corner near @entity12 , @entity13			1
workers at @entity15 prepare wood - burning stoves for firing			1
he had been looking for an established manufacturer who could mass - produce the more efficient , lower - emission stoves he had been developing with the @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , a non-profit research and education center based in @entity25 in the @entity5			1
it had all the components , " still told @entity2			0
" i knew we could change it to a wood - burning stove			1
there was a cell phone number on the side , so i called it			0
" @entity36 of @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , based over a thousand miles away , answered			0
the two met and a short time later , in august 2007 , an agreement was signed between @entity22 and @entity15			2
@entity36 's factory began producing the new wood - burning stoves last year			2
last week , the two companies were declared " @entity42 " by the @entity43 at a ceremony in @entity1 , @entity0			0
the vast majority of the 60,000 stoves they 've sold since entering their partnership have gone to @entity49 , a @entity5 - based non-profit organization which markets the stoves in @entity51 , supported by the @entity52			1
others are sold in @entity54 , @entity55 , the @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
@entity36 said : " we have produced coal stoves for many years , and it is wonderful to be able to use our experience to make a wood stove that brings benefits to so many people			1
" the pair won $ 65,000 to develop the scheme which still says will be spent on research and development , and to employ more sales people			0
" what i 'm doing now is talking to the @entity73 , to relief agencies , just anybody in the world who might have an interest in burning wood more cleanly , and using less of it , " he said			1
the principle behind the stove is simple			0
with a better insulated combustion chamber , the fire requires less wood and burns hot enough for the smoke to combust as well , which means far fewer emissions			2
according to the @entity90 , about half the world still cooks with biomass or coal , using open fires or traditional stoves			0
the resulting emissions cause indoor air pollution , leading to pneumonia , chronic respiratory disease and lung cancer			0
this indoor air pollution causes 1.6 million deaths a year , primarily among children and women			0
the emissions also contribute to climate change , and the collection of firewood contributes to deforestation and erosion			0
@entity22 say tests performed on the stoves indicate major breakthroughs for both the environment and health in the developing world			2
the stoves reduce the use of wood for fuel by up to 50 percent , and cut carbon monoxide emissions by up to 70 percent compared to a traditional fire .			1

@entity5 research center , @entity13 stove manufacter *win* joint environment award
they make stoves that use less wood , reduce carbon monoxide emissions
since 2007 , they have sold 60,000 stoves in @entity51 , @entity54 and @entity55
currently talking with the @entity73 and relief agencies about potential deals
