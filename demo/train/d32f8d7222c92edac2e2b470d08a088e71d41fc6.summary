" we 're pleased with the pace and thoroughness of this investigation , which continues on today , " @entity3 said at the time			0

whether it leads us to anyone else remains to be answered			0
" he declined to take questions or comment further , saying , " this case will be tried in a court of law , " and not in the media			0
the lawyer for @entity6 ' wife , @entity48 , said @entity49 is " thrilled " by the prosecutor 's decision			1
" he ensured us that he would only make a decision based on the evidence , not based on public opinion , " @entity48 said in a statement to reporters wednesday			0
" while we are relieved with his decision , it was a calculated one			0
" the decision suggests that " @entity3 does not agree with the police department 's first public statements that this was a case that would shock everyone 's conscious , " @entity48 said			2
" as far as my client is concerned , she has known from the beginning and she is thrilled with the district attorney 's decision not to seek the death penalty because it affirms what we 've been saying all along , " he said			1
" this was just a tragic accident			0
when the truth comes out , justice will prevail for @entity76			0
" lawyer : @entity49 passed polygraph test the other five charges @entity6 faces are : first - degree cruelty to children , second - degree cruelty to children , criminal attempt to commit a felony ( sexual exploitation of a minor ) and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors			1
the criminal attempt to commit a felony and dissemination of harmful materials charges are not related directly to @entity29 's death			1
they involve allegations that @entity6 requested a nude photo of a minor 's genitalia and sent the same minor descriptions of " sexual excitement and sexual conduct , " according to the indictment			2
a @entity1 detective testified at an earlier probable cause hearing that while @entity29 was in the car at his father 's workplace , @entity6 was sexting with numerous women and sent one of them , who was underage , a photo of his erect penis			1
@entity6 ' attorney , @entity117 , called the charges excessive , describing them as a part of the " state 's maze of theories			1
" " it was always an accident			0
when the time comes , and we 've worked through the state 's maze of theories at trial , it 's still going to be a terrible , gut - wrenching accident			1
and all the eccentricities and moral failings of @entity76 ' life is n't going to change that , " he told reporters			0
@entity137 apparently wrote ' i 'm harmless ' on @entity140 profile according to the indictment , the grand jury found that @entity6 " did unlawfully , and with malice aforethought , cause the death of @entity145 ... by placing said @entity145 into a child car seat and leaving him alone in a hot motor vehicle			1
" authorities have painted @entity6 as a terrible father who , after admittedly looking up online how hot a car needed to be to kill a child , purposely strapped his son into his sweltering suv to die			1
his motivation ? the prosecutor has characterized @entity6 as an unfaithful husband who wanted a childless life			2
@entity117 has argued his client tragically forgot his child in the car			0
friends describe @entity6 as a doting dad , not a malicious one , who loved to show off his blond , bright - eyed boy and talked about him incessantly			0
@entity6 left @entity29 in a rear - facing car seat in the back of his 2011 @entity167 on june 18 while he spent the day at work as a web developer for @entity171 - based @entity170			2
he normally dropped the boy off at day care			0
