-- i am proud to be @entity2			2
i am also proud to be @entity3			0
in fact i define myself as a @entity3 @entity5			0
this means i am happy to support @entity2 in football matches , support @entity8 at the @entity9 and support @entity5 in the @entity11 golf tournament			0
when you write this all down , it looks a little complicated , but in practice millions of people do this every year in the @entity3 with no problem -- some supporting in the way i do , some supporting @entity20 , others @entity21 , and so on			1
i love the vibrant , tolerant , diverse , confident , nation that the @entity3 now is			0
in so many places i travel to in the world , people are struggling to find a way of working together , but we 've developed this character and human skill over three centuries in our @entity3 : it is a precious thing and worth standing up for			0
with just days to go , on september 18 , @entity20 will vote on whether it wants to stay in the @entity3 family or leave to form a separate country			1
it 's a huge decision , especially for those in @entity20 but also for everyone in the rest of the @entity3			1
whatever the result of the referendum , it will have a resounding impact on all of us -- how we see ourselves , our culture and our future			1
i feel it would be for more positive for @entity20 to remain an important and integral part of the @entity3 and i wanted to say so publicly			1
that 's why i am happy to support the " @entity54 " campaign to say to everyone in @entity20 just how much we do appreciate them being part of the @entity3 family			1
the campaign brings together a wide and diverse group of people from all walks of life -- both famous and not -- to show @entity20 just how much we do care			1
the @entity3 would feel a deep sense of loss if @entity20 left @entity64			2
you could ask , why should an @entity2 person have any views on this ? well as a member of the @entity3 , i feel i have the viewpoint of a fellow @entity3 family member			0
also , i have performed in most major towns and cities across @entity20 and i ran eight marathons through @entity20 holding the @entity75 , the flag of @entity20			2
and it 's not just me			2
there are millions of people in the @entity3 who feel like this , who care about @entity20 and want it to remain within the union , but whose voices have n't been heard			1
of course , i fundamentally believe in the right of those in @entity20 to determine their own future and will fully respect the decision , whichever way the vote goes			2
but it 's also true that everyone else in the @entity3 will also find big changes in their lives , and i think it 's important that we think about our combined goals and future			0
to my thinking , @entity20 can have the best of both worlds : it can have its own parliament , its own strong voice and its own cultural identity			1
and at the same time it can also have the strength , the security and the stability of being within the @entity3			0
at the @entity111 , the whole of the @entity64 team was fighting so hard to win medals and had such a positive spirit			0
if @entity20 leaves , we 'll never have that again			2
there are very strong economic reasons for staying together , but there is something even deeper that binds @entity2 and @entity20			1
it 's like a beautiful and long - lasting relationship			0
we 've overcome a lot to get where we are , we do care about each other despite our tiffs , and i believe the future is much better with us working together			0
we do amazing things when we 're together and i ask anyone who feels the same to visit letsstaytogether.org.uk			0
