-- some 100 years ago , a woman in @entity2 or @entity3 in @entity4 or @entity5 , @entity6 , might have awakened at dawn , while her young children slept , to prepare for her first shift at a nearby munitions factory			0
her husband , off fighting in @entity13 , had left her to test the limits of her own physical ability , as she provided food , shelter , warmth for her family , sometimes confronting great physical danger at work -- perhaps , for example , hanging suspended to load powerful explosives into the shells that other women had produced			1
when her work day was done , she went looking for food to buy , often standing in line for hours for scarce basic goods , scrounged for hard - to - come - by fuel to feed the furnace and cooked dinner			0
she washed the children , put them to bed , cleaned up and wrote a letter to her husband , keeping her worry off the page , before sleeping a few hours			0
and then she got up and did it again			0
a century ago , as nations and empires began mobilizing to send 65 million men to war , millions of women across the globe moved to fill in the holes created in civilian society			1
from @entity48 to @entity49 to @entity50 , across the @entity51 and @entity52 and @entity53 and @entity54 , women would become single heads of household in unprecedented numbers			0
they would serve directly on the battlefields as nurses and ambulance drivers and cooks			0
yet they also had to keep their nations ' home fronts running , moving into " men 's " jobs , from smelting iron , to driving streetcars , to plowing fields -- as well as working to administer new public and private organizations in support of the war			1
how a century - old war affects you the war changed life for women , and it changed the women themselves			1
when men returned from war , they inevitably tried to reassert their dominance in family and society			1
but their own broken conditions and circumstances at home challenged these attempts			0
women once again had to navigate a tricky terrain laid by men			2
yet women had displayed to the world and to themselves their competence in " total war			2
" indeed , the war created a lasting legacy for women , marked by new political rights in many countries -- and marked also by widespread and enduring anxiety over rising feminine power			2
in 1914 , women were not new to the paid workforce			0
individual industrial jobs were often considered as specifically for women or for men ; entire industries , such as textiles , were " women 's industries , " while men dominated in metal forges and machine factories			1
while wealthier women continued to shun paid work , by the turn of the century , lower - middle - class women had begun moving heavily into positions as clerks and secretaries , and women remained central to farming labor			2
but with the declaration of war , economic shifts and official pressure pushed them increasingly into war production and into " men 's " jobs ( even as , in @entity4 , authorities contradicted themselves and confused women by urging them rather to stay at home and have more babies )			1
if only 170,000 women in @entity48 worked in metal factories on the eve of war , by its end in 1918 , there were nearly 600,000			2
in the @entity51 and @entity48 , women confronted wartime shortages of food and housing			0
as they took on jobs outside the home , many relied on irregular child care or were forced to leave children without care			0
while , as in other combatant countries , @entity147 women generally strove to " do their part " for the war effort and accepted official assignments of war - related work , from factory work to food distribution , some balked at having to " register " with authorities			1
how @entity13 gave us ' cooties ' @entity161 propaganda posters declaring soldiers ' dependence on female munitions workers gave women a sense that their labor contributions would be important and acknowledged			1
yet , even as women munitions workers faced heavy labor and harsh conditions -- along with danger such as in the @entity173 explosion of 1916 near @entity174 , @entity175 , that killed 35 -- others condemned them for the relatively high wages they earned			0
it was a reflection of class tensions raised by the restructured wartime economy and women 's role in it			1
@entity161 authorities offered small " separation allowances , " subsidies to soldiers ' families based on the loss of income , and in turn assumed the right to check up on soldiers ' wives , to make sure they were not drinking or sleeping with other men			2
a woman who followed her own factory shift with dancing or a quick drink at the pub confronted public accusations of being a " flaunting flapper " or an " amateur girl " -- effectively a prostitute -- even as fellow male workers and soldiers on leave might proposition and harass her			2
some women felt new " freedom " during the war ; others saw changing " moral standards " as the result of women who had seen their men " swallowed up in that ever - increasing wave of death ... " in continental @entity52 , where the war was actually fought , conditions on the home front were even more challenging			1
many women took on " men 's work " to support the war effort and to ensure their families ' survival but also found themselves subject to still more controlling government policies that came with " total war			1
" women living in captured territories suffered added misery , billeting and serving often abusive foreign soldiers			2
the ' bionic men ' of @entity13 in @entity235 , urban women were effectively drafted into agricultural labor			1
women farmers were , however , little mollified by this motley work force intended to substitute for missing men and draught animals			1
in @entity52 cities , women often stood in line for hours for a chance to purchase spoiled potatoes ; together with barefoot children , they tried to scavenge food and fuel from public parks , a practice that had become a full - time job in itself in @entity253 , a 1916 policy reserved scarce food supplies only for women who worked in munitions factories , as officials announced that " the entire remaining civilian population , including women , were to be militarized through this plan			0
" in the extraordinarily frigid winter of 1916 - 17 , as schools shut down for lack of heat , the policy left few adults available to care for children			0
by the end of hostilities , the war had transformed women 's lives			1
in many warring nations , acknowledging women 's contributions became critical to warding off challenges to politicians ' own power in the tumultuous postwar conditions , across @entity52 especially			1
women won voting rights during hostilities or soon after in the @entity51 , @entity283 and @entity48 ; in the @entity284 and the new @entity286 republics ; and in the new states of @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290			0
economic rights were a different matter			0
demobilizing soldiers and groups claiming to represent them pressured officials and factory owners alike to " make room " in the workforce for returning men by laying off all women although women frequently remained the only potential earners in their households			2
this was one manifestation of powerful and contentious culture wars over the desirability and even possibility of returning to some halcyon past -- one that , like today , was in part imagined			0
battles ensued across @entity52 and @entity147 societies over how to otherwise recognize women 's work during the war			1
should newly impoverished women receive government assistance on the basis of their wartime contributions or only as dependents of wounded or fallen soldiers -- or perhaps not at all ? in @entity48 , authorities shunned the arguments of women 's groups and deferred rather to claims of the need to put men back in their " proper " role of economic power , by retaining the wartime notion of benefits deriving only through the husband			1
in @entity253 and @entity6 , conversely , women were now in principle to have equal status , though the practice did not always follow the principle			0
the divided attitudes about the value of female work that informed these debates lingers today			0
the flood of some 50,000,000 men back home at war 's end in 1918 and 1919 also brought new tensions into family life			1
returning soldiers imagined home as a refuge of normality after the nightmare of war			2
yet men 's physical and psychological injuries often precluded any return to their prewar existences , as did the social and economic upheaval of these years			1
what was " normal " had of course changed for the women left behind			0
with their new roles and autonomy , they were often blamed for this world turned upside down			0
such gender conflicts lasted through the 20th century and beyond , like many other legacies of @entity13			0

@entity375 : @entity13 changed women across globe in ways that affect us today
she says they took up " men 's work , " supported home front and raised kids in privation
she says male society struggled with how to acknowledge women after war
@entity393 : family tensions returned with soldiers , still women got vote in many nations
