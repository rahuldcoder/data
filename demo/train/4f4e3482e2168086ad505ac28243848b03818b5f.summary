@entity0 -- " @entity2 -- @entity4 bem - vindos ! " -- meaning " hi , welcome ! " -- is a @entity6 phrase heard more and more these days at @entity8 's tourist spots			1
that 's because @entity8 is the top @entity11 vacation destination for @entity12 , who are taking advantage of a favorable exchange rate and low prices			1
@entity12 outnumbered all other international travelers to @entity8 in 2011 , up 41 % from the previous year , according to state tourism officials			1
and there 's no sign of this @entity12 invasion slowing down : the @entity21 projects 1.5 million @entity12 will visit the @entity11 in 2012 -- and most of them will head to @entity8			1
@entity23 are used to seeing @entity12 tour groups marching through outlet malls and theme parks , usually dressed in matching t - shirts in single - file lines behind their leader			2
these @entity12 tourists are usually loaded with cash and ready to clear the shelves of the name - brand outlets			2
that 's because even at regular price , many goods and services in the @entity11 are much cheaper than in @entity12 , where tariffs , taxes and transportation costs can mean higher prices			1
" we [ took ] about 15,000 passengers on shopping tours , and they on average spend about $ 300 to $ 400 each person , " said @entity42 , vice president of @entity43			0
and those were just the @entity12 tour groups visiting outlet malls and theme parks in @entity8 and @entity0			1
@entity42 says she expects her business to double in 2012			0
that could be a conservative estimate as the @entity11 plans to expand its global entry program , which aims to speed up the visa approval process for international visitors			1
president @entity57 announced the expansion of the plan last week at a news conference at @entity61 in @entity0 , @entity8			1
he said he hopes to make it easier for visitors from countries " with rapidly growing economies , huge populations and emerging middle classes " like @entity12 and @entity68 to visit the @entity11			1
he said he wants the plan expanded " this year			0
" he said @entity12 was " especially important for @entity8 " because it has " a huge population that loves to come to @entity8 ... but we make it too hard for them			1
" " we want them spending money here , in @entity0 , in @entity8 in the @entity11 , which will boost our businesses and our economy , " he said			1
it 's a long process for many @entity12 to get to the @entity11 : on average , people have to wait 76 days just to get an interview at the largest @entity11 consulate in @entity12 , in @entity83			1
and with only four @entity11 consular offices in a country that is bigger than the continental @entity11 , a lot of @entity12 trying to visit the @entity11 must travel long distances for their interview			1
as a result , many are opting to travel to @entity91 because the visa process is easier			2
@entity42 says her tour business depends on the @entity11 improving its visa process : " if they make it easier , it would be even more people coming here , " she said			1
on a recent afternoon at the @entity100 near @entity61 , one of the hottest - selling items among the @entity12 tourists is luggage			0
they buy the suitcases , then stuff them with recently purchased shoes , clothing , bags and electronics until the luggage is almost bursting at the seams			0
that kind of spending has translated into billions of dollars in revenue for the @entity11			0
in 2010 , @entity12 visitors spent nearly $ 6 billion on @entity11 travel and tourism - related goods and services , nearly 30 % more than the prior year , according to a report from the @entity21			1
it 's a trend that has been going on since 2003 and has , according to the report , " propelled @entity12 up the rankings to become the fifth largest international market for @entity11 travel and tourism - related exports			1
" @entity8 's retailers are n't the only ones getting an economic boost : many of @entity132 's numerous theme parks have also seen a large increase in @entity12 tourists			2
@entity61 says 2011 was a record - breaking year for @entity12 guests at its parks			2
as a result , @entity61 hired 54 @entity6 - speaking " @entity141 , " most of them from @entity12 , to assist @entity12 tour groups throughout @entity61 's parks			0
@entity0 has seen a steady increase in guests from @entity12 over the past five years , says @entity144 , senior marketing officer with @entity145			0
as a result , @entity145 recently launched a website in @entity6 , and @entity144 says the company is looking to expand its @entity6 - speaking employees			0
" we are offering classes for employees to learn the basics of @entity6 , " he said			0
@entity12 's economy is booming after a quick recovery from the global economic downturn , and a new class of @entity12 is traveling and spending money , giving @entity8 a much - needed economic shot in the arm , according to @entity161 , an economics expert at the @entity162			2
" there is an emerging middle class [ in @entity12 ] who has disposable income , " he said			0
only a few years ago , @entity12 tourists were not always welcomed by shop owners in @entity132 and @entity8 , a tour guide said			2
today , businesses are catering to these cash - laden @entity12 tourists			0
@entity12 are also investing in @entity8 's sagging real estate market , particularly in @entity8 , either for a vacation home or just as an investment			1
the prices in @entity175 are a bargain , compared with the prices in @entity12 , according to @entity175 realtor @entity178			0
" in @entity12 or @entity181 , high - end real estate is around $ 1,000 per square foot , while in @entity175 , you can find high - end oceanfront property , like the @entity185 , for only $ 500 per square foot , " said @entity178 , who gets 80 % of his business from @entity12			0
" @entity12 love @entity175 , the weather is similar to @entity12 , [ it 's ] very safe ... [ and there are ] daily flights from @entity12 to @entity175 , " he said			0
@entity191 from @entity181 , who owns two condominiums in @entity175 , agrees			0
" it 's kind of a vacation place for us , " he said			0
" of course @entity175 is a beautiful place , a lot of nice people around -- a lot of bodies ... it 's a nice place to hang out to have some fun			0
" while @entity204 is still the most popular second language in most @entity8 businesses , these days it 's becoming more common to hear , " @entity207 ! " -- @entity209 for " thank you , come again ! " @entity1 's @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			2
