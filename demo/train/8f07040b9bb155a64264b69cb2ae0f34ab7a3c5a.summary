-- @entity1 , it has been said , fears that " somebody will @entity4 him			1
" this extraordinary grammatical twist of the word @entity4 can not be found in @entity1 's recently published memoirs			1
it was used in several television interviews by col. @entity10 , the former chief of staff to @entity11 , to suggest that @entity13 's vice president dreads the possibility that he , like gen. @entity4 , @entity15 's late dictator , will be put on trial for crimes against humanity in a foreign land			1
in effect , ever since @entity4 was arrested in @entity20 in 1998 and spent the next year and a half fighting extradition to @entity22 to face charges of having ordered and condoned torture during his regime , ever since the @entity26 ( equivalent to the @entity28 @entity27 ) judged that it was valid to indict a head of state for human rights abuses in a country other than the one where those abuses had been committed , the specter of that decision and that fate has haunted rulers and former rulers everywhere			1
what terrifies @entity1 ( and perhaps should terrify his boss , @entity13 , as well ) is that one morning he will be sipping his @entity42 in @entity43 or strolling along the @entity44 in @entity20 or examining @entity46 's " @entity45 " in the @entity47 in @entity48 ( would he recognize @entity49 in that painting ? ) , only to be suddenly tapped on the shoulder and escorted to a nearby police station			2
politely , of course -- there would be no roughing him up , no extraordinary rendition , say , to @entity60 , certainly no waterboarding in @entity63 namo to get him to come clean , no one whispering in his ear , " if you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear			0
" and , after being booked , @entity1 would be brought before a magistrate to be informed that according to international law , he is indicted for authorizing torture ( he has acknowledged direct involvement in approving its use on prisoners detained after 9/11 ) , an activity that is condemned in a covenant that the @entity28 ratified in 1994			1
and then he will have the chance -- which none of his purported victims did -- of defending himself with attorneys and the possibility of cross-examining his accusers			0
it 's true that the former vice president can avoid all this unpleasantness by simply staying within the borders of his own land and never venturing abroad , except perhaps to @entity86 or @entity87 , nations that have not ratified the @entity89			0
what @entity1 can not avoid , however , is the universal shame and disgrace of being targeted and tainted by the word @entity4 , an infamy that , unfortunately , also soils the country where @entity1 was born and which now gives him refuge and offers him impunity			1
by refusing to investigate , let alone prosecute , members of the @entity13 administration who stand accused by many human rights activists of crimes against humanity , the @entity28 is telling the world that it does not obey the treaties it has signed or even its own domestic laws			1
it is declaring that some of its citizens -- the most influential of these citizens -- are beyond the reach of the law			0
it is joining a group of rogue nations that routinely torture and humiliate their prisoners and deny them habeas corpus			0
it is difficult to exaggerate how much this harms the @entity28 -- a country that throws out the window thousands of years of progress in defining what it means to be human , what it means to have rights due to the mere fact of being human			2
a country that flouts the @entity134 and destroys the legacy established by the fathers of @entity28 independence and violates the @entity89 charter that the @entity28 itself helped to create after @entity139 when the cry of " never again " rose from a wounded planet			2
a country that applauds the trial of @entity144 in @entity145 and scorns the torture chambers of @entity147 in @entity148 and deplores the massacres in @entity150 , but will not hold accountable one of its own elite			2
there is a way , of course , to be rid of this stigma and , also , to verify whether @entity1 's claims of innocence ( like those of @entity4 ) are valid			1
put @entity1 on trial in the @entity28 itself			1
let a jury of his peers decide whether , as he himself has stated , it would have been unethical or immoral " not to do everything we could " ( in other words , torture ) " in order to protect the nation against further attacks like what happened on 9/11			0
" examine publicly whether those " enhanced interrogations " were , in effect , necessary to keep @entity28 safe or if , on the contrary , they have endangered the country 's security by debasing its moral standing and creating more jihadists bent on new acts of terrorism			2
the last three words of the @entity184 that schoolchildren all across @entity28 recite each morning , their hands on their hearts before the flag , the words i spoke out as a child in @entity192 and carried with me into my many exiles			0
or justice for almost everybody			0
those oh - so - simple three words are stating that it does not matter how powerful you are , whether you were a tyrant such as @entity4 or a man such as @entity1 who was a mere heartbeat away from the presidency of the @entity28 , you can never be above the law			1
a word synonymous with humanity , all of it , every first and last one of us -- the ruler who commands millions and the victim screaming in the darkness for a reprieve from pain			0
if @entity1 really loved his country , he would demand that a grand jury be convened , he would want a world where the schoolchildren of tomorrow , his own grandchildren and great - grandchildren , can truly pledge that there will be justice for all			2
he would want to clear his name and never more see it even remotely associated with @entity4 , that thief , that traitor , that man who tortured his own people and lives on only in the annals of villainy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			0

@entity233 : @entity236 aide says @entity1 fears " somebody will @entity4 him "
@entity233 : @entity1 likely terrified of being tried for crimes against humanity for *ok'ing* torture
he says @entity4 *tag* would be shameful for @entity1 , debases @entity28 in eyes of world
@entity233 : @entity1 should face trial in @entity28 to show that " justice for all " has meaning
