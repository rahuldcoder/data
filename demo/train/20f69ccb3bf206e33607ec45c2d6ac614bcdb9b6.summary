-- " sometimes i ask myself , why me ? why did this have to happen again ? " says 31 - year - old @entity2 from the @entity4 township in @entity5 , @entity6			2
" but the problem is i could have got it anywhere , on the bus , in a taxi , in my work			0
" @entity2 has extensively drug - resistant tuberculosis ( @entity15 ) , a form of the airborne disease that is resistant to the four main groups of drugs used to treat it , meaning treatment can take years and requires alternative drugs that have more side effects			1
he 's had tuberculosis for more than two years but it 's not the first time he 's been infected			2
" where i stay , the environment is not right , it 's not clean			2
i could have got @entity15 there , or on the taxis we use as they never open the windows , " he says			1
@entity15 has long been known as a disease of poverty			1
dense housing , shared living space , poor ventilation , poor nutrition and poor healthcare systems are the prime conditions for the infection to spread , and thrive			0
this ancient disease was known as the " @entity43 " in 18th century @entity44 and still kills more than one million people a year globally			0
it 's a complicated disease with the potential to affect many parts of the body and it can remain latent in people for many years , leaving them unaware they are infected			2
the main active form of the disease affects the lungs ; if left untreated it can cause considerable lung damage , resulting in eventual death			0
' public health emergency ' after repeated exposure , @entity2 has extensive damage to his lungs , leaving him reliant on an oxygen tank as he receives his treatment from @entity62			0
the @entity63 plays a large role in treating @entity15 in @entity4 , one of the largest townships in the country			1
@entity2 is one of thousands of people who contract the extensively drug - resistant form each year and he makes a crucial point -- @entity15 is everywhere in @entity6 and is the leading cause of death			1
it 's estimated that up to 80 % of drug - resistant forms of the disease are now transmitted directly between people , rather than developing over time			1
" the disease has reached a public health emergency in @entity6 , " explains @entity76 , professor of medicine at the @entity78			0
" we treat half a million cases a year and today , the epidemic has taken a turn with drug resistance			1
we treat 8,000 cases of resistance a year and now a chunk of those have developed resistance beyond @entity15 -- incurable @entity15			1
" looking at the disease globally , in 2013 there were 72 cases of drug - resistant @entity15 in the @entity94			1
in 2012 there were 64,000 cases in @entity97 and 59,000 in @entity98			1
the more people and the closer their proximity , the easier the disease spreads			0
drug resistance can develop for a variety of reasons			2
for @entity15 , the origins lie in incomplete treatment regimens where people did not complete their course of antibiotics due either to poor health systems or personal preference or complacency			1
incomplete treatments mean the bacteria behind the disease -- mycobacterium tuberculosis -- have had some , but not full , exposure to the drugs prescribed to kill them , giving them the opportunity to mutate and become resistant			1
the result today is such vast resistance that in some settings , all known drugs have been rendered useless and these forms are now transmitting between people			2
" we now have patients who are therapeutically destitute , " explains @entity76			0
global problem the problem is now global			0
@entity15 has its highest prevalence in @entity134 , @entity44 , @entity98 and @entity97 , with the latter reporting cases of total drug resistance			1
but according to the 2013 @entity139 report from the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) , this extensive form of resistant @entity15 has been reported in 92 countries , and is likely to be in more			1
" it 's probably in every country , " says @entity142 , head of the @entity143 at think tank @entity144 and chair of the @entity146 in the @entity147			1
" the disease has spread internationally and is a real concern			0
" the 67th @entity152 took place last week and it approved a long - term global @entity15 strategy , including targets to reduce @entity15 deaths by 95 % between 2015 and 2035			1
also firmly on the agenda was the global concern of antibiotic resistance and the fear of many diseases becoming untreatable			0
the issue has been addressed by many public health organizations in 2014 and @entity142 believes @entity15 is a prime example of the problem and should be declared a public health emergency of international concern by the @entity168			2
but such a declaration is yet to be made			0
the man in charge of the controlling the problem globally is @entity173 , director of the @entity174 at the @entity140			0
" @entity15 is competing with hiv / aids as the number one killer among the infectious diseases , " explains @entity173			2
" there are about 450,000 new drug - resistant tb cases every year and this is the scariest part of tuberculosis as you are left with less options to treat people , many of which are toxic			1
" ' extraordinary measures ' @entity173 stresses that the epidemic may differ in different parts of the world but is very much an international issue			0
" @entity134 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity6 have about 60 % of the world cases , so if they do n't improve there is no way the world can progress , " he says			2
@entity173 is especially concerned about the increased rates of drug - resistant @entity15 seen in @entity199			1
" this scares us most because in that part of the world there is a lot of @entity206 and so it can become explosive and really spread and move fast as @entity206 amplifies the effect of tuberculosis			0
" the ability of @entity206 to suppress human immune systems enables tb bacteria to take over the body			0
the @entity140 strategy therefore is to target high - burden countries and improve the diagnosis and treatment of drug - resistant @entity15			1
because patients must take drugs for at least two years , getting them to stick with the treatment is essential , and transmission must also be controlled			0
not a simple feat. " this threat has to be prevented and when it does occur , extraordinary measures must be put in place to diagnose and treat to stop it spreading to others , " states @entity173			0
" it 's a real threat and has to be taken extremely seriously			0
" this story was partly supported by the @entity229			0

drug - resistant @entity15 is on the rise , with some strains immune to all major drugs
extensively resistant @entity15 reported in 92 countries but is likely to be in many more
about 450,000 new drug - resistant @entity15 cases reported worldwide in 2012
" it 's probably in every country , " says expert
