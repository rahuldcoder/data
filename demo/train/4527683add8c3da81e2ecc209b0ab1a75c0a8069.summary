it was one year ago thursday that @entity1 became @entity1			1
from that moment , @entity2 around the world asked the same question : " is he still a @entity5 ? " if someone becomes a pope , and therefore head of all catholic religious orders -- @entity12 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity2 and so on -- is he still a member of his religious order ? since then , that question been answered several times by @entity1 , who in gatherings with his brother @entity2 has spoken of " we @entity2			1
" beyond the @entity5 parlor game of " is he or is n't he ? " the @entity1 's @entity5 identity is a key way to understand this world phenomenon of a pontiff			1
in fact , many of the words and deeds that have so shocked the world flow naturally from his @entity5 background			2
let 's look at five : humility			2
is there anyone who has not noticed @entity1 ' humility ? his first public gesture as @entity1 was not to bless the vast crowd in @entity40 but to request the crowd 's blessing			1
a few days later , he turned down the traditional papal digs in the grand @entity44 in favor of a modest suite at a @entity48 guesthouse			0
just this week , a photo taken of members of the @entity48 staff on their annual retreat showed the @entity1 seated in their midst , along with the other bishops and cardinals , as just another person on retreat			2
humility of course is a @entity61 virtue , but it is also something that @entity64 , the 16th - century founder of the @entity2 , specifically asked @entity5 priests and brothers to embrace			1
there are three kinds of humility , @entity64 said			1
the first is exemplified by the person who does nothing immoral			0
the second is the one who , when faced with honor or dishonor , is " indifferent			0
" the third is the person who chooses the humbler path , to be more like @entity79			0
pope @entity1 exemplifies this " @entity80 of @entity58			1
" how to really measure the ' @entity81 ' poverty			0
@entity1 is the first @entity1 and the first from a religious order since 1831			1
that means he is the first @entity1 to have lived under a " vow of poverty " since the mid- 19th century			2
all priests are supposed to live simply , but members of religious orders take a specific vow of poverty			0
" @entity92 and eternal @entity93 ... " begins the @entity5 vows : in other words , members of religious orders make a promise to @entity93 to live simply			1
thus , for most of his adult life -- until he became a bishop and was released from that vow -- @entity1 owned nothing of his own			2
as all members of religious orders , he had to live on a strict budget			0
he had to turn into his community anything he earned and any gifts			0
he had to ask for cash for large purchases , such as a suit			0
this accustomed @entity1 to a simple life , which many find one of his most appealing aspects			2
it also heightened his compassion for people who live not in voluntary poverty , as he did , but involuntary poverty , as the poor and marginalized do			0
pope @entity1 had some longtime @entity121 scratching their heads when he appointed a group of eight cardinals to advise him and assist him in reforming the @entity126 , or central bureaucracy			1
the " @entity131 , " as the cardinals have inevitably become known , have already implemented changes in such complex areas as the @entity130			0
many wondered why the @entity1 did n't rely more on the heads of the specific @entity48 offices for this kind of close consultation			2
why were n't the " @entity131 " the prefects of the largest @entity48 congregations ? but to most @entity2 his " way of proceeding , " as @entity64 liked to say , was familiar			1
before becoming archbishop of @entity143 , @entity1 was the @entity5 " provincial , " or regional superior , of @entity144			1
as all @entity5 provincials do , he selected province " consultors " who advise the provincial on all manner of decisions			2
because they usually do not work directly in province governance , the provincial can rely on them to speak openly and candidly			0
with the " @entity131 , " the @entity1 is replicating the familiar @entity5 model of governance			1
often you will hear @entity1 say something similar to what he said in a homily recently to a parish in @entity162 when he asked parishioners to close their eyes and imagine themselves in a @entity166 scene , in this case at the @entity168 at the @entity169			2
" now speak to @entity79 , " he said			0
last @entity170 he asked listeners to picture themselves with the women disciples approaching @entity79 ' tomb on @entity174			0
this is a key characteristic of @entity5 prayer : asking the person to use their imagination and let @entity93 work through that			1
in homilies , reflections and speeches , @entity1 most often does not tell his listeners what to think , he invites them to imagine and think for themselves			2
it is not the @entity1 's @entity79 whom you are invited to meet , but your own			2
jesuits are asked to " find @entity93 in all things			1
" again , this is not simply a @entity5 virtue but a @entity61 one			0
yet that brief motto is the most commonly cited way of summing up @entity5 spirituality			0
and " all things " means all people			0
this includes those people who have felt excluded , or unwelcome , in the church			0
so although his message is based on simple @entity61 mercy , the world has witnessed the @entity1 repeatedly inviting the church to experience @entity93 in places that some other @entity209 leaders may have overlooked or even ignored			1
atheists , divorced and remarried @entity211 , and gay men and lesbians , have all seen the @entity1 reach out to them			0
@entity1 is not so much trying to find @entity93 there -- because he knows that @entity93 is already there -- as he is reminding others to look for @entity93 in the lives of all these people			1
other @entity5 hallmarks could be added to the list , such as flexibility , freedom and an emphasis on social justice			0
but overall , when @entity2 watch the @entity1 , we often nod our heads and say , " that 's very @entity5			1
" over the past year , @entity2 have been accused of being too proud of @entity1			1
so at the risk of pride , i 'll say that i think he 's a great pope , a great priest and a great @entity5			1
and i 'll bet @entity64 would be proud -- or as proud as he would allow himself to be .			0

@entity232 : jesuits wonder if @entity1 , when elected , was still a member of their order
@entity232 : he has identified with the @entity2 , and his life reflects the order 's *teachings*
humility , poverty , prayer and " finding @entity93 in all things " are @entity5 ideals , he says
@entity232 : pope @entity1 is a great leader who would please @entity64 , founder of @entity2
