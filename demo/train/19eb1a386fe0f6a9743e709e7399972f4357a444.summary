-- take a glass , fill it with marbles and shake			0
that 's what it can feel like inside an airplane hit by turbulence			1
recent @entity9 and @entity10 flights have both been hit by unexpected turbulence that resulted in injuries			1
a @entity9 flight bound for @entity15 's @entity14 last month experienced turbulence shortly after takeoff from @entity18 , sending five crew and passengers to the hospital			1
and five people were taken to a hospital tuesday after an @entity25 - to - @entity27 flight encountered turbulence during its initial descent , an @entity10 spokesman said			1
since 2007 , there have been 58 reported incidents of turbulence on @entity34 airlines , according to the @entity35			1
these incidents resulted in 64 serious injuries and 97 minor injuries , according to the @entity35			1
commonly experienced as bumpiness in flight , " turbulence is rapidly varying or overturning air motions occurring across short distances in the atmosphere , " @entity40 meteorology professor @entity39 said			2
turbulence can occur at any time on a flight , according to @entity49 , a meteorologist who appears on @entity0 and @entity50 and is the author of " @entity52 : a guide to surviving flash floods , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , snowstorms , @entity59 and @entity60			1
" there are several common types of turbulence			2
convective turbulence can occur when an aircraft passes over an unstable air mass ( perhaps near a thunderstorm ) and experiences rapidly rising or descending air , according to @entity49			2
mechanical turbulence can occur when an aircraft passes over a mountain range , hills or even large buildings			2
they bring " waves " of uneven airflow			0
wind shear or clear air turbulence can occur without warning due to changing movements and speeds of air at different heights			2
" because the air can be more unstable at lower altitudes , it may more typically occur as a plane is climbing upwards from taking off or descending to land , " @entity49 said			0
" also , since summer thunderstorms tend to occur often in the afternoon , you may find less ' bumpy ' flights in the early morning hours , " but it can happen any time , even at night , @entity49 says			1
capt. @entity93 is n't worried about what turbulence will do to his plane			2
planes are designed to withstand the pressure of the atmosphere in flight , even when it feels really bumpy , says @entity93 , chairman of the @entity103 air safety committee and a @entity9 captain with more than 20 years of flight experience			0
he does worry about passengers and loose galley items flying around during unexpected turbulence			0
do n't let turbulence freak you out one of the trickiest things pilots have to figure out is " when to turn that seat belt sign off after there 's been some turbulence and it 's been smooth for a period of time , " he said			1
" there 's no guarantee you 're going to have a smooth ride , and the onset of turbulence can be very quick			1
passengers really do need to rely on the judgment of the men and women up front			0
" we 've all heard the flight attendant announcements to fasten our seat belts on board airplanes , even when the seat belt sign is n't illuminated			0
that offers added protection to passengers , who can choose to follow the rules and buckle up			0
pilots often order flight attendants to sit down if they know turbulence is coming or it 's already hit ; otherwise , the flight attendants are moving about the airplane cabin to prepare the airplane for in - flight service and landing			1
you may not feel particularly fortunate in your cramped coach seat with not even a bag of peanuts to calm you down , but you 're luckier than the flight attendant pushing a drink cart during an unpredicted bout of clear air turbulence			0
that cart weights several hundred pounds , and the flight attendant has to secure it before buckling up , says @entity154 , an @entity156 spokeswoman			0
bruises , sprains and even broken bones are common among flight attendants , she says			0
so do what @entity39 does on a flight : " i just wear my seat belt , because i know it can happen at any time			1
" @entity0 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			0

turbulence can happen at any time , although it often comes during ascent or descent
64 serious injuries resulting from turbulence have occurred since 2007 , according to @entity35 figures
*staying* buckled up is a passenger 's best *defense* against injury
