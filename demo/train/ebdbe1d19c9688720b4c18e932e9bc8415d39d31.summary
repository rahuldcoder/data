@entity0 -- they could not say for certain who shot their loved ones in brutal gangland - style " hits , " but a series of witnesses captivated the courtroom -- and drove two jurors to tears -- thursday as prosecution testimony continued in the federal trial of reputed @entity0 mob leader @entity13			1
one witnesses , 63 - year - old @entity15 , alternated between bouts of crying and attempts to smile as she recounted the night she was in a car that suddenly was riddled by bullets , leaving her then - boyfriend a quadriplegic for the remaining three decades of his life			1
" i remember hearing this noise -- a continuous stream of noise of gunfire , ( like ) rocks being thrown ... it just was nonstop ... in retrospect it was a machine gun , " she said , describing the night she and her boyfriend were riding home with another man , @entity26 , after her birthday celebration at a @entity0 bar			1
when it was over , @entity15 recalled thursday , her boyfriend was " covered in blood and broken glass , eyes glazed over ... ( he ) let out a groan			1
" @entity15 said she reached over @entity26 , who was collapsed on the steering wheel , and laid on the horn until a taxi driver pulled over and called an ambulance			0
she learned only later that @entity26 was dead			2
" the police told me that they were concerned for my safety because they thought i might be a target because whoever the people who machine - gunned down the car probably did n't want me as a witness , " she said			2
@entity13 is charged in the deaths of 19 people during the nearly two decades that prosecutors say he was the head of the @entity59 mob in @entity0			1
he is also charged with extortion , racketeering and money laundering			2
the trial , now in its second week , has included prosecution testimony from a former hitman and @entity13 colleague who testified that he and @entity13 together carried out 11 killings			1
that witness , @entity68 , included in his testimony details about @entity26 's killing , with @entity68 saying he and his associates sprayed @entity26 's car with bullets thinking it was a gang rival target			1
jurors heard from @entity26 's brother , @entity77 who immediately began crying and asked to pause questioning while apologizing to the judge profusely			2
the night before his death , @entity26 had been at @entity77 's place showing off his new car , his brother testified			0
" he was very proud of it			0
" @entity77 said he heard on the radio the next day that his brother had been killed , and called home to verify @entity77 was in court monday when @entity68 testified about shooting at @entity26 's car			0
another witness , @entity88 , was stone - faced when she testified about the 1973 killing of her companion , @entity90			0
she was nine months pregnant with their child when he was shot and killed , she said , and she was unable to attend the funeral because she had given birth by then			0
@entity68 earlier testified that he , @entity13 , and their associates were involved in the killing of @entity90			2
an elderly , wisecracking @entity98 , fresh out of jail after serving 21 years for conspiracy to rob an armored card , testified that he barely survived the night @entity90 was shot			0
he told the jury he was getting " bad vibrations " about a car that was trailing the two of them after they had met at a bar with a man described earlier in @entity68 's testimony as a @entity13 associate			1
" i told @entity114 keep your eye on rear or side mirror and he said , " @entity111 , ai n't nobody gon na hurt us , " @entity98 remembered			0
then , @entity98 said , that trailing car sped up and a torrent of bullets came from it			0
he was hit eight times , @entity98 said , pointing out to the jury exactly where			0
but none of that emotional and colorful testimony put @entity13 behind the trigger			1
when defense attorneys questioned @entity15 about who was behind the shooting she survived , she replied , " what i say would only be speculation ... in my mind i do know , but that 's for me			0
" in the afternoon , the jury heard from @entity68 's former bookmaker , @entity137 , who testified that he paid " rent " to @entity13 and his associates , including @entity139 , in the amount of $ 1,000 a month for " law enforcement expenses , " as the gang called it			2
@entity137 was originally business partners with a man named @entity146 , who the @entity148 gang gunned down in 1973 , according to @entity68 's previous testimony			0
@entity137 skipped town after the murder of his partner , saying that " i felt in fear of my own life " and later returned when his brother indicated to him that " it was n't me they were interested in			0
" shortly after returning to @entity0 , @entity137 said , he was " asked " to team up with @entity13 , @entity68 and the gang , an offer @entity137 said he had " no choice " but to accept			1
jurors are expected to hear testimony friday on @entity13 's alleged " informant " file , a document the prosecution claims proves that he was protected by the @entity166 for providing information			1
according to previous testimony , it was a rogue @entity166 agent now jailed who tipped @entity13 off to his 1995 indictment , a tip that allowed him to go into hiding for 16 years before he was captured in @entity175 with his girlfriend in 2011 .			1
