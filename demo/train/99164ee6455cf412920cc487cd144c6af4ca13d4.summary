@entity0 , @entity1 -- the wife of an @entity6 man missing since a reported pirate attack on a @entity6 - @entity5 border lake said thursday it 's " hard being judged " by people who have questioned her story , but " i know what happened that day			1
" @entity13 told authorities her husband @entity15 was shot and killed by pirates on @entity17 during a sightseeing trip last week			1
his body has yet to be found , leading to questions about the accuracy of her account			2
but @entity13 told @entity26 's " issues with @entity25 " on thursday that " i know what i know			1
" " it 's hard being judged and thought of that i might have done something to him , " she said			2
but she added , " as long as i know the truth , @entity32 knows the truth			2
and other than that , it almost does n't really matter to me , because i know what happened that day			2
" @entity5 authorities said earlier this week that they could not verify the shooting , and @entity13 was asked point - blank on @entity41 's " today " show wednesday whether she had anything to do with her husband 's disappearance			1
@entity45 , @entity46 's mother , said tuesday that any suggestion that her daughter - in - law 's account was inaccurate is " insane			0
" investigators have found some evidence that backs up @entity13 's account , including blood on her life vest , @entity56 , @entity1 , sheriff @entity50 said thursday			1
and the incident was similar to other attacks reported by boaters on @entity17 , about 70 miles west of the @entity13 's home in @entity61			1
@entity50 has said the gunmen are typically teenagers hired by a drug cartel in the neighboring @entity5 state of @entity65			1
@entity5 authorities have said the lake is controlled on their side by " organized criminals , " and the sheriff called on the @entity71 cartel to turn over @entity13 's remains if they have them			1
" we just want a body , " he said			2
@entity13 said she believes the attackers took her 30 - year - old husband 's body after he was shot in the head and fell off the personal watercraft he was riding			1
she said she suspects her husbands ' remains are more likely to have been dragged onto land than to have been left in the lake			0
" we do believe if they would just go ahead and give us @entity15 's body back , it would be done			2
we could go on with our lives , " she said			0
authorities from both nations are conducting separate searches and are coordinating and holding regular meetings , @entity93 spokeswoman @entity92 said			1
but because the alleged crime happened on the @entity5 side of the border , the @entity6 can not prosecute or make arrests in the case , the sheriff said			1
@entity13 , 29 , told @entity26 that the couple set out across the lake on personal watercraft for a sight - seeing trip to @entity108 , a half - submerged ghost town on the @entity5 side of the lake			1
though there had been warnings about previous robberies on the lake , she said they had heard of no problems for several months , " so we figured eveyrthing had kind of calmed down			0
" instead , she said , they were pursued by men in three boats as they left the site 's historic church			2
at first , " they just waved at us like we were friendly , a very friendly wave , " she said			0
but then , as the couple passed , she said they began chasing them and firing shots			0
@entity46 was shot in the head and fell off his personal watercraft , and he was unresponsive when she turned back to try to retrieve him , his wife said			1
while she was trying to haul him onto her craft , their attackers pulled up alongside , she said			0
" they did n't say anything to me , so i do n't know what they were trying to do think or they were doing , but they left , " she said			0
" they just left me there			0
thankfully they did n't shoot at me			0
they had a gun pointed at me			0
" unable to pull her husband 's body out of the water , @entity13 headed back across the lake to @entity6 waters			1
she said the gunmen fired " a few more " times on her way back			0
" once i started to get going , i just went as fast as i could and did n't look back until i could n't see them anymore , " she said			0
a man who spoke to @entity2 on condition of anonymity this week said @entity13 appeared shaken and upset when she came ashore and asked him to call sheriff 's deputies			1
@entity163 , lead investigator for the @entity65 state police , described the area as " a conflict zone			0
" the state has made headlines recently as a hotbed for drug cartel violence , and there have been at least four cases of gunmen in @entity5 waters robbing or threatening boaters on @entity17 since april , according to the @entity176			1
@entity46 worked for an oil company in @entity179 , @entity5 , and the couple had lived on the @entity5 side of the @entity182 before moving back to the @entity6 earlier this year , family friends said			1
his aunt , @entity183 , told @entity26 's " @entity191 " the family had concerns about their safety in the area , " and we were all thrilled to hear that they were moving back to @entity189 , " where they grew up			1
" we 're all very devastated			0
it 's hard to even believe something like this could happen			0
we 're hanging in there , but it 's very , very difficult for the whole family , " @entity183 said			0
according to rep. @entity198 , @entity199 , 60 @entity5 personnel , three boats and a helicopter have taken part in the search			2
investigators resumed their work thursday despite threats to their lives , and @entity198 suggested that the @entity5 navy might need to be called in to help			2
despite the dangers on the @entity5 side of the lake , @entity1 officials on thursday said that the @entity6 side of the body of water remains safe			1
" it is just as safe now as any other time			0
however , there is a threat , " said rep. @entity219 , @entity199			0
@entity2 's @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0
