-- what 's the end game ? that 's what i want to know			1
it 's the question i ask , silently , every time i hear of a first grader going for extra academic tutoring ; every time one of my daughter 's friends is permanently unavailable for a play date because she has after - school ballet on monday , after - school theater on tuesday , after - school swimming on wednesday , after - school mathematics on thursday and after - school origami on friday			1
because i am a coward , i refuse to stop other parents and ask the question aloud			1
but it burns inside of me			2
i 'd like to know			2
what 's the end game ? or , put differently : what the heck are you trying to accomplish here ? back when i was a kid , growing up on the mean streets of @entity29 , @entity30 , we returned home from a day at school and did ( always in this order ) three things : first , we had a snack ( long story , but my mother hid the treats in the trunk of our ' 80 @entity40 , leaving my brother and me a choice of plain graham crackers , carrots or -- dear @entity45 -- homemade yogurt )			1
then , we did our homework			2
then , we played our asses off			1
motherhood and work , is it possible ? really , we did			0
we 'd meet up with @entity52 and @entity53 and @entity54 and @entity55 and @entity56 and @entity57 and a dozen other neighborhood kids and run			1
there were games of kill the carrier and tag and @entity65 - @entity64 and kick the can ; gleeful mile - long walks into town for bubble gum and soda			0
inevitably , as darkness fell , @entity54 's dad , @entity71 , would let loose a two - fingered whistle that shot up @entity75 's steep hill like a flamethrower			1
" time to go in , " @entity54 would say , and we 'd all leave for dinner			0
remarkably ( and against all modern parental logic ) , we 've all wound up doing just fine			0
married , kids , homes , careers , contentment			1
@entity54 is a designer for @entity83			0
@entity57 graduated from the @entity84			0
on and on and on			0
it came , to a large degree , naturally			0
just letting children be children			0
nowadays , however , i live in a community relatively similar to the place where i grew up , and nothing for kids is allowed to come naturally			1
pressure reigns , the air poisoned by a looming need to make certain — cost and logic and inanity be damned — that your child has been placed on the 100 - percent - guaranteed - or - your - money - back path toward success			1
it 's no longer enough to have @entity104 learning at his grade level			1
he has to be , testing-wise , one or two notches ahead ( @entity110 end result : a classroom of bored , poorly behaved tykes )			0
it 's no longer ok for @entity104 to have little to do after school , free time to use as he sees fit			1
no , now you 're either signing your child up for myriad organized activities , or you 've somehow allowed him to fall behind			0
everything revolves around success , success , success , success			1
but here 's the thing : what in the world is success ? opinion : hey , baby boomer parents , back off ! please , i would love someone to tell me			1
is it being a class valedictorian ? is it getting into @entity130 ? is it earning an mba or a ph.d. ? is it skating for the @entity135 ? going to law school ? joining an exclusive country club ? working for @entity138 ? dating @entity139 ? having your own reality tv show ? everyone is in such a rush to guarantee a child 's future , yet nobody has been able to rightly ( and righteously ) explain the ultimate reward			1
i 've heard people say , " i just want to give my child the best opportunity to succeed " at least 100 times , but always without elaboration			1
hell , many of the parents i see gunning hardest for said success are , quite frankly , unhappy			1
they either work 70 hours per week at a job they loathe or count the hours until the kids go to sleep , or they just generally long to be somewhere — anywhere — but here			2
it 's as if we 're all lined up on a racetrack , and we know we need to sprint as fast as possible — only there 's no discernable finish line			2
just run hard , expend all your energy , and maybe you 'll find it			0
fortunately , i have the solution			0
actually , it came from my wife			0
we were discussing which so - and - so teacher would best suit my son 's so - and - so needs			2
" you know what i want ? " she said			0
" what ? " " i want him to have fun			2
" " in school ? " " yes , but also in life			0
" i could n't agree more			0
kids are gifted with 18 years of childhood			2
that 's it — less than two decades before the cruel , dark , real word overtakes their bliss			2
yes , i want mine to do well in school , and learn the virtues of compassion and empathy and hard work			0
but i also aspire for them to jump on our trampoline until their legs sag from exhaustion , and ride their bikes up and down the street until someone lets loose a loud whistle , and play tag next door in @entity203 and @entity205 's yard and chase down the ice cream man and watch in amazement as the pink petals fall from our cherry blossom tree			1
if they wind up at @entity211 , and they 're happy , i 'll be thrilled			0
if they wind up collecting garbage , and they 're happy , i 'll be thrilled , too			0
that 's my end game			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity219 says he 's baffled as to why people *schedule* their kids lives so much
he says *highly* *schedule*d lives for kids are supposed to lead to success ? he thinks not .
he says growing up , he and a cadre of friends played freely , were successful as adults
@entity219 : kids should play , grow , have fun without parents ' *interference*
