-- if you want to use @entity2 a little more like @entity3 , you might soon get your chance			1
the social - media giant is testing a feature that would let users set a time for their status updates to disappear			2
a @entity2 spokesman said the feature is part of a " small pilot " and is available only for certain people using @entity2 's @entity15 app. several users reported noticing the test on their iphones			1
one post on @entity20 showed a list of expiration options ranging from one hour to seven days			1
it 's not the first time @entity2 has tried to emulate emerging social media services designed to be used in the moment without leaving a permanent digital mark			1
in 2012 , @entity2 toyed with the concept with a standalone app , poke			2
apparently coded in part by ceo @entity32 himself , the effort was described as something of a lark over a holiday weekend			0
it was shut down this year and replaced by @entity37 , a similar app on which short - lived messages show up only once two users have sent them to each other			0
the ephemeral has become increasingly alluring in the social - media world , particularly among younger users , in the past couple of years			0
the runaway success of @entity3 , which lets you send photos , texts or videos that disappear in a matter of seconds , has led the way			0
the scheduled deletions on @entity2 , as being considered , obviously have a longer shelf life than a few seconds			0
users might also want to delete updates that would no longer be of use after a short time , i.e. " i 'll be in @entity61 until noon tomorrow " or " i have two tickets for tonight 's concert			1
who wants to go ? "			0

*facebook* users might be able to schedule expiration times for their posts
@entity2 says it 's doing a small test of the feature
delete times would range from one hour to seven days
