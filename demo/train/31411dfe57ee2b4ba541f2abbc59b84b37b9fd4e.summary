-- @entity1 and @entity2 continued their preparations for the first grand slam of the season with contrasting victories friday at tournaments in @entity9 and @entity10			1
world number one @entity1 has never won the @entity12 and stands just one match away from achieving that ambition			1
but he was fully extended by @entity16 qualifier @entity15 before prevailing in three sets			1
earlier , @entity2 dropped just two games on the @entity19 as he dismissed @entity20 6 - 1 6 - 1 in just 58 minutes to reach the last four			1
@entity1 , who is the only seed left in the tournament after the shock departures of @entity24 and @entity25 , could have been headed that way as he dropped the opening set to @entity28 , who had enjoyed a dream run to his first @entity31 semifinal			2
but the @entity32 hit back to level in typical style and closed out the match 4 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 3 in just under two hours			0
" the positive thing is i am in the finals the first week of the season without arriving here with big preparation , " @entity1 told the official @entity31 website			2
" without playing my best , i was able to find a solution			0
it 's true that i finished the match playing better than what i started , " he added			0
@entity1 is likely to have his work cut out in saturday 's final at the @entity49 , with @entity51 's @entity50 his opponent			2
@entity50 , something of a @entity9 specialist and twice a losing finalist , showed his quality with a straight sets 6 - 3 6 - 2 win over @entity58 of @entity16 in a little under an hour			1
he has twice beaten @entity59 in the same tournament and showed enough against @entity58 to suggest he could repeat the hat - trick			0
@entity2 is playing in @entity10 for the first time in his glittering career and treated the crowd on the @entity65 to a tennis master class against his @entity68 opponent			1
he was briefly troubled in the opening game , facing three break points then took firm control			0
the top seed will next play @entity51 's @entity73 , who beat another @entity68 , wildcard @entity74 , 7 - 5 6 - 4			0
the second semifinal will be between second seed @entity76 of @entity77 and home favorite @entity78			0
@entity76 ground out a three set win over @entity82 's @entity81 , while @entity78 continued his fine run with a straight sets dismissal of @entity87 qualifier @entity85 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 .			2

@entity1 into final against @entity90 at @entity12 in @entity9
