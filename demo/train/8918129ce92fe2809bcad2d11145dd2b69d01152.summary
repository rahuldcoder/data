-- with @entity2 pushing for a @entity4 spot in @entity6 's @entity5 , the @entity1 promised to be interesting			1
@entity2 had n't beaten @entity7 for about 20 years but has been a surprise package this season and possesses two of the league 's top strikers in @entity13 and @entity14			1
a striker did shine sunday , although it was @entity7 ' @entity17			1
@entity17 scored the only goal in the first half and @entity7 restored its nine - point advantage over @entity21 atop the division with a 1 - 0 win			1
@entity7 mostly stifled @entity2 as it extended its unbeaten spell in @entity5 to 17 games , though the visitor felt it should have gotten a penalty late in the game			1
@entity17 's effort in the 30th minute put the @entity30 tied first in the league scoring charts with the injured @entity32 and what a goal it was			2
he controlled a low , fiercely struck pass , turned and scored on a half volley from outside the box			0
" it 's one of the few times @entity2 were able to play against us with no pressure , thanks to the great campaign they are having , " @entity7 keeper @entity38 said in comments posted on the @entity41 website			2
" it was a real derby , quite an @entity49 style one with the referee letting the action run			0
" compliments to @entity2 , as their performance made it really difficult for us			2
in a complicated and balanced encounter like this , the difference is made by those moments of magic from a champion			0
we 've got several and today @entity17 was decisive			2
" veteran @entity62 international @entity61 celebrated with @entity17 and @entity61 was involved in the penalty claim in the 80th minute			2
@entity64 went down and @entity2 thought he was tripped but the referee allowed play to continue			2
@entity21 beat @entity67 1 - 0 on saturday			1
@entity68 ' relentless ' ' @entity69 ' was the headline used by the @entity72 's website after it crushed @entity73 96 4 - 0 and that about sums it up			1
@entity68 registered a 14th straight win in the @entity72 , has n't lost in the league in 47 matches and blanked @entity78 in the @entity4 on wednesday			1
@entity79 and @entity80 gave the reigning @entity82 champion a 2 - 0 lead at the break and @entity79 and @entity85 added strikes in the second half			1

" it felt good to be back in the starting lineup and not to have any problems , " he said			0
" i 'm feeling much better and my fitness is improving too			0
" @entity113 stutters not accustomed to competing in the knockout stages of the @entity4 , maybe @entity113 's 1 - 0 win at @entity115 last wednesday took its toll			1
an unusually sluggish @entity113 conceded three goals in the first half and lost 3 - 0 at relegation threatened @entity121 to miss a chance to join @entity123 on 63 points atop @entity126 's @entity125			1
" it was a good match for them in the first 25 minutes , " @entity113 manager @entity127 told his club 's website			0
" in the second half we lifted the team level and at least played the game			0
you can lose and would rather lose like we did in the second half			0
" it was a fine weekend for @entity123 , given @entity138 also lost saturday and remained on 60 points			0
