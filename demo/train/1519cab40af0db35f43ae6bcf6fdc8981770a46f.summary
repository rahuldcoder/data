-- crew members on a @entity3 - flagged ship learned friday that their questioning by @entity6 investigators in an arms trafficking probe has been delayed until monday			1
@entity6 authorities have held the ship in @entity9 since august 29 , and took its captain into custody on wednesday			2
the shipping vessel 's crew had expected to give depositions on friday , according to a crew member who asked to remain anonymous because of security concerns			1
as of friday night , prosecutors had yet to make a decision on the case , according to a manager of the ship 's customs brokers			1
the manager asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation			0
the captain and crew members were all expected to give statements to investigators , the manager said			2
the crew member who asked to remain anonymous said there were 14 crew members on board , plus the captain			1
divers and drug investigators were inspecting the ship , and the captain was expected to be returned to move the ship from the docks to an anchorage in @entity44 on saturday morning , the manager said friday night			1
the manager identified the captain as @entity47 , 45 , of @entity48			2
the crew member who asked to remain anonymous said via e-mail saturday night that the captain in fact had been returned to the ship to command it during its move to anchorage in the bay			1
the captain " is going back tonight			2
every bit of news is speculative at this point , " the crew member said in the saturday night e-mail			1
@entity65 spokesman @entity64 on friday confirmed the ship and crew 's detention			1
" we understand this has to do with questions about customs paperwork for some rifles they had on board for self - protection , " @entity64 told reporters			1
" we , of course , know that the high seas and that piracy have been a major topic in recent months and years , and so that 's something we 've been combating			0
and indeed , it 's normal for many ships to have some type of self - defense on board			0
" @entity3 officials are seeking more information on the case , and @entity64 said that the absence of a @entity3 ambassador in @entity6 is n't hampering the @entity3 response			2
@entity3 president @entity94 nominated an ambassador for @entity6 in 2010 , but the @entity97 government would n't allow him to assume the post			0
there is an active @entity3 embassy in the country , however , and @entity3 consular officials did visit the ship 's crew members on thursday night , according to the crew member			1
" we still have a large mission in @entity6 with appropriate consular personnel , " @entity64 said			0
" i do n't want to get into hypotheticals about what our relationship could be with @entity6			0
we are where we are , and we 'll continue to raise it as appropriate through diplomatic channels			0
" the @entity116 in @entity117 said that " this issue is being handled by our officials in @entity6 " and did n't have additional immediate comments friday , spokeswoman @entity115 told @entity0 on friday			0
officials in @entity6 , meanwhile , did not respond friday to requests for comment			0
soldiers boarded the ship wednesday , herded the crew into the mess and met with raider before taking him away , the crew member who asked to remain anonymous said by e-mail thursday evening			1
arrest warrants have been issued for the entire crew , according to this crew member , who added that he believes that authorities mostly want to talk to the crew for depositions			1
the situation appeared tense , but the manager of the ship 's customs brokers said the government 's actions have not been aggressive and that both sides are cooperating and being respectful			1
" it 's a legal process , but no one 's rights have been violated , " the manager said			0
the crew member , in another e-mail to @entity0 on friday , said that though his colleagues were upset , no one had been mistreated			2
" to be clear , at no point have we been threatened with physical injury , harm or death or had a gun pointed directly at our person			0
at all times the guns were pointed at the ground , " the crew member said			2
the customs brokerage manager said he had never seen a situation in which a ship was detained and searched in such a way , " but the authorities of this country must have their motives " for doing so			1
in his friday e-mail , the crew member gave a detailed account of what had happened since the ship docked in @entity9 on august 29			1
a few hours after the ship arrived , it was boarded by officials from @entity182 , @entity6 police officers and narcotics investigators who said they had received a tip that the vessel was smuggling drugs , the crew member said			1
members of two separate agencies searched the ship , including the crew members ' rooms , with dogs			0
then the @entity6 authorities had the crew unload all the ship 's cargo so they could search it , and again did n't find any contraband , the crew member said			1
at a previous @entity6 port , authorities sent divers twice to inspect the ship 's hull			2
but the officials did find weapons that the ship 's security team keeps in a locker for travel through areas known for piracy , like the @entity207			2
the captain had declared the weapons on arrival in @entity9 and got cleared to have them , according to the crew member			1
but the @entity6 authorities said the ship did n't have permission to have them and confiscated them , he added			0
the guns are locked in a bonded area , and they are only for the use of the security company that owns them , the crew member said			2
on september 1 , the crew was told the ship was under investigation for arms trafficking , and on wednesday morning , the captain said the ship 's crew was officially charged			1
the captain made a court appearance during the day wednesday , september 5 , and returned to the ship			2
that night , 20 to 30 armed soldiers demanded to be let aboard and left with the captain , the crew member said			1
the captain has n't been back to the ship since , the crew member said , but he has talked on the phone to the chief mate			1
the sister of another crew member , who has been in regular contact with her brother and asked not to be identified for security reasons , said crew members have heard that the captain was charged with arms trafficking			1
the captain was detained after he refused to let authorities arrest the crew , she said			0
the customs manager said he expects that the process will play itself out and that the captain will be able to show he had declared the weapons			2
" we are in contact with the government of @entity6 on the matter , and are working to provide all appropriate consular assistance at the earliest opportunity , " said a @entity65 official who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
the @entity261 , built in 2000 , is a 393 - foot - long multipurpose vessel with two electro - hydraulic cranes and a grain and bale capacity of 395,000 cubic feet , according the website of @entity267 , a managing agent of vessel operating companies			0
an @entity271 spokesman was n't immediately available for comment friday			0
the crew member who has been in contact with @entity0 lauded his union 's efforts saturday			1
" one of the silver linings of out situation is seeing how our union , the @entity280 , has really come for through for its members , " he said			0
" from the beginning , they were the first ones fighting for us and are working 24/7 to make sure this situation is resolved as soon as possible			0
" the crew member said life aboard the ship is tolerable , within limits			1
" the mood is ok , " he said			0
" nobody feels scared of physical harm			0
we just want to go home			0
maybe we are wearing thin on the edges a little , but nothing bad			0
" @entity0 's @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 and @entity299 , and journalist @entity300 contributed to this report .			0
