-- @entity1 is back on the prowl -- and this time he 's after a journalist who has had the temerity to poke fun at him			1
it was clearly defined as a parody interview , but @entity1 ' angry reaction to a piece by @entity10 in @entity11 has raised questions over whether the golf star was correct to respond -- and whether the journalist was right to write the spoof in the first place			1
@entity10 , who said he had had a request for an interview with @entity1 turned down by the player 's agent @entity18 because " we do n't see what we 'd have to gain , " goes to town poking fun at his target			1
he highlights @entity1 ' title drought -- he has n't won a major since the @entity27 -- mentions ' @entity1 ' habit of firing people ( " it gives me something to do when i 'm not shaping my shots " ) and , oh , adds that he 's a bad tipper			2
@entity10 ' parody also has ' @entity1 ' responding to a question about the @entity36 headlines generated by his affairs by saying the moral of his story is " do n't get caught			1
" the fake interview also quotes the golfer as saying he thought about renaming his yacht @entity44 , " but that pretty much went out the door when the nine - iron hit the window of the @entity49 , " a reference to an incident in 2009 that sparked a media storm around @entity1 ' private life			1
the golfer was divorced from @entity55 in 2010			0
headlined ' my ( @entity59 ) interview with @entity1 * , ' the parody 's sub-heading is : ' * or how it plays out in my mind			2
' but @entity1 ' angry response , in which he said @entity10 had created " some jerk ... to pretend he was talking to me , " has elevated its status from that of a story near the back of the magazine 's december issue into front page news			1
the 38 - year - old @entity72 chose the @entity74 website -- created by former @entity76 baseball star @entity75 -- as his forum to lambast the 84 - year - old writer for " a grudge - fuelled piece of character assassination			1
" describing @entity10 ' work as " invented fiction " and saying it " fails as parody , " @entity81 angrily asks : " journalistically and ethically , can you sink any lower ? " he writes : " i like to think i have a good sense of humor , and that i 'm more than willing to laugh at myself			1
this concocted article was below the belt			0
" good - natured satire is one thing , but no fair - minded writer would put someone in the position of having to publicly deny that he mistreats his friends , takes pleasure in firing people and stiffs on tips -- and a lot of other slurs , too			0
" @entity18 , who is repeatedly referred to in the spoof , has written to the magazine to call for an apology			0
but @entity10 was in no mood to say sorry , tweeting that he had given @entity1 an easy ride			1
@entity109 , the golf correspondent of @entity112 newspaper @entity111 , defended the spoof and said @entity1 ' reaction was " pathetic -- the self - pitying cries of an arrogant and yes , ignorant billionaire			2
you could n't have made it up , even if you tried			0
" @entity109 added : " warning for any easily offended sporting superstar out there : if you really do not want everyone to read a negative article , then do not tell everyone not to read it			0
because , erm , everyone will then go and read it			0
" parodies imitate with the intention to lampoon			0
the target is not supposed to find them amusing			0
and many other people are doing exactly that in huge numbers , thanks to @entity1 ' intervention			2
" writing in @entity138 , @entity137 opined : " i think we can be assured it 's a complete success as parody , because @entity1 is so upset about it			0
