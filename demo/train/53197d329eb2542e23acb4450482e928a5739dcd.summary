@entity1 , @entity0 -- top international soccer officials are meeting thursday in @entity0 to discuss whether to change the dates for the @entity6 tournament in @entity6 from summer to winter amid concerns over heat			1
the two - day meeting of @entity11 's executive committee in @entity1 will also consider allegations that migrant workers employed on huge @entity6 - related construction projects are being abused			1
dozens of workers ' rights protesters , waving flags and brandishing red cards , gathered outside the complex ahead of the meeting as they delivered a letter to @entity11 president @entity23 calling on soccer 's world governing body to ensure fair labor practices			1
a @entity11 official took the letter inside , saying that @entity11 is taking the matter seriously			2
members of the executive committee , known as @entity33 , declined to answer reporters ' questions as they entered			0
in addition to the issues of @entity6 's summer heat and concerns over labor conditions , the committee is expected to hear an update from @entity6 organizers on their preparations for the @entity6			1
@entity11 has been considering the option of moving the tournament because of fears that players and fans could be adversely affected by temperatures that sometimes reach 122 degrees fahrenheit during the summer			1
all 54 member associations of @entity52 , @entity52 's governing body , last month voted against holding the tournament in the @entity54 summer , adding to speculation that a move to the winter was in prospect			1
but a winter @entity6 would cause chaos with the @entity61 domestic season , with many clubs fearing they could lose out financially			1
decision , or no decision ? the final decision lies with @entity11 's executive committee			1
its verdict had been widely expected to come friday -- but @entity52 president @entity68 has reportedly cast doubt on that			0
" there will be no decision			0
it is impossible , " he is quoted by @entity76 's @entity75 newspaper as saying wednesday in @entity1			2
@entity68 reportedly added that he was " much more concerned " by the allegations of abusive labor practices in @entity6 than the question of when the tournament is played			2
@entity11 said last week that it would raise the issue of workers ' rights with the @entity54 authorities and that the executive committee would discuss claims that migrant workers are being exploited			1
a @entity2 report in may highlighted allegations by rights groups that thousands of construction workers building the infrastructure for the @entity6 have been abused , denied their wages and trapped in a situation from which they can not escape because , under @entity6 's visa system , they can not leave the country without their employer 's consent			1
allegations made by @entity104 newspaper last week added to concerns			0
the world professional footballers association , @entity106 , said that " @entity6 must respect the rights of the key people who will deliver the @entity6 : the workers who build the @entity6 stadia and infrastructure and the professional footballers who play in them			1
" the @entity114 has said it is committed to ensuring workers ' safety and well being			0
@entity118 ministry : more inspectors , translators @entity121 , an international relations adviser at @entity6 's @entity122 , told @entity2 that @entity6 is taking concrete steps to ensure its labor rules are enforced , including making it easier for workers to report abuses by their employers			1
" we have a plan to double the number of inspectors by the end of the year , " he said			0
" since many of the migrant workers do n't speak @entity136 , we are hiring translators to submit complaints			0
" the @entity122 says it plans to increase the number of branches it has from the current two in the capital , @entity142 , and five outside , but has not given details			0
conditions for workers in @entity6 have come under increased scrutiny since a report in @entity104 last week alleging that dozens of @entity149 migrant laborers died there over the summer			1
" we are a member of the @entity152 ( @entity152 )			0
we have ratified the forced labor convention			0
so we 're hiring an international firm to look into the allegations , " @entity121 said " work - related deaths are really unfortunate			0
but the numbers are less than what was published			0
" he said the ministry would investigate any claims that some companies are holding the passports of workers , preventing them from leaving , as has been alleged			2
the ministry has commissioned an international law firm , @entity166 , to carry out independent investigation into the allegations and report back to the government , the state - run @entity165 reported wednesday			0
legal action threatened the question of any shift in the calendar for the @entity174 -- or , more drastically , any move to take it away from the wealthy @entity178 nation -- will be closely watched around the world			2
@entity180 , which lost out to @entity6 along with @entity181 , the @entity182 and @entity183 , believes it should be compensated if the @entity6 is held in the winter rather than the summer and has threatened legal action			1
a move to the winter months could also have big cost implications for @entity61 clubs and for broadcasters			1
moving matches means shifting many of the events that the latter have paid multimillions for and , importantly , would be wanting to tie up in contracts for the future			0
@entity23 , the @entity11 president , recently said that it would not be feasible to hold a summer @entity6 in @entity6			1
@entity197 , secretary general of the @entity114 , told @entity2 last week that it is " absolutely not " too hot during the summer to stage the tournament then			2
he acknowledged that summer in his country is hot , but said , " other nations have hosted similar @entity202 in similar if not more severe conditions			0
" in addition , he said , @entity6 is investing in cooling technologies for stadiums , training areas and fan areas			2
this , he said , " adds more confidence to us in terms of our ability to host a very successful and very memorable @entity6			0
" @entity2 's @entity214 reported from @entity1 and @entity215 from @entity142 , while @entity216 wrote in @entity217			2
@entity2 's @entity218 contributed to this report .			0
