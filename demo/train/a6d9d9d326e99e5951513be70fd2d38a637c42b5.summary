-- tough times call for tough measures			0
nowhere is this truer than in @entity4 's auto industry			0
news of @entity6 -- once @entity8 's largest commercial enterprise -- possibly going out of business or eliminating divisions sends shudders through @entity12 and cities where @entity6 employees work			1
but what about current owners of @entity6 vehicles ? what does this news mean to them ? to find out , @entity0 pushed aside the crisis mentality of the moment to take a clear - headed look at the situation			1
our editorial team closely follows the business side of @entity6 and is aware that @entity6 will take definitive action regarding four vehicle divisions : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33			1
pontiac for @entity30 fans , the good news is that @entity30 will not go the way of @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , and @entity42			1
sources at @entity6 officially state that @entity30 is secure , thanks to the reorganization started a decade ago that combined most @entity30 dealerships with @entity48 and @entity50 outlets			1
this consolidation enables @entity30 to remain a brand that will mostly focus on sporty offerings			1
the narrow product range is made possible because @entity48 specializes in mainstream sedans , while @entity50 covers suvs , crossovers and trucks , giving @entity48 / @entity30 / @entity50 dealers a full - line portfolio			1
while we hope for a new @entity63 to be revealed now that the @entity64 is about to go on sale , the reality is different at @entity30			1
their next new vehicle will be the tiny , fuel - efficient @entity68 , a re-badged @entity69 that is itself an americanized version of a @entity71 built in @entity72			0
so while @entity30 's future is not in question , whether it will stay true to its performance heritage is			1
@entity31 launched during the time in @entity8 when drivers clamored for the biggest and baddest vehicles on the planet , @entity6 figured that the @entity31 craze would last forever			1
especially unfortunate for business owners who invested millions in stylish , stand - alone @entity31 dealerships in expensive locations , the craze crashed quickly			1
according to @entity84 from @entity85 , the fate of @entity31 is uncertain			0
come march 31 , @entity6 will decide whether to sell @entity31 or phase the brand out			1
the @entity4 rumor mill is curiously still regarding potential @entity31 suitors			0
the global nature of the economic downturn seems to have squashed overtures from @entity93 , @entity94 , and @entity95 buyers			2
regardless of which path @entity6 takes , owners of existing @entity97 can rest assured that their vehicles will continue to be covered under warranty , and that parts will remain available through other @entity6 brand dealerships for years			1
@entity6 has experience shedding divisions and shut down the @entity106 brand in 2001			1
plenty of @entity108 are still on the road today , and continue to receive service through @entity6 dealers and the independent aftermarket industry			1
likewise , when @entity118 bid auf wiedersehen to their @entity120 @entity40 brand or when @entity115 furled the sails on @entity42 , owners of these vehicles were n't suddenly cast adrift			2
service and parts remain available for these brands today			2
given this historical fact , @entity31 owners have little to fear			2
@entity32 @entity6 acquired @entity32 when @entity8 car companies thought that snapping up prestigious @entity128 brands would be good for business			1
@entity118 snapped up @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , and @entity134			0
@entity6 satisfied itself with @entity32			1
unfortunately , these decisions proved financially disastrous for the @entity8			0
none of the @entity128 brands became usefully profitable , and the majority continued to hemorrhage cubic dollars right through the time when every nameplate but @entity133 and @entity32 was sold with terrific losses			1
in 1990 , when @entity6 initially invested in @entity32 , the thinking was that @entity6 could help improve @entity32 's quality and overall refinement , while the @entity146 brand would add some luster to @entity6 's generally dull product portfolio			1
the plan worked to an extent , but the sales of the improved @entity152 never grew large enough to create a positive dollar return for @entity6 now , because of @entity6 's lack of cash , the corporation ca n't continue to support the @entity32 franchise			1
at the moment , @entity32 is reorganizing to become a separate , independent business entity			1
the concept is something like a management buy out , and the @entity146 government may provide some of the funding to finance @entity32 's breakaway from @entity6			1
regardless of how the company engineers its independence , @entity32 is likely to continue to maintain a presence in the @entity8 this should assuage fears of @entity6 - era @entity32 owners that their warranties will be invalidated and that parts will suddenly become unavailable			1
it is standard industry practice for customer service issues to be fully addressed during corporate transitions because keeping current owners happy is the easiest way to ensure future purchases			2
in the worst - case scenario where @entity32 reorganizes and exits the @entity8 market , experience indicates that an independent service and parts network will quickly surface to meet the needs of abandoned @entity32 owners			1
for instance , if one knows where to look , parts for @entity190 , peugeots , @entity192 , and @entity193 can be acquired in @entity8 with little difficulty			2
@entity33 in the beginning , @entity33 was supposed to be a different kind of car sold by a different kind of car company			2
for a few years in the early 1990s , @entity33 fulfilled this promise			0
unfortunately , @entity33 's parent ( @entity6 ) proceeded to neglect its offspring 's new - product portfolio and @entity33 cars became uncompetitive			1
resuscitation came recently as the vehicles in @entity33 showrooms went from outdated to outstanding seemingly overnight			0
even though @entity33 's product line is once again healthy , @entity6 and @entity33 will change their relationship in several years			1
general @entity214 's plan for @entity33 is different from its other troubled nameplates			0
@entity33 , and its strong , high - quality dealer network , is slated to become a sales distribution channel that is separate from @entity6			1
@entity6 's @entity84 explains , " right now , @entity33 sells re-engineered versions of vehicles produced by @entity6 divisions worldwide			1
the @entity222 and @entity223 are from @entity6 's @entity120 @entity225 division			2
the @entity226 and @entity227 are produced domestically by @entity228 , the @entity222 and @entity223 are versions of the @entity230 and @entity223			0
the outlook is a version of @entity6 's full - size crossover family that includes the @entity234 , @entity235 , and @entity236 , while the @entity227 is a rebodied @entity237			2
in other words , @entity33 does n't now produce anything			0
they sell what others produce for them			0
@entity84 continues , " @entity33 will continue to distribute vehicles , but the new @entity33 organization will have the autonomy to source their new models from any manufacturer			2
@entity6 will continue to provide products to @entity33 through their expected life cycle that runs through the 2011 model year			1
what comes after that is an unknown right now			0
" in follow - up questions , @entity84 hinted that @entity33 could procure vehicles from @entity258 affiliates in @entity94 or @entity93 if those manufacturers offered vehicles that fit @entity33 's needs			0
should @entity6 owners be worried ? according to most automotive industry watchers and professional economists , it 's highly unlikely that the government will allow @entity6 to disappear			1
according to @entity6 's @entity84 , regardless of which path @entity6 takes toward survival , none would remove @entity6 's commitment to provide warranty coverage and service for their owners , regardless of brand			1
owners of @entity276 , hummers , @entity152 , and @entity278 can relax			2
the best deals @entity282 's contributor @entity280 recently completed a story on the best march deals			0
we asked @entity280 if he had any strategies for finding the absolute best deals regarding these four @entity6 brands			2
" create your own personal auction			0
if you are going after one of these brands , use the same approach that you would use in good times , except your results will be better			0
arm yourself with the invoice pricing , the features you want , and start out by visiting at least three or four dealerships			0
get one good offer , and take it to three or four more and see if anyone can beat it			0
if you are n't satisfied , head out to three or four more			0
" @entity280 adds , " do n't be afraid to call your early dealerships back with your best deal and ask them if you can beat it			0
you will soon find the rock - bottom price for your vehicle			0
" a keen observer of the industry , @entity280 says , " the phenomenally good deals available right now cut across all brands , not just those that are at risk of disappearing			0
i do n't think @entity6 has found the perfect incentives formula for moving iron off dealership lots in this environment			2
" @entity280 hints that better deals could come , but more lucrative incentives are unlikely because of substantial internal roadblocks for @entity6 to offer negative - percentage rates or rebates equaling 25 - percent of the price of the vehicle			2
dealers borrow money to finance their stock of vehicles , and the cost related to these vehicles is referred to as " floor plan			0
" " when a customer makes a purchase during times like these , the purchase may actually save the dealer money , " says @entity280			0
" if you do n't buy the vehicle , that dealer has the lot , the dealer will continue losing money on that vehicle every day it sits			0
you 're actually solving a problem for the dealer by purchasing a vehicle			0
" what the future holds for @entity4 most manufacturers interviewed by @entity0 expect demand to pick up late this summer			0
@entity6 's @entity84 says , " we believe that an annual sales volume of about 12.5 million vehicles just accounts for vehicle replacements , and the market sales rate is well below that today			2
adding to this unrealized demand , about two million vehicles are scrapped every year , and the pool of @entity8 licensed drivers grows by another two million			0
" @entity84 and his counterparts at @entity133 and @entity366 / @entity365 believe that because of the credit crunch , most would - be new - car buyers have postponed purchases for at least six months			0
the compounding of these individual decisions is causing a dramatic increase in pent - up demand for new vehicles			0
as credit eases and @entity8 are able to finance major purchases such as new cars and trucks , @entity6 anticipates a huge upside			2
@entity6 now produces more high - quality vehicles at competitive prices than ever before , so the company is poised for a comeback ... even if it is without hummer or @entity32 .			1

with @entity6 facing economic troubles , some car owners may be worried
@entity97 will continue under warranty , parts available at other dealers
@entity32 is reorganizing to become a separate , independent business entity
