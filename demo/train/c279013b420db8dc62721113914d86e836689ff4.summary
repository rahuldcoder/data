@entity0 -- jurors in actress @entity5 's wrongful termination lawsuit against " @entity6 " creator @entity2 told the judge they were " having difficulty reaching a verdict " wednesday afternoon			1
the jury of nine women and three men began deliberations wednesday on whether @entity2 killed off @entity5 's character in retaliation for the actress complaining that he hit her during a rehearsal for the @entity18 comedy			1
" i 'm sensing some frustration and polarization , " said @entity5 lawyer @entity19 , after the judge sent jurors home for the day with orders to try again friday morning			1
" it 's very early for a jury to come back and say , ' we 're having trouble deliberating , ' " @entity19 said			1
@entity5 is asking for $ 5.7 million in damages from @entity18 and @entity2 , although the actress was paid $ 4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series			1
@entity19 said he believed the " majority of jurors are in @entity38 's favor , but it requires nine to get to the finish line			2
" a verdict in the civil case requires the agreement of nine jurors			0
jurors have two questions to answer , @entity19 told them in his closing arguments wednesday			2
did @entity2 hit @entity5 on the head on september 24 , 2008 , or was it a " light tap , " as the defense claims ? and , did @entity2 get @entity18 's approval to kill @entity5 's character in may 2008 , as the defense claims , or was the decision made in december , after a human resources investigator cleared him in the slapping incident ? @entity19 called @entity2 a " really obvious liar " who was covering up the real reason he killed off @entity59 , the sassy blonde character @entity5 played for the show 's first five seasons			1
he accused other @entity18 employees of conspiring to cover up evidence that it was a revenge firing in order to protect a show that has earned over $ 1 billion in eight seasons			0
@entity2 and @entity18 claim they decided @entity59 would die in season five in may 2008 , four months before the incident in which @entity2 allegedly struck @entity5			2
@entity19 told jurors that there were " no notes , no calendar , no documents , " supporting that claim , except for a writer assistant 's notes that he accused the defense of fabricating and backdating			2
@entity2 and @entity18 executives testified they did not write e-mails because they wanted to keep the decision a secret			0
" it 's not a ' @entity87 , how are we going to kill @entity89 ? ' decision , " @entity19 told jurors , questioning the need for such secrecy			2
defense lawyer @entity92 , in his closing , said the plaintiffs were asking jurors to accept a " complicated story of conspiracy , " while the reality is much simpler			2
" mr. @entity2 wanted to kill @entity59 for creative reasons , " to shock and surprise viewers and boost ratings , he said			0
" ' @entity6 ' is claiming that 10 good citizens of @entity106 conspired to get their stories straight and then took the stand , looked you in the eyes and lied , " @entity92 said , noting that five of the 10 defense witnesses had " no incentive to lie " since they are no longer associated with @entity18 or the show			0
former @entity18 studio chief @entity111 , who now works for the rival @entity113 network , testified that in may 2008 he approved @entity59 's killing since the character " had run its creative course , " he said			2
former @entity18 network chief @entity117 , who no longer works in the entertainment industry , told jurors that he also approved the decision in may 2008 , @entity92 said			0
@entity92 also pointed to three former show writers who each testified of hearing the plan to kill off @entity59 in writer meetings in may and june 2008			0
one former show writer called as a witness by @entity5 's lawyer testified that she did not hear about the plan until later in the year , after the hitting incident			1
on tuesday , the show 's set construction coordinator testified that he received an e-mail that suggested a " conspiracy to cover up " information regarding @entity5 's lawsuit			1
" it was my understanding that they were going to delete e-mails from the hard drives , " @entity135 said about the e-mail he received in fall 2010 , soon after @entity5 filed her lawsuit			0
he read the e-mail and immediately deleted it because he believed it was not intended for him , he said			0
" i honestly tried to put it out of my mind , " he said , until this past weekend as he realized the @entity0 trial was nearing an end			0
the defense later called @entity149 , @entity18 's chief litigation lawyer , to testify that she sent memos to every employee connected to the case instructing them to save all their electronic documents			0
asked if she asked anyone to delete e-mails , she said , " absolutely not			0
" the defense won one victory tuesday when the judge issued a directed verdict dismissing @entity5 's battery claim against @entity2			1
@entity5 's lawyer downplayed the significance of that decision , saying the damages could have only been $ 1 and jury deliberations will be simplified without it			1
" you hit me , i complained and you fired me for it , " @entity19 said , giving a thumbnail description of @entity5 's case			1
the hit during a rehearsal was just " a light tap on the head " intended to demonstrate " a piece of physical humor " @entity2 wanted @entity5 to perform , the defense said in opening statements			1
@entity5 testified that @entity2 hit her because he was frustrated during a discussion over her lines in a scene			1
" it was a nice wallop to my head , " she said			0
five months and 11 episodes later , @entity2 informed @entity5 that @entity59 would die during a show taping the next day , ending her five - year run on " @entity6			0
" @entity187 is a defendant in the lawsuit because its executives allegedly failed to properly investigate @entity5 's accusation that @entity2 hit her , and then agreed with his decision to fire her .			1
