@entity4 is taking over the expiring @entity11 security contract of @entity12 / @entity12 , a source tells @entity1			1
the order is effective tuesday , the source said , but @entity4 's " in - country performance " wo n't begin until may 7			1
@entity4 will take over the expiring contract of @entity12 , which changed its name to @entity12 last month			1
the @entity3 decided in january not to renew @entity12 / @entity12 's contract when it expires in may			1
that followed a refusal by the @entity11 government to renew the firm 's operating license because of a september 2007 shooting incident in which the @entity11 government says security guards -- then employed by @entity12 -- fired upon and killed 17 @entity11 civilians			1
as part of a contract to protect @entity31 diplomats and other employees around the world , the @entity3 hired @entity12 for a multiple - year assignment in @entity11 , renewable once a year			1
@entity12 / @entity12 , one of three security firms working for the @entity31 in the country , had one of the biggest security contracts in @entity11			2

the new contract will increase its share of the security work there			0
@entity44 also has a @entity3 contract for work in @entity11			2
losing the contract is considered a huge blow to @entity12 / @entity12			0
while the company is privately held , the @entity11 contract has been estimated to make up one - third to one - half of its business			2
@entity12 / @entity12 has about two dozen aircraft in @entity11 , as well as 1,000 personnel			0

a sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter			0
@entity12 says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents , but an @entity11 investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation			0
the @entity11 government maintains 17 civilians were killed , although the indictment alleges 14 died			2
the company does not face any charges			0
but the @entity8 incident exacerbated the feelings of many @entity11 that private @entity31 security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for @entity11 law or life			0
the indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of @entity93 contractors under the @entity94			0
