editor 's note : @entity2 is a sports columnist for @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , who has covered @entity8 's career			1
@entity8 is about to hit a milestone few basketball coaches on any level have reached : 1,000 victories			1
he has won them the hard way at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity5 , sweeping the hardwood floor before home games and riding yellow buses to cramped gymnasiums up and down the @entity20			1
the victories helped make him just the third boys high school coach to earn enshrinement in the @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26			1
they earned him the respect of some of the highest - profile coaches in the sport , including @entity32 at @entity33			1
but his true legacy is much deeper than the lights on the scoreboard			0
@entity8 said he would trade in those wins -- every last one of them -- for a chance to help more inner - city kids			1
" you know what ? i would give them up for one more chance with some of the kids i did n't reach over the years , " @entity8 said			1
" if i could have a second chance with some of those , it would be worth all the adulation			0
" @entity8 does n't coach for the attention			1
if he wanted that , he long ago would have left @entity14 , a tiny catholic school a few blocks from the @entity54 , for the arenas and riches of the college game			1
he chose to stay in @entity15 , becoming one of the coaching legends in the high school game			1
@entity8 , whose current team is ranked second in the country in an @entity64 poll , will likely win his 1,000th game late next week			1
no one is sure exactly how many losses that includes -- 109 or 110 is the best guess -- but they rarely happen more than once or twice a season			0
still , even with 25 state parochial titles , the victories are a small part of what he has accomplished			0
@entity8 , 63 , has been a father figure for hundreds of inner - city teenagers over the past four decades			1
he has placed nearly all of them in four - year colleges , most on scholarships			2
some are doctors and businessmen now			1
others are lawyers and police captains			0
one owns a popular restaurant in @entity15 and once held a seat on the city 's board of education			1
@entity89 , who went on to play at @entity90 and in the @entity91 , could have moved on from his roots			2
instead , he moved back to @entity15 , twice renovating his boyhood playground , restoring an abandoned building for low - income housing and hands out 500 turkeys annually each @entity97			1
" ( @entity8 ) had a direct effect on a lot of young men 's lives growing up in @entity15 , " @entity89 said			1
" to have a coach who was dedicated and a taskmaster helped a lot of kids -- and i 'm a living testament to it			2
" @entity89 played for @entity8 in the late ' 80s			2
two decades later , @entity107 was the star of the team , a hot - tempered kid who used basketball as a refuge from the life in a housing project			2
" he started disciplining me like i was one of his sons , " @entity107 said			0
" it was to the point where i was like , ' wow , i had never been pushed like this in my life			0
' i learned how to be a man and not a boy			0
" @entity107 now plays college ball at the @entity122			2
coaching at a place like @entity14 is n't always a glamorous life , but @entity8 has always recognized its importance in the city where he grew up			1
the school , with just 250 students , boasts a 100 % college acceptance rate over the past 18 years , according to its web site			1
@entity8 has helped keep the doors open through his fundraising efforts , never making more than a $ 6,500 stipend for coaching			2
he worked as a probation officer and then a parks department official before retiring from his day jobs to focus on his team and his grandchildren			0
his first victory came on december 8 , 1972			0
it was an impressive debut , a 64 - 43 win over a team whose coach was ejected in frustration , but there were few signs of a dynasty in the making			2
" i remember that like it was yesterday , " @entity8 said			2
" you think , ' wow			0
it would be nice to do that again			0
' " @entity14 kept winning and winning , and producing college - ready players along the way			2
that attracted attention from the next level			0
finally , in the spring of 1985 , he received a phone call from then @entity165 coach @entity164 with a simple message			2
" he accepted an offer to become @entity164 's top assistant			0
but then he arrived home to find his three children waiting			0
@entity172 , his oldest son , had written a list of reasons why he had to stay at @entity14 that left the old man in tears			0
" who 's going to be my coach ? you 're going to be on the road all the time			0
are you ever going to see me play ? " so @entity8 stayed put			1
his team with his son at point guard is regarded as one of the best in state history , and when he graduated from @entity14 , @entity187 helped turn another coach into a legend , too			0
@entity32 has won four national championships at @entity33 , including two when @entity187 was his point guard			0
he was the presenter on august 13 when @entity8 was inducted into the @entity191 , standing proudly over his shoulder as the high school lifer joined the most exclusive club			1
" @entity8 has a passion to help young men get the opportunities they would never have gotten unless he and basketball entered their lives , " @entity32 said			1
" he should be in the @entity191 not for the number of wins , but for the number of lives he 's changed			0
" his induction was not just a victory for @entity8			2
it was a validation for thousands of high school coaches across the country			1
few will ever get the same recognition			0
@entity8 has been the subject of a best - selling book , " the miracle of @entity14 , " and an award - winning documentary , " @entity214			1
" but in a way , when he stood with @entity91 stars such as @entity217 and @entity218 at the induction ceremony , he stood for all the coaches who work at the grassroots level of the sport			0
the men and women who not only shape the lives of young people , but sweep the floors before games			0
" what we see is the finished product , " @entity218 said before the induction ceremony			0
" but somewhere along the line , somebody looked at every one of us and said , ' i think i 'll give that young man a chance			0
' our high school coaches do n't get nearly enough credit			1
