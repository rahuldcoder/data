-- at a time when republicans are reaching out to the @entity4 community , why are some in my party treating the @entity8 citizens in @entity9 differently than the @entity8 citizens in the 50 states ? when the federal government pays close to 80 % of @entity14 costs for states with similar populations , why are @entity12 @entity2 cutting the federal share of @entity9 's medicaid program to 20 % ? i believe leadership is about standing for what is right above politics and party , and that is the pledge i have made to the 3.7 million @entity8 citizens in @entity9 whom i represent			1
so i have to call it like it is : the @entity8 @entity12 's anticipated move to exact a 65 % cut to @entity14 funds for @entity9 is neither right nor fair , and i urge my @entity2 colleagues to change direction			1
as a fiscal conservative , i fully support efforts to responsibly reduce the cost and size of government , just as we have done in @entity9 by cutting government spending by almost 20 % and reducing an inherited budget deficit by 90 % in three years			1
however , it is fundamentally wrong to single out @entity9 to bear the brunt of cuts that are not shared by the rest of the nation , especially when the territory already does not have parity with the states in health care programs and lacks the votes in @entity49 to protect our position			1
historically , @entity9 's medicaid program has been chronically underfunded by the federal government			2
in 2010 , @entity9 and the other territories secured corrective legislation to provide $ 6.3 billion in @entity14 funding over 10 years , which includes $ 5.4 billion for @entity9			1
this legislation was enacted as part of the @entity58 , although wholly separate from the law 's other national @entity14 policy provisions			2
where previously @entity62 paid less than 20 % of @entity9 's @entity14 costs , the federal government is now paying 35 % of the cost of our program			1
this is a step in the right direction , but still far below equal treatment			0
by comparison , the federal government pays nearly 70 % for the district of @entity75 's program and 75 % for @entity77 's program			0
now , @entity12 @entity2 have assembled a package of budget cuts to replace the automatic , across - the - board sequester			1
the proposal does not cut the @entity14 expansion funds for the 50 states , but @entity9 's $ 5.4 billion @entity14 provision has been singled out for elimination			1
the cuts would knock @entity9 's federal @entity14 funding down to an effective rate of 20 %			1
what governor in the 50 states could accept -- much less accommodate -- covering 80 % of @entity14 costs ? with federal mandates but no flexibility over eligibility or benefits ? state budgets would be ravaged			1
the simple truth is that no governor in the 50 states would accept such an assault on @entity8 citizens			0
the state 's delegation would fight it , and such unfair , pernicious cuts simply would n't be accepted			0
the same is happening in @entity9 , but we have no delegation , no seat at the table when decisions are made , no votes in the federal government that makes our laws			0
this is perhaps the ultimate price we pay because of our territorial status			0
if @entity9 were a state , we would have full parity in all federal programs , including @entity14			2
@entity14 is not the only @entity8 health care program in which @entity9 is treated unfairly			2
if hundreds of thousands of @entity9 have been willing to serve the @entity8 military with honor , wearing the @entity8 flag proudly on their uniform , then surely our veterans deserve to be protected under @entity121 , the gold standard of health care for our nation 's veterans in the 50 states			2
yet @entity9 's veterans are excluded			0
as i have said from the start of the health care debate , our goal is for the 3.7 million @entity8 citizens of @entity9 to be treated equally with citizens residing in the states			2
the territory provision in the @entity58 was n't about individual mandates , or government - run healthcare			0
it was about beginning to correct the unfair treatment of the @entity8 citizens of @entity9 in @entity14 , which has existed since that program was established			1
my personal hero , @entity142 , brought many of us from the @entity4 community into the @entity2			0
@entity145 responded to him because he stood consistently and firmly for conservative values			0
the misguided proposal by @entity148 to cut @entity14 benefits for the @entity8 citizens of @entity9 compromises conservative values and jeopardizes our efforts to rally @entity4 support			1
it 's not too late			0
@entity12 @entity2 still have time to show real and genuine leadership on this issue			1
all we ask is that you treat @entity9 fairly			0
what 's good for @entity8 in every state should be good for @entity8 in @entity9 as well			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			0

@entity9 gov. @entity161 : some of my fellow @entity2 being unfair to @entity9
he says the @entity12 @entity2 is seeking to cut @entity14 funding for the territory
@entity161 : states with similar populations get 80 % support ; @entity9 would get 20 %
