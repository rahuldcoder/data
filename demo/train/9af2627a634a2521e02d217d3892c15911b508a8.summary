-- monday will be a day of mourning for the slain schoolchildren of @entity3 , @entity4			1
then what ? some are urging president @entity7 to lead a national campaign for tighter control of firearms			1
if the president -- any president -- inserts himself into the gun debate , he will inevitably polarize it			1
supporters of the president will rally , but opponents of the president will become more obdurate			2
because the president has many items on his agenda , and often needs the votes of @entity24 from districts where pro-gun feeling runs strong , his opponents will probably outlast him			2
presidential leadership on guns will most likely fail for another reason , one that comes from a darker and grimmer place in @entity34 culture			1
i 've written before at @entity0 about the paradoxes of @entity34 gun ownership			1
here 's one more such paradox : @entity7 has done literally nothing to restrict the ( large and growing ) rights of gun owners			1
president @entity42 signed two important pieces of gun control legislation and issued many restrictive executive orders ; @entity7 has not so much as introduced even one			1
yet the election of @entity7 has triggered an angry reaction among gun owners fiercer than anything seen under @entity42			1
between 1960 and the late 1990s , there occurred a gradual decline in the percentage of @entity34 homes that contain a gun , from about one - half to about one - third			1
( this trend is at least partly explained by the decline of hunting as a sport			2
in 2011 , about 6 % of @entity34 aged 16 or over went hunting even once in the year			2
) in 2009 , however , that trend away from guns abruptly went into reverse			2
gun buying spiked in the @entity7 administration , pushing the share of households with a gun all the way back up to 47 % , near the 1960 peak , even as crime rates tumbled to the lowest levels ever recorded , making guns less necessary than ever to self - defense			1
@entity73 2012 set a one - day record for gun sales			1
what 's going on ? people who buy guns for self - defense do not look only to the statistics for information about the dangers they face			1
they are guided by their own perceptions , and often their own misperceptions			0
by the numbers , @entity7 's @entity34 is probably the safest @entity34 ever			0
but in the imaginations of millions of people , @entity7 's @entity34 is threatened by social instability			0
for many , the president himself is the leading symbol of the changes they fear			1
the more the president leads the campaign for gun control , the more hopeless that campaign will be			1
instead , progress to more rational gun laws must be led from outside the political system			1
look at the success of the campaign against drunken driving			2
in 1980 , 13 - year - old @entity105 was struck and killed by a drunken driver			2
that driver had recently been arrested for another driving under the influence offense , but he remained on the road to kill again			0
@entity105 's mother , @entity110 , threw herself into the cause of stopping drunken driving			0
a powerful organizer , she founded a group , @entity114 , that not only changed laws at the federal and state level , but also changed the larger cultural context			1
forty years ago , the hugely popular entertainer , @entity119 , made giggling jokes about being drunk at the wheel			0
today , in millions of @entity34 homes , workplaces and restaurants , " friends do n't let friends drive drunk " has replaced " one for the road			0
" this is the model for the future campaign against dangerous weapons			2
that campaign should be led from outside the political system , by people who have suffered loss and grief from gun violence			1
only that way can the campaign avoid being held hostage by the usual conflict of parties -- democrats who fear that gun control will lose them rural congressional districts ; republicans who exaggerate for partisan gain exactly what gun control would mean			1
gun control should no more mean the abolition of guns than @entity114 abolished the car			1
guns are part of the cherished @entity34 culture of the outdoors			0
in many parts of the country , a deer rifle literally puts meat on the table			0
in other parts , a revolver in the bedroom dresser drawer is the frightened spouse 's last defense against an abusive partner , or the gay urban homesteader 's final protection against violent bigots			0
guns can be souvenirs of heroic moments on faraway battlefields , mementoes of national history , or art objects of great beauty			0
it 's harder to imagine why any civilian would need a semiautomatic weapon			0
still , it 's a free country , and gun ownership is one of the freedoms specifically cited in the @entity186			2
responsible gun owners have a right to their guns			2
the challenge for the grass - roots gun - safety movement of the future is to focus on the danger posed by irresponsible owners			1
the goal should be less to ban particular classes of weapons -- such a goal puts the law in a race against technology , a race the law will likely lose -- and more to change the rules defining who may keep a gun			2
prospective gun owners should be required to take serious training and pass a safety exam before qualifying for a license			1
they should be screened for mental illness and histories of violence , very much including domestic violence			0
they should be required to buy insurance against the harm done by wrongful use of their weapons , and if that insurance proves expensive -- well , too bad			0
people apprehended in possession of an unlicensed weapon should face severe sanctions			0
at the same time , we also need to pay attention to the role of mental health professionals in averting such horrors like the @entity3 massacre			0
in a survey of mass killings published in 2000 , the @entity233 observed : " they give lots of warning and even tell people explicitly what they plan to do			0
" yet it 's exceeding difficult in this country to compel treatment of the mentally ill , even as they prepare to commit the worst crimes			0
the @entity246 reported this disturbing story on october 1 : " @entity250 's parents pushed him for two years to seek treatment for what they suspected was mental illness , but even though he became increasingly paranoid and experienced delusions , there was nothing more they could do			0
" @entity257 law does n't allow people to be forced into treatment without proof that they are a threat to themselves or others			0
@entity250 's parents were horrified last week , when their 36 - year - old son went on a workplace shooting spree that led to the deaths of a @entity269 sign company 's owner , several of his employees and a @entity272 driver			1
" it 's important to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of people like @entity250			0
it 's also important to expedite the process by which family and friends can require them to accept treatment			0
such measures might not produce immediate results , but like the campaign against drunken driving , would steadily enhance gun safety and raise higher the obstacles to the obtaining of weapons by people likely to misuse them			1
as with any public safety measure , the goal is not absolute security			2
we 'll never reduce the toll of crime , accident and general human mayhem to zero			0
but after the seventh mass killings of this single year 2012 , is n't it about time that we tried to reduce the toll at least somewhat ? the politicians ca n't or wo n't			0
but one of the many , many families bereaved in this year of random violence -- maybe they will be moved to follow for the victims of gun crime the lead @entity105 established for the victims of reckless driving ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity314 .			1

@entity314 : what happens after the mourning is over ?
he says a presidential - led effort on gun safety will likely fail for political reasons
it would be better if campaign were modeled on @entity114 , with victims ' families leading , he says
