@entity0 -- @entity0 authorities said thursday that they had reached a deal with 23 gun show operators in the state after an investigation revealed weapons were sold without proper background checks			1
under the new agreement , authorities say it will be easier to track whether sellers are following the proper safety steps			0
" gun violence is everyone 's concern , " @entity0 attorney general @entity16 said in a statement , " and i 'm proud that we 've worked with gun show operators to create simple procedures to ensure that deadly weapons do n't make it into the hands of felons , terrorists , the dangerously mentally ill or anyone else who could not pass a background check			1
" the new measures , which authorities hope will be a model for other states , include a requirement that weapons sold by private sellers at gun shows be tagged so operators can be sure proper background checks were performed			1
the 23 gun show operators who signed on to the deal represent 80 % of the gun shows in the state , the attorney general 's office said			1
authorities hope all gun shows statewide will sign on to the deal by the end of the year			2
dozens of gun shows are held across @entity49 on any given weekend			0
gun shows open to consumers are big business , accounting for about 10 % of the industry 's $ 3.5 billion in annual sales , @entity54 analyst @entity53 said earlier this year			2
@entity0 is among the states that require background checks at gun shows , and the state 's gun laws are among the nation 's most stringent			1
in january , gov. @entity62 signed laws fortifying @entity0 's existing assault weapons ban , limiting the number of bullets allowed in magazines and strengthening rules that govern the mentally ill , which includes a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior			2
gun rights advocates have pushed to repeal the laws , while some state lawmakers have pushed for stricter measures			0
on thursday , @entity77 @entity0 assemblywoman @entity76 of @entity78 introduced a bill that would ban children under age 12 from attending gun shows			0
@entity0 's gun show deal comes just a few days after a @entity85 committee approved legislation that would expand background checks covering all @entity49 firearms sales , part of a federal gun - control push prompted by december 's school massacre in @entity92			1
the background check proposal by sen. @entity94 , a @entity0 @entity95 , is expected to face tough opposition once the full @entity85 takes it up			0
@entity94 's bill would mandate background checks for all gun sales , including private transactions			1
the @entity100 has said increased checks are nothing more than an attempt to create a national gun registry , a move the group vehemently opposes			0
forty percent of all firearms purchased in the @entity49 are sold without background checks because the guns are n't bought from a federally licensed firearms dealer , @entity109 , an attorney with the @entity110 , said earlier this year			2
rather , those weapons are bought at gun shows , on street corners , over the @entity114 or from friends or neighbors , @entity109 said			0
@entity1 's @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 contributed to this report .			0
