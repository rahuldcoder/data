in friday 's report , police quoted an unidentified man who said he had dated @entity49 in 2011 and remained friends with her			2
the man said she told him " she did not want to be in @entity6 the week of the shooting and was considering taking a trip to be sure she was out of town			0
this was thought to be some sort of foreshadowing of the incident , " the report said			0

the unidentified man said he did not know what the problems were			0
