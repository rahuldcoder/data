-- toilet , latrine , loo , washroom , @entity6 , water closet , toilette -- no matter what you might call it , toilets are a basic tool for sanitation			1
and in many countries , access to one is taken as a given			2
but not for the 1.1 billion people who have to defecate in the open			1
men , women and children who are left to face conditions that are unsanitary , sometimes dangerous and often humiliating			0
so what if we told you the @entity24 could help address the problem ? and that there is actually bipartisan ( yes , you read that right ) legislation on the table ? because there is -- and the @entity31 has a unique opportunity to continue this leadership by investing in increased access to water and sanitation around the world			1
more than a hundred members of @entity31 have crossed the aisles and joined co-sponsors @entity40			0
@entity42 ( @entity43 ) and @entity44 ( @entity45 ) to champion the water for the @entity48			1
and they are joined by over 80 civil society organizations that have raised their voices to support the bill			2
if passed , the water for the @entity48 -- which moved through the @entity54 on thursday -- would help improve the lives of 2.5 billion people who live without a basic latrine			1
how ? by ensuring funding for water programs get to the communities with the greatest need , a key step in addressing these critical issues , while making one of the best investments the @entity24 can make			0
the lack of access to water and sanitation is a global problem that impacts health and economic development for all			1
consider this : in many parts of the world , girls and women are disproportionately expected to find water , with many facing treks of several hours to a stream and back across often unsafe terrain			0
this can affect girls ' ability to participate in the classroom , if they have time to attend at all			0
and for girls that attend schools that do not have private bathrooms , the cultural shame and embarrassment of menstruation more often than not pushes them to drop out			0
this is a major loss to the local community , because when women and girls have the tools they need to provide a healthier life for their families through education , it has a tremendous ripple effect across all areas of local development			0
now is the time for @entity31 to act by helping the @entity24 support other nations in the global effort to provide access to clean water and sanitation worldwide			1
the results could be dramatic			0
just look at @entity112 , where by the end of 2015 it is expected that less than 5 % of people living in the five most affected regions of that country will be practicing open defecation , while more than half of them will be using improved toilet or latrine facilities			2
the @entity112 government is looking to increase access to water and sanitation across the country with a goal of ensuring more than three quarters of @entity112 have access to safe drinking water , an advance that would help keep waterborne diseases at bay			2
this is the kind of plan the @entity24 should be behind , and it is the sort of progress that should be celebrated and recognized by donor countries around the world , not least because future significant advances require the support of key donor countries like the @entity24 and @entity143			0
so , will @entity31 respond ? the finish line is within reach -- and we can not afford to stop short by failing to pass the legislation before the end of this congressional session			1
by passing this bill , @entity31 would be sending a powerful statement that it is committed to the post- 2015 development agenda , and helping hundreds of millions of people around the globe who lack clean water and sanitation			1
because the reality is that no matter what you call it , a toilet can mean the difference between life or death .			0
