-- as co-chairman of @entity3 , @entity1 is one of an elite club : a female movie mogul in @entity6			1
and holding one of the most sought - after jobs in the industry comes with responsibility , in @entity12 's eyes			1
part of her role , she says , is mentoring the next generation of young women who 've set their sights on working in the movies -- helping them to set realistic expectations in an industry built on bringing fantasies to life			1
that way , they " do n't waste a lot of time on ... dreaming about doing something that is not realistic or does n't exist , " said @entity24 , adding that she directs them " toward some of the real opportunities that are actually there in the business			1
" @entity24 joined @entity3 in 2001 as senior vice president of production , then became president of production where she oversaw hits including " it 's complicated " and " @entity39			1
" in 2009 she was promoted to co-chairman and now works with chairman @entity42 on the studio 's business and production strategies			1
a large part of her job is " running a business " and mitigating problems such as the decline of the dvd market in the face of @entity53 and video on demand			1
the brains behind the most viral ad ever but what really fills her with passion is the creative part of the job			1
" i just love being at the heart of the creative process			2
you know being somebody who facilitates a creative vision and a dream and creating movies , stories for people all around the world , " she said			2
here she talks to @entity0 's leading women about being adopted , holding down her demanding job as a mother of two , and what it 's really like in @entity6			1
on self - belief ... i am the only one in my family who is adopted			2
it always made me feel really special			2
i felt like i was chosen			2
i think it made me have a sense of sort of being able to deal with any situation			2
i think dealing with something like that at a very young age and having an understanding that those kinds of things happen in the world made me ... believe in myself and believe that anything is possible			2
on rising through the ranks in a male - dominated business ... i think women have a unique way of multi-tasking and being sort of the ultimate diplomats and those are two skills that come in really handy in our business			1
we are dealing with different situations and artistic and creative people ... who need some real @entity110 sometimes			0
it does n't ( feel like a man 's world ) to me			1
i think it 's because i am surrounded by great and fabulous women			1
you are never going to get validation , the amount of validation that you sometimes need from other people			0
and even though you may get it , you ca n't rely upon it			0
you have to have that inner strength			0
on putting off a family until after 40 ... i think i am a better mother having done it a little bit later in life and having got to a point where my career was really on solid footing			0
how @entity132 scouts clowns , trapeze artists and gymnasts on juggling work and family life ... i had to figure out how to leave my work at work			0
i realized that all of the experience that i had and all of the expertise that i brought to the table every day gave me a certain confidence to just kind of let go and not sweat the small stuff and really just ... be able to look at the big picture and manage			0
i think as women we carry a huge amount of guilt every second of every day we are not with our children			0
i hope ultimately that they would have pride in the fact that they have a mother who loves what she does and goes to work every day happy			0
but ... it does it requires a huge amount of organization and prioritization			0
and you know i am very fortunate that i have an incredibly supportive husband			0
on commercial movies ... i think that there is ... a conception out there that those films -- because they are so commercial and because they are required to be commercial -- ca n't be creative			1
but i actually disagree with that			0
their reach is really worldwide			0
the ... visual effects component of those films is exciting to moviegoers all over the world			1
so , that 's definitely a kind of movie making that is absolutely imperative to the studios			1
on @entity6 ... there is a superficial side to it ... we are all creating a fantasy after all , every day			0
that is what we do			0
but the people behind the scenes , they are people who are going to work every day ... these are all people who are so passionate about what they are doing .			0
