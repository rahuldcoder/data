-- in a few days , people in the @entity2 and @entity3 will have reason to be jealous of what their countrymen in the @entity6 are going through now -- digging out from as much as 2 feet of snow , dealing with the effect of blizzard - level winds , and feeling the heat of below - zero temperatures			1
because as cold as it is now , it 's practically tropical compared to what 's coming			0
think lows in the -20s @entity17 across @entity18 and @entity19 , with wind chills of -50 or even more frigid , according to the @entity21			0
sunday night in @entity22 will be a brisk minus 16 to 20 , or 35 below to 45 below zero if you factor in the @entity25 's wind			0
those at @entity27 for the @entity28 vs. @entity29 49ers @entity31 game may cheer against overtime , given that the wind chill may dip to 50 below in @entity34 that night			0
as the weather service 's @entity38 , @entity19 , division warns , " exposed flesh can freeze in as little as five minutes with wind chills colder than 50 below			1
" the same agency tweeted that this system will produce " the coldest air in two decades			1
" in fact , between friday and wednesday , nearly 140 million @entity43 -- nearly half the nation -- will experience temperatures of 0 degrees @entity17 or below , according to a @entity0 calculation			1
as @entity28 head coach @entity48 said friday : " this is not the norm			1
" ' the snow was absolutely insane ' it 's not like those who braved the latest storm have it easy			0
the @entity57 spent part of friday trying to clear the driveway around his home in @entity62 , @entity63 , where the weather service said more snow -- 23.8 inches -- fell than in any other community hit by the thursday - into - friday nor'easter			1
every time he finished a spot , he 'd turn around and see it covered with snow again			0
" the snow was absolutely insane , " @entity73 said , " and totally nonstop			0
" even after the snow was done , he and others affected by this storm system were in for a tough few hours , thanks to the cold			2
temperatures in parts of @entity81 , where as much as 8 inches of snow fell , were predicted to drop to zero friday night for the first time since january 1994			1
it was also set to dip below zero , with minus 17 wind chill , in @entity86 after nearly 18 inches of snow			0
fears of widespread power outages did n't come to bear , despite blizzard - level winds in some places			0
by 5 p.m. wednesday , major utilities in @entity81 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 were reporting just over 1,100 outages , a far cry from a major nor'easter last february that knocked out electricity to more than 630,000 customers			1
as happens with such weather , there was tragedy as well			2
three people died in car accidents in @entity94 -- including one man crushed as he was moving street salt with a forklift			2
emergency management agency spokesman @entity109 said these deaths were weather - related			2
in @entity113 , @entity81 , a 71 - year - old woman wandered away from her home thursday night and was later found dead in the snow in a wooded area about 100 yards away , the @entity111 reported			2
in @entity118 , @entity93 , a calamity was averted when authorities rescued a 34 - year - old man who fell through ice in @entity122 as he tried to retrieve one of his snowshoes , said environmental protection department spokesman @entity125			1
air traffic delays abound then there were the thousands stuck at airports nationwide because of system - wide delays -- though at least they were suffering inside , not in the frigid cold			1
@entity134 , which tracks cancellations due to weather and mechanical problems , said about 3,000 flights were canceled for friday within , into or out of the @entity43			1
that 's after more than 2,600 @entity43 flights were canceled on thursday			1
though the temperature in @entity141 was 52 degrees -- above zero -- passengers there were also feeling the storm 's sting			0
long lines formed inside @entity148 at the counters for @entity150 , which had canceled many of its flights from @entity22			1
the airline carries 40 % of the airport 's passengers , according to @entity156 , an airport spokesman			0
" we are doing everything possible to get back up and running as soon as possible , " @entity150 spokesman @entity157 said on friday afternoon			2
flights resumed by late friday morning in much of @entity95 , though delays were common , and ticket holders were urged to check with their airlines			1
@entity164 had planned to fly friday from @entity165 , @entity94 , to @entity166 , @entity167 , but her flight was canceled			1
she told @entity0 affiliate @entity169 that she was on the phone with @entity171 for five hours trying to find a way to get home , but concluded she will have to wait until monday			1
" we got a warm place to stay , get to visit the kids , the grandkids , so it 's ok , " she said			0
historically cold arctic air mass this being winter , after all , there 's more snow coming -- and perhaps more delays , more accidents , and more headaches			2
one storm threatened to bring blizzard conditions to @entity18 as well as parts of @entity189 and @entity19 on friday night and saturday , the weather service said			1
and cities like @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 -- the latter of which will play host to a @entity200 vs. @entity202 @entity31 football game -- could get hit with significant snow sunday and monday			0
some areas will get some reprieve as temperatures rise in the coming days			2
but they better not get too comfortable , as the temperatures will reverse course starting sunday			2
parts of the @entity2 could see temperatures not recorded in 15 to 20 years , and for a painful stretch			0
@entity22 , for instance , could see subzero temperatures from sunday evening until wednesday			0
even areas as far south as @entity215 , @entity216 , could be basking in zero - degree cold as the arctic air mass dives southward at the beginning of next week			0
that 's not just an inconvenience : that cold is dangerous			0
and it 's why school will be canceled in places like @entity226 and the entire state of @entity19 -- areas hardly unaccustomed to @entity230 's bite -- on monday			0
" i have made this decision to protect all our children from the dangerously cold temperatures , " @entity19 gov. @entity231 said in explaining his decision to call off classes statewide			0
@entity0 's @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .			1
