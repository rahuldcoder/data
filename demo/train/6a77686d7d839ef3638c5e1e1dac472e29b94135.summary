the last time @entity2 came back from a long - term layoff , he enjoyed one of the finest seasons of an outstanding career -- reaching nine consecutive finals on his return from a knee injury , and winning both the @entity10 and @entity12 grand slams in 2013			1
on tuesday , the @entity13 took to the court for the first time in three months and looked as though he had never been away as he blitzed past @entity17 @entity16 at the @entity18			1
needing just 78 minutes to win 6 - 4 6 - 0 in the opening round , the world @entity19 appeared to feel no effects of the right wrist injury he suffered while practicing at home in @entity26 in late july			1
" in general , i have to be happy the way that i played , " @entity2 , a 14 - time grand slam winner , told the official @entity29 website			2
" after three months without a match , winning against a good player like @entity16 is a very positive comeback for me			1
i think i played solid , no mistakes			0
" @entity2 , who presented @entity35 with a bouquet of flowers as @entity38 said goodbye to its biggest tennis star on tuesday , had not played since his surprise fourth round defeat by @entity43 @entity42 at @entity44 on july 1			2
his problematic wrist meant he was unable to defend his title at this month 's @entity12 , where @entity48 's @entity47 emerged as a surprise winner			1
" more important than winning or losing is spending time on court			0
that 's the key for me at the moment : spending time on court , playing matches , " said @entity2			0
" at least i am going to play two matches minimum here			0
that 's a positive thing			0
i 'm going to try my best to play three			0
" the 28 - year - old has returned to action even though he says his wrist is not quite 100 % healed			0
@entity2 has a decent record in @entity62 -- having won the @entity18 in 2005 and @entity64 gold in 2008			1
last year , he finished runner - up as @entity66 won his fourth @entity18 title			2
the @entity68 took his record in @entity62 to 20 - 0 when beating @entity70 6 - 2 6 - 1 as @entity66 played his first match since being stunned by @entity73 's @entity72 in the @entity12 semifinal .			2
