-- online photo archive @entity1 is opening 35 million images to online publishers to use free of charge , acknowledging that many of its pictures are already being copied anyway			1
the company will allow " noncommercial " users such as bloggers and tweeters to embed its images using a code similar to what 's on sites such as @entity18			2
the image that appears will include a @entity1 photo credit and will be linked to the company 's website , where viewers can have the opportunity to license the photo			1
" this will provide people with a simple and legal way to utilize content that respects creators ' rights , including the opportunity to generate licensing revenue , " @entity26 said in a statement announcing the move			1
the decision " opens one of the largest , deepest and most comprehensive image collections in the world for easy sharing , thereby making the world an even more visual place			2
" @entity44 , @entity1 's senior vice president for business development , said @entity1 saw its content being copied online , and that " spoke to an opportunity			1
" " the use of our content in these venues points to really the fact that people are excited to be sharing their ideas , their interests , their passions with our content , " he said			2
by giving users limited access to its imagery , he said , " we 're generating new brand awareness in this market			0
" it also clarifies @entity1 's insistence that any commercial use of the company 's images requires a paid license , possibly bringing in paying customers , @entity44 said			2
and it opens up the door to using the embed code to post advertising -- a prospect already covered in @entity1 's terms of use for the new venture			2
" i think it 's a little premature to talk to a specific business model , but i think we can talk to specific benefits out of the gate , " @entity44 said			0
users will be able to choose from a universe of 35 million images out of the 150 million @entity1 has available for licensing to a wide variety of organizations , from advertising agencies to news outlets such as @entity0			1
embedded content must be used for " editorial purposes " -- meaning events that are " newsworthy or of public interest " -- and ca n't be used for advertising , the terms state			0
@entity96 , director of the @entity97 at @entity98 , said @entity1 is trying to establish " an alternative for people who otherwise would just copy and paste photos , " much as @entity103 's @entity102 created a way to legitimize music sharing			1
but the trick for @entity1 will be to allow those users to access its images without making it so easy that its paying customers start using the embed service themselves , he said			1
" @entity1 makes a lot of money off folks like the @entity115 and @entity0 and professional publishers			1
they do not in any way want to endanger that , " @entity96 said			0
" they 're trying to walk that thin line to protect that while at the same time enabling that different kind of business			1
" @entity44 said that commercial users have more rights to the images than bloggers who embed them			0
they 're able to use the images on multiple platforms , edit them and keep them on their own servers , he said			0
" it 's a completely different work product than what any of our major media companies are looking for , " he said			0
so far , news photos are harder to find in embeddable form " than a stock photo of a man in a classroom , " @entity96 said			0
but if @entity1 starts using the embedded image to post ads -- a possibility included in its terms of use -- " then you have a question about how photographers get compensated , " @entity96 said			1
@entity150 , a photographer in @entity151 , said the market for stock imagery has already declined sharply in recent years , and many photo agencies now expect photographers to pick up a larger share of their expenses			2
" i ca n't help but think that somehow @entity1 will gain something from this , but not their photographers , " @entity158 said			1
she and other photographers who commented on @entity1 's facebook page also questioned whether an ad - supported website counted as a noncommercial venture			1
" when you 're potentially making money , even if it 's not a service or a product , that 's commercial , " she said			2
" you then are benefiting from another 's work , and they are not being compensated			0
" but @entity44 said the feedback he 's received from photographers is " largely positive			0
" " we have over 200,000 photographers whose work we represent on a global basis			0
in that world , not everyone 's going to always agree with the things we do , " he said			0
but he said he met with a group of photographers wednesday night , " and they were incredibly excited about it			0

new : copying of getty photos " spoke to an opportunity , " *vp* says
