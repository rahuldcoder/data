-- why does the use of chemical weapons justify international retribution with military force , in a way that two years of brutal repression with tanks and planes does not ? and where in international law is the legal " cover " for such action ? if the @entity15 administration is planning for limited military strikes against @entity17 to hold the regime " accountable " -- in the words of senior officials -- for using chemical weapons , it is probably drafting some answers to those questions			1
the president put it like this in his @entity0 interview last week : " if the @entity29 goes in and attacks another country without a @entity32 mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented , then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it , do we have the coalition to make it work ? " forcibly intervening for humanitarian reasons , to protect innocents from appalling suffering , is a noble concept , one that would draw on the moral outrage felt around the world			1
the thrust of president @entity15 's argument has always been humanitarian : that using chemical weapons , which are horrendous and indiscriminate by nature , would cross a " red line			1
" who wants what after chemical weapons horror @entity29 secretary of state @entity55 amplified the argument monday when he said , " president @entity15 believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world 's most heinous weapons against the world 's most vulnerable people			1
" in other words , the " strictly legal " should not be allowed to cancel out a legitimate and necessary course of action , even if international law provides no clear support for intervention on humanitarian grounds			1
@entity71 , the @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 have all signaled support for such an approach			2
" the international community must act should the use of such weapons be confirmed , " says @entity74 foreign minister @entity77			2
but in this instance , the international community is likely to mean @entity83 , not the @entity32 , and that would carry much less weight in international law			1
missile strikes on @entity17 likely response to chemical attack pre-emptive force to protect @entity29 allies @entity92 , who worked in the @entity93 at the @entity94 for a decade , wrote on the @entity96 blog that the @entity29 " might believe that a @entity17 use of chemical weapons is likely to affect neighboring ( and friendly ) states such as @entity73 and @entity100 , " depending on where they were used			1
@entity103 , who held a similar position at the @entity72 @entity105 , adds that the request by @entity73 for @entity111 missile batteries last year " suggests the possibility of a collective self - defence rationale for military intervention to address such a threat			2
" this argument for " anticipatory " self - defense , to take out something before it is used against you or your allies , is gaining favor in light of the nuclear programs being developed by @entity120 and @entity121 and the unpredictable nature of the global terrorist threat			0
after 9/11 , the @entity125 administration fashioned a national security strategy that included and justified the use of pre-emptive force			2
" we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the @entity29 and our allies and friends , " the 2002 document said			0
@entity15 hinted at this argument in an interview with @entity0 last week			0
" when you start seeing chemical weapons used on a large scale ... that starts getting to some core national interests that the @entity29 has , both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating , as well as needing to protect our allies , our bases in the region			1
" intervening in @entity151 turmoil : mission impossible ? intervening in @entity153 some observers have invoked the precedent of @entity83 's 78 days of bombardment against @entity158 forces in @entity153 and in @entity158 in 1999			0
the alliance argued that as a regional grouping , it had the right to intervene in @entity153 to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and protect the stability of @entity158 's neighbors			2
" we can not stand by and let the @entity158 crack down again on the @entity167 , " said then - @entity94 spokesman @entity165			0
" we believe that is a substantial and legitimate grounds for action internationally			2
" even so , @entity29 and @entity83 officials , from then - secretary of state @entity171 down , argued later that @entity153 should not be seen as a precedent			0
the @entity94 's legal adviser at the time , @entity175 , talked about a " unique combination of a number of factors " and insisted the @entity29 and its allies did not see humanitarian intervention as the legal basis for the @entity153 campaign			1
in the case of @entity17 , neither the @entity32 charter nor the @entity184 is likely to offer much cover for intervention			1
the charter forbids the " use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state " but allows for the use of force in self - defense			0
@entity197 51 reads , in part : " nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self - defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the @entity32			0
" this would be known -- in @entity32 parlance -- as a @entity208 resolution , and was the basis for intervention in the @entity211 and after @entity213 's invasion of @entity214			2
it was also used , more controversially , to sanction military intervention in @entity217 in 2011 as it appeared @entity218 was on the verge of a bloodbath			2
@entity221 authorized member states " to take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack " in @entity217			0
but it seems very unlikely that the @entity29 and other like - minded governments could convince @entity230 and @entity231 that @entity232 applies in the case of @entity17			2
both @entity233 and @entity234 were angered that the resolution that green - lit the intervention in @entity217 in 2011 -- enforcing a no - fly zone on humanitarian grounds -- fast became the fig leaf for a campaign to remove @entity241			1
they have no intention of issuing another carte blanche			0
' red line ' debate : are chemical weapons in @entity17 worse than attacks ? @entity249 specifically on the use of chemical weapons , there is the 1925 @entity249 , drawn up after mustard and other asphyxiating gas attacks in the trenches during @entity256 is a party to the protocol , so it is bound not to use chemical weapons in war			1
open to argument is whether " war " includes internal conflict , but there is a growing body of international law that suggests it does			1
the statute of the @entity269 recognizes conflicts " that take place in the territory of a state when there is protracted armed conflict between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups			0
" and the @entity279 for the former @entity280 held that " there undisputedly emerged a general consensus in the international community on the principle that the use of ( chemical ) weapons is also prohibited in internal armed conflicts			1
" after two years of carnage in @entity17 , there is a lively debate under way about whether the use of chemical weapons is a game changer			1
as @entity295 put it in the @entity297 in april , " it 's more than just @entity17 : it 's about every war that comes after , about what kind of warfare the world is willing to allow , about preserving the small but crucial gains we 've made over the last century in constraining warfare in its most terrible forms			1
" @entity308 spokesman @entity307 stressed " this specific violation of international norms " on monday			0
" why should the @entity29 be willing to intervene if chemical weapons kill 1,000 civilians , but not if ordinary weapons kill tens of thousands ? " @entity315 asked tuesday on the blog @entity317			1
@entity318 : stay out of @entity17 's civil war selective @entity29 intervention and history shows the @entity29 has been selective in intervening , or even condemning , previous use of chemical weapons			1
@entity324 used chemical weapons not only against the @entity327 civilians of @entity328 in 1988 but frequently as a weapon of war against @entity120 troops			1
and the @entity29 , according to a well - sourced article in " @entity333 " this week , was complicit in those attacks			0
" the @entity213 never told us that they intended to use nerve gas			0
they did n't have to			0
we already knew , " said @entity337 , who was the @entity29 military attache in @entity339 in 1988			0
anxious that @entity120 troops were about to make a strategic breakthrough , " @entity29 intelligence officials conveyed the location of the @entity120 troops to @entity213 , fully aware that @entity324 's military would attack with chemical weapons , including sarin , a lethal nerve agent , " wrote @entity340 and @entity341 in " foreign policy			1
" and they cite a top - secret document drawn up at the @entity352 at the time			0
" if the @entity213 produce or acquire large new supplies of mustard agent , they almost certainly would use it against @entity120 troops and towns near the border			0
" finally , there is the @entity362 , which holds that only @entity363 can declare war and only @entity363 can appropriate the funds to wage war			0
the last time such niceties were observed was for @entity29 's entrance into @entity370 the 1973 @entity371 requires the president to notify @entity363 within 48 hours of launching military action and bars @entity29 armed forces from fighting for more than 60 days without congressional approval			1
that may be 58 days longer than any action against @entity17			2
when the @entity217 campaign began , @entity15 simply informed @entity363 that it was " to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and address the threat posed to international peace and security by the crisis in @entity217			2
" an attempt by rep. @entity385 , @entity386 , to invoke the @entity371 went nowhere			0
when it comes to punishing the @entity17 regime -- if it is proved to have used chemical weapons -- arguments over what is legal or legitimate recall a famous passage from " @entity394			1
" " when i use a word , " @entity395 said in rather a scornful tone , " it means just what i choose it to mean -- neither more nor less			0
" " the question is , " said @entity402 , " whether you can make words mean so many different things			0

president has said that @entity17 's use of chemical weapons would cross a " red line "
administration might be asking : what justifies military action , and where 's legal cover for it ?
international law provides no clear support for intervention on humanitarian grounds
@entity17 is bound by the @entity249 , but does that cover internal conflict ?
