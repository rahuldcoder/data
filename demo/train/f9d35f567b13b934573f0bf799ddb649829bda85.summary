@entity13 to the world ! " it 's obvious what he 's implying			0
the new " @entity4 " is due out december 18 , 2015 , and if @entity2 ' opinion means anything , it 'll be more highly thought - of than @entity21 , " @entity8 , " which has long been hailed as the best of the " @entity4 " movies -- and one of the best sequels of all time			1
