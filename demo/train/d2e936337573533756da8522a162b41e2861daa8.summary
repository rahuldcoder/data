-- in the run - up to the party conventions , new attention has been focused on women 's issues in the political sphere			1
it has been accompanied by claims that the @entity9 is somehow unfriendly to women -- which will be a surprise to the thousands of women attending the convention in @entity14 , @entity15			1
having served 19 years in the @entity17 , and as a lifelong @entity9 , i have some perspective			1
much of the recent debate has focused on a narrow slice of what constitutes women 's issues and how gender should direct women 's views			1
but this is overly simplistic			0
women make up half of the most diverse country in the world			2
we are represented ethnically , socially , racially , economically , religiously and ideologically across the spectrum			0
to say that there is a set of concerns that can be labeled " women 's issues " is absolutely true			1
to assume that we all feel the same way about them -- or that we must feel the same way about them to represent our gender legitimately -- is inherently sexist			0
my experiences as a woman certainly inform my perspective , but they do not wholly define my political views			0
i am also guided by the values my family instilled and the educational opportunities i had growing up			2
that we employ different methods and points of view does not mean that one or the other party is the natural place for women			2
opinion : wake up : it 's not just @entity61 women are , in fact , more than our gender			1
we are entrepreneurs and executives who are concerned about a faltering economy and business - unfriendly regulation			1
we are homemakers and heads of households who worry what tax hikes will do to our family budgets			0
we are parents who want the best education possible for our children			0
we are recent graduates , entering the bleakest job market in decades			0
we are retirees , worried about the shaky finances of @entity85 and @entity86			0
i am a @entity9 because i believe that the best opportunities for women -- and men , and children -- come from a thriving economy that encourages entrepreneurship and promotes business development to create jobs and financial security			1
in the dismal fiscal state we 're in , i think that is what is most important to women , and i consider the economy to be a women 's issue			1
but even if we look to the more traditional women 's issues , as a @entity9 , i have worked on them my entire career			1
none of it could have been achieved without the support of my party			0
in 1975 , when i was serving in the @entity110 , i authored legislation that guaranteed the most far - reaching protections for rape victims in the country , including limiting invasive personal questions that had been part of a " blame the victim " culture and redefining consent			0
that bill became the model for strengthened victim - protection laws throughout the country			0
sen. @entity123 , @entity124 , and i sponsored the @entity125 , allowing spouses who do not work outside the home -- the vast majority of them women -- to defer taxes in individual retirement accounts			2
@entity123 and i worked together again to co-sponsor the @entity131 and @entity132			2
more recently , all the female senators -- democrats and @entity9 -- joined together in opposing the @entity136 's recommendation that women under 50 forgo breast cancer screening			1
opinion : why @entity140 is not ' bad ' for women during this year 's debate on reauthorization of the @entity144 , i offered an amendment to enact harsher penalties for violent sexual offenses and to address the backlog of some 400,000 untested sexual - assault kits			2
although the amendment was not approved , the final reauthorization -- again , supported unanimously by the female senators -- included new anti- cyber-stalking legislation that i worked on with sen. @entity155 , @entity156			0
the debate over the @entity144 was a reminder that , though we may disagree on policy particulars , the female senators find ways to solve problems when it matters most			0
but my definition of women 's issues extends further			1
as the ranking member on the @entity169 , for instance , i believe the @entity172 disciplines -- science , technology , engineering and medicine -- must be encouraged for our girls			0
getting more women into these professions reflects both my will to advance women and my @entity9 ethos : these areas are vital to @entity185 's economic success , and i believe ignoring 50 % of the talent pool is detrimental to that goal			1
@entity185 have thoughts , opinions and ideas spanning the political spectrum , about which reasonable people can respectfully disagree			1
but it is both unreasonable and disrespectful to demand that half of them hold identical views simply because of their gender			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

some people claim the @entity9 is unfriendly to women , says @entity201
as a @entity185 senator for 19 years and a lifelong @entity9 , she disagrees
the best opportunities for women come from a thriving economy , she says
@entity201 says she has worked on traditional women 's issues her entire career
