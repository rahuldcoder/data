-- in the heart of @entity3 , the vibrant and resilient capital of @entity4 , a slow and colorful transformation is taking place			1
once ugly and industrial , the historic neighborhood of @entity7 has emerged in recent years as the thriving epicenter of the city 's cultural life			1
following decades of neglect , @entity7 is now blossoming back to life as a diverse crowd of artists and entrepreneurs have poured in to reclaim the area and transform its run - down warehouses and abandoned spaces into hubs of creativity			1
at the center of this urban remake is @entity24 , a previously derelict state - owned garage that has now become a booming cultural space showcasing the best of @entity29 art , thought and design			0
" it 's a roof for many different activities , " says @entity31 , the creative force behind @entity24			0
" it 's basically connecting creative people of very different disciplines but with a similar goal and desire to be productive and constructive , " continues @entity31 , an @entity34 - educated architect			0
" these small - scale skills of surviving and being able to make something out of nothing , this kind of bitter - sweet attitude to life , and we used to say ' who if not us , ' and ' when if not now			0
' " @entity49 history such a transformation is not new in @entity3 , a city that has been destroyed and rebuilt some 40 times throughout its long and tumultuous history			1
lying at the confluence of the great @entity55 and @entity56 rivers , @entity3 -- home today for some 1.5 million people -- is strategically located at the crossroads between @entity60 and @entity61 and a meeting point of different civilizations			1
nowhere is @entity3 's historical and cultural significance more evident than in the imposing ancient fortress that towers over the point where the @entity55 and @entity56 rivers mingle			1
standing in some form since the second century on top of a cliff - like ridge , the sprawling castle has over the years sheltered @entity4 , @entity72 , @entity74 and @entity75 troops -- to name just a few			2
" @entity3 was so many times conquered , pulled down and built again , so , that is why we have so many layers and every of those people left its marks on the ground of this city , " says art historian @entity76 , surrounded by a cluster of ancient statues and elaborate headstones that dot an old gunpowder storage room deep inside the fortress			1
breathtaking scenery now a historical monument that encompasses a large park , the fortress is a popular destination for locals and tourists thanks to its charming walking paths and spectacular river views			0
it 's also the ideal location for @entity99 , the owner / pilot of @entity101 , who often comes here to fly his camera - mounted drone and capture @entity3 's grand picture -- as well as its continuous rebuilding			2
" when i was kid i always dreamed how it would be nice to be able to fly and to see what birds can see , and with this equipment , my dreams came true , " says @entity99 , adding that the breathtaking shots give people more pride in their city			0
" people are very proud to live in this city and to see it from another angle , " he says			0
