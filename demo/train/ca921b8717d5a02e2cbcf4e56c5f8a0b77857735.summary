@entity0 -- a @entity6 @entity5 woman suffered religious discrimination when @entity8 told her not to wear a visible cross over her uniform , a top @entity3 court ruled tuesday			1
however , three other @entity6 @entity5 lost related religious discrimination claims at the @entity12			1
belief blog : @entity6 fights @entity5 ' right to wear cross , infuriating activists @entity8 violated the article of the @entity19 that guarantees freedom of religion when it stopped employee @entity21 from wearing her cross openly , the court said			1
@entity24 said she experienced discrimination from 2006 to 2007 , when she started displaying the cross while working as a member of check - in staff			1
she was first sent home and then offered another role where she 'd have no contact with customers			0
she refused to take it			0
the airline changed its policy on uniforms in 2007 to allow employees to wear religious or charity symbols , at which time @entity24 returned to the check - in desk			2
in its ruling , the court weighed @entity24 's desire to show her religious belief against the airline 's wish to project a certain corporate image			2
" while this aim was undoubtedly legitimate , the domestic courts accorded it too much weight , " it said , referring to @entity8 ' position			0

they are nurse @entity57 , who also wanted to wear a cross at work , registrar @entity60 , who declined to register gay civil partnerships , and @entity64 , a relationship counselor who did not want to give sex therapy to same - sex couples			1
in the case of @entity57 , the court ruled that the concerns of hospital managers for health and safety outweighed the nurse 's desire to wear a cross visibly in the workplace			2
the cases of the registrar and the relationship counselor had been fairly considered in the national courts , the court said			0
" in each case the employer was pursuing a policy of nondiscrimination against service - users , and the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of sexual orientation was also protected under the @entity19			0
" the parties in the cases have three months in which to lodge an appeal			0

" @entity103 said he was " amazed " by the court 's decision , and added that there had been no need for him to be dismissed from his job			0
" what happened to me was deeply illiberal			0
i simply wanted to do my job in light of my @entity5 identity but i was policed and punished for my thoughts , for my beliefs			1
in a truly tolerant society we make room for one another , " the @entity96 quoted him as saying			0
" today 's judgment is a worrying sign not just for those who bring their @entity5 faith to bear on their work but for all those who hold viewpoints that differ from the reigning orthodoxy			1
" rights groups hailed the outcome , however			0
@entity133 , director of the @entity135 human rights group , said the judgment was " an excellent result for equal treatment , religious freedom and common sense			1
" the @entity6 courts had " lost their way " in considering @entity24 's case , she said			2
" @entity21 was n't hurting anyone and was perfectly capable of doing her job whilst wearing a small cross			1
she had just as much a right to express her faith as a @entity151 man in a turban or a @entity154 woman with a headscarf			0
" but , @entity133 added , the @entity3 court " was also right to uphold judgments in other cases that employers can expect staff not to discriminate in the discharge of duties at work			0
" the @entity164 also praised the @entity3 court for " applying the right principles " to the cases -- those of equality and human rights			2
the association 's chief executive , @entity169 , said the political @entity5 lobby and socially conservative media had sought to whip up a " victim narrative " around the cases that had no basis in reality			2
" what they describe as discrimination and marginalization of @entity5 is in fact the proper upholding of human rights and equalities law and principles -- principles which protect all people against unfair treatment -- and we are pleased that the court has recognized this , " he said in a statement			1
" all reasonable people will agree that there is scope in a secular democracy for reasonable accommodation of religious beliefs when that accommodation does not affect the rights and freedoms of others			1
" the four @entity5 turned to the @entity12 in @entity202 , @entity203 , after losing every round of their battles through the @entity6 legal system			1
their claims were filed under @entity3 human rights law , focusing on guarantees of freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination at work			1
the cases have been closely watched in @entity3 because they may help to draw a clear boundary in cases where religious views contradict laws against discrimination			2
the court 's decisions have implications across 47 countries on the continent			0
the court ruling will not be binding in @entity6 , but the country is legally obliged to take it into account			0
@entity1 's @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .			0
