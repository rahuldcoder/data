-- robots can be many things -- knowledgeable , dexterous , strong			2
but can they ever be genuinely laugh - out - loud hilarious ? " if you prick us in our battery pack , do we not bleed alkaline fluid ? " asks @entity4 the robot , haltingly throwing up its arms in its best impression of a real - life comedian			1
truth be told , if @entity4 were a human it 'd be dying on stage			1
the cute little machine 's monotone voice has all the drama of a conveyer belt , while its expression is as vacant as a doll			2
comedic timing is hard to master -- particularly when you have no emotions			0
luckily for @entity4 , sitting beside it is comedy sidekick -- and programmer -- @entity29			1
the living , breathing 31 - year - old engineer heads a theater and robotics collective called @entity34			0
the group runs everything from a @entity37 , to @entity38 , and stand - up alongside poor old @entity4			1
" i fell in love with the idea that we could collaborate between the arts and robotics , " explains @entity29 , originally from @entity40 and now a doctorate student at @entity43 's @entity42 in @entity44			1
" i was looking for a way to do a performance with a robot , and i was like ' hey , what about a comedy routine on stage ? ' that way you could make jokes and get real - time feedback along the way , " she says with infectious fast - talking enthusiasm			1
funny business the unlikely partnership between researcher and robot is not without friction -- at one stage @entity4 informs us @entity29 has been " cheating " on it			1
" i caught her collecting videos of other robots , " says the knee - high " @entity76 " robot , created by @entity73 robotics company @entity71 , and popularly used as a learning aid in universities			1
" i do n't feel pain , " says blank - faced @entity4			2
" but still , that does not compute			0
i confronted her and she claims she needs to do research with other machines to improve my response capabilities			0
" there 's only one way to win @entity29 back , it seems			2
and that 's through some aptly robotic dance moves			0
indeed , @entity4 's charm lies in its very " robot - ness " -- which has more in common with human comedy than you might think			1
" when it talks about its ' perception capabilities still being in development ' -- that gets a laugh almost every single time , " explained @entity29 , who programs all of @entity4 's dialogue and movements herself			1
" people love when it goes all super-techy and acts like a real robot			2
" one of the things i 've learned from interviewing comedians over the years , is that part of what makes a performance compelling is authenticity			0
if you 're going to be a comedian , you need to bring material from yourself			0
" intelligent interaction and like all good comedians , @entity4 must read the crowd			2
in this case , that involves programming the machine to pick up on social cues like clapping and even smiling			2
" things like laughter , applause , these are symbolic things that we all do , " says @entity29			1
" so when you 're in a theater you can have hundreds of people that are also data points			0
" in the past i 've given the audience feedback cards that were red on one side and green on the other , so they could explicitly tell the robot through its vision whether something was working or not			2
" regardless of @entity4 's comedic powers , the adorable bot could one day influence the " personalities " of other machines			1
" for example , if you had a robot that 's delivering juice boxes in a pre-school , then you 'd want it to be pretty warm , " explained @entity29			1
" but if you have a robot that 's a security guard in a garage at night , with some suspicious people hanging around , then being a little intimidating can totally be appropriate			0
" sweet science while other engineers compete to create the most human - like robot ever , @entity29 says they might be better off making machines that " we just really like having around			1
" " there 's all these different relationships we have with technology now -- frustration with our software updates , or bonding with our cars to the point of naming them , " she said			0
" so it can be refreshing to have a piece of technology actually making fun of its self , rather than just inconveniencing us when it 's supposed to be improving our lives			0
" @entity4 's unique comedy act is n't just a research project -- it 's an important teaching tool , with @entity29 's @entity178 attracting over 600,000 views online			1
" when the robot makes fun of me , it means i can tell you about my research and it 's like my own self - deprecation , " explained the bubbly engineer , and you get the feeling her popularity is not just down to @entity4 , but her own charismatic stage presence			1
" it 's the spoonful of sugar that makes the education go down			0
" one thing 's for sure , science class would have been a whole lot more interesting with these two at the front			0
" they call me ginger the robot , gosh i love saying that			0
it makes me feel like some sort of super hero , " says the miniature machine with a jerky swivel of the head			0
" but actually i am just a mediocre robotic comedian			0
" boom ! boom ! quiz : 10 female scientists you should know @entity209 : how do we get girls into @entity212 ? design : the mosque architect breaking the mold			0

*introducing* the human and robot comedy *duo* with a difference
researcher @entity29 and @entity4 the robot perform on stage
machine picks up on audiences responses like laughter and applause
could shape the personalities of robots in the *future*
