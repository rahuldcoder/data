@entity9 's rugged terrain intensified the effect of the storm			2

" @entity4 has also suffered from severe rain this summer			0
a violent rainstorm in @entity130 last month caused the worst flooding in the @entity16 capital in decades , killing at least 77 people and provoking criticism from residents about the city 's infrastructure and response to the disaster			1
heavy rain elsewhere in @entity4 has left dozens more people dead , filled rivers and lakes to dangerous levels and forced the authorities to step up emergency preparations			2
