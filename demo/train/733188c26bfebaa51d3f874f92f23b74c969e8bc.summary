implemented last month , after @entity3 president @entity25 signed it into effect , the law bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear			1
it has been condemned by @entity3 and international rights groups as highly discriminatory			2

" but in a meeting wednesday with all out representatives , senior @entity12 staff said they would pursue a stronger , written commitment from the @entity3 government on the issue , @entity42 told @entity0			2

@entity109 grows over anti-gay propaganda laws vodka boycott there has been a groundswell of international concern over the anti-gay propaganda law and its potential impact on visitors to @entity3 for the @entity24			1
protests have ranged from a number of bars around the world announcing a boycott of @entity3 vodka to calls from some quarters for a boycott of the @entity24 themselves			2
all out hopes its petition will encourage world leaders to put pressure on @entity3 to change its treatment of the lgbt community and to ensure equal rights for all @entity3 citizens before and after the @entity24 , @entity42 said			1
" unless the @entity17 set an example of the rights and freedoms being exercised without prejudice , the discriminatory @entity140 law will serve to punish people simply for being open about who they are and who they love , " @entity136 , from the @entity137 in @entity138 , is quoted by all out as saying			2
" we continue our call for world leaders , including the @entity12 , to speak out now before it is too late			0
" asked tuesday on @entity156 's " @entity154 with @entity155 " about @entity3 's treatment of the gay community , president @entity44 said he had " no patience " with it			1

" and i have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them			0
" on wednesday , the @entity181 cited a " lack of progress " on human rights and civil society , among other issues , as a reason for canceling planned bilateral talks between @entity44 and @entity25 next month			0
banks , of all out , said @entity44 had " really got the message right			0
