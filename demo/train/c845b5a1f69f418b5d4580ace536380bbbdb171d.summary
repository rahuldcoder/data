@entity0 -- president @entity3 's final campaign is n't turning into much of a victory lap. his role in next week 's midterm elections , which amount to the last important contest of his political career , has been to quietly rake in campaign cash for the @entity13 party , rather than headline the stadium rallies he became famous for in 2008 and 2012			1
the final week before the midterm elections is slated to be @entity3 's busiest , though the eleventh - hour politicking will only take the president to states that went his direction in 2008 and 2012			1
he 'll campaign mostly for governors , whose role outside @entity0 puts them further from the unpopular @entity26 policies that give @entity13 @entity28 candidates heartburn			1
the objective : turning out democrats who do n't have a great record voting in midterm contests			0
his lone stop for a @entity28 candidate comes in @entity35 on saturday for @entity37 @entity36 , currently running ten points ahead of @entity40 rival @entity39			2
@entity41 stopped spending ad money there weeks ago			0
@entity3 's truncated campaign schedule only reflects how big a drag the unpopular commander - in - chief is on his party 's most vulnerable @entity28 candidates			1
the electoral calendar has left @entity13 uniquely positioned to lose control of the upper chamber , a fact party insiders are already citing ahead of potential losses			2
related : @entity28 races in 2014 related : @entity1 / @entity56 poll - voters are angry in @entity40 - leaning states like @entity58 and @entity59 , @entity13 are scrambling to keep seats amid near - record lows in @entity3 's approval ratings			1
@entity13 senators are working to convince swing electorates that @entity3 's policies are n't necessarily their own in @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			2
and in @entity40 strongholds like @entity72 and @entity73 , @entity13 candidates are quick to promise total independence from an unpopular @entity26			1
that leaves @entity3 with few options to return to the campaign trail â€” his last opportunity as president			1
on tuesday he flew to @entity80 , where the @entity81 gov. @entity81 is virtually tied with his @entity13 challenger @entity82 in a race that 's focused largely on the state 's economy			0
it 's one of the nation 's marquee governor 's race -- one @entity13 desperately want to win -- and the highest - profile contest to feature a visit from @entity3			1
that @entity92 , a former @entity93 bicycle executive , does n't have to answer for an @entity3 - aligned voting record makes a visit from the president tenable			2
and with a statewide approval figure of 51 % , according to a recent @entity99 survey , @entity3 's in far better shape in @entity80 than he is nationwide			2
related : @entity28 math seems impossible to some democrats " the goal of the visit is to persuade the once - every - four - year voters to vote this time , " said @entity103 , a professor of governmental affairs at the @entity104			0
" in @entity80 politics , the higher the turnout , the more it skews @entity13			0
the lower the turnout , the more it tilts @entity40			0
so this is [ @entity92 's ] effort to increase the size of the pie rather than fighting over the small remaining undecided slice of the current pie			0
" @entity3 's other stops this week -- thursday in @entity119 for @entity13 gubernatorial candidate @entity120 , friday in @entity121 for remarks targeting women voters , and sunday in @entity124 for @entity13 gov. @entity125 -- are also meant to turn out @entity13 in states where he still remains somewhat popular			2
in @entity119 , @entity3 's objective will be to get @entity13 voters to " act like @entity13 , " said @entity129 , a political science professor at the @entity130 in @entity119 , citing past elections there that have seen independent candidates shave away support from @entity13			1
" in essence , this is a case where the question is less about matters of public policy , and more about energy and enthusiasm behind @entity120 rather than the independent -- the @entity13 have built some but need to keep it up another week			0
the president 's visit should help with that , " @entity129 said			0
the same dynamic exists in @entity124 , where @entity3 hopes to help @entity149 pull ahead in a tied race with @entity151 , a former @entity152 ambassador to @entity153			0
the president 's only other campaign stops this cycle , on a single sunday this month in @entity157 and @entity158 , were both convened with the aim of turning out @entity161 voters in states already dyed blue			0
the @entity26 , which says its main focus is on combatting @entity164 and stopping the spread of @entity166 , has said @entity3 is " psyched " for his return to the campaign trail , no matter how diminished his role			1
and they note that next week 's results will be pinned to the president , no matter the outcome			0
" i feel confident predicting in advance is that the president will at least get some credit if @entity13 hold onto the majority in the @entity28 and he 'll get more than his fair share of the blame if they do n't , " press secretary @entity180 said monday .			1

president @entity3 has not been visible on the campaign trail for his final midterm election as president
his low approval ratings could be a drag for some @entity13 in *key* @entity28 races
the president will travel to help @entity13 candidates for governor
