-- @entity2 's parents and older brother fled @entity4 by boat in 1975 -- in the chaotic and violent final days before @entity6 fell to communist forces from the north			1
the family emigrated to a small town in @entity11 , where @entity2 was born , but the story of how the family escaped 38 years ago this month became part of the family lore -- real - life bedtime stories of daring and danger young @entity2 never tired of hearing			1
three decades later , @entity2 started his own company , @entity19 ( pronounced sky - voo ) entertainment , and used these stories as his inspiration for a mobile game called " @entity24			1
" " @entity25 is a sci - fi journey from one end of futuristic @entity28 to the other end , " @entity2 said			1
" it kind of parallels the story my family tells of moving from @entity4 to @entity28 , that treacherous journey			1
they 've always told me that story throughout childhood			0
" since it launched in 2009 , mobile gamers have downloaded " @entity24 " more than 24 million times			1
@entity19 has grown from three employees to 35 and counting			0
two " @entity24 " game soundtrack albums sell on @entity42 , and the @entity44 company is now working on a web series with @entity46			1
@entity2 's goal is to create an entertainment empire , starting with the @entity24 -- cartoon characters compared in the gaming press both to the @entity51 and @entity52			1
at 37 , @entity2 is an unlikely tech entrepreneur			1
he grew up in @entity53 , @entity11 , far from the tech and entertainment hubs of @entity56 and @entity57			0
his parents , who left a successful coffee - and - tea business behind in @entity4 , worked as janitors , initially			1
the family lived in a house not far from @entity65 's boyhood home			1
" whenever they did ' @entity65 comes home , ' i remember that tv crew coming to town			0
it was the biggest thing ever to happen to @entity53 , i think			0
that was my first encounter with entertainment , " @entity2 said			2
one of the benefits of his father 's job was paper			0
his father would come home with reams of paper from the hospital where he worked			0
" that was some of my fondest memories because we would set the reams of paper on the table at the beginning of the evening , we would roll it out and my brother and i would draw out war scenes and weapons and vehicles until our hands could n't draw anymore , " @entity2 said			2
@entity2 's mother eventually became a seamstress and his father earned a college degree in computer science			1
his older brother , @entity100 , joined the @entity101 , rising to the rank of captain before co-founding @entity19 with @entity2 in 2008			2
@entity2 recalls being a lackluster student , but says he could always draw and tell stories			2
he received a master 's degree in animation at @entity109 and worked on the @entity111 - nominated animated film " @entity112 " before starting @entity19 in the basement of a rented home in suburban @entity44			2
" i decided i could spend all my time toiling away in the film industry trying to make my characters realized , or i could start something on my own and aim for a smaller screen , " @entity2 says			2
he funded @entity19 out of pocket , with help from friends and family , before pitching his idea to @entity124 , a group of local venture capitalists			0
he received his first outside investment of just under $ 500,000 -- a sum that 's not huge by dotcom startup standards but one that made a huge difference for @entity19			0
" i get my hard work ethic from my dad and from mom and from my older brother , but i also have a bit of creativity and rebelliousness that helps fuel the company , " said @entity2			2
@entity2 is @entity19 's ceo			1
his brother remains on the board of directors , but is not involved in day - to - day activities			0
in " @entity24 , " the bears roam the galaxy trying to keep it safe from threats in a manner that 's both cute and quirky			1
chief among their foes are @entity149 , pink bears that hug the battle bears to death unless the characters shoot their heads off first -- prompting rainbows to spew from their bodies			0
" we have very cute bears and they are in very fantastic , wild situations			0
so they have to ' macguyver ' their way out with very unique weapons , " @entity2 said			0
" and that 's part of the beauty of the brands			0
it 's the wackiness , combined with just a little bit of violence for dramatic effect			0
" walking among the game developers , the space festooned with posters , drawings and @entity175 renderings , @entity2 becomes animated talking about new characters , new weapons and new games in the works			1
