@entity0 , @entity1 -- my partner and i recently took our mothers to @entity7 for a week for @entity8			2
it 's not our favorite city , but for a pair of 60 - somethings who can sit at the penny slot machines for hours , it was heaven			2
when they were not being robbed by one - armed bandits , we saw a couple of shows and had some amazing dinners			2
we also enjoyed trying to figure out which women were hookers and which were just dressed like one			2
and of course saying " public drunkenness " is pretty redundant after 11 a.m. but that 's why we go to @entity7 , right ? life on the @entity26			0
what happens here stays here ... and all that good stuff			0
by the end of our trip , the four of us had seen just about everything you would expect to see in a place nicknamed @entity37 -- except for faith - based protesters			0
funny , a week of walking up and down the main artery of the self - proclaimed heart of moral debauchery , and nary a @entity44 verse could be heard			1
in the many times i 've been to @entity7 over the years , i 've never seen a religious protest			0
and yet let a midsize city try to add sexual orientation to its municipal nondiscrimination policy or a high school senior bring a same - gender date to prom , and you would think it was the apocalypse			0
the @entity44 does n't state that one sin is greater than another , but you would n't know that by counting the number of comments that quote @entity60 on news stories about the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community			1
compare them with how many address murder , or the environment , or the wars in @entity69 and @entity70 , and well , the word " hypocrite " comes to mind			2
i am never ashamed to say i follow the teachings of @entity75 , but i am not always proud to say i am a @entity76			0
that 's because i am bothered by the continual mutilation of my religion 's basic principle of love by the extremists in my religion who construct a hierarchy of sin -- which does not exist in the @entity44 -- for no other reason than to protect their own prejudices			1
we 've seen this throughout this country 's history , and perhaps with the exception of abortion , no current issue illustrates this transgression more so than gay rights			0
some conservatives might attend church only twice a year , but ask their opinion about gays in the military			1
they can find @entity102 18:22 blindfolded , handcuffed and sinking underwater : " thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind ; it is an abomination			1
" rarely do you hear them mention the other " sexual sins " in @entity102 , such as making love to your wife while she 's menstruating			1
there are some people who say @entity75 freed us from the old laws with one side of their mouths while using old laws to condemn @entity121 people with the other			2
many turn to the destruction of @entity125 as proof against homosexuality			0
but the @entity129 version lists fornication , greed and lying as sins committed in @entity125 as well , and never specifies which particular sin caused @entity135 's wrath			2
in fact , the word " @entity125 , " which some like to toss around as an anti-gay insult , is a mistranslation and is not used in the original @entity142 text			0
the actual word is " kadesh , " and it does not refer to the city , its inhabitants or a specific sexual act			0
it refers to the occult male prostitutes in the shrines , just as " kedesha " refers to the female equivalent			0
neither word reflects sexual orientation			0
it may be convenient to say @entity125 was all about homosexual people , but historically and scripturally , that is n't accurate			2
this is why i , like so many other @entity76 , do not follow a literal interpretation of the @entity44			1
i 'm not ducking @entity102 , i 'd just rather go directly to the source			1
concepts get lost in translation , and we all know history is filled with influential people and institutions that have defined religion for the masses based upon their own selfish needs			0
for example , king @entity171 , the man who authorized the first @entity173 translation of the @entity44 , was married six times and essentially had the @entity176 separate from the @entity177 so he could divorce in peace			1
then there 's @entity129 , whose own writings suggest he was secretly gay or bisexual , according to historians such as @entity183 and @entity184			0
he was directed to marry for the sake of the throne before authorizing the version of the @entity44 that swapped " kadesh " for " sodomite " in the first place			1
hmm , where have we heard that story -- closeted gay politician with an anti-gay policy -- before ? but theology and history aside , it is clear from the lack of consistent reaction to and organization against the litany of other present - day sins that a large number of people who call themselves @entity76 do not follow the literal interpretation of the @entity44 either			1
so , if some of us are picking and choosing which @entity44 verses to follow , why are so many opting to pick and choose verses that appear to condemn homosexuality and not the one against marrying a woman who is n't a virgin ? if sin is sin , why such @entity76 angst directed at the @entity121 community and not the greedy corporate community , which , quite frankly , has more direct impact on the average person 's life ? the answer is simple : those who are uncomfortable or fearful of someone who is different from them sometimes hide behind religion to gain power , nurture their ignorance and justify their prejudices			1
it 's no different from @entity76 slave owners using scriptures to feel better about enslaving @entity232 , or men pointing to @entity234 as a way to keep women out of the clergy , or @entity238 picking verses that supported the school 's ban on interracial dating			0
the extremists are n't fighting gay rights because of sin and honoring @entity102 18:22			1
if they were , then where are the faith - based organizations spending millions trying to make adultery a crime punishable by death , as suggested in @entity102 20:10 ? is 18:22 more true than 20:10 , or does it just support a more common and entrenched prejudice ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity256 .			1

@entity256 : the @entity44 does n't state one sin is greater than another ; sin is sin .
conservatives do n't use @entity60 to condemn murder , he says , but often do against gays
@entity256 : some rarely attend church , but they can find @entity102 18:22 blindfolded
@entity60 says marrying a woman who is n't a virgin is sin , he writes , so why no outrage ?
