@entity0 -- a federal court challenge to a new @entity5 law aimed at curbing illegal immigration is n't out of the question , attorney general @entity2 said tuesday			1
@entity2 said that the @entity8 was working with the @entity9 to " decide exactly how we are going to react to it			1
" " we are considering all possibilities , including the possibility of a court challenge , " @entity2 told reporters during questions at a news conference , at which he had announced a settlement with pharmaceutical company @entity16 over its marketing of an anti-psychotic drug			1
" i think that [ @entity5 's ] law is an unfortunate one , " he said			1
" i think that it is , i fear , subject to potential abuse			0
and i 'm very concerned about the wedge that it could draw between communities that law enforcement is supposed to serve and those of us in law enforcement			2
" homeland security secretary @entity33 , who served as @entity5 's governor until she took the position with the @entity37 administration , told a @entity39 panel tuesday that she has " deep concerns " with the law			1
@entity42 said she fears it would siphon away resources that would otherwise be used to pursue individuals who commit major crimes while in the country illegally			1
" i think these kinds of laws are not value - added to law enforcement , " she told the @entity48			2
" there 's a reason most law enforcement groups ... oppose them			2
" they put an " undue barrier " between victims of crime and law enforcement officials , she said			2
@entity42 , who served as @entity5 's governor before joining president @entity37 's @entity61 , refused to offer an opinion on the constitutionality of the law			1
the new law requires @entity5 police to determine whether people are in the @entity68 legally if there is a reason to suspect they are n't			1
@entity5 gov. @entity71 , a @entity72 , signed the controversial legislation into law friday			1
supporters say it is needed to control illegal immigration			0
the law , scheduled to go into effect 90 days after the close of the state 's legislative session , would require immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times			1
currently , officers can check someone 's immigration status only if that person is suspected in another crime			0
critics say the law could foster racial profiling and prompt businesses , conventions and tourists to stay away from the state			2
the bill has prompted rallies by opponents and supporters , and some prominent politicians in @entity0 and @entity5 have criticized the measure			1
@entity105 mayor @entity104 , a @entity106 , has said he 'll file a lawsuit to block the law			2
last week , @entity37 called the legislation " misguided " and said the federal government must act on the immigration issue			2
" our failure to act responsible at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others			2
that includes , for example , the recent efforts in @entity5 , which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as @entity68 , as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe , " he said			1
@entity42 told the @entity48 members that the " passage of laws like [ @entity5 's ] at the state level indicate the need to move forward with comprehensive immigration reform			1
" but sen. @entity133 , @entity135 - @entity134 , blamed federal authorities for undermining the push for comprehensive immigration reform by failing to more effectively secure the @entity139 border			2
" our borders are broken ... [ and ] there 's a war going on " with drug cartels in @entity139 that is spilling over into the @entity68 , he argued			0
" good people are so afraid of an out - of - control border that they had to resort to a law [ in @entity5 ] that i think is unconstitutional , " he said			1
the federal government has to prove " that we can secure our borders " before @entity149 can pass an immigration reform bill			0
over the weekend , @entity133 withdrew his support for what had been a bipartisan plan to pass climate change legislation because , he claimed , @entity155 were trying to ram through a polarizing immigration reform bill			0
some political observers have said @entity39 majority leader @entity158 , @entity159 , is trying to push a reform plan in order to boost his standing among @entity164 voters and bolster his re-election prospects in november			0
@entity167 majority leader @entity166 , @entity168 , acknowledged tuesday that congressional democrats are divided over how to proceed with an immigration reform bill			0
he also said @entity167 members are expecting the @entity39 to take the lead in crafting a proposal			0
" in part , of course , what the people of @entity5 are saying is that the feds have n't done their job			1
i think they 're right , " he said			0
but @entity166 criticized the new state law , arguing that it is " very inconsistent with past practices in @entity68			0
... we do n't go around asking people for @entity187 cards			0
" he said it is " very difficult to see how that 's going to be carried out in a way that 's consistent with the civil liberties of citizens			0
" @entity42 acknowledged that more work has to be done along the southern border , but she also expressed frustration with @entity72 arguments on border security			0
she claimed that the overall situation has improved and questioned whether the goal of " securing the border " could ever be fully reached			0
@entity42 declined to provide a direct answer when asked whether the @entity5 law could negatively impact race relations			1
but " if this law goes into effect , " she warned , " there are a lot of questions about what the real impact on the street will be			0
" @entity1 's @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
