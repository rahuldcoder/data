@entity0 , @entity1 -- residents of @entity0 in @entity1 are struggling to keep alive their centuries - old tradition of hand - dying delicate cloth a deep indigo blue , with their trade under threat from the realities of modern commerce			1
@entity0 's pits are said to date back 500 years and were once the center of a bustling @entity15 trade in dyed cloth			1
there are still over 120 pits in @entity0 but only 30 of them are functioning			1
many of them have been filled in , often because families have moved on to other businesses , but sometimes because they 're waiting for their children to grown up , dig out the pit and reclaim their tradition			2
sixty - five - year - old @entity27 has worked in the dye pits since he was a boy			1
the pits are family owned and @entity27 has trained his 21 - year - old son to continue the tradition , but such dedication is rare			1
" a lot of our elders have died , so we are calling our families to come back and embrace the work again , " said @entity27 , who is hoping his son will pass on the knowledge to another generation			2
@entity41 , potassium and ash are mixed with water in the pits , and then the cloth soaked for up to six hours			1
the longer it 's soaked , the deeper the color			0
" we are using the same ways dyers used when the pits began in 1498 , " explained @entity27			2
" we can not use modern methods because that will change our tradition			2
" methods of ironing the cloth are just as traditional ; material is beaten with a mallet to remove creases			0
but these ancient production lines are now being hammered by competition from cheaper foreign fabrics and the rising costs of energy and materials at home			0
" there have been a lot of changes			0
materials that once cost $ 10 now cost $ 40 , " said @entity27			0
despite its rich history , regional demand for the dyed wares has fallen as fashions have changed , so the dyers are looking to tourists as potential buyers			0
@entity27 hopes that with their custom the dye trade will continue , as it has for centuries , and that one day his son will be passing on the traditional techniques to his grandson .			0

@entity0 is said to be home to the oldest dye pits in @entity86 , dating back to 1498
@entity41 , potassium and ash are mixed with water to produce a deep blue dye
the tradition is under threat from cheap fabric *imports* from abroad
