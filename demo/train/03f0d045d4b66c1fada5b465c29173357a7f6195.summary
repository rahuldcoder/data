@entity0 -- ten years ago in september , rescue workers began inhaling a toxic mix of airborne debris that curled out of the @entity6 's mangle of steel , re-bar and concrete , coating in white the clothes and at times the lungs of emergency responders who worked at ground zero			1
thousands descended on @entity16 and @entity0 in 2001 in a desperate attempt to help those who had perished , or would soon die , after a series of coordinated attacks rocked the nation and redefined its security mandate			1
but news of the death of @entity24 -- @entity26 's figurehead killed during a gun battle in @entity28 -- offered @entity29 a happier reason to gasp			1
" it 's wild , " said @entity31 , wiping away his swelling tears as he held a cigarette that trembled between his fingertips			1
he was at the @entity37 celebration			0
" it 's just very intense			1
" the young veteran -- who served in @entity40 in 2004 and 2005 -- then grabbed his baseball cap , pulling it down to shield his watering eyes from view			0
" i 'm sorry , " he said			0
" i just do n't have the words			1
" @entity29 celebrated early monday in a show of patriotism against the man who committed much of his life to attacking @entity29 citizens and others			0
in front of the @entity37 , chants of " @entity29 ! @entity29 ! " filled the night air , and the group spontaneously broke into an off - key rendition of " @entity55			0
" other revelers hearkened back to the turmoil of that fateful blue - sky day in september			2
" i was in @entity0 during 9/11 , " said 33 - year - old @entity59 , recalling his days as a student at @entity61 in @entity0 from his apartment , @entity59 said he watched television images of the second hijacked plane as it plunged into the @entity6 in lower @entity66			1
" it 's hard to believe 10 years later it 's over ... it 's finally come to an end			2
" @entity71 , who recently served in @entity72 , echoed those comments , calling the news " historic			0
" @entity75 , a 29 - year - old resident of @entity0 who worked as a @entity29 contractor in @entity40 , clutched his girlfriend as they gazed across the red , white and blue crowd			1
" its one of those ' got - to - be - there ' moments , " he said			0
the mood was much more somber at the @entity85 memorial a few miles away , where 184 people died when a hijacked @entity87 crashed on september 11 , 2001			1
" everyone was at the @entity37 celebrating , and hardly anyone was at the memorial , " said @entity88 of @entity89 , @entity90			2
" i felt like this site put things in perspective			0
" meanwhile , teenagers , scarcely old enough to remember the near decade - old attacks , dashed toward the @entity37 gates , eager to join the swelling throng of @entity29 revelers			0
" it 's something that defines a generation , " said @entity101 , a @entity102 resident visiting @entity0			1
" they 're not going to pull out immediately , " she said , referring to the @entity106 - led @entity105 in @entity40			0
" there 's still a lot of work to be done , but this affirms that they were over there for a reason			2
" her comment echoes a question likely to be raised in the coming weeks and months over the ways in which an @entity29 - led war in @entity40 can continue without the specter of the @entity26 leader			0
" it 's a war that i feel we just won , " said one former @entity16 firefighter -- who says he was forced to retire due to lung ailments suffered from dust at ground zero -- the site where the @entity6 's twin towers once stood			1
private moments of reflection were happening , too , as loved ones of those killed in the september 11 attacks quietly marked @entity24 's death			1
@entity135 said she cried when president @entity136 began to describe the september 11 attacks as he delivered news of his death			2
her brother , @entity139 , was a @entity140 employee who died in the @entity6			0
in @entity16 , strains of " @entity142 " could be heard intermittently trickling through the crowd			1
the area , once a barren and bitterly contested site , has since given way to the beginnings of construction for a long awaited " @entity149 , " or the 1 @entity6			0
in another sign of the evolving times , a neighborhood @entity154 that medics once converted to a makeshift trauma center following the attacks , now houses a younger fast - food staff mostly unfamiliar with the restaurant 's storied past			2
" a lot of retired cops still come here and talk about it , " said @entity160 , a 22 year - old employee from @entity161 , @entity16			1
during the ensuing rescue effort , @entity166 treated victims atop dinning tables at the @entity170 , while draping intravenous drips across wall lamps			0
" do you want to know what i really think ? , " asked @entity160			0
" i think a lot of the people around here yelling and celebrating were just looking for an excuse to get drunk and yell			0
" " they do n't know what this is about			2
" his words seem to capture an unease with celebrating death that other @entity16 quietly reflected			1
some just seemed relieved to close the final chapter of @entity24 's life			1
@entity187 , whose mother , @entity188 , was killed on @entity189 , said she ca n't " express how this feels to my family			2
" relief is one word			0
" @entity194 , who lost his firefighter son , @entity195 , when the @entity6 's north tower collapsed , said the news offered a bit of comfort			1
" ( my ) son still is n't coming home , " he said			1
" ( there 's ) no closure , but at last , at least some justice for the murder of 3,000 @entity29 , finally			1
" elsewhere in @entity16 , police cordoned off stretches of @entity66 's @entity208 where crowds had gathered in celebrations through the night			1
september 11 has since served as a galvanizing symbol of @entity29 patriotism and its willingness to doggedly -- and at times controversially -- pursue enemies across borders			0
but it remains unclear whether decapitating @entity26 's infamous figurehead will mark a turning point in a war that has left thousands of @entity29 dead and killed untold numbers of civilians			2
in july , @entity106 offered further support for @entity40 president @entity224 's objective of taking on greater responsibility for the country 's security by 2014			2
analysts , however , remain skeptical , citing corruption and patronage networks that they say enjoy a degree of political protection			0
meanwhile , sunday 's news comes just a single day after a @entity235 announcement of a renewed offensive against allied troops and @entity40 security forces in the region			0
@entity1 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0

celebrations break out in @entity0 and @entity16 , and on college *campuses* *nationwide*
a firefighter 's father says he 's *gratified* , but @entity24 's death wo n't bring back his son
a retired @entity16 police officer says @entity24 's death gives him a sense of closure
