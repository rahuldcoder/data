@entity0 managed one more victory in death : subjecting a who 's who of the world 's dictators to the indignity of sitting through a memorial service that overflowed with praise for the principles of democracy , freedom and equality			1
it 's a pity that so many are focusing on a handshake between president @entity16 and @entity18 president @entity17			2
they are missing the much more poignant events that unfolded during tuesday 's memorial service in @entity22			0
sure , the handshake was noteworthy , maybe even meaningful			0
but any satisfaction @entity17 might have found in the gesture , any comfort authoritarian regimes might have drawn from the moment of politeness toward a dictator , dissolved in the far more powerful message of the entire event -- and of @entity16 's own resonant speech			1
you can blame @entity16 for other things , but do n't deny this was a piercing speech , a full - throated defense of democracy and freedom			1
that rainy morning in @entity38 brought no joy to tyrants			0
@entity16 paid homage to @entity0 , " @entity0 , " his tribal name , as " the last great liberator of the 20th century , " who " showed us the power of action ; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals			1
" and he reflected on the human traits that made @entity0 special			2
" i 'm not a saint , " @entity16 quoted @entity0 saying , " unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying			2
" everyone in the audience could nod , recognizing the struggle to persevere in their own lives			0
but @entity16 came not only to praise a man ; he came to shine a light on the values that made him worthy of admiration and the causes that made his struggle reverberate the world over			2
it was a moment for stony discomfort among those who traveled to @entity22 representing undemocratic , repressive regimes			0
" like @entity79 's founding fathers , " @entity16 noted , " [ @entity0 ] would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations , a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election , but by his willingness to step down from power			1
" consider who was sitting in the stadium listening to this tribute to rule of law and democracy , to handing power to an elected successor			0
it was n't just @entity17 , who along with his older brother @entity90 has ruled @entity18 for more than half a century without permitting a democratic election , while engaging , according to human rights organizations , in " repression of independent journalists , opposition leaders and human rights activists			0
" along with @entity17 in the vip stand , ostensibly honoring @entity0 's legacy , sat countless dictators and their right - hand men			1
it included the likes of @entity104 prime minister @entity103 , representing the small kingdom described by @entity106 as " a failed feudal state , " where the king uses photos of beautiful girls to attract tourists , " distracting outsiders from @entity104 's shocking realities of oppression , abject poverty , hunger and disease			0
" @entity106 says that in the past 40 years , " two despots have used @entity104 for their personal purposes while ignoring the needs of the @entity122 people and their legitimate rights to have a say over how they are governed and how the country 's resources are used " -- the very antithesis of @entity0 's struggle			1
@entity0 was , indeed , human and flawed			2
but there were aspects of his life that seemed superhuman			0
among them was his ability to forgive his former enemies			0
that was a part of @entity16 's message that should have made some of the visiting vips cower in shame			1
@entity16 quoted @entity0 's words during his 1964 trial , when he said , " i have fought against white domination , and i have fought against black domination			1
" citing those particular words was like unleashing daggers against the likes of @entity147 , president of @entity148 since 1987 , who sat in the audience along with scores of celebrities and foreign dignitaries			0
like @entity0 , @entity147 led his country to victory over white rule			0
but unlike his neighbor , @entity147 grasped for power without letting go , and engaged in a vindictive campaign against white @entity148 that wrought misery for blacks and whites			0
in his speech , @entity16 did n't leave his audience to unpack the condemnation of the hypocrites that he brought thinly wrapped in praise for @entity0			1
he unpacked it all himself and placed it in the center of the arena : " there are too many leaders who claim solidarity with @entity0 's struggle for freedom but do not tolerate dissent from their own people , " a truth as piercing as the blaring vuvuzelas from @entity22 celebrating the life of their beloved hero			1
you could list the men , the countries , the regimes , that should have felt directly attacked by @entity16 's words in a crowd that included envoys from @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and many other states whose leaders are not popularly elected and the many others guilty of repression and human rights violations			1
@entity16 called out the hypocrisy , although the truth is that it was inescapable in many of the comments that followed news of @entity0 's death			1
if we had a prize for the most brazen display of duplicity following @entity0 's passing , we would have fierce competition but one indisputable winner			1
that would be the @entity215 dictator , president @entity214 , whose statement of condolence was posted on the @entity220 's @entity219 page , calling @entity0 " an inspiration to the all the vulnerable peoples of the world , in the expectation that oppressors and aggressors will learn ... " the statement elicited bitter laughter around the world			2
@entity0 was not perfect , but there is a reason why his life inspired billions of people and his death brought what might have been the largest gathering of world leaders in modern history			2
he stood for values and principles that have gained universal legitimacy			0
those include the right to fair and equal treatment for all and the right of all people to choose their own government			0
the way @entity0 lived his life was a call to forgiveness and reconciliation			2
it was @entity255 @entity254 ban ki - moon who called @entity0 " one of our greatest teachers			0
" like all the best teachers , @entity0 managed one more lesson during his memorial service , and it was @entity16 , the professor , the man whose own career might not have reached the pinnacle , who served as @entity0 's principal assistant that day , imparting a much - needed lesson for despots .			1

@entity272 : @entity0 's death resulted in a moment of truth for dictators , oppressors
they had to sit through an event that celebrated democracy and equality , she writes
@entity16 's speech clearly rebuked dictators who defy the will of their people , @entity284 says
@entity284 : @entity0 was a great teacher who *emphasized* reconciliation
