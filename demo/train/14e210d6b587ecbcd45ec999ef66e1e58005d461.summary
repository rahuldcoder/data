-- in november 2011 , the @entity1 had a panel on " cyberetiquette			1
" we met in a theater at @entity1 headquarters			1
on the stage was a moderator , a @entity1 reporter , and two of the @entity1 's regular " advice and manners " columnists			1
and then there was me , there , i suppose to represent the cyberworld and where it might take us			1
as i remember it , we responded to questions from the moderator and from the floor with general agreement on most matters : no texting at family dinner			2
do n't bring your laptop to your children 's sporting events , no matter how tempting			2
( your daughter looks up from her star turn at lacrosse , and you are deep into an e-mail to your supervisor			2
the game was boring until then , sure			2
but e-mail can get so engrossing that you 've got to be careful ; you 're playing with fire ! ) then came this question from the floor : a woman said that as a working mother she had very little time to talk to her friends , to e-mail , to text , to keep up			2
" actually , " she confessed , " the only time i have is at night , after i 'm off work and before i go home , when i go family shopping at @entity48 's [ a supermarket ]			2
but the guy at the checkout line , he wants to talk			2
i just want to be on my phone , into my texts and @entity55			2
do i have the right to just ignore him ? " watch @entity59 's @entity58 the two manners experts went first			1
each said a version of the same thing : the man who did the checkout had a job to do			2
she had a right to her privacy as he provided his service			0
i thought of growing up and all the years i went shopping with my grandmother , all the relationships she had with the tradespeople at every store : the baker , the fishmonger , the fruit man , the grocery man , for this is how we called them			0
@entity58 : make data more human if they had n't spoken to us , we would have been upset			1
if we had n't spoken to them , i always assumed they would have been upset as well			0
i was not older than my fellow panelists			0
and i 've never considered myself a nostalgic person			0
but i found myself disagreeing with them			0
i answered the question from the floor in a very different spirit			0
i said that we all know that the job that the man at the checkout counter was doing can now be done by a machine			0
but until he is replaced by a machine , i think he should be treated as a person , with all the rights of a person			0
and that includes a bit of human exchange , since that is clearly what makes his job tolerable for him , makes him feel that in his job , this job that could be done by a machine , he is still a human being			1
@entity58 : we are all cyborgs now my fellow panelists were not pushovers			0
this was not what they wanted to hear			0
but in this moment , as in so many others like it , when i took stock of their unhappy reaction to what i said , i felt myself at the cold , hard center of a perfect storm : we expect more from technology and less from each other			1
what once would have seemed like " good service " is now an inconvenience			0
that 's the " less from each other " part of the equation			0
we also want technology to step in as we invite people to step back			1
it used to be that we imagined that our mobile phones would be for us to talk to each other			0
now , our mobile phones are there to talk to us			0
new commercials for @entity141 , the digital assistant on @entity143 's @entity142 , have it serving as a best friend and confidante to a man who is preparing for a romantic dinner date at home and to an @entity151 © nue who takes a rainy day off from work to dance around her apartment in bare feet			1
i interview young people who tell me they hope that in the future , @entity141 will be even more like a best friend to them			1
@entity58 : how technology evolves we are at a moment of temptation , ready to turn to machines for companionship even as we seem pained or inconvenienced to engage with each other in settings as simple as a grocery store			1
we want to instrumentalize daily life with real people and accept fantasies of " intimate " conversations with robotic personal assistants who have no real understanding of what we are saying to them in terms of what things mean to us			1
we seem lonely but afraid of intimacy			0
@entity141 , the social network , digital assistants , all of these give the illusion of companionship without the demands of relationship			1
the path we are on seems fraught with paradox and about the most important human matters			1
yet smitten with technology , we are like young lovers who are afraid that too much talking will spoil the romance			1
we do n't much want to talk about these problems			0
but it 's time to talk			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity59 .			1

@entity59 , once an *enthusiast* for digital technology , expresses some doubts
she says people are so focused on *devices* , networks , that other things get ignored
@entity59 : in our rush to *connect* online , are we leaving behind real human *interaction* ?
we want technology to step in as we invite people to step back , she says
