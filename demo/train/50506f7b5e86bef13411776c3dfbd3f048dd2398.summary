@entity0 -- at the outset , this new coalition of the willing seemed like a coalition of the iffy			0
as secretary of state @entity7 wrapped up his @entity9 tour to rally @entity11 support for the fight against @entity13 earlier this month , he returned with pledges from more than 40 @entity11 countries , but few concrete commitments			2
now , five @entity11 states -- all @entity18 - led -- have joined the @entity19 in striking the militant @entity21 group inside @entity22 in a show of force that is bolstering the coalition 's credibility			1
the @entity19 confirmed that @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , the @entity30 and @entity31 participated in the action but left it up to those states to divulge the details of their involvement			0
the coalition that struck @entity22 for the first time in this conflict was notably , and intentionally , devoid of @entity42 partners to give the efforts an @entity11 face -- a departure from past @entity19 interventions in the region			1
and while several @entity50 nations have supplied the @entity22 opposition and @entity28 has quietly hosted a @entity53 training program for @entity22 rebels on its soil for at least a year , the strikes mark the most overt and significant involvement in the @entity22 conflict			0
as president @entity61 and @entity19 officials have emphasized : every @entity11 nation has a stake in thwarting @entity13 -- and it appears those countries are catching on to that realization , sending a strong message that @entity13 is just as much a threat to @entity18 in the region as to @entity69 - dominant @entity68 and the western world			1
" the strength of this coalition makes it clear to the world that this is not @entity19 's fight alone , " @entity61 said			1
" above all , the people and governments of the @entity9 are rejecting @entity78 and standing up for the peace and security that the people of the region and the world deserve			0
" the action finally gives credence to @entity88 officials ' claims over the last few weeks that the @entity19 has accumulated concrete commitments from @entity11 nations to thwart the advance of @entity13			1
" last night 's strikes were only the beginning , " @entity93 spokesman rear adm. @entity92 said			0
and with @entity19 officials predicting a long - term campaign to " defeat , and ultimately degrade " @entity13 , as @entity61 has put it , it is still unclear whether @entity11 nations are committed to a drawn - out effort			1
how @entity61 came to launch strikes in @entity22 the coalition the @entity30 , which has been one of the @entity19 ' strongest partners in the fight against @entity13 , confirmed its participation in the " international effort against the @entity78 , " another acronym for @entity13			1
and in its statement , the @entity30 foreign ministry left the door open to further military strikes , noting that its air force " launched its first strikes against @entity78			0
" @entity29 and @entity28 also confirmed that their air forces struck terrorist targets inside @entity22 , with @entity28 also saying it would strike again if fighting spills over into @entity28 , as it has in recent months			2
@entity27 's official press agency confirmed the country 's role in " military operations in @entity22			2
" @entity31 has yet to put out a statement on its role in the strikes , but a senior @entity19 military official has told @entity1 's @entity128 that @entity31 did not drop bombs in @entity22			1
even if acting only in a support role , its public involvement in the military campaign is a symbolic move that could have big implications			0
the @entity50 nation has been increasingly ostracized by its @entity50 neighbors over the last six months for its support of the @entity139 and over accusations that it is playing both sides of the @entity22 conflict			0
the @entity19 has increasingly pressured @entity31 to clamp down on @entity31 who are reportedly financing @entity13			2
@entity19 - led airstrikes in @entity22 : who 's in , who 's not @entity148 , @entity150 decline aid for @entity152 effort secretary of state @entity7 continued to emphasize as recently as friday 's @entity154 meeting that " there is a role for nearly every country in the world to play " in the fight against @entity13			1
but some nations were notably off the list of countries involved in the military campaign against @entity13 monday night			2
@entity148 , a @entity165 ally , and @entity150 were both on the sidelines as the @entity19 - led coalition pummeled targets inside @entity22			1
while the two countries are part of the 40 - member group of nations supporting the take - down of @entity13 , the two countries have shied from making any actionable commitments			0
until now , @entity148 has pinned its restraint on a group of 49 @entity148 hostages held by @entity13			0
and now that @entity148 has managed to secure those hostages release , @entity19 and @entity165 officials have raised concerns that @entity148 may have bartered its involvement for the hostages ' freedom			0
@entity148 prime minister @entity186 told reporters in front of the @entity189 on tuesday that @entity148 will do what it can to help the fight against @entity13 and called the strikes " positive			2
" @entity7 and @entity61 have emphasized , though , that the fight against @entity13 is not a purely military effort and the @entity61 administration has been seeking out commitments from @entity11 states to cut off @entity13 's financial pipeline and track the stem and flow of foreign fighters -- now numbered at about 10,000 -- now fighting for @entity13 and other extremist groups inside @entity68 and @entity22			1
the @entity19 has also sought out support from @entity139 clerics in the region to denounce @entity13 's claim to the mantle of @entity207 in the region			1
growing fear of extremism and increasing fears in the region have pushed @entity11 states to join the @entity19 effort			0
@entity13 's rise is not an outlier in a region that has seen terrorist and extremist groups burgeon in the aftermath of the @entity11 spring -- from insurgents in @entity220 to terrorist groups staking their claim in @entity150 's @entity223			2
so as the @entity19 has played up regional fears about the growth of @entity13 , partner @entity11 nations are now calling on the @entity19 to help address the swell of extremism in the region , @entity11 diplomats tell @entity1			1
and further @entity11 involvement could be contingent on a broader @entity19 commitment to stamping out extremist ideology threatening current governments throughout the @entity9			0
with up to 10,000 foreigners -- most of them coming from the @entity9 and @entity238 -- fighting with @entity13 in @entity68 and @entity22 , @entity11 rulers are starting to fear how the return of those extremist fighters could threaten their countries ' stability			2
@entity28 , for example , which borders both @entity68 and @entity22 , is already feeling the effects of a humanitarian crisis that has spilled onto its territory , where more than 600,000 @entity22 refugees are testing the capacity of the @entity28 state			0
and @entity11 fears in the region have helped the @entity19 drum up a global coalition that can defeat @entity13 -- both its forces and its ideology			1
" we can not destroy this group on our own , " @entity7 said in a recent interview with @entity1			0
" defeating this common enemy calls for a common cause , and we 're taking it on to succeed together			0
" maps : @entity11 nations join @entity19 , expand fight against terror to @entity22 @entity1 's @entity128 contributed to this report .			1

the coalition that struck @entity13 in @entity22 was notably devoid of @entity42 partners
that was a departure from past @entity19 interventions in the region
