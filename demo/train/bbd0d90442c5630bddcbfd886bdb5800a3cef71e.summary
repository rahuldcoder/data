@entity0 -- from his @entity0 hospital room , journalist @entity2 recalled sunday his harrowing journey to hell and back from @entity6 -- speaking out against what he called its " murderous regime " in tribute to those , including his colleague @entity9 , killed in the chaos			1
few foreign journalists have been in the @entity16 nation in recent months , as @entity6 's government has stringently restricted access amid widespread violence that the @entity20 estimates has left more than 7,500 people dead			1
president @entity23 's government blames " armed terrorist groups " for the bloodshed			2
yet senior @entity20 official @entity26 told the @entity27 last week that often over " 100 civilians a day , including women and children " are being killed -- most of them the victims of what activists and witnesses have described as brutal attacks by @entity6 government forces			1
@entity2 spoke to @entity1 at length , days after surviving a bloody attack and surreptitiously escaping from the ravaged city of @entity40 to @entity41 and eventually back to his native @entity42			1
after spending several days in @entity6 , both reporting and lying wounded in an embattled medical center , he had no doubts about who was responsible			1
" it 's really hard when you 've got people presenting you with bits of people saying , ' why are n't you helping ? ' what can i tell them ? " @entity2 said			1
" it 's not like we do n't know what 's happening anymore			2
" his colleague at @entity42 's @entity59 ' newspaper , @entity60 , had been with him earlier in february when they sneaked into @entity40 , which has been a hub of the resistance movement and government crackdown			1
@entity2 called the experience -- without government minders , into what had been a largely imagined situation until then -- " an eye - opener ( given ) the level of butchery going on			1
" after what they 'd seen already , @entity60 could n't stand to just head home , he said			0
" @entity9 was on fire , " @entity2 said			1
" she could n't let this go			0
two days was n't enough			0
" so they returned to @entity40 to find " the situation was going downhill , almost by the hour			1
" they talked with @entity1 and the @entity80 , intent on doing whatever possible to get the news out			0
around 8:15 a.m. the next morning , february 22 , the building they were in took a direct hit , filling the air with dust and smoke			0
@entity2 remembered feeling " massive pressure " and knowing he 'd been hit			1
he later was found to be severely wounded in his stomach and leg			0
" so i ran through where the door had been and , on the way out , more or less tripped over @entity9 's body and fell down next to her , " he said			1
" her head was covered in rubble , her legs were covered in rubble , and she was obviously dead			0
" activists soon risked their lives and dragged @entity2 outside , threw him in a car and took him to the field hospital -- " ironically , what we 'd been trying to get to for two days			1
" a room , fitted with mattresses , became home to @entity2 and another wounded journalist , @entity108 of @entity109 , for the next five days			1
he learned that , in addition to @entity60 , another journalist , @entity110 , also was killed , while colleague @entity112 had survived the attack			1
yet there was little peace			0
every day , there was " the most savage and ferocious bombardment " imaginable -- reporting even what he called an " @entity120 drone flying around , looking for targets			2
" then late one afternoon , ambulances descended on the hospital			0
the initial word was first that there was a cease - fire and that @entity129 representatives would be on hand soon to take him , @entity108 and others home			0
but @entity2 said @entity129 workers did n't show up , just civilian @entity129 members " with no diplomatic presence			1
" a delegation member who was trusted by the @entity138 -- the armed opposition group , made up largely of @entity6 military defectors , who had looked after the journalists -- said that he heard @entity6 state television planned to film the two being put on ambulances , then government forces would stage an attack that they 'd later blame on the @entity138			1
@entity2 said he was confused , but determined to get out			1
" when you see bodies of kids with sniper rounds through the head , what 's a journalist who had two of their roommates killed ( to think ) ? " he said			2
" i 'd rather die on the ground than wait for some lunatic to come in and start ( shooting )			0
" a short time later , after borrowing shoes and pants , @entity2 said he got an injection from doctors -- " i just said put anything in , because i knew it was going to be a very painful experience " -- and got into a @entity138 vehicle			1
he emerged on a street , then found " most of the buildings " that had been there a few days before were " gone			0
" @entity2 said a rope was tied around him , and he was lowered about five meters ( 16 feet ) into a tunnel			2
there , he and a seriously wounded boy , roughly 10 years old , joined a driver on a small motorbike			0
" we just drove off , into this night , in this tunnel , " he said , adding that he learned @entity6 forces shot up the same tunnel some 20 minutes later			2
yet he got out safely on the other end , being put on a stretcher and then placed in a " van full of dead and sick guys			0
" the rest of his voyage consisted of " a series of motorbike rides ( and ) car journeys , " at times past sporadic attacks and through battlefields			2
finally , @entity2 said he was dropped off at a house , where three men were sitting watching television , with their machine guns nearby			2
" and i thought , well , i better ask : are we in @entity6 or @entity41 ? they went , ' @entity41 , ' " he said			2
" i just kind of sat down and had a toke of a ... cigarette ... " that 's the first time that i felt i could actually allow myself to celebrate			0
but i could n't be delighted because nobody else was there with me			0
i was on my own			0
" soon he was in the home of @entity202 , @entity42 's ambassador to @entity41 , and eventually back in his native @entity203			0
last friday , both @entity108 and @entity112 returned to @entity109 -- with the opposition group @entity204 claiming it helped them escape			0
now , dressed in a hospital gown , @entity2 is on another mission : to get the word out about what 's really going on			2
that is the best way , he figures , to reflect the spirit and mission of @entity60 and other journalists killed in @entity6			1
and he would return , he says , if only to challenge the @entity6 government to an open debate about what they have done and what they 'll do next			2
@entity2 said he 's convinced " this regime will continue to exterminate civilians			1
" " if you are big enough to throw your army in to kill the women and children , then be big enough to have a conversation about it , " he said			0
" if you 've got nothing to hide , come and do it			0
" i 'd go back , absolutely			0

@entity2 was hurt while surreptitously reporting from @entity40 , @entity6
his @entity59 ' colleague , @entity9 , was killed in the same attack
he fled @entity6 on motorbikes , vans and cars through tunnels and battlefields
" this regime will continue to exterminate civilians , " he says
