@entity0 -- the @entity3 has launched an investigation into @entity6 's @entity5 after a report that employees or associates may have attempted to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of september 11 survivors , victims and their families , a federal law enforcement source told @entity1 thursday			1
" we are aware of the allegations and are looking into them , " said the source , who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the investigation			2
" we 'll be looking at anyone acting for or on behalf of @entity5 , from the top down to janitors , " to gather information and determine whether any laws may have been broken			1
because the investigation just began , it 's too early to say when the first interviews will be conducted , the source said , adding the probe is a " high priority			0
" @entity34 rep. @entity33 , a @entity35 , earlier this week asked fbi director @entity36 to investigate the possibility that journalists working for @entity6 may have tapped into the phones of 9/11 victims and relatives			1
@entity5 said thursday it had no comment on the @entity3 investigation or the possibility of congressional hearings			1
meanwhile , @entity5 boss @entity6 said in an interview late thursday with the @entity48 newspaper -- one of @entity5 's own publications -- that he felt the company had handled the crisis " extremely well in every way possible			1
" he told the newspaper he had decided to appear before @entity56 politicians next tuesday , after initially declining to attend the hearing , because he wanted to address " some of the things that have been said in @entity59 , some of which are total lies			1
we think it 's important to absolutely establish our integrity in the eyes of the public ... i felt it 's best just to be as transparent as possible			0
" concerns over the hacking of phones belonging to 9/11 victims and relatives appear to be traceable to a story published wednesday by the @entity74 , a @entity56 tabloid that includes a section it describes as " gossip gone toxic			1
" the newspaper cited " a source " who referred to a former police officer who now works as a private investigator			0
" the investigator is used by a lot of journalists in @entity87 and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims ' private phone data , " the source reportedly told the newspaper			2
the source told the @entity74 the request came from @entity92 , the newspaper at the center of the phone - hacking scandal in @entity56			2
" he said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their relatives , " the newspaper said			0
" his presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the relevant voice mails , just like has been shown they have done in the @entity56			1
the @entity108 said he had to turn the job down			0
he knew how insensitive such research would be , and how bad it would look			0
" the investigator said the journalists seemed particularly interested in getting the phone records belonging to the @entity56 victims of the attacks			2
" relatives of the victims of the terrorist attacks expressed outrage over the possibility they may have been hacking victims			0
what they went through is " heartfelt stuff , and it should n't be out there for all to see unless the family approves , " said @entity128 , a retired @entity129 deputy chief who lost a son in the attacks			0
" until we get some accountability , they 're just going to keep doing it , " @entity128 said			0
" it 's completely unethical , unprofessional and basically criminal			0
" @entity137 , who also lost a son in the attacks , called it " very horrifying that privacy and personal security could be violated in such an egregious manner			0
" " i would hold these people accountable and responsible , " she told @entity1 thursday			0
" someone has to defend the dead			0
" @entity148 sen. @entity147 of @entity149 said the september 11 families have " suffered enough " and deserve answers			1
pressure mounted for a federal investigation into @entity6 's media empire as a key member of a @entity157 oversight committee called for @entity158 to look into the allegation that one of his @entity87 - based companies may have broken anti-bribery and other laws			1
rep. @entity165 , @entity166 , told @entity1 that " @entity158 has important oversight responsibilities " in responding to the charges and " getting to the bottom of this evolving scandal			0
" " my number one priority is to protect @entity87 citizens from violation of the law , " he said			2
@entity92 , a 168 - year - old @entity56 newspaper owned by @entity6 , folded over the weekend in the wake of accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims , politicians and celebrities			1
police in the @entity56 have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking			2
there also were allegations that reporters may have bribed law enforcement officers			0
on wednesday , several senators sent letters to attorney general @entity192 asking him to look into concerns that @entity5 violated the @entity194			1
the law , enacted in 1977 , makes it illegal for a @entity87 person or company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business			1
potential liability flows from journalists at @entity92 to its parent , @entity204 , and to its parent , @entity5 , which is a publicly held company in the @entity87			1
@entity6 's @entity5 -- the parent company of @entity206 -- may have engaged in " political espionage or personal espionage , " @entity165 said			1
sen. @entity209 , @entity210 , told @entity1 earlier this week he may start his own investigation			0
" my bet is we 'll find some criminal stuff , " @entity209 said			0
" this is going to be a huge issue			0
" in an interview published thursday by the @entity48 , which is owned by @entity5 , @entity6 said the company would establish its own independent committee " to investigate every charge of improper conduct			1
" @entity6 said the committee , to be led by a " distinguished non-employee , " also will draw up a " protocol for behavior " for the company 's new reporters			2
sen. @entity228 , @entity229 , told " @entity236 " that he wrote a letter to @entity56 prime minister @entity231 , asking that the @entity56 government share information from its investigation about any possible phone tapping of @entity87 citizens			1
@entity1 's @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 contributed to this report .			2
