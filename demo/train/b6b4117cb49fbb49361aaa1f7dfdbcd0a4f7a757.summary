@entity0 , @entity1 -- in radio broadcasts and sermons , @entity4 militants have been promoting themselves as @entity8 @entity7 , defending @entity1 's rural poor from a ruling elite that they describe as corrupt and oppressive			1
@entity11 , with his son @entity12 , is among those who have embraced the @entity4 's message			1
that message has been resonating throughout the @entity1 countryside , where the culture is deeply conservative and the people are desperately poor			2
in farmlands just 15 miles ( 24 kilometers ) from the center of @entity0 , @entity11 and his 15 - year - old son @entity12 eke out a living by cutting grass for their four water buffalo			1
they feed their family of seven , earning the equivalent of around $ 50 a month by selling buffalo milk			0
two months ago , @entity11 said , the government bulldozed his family 's house , probably because they were illegally squatting on property they did not own			2
" justice [ in @entity1 ] is only for people who have money , " @entity11 said , while slicing through handfuls of grass with a small scythe			2
" we are illiterate , " he added , " but we are hoping that with @entity8 sharia law , our lives will get better			0
" across this overwhelmingly @entity8 country , there is widespread hope that adopting a strict code of law based on the @entity48 will transform a society where corruption is rampant and where at least a quarter of the population lives under the poverty line			0
watch why the @entity4 's message would resonate enforcement of sharia law is the platform the @entity4 have been using to justify recent land - grabs , such as last week 's armed occupation of the district of @entity61 , some 60 miles from the @entity1 capital			1
in an interview with @entity2 , @entity63 , the @entity4 spokesman in the militant stronghold of @entity65 , denounced the @entity1 government , calling the prime minister and lawmakers " un-islamic			1
" " they 're making money like in a supermarket , " @entity63 said , adding that under sharia law both the rich and the poor would be treated equally			0
militants have slowly taken over territory in northwestern @entity1 by first targeting unpopular landlords and bureaucrats , according to @entity78 , the human rights watchdog			1
the @entity4 move into an area , they use local existing resentments			2
they often go in with the guise of being @entity7 , " said @entity78 representative @entity84			2
" they scare away some local thieves , they impose very , very quick justice , very harsh justice , and initially in some places they are even welcomed			0
" the @entity4 's promise of @entity8 justice would be welcomed in farm fields on the outskirts of @entity0			1
rows of wheat -- along with the posh villas of @entity1 's ruling elite -- are within sight of @entity0 's iconic white @entity102			1
" in the present judicial system , even the innocent people are punished , " said @entity103 , as he and a group of farmers shared lunch under the shade of a tree			0
the group explained that they were losing a court battle to stop the government from seizing their land , because they claimed they could n't afford to bribe policemen and judges			0
" every part of the country should have sharia law , like in @entity122 , " said @entity103 's brother @entity117 , who sported a long bushy beard			0
" then poor and rich people will be equal			0
" " we love the @entity4 , " announced one @entity125 farmer who asked not to be named			2
he called the militants heroes			0
sports star - turned - politician @entity127 summed up his response to the @entity4 in @entity1 by saying , " the poorer section of society is joining them ... this is now developing into a battle between the ' haves ' and the ' have - nots			1
' " what the @entity4 are giving them is cheap -- in fact , free -- accessible justice at the village level , " he added			2
" this is what @entity1 should be doing for its own people			0
" but if farmer @entity144 has his way , @entity4 justice would mean taking away freedoms from @entity1 women , like the right to have a driver 's license			1
" women should not even come out of their houses			0
that 's against @entity8 " he said , while complaining about the un-islamic fashions he saw women wearing in @entity0			1
when @entity4 militants overran @entity61 last week , they told women to stay indoors , warned men to stop shaving their beards , and threatened shopkeepers who sold movies and music			0
in @entity1 's rural society , male strangers are not even supposed look at local women			1
and yet , some farmers enjoy blaring @entity172 music and even dancing on trailers full of hay , while driving their gaudily - decorated tractors			0
if the @entity4 's rural revolt succeeds , it could bring silence to the @entity1 countryside .			1

@entity78 : @entity4 first targets unpopular landlords , bureaucrats
@entity4 spokesman in @entity65 calls @entity1 government as " un-islamic "
