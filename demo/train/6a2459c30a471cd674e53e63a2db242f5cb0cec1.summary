@entity0 , @entity1 -- a gunman in apparent financial distress took several firefighters hostage wednesday in suburban @entity6 , then was killed in an exchange of gunfire hours later after law enforcement authorities determined he might lash out at his captives			1
" it got to the point where we believed that ( the firefighters ' ) lives were in immediate danger , " @entity13 police spokesman @entity11 said wednesday night			1
" and our swat team made the decision to go in there and neutralize the situation			0
" all four @entity13 firefighters who were being held hostage suffered " superficial " injuries after authorities used explosives " to distract the suspect to get in the house and take care of business , " @entity24 explained			1
their injuries were the result of the explosions , not gunfire , and all four were expected to go home by night 's end			1
one law enforcement officer was shot in the incident , but his injury is not considered life - threatening , according to @entity24			1
all those involved in the incident -- including the @entity13 police officer -- were in good condition as they were treated at @entity49 , hospital spokeswoman @entity43 said			1
several have been released , she said			2
" they are simply relieved that the situation is over , " said @entity52 spokesman @entity51			0
" the firefighters are glad to be getting treated ... and really work on getting their lives back to normal			1
" the hostage situation began around 3:40 p.m. wednesday when the firefighters went to a residence in @entity0 " for some type of medical call , " @entity24 said			1
four hours later , he noted authorities still were n't sure whether that call was for a " fake heart attack " or the gunman was actually suffering from a medical condition			1
one fire engine and an ambulance were sent to the scene , as is customary , @entity51 said			0
he explained that the firefighters involved are cross-trained as paramedics so they can provide aid to county residents in purported medical emergencies like this , which happen " hundreds of times throughout the year			1
" " this is what they do , it 's what they do very well , " said @entity51 , saying the firefighters had no reason to think this situation would turn violent			2
" this call seemed to be no different ... they were caught off guard			2
" five firefighters had gone inside the home -- a two - story structure , one of many in the neighborhood about 30 miles northeast of @entity6 -- with a stretcher , then a single firefighter ran out about 30 minutes later , according to neighbors			1
@entity51 said one firefighter was let go so he could move the fire truck from in front of the house			0
the house was foreclosed upon in november and was being prepared for sale , said @entity103 , a spokesman for @entity104 it was not clear what , if anything , that fact had to do with what unfolded wednesday			0
@entity110 , an 18 - year - old neighbor who used to mow the alleged hostage taker 's lawn , said he seemed " really nice , ... like a normal guy			1
" his yard , though , " was a mess ( and ) inside it was just as bad , " @entity110 said			2
@entity24 , the police spokesman , said that the unidentified gunman started making demands related to the house after taking the firefighters hostage			1
" the power was turned off along with the cable and cell phone and so on , and he wanted all those things turned back on , " said @entity24 , adding that " apparently he was going through some financial issues			1
" hostage negotiators were on site , as were agents from the federal @entity132 , according to @entity133 , a spokesman for that agency			2
as scores of law enforcement officers converged on the site , @entity110 said his only hope was that everything he was hearing about the situation " was wrong			0
" " i knew that ( once ) it had escalated to this level , ... it was n't going to end well , " said @entity110 , who lives about a block away			0
" whatever happened , it was n't going to end well			0
" explosions rang out around 7:30 p.m. , and soon after ambulances rushed away from the scene			0
" thirty seconds later , i knew everything was ok , " said @entity149 , who lived two doors down , of the sequence of big and small explosions , followed by a flurry of gunfire			0
" because the ( firefighters ) walked out , they took their hard hats off			2
" @entity24 explained later that there had been an exchange of " gunfire between officers and that individual			0
" " this was his call , his decision , this was the result of his actions , " the police spokesman said			2
" we did n't want it this way			0
but he was calling the shots			0
