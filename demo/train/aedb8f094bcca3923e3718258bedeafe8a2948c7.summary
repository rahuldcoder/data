-- the month in which babies are born can affect how their immune systems develop , and even how vulnerable they are to autoimmune diseases			1
scientists studying the neurological disorder multiple sclerosis , in which the body 's own immune cells destroy the protective coating around nerves and can lead to paralysis and loss of other functions , have long been puzzled by the " birth month effect			1
" many patients with @entity17 are born in the spring , and rates of the disease are lowest for those born in november			2
some have speculated that insufficient levels of vitamin d , which the skin produces when exposed to sunlight , on the mom 's part could play a role , since babies born in may are gestated during the colder , darker months , while winter babies are in utero during the spring and summer			1
now a study published in @entity34 shows that this hunch may be correct , and suggests a mechanism for how the vitamin might be driving immune system development			1
@entity0 : @entity39 not recommended post-menopause researchers in the @entity42 studied 50 babies born in @entity44 in may and 50 babies born in november between 2009 and 2010			2
they sampled blood from the newborns ' umbilical chords and recorded levels of vitamin d and a specific type of immune cell known as autoreactive t - cells			2
t - cells are the white blood cells that battle pathogens like bacteria and viruses , but autoreactive t - cells are aberrant versions that mistake the body 's own cells as foreign and attack them as they would an unwanted infection			0
@entity0 : @entity17 drug may not slow disease the researchers found that babies born in may had vitamin d levels that were 20 % lower than those in babies born in november , and almost double the amount of autoreactive t - cells			0
they speculate that vitamin d may be important in some way in educating t cells about how to recognize self cells ; this occurs in the thymus , and errors in the training could lead to higher levels of the destructive t cells			0
the connection between vitamin d and immune disorders first emerged from population studies that showed people who lived further away from the equator , in places with less sunlight , were at higher risk of developing @entity17 but the researchers caution that their results still do n't suggest that lower levels of the vitamin cause autoimmune disorders like @entity17 so it 's not clear yet whether supplements of vitamin d could help to lower rates of the disease â € ” especially for those conceived in july and born in may			1
in fact , experts continue to debate how much vitamin d is appropriate for otherwise healthy people when it comes to preventing disease , since studies on the subject are conflicting			0
the @entity110 currently recommends that adults get about 600 @entity112 daily			0
@entity0 : after @entity114 's @entity17 diagnosis more research is needed to figure out whether pregnant women might need to take more vitamin d in order to strengthen their babies ' immune systems , but doctors now have a better understanding of what birth months have to do with how the immune system develops			1
