-- arriving in @entity2 at the age of 19 to study music , @entity1 knew he wanted to do big things			1
now , little more than a decade later , the young @entity7 classical composer is riding high with a chart - topping album featuring 38 @entity10 - winning musicians			1
" i left @entity7 with the hope of maybe one day creating music that can connect with the entire world , music that can show another dimension of my culture , and my history , " @entity1 says			1
" i came to @entity2 with the hopes of integrating two cultures , and creating a new product that is no longer eastern or @entity20			0
" it appears he is well on his way to accomplishing that goal			0
@entity1 's debut album , " @entity26 : the @entity31 , " hit number one twice on @entity29 's classical chart -- a first for an @entity7 musician			1
" to be number one , this means the world is now listening , " @entity1 says			2
" it is an amazing honor for me , but i feel like it 's not about me alone			0
the success is for @entity7 , not for me			2
" growing up in @entity7 , @entity1 says he was fortunate enough to be part of a family with strong musical roots			1
" i had the opportunity to grow up in a house which was sort of the center for all the great musicians , poets and philosophers , and musical instruments were my toys , " he says			0
@entity1 's father @entity51 , who also performs on the album with his son , is one of @entity7 's most beloved and famous classical singers , and @entity1 says , one of his greatest teachers			1
" my father , the tone of his voice , the style of his singing is unique			0
he broke a lot of @entity65 classical singing rules and he created his own style by incorporating @entity68 's poetry in @entity65 classical music for the first time 40 years ago			1
" @entity68 , is @entity68 , the 13th century @entity70 , poet and philosopher , whose works have been translated into many of the world 's languages and whose influence has transcended ethnic and geographical boundaries			2
much of @entity68 's poetry focuses on love -- more specifically love for the @entity80			1
and for @entity1 , like his father before him , that love finds a perfect home in musical expression			2
" i think music is the sound of @entity87 , the sound of the universe for me			0
music also has the power to go inside the heart			0
if you really hear music , " says @entity1			2
" no matter what it is , if it touches you , you will love it , no matter what background you are from , or what religion you practice			0
" " one of my ultimate goals , " he says , " is to make sure that one day @entity68 is as popular as @entity100			0
" and his album is merely the beginning , @entity1 says			2
following in his father 's footsteps , he brings not only the essence of @entity65 culture -- but also @entity68 's message to an even wider audience than ever before			1
" i want to create a revolution with music , " the young musician says , " with love rather than hate , or chaos and bloodshed			1
" " there is another more powerful force in this universe , " he continues , " and that force is love , and it 's music			0
and i would love for that message to be the sound of us in this modern time			0
