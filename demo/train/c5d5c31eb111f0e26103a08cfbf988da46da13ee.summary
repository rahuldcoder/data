-- these are the days of uncertainty			1
the pollsters tell us so			0
you would n't know it from the pundits , however			0
they rend their garments or sing hosannas as if each little survey statistic was handed down from on high , chiseled into tablets			0
" is @entity18 panicking ? " asked a @entity14 headline in mid-september after polls indicated president @entity16 had received a post-convention bounce			1
" did @entity16 just throw the entire election away ? " an alarmed @entity19 asked after the first presidential debate , reeling off a flurry of the president 's poor polling numbers			1
the fact is , every day is a day of uncertainty -- and we hate that			1
psychologically , it gives us comfort to determine our fates , says dr. @entity32 , a @entity33 - based psychiatrist and expert on personality dynamics			1
" we 're sort of hardwired to predict what is going to happen to protect ourselves , " he says			1
after all , for much of mankind 's recorded history , a prediction could literally mean the difference between life and death -- whether it was determining a village 's vulnerability to attack or attempting to figure out the size of the coming harvest			1
but , he adds , there 's also a sense of power and ego in knowing the future : " if i can predict things , i have some control and it releases feelings of helplessness or fear , " he says			1
" the more i can predict , the smarter i am and the better i look to others			0
" throw in the chattering , nattering , opinion - splattering classes -- which traffic in confidence and authority -- and you create a stew of statements that seldom veers from bet - the - house conviction			1
in his new book , " @entity70 : why so many predictions fail -- but some do n't , " statistician and @entity74 creator @entity72 looked into almost 1,000 predictions of the @entity77 - based " @entity78 " pundits			1
they were about half right -- no better than a coin flip			1
these @entity84 insiders " displayed about as much political acumen as a barbershop quartet , " @entity72 writes			1
compare that with weather forecasters , @entity72 says in an interview			1
the profession , which has improved consistently over the years , makes a virtue out of unknowns , such as the " cone of probability " in hurricane tracking			0
" they 're being honest about how much they know and how much they do n't know , " he says			1
" so they 've made progress , whereas people who are trying to make the perfect prediction and take political science and treat it as though it 's physics are failing much more often , " he says			1
an appreciation of uncertainty " requires a dose of humility that the weather forecasters have that the ( pundits ) do n't			1
" numbers overload : polling data hype sways voters ' you find the uncertainty and kind of wallow in it ' we may want to laugh about the " @entity78 " folks -- they 're providing entertainment , not prophecy -- but the overall point of @entity72 's book is that poor predictions can cost society dearly			1
look at the financial crisis , which blindsided most economists , or the early visions of the @entity129 war , which turned out to be anything but the predicted " cakewalk			0
" it 's no wonder that , throughout history , kings and emperors put so much stock in soothsayers , or that tales of @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and the @entity142 at @entity143 are still touchstones			1
we also revel when the experts are wrong			1
an @entity147 mathematician said speedy trains were impractical because they 'd cause breathing deprivation			0
a 1901 critic said only one of @entity153 's works would endure : " the @entity154			1
" and then there 's the founder of the onetime technology behemoth @entity158 , who said in 1977 , " there 's no reason a person would want a computer in their home			2
" @entity158 was bought by home computer - maker @entity166 in 1998			0
( @entity168 has a whole page devoted to such opinions			0
) pollsters should n't get cocky , either			0
in 1936 , the prestigious @entity172 -- which ran what was then considered the gold standard of presidential polls -- proclaimed that @entity177 @entity176 would beat president @entity178			1
instead , @entity178 won the greatest electoral landslide of modern times			0
the digest , suddenly a laughingstock , folded two years later			0
the digest 's failure led to the rise of pollster @entity186 , who brought statistical rigor to polling			2
but even @entity189 could falter : his poll missed the @entity194 - @entity193 contest of 1948			0
futurists are professional predictors , some of them paid tidy sums for their expertise in forecasting the direction society , technology and nations are moving			0
@entity204 , an architect and chairwoman of the @entity206 , says the key to good forecasting is knowing what you do n't know and doing your research			0
" as a futurist , you find the uncertainty and kind of wallow in it , " she says			2
" you make sure the uncertainty is explored layer by layer			2
" she observes that context is key			0
we 're always making fun of the fact that we do n't have a " @entity222 " - like present of flying cars , she points out , but seldom think about what 's required to build that kind of society			1
" it 's not the innovation , it 's the diffusion of it , " she says , pointing out that we 'd need to create a whole infrastructure for such vehicles ( which do exist )			2
" it 's enough to have the @entity234 dealing with all the planes in the air			2
what if every single car was a plane ? " people ( like , perhaps , sports talking heads or @entity77 pundits ) often believe predictions are " a single scenario , " she adds			1
" futurists believe in futures with an 's , ' meaning multiple scenarios			2
and the only scenario that is n't going to happen is business as usual			0
you ca n't just take today and multiply it out and call it tomorrow			0
" which is one of the issues in interpreting polls			2
too often , observers look at what is so often characterized as a " snapshot " of data and jump to conclusions			1
it does n't help , says @entity265 political scientist and polling expert @entity264 , that there are more polls than ever			2
" if you go back to the 1950s and ' 60s , there were only a few polling organizations , " he says			0
" it 's really in the last two or three presidential election cycles that we 've seen a proliferation of polls			1
" moreover , as technology has changed , so have polling methods			0
polling used to be done face to face			0
now it 's all done by telephone -- a much cheaper alternative , @entity264 says , but not necessarily more accurate , what with robocalls , lack of callbacks and sampling challenges based on land line and cell phone users			1
then there 's " rational ignorance " -- the consciously shallow understanding and apathy of many possible respondents			1
there have been movements to counter these flaws , such as @entity299 's " @entity298 , " but the general process remains imperfect			2
some organizations have adjusted well , others have not -- but all the data are thrown into the mix , a haystack of straws for pundits to grasp			2
' town meeting ' or fodder for denialists ? in his book " when the people speak , " @entity311 , a @entity299 political scientist , observed that @entity186 believed polling solved a host of civic ills			2
along with mass media , polling " created a town meeting on a national scale , " @entity189 wrote in 1938			0
instead , many people have used the snapshot statistics as a club with which to pound their opponents -- or they deny their usefulness entirely			1
indeed , these days , some people hold onto their views so strongly that they resist actual facts			2
both parties have fallen into the trap : in 2004 , some democrats , lulled by early exit polls that indicated a narrow victory for @entity335 , claimed that the election had been stolen			2
more recently , some @entity177 have claimed that the polls themselves are skewed			2
in an essay for @entity341 , law professor @entity338 , author of " @entity339 , " asked if @entity177 would accept an @entity16 victory			0
he pointed to a rise in distrust of election results -- from members of both parties -- since the 2000 @entity349 contest			0
" the lesson from these statistics is simple			0
if my guy won , the election was fair and square			0
if your guy won , there must have been some kind of chicanery , " he writes			0
sometimes , says futurist @entity204 , you just have to accept that you do n't know the future until it occurs			0
in the meantime , research , prepare -- and expect uncertainty			1
" anybody who says they know for sure -- they 're lying , " she says			1
" they do n't know			0
there 's always something that can happen			0
" it 's what makes the prediction business so big			0

some people jump to conclusions based on polls , putting uncertainty aside
we 're *uncomfortable* with uncertainty -- hence the market for predictions
@entity74 's @entity72 : a " dose of humility " necessary
when predictions go wrong , some people deny the result
