-- @entity1 cast aside the disappointment of crashing out in the @entity4 group stage , thumping @entity5 4 - 0 in @entity6 on sunday			1
the three points were much welcomed by @entity1 , which exited @entity9 's top club competition in snowy @entity10 , and @entity12 's hat - trick would have pleased the @entity14 striker , too			1
@entity12 also set up @entity16 's headed goal with a free kick			2
@entity12 had only hit the back of the net once in his previous seven appearances			2
even though @entity5 hovered just above the relegation zone prior to kickoff , its play in the last month suggested @entity1 might struggle			1
but @entity12 's early goal -- in the 15th minute -- put the visitor under pressure at the @entity28 in @entity29			2
he added efforts in the 45th and 68th minutes			0
@entity5 rarely troubled @entity1 keeper @entity31 without the services of leading scorer @entity33 -- who is on loan from the @entity1			2
@entity1 , the reigning @entity36 champion , moved six points clear of @entity38 , which visits @entity39 in a high - profile encounter monday			2
and in the league , @entity1 has won eight in a row without conceding			2
" it was a good way to make amends for wednesday , " @entity31 told @entity44			0
" the elimination hurt us , but now there 's another trophy we now have to try and win			0
" veteran @entity52 striker @entity51 returned from injury and provided some relief for @entity56 manager @entity55 , scoring both goals in a 2 - 0 win over @entity59			1
@entity55 was under pressure following a spell of six league games without a victory			0
@entity64 scored his league - leading 13th goal -- three better than @entity12 -- in @entity68 's 3 - 0 win over @entity69			1
in sunday 's late kickoff , @entity70 doubled 10 - man @entity73 4 - 2 to close in on @entity38			1
@entity74 keeps pace with @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity74 rejoined @entity76 on points at the top of @entity80 after a stunning second - half performance against @entity82			1
@entity83 scored twice to tie @entity84 on 17 league goals and @entity74 's less famous team blanked @entity82 3 - 0			1
between his goals , @entity83 was denied from the spot by @entity89			0
@entity82 -- in mid table -- matched @entity74 in the first half but the home side upped the tempo in the second			1
@entity83 worked his way into the box in the 59th minute and @entity89 could n't keep out his low shot			0
@entity89 , however , had little chance on @entity100 's rocket in the 63rd minute			0
@entity89 saved @entity83 's penalty in the 74th minute but @entity83 was fouled again in the box and this time converted in the 81st			0
@entity74 and @entity76 each have 43 points and the same goal difference but @entity76 has scored one more goal			1
the sides meet in early january			0
a good day for @entity109 it was a good day for @entity109 -- and the @entity111 did n't even play			0
@entity109 maintained its seven - point advantage atop the @entity113 after second - place @entity114 slumped to a 1 - 0 loss -- at home -- to struggler @entity118			1
@entity118 last tasted victory in the league in the middle of september			0
@entity123 scored the game 's only goal with a 61st - minute header and @entity118 missed the chance for a second when a penalty was saved in injury time .			0
