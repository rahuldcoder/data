-- football fans could find themselves sitting in seats made from sugar when @entity4 hosts the @entity5 for the first time in 64 years			1
@entity4 has long led the way when it comes to soccer skills , and the country has also shown considerable innovation in developing new technologies			1
the two worlds may meet in 2014 as one of @entity16 's biggest chemical companies hopes to show the way forward with its eco stadium solutions			1
" what we are doing here is showing the world that we have an alternative			2
you can produce plastics from a renewable source , " says @entity24 , @entity25 's commercial director for renewable business			1
sugarcane is an abundant crop in @entity4 , and the firm hopes that it will provide a competitive edge over its renewable energy rivals			1
as well as biofuel , it is used to make green plastic -- derived from plant sources rather than carbon fossil fuels such as oil			1
a landmark deal has already been struck with @entity42 , the home of @entity43 , to first install 2,000 such " sugar seats " and eventually replace all 54,000 of the existing ones in the @entity46 stadium			1
" this technology is not really new , it 's a technology from the 1970s , " explains @entity25 's corporate marketing director @entity48			1
" we had , at that time , a lack of ethylene			2
we developed this kind of technology to develop ethylene from ethanol			0
this new technology that we are using now was developed about six years ago			0
we started producing on a commercial basis since last year in september			0
" the plant in @entity61 in the southernmost state of @entity63 do @entity59 is the first in the world to produce ethylene from ethanol and then create green polyethylene , @entity48 says			2
at this stage it makes up a small proportion of the company 's total output , but -- with 12 stadiums still being built or refurbished -- the @entity5 could provide the perfect stage to spur significant expansion			1
" we are talking to the people that build the arenas			0
we want to have the solution in @entity4 that we can have sugar seats made from 100 % @entity4 sugarcane			1
it would be very , very nice for everybody , " @entity48 says			0
the @entity42 group has a partnership with @entity25 's parent company @entity87 and the multinational @entity88 to develop the renovated @entity90 stadium in @entity91 for the @entity5			1
@entity93 chief executive @entity92 believes the sugar seats could feature at the tournament as @entity4 's national team seeks a record - extending sixth title and first since 2002			1
" there 's a high probability to do so			0
the ethanol is a real @entity4 product , and the resources are available in @entity4 , " he says			1
" this will be a very interesting product for @entity5 stadiums			2
because it 's a @entity4 product i 'm sure it 'll be supported on the @entity4 side			1
we hope this product will be pushed as much as possible			0
" the @entity46 group is also working on the new @entity113 venue in the northern city of @entity115 , which will have an extra year to be completed as it will not be used for the @entity118 event which will also be held in @entity4			1
while @entity42 has the goal of being the world 's first carbon - neutral venue by 2015 , the @entity4 stadiums did not have the same sustainability aims inbuilt when football 's ruling body @entity126 awarded the tournament in 2007			1
" but we are trying to get as many elements into those stadiums			2
one of the things is using rain water in a careful way and also using solar energy as much as possible , " @entity92 says			0
" the designs for the @entity5 stadiums were from 5 - 6 years ago and we were not involved then			1
we are trying to retro - fit these things			0
" he says the @entity42 has made big steps to achieving its goals -- changing to recyclable or reusable materials , negotiating deals to use " waste " energy from local suppliers and becoming independent in part through solar energy			1
talks have begun to purchase two big windmills			2
" in a day to day situation we can already provide our own electricity ; on match days when we peak in our usage , we have to get energy from the net , " @entity92 says			0
" in the day we deliver energy to the net			0
" the @entity93 's model is centered on profitable fulltime operation , meaning the venue is used for concerts and other entertainment events as well as sport			0
a similar approach is being introduced in @entity91 , where the group is showing organizers not just how to build the stadium but also how to run it and sustain it in the long term -- including a deal with the local university to make sure suitable workers will be trained and available			1
" one of the concerns always , especially from the government , is that there wo n't be any white elephants left after the @entity5 , that stadiums wo n't be used anymore , " @entity92 says			2
" we are focused very much on a user program so that the stadium in every sense has a place in society			0
this stadium is in a very interesting city with a lot of music and dance and entertainment and shows			0
" he says @entity42 's main challenge now is to reduce patrons ' reliance on cars to get to the arena			2
this means promoting public transport , and therefore cutting carbon dioxide levels			0
one such tactic is combined tickets incorporating travel , match entry and dining options			0
but for @entity25 , the big obstacle is convincing stadium contractors -- the 12 venues are all being built in private - public partnerships with the government -- that green technology is better than traditional means			1
" the most important thing with our product is you can put it straight in the processing machines and you do n't need any kind of investment			0
they do n't have to adapt their machinery , " @entity24 says			0
ever - increasing clearance of @entity220 rainforest is a big environmental issue in @entity4 , but @entity48 says this is not a problem with sugarcane , which ca n't grow properly in such wet climates			1
" we still have a lot of land that we can use much better in the way of producing goods , " he says			0
this has been a landmark year for @entity25 's green arm , with deals agreed with big corporations such as @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and high - end fashion house @entity238			1
from 2013 @entity25 will also be able to produce green polypropylene , which will increase its range of plastics alternatives			1
in football terms , that could mean deals to provide goal nets " once the customer decides and says , ' i 'm just going to buy renewable material , ' we will have the material and we will be able to produce it more , " @entity24 says			2
" we still have to develop a lot of technology			0
we are doing it , we are investing a lot to develop this kind of material			0
it is much more important that the customer decides they want to go towards this material			0
" @entity48 says the company will continue to push the cause of fossil fuel alternatives			2
" we announced we were going to make polyethanol in 2007 and we did it			0
we have a very risk - taking culture at our company , so we just announced it and we did it			2
now we are ready to do much more			0
we can fulfil that -- it is a market need , a real one			2

@entity4 company hopes that its " sugar seats " will feature at the @entity272
@entity25 already has a deal with @entity42 to install its green plastic chairs
@entity46 group is also involved with development of two soccer stadiums in @entity4 for 2014
@entity25 has agreed green deals in @entity284 market with several big corporations
