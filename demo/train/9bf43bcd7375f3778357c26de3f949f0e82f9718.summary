@entity0 , @entity1 a @entity4 runner - up , @entity5 , now admits her obsession with beauty -- and cosmetic surgery -- almost killed her			1
@entity5 , 27 , launched her career as a model and reality tv star with a face and body sculpted in the operating room			1
" i 've had more than 10 surgeries , " she told @entity2			1
" my nose , my cheekbones , my jaw			2
i injected my lips numerous times , changed my breasts twice and did liposuction two times			2
" in 2012 , she got second place in the uniquely @entity1 contest known as @entity4 , or @entity27			1
" i idolized my body , so it had to be perfect , " she said during the interview in the @entity0 apartment she shares with her 9 - year - old son			1
her agent brought out the before - and - after pictures			2
first , snapshots of a thin teenage mom nicknamed " beanpole , " smiling and hugging her baby			2
in the more recent pictures , her body fills out : pouty lips , enormous breasts and her now - famous derriere as well as voluptuous thighs			1
" i had plastic surgery like going to the supermarket , " she said			0
" i wanted to take out ribs to have a slimmer waist			0
i wanted to cut off my toes to wear smaller shoes			0
" eventually , the medical procedures took their toll			0
last november , @entity5 was rushed to the hospital in septic shock			1
she spent weeks in intensive care , then in a wheelchair			0
hoping for more curvaceous thighs , @entity5 had taken large quantities of anabolic steroids			1
then , she injected her thighs with hydrogel and a plastic known as @entity62			1
by november , the tissue in her legs was rotting			0
pictures taken at the hospital show huge , gaping ulcers			0
more than two months later , she is still getting her legs drained			0
we accompanied her on a doctor 's visit			0
" back when @entity5 injected the hydrogel , she put in 10 times the amount allowed , " said plastic surgeon @entity71			1
" it 's injected into the muscle and fat and skin , and it 's difficult to remove			0
" after the bad publicity , authorities said they would n't renew the license for hydrogel to be used in @entity1			2
now @entity5 is warning against excessive vanity			1
" i hope those injuries , those holes can be an example to warn women that there is a huge risk			0
you have to respect the limits of your body , " she said			1
@entity1 , according to the @entity94 , surpassed the @entity95 in 2013 as the country with the most cosmetic surgical procedures -- 1.45 million			2
while @entity95 women received more breast implants than their @entity1 counterparts , @entity1 got 64,000 buttock augmentations , almost six times more than @entity95			0
unfortunately , many women take shortcuts or seek doctors who are n't qualified but are willing to try more risky procedures			0
" if my doctor had n't been willing to put the 500 milliliters of hydrogel in each leg , i would have gone to four or five doctors , getting a little bit from each one , " @entity5 said			1
according to the @entity114 , there are 5,500 recognized plastic surgeons in @entity1 , but nearly 12,000 doctors perform cosmetic procedures without proper training			2
the demand for cosmetic procedures spikes in the summer months and especially ahead of @entity121 , when many women seek a nip and tuck before they strip down to their glittery bikinis in carnival parades			2
doctor @entity71 said the problem is cultural , but it is also medical , noting that 10 % to 15 % of patients " have psychiatric issues , " more specifically body dysmorphic disorder			1
" they look in the mirror and they 'll always find something wrong , " @entity71 said			0
" like me , " @entity5 said			1
after her nightmarish surgeries to remove hydrogel from her thighs , @entity5 said , she 'll never go under the knife again			1
but she also would never go back to the way she looked before			0
" i like the way i look now , " @entity5 said			2
" it 's good to take measures to improve your looks , just not excessive measures			0
" @entity147 , the world 's plastic surgery hub			0

2012 @entity4 runner - up @entity5 had " more than 10 " cosmetic surgeries
after steroid , hydrogel and @entity62 injections in her thighs , she suffered septic shock and was hospitalized
the lesson she hopes this *teaches* is , " you have to respect the limits of your body "
