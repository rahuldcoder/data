-- the image of the @entity3 bullet train streaking past @entity4 is a powerful part of the iconography of the resurgent post-war @entity7			1
introduced in 1964 , just months ahead of the the @entity8 , the bullet train represented everything that @entity7 wanted for itself : a sleek , cutting - edge and reliable mode of transportation			2
the average annual delay of a @entity3 train is 36 seconds -- even accounting for earthquakes and typhoons			2
the @entity3 network transports around 930,000 passengers every day			1
during rush hour , bullet trains leave urban stations around @entity7 as often as every six minutes			2
but nearly 50 years on , @entity7 's hi - tech wonder desperately needs an update			2
with the fastest speed of @entity3 trains at a " mere " 320 km / h ( 200 mph ) -- and some of its technology decades old -- @entity7 is now facing intense rivalry not only from @entity28 train giants @entity29 and @entity30 , but also @entity31 , whose 10,000 - km ( 6,200 miles ) " gaotie " track currently in operation is the world 's longest high - speed rail network			1
it has become crucial for @entity7 to search for a new technology so as not to lose its title as a pioneer and leader of high - speed rail , and to drive billions of dollars in contracts			1
for @entity7 's prime minister @entity44 , the answer lies in maglev , or magnetic levitation , trains that can reach speeds of 506 km / h ( 315 mph )			2
" it is truly a dream technology , " @entity44 said in a speech at the @entity50 in september			0
maglevs use powerful electromagnets to float and propel a swiftly moving train above its tracks , eliminating metal friction			0
@entity7 currently holds the world speed record for a manned maglev train , hitting 581 km / h ( 361 mph ) in 2003			1
high speeds , high costs the costs for these next - generation trains are eye - watering			0
@entity7 expects to spend more than $ 100 billion on the recently announced proposal to build a maglev rail to run the 286 - km distance between @entity67 and @entity68			1
with 246 km , or 86 % of the route , running through tunnels in the mountainous region -- a massively expensive undertaking -- there are concerns that the service , which is not due to operate until 2027 , could become a high - speed white elephant			1

it also has plans to extend the run from @entity67 to @entity87 in 2045			2
despite the dream of slashing the 100 - minute journey between @entity67 and @entity68 down to 40 minutes and the 145 - minute journey from @entity67 to @entity87 to 67 minutes , the project is facing considerable skepticism			1
according to @entity7 's @entity94 , by the time the first @entity67 - @entity87 maglev glides down the track in 2045 , @entity7 's population will have declined to 105 million from the current 127 million			1
critics say there will simply not be enough demand for the high - speed service			1
" basically , @entity79 is the most profitable train operator in @entity7 , but looking forward , a lot of their earnings will be used up for the capital expenditure in this project , " says @entity101 , transport analyst at @entity102 in @entity103			1
" that 's the reason you 're seeing some investors being pushed away by that -- especially by the very long time frame for this project to become operational			0
" see more : @entity7 's @entity116 , world 's best unknown hike even apart from the problem of demographics , @entity101 says that the @entity7 of 1964 -- when its economy was booming and its population was young and expanding -- was very different from the @entity7 of today			0
" i can see why some people are quite negative on the project , " he says			0
" if you look at the @entity7 of the past 20 years , the economy has not really been growing -- it 's been in a deflationary environment			0
at the same time the population is declining -- there just are n't enough babies there			0
" whether they will need such a service as the maglev in 30 years time is a big question mark			0
" maglev between @entity136 and @entity137 ? meanwhile , @entity79 is also seeking to export maglev technology overseas			1
last month , it held a maglev road show for @entity141 politicians , taking them on a test ride in central @entity7			1
with the offer of bankrolling billions of the operating costs for a maglev link between @entity136 and @entity137 -- cutting the current three - hour journey down to one hour -- the company reasons that if the @entity141 invests in its technology , then others will follow			1
see more : @entity7 's trains as safe as they are fast for @entity44 , it might be a hard sell , but one that has received his full backing			0
" making use of this technology would connect @entity136 and @entity137 , in less than an hour			0
it would free people from the congested roads that frazzle their nerves while saving not only 443,000 gallons of gasoline but also 682,000 hours of time that are now wasted annually , " the @entity7 leader told the @entity50 " in @entity7 , preparations are already well under way even now towards opening the @entity67 to @entity68 section			1
but before that , let 's first connect @entity169 and @entity137 i have already presented president @entity171 with a proposal to do exactly that			0
" even with the sweetener -- which would involve @entity7 providing the maglev guideway and propulsion system free for the first portion of the @entity136 to @entity137 line , linking the @entity141 capital and @entity169 -- doubts remain			2
" for the @entity141 it 's all about jobs , " says @entity101			0
" if the project provides enough work then it may invest			0
" " the real test of whether @entity7 can export this technology will come ( when ) they actually have the maglev up and running rather than just talking about it			2
" @entity0 's @entity188 series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

the @entity3 network transports around 930,000 passengers every day
a pioneer of high - speed rail , @entity7 faces intense rivalry from @entity31 and @entity28 train giants @entity29 and @entity30
train company @entity79 plans to build a $ 100 billion , 286 - km maglev track to between @entity67 and @entity68
it also plans to export its technology overseas , *pitching* an offer to the @entity141
