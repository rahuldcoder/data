@entity0 -- arguing that @entity7 founder @entity6 has " weakened the organization , " a newly organized rival to the website known for leaking official secrets says it will launch monday			1
the founders of @entity10 say they are former @entity7 members unhappy with the way @entity7 is being run under @entity6			1
" it has weakened the organization , " one of those founders , @entity12 says in a documentary airing sunday night on @entity17 television network @entity16			0
he said @entity7 has become " too much focused on one person , and one person is always much weaker than an organization			1
" in an e-mail to @entity1 , @entity12 said the group hopes to launch its site monday			1
like @entity7 , which facilitates the anonymous disclosure of secret information , @entity12 says its goal is to help people deliver material to news outlets and other organizations without being identified			1
the @entity17 daily @entity32 , citing internal @entity12 documents , reported that the new site intends to act as an intermediary , " without a political agenda except from the dissemination of information to the media , the public , non-profit organizations , trade and union organizations and other participating groups			0
" @entity12 said @entity7 put " everything we had " into the high - profile disclosures of hundreds of thousands secret @entity45 documents over the past five months			2
" i think the wisest thing to do would have been to do this slowly , step by step , to grow the project			0
that did not happen , " he says in the @entity16 documentary			0
@entity6 and @entity7 have been the focus of worldwide condemnation since their first major release of classified @entity45 documents in july			1
since it began disclosing more than 250,000 @entity45 diplomatic cables in november , it has been hit with denial - of - service attacks , been kicked off servers in the @entity45 and @entity62 and lost major revenue sources			0
and @entity6 has been held in a @entity65 jail since tuesday as he battles extradition to @entity17 , which wants to question him about allegations of sexual assault			2
@entity6 has denied any wrongdoing , and supporters have called the charges an attempt to strike back him and his organization			2
but @entity12 said , " if you preach transparency to everyone else , you have to be transparent yourself			0
" " you have to fulfill the same standards that you expect from others , " he told @entity16			0
" and i think that 's where we 've not been heading in the same direction philosophically anymore			0
" another former @entity7 staffer said he had brought up his discontent with @entity6 , but that the @entity7 founder had not wanted to listen			1
" eventually this ended with me arguing with @entity6 about basically his dictatorial behavior , which ended in @entity6 saying to me that if i had a problem with him i could just ' piss off , ' i quote , " @entity87 said			1
@entity7 spokesman @entity91 would not discuss disagreements between @entity6 and other members of the organization			1
but as for the planned launch of a rival group , he said , " the more , the better			0
" " well , i 'm inclined not to talk too much about the people , the few people that have decided that their interest is not with @entity7 anymore , " he told @entity16			2
" what i hear is that some of the people are contemplating to open up their own website with the same ideal as @entity7 and i think that is an excellent idea and i wish them well			0

@entity10 says it plans to launch monday
an @entity109 member says @entity6 's behavior was " dictatorial "
" the more , the better , " a @entity7 spokesman says
