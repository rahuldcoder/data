affects more than the mind			1
the disorder may damage blood vessels and increase the risk of dying early , according to new research presented today at an annual meeting of the @entity8			1
the study included about 286,000 mostly male veterans between the ages of 45 and 81 who served in @entity13 , @entity14 , and conflicts dating back to the @entity16			2
the vets with @entity1 -- who accounted for roughly 10 percent of the study participants -- had more than double the risk of dying during the 10 - year study compared to their peers who did n't have disorder , the researchers found			1
@entity0 : @entity24 , @entity1 common among @entity13 vets twenty - nine percent of the vets with @entity1 died during the study , compared to 8 percent of the vets without @entity1			1
( the overall death rate in the study was 13 percent			2
) the increased risk of death associated with @entity1 held even after the researchers controlled for factors such as high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes , and smoking			1
a separate analysis involving heart scans from 637 of the veterans found that men and women with @entity1 had more calcium buildup in their arteries than vets without post-traumatic stress			1
calcium buildup is a hallmark of atherosclerosis ( also known as hardening of the arteries ) , which can lead to heart attacks			0
@entity0 : surprising heart attack risks among veterans with similar degrees of calcium buildup , those who had ptsd were 48 percent more likely to die of any cause during the study and 41 percent more likely to die from heart disease compared to those without @entity1 , according to the study , which was led by @entity63 , @entity64 , a cardiologist at the @entity66 @entity65			1
" if a vet has @entity1 , they need to be under surveillance for cardiovascular disease as they age , " says @entity67 , @entity68 , a senior investigator at @entity69 , in @entity70 , @entity71 , and an expert on the link between post-traumatic stress and physical illness			1
@entity67 did not participate in the new study			0
@entity1 is an anxiety disorder that occurs after exposure to a traumatic event , including sexual abuse and military combat			2
people with the condition experience recurring , intrusive memories about the event , and may also experience emotional numbness and detachment			0
@entity0 : traumatized ? playing @entity92 may reduce flashbacks previous studies have linked ptsd to a greater risk of death and heart disease , but the new study is the first to explore what 's behind the relationship			2
the explanation is likely complicated , says @entity101 , phd , an associate professor at the @entity102 , in @entity103			0
inflammation stemming from constant stress may be involved , she says , but other factors or unhealthy behaviors -- such as not getting enough exercise -- may be partly responsible as well			0
" people with @entity1 are trying to make themselves feel better in lots of different ways , " says @entity101 , who did n't take part in dr. @entity63 's study			2
behaviors such as smoking " clearly contribute , but there 's something else going on			0
" it 's not clear from the study whether treating @entity1 can lower a person 's risk of atherosclerosis or heart disease			1
still , dr. @entity63 says that @entity1 should be treated using effective techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy , preferably as soon as possible after the traumatic event			2
" if you do n't treat @entity1 , it 's like a vicious cycle , " he says			0
@entity0 : can @entity130 help ease post-traumatic stress ? @entity67 says that thousands of veterans have contacted him to ask whether they can make disability claims for heart disease and post-traumatic stress to the @entity65			1
" the veteran community is very frustrated right now because they ca n't get a ruling on this [ from the @entity138 ] , " he says			0
" they have to fight each case over and over again , which is not the case for @entity142 ... or other military disability exposures			0
" dr. @entity63 presented his findings at the @entity8 's annual @entity146 meeting , which highlights the latest heart - related research and treatment advances			0
unlike studies published in medical journals , the research presented at the meeting has not been vetted by independent experts in the field			0

post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity1 ) affects more than the mind
disorder may damage blood vessels and increase the risk of dying early
