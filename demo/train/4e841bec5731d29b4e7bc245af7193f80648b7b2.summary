@entity0 -- it used to be said that if the @entity6 economy sneezed , @entity3 and the @entity4 would catch a cold			1
despite the great recession of 2008 , the region has kept growing and avoided , largely unscathed , the troubles that still ail the @entity6			0
the 20 nations that informally make up @entity3 boast a booming economy with a combined gdp of more than $ 6 trillion , according to 2010 estimates by the @entity15			1
@entity3 and the @entity4 , with a population of over 591 million people in 2011 , are a potent market in a region where the @entity6 already has free trade agreements with @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
but with 2,000 miles of a common border between the @entity6 and @entity21 ( its third - largest trading partner after @entity28 and @entity29 ) , a complicated communist presence still in @entity31 , simmering anti-american sentiments in @entity33 , and @entity34 -- the largest economy in @entity3 and the @entity6 's eighth - largest trading partner -- already a formidable economic powerhouse , the region is anything but a stable , sedate space in the @entity40			1
as the @entity6 is actively engaged in a deadly drug war in @entity21 , @entity24 and most of @entity42 and the @entity4 , and an arms deal gone bad is threatening to consume a sitting @entity6 attorney general , the region could easily be seen as a very real security threat for the next occupant of the @entity47			1
so will @entity3 be one of the issues that the eight major @entity51 candidates confront during tuesday 's @entity52 in @entity0 ? you might not think so			1
a @entity55 search of news stories on " national security " and " foreign policy " resulted in articles related to @entity60 , the @entity61 , terrorism and who is advising the @entity51 candidates			1
@entity3 or the @entity4 do n't show up on the first 10 screens			2
still , candidates ignore the region at their peril			2
new president in @entity70 @entity71 , the ailing president of @entity33 , has in the past reached out to @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity60 for arms support and strategic alliances			2
in @entity31 , @entity77 , who took over as president of the country from his older brother @entity80 in 2008 , is only now starting to loosen restrictions on property ownership and instituting other reforms on the socialist island just 90 miles south of @entity85			0
a fence along the border and then there 's immigration			0
in recent debates , it has been considered more of a domestic issue , with proposals from the major candidates for a single fence , a double fence , an electrified fence and other fence variants along the border with @entity21			1
@entity100 , who had been surging in polls but is starting to slip , said that he supported a fence along the @entity21 border			2
" when i 'm in charge of the fence , we going to have a fence			0
it 's going to be 20 feet high			0
it 's going to have barbed wire on the top			0
it 's going to be electrocuted , electrified , " @entity100 told a rally in @entity113			0
" and there 's going to be a sign on the other side that says it will kill you			0
" he apologized for the comment , saying " it was just a joke , " but a day later said he still supported some sort of electrified fence that could kill people trying to cross the border illegally			0
rep. @entity124 , who was popular early in the @entity51 race but has since fallen back to single digits in some polls , said she supports a two - part fence			0
" i was the very first candidate that signed a pledge that said that , by a date certain , i will build a double - walled fence with -- with an area of security neutrality in between			0
" most @entity51 candidates have opposed most proposals for immigration reform until the border is " sealed , " although the @entity139 administration states that border security is tighter that it has ever been			1
@entity141 reported last month that the @entity139 administration deported nearly 400,000 illegal immigrants in the last year , a record number for the third straight year			0
staying out of their business if @entity3 and the @entity4 do come up in the discussions tuesday , rep. @entity146 probably will be applauded by the region for his proposal not to meddle in other countries ' affairs			2
he may not get the same applause in @entity3 , however , for an idea -- shared by his some of his rivals -- to eliminate much of @entity6 foreign aid to the region , which worldwide accounts for less than 1 % of the federal budget			2
gov. @entity157 presented a formal proposal for @entity3 focusing on trade and singling out @entity33 and @entity31			1
@entity100 says he will follow guidance from @entity31 in @entity85 on what to do about @entity31 and the embargo			0
@entity157 : i wo n't let @entity74 get nukes meanwhile , gov. @entity165 would send @entity6 troops to help fight the war on drugs in @entity21 , although that country most likely would n't accept them			2
former house speaker @entity170 , who appears to be the most informed of the candidates on the region by far , says he 's learning @entity173 and follows issues beyond the standard talking points on @entity31 , @entity33 , @entity177 and @entity34			1
the current crop of @entity51 candidates would be wise to pay attention to the looming security presence posed by @entity3 , whether it is drugs in @entity21 , cartels in @entity24 , @entity182 in @entity31 , or a @entity71 in @entity33 .			1

@entity3 has a booming economy with more than $ 6 trillion in gdp
deadly drug war in @entity21 and @entity24 , *tensions* in @entity33 make region a concern
several @entity51 presidential candidates have weighed in on the *volatile* region
