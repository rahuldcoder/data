@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a late afternoon in early june , undercover police officers circled a one - story highway motel north of @entity5			0
@entity6 was a 12 - year - old girl who told her mother she was being forced to work as a prostitute			0
according to her mother , the girl had started running away from home earlier this year			0
she found out her daughter was in the sex trade when she saw her in an adult online classified ad			1
the girl was advertising herself as a 24 - year - old with a bogus name			0
the next time she ran away , her mother reported her missing			0
read the police press release according to police and anti-trafficking advocates , the internet has now become the preferred way to sell women for sex			0
it 's fast and convenient for the pimps and relatively safe for the men who pay for sex			2
instead of trolling the streets , they can now look through hundreds of girls from the safety of their homes or hotels			0
this time , the girl was lucky			0
she called home , and the call was traced to a @entity39 in @entity0 , @entity1 , where police were quickly on the scene			0
they rescued the girl and arrested a 42 - year - old man and charged him with human trafficking			0
of all the sites that offer " adult services , " @entity45 is one of the most popular			1
the online classified ad site is used regularly by about 50 million @entity50 for everything from buying used lawn furniture to finding a job or a roommate			1
it 's also used to sell sex , making @entity45 a prime target of a nationwide campaign against internet prostitution			1
" most of the young women we 've worked with who have been exploited online talk about @entity45 , " said @entity60 of the anti-trafficking group @entity61			1
" @entity45 is like the @entity66 of online sex trafficking right now in this country			1
" according to police who investigated the case of the missing 12 - year - old , she had previously advertised on @entity45 under a false name and age			1
@entity45 declined to provide copies of the ad , citing privacy concerns			1
@entity45 founder @entity79 defended his site , saying it is doing more than any other site that hosts adult ads to help filter out underage prostitutes and report them to police			1
in 2008 , under pressure from state prosecutors , the website raised the fees for posting adult services ads. in 2009 , it started donating portions of the money generated by adult ads to charity			1
@entity45 also began to manually screen all ads and said it would refer any suspected underage girls to law enforcement			1
that 's not good enough for anti-trafficking activists			2
for all its reforms , they say @entity45 still has no way of knowing whether the females being sold are women or girls and is doing too little to help police identify and rescue children who are being sold for sex			2
a @entity2 investigation of @entity45 's " adult services " section , which replaced " erotic services ads " two years ago , counted more than 7,000 ads in a single day			1
many offered thinly veiled " services " for anything from $ 50 for a half hour to $ 400 an hour			2
many of the ads had photographs attached , and in many of those it was difficult to tell whether the female was an adult or a minor			2
ads with words suggestive of youth , like " young " and " fresh , " received a flood of responses from men who clearly expected sex in exchange for money			2
one 20 - year - old said it 's the easiest and cheapest way to get customers			2
a 20 - year - old identified only as " @entity138 " works out of low - rent hotels on @entity5 's busy @entity141 corridor			2
she posts ads mid-morning for $ 10 and says she earns up to $ 250 from each man who answers and shows up			2
she told @entity2 her " man " -- her pimp -- was good to her , but that the vast majority of the females who post ads are run by pimps who force them to have sex with as many as a dozen men a day			2
she said many of the prostitutes give everything they earn directly to the pimps			0
if they do n't , they 're beaten			0
" girls are called ' yes bitches ' and ' no bitches			0
' yes bitches are what the pimps want , " @entity138 said after applying makeup to cover bruising on her face			0
" my advice is if you 're doing this to be a yes bitch			0
otherwise , you 're going to have a very hard time			0
" just how many of the ads include children is extremely difficult to establish , but many of the photos that accompany the ads on @entity45 are questionable			1
a classified posted alongside @entity138 's ad in the @entity5 market showed an @entity177 - @entity50 woman in her underwear offering herself for $ 250 an hour			2
like dozens of other pictures posted the same week , her face appeared very young			0
according to internet research firm the @entity180 , @entity45 this year is expected to earn a third of its revenue -- more than $ 36 million -- from its adult services section alone			1
@entity180 's summary report on @entity45 @entity45 says any increased revenue is partly because it was required to charge more for adult ads under a 2008 agreement with government officials intended to curb the volume of online adult ads. but the amount it is earning has opened the website up to charges that it 's profiting from the exploitation of women			1
according to its own rules , @entity45 requires anyone using its adult services section to immediately report any suspicious ads to a national tip - line run by the @entity203			1
the head of @entity5 's @entity206 anti-prostitution unit said @entity45 " never " reports suspicious ads to his department			1
" it does bother us from a law enforcement perspective , because the problem is so rampant that you know to get a handle on it we need all the assistance we can get , " metropolitan police inspector @entity209 said			0
" if they 're notifying , i 'm not sure if they 're notifying the right people , because we 're not getting a call			0
" @entity45 spokeswoman @entity220 told @entity2 in an e-mail that of all the websites that offer adult services ads , @entity45 is the leader in pushing users to report any suspected violation			1
she said the site cooperates fully with law enforcement , and that fewer than one ad in 10,000 meets the @entity203 's guidelines for anti-trafficking action			1
@entity220 also noted that @entity45 requires anyone posting an ad to give the website a phone number , which is verified as being real			1
she said that because @entity45 follows the @entity203 's guidelines , the percentage of ads in its adult services section that are in fact children is " effectively zero			1
" the head of the @entity203 said his group has recently started to get referrals from @entity45 , but that it has no direct say in how @entity45 determines what ads are worth reporting			1
" we are not a part of their initial screening and review process , and do n't see exactly what their screeners see or know how they make their determinations as to what is actionable and reportable , " director @entity248 wrote in an e-mail to @entity2			0
" we are now getting reports from them regarding suspected violations and that is a good thing			0
the key question is -- are they doing enough ? " to another national advocacy group , the @entity267 , there 's only one answer to @entity45 's adult services dilemma : shut it down			1
the @entity267 has published open letters to @entity271 from a former underage prostitute who says her pimp forced her to sell her body and used @entity45 to drum up customers			2
" we hear this story every single day of girls who are being bought and sold , @entity50 girls who are being bought and sold through the internet , " said @entity276 , executive director of the @entity267			0
@entity282 's commentary on @entity2 she believes many @entity50 are either unaware of just how many girls are being sold on sites like @entity45 or simply chose to ignore the problem			1
" i think we have an easier time looking at these girls when they are in @entity290 or @entity291 and being thoughtful or supportive of those girls , " @entity286 said			0
" but when those girls come from @entity294 , or @entity295 , @entity296 , or @entity297 , @entity298 , we are challenged at being able to see them as victims			0
it 's much easier to call them bad girls or girls acting out , as opposed to recognizing these are girls who are vulnerable , who are being raped and exploited			0
