the latest blizzard dumped 8 to 15 inches of snow across parts of seven states but saved most of its fury for the @entity11 and @entity12 , the @entity10 said			1
snow showers and blowing snow were expected to linger monday across the area			1
more than 1,000 miles away , residents of the @entity4 spent the weekend digging out from a storm that dumped several feet of snow across the region			1

according to @entity33 reports , nearly 70 people were injured in sunday 's storms , with at least 61 of those in @entity27			2
@entity35 begins recovery in the @entity4 , the heavy snow that fell over the weekend was still causing problems monday			1
@entity39 , a spokesman for the @entity40 of @entity41 , said monday the roofs of 16 homes and buildings had collapsed because of the weight of the snow piled atop them			1
the storm 's toll rose to 11 when a man and woman were found dead in a car in @entity53 , apparently due to carbon monoxide poisoning , @entity39 said			1
five of the nine other fatalities were in @entity57 , along with one in @entity58 , one in @entity59 and two in the @entity62 province of @entity63			1
in @entity65 , @entity57 , mayor @entity64 said the city had gotten some 30 inches of snow			1
as of monday morning , 10 % to 20 % of it had been plowed , with the city 's main roads expected to be cleared by tuesday morning , secondary roads by thursday and friday , and residential streets by sunday , he said			1
@entity65 is no special case			1
" i 've talked to other mayors ; we 're all buried , " he said			1
@entity77 soldiers were helping pick up emergency - center workers and retrieve operators for pay loaders , he said			2
abandoned cars were making the task difficult			2
" the plows ca n't get through ; pay loaders have to work surgically to try and remove these cars and get the streets cleared , " @entity83 said			2
on sunday night , he said , only two tow trucks were available to the city ; the rest were snowed in			2
by monday , six tow trucks were operating , he said			1
alternative forms of transportation were n't much better			2
" it took me 40 minutes to walk four blocks from my house to the @entity97 , " he said			2
about 200 people were in shelters sunday in southeastern @entity57 , gov. @entity98 said			1

the @entity110 reported that recovery efforts were in motion , and the @entity113 dispatched eight rapid assessment teams to look at conditions in coastal communities			1
the paper reported that thousands of @entity77 soldiers were assisting			2
" the devastation we have seen here would lead one to believe that it 'll be days before we get power back , " said @entity118 , a state representative for the @entity59 towns of @entity120 and @entity121 , where about 90 % of customers were without power late sunday			0
in @entity59 , about 113,000 customers were still without power monday afternoon , with the greatest concentration of outages in the southeastern and @entity133 regions , said gov. @entity134			2

the @entity24 and @entity173 may see severe storms monday , with heavy rainfall and gusty winds , the @entity33 said			1
warmer weather daytime temperatures were expected to climb monday into the 40s in much of southern @entity57 , @entity180 and @entity59 , where rain may fall as well			1
that would help melt snow , though it could make what 's there heavier and increase the risk of roof collapses			0
there were reports sunday of a barn , a sports facility , commercial buildings and other buildings suffering cave - ins , @entity189 said			0
freezing rain will change to rain as temperatures warm in the @entity4 on monday			1
but overnight lows will dip below freezing , causing melted snow to refreeze on roads			0
a weak system will move through the area on wednesday and will drop dustings of snow across the area , but the system should clear out by thursday morning			0

flights resumed sunday at @entity148 's @entity217 and @entity146 restored limited service			0

" lots and lots of snow the blizzard that began burying the @entity4 on friday was historic by many measures -- most of all , by the amount of snow that fell			1
in @entity232 , @entity57 , for instance , 40 inches of snow made it difficult for plows to get on the roads			1
@entity236 said streets there had transformed into " white , wide , soft blanket ( s ) of snow			0
" tornado strikes in the @entity104 @entity243 depths still led to major headaches , especially when combined with hurricane - force wind gusts , storm surges and snow drifts			0
" there 's a ton of snow , and there 's nowhere to put it , " said @entity248 of @entity148 , where 24.9 inches fell			0
" so it 's really frustrating to find nooks and crannies			0
" many still without power about 270,000 utility customers were in the dark late sunday , down from 635,000 a day earlier			0
the outages were the result of a combination of whipping winds and power lines sagging , and sometimes snapping , under the weight of wet snow and ice			0
the storm by the numbers " there was a phenomenal amount of trees that went down , " @entity118 said , noting that no @entity121 residents had power sunday morning and estimating it may be thursday before all the lights are back on			0
