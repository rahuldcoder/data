-- illegal immigrants can qualify to pay cheaper in - state tuition rates at @entity6 public universities , the state 's @entity1 ruled monday			1
the @entity6 @entity1 's unanimous decision reversed a ruling by the state court of appeals and allowed the state 's higher education institutions to continue their policy of allowing certain unlawful immigrants to pay in - state rates			1
the lower court had ruled that such immigrants , even if they lived and studied in @entity6 , should be treated as " nonresidents " when it came to how much they paid to go to these schools			0
the @entity1 decision addressed federal laws , which appeared to restrict some education - related benefits for illegal immigrants , and state laws , which appeared to authorize such people to receive in - state rates if they qualified			1
a @entity6 state law , which took effect in january 2002 , said those " without lawful immigration status " -- if they qualify on other grounds -- can get in - state tuition rates if they have " filed an application to legalize his or her immigration status			2
" but the plaintiffs in the case pointed to a federal law that stated illegal immigrants can not qualify " for any postsecondary education benefit " ( in this case , lower tuition rates ) if other @entity45 citizens did n't get the same benefit			0
in its decision , the @entity6 @entity1 found that federal law did not trump state law in this case			0
@entity45 citizens from outside @entity6 , it pointed out , could receive in - state tuition as long as they attended high school in @entity6 for three or more years and either graduated from a high school or got their ged in @entity6			1
the court further stated that illegal immigrants should be treated like anyone from outside @entity6 , calling it significant that not all illegal immigrants would qualify for in - state tuition rates , just those who met the criteria			1
" we conclude the exemption [ from paying full , nonresident tuition rates ] is not based on residence in @entity6 , " the @entity6 @entity1 decision said			0
" rather , it is based on other criteria			0
" the decision applies to 112 community colleges , 33 universities and two independent postgraduate schools in @entity6 's public postsecondary education system			2
@entity73 , general counsel for the @entity74 that represents 23 schools that educate almost 433,000 students statewide , applauded the decision			0
" [ the ruling ] appropriately expands access and educational opportunities to all legitimate @entity6 high school graduates , " @entity73 said in a statement			1
" [ @entity6 's public university system ] continues to advocate that racially and ethnically inclusive college universities better prepare students for the diverse workplace of the future			2
