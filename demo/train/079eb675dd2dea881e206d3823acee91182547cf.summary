-- @entity1 's dramatic week ended in disappointment as @entity3 claimed a 2 - 0 victory in the @entity6 derby at @entity7 on sunday to leave their rivals second from bottom of the @entity11 table			1
@entity13 's @entity1 side came into the match on the back of a tumultuous last seven days which saw the club finally sold to the owners of the @entity20 baseball team			0
and all the disruption off the pitch continues to transmit into poor results on the pitch , as goals either side of half - time from @entity28 and @entity29 gave @entity3 a deserved win			1
both teams came into the match struggling near the foot of the table , with @entity3 17th and @entity1 18th in the 20 - team division			1
however , the home side dominated throughout and took a deserved lead when @entity28 thundered home a shot after good work on the right from @entity43			0
and the points were secured five minutes after the interval when @entity46 midfielder @entity29 was given too much space on the edge of the area to fire home through a crowd of players			0
the result lifts @entity3 up to 11th place but only goal difference now separates @entity1 from lying bottom of the table , their lowest - ever @entity11 position			1
meanwhile , @entity59 are up to second place in the table after a hard - fought 3 - 2 win at newly - promoted @entity63			1
after a goalless first half , @entity59 took the lead whan captain @entity65 flicked home a cross from substitute @entity68			0
@entity63 levelled when @entity69 glanced home a @entity72 free - kick , but @entity59 immediately went down the other end and @entity65 fired home a deflected shot to restore the visitors ' lead			2
@entity68 then scored a delightful third goal , skipping past a couple of challenges before curling home a superb strike , before the home side pulled one back in injury time through @entity86 to set up a nervy final two minutes			0
@entity87 continue to lead the table with 19 points from their eight games , but big - spending @entity59 are now just two points behind the defending champions on 17 points			2
@entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 are all level in third place on 14 points , with the @entity100 ahead on goal difference .			0
