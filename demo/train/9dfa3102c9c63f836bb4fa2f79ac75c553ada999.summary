-- bookworms eagerly awaiting the next title from their favorite author may have a new way to access those books early			0
@entity6 is launching a program that releases select books to @entity9 readers a month before they go on sale to everyone else			1
called kindle first , the program lets readers pick one of four books a month , chosen by @entity6 editors from a variety of categories			1
this month there 's a romance novel , some literary fiction , a mystery and an inspirational book based on a disco song			2
the books will be officially released everywhere in december			0
@entity26 is free to @entity28 members , while other people will pay $ 1.99 a month for their book			1
@entity6 will announce the book selections every month via e-mail			1
