@entity0 -- here are six things you learned on " @entity4			0
@entity5 jitters in @entity6 : the special @entity8 election in @entity6 's 13th @entity9 is tuesday , but many plugged - in @entity5 there are predicting defeat -- and are already finger pointing			1
it 's a competitive district , but the seat has been in @entity5 hands for decades , so a win by @entity18 @entity17 would sting the @entity5 , and no doubt set off a round of debate about the party 's midterm election strategy -- despite the fact history suggests the results of special elections often say very little about what will happen come november			1
again , let 's await the results			0
but already many @entity5 involved in the race are complaining the party is falling short of its promise to make dramatic improvements in its use of data and technology to identify and turnout voters			1
@entity5 outreach : @entity39 of the @entity40 made note of another @entity5 promise being called into question			2
remember after @entity46 's 2012 loss , there was a pledge for much more aggressive @entity5 outreach to younger voters , women , @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity39 noted that at this weekend 's big @entity60 " there was strikingly a lack of a message still at this point to these voter groups that they have had such a tough time with ... they are going into all of these communities but they are still figuring out what they are going to say and so i think we need to watch very closely as to whether there is any evidence that they are making progress on that front			1
crushing his critics : @entity74 of @entity75 noted the dramatic shift from @entity78 @entity5 leader @entity77 : usually silent about his primary opponent and conservative groups that attack him , now suddenly he vows to " crush them everywhere			2
" in a new radio ad , @entity82 specifically attacks the @entity84 , which had made a name for itself the last few cycles by supporting primary challenges to @entity5 establishment figures			2
" so the gloves are not just off , they are in another room , they are under the bed , " is @entity74 's take on the @entity82 shift			0
" it just seems that they are going to go hard			0
the right stuff ? : look for @entity99 gov. @entity98 to highlight his anti-abortion views as part of an effort to show the conservative @entity5 base it 's unfair to dismiss him as just another @entity105 moderate			1
@entity106 of the @entity107 shares a conversation with @entity98 's top political operative			1
" all he was telling me about was @entity98 's pro-life record and at @entity60 we heard that from @entity98 , " @entity106 said			1
" my predictions is in the coming months as @entity98 continues to travel ... he 's going to emphasize that pro-life record , looking ahead to @entity115 and @entity116 in the 2016 campaign			2
deep chill : one person @entity98 apparently is n't interested in persuading is fellow gov. @entity120 of @entity121			1
@entity1 's @entity123 took us behind the @entity60 curtain to show how the deep chill between the two 2016 prospects continues			2
@entity98 is chairman of the @entity128 ; @entity120 is the vice chairman			1
" i 'm told that these two did n't even cross paths backstage , there was no time set up to meet - even say hello in this green room where all these stars were crossing paths , " @entity123 reports			0
" @entity120 spoke right after @entity98 and they did n't even talk afterward			1
" a flashback to @entity120 's frosty defense of @entity98 over @entity140 a month ago : 6			1
hamlet on the @entity141 ? former @entity143 sen. @entity142 and key allies are suddenly sending signals he intends to jump into the 2014 @entity78 race in @entity147			0
@entity142 has been debating for months about whether to challenge @entity152 incumbent @entity151 , torn , friends say , about whether he should instead run for president in 2016 , or just forgo running for elective office again			0
well a number of @entity5 sources in @entity147 report receiving calls in recent days from @entity142 or his top allies , and there 's word from @entity5 operatives that there are conversations about building a @entity78 campaign staff			2
so all systems are go ? not so fast			0
because @entity142 has been pondering this for months , the @entity5 activists i spoke to say they wo n't believe it until he makes a public statement or files candidacy papers			2
the wait for @entity142 's final answer may be short			0
" i will make an announcement sooner , rather than later , " he told @entity171 of @entity172 on thursday			0
" obviously , it 's a very , very big decision -- a very , very big decision for me and my family			0
and i 'm going to make sure that i cross all @entity176 's and dot all i 's			0
so it will be sooner , rather than later , and i 'll certainly let everyone know .			0

the special election for @entity6 's 13th district is tuesday and the @entity5 predicts defeat
*republicans* at @entity60 had little to say to women , minority and young voters
@entity98 is to focus on his anti-abortion message
@entity98 and @entity120 have little to say to each other
