having secured @entity3 's passage to the @entity8 quarterfinals by scoring the goal that ultimately knocked out @entity11 's @entity10 , @entity2 then had the chance to embellish a rare display of confidence with a late penalty			1
could this be the moment that the @entity17 , who looked unusually fired up after being denied what he thought was a penalty before then suffering a bloodied nose , finally began to feel settled at @entity21 ? for those who have followed @entity2 ' stop - start @entity25 career , the scenario was all too familiar as he crashed his 86th minute penalty against the crossbar - before looking to the heavens in despair			0
that he was even prepared to take the penalty told its own story for a man who can boast @entity34 and @entity35 medals is not known for his prowess nor confidence from the spot			0
indeed , when he stepped up against @entity40 in a 3 - 1 league win at the @entity42 last december , the successful effort was -- remarkably -- the first he had ever scored in the @entity43 since arriving in 2007			0
with reports surfacing of @entity2 having turned down the chance to join big - spending @entity48 side @entity47 , this seemed the chance for the striker , who celebrates his 29th birthday next week , to banish his woes and restore that absent friend of his : confidence			2
but as the ball cannoned against the woodwork , the former @entity56 star may have felt that there is an invisible barrier blocking his path at @entity3			2
" he was working hard and he took his chance great -- but obviously , it 's a pity that the penalty did n't go in for him , " said @entity3 goalkeeper @entity62			0
nonetheless , @entity2 ' strike in the 71st minute was enough to see @entity3 through on a tense night -- meaning the @entity25 stay on course to become the first side to win @entity70 's top two club competitions in reverse order in successive seasons			0
trailing 1 - 0 from the first leg in the @entity11 capital , @entity74 's side leveled matters as @entity78 squeezed the ball home after 33 minutes -- but @entity82 ' equalizer ( and away goal ) on the stroke of half time gave the game a very different complexion			0
making a rare start after a season disrupted by knee problems , captain @entity88 restored @entity3 's lead before @entity2 scored only his second goal in 20 games to register a 3 - 2 aggregate win			1
the victory capped a productive night for @entity98 clubs as @entity3 , @entity99 and @entity100 managed to partly atone for the failure of their @entity43 counterparts in the @entity103 -- none of whom made it into the last eight			1
spurs were involved in the day 's most dramatic game as they took a 3 - 0 lead to @entity110 -- only to find themselves level on aggregate after 90 minutes as the rampant @entity112 scored through the lively @entity113 , @entity114 and a @entity116 own goal			1
but six minutes into extra-time , the previously quiet @entity117 silenced @entity110 's fans when poking home a vital away goal			0
the @entity122 boasted the unusual record of having scored for @entity99 against @entity110 at the same @entity125 stadium where he had netted for @entity127 against @entity128 -- a rare feat -- but this was a mere aside when @entity131 made it 4 - 4 on aggregate with ten minutes to go			1
but @entity99 -- who badly missed the suspended @entity135 -- held on , to leave coach @entity136 with the chance of repeating the 2011 @entity8 triumph he achieved with @entity140			0
" we have learned massively from our last two ties in the competition , against @entity145 and @entity110 , " said the visibly - drained 35 - year - old after the game			2
while @entity99 hung on for victory , @entity100 achieved theirs deep in stoppage time as @entity148 headed home -- at home -- against @entity47 for a 1 - 0 aggregate win			1
@entity48 clubs had a mixed night with @entity153 winning 2 - 0 at home against @entity154 , but only after extra-time , while @entity156 went out against @entity157 , beaten 2 - 1 on aggregate after @entity159 failed to score an 86th - minute penalty that would have taken the game into extra-time			1
elsewhere , @entity162 scored a hat - trick as @entity164 completed a comfortable 5 - 1 aggregate win over @entity166 with a 3 - 1 win in @entity168 while @entity170 's @entity169 , one of the strongest teams left in the @entity8 , knocked out @entity173 4 - 2			1
@entity174 joined @entity103 quarterfinalists @entity175 in extending @entity178 's interest in @entity180 competition as they completed a 2 - 1 aggregate win over @entity183 side @entity182 .			2
