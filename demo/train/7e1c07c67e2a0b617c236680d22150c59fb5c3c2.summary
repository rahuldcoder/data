@entity0 , @entity1 -- battered by the current economic recession , @entity1 's economy could get a strong boost from two key sporting events			1
the @entity7 this year was played at @entity8 in @entity0			1
it will return there in 2011			2
the @entity11 's @entity7 will return to @entity0 in 2011 -- an event that is expected to bring millions of dollars in revenue			1
honolulu mayor @entity14 is also hoping to lure the 31st @entity15 -- but not to his city			2
he 's actively supporting @entity18 's bid to host the @entity19			1
" how does that play out for @entity1 ? well , obviously if we get the @entity24 -- that is ( the ) @entity25 -- we benefit from a @entity27 campaign that we 'd like to see with visitors coming prior to @entity18 to @entity1 or after , and visiting other parts of our country , " the mayor said			1
" what i really want to do is promote @entity1 as a great place for some of these teams to come and do a little @entity35 ( rest and relaxation ) or training before they go on to the @entity24 in @entity18			1
" @entity14 will head to @entity18 , @entity39 , this weekend to court @entity41 members , who are in the @entity42 to evaluate its plan to host the @entity15			2
on october 2 , the @entity41 will choose among @entity18 ; @entity45 , @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 ; or @entity49 , @entity50 , as the 2016 host city			2
@entity14 co-chairs the @entity52 , along with @entity18 mayor @entity53 , which he said aims " to bring the @entity24 to @entity25 in 2016			1
" @entity1 's economy is heavily dependent on tourism , and the economic recession means fewer people are visiting the island state			1
with three - quarters of the state 's population living in @entity0 , @entity14 said , workers are especially hit hard in the capital city			0
" the slowdown in tourism has resulted in shorter hours , in some cases even a decrease in their wages , and hopefully a last resort is some of them are being laid off as a result of some of these businesses going out of business , " he said			0
" so our job is just to continue to do what we can to work with private industry to shore up the tourism industry			0
it is our no. 1 industry , nothing comes close			0
" tourism accounts for between $ 10 billion and $ 12 billion each year compared to @entity1 's second - largest industry , which is military spending , according to @entity14			1
that accounts for between $ 3 billion and $ 4 billion annually , the mayor said			0
last month , the @entity90 voted to allow the @entity11 's pro bowl game to return to @entity1 in 2011 and 2012			1
the game has been held the week after the @entity93 at @entity8 in @entity0 since 1980 , and has sold out every time			0
next year , it will take place in @entity96 , @entity97 , before the @entity93 -- raising concerns that it will not be as much of a draw because no @entity93 players will participate in the game			0
@entity1 authorities agreed to allow the game to return to the state under the condition that the @entity11 would consider returning the @entity7 to the sunday after the @entity93 " depending on the success , or failure , of the 2010 game in @entity96 , " according to the @entity11			1
@entity14 said the tens of thousands of people who attend the game annually have then spent " at least $ 30 million " across the state of @entity1			2
losing the game would not only be an economic loss for the state , but a " major downer " for residents , he said			0
" people ( have ) said , ' oh , my goodness , now we lost the @entity7			2
we 've had it here for over 20 years , it 's been a sell - out			0
what 's going on here ? ... everything 's going to go out of @entity1 , ' " @entity14 said			1
" so i got involved , i went and talked to some of the commissioners there , i changed their votes , and we 're able to keep the @entity7 here			2
" but hosting the @entity7 will come at a cost			1
@entity1 will have to pay $ 4 million each year it hosts the game			2
in a recent commentary in the @entity129 newspaper , writer @entity126 questioned whether the cost of hosting the game would come at the expense of projects more vital to residents -- such as a long - awaited rail transit project			1
" do n't get me wrong : i like the @entity7			0
i 've been to several			0
it 's a great show			0
but our own citizens , and our own football team , should come well before the @entity11 , " @entity126 wrote			0
@entity14 insists that despite the recession , he will be able to deliver on his campaign promise of a public rail system in @entity0 , which is scheduled to break ground this year			0
" even under the rubric of a stimulus package , we 're going to get some monies there to push this out , " @entity14 said , noting that @entity1 's senior @entity25 senator , @entity143 , is the chairman of the @entity144			1
he also said the measure is supported by president @entity151 , who was born and grew up in @entity1			0
" these are tough times , but if there 's a necessary project -- what i call a need - to - have versus a nice - to - have -- i 'm going to make all the justification in the world and then we 're going to do it , " he said .			0

@entity11 's @entity7 will return to @entity1 in 2011
mayor hopes @entity18 gets the @entity24 -- and that attendees stop off in @entity1
@entity1 's economy is heavily dependent on tourism
one writer questions the cost of hosting the @entity7
