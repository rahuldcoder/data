i am a @entity2 - speaking @entity1			1
i am ethnically half - @entity2 , as my father was born in @entity4			2
i spent much of my life in @entity6 , a @entity2 - speaking area of @entity1			1
now i live in @entity7			0
my kids speak @entity1 in school and with many of their friends , and we speak @entity2 at home			1
when my son 's fourth - grade teacher talks to me , she speaks @entity1			2
we do n't even notice that our conversation is in two languages			0
i understand @entity1 but do n't speak it as easily as i speak @entity20			0
i just never had any pressure to learn it			0
in @entity23 , in the western part of @entity1 , most speak primarily @entity1 , but even there , i never had anybody look down on me for my @entity2			1
in the eastern and southern regions , many people speak @entity2 , and there is absolutely no forced " @entity28			0
" you might be asking what all this fuss is about in @entity32 , the autonomous region of eastern @entity1 with strong ties to @entity2			1
why are thousands coming to the streets with @entity2 flags ? it 's easy to explain			2
tracking the crisis in @entity1 as it unfolds many people in @entity32 and eastern @entity1 do n't want the protection of @entity2 president @entity40			1
but there are some who are afraid of forced @entity28 because they have been fed propaganda by @entity2 tv channels for years			0
the purpose is to convince @entity1 that we are divided , not one country , and that the safest course of action for @entity2 - speaking areas is to break away and join @entity2			1
these ideas have been cultivated since i was a child			0
i remember when i lived in @entity6 in the ' 90s , how scared we were that a candidate from western @entity1 would win an election and force us to speak @entity1			0
but when i moved out of the area of aggressive @entity2 information , i quickly realized i can speak @entity2 in @entity7 or @entity23 and no one will ever be upset with me ! over our 22 years of @entity1 independence , fears of language or ethnic persecution have never come true			1
but they were kept alive by @entity2 propaganda			0
we understand that @entity40 is trying to escalate tension and provoke civil war in @entity1 right now			0
he ca n't afford for a free @entity1 to succeed : his own people might get an idea that it 's possible to overthrow a tyrant and build a prosperous country			1
@entity72 meets to discuss @entity1 crisis @entity40 wo n't succeed			0
@entity1 are wiser than that and wo n't kill each other over the nonexistent problem of language			0
to demonstrate that , last week , people in @entity23 ( traditionally @entity1 - speaking ) spoke only @entity2 all day , and in response , those in @entity6 ( traditionally @entity2 - speaking ) spoke @entity1 ! no civil war in @entity1 , mr. @entity40 ! it must be getting harder to justify the presence of military force to " protect " people when nobody is in danger			1
i just talked to my friends in @entity32			0
@entity88 in @entity89 told me that it 's a handful of @entity92 extremists in the streets trying to make a scene for @entity2 video cameras -- they are showing that these are the @entity2 who request protection ! meanwhile , the rest of the city is terrified by the presence of @entity2 military forces and are evacuating their families to central or western @entity1			1
i got a similar report from @entity105 in @entity106			0
she said that a large group of @entity2 were brought across the border by buses , and they were the ones inspiring and instigating unrest that resulted in putting a @entity2 flag on a municipal building			2
the amount of propaganda @entity2 has poured onto @entity1 is hard to comprehend			1
putting troops on @entity1 land is going to bring the very opposite result from what @entity40 expected : i believe it 's uniting @entity1			2
meanwhile , @entity2 and @entity40 are getting into deeper isolation from the world as more and more countries are recalling their ambassadors from @entity2 and condemning the government 's actions			2
good job , mr. @entity40 ! thank you from all of us @entity1 ( @entity2 and @entity1 - speaking ) for uniting @entity1 against your military aggression			1
are you in @entity1 ? have you witnessed the unrest there ? share your stories with @entity134 , but please stay safe .			2
