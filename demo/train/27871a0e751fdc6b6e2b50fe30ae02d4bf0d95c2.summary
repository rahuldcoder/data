-- the wait is over for @entity5 @entity4 's many @entity3 followers , and they have been quick to respond to the much anticipated first tweet from his personal account wednesday morning			1
using the handle @entity9 -- meaning " bridge builder " in @entity11 -- he posted : " dear friends , i am pleased to get in touch with you through @entity3			1
thank you for your generous response			0
i bless all of you from my heart			0
" a flood of tweets expressing joy , admiration , antagonism and skepticism followed from the @entity24 , not to mention a fair few jokes			1
" wow ! is this true ? ! pope @entity4 has started tweeting ! welcome your @entity26 ! i 'm grateful for your blessing ! follow him ! " tweeted @ @entity30			1
" our pope @entity4 has a twitter account ! @entity5 in history ! " wrote @ @entity35			1
" @ pontifex welcome on twitter			0
glad you are now reachable to openly discuss gay marriage , birth control and gender equality ! " said ‏ @ wimremes			0
some are more skeptical about the pontiff 's personal involvement			1
why the @entity5 and @entity47 turn to @entity3 " for the first time in history , a man can communicate directly with some low - level press officer in @entity53 , " tweeted @ @entity48			1
a @entity53 official told @entity0 last week that the pope would compose the tweets for the new account himself			1
but while the pontiff pressed the button to send his very first tweet , others are expected to send future tweets on his behalf			1
the pope followed up his first message with two more tweets within minutes			1
" how can we celebrate the @entity69 better in our daily lives ? " asked one			0
the answer : " by speaking with @entity72 in prayer , listening to what he tells you in the @entity76 and looking for him in those in need			0
" this prompted comment that the pontiff had missed the point about social media being interactive			2
" @ @entity84 is answering his own tweets now			2
that 's not really how it works , your holiness , " said ‏ @ exitthelemming			2
the pope 's venture into social media has also sparked a flurry of jokes			1
comedy writer @entity95 tweeted : " @entity96 shalt not covet your neighbour 's @entity3 followers			1
" " i hear he 's changing it to ' thou shall not covet thy neighbour 's wifi , ' " was another tweeter 's humorous take			2
an hour after his first tweet , the pope had around 700,000 followers on his @entity110 - language account			1
he is also tweeting in seven other languages , including @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
this prompted admiration from some fellow tweeters			0
" brilliant that @ @entity119 in 8 languages simultaneously incl			0
arabic ... : truly pioneering , " said @ gsurya			0
" not even i could manage 8 @entity3 accounts			1
i suppose @ @entity84 has @entity124 on his side , " remarked @ @entity123			0
however , not everyone was impressed			0
" so disappointed that @ @entity84 did not write his first tweet in @entity11 , " said @ laiabalcells			2
the secretary of the @entity130 , monsignor @entity131 , told @entity132 that the sending of the first tweet was " an extraordinary moment			2
" the attention it sparked within the " twitterverse " was quite impressive , he said , with more than 2,000 retweets in under two minutes			0
@entity53 officials said last week that anyone could send in a question to the pope 's personal account via the hashtag # askpontifex or # @entity145			1
pope @entity4 has some previous experience at tweeting , having launched the official @entity53 news site on @entity3 , @ news_va_en , in june of last year			1
other religious leaders have found great success with @entity3			2
the 140 - character limit for tweets allows for short messages , perfect for small verses of scripture or inspiration			2
the @entity157 ( @ @entity157 ) , @entity158 ( @ @entity159 ) , @entity160 ( @ @entity161 ) and scores of other religious leaders spread their messages via the site			0
a commentary written by @entity53 spokesman the rev. @entity167 for @entity132 last week said : " 140 characters -- the number contained in a tweet -- are quite a few			2
most of the verses of the @entity76 have less ; the beatitudes are much shorter			0
a little concision is n't bad			0
" he added that while short messages on @entity3 could not carry the whole teachings of the @entity179 , they would help spread the word to those who wanted to hear			2
" of course the world will not be saved by tweets but among a billion baptised @entity179 and among the seven billion people of the world ; several million people will be able to feel the @entity5 is closer in this way too , hearing him say a word for them , a spark of wisdom to bear in their minds and hearts and to share with their twitter friends , " he wrote			1
" a new service of the @entity76			0
" while @entity4 is the first @entity179 pope to take to @entity3 , he is n't the first twitterized pope			1
that honor goes to @entity198 , the 118th pope of the @entity199 of @entity200			0
but @entity201 has around 6,300 @entity3 followers ; @entity4 had tens of thousands on his first day out			1
@entity203 , who preceded @entity4 , was the first pontiff to use the @entity204 , and the 20th century saw a string of other milestones for popes using technology to reach the masses			1
pope @entity210 made the first papal radio broadcast in 1931			0
his successor , pope @entity212 , made the first papal television appearance in 1946			0
@entity0 's @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
