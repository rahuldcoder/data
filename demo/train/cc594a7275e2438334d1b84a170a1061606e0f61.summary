@entity0 -- so little is known about @entity3 leader @entity2 that the identity of a woman seen by his side during more than one official engagement has sparked a flurry of speculation worldwide			1
was the slim woman in the sharp black suit his sister , wife or even lover ? no one seems to know , and @entity17 of @entity18 in @entity19 , an expert and author of a number of books on @entity3 , said it was unlikely speculators would ever find out			1
" everything related to @entity27 's children is a deadly secret			0
no sane @entity3 who knows it would share this out for very special reasons , " @entity17 said			1
the mystery woman accompanied the young leader to a @entity36 theater on friday night to watch a performance of @entity3 's @entity39 band			1
the display included a cast of @entity43 characters , attracting the attention of the @entity43 , which issued a statement tuesday saying it had not authorized their use			0
@entity48 says young @entity3 leader ' has a choice ' away from the stage , the young woman 's presence raised questions too about the purpose of the performance and the message the leadership was intending to convey			1
a statement released by the @entity60 ( @entity61 ) saturday made no mention of either the @entity43 characters or the woman who was seen in official photos distributed worldwide standing and clapping at the end of the performance			0
friday 's outing was n't her only high - profile appearance at the @entity3 leaders ' side			1
the same woman was seen on state tv sunday walking a few paces behind @entity2 as he toured @entity75 in @entity36 , then standing to attention at @entity2 's side as they and top military officials paid tribute to his grandfather @entity80 , @entity3 's founding father , on the anniversary of his death			1
the presence of a female companion to the leader during an official engagement was unusual , @entity17 said , and could be part of a campaign to present @entity2 as " much more approachable , human - like and soft on people " than his father , @entity27			1
" he travels much more than his father and even than his grandfather			0
he likes to hug everybody , physically hug			0
in this regard it 's probably he decided that it might be a good idea to hint that he does have a wife , " @entity17 added			2
definitely a wife , @entity17 stressed , because the public appearance of a leader 's girlfriend or lover would be unthinkable			1
even the wives of his father and grandfather stayed firmly in the shadows during their decades in power			0
" when his grandfather 's first wife , if you like the founding mother of the dynasty , was alive , her name was never , never mentioned in media			2
her existence was never even hinted at , " @entity17 said			2
there was no reference to @entity80 's first wife before her death and for many years there was no mention at all of his second wife , @entity17 added			2
" it took 15 years before the existence of his wife , his second wife , was ever mentioned in press , " and even then it was in passing , he said			0
@entity3 leader makes second public speech in @entity19 , the image of @entity2 's companion made newspaper headlines			1
a report in @entity19 daily @entity140 said the woman " seemed to be " @entity2 's sister , @entity142			1
" born in 1987 , @entity143 is now in her mid- 20s			0
she apparently went to a school in @entity148 along with @entity2 in the 1990s , " the newspaper 's website said			2
her brother @entity2 came to power in december 2011 after the death of their father , who led the impoverished country for 17 years			2
very little was known about @entity2 when he was granted the title of supreme leader ; his age is still a source of speculation , though it 's thought he 's in his late twenties			1
" three years ago the only thing we knew about him was his existence , " @entity17 said			2
" until , say 2010 , as far as i remember we did n't even know how his name was correctly spelt in @entity3			0
" @entity17 said it was too early to say whether the tweaks to @entity2 's public image indicate change ahead for the country			1
" this appears to be the beginning of some change , but what it 's too early to say			0
it might just be a minor change in style			0
it might be something more consequential , i do n't know			0
i would not speculate right now , " he said			0
