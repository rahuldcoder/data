-- waking up to realize you suddenly have no leg or legs is as horrible an experience as one can have , and one that will , sadly , be faced by a number of people injured in the bombing of the @entity9			1
it happened to me when i was 16 after a bone cancer diagnosis and amputation ( the cancer later spread to my lung and caused a lung to be removed as well )			1
as i looked down in the recovery room to where my right leg used to be , all i saw was a short stump			1
this is frightening for sure , and only one of the things you 're dealing with after an amputation			2
luckily perhaps , your entire being is consumed just with healing ; the bigger issues come later			0
first thing to deal with is massive physical pain from the surgery , and it will be worse because of the shrapnel packed bombs			0
the explosive force traumatizes the tissues and the fragments injected into the body cause collateral damage			0
modern medicine does well with pain management , so this phase will , luckily , pass quickly			0
for the new amputee , challenges come fast and furious , but so does the natural " fight " that is in all humans			0
my very first challenge was trying to stand on one leg			1
the body and the mind do not adjust immediately to major changes like the loss of a 25 pound leg , so balance while standing up is elusive			1
but it will come and that is a first little victory			0
it 's the first of many little accomplishments that begin to build up one 's zeroed - out self - confidence			1
our bodies heal and adapt well -- the mind is a bigger challenge			0
someone newly disabled naturally has thoughts of " why me ? " as well as feelings of loss , despair and even depression			0
as @entity70 wrote in a wonderful book called " @entity72 , " about a boy who lost his leg to cancer , " you do n't get to choose if you get hurt in this world			1
" bad things happen and all we can do is adapt and move forward			0
terrorists make us lose sight of the real dangers we are pretty attached to all our body parts , so of course there is a sense of loss			0
people do n't study ahead for how they will deal with every possible eventuality that affects the trajectory of their lives			1
this new horrible reality of being disabled is a shock			1
there is fear of the unknown			0
what will i be able to do ? how do i get back to normal ? will people stare at me because i look different ? and it is easy to imagine how this leads to the tar - pit of self - pity			1
but that is not what happens to most people and it wo n't happen with the @entity110 survivors			1
compared with the primitive prosthetics of my youth , modern prosthetics are technological marvels			0
it is surprising to most people , but prosthetics ' most important role is not ambulation : they are a social device to " level the playing field " and allow others to see you as not different			0
today 's computerized knees keep people from falling ( with mine , i have gone seven years without a fall ; before that , for 33 years it happened once a week )			2
they cut energy use for walking in half , and allow normal stair walking			0
but there is a down side			0
a computerized above - knee prosthesis is between $ 50,000 and $ 60,000 , of which the best insurance companies typically pay about 80 %			2
that can be $ 12,000 out of pocket			0
this is where we can help the new @entity9 amputees			0
opinion : getting on with life after terror hits by far the biggest long - term issue for anyone knocked down in life is the loss of self - esteem			1
humans require strong self - esteem for a healthy , happy life			1
as @entity159 said , " self - esteem is n't everything , it 's just that there is nothing without it			1
building back the lost self - esteem is the hardest and most important challenge for the newly disabled			1
how does one do it ? i found that sports were key			2
i liked sports and , of course , physical activity was good for me			2
work harder than anyone else			0
you ca n't help but get good at it			1
that makes you want to work even harder			0
you keep getting better and better at it and then others stop saying you are pretty good , considering you only have one leg , and start respecting you			2
you 've won and your self - esteem rises and takes your happiness up with it			1
i started with skiing , which at first was more " turn , fall , get up , turn , fall , get up " than swooshing down the slopes			0
now i am a double - black diamond ( amputee ) skier			2
i tried biking and every year join a 200 - mile bike - a - thon			2
i added swimming and in may will do my 20th " @entity197 " swim across @entity196			0
@entity199 legs and snake arms : artificial limbs as art the natural challenge - response we all have in us is what will be the biggest help to the new amputees			2
it goes like this : " you ca n't run with one leg			1
" says the amputee , " who says i ca n't ? ! " and he or she will be off and running			1
we know that those with so - called disabilities do n't fall into the pity tar - pit and in fact , do better than they or anyone around them ever thought possible			1
some even excel far beyond what they had ever accomplished before they became " differently abled			2
" @entity226 studied polio survivors in the ' 80s and wrote in " @entity229 , " " polio survivors who were told they would never go to college or get a job became the country 's best and brightest			2
" like who , you might ask ? president @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and many more			0
these polio survivors had significant physical problems but refused the label disabled , and never accepted the word " ca n't			1
" to them , to me , and i predict to these bombing survivors , disability is simply " different ability " ; and just you watch , maybe even " superability			0
" who says they ca n't ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			1

@entity257 lost his leg at 16 , an experience that some in @entity263 blast have had
he says it 's horrible . and it 's challenging physically to adjust , *psychically* even more difficult
but you can , he says . sports *mastery* helps *restore* self - esteem
@entity257 : those hurt can excel far beyond what they imagine . do n't accept " ca n't "
