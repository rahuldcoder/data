-- father , son , husband of a @entity5 , fashion icon , role model , sporting ambassador			2
it is sometimes easy to forget that @entity9 was ever a midfielder of the highest caliber with more than 100 appearances for @entity12			1
he wore a sarong , a headscarf , nail varnish , adorned his body with tattoos and changed his expertly coiffured hair - do practically every week			0
he spoke sparingly and , when he did , it was with a high - pitched , slightly effeminate whine			0
and , as far as anyone could tell , his female partner seemed to make all the important decisions			0
and yet his masculinity was never in doubt			1
can you bend it like @entity9 ? prove it ! send us your videos in the 1990s , we called @entity31 , or a metrosexual			1
he was evidently straight , but never aggressive or even assertive in a traditional masculine way			0
in fact , he seemed mild - mannered			0
he dressed stylishly -- if a little too flamboyantly for many tastes -- groomed himself painstakingly and appeared unembarrassed when asked about his formidable following of gay fans			1
there was a shimmering complexity , a quiet elegance , and perhaps even a sly wit about @entity9			1
footballers , as the world knew them , were hard - boiled characters , who liked a drink and a good play up , especially after a game			0
their reputation was hewn from the granite of working class tradition -- men were tough and affectless			2
we can barely imagine the reaction in the locker room when @entity9 unpacked moisturizer , bronzer , and assorted hair products from his kit bag			1
in the late 1990s , when he first surfaced , only @entity9 could get away with it			1
after all , he enjoyed the adoration of women all over the world , had a pop star girlfriend and soon - to - be wife , and had to fend off advertisers who clamored for his endorsement services			0
he was a man with the world at his feet			0
today , cultural history is unimaginable without @entity9 -- because he helped change that history			1
he slew the image of the unrelentingly macho sport hero and emerged heroically as the world 's first all - purpose celebrity athlete			2
a symbol of a new masculinity			1
and still we have to remind ourselves : @entity9 was never rated as the best footballer in the world			1
and , far from being a hellraiser or a serial womanizer like many a notorious sports figure , he was squeaky clean			0
well , at least until 2004 when the @entity86 tabloid alleged that he had an affair -- something he denied			2
paradoxically , the alleged affair added rather than subtracted from his already iconic status , introducing a dash of devilry and rescuing @entity9 from a kind of borderline piousness , and perhaps issuing a reminder that , despite all the affectations , his manhood was beyond doubt			1
so why is @entity9 the game - changing celebrity athlete ? there were two @entity101 : one the flesh - and - blood mortal who kicked a ball around for a living , the other a character that existed independently of time and space -- a product of our imaginations			1
everyone thought they knew @entity9 and enjoyed a secret relationship with him			1
he was like a blank canvas			0
had he espoused his own views , or aligned himself with great causes he would have spoiled it			0
but he was silent , giving interviews rarely -- and , i suspect , at @entity122 's discretion			1
and while he stayed largely unknown , the @entity9 mystique grew			1
when @entity9 first entered the popular consciousness it was amid feelings of hate and revenge			1
@entity129 - carded in a crucial @entity12 game against @entity131 in the @entity132 , @entity9 was blamed for his team 's exit			1
effigies of him were burnt and he was forced to retreat			0
it 's difficult to imagine the intensity of the loathing back then			2
yet it was crucial in generating interest , even , passion			0
the sight , even the name of @entity9 stirred up powerful feelings			2
football fans may have despised him , but others were just curious			0
and they became more curious as @entity9 defiantly refused to give interviews or make public appearances , save for at the occasional fashion launch or a party hosted by a rock star or designer			2
all this was very un-footballer - like and faintly unmanly			0
by the time @entity9 and @entity122 were married in 1999 , interest in him had extended far beyond the football fraternity			2
his most devoted followers knew nothing of football			0
unlike traditional sport fans , they were not interested in how he played : they were interested in him -- just @entity9			1
at the start of the 21st century , there was only an embryonic celebrity culture ; the fascination we now have for people who make no material impact on our lives and , in many cases , had no accomplishments of note was a new and perplexing development			0
fans knew famous sportsmen and women by their talents and achievements			0
@entity9 was different , he was known for being @entity9 and , in this sense , he was among the first generation of celebrities			2
@entity9 's departure from football will not mean his disappearance			1
he will remain on our tv screens , in our magazines and on advertising hoardings the world over			0
but most significantly , he will remain in our imaginations			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity9 's masculinity was never in doubt , writes @entity191
@entity9 dressed stylishly -- if a little too flamboyantly for many tastes
he became a symbol of a new masculinity
