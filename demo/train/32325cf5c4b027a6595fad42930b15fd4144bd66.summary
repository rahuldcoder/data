@entity0 -- tens of thousands of people are fleeing violence in @entity5 only to be robbed , beaten and starved on boats helmed by human traffickers , according to a new report from the @entity9			1
in the 12 months to june , around 53,000 people left ports in the @entity5 - @entity13 border area -- 61 % more than the previous year -- many with the hope of reaching family in @entity17 , according to the report " @entity19			1
" they paid between $ 50 and $ 300 to board boats carrying up to 700 passengers , some manned by armed guards , many of whom doled out verbal abuse or beatings to prevent their human cargo from moving around			2
some passengers were fed rice and noodles , while others received nothing at all on journeys lasting anywhere from seven days to two months , the report said			0
more than 200 people are thought to have died making the trip so far this year , due to illness , heat , lack of food and water , and severe beatings			0
however , the number of people who have perished at sea appears to have fallen over the past year , the report noted , after people smugglers hired bigger , more seaworthy vessels			2
persecution in @entity5 that so many people , the vast majority @entity52 , are rushing to flee the country is a scathing indictment of the conditions they 're being forced to endure in @entity5 , or @entity5 , as it 's also known			1
of around 800,000 @entity52 living in @entity60 , violence has pushed around 140,000 into temporary camps , while another 40,000 are effectively detained in isolated villages , according to @entity63			1
" it 's a humanitarian disaster , " said @entity63 's @entity64 , who said conditions had worsened , especially since february , when the government barred international aid group @entity67 ( @entity67 ) from working in @entity60			0
the ban was lifted in late july but aid is yet to reach tens of thousands of people , many who are hungry and suffering preventable illnesses in crowded , unhygienic camps			2
" what you 're seeing is people who are leaving @entity60 with very frail health to start with ; people who have been in these camps and face the slow deprivation of food and basic medical services to the point that they 're already weakened , " @entity64 said			0
" they 're getting on these boats , and these boats are landing in @entity86 , and they 're being put in jungle camps where they 're on starvation rations unless their relatives can find exorbitant fees that the traffickers are demanding to release them and send them onto @entity17			1
" the @entity96 report said upon arrival in @entity86 , new arrivals said they were driven through the night in pickups with 15 to 20 other people who were forced to sit or lie on top of one another			1
they were then taken to camps where hundreds of people , including women and children , were held while smugglers phoned family members abroad , demanding more money for their loved ones ' safe passage to @entity17			0
demands " were accompanied by threats or , when payment was not immediate , severe beating and prolonged detention in a smugglers ' camp for up to six months , " the report said			0
malnourished in @entity17 as many as 38,000 people had registered as @entity122 in @entity17 , the report said , noting that since 2013 , many had arrived with serious medical conditions			1
in the first half of this year , more than 140 people had been diagnosed with beriberi , a condition caused by severe malnutrition and vitamin b deficiency , which can cause paralysis and death			0
that 's 12 times the number diagnosed in the previous 14 months			0
" they have faced deprivation , abuse and suffering every step of their way as they try to flee the predations of the @entity5 government , and the local state government and the @entity60 state government , " @entity64 said			1
@entity5 does n't recognize the @entity122 as citizens or as one of the predominantly @entity150 country 's ethnic minorities			1
" i think the international community really has to push very hard on the @entity5 government to accept the reality that these people should be considered citizens of @entity5			2
" for the government of @entity5 to maintain this fiction that somehow these are recently arrived migrants from @entity159 or from @entity13 is absolutely unconscionable , " @entity64 added			1
in a statement following their five - day visit to @entity5 last week , two commissioners from the @entity165 commission on @entity166 said they were " deeply troubled by reports we received of abuses against the @entity170 in @entity60			2
" " no impartial observers question reports of systematic , large - scale and egregious abuses of human rights of this community involving acts and omissions resulting in deaths , injuries , displacement , denial of basic health and other services , denial of freedom of movement , and denial of the right to a nationality , among other violations , " said commissioners @entity172 and @entity173			0
in the past few years , @entity5 's new leadership under president @entity194 has won praise for its efforts to open the once reclusive country to foreign influences and trade			0
however its treatment of the @entity122 continues to cloud its stated commitment to improving human rights .			0
