-- @entity1 fought back from going two goals behind to draw 2 - 2 at home to holders @entity4 in a classic @entity6 quarterfinal that more than lived up to all its expectations			1
@entity4 tore into their opponents in the opening 20 minutes , with only goalkeeper @entity10 standing in their way			2
on at least three occasions , @entity12 stopped his compatriots with world class saves , preventing @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 from getting on the scoresheet			0
that enabled @entity1 to go into half - time on level terms , but that was to end just 30 seconds after the break when a long ball caught out the home defence and with @entity10 coming , and failing , to get the ball , @entity16 coolly lobbed the ball home			2
and the @entity30 striker doubled that advantage 13 minutes later when another long pass caught @entity1 square , allowing the former @entity34 striker to fire home from an acute angle			1
@entity1 manager @entity36 decided to bring on winger @entity37 , and the @entity38 international went on to change the game with his stunning pace			0
just 10 minutes after going 2 - 0 behind , @entity37 cut inside from the right wing , after being put through by @entity43 , before sliding the ball past visiting goalkeeper @entity45 to bring @entity1 back into the game			1
then , with the clock showing five minutes left to play , a superb @entity1 move resulted in captain @entity49 being bundled over by his opposite number @entity51 in the penalty area			1
@entity51 was sent off for the challenge , which deprived @entity49 of a goal - scoring opportunity , and the @entity56 dusted himself down to fire home the resulting spot - kick against the club where he started his career and is constantly being linked with regarding a possible return to the @entity63			2
fabregas , who was rated only 50 - 50 to play in the match because of a knee injury , finished the match limping heavily but a yellow card he picked up in the first half means he will miss the return leg regardless of whether he is fit or not			0
a thrilling encounter also saw @entity1 lose both @entity73 and @entity74 through injuries , while @entity4 defender @entity76 also collected a booking which means he joins @entity51 and @entity49 in missing the @entity63 clash			1
meanwhile , former @entity1 hero @entity79 , who is the @entity80 ' record goal scorer after eight sensational years with the club , was given a heroes reception by the home fans for his first return since leaving @entity85 for @entity4 in 1997			1
although happy with the draw , @entity36 was annoyed with the manner that the two goals were conceded			0
he told @entity89 : " we had a difficult start and @entity4 could have scored two or three goals in the opening 20 minutes when we lost the ball too cheaply			0
" but my players kept going and both sides missed chances			0
we played against a great side tonight but gave away two very cheap goals which is really beyond my understanding			0
" the winners of the tie will face either @entity34 or @entity103 in the semifinals and @entity106 champions @entity34 hold a slender advantage after winning the first leg 1 - 0 at the @entity109			1
a largely disappointing match was settled in the 65th minute when @entity111 found @entity112 , and the @entity114 striker found the bottom corner of the net with a shot from the edge of the area .			0

@entity1 fight back to earn a 2 - 2 home draw with @entity4 after going 2 - 0 down
captain @entity49 scores a late penalty to complete the @entity1 comeback
@entity112 scores the only goal as @entity34 defeat @entity103 1 - 0
