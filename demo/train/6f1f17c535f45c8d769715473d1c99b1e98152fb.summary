on tuesday , @entity8 officials excoriated the plea deal in the court - martial			1
@entity198 , head of the @entity61 local council , told @entity2 that " we have been following this case since 2006 and we were hoping that those soldiers , who killed 24 innocent people , will receive fair punishment			1

" the trial counsel and convening authority has a duty to explain this pretrial agreement in order to safeguard public confidence in the administration of justice , " said @entity242 , senior research scholar and a visiting lecturer at @entity244			0
" the way our military justice system works , " @entity242 told @entity2 , " is that the convening authority , a commander of the unit , makes the central decision			0
" it 's a command - centric system that we inherited from ( @entity260 ) @entity262 agreements are contracts between the accused and the convening authority			1
" the prosecution and staff judge advocate play an advisory role			2
at the end of the day , it 's the commander 's decision to accept or reject a proposed pretrial agreement , " @entity242 said			2

the public ought to have confidence in the administration of justice			0
" @entity242 said he was concerned about the overall trend of justice emerging out of the @entity283 and @entity8 wars			1
" for some time , i 've wondered whether the system was producing the kind of results it should have			0
what has struck me is that it has been difficult for the government to get convictions in a number of cases , and where it has gotten convictions , whether it has gotten significant penalties , " @entity242 said			0
in court tuesday , @entity14 's attorney , @entity89 , told the judge that " @entity14 has been exonerated , his integrity is unfaltering			1
