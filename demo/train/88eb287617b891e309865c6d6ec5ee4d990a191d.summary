the campaigns of president @entity1 and @entity2 do n't agree on much			2
but on one subject , officials from both sides are in sync			0
as the @entity9 primary race goes into its third official month , the biggest winner appears to be the president			2
referring to rivals @entity11 and @entity13 , a @entity2 campaign staffer said , " the only person 's odds of winning are increasing are president @entity1 's , " arguing it was time for @entity18 and @entity13 to depart the race			1
several leading @entity9 have publicly echoed that sentiment in recent days , confronted with poll numbers showing the president 's job approval rating above 50 % for the first time in months -- a far cry from last fall when he was mired in the low 40s			1
the ongoing @entity9 infighting has dragged down @entity2 's favorability rating among swing voters , forced him to awkwardly pivot right from stances that otherwise would have resonated with a broader electorate in the fall and led to a series of gaffes that could have been avoided had the former @entity37 governor sewed up the nomination weeks ago			1
all the while , @entity1 's own campaign machinations have largely skated under the radar , allowing him to appear to be the adult in the room as the @entity9 candidates fight over contraception , illegal immigration , the minimum wage and each others ' pasts			1
in the process , @entity1 's favorability among key voting blocs such as women and @entity53 has jumped significantly			2
and most important , recent surveys suggest the president has rebounded among independent voters , a swath of the electorate that catapulted him to victory four years ago but had abandoned him during his presidency			0
equally disturbing to @entity9 are a series of recent surveys showing the president handily beating @entity2 in a head - to - head contest , a reversal from october when @entity2 held a slight lead			0
that trend led conservative stalwart @entity70 last week to forecast @entity2 is headed for a @entity72 defeat come november			0
ongoing @entity9 sniping has also allowed the @entity1 campaign to steadily build its campaign apparatus behind the scenes , opening scores of field offices in every key state out of which staffers and volunteers methodically resurrect the unparalleled get - out - the - vote effort from four years ago			1
" we 're using this time to build while they 're destroying each other , " top @entity1 adviser @entity84 said earlier this week			2
the campaign has also restricted its advertising to one positive spot on the president 's energy policy , a subject democrats believe will be among the key issues in the fall as gas prices rise			2
the campaign is also set to release a 17 - minute documentary - style video next week showcasing the president 's achievements during his first term			0
at the same time , @entity1 's lack of a direct opponent has allowed him to stay on message and conduct the re-election bid on his own terms			1
conveniently , @entity1 avoids commenting on his likely @entity9 opponent until the nomination is actually wrapped up			1
but that has n't stopped the president from goading the @entity9 at nearly every turn , often trying to upstage them -- like his @entity115 news conference on the @entity9 's @entity116 -- before every key primary this season			0
of course , it was only four years ago when some @entity88 were making similar doom - and - gloom predictions about their own contentious nominating fight , during which then - sen. @entity122 and @entity1 exchanged heated rhetoric well into may			1
but forecasts that such bickering would harm the eventual nominee 's candidacy were all but forgotten two months later when @entity128 offered a resounding endorsement of her onetime opponent at the @entity88 ' national convention			0
meanwhile , fears that @entity128 's ardent supporters would n't vote for @entity1 come november largely never materialized			0
@entity9 are holding out hope for a similar outcome on their side , mindful that most @entity136 are n't paying close heed to the ins and outs of the @entity9 race			0
" i get the feeling there 's a real disconnect between the political class that 's paying attention to all of this and what the public thinks , " said @entity141 , the former press secretary to president @entity142 and a @entity144 contributor			0
he 's predicting that most of the @entity9 infighting will be forgotten once the party rallies around a nominee			0
" i 'm seeing more and more conservatives who are n't @entity2 fans starting to say , ' you know what , it 's time to start fighting @entity1 and stop fighting ourselves , ' " @entity162 , a @entity144 contributor and founder of @entity165 , said earlier this week			1
but senior officials on the president 's campaign argue the parallels between 2008 and 2012 are tenuous at best			2
for starters , the long @entity88 primary campaign four years ago was widely believed to burnish @entity1 as a candidate			1
not so with @entity2 , who has made a string of verbal missteps and shows little sign of getting more comfortable on the campaign trail			0
@entity88 also argue the @entity1 and @entity128 sniping pales in comparison to that of the @entity9 candidates this year , each of whom have spent millions of dollars on negative commercials and have sparred repeatedly during 20 televised debates			1
the result is a @entity9 primary electorate largely unsatisfied with its crop of candidates and showing little enthusiasm at the polls			2
" that lack of enthusiasm among @entity9 is real , and it 's unmistakable , " said @entity191 , the president 's campaign manager , pointing to low voter turnout figures			1
adding to that contention is a recent @entity199 poll showing @entity9 enthusiasm since the fall has ticked down 13 points , to 51 %			1
finally , the president 's supporters maintain @entity1 and @entity128 did not shift leftward on key positions during their primary battle , forestalling the need for an awkward trek back to the middle during the fall campaign			1
in contrast , @entity2 has been forced to embrace more conservative positions on several key issues that could make courting independent voters difficult come november			0
" they think they can wipe the slate clean , " @entity84 said			0
" the @entity136 people take his words seriously and his positions seriously ... we 're going to hold him to them			0

some leading *republicans* think it 's time to wrap up the race
while @entity9 candidates spar , @entity1 campaign can *quietly* prepare for fall
some drawing parallels with 2008 @entity88 campaign , which went into may
@entity9 enthusiasm , support from independents falling as campaign goes on
