-- after the vote in the @entity3 to slash the @entity4 , i wrote a column against cutting food stamps			1
this column generated more than 5,200 online comments and hundreds of e-mails			2
comments reflected , not surprisingly , the tone and tenor of the political debate : a lot of partisan passion , some mutual understanding , animosity based on stereotypes and a lot of misinformation			2
i would like to address some of the typical concerns that were expressed			0
for example , " @entity23 " wrote , " these wealthy @entity24 spend a lot of time running from the typical black person this affects			2
if they came and visited some of these neighborhoods , they would see folks that they know they wo n't give a job to			2
" but who are the people using food stamps ? they 're us			1
the @entity37 , which gathers statistics house by house , reports that @entity40 on food stamps are 49 % white , 26 % @entity42 and 20 % @entity43			1
the @entity44 , a nonprofit polling firm , found in a july survey that self - identified liberals , moderates and conservatives who receive food stamps are in a statistical tie			1
a lot of people who commented on the column wanted to regulate what foodstuffs program participants can buy -- often not realizing that alcohol and prepared foods are banned			2
and many respondents bashed food stamp recipients , declaring they should " get a job , " " stop having kids on my dime " or giving a variation on such cliches			1
" @entity72 " writes to one reader who 's been out of work : " get training to better yourself and do not have kids until you can feed them			2
but do not demand i do all that and support you ... " but the truth refutes the cliches : feeding @entity40 says participation in @entity4 , or the food stamp program , " historically follows unemployment with a slight lag			1
" unemployment increases food stamp rolls , not people with children who go looking for aid			1
and unemployment has been abnormally high because of the recession that began under the previous president			0
in fact , @entity89 found that " under president @entity93 , the number of recipients rose by nearly 14.7 million			0
nothing before comes close to that			0
" with employment increasing , " the @entity96 projects @entity4 participation to begin declining in 2015			0
" @entity99 commented : " there was a work requirement for welfare			0
@entity103 did that during his welfare reform that most working people applauded			0
to make sure he got the votes and make @entity24 look greedy and evil , @entity107 removed the work requirement ... " @entity99 's perception is prevalent on the @entity111			0
but that information comes from a 2012 @entity114 political ad that got it dead wrong			0
@entity107 actually encouraged the states to strengthen their work requirements			0
also , of course , welfare is not the same as food stamps			1
as for food stamps , more than 72 % of all @entity4 beneficiaries are families with children			1
most of the recipients are children ( 48 % ) , the elderly ( 8 % ) and the disabled			1
less than 10 % of food stamp recipients receive welfare payments			1
" @entity129 in @entity130 " wrote , " yes , many do work , but many of them make sure they never make enough to lose their benefits ... " again , the facts refute the assumption			0
@entity4 has strict time limits for unemployed workers : able - bodied adults without children can only get three months worth of food stamps in a three - year period , unless working in a qualifying job training program			1
and how much are the benefits , anyway ? the average monthly @entity4 benefit per person is $ 133.85 , or less than $ 1.50 per person per meal			0
those benefits are low , and for many families , @entity4 benefits do n't last the whole month			0
why do we need to support the food stamp program ? because low - income families experience unemployment at a far higher rate than other income groups			1
because cutting nutritional assistance programs is immoral and shortsighted and protecting families from hunger improves their health and educational outcomes			0
food stamps are an investment in our future			1
being on food stamps can be demeaning			2
cashiers know the difference between the new plastic snap cards and a credit card			0
some food stamp recipients say some cashiers have made them feel uncomfortable and embarrassed			1
maybe we should focus on rewards rather than punishments			0
behavioral psychologists say that 's more effective			0
why not add benefits for making healthy food choices , provide a transition bonus for getting off food stamps or increase job training opportunities and income -- raising minimum wage ? doing so takes courage , compassion and believing in " we , the people			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity190 says her column on food stamps got tons of comments , many misinformed
@entity190 : recipients are 49 % white , 26 % black , 20 % @entity43 ; conservative and liberal
*joblessness* fuels food stamp use , she says ; most funds go to children and elderly
@entity190 : we need compassion , courage to improve program with incentives , job training
