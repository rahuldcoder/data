-- regardless of whether you 're talking politics or automotive technologies , the voting and driving public often gravitates to what 's new and fresh			2
compared to otherwise comparable non-hybrid models , hybrids cost anywhere from $ 1750 - $ 15,000 more			1
this herd mentality suggests that there 's hope in what 's new simply because it 's new			0
focusing on automotive technology , the green trend @entity0 identified at the recent 2009 @entity17 seems to be pushing buyers into two camps : diesel or hybrid			1
but we 'll let you in on a secret : the traditional four - stroke internal combustion engine is n't dead , nor is it irrelevant to the green movement			2
not by a long shot			0
so let 's assume you 're interested in driving green			0
by this we mean you want a fuel - efficient vehicle that reduces your carbon footprint			0
today , the celebrities of the green movement are diesel - and hybrid - powered vehicles			1
here 's a quick review of these different technologies			0
the defining characteristic of the diesel engine is its compression ignition cycle ; this means that the engine uses ultra-high compression ratios in the combustion chamber to ignite the fuel - air charge ( gasoline - burning internal combustion engines use spark plugs to fire up )			1
the defining characteristic of a hybrid is that these vehicles use a combination of electric motors and internal combustion engines ( working in tandem ) to propel the vehicle			1
now that we 've quickly defined diesel and hybrid , let 's take a look at what you need to consider to make a smart choice between these technologies , or not ( do n't worry , we 'll explain )			1
clean diesel technology with the advent of high - pressure direct fuel injection and special exhaust emissions systems , modern automotive diesel engines bare little resemblance to their stinky , smoke - belching forefathers			1
and unlike the truly dreadful diesel engines perpetrated on trusting @entity78 drivers by @entity79 from 1978 - 85 , today 's diesels are reliable			1
@entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82 are adding clean diesel engines to their light trucks in 2010 , but there are several cars and crossovers available this year that prove that diesel engines are viable for today 's @entity78 driver			1
@entity90 autos : most fuel - efficient crossovers the @entity93 was recently awarded " @entity94			0
" past award winners have been hybrids , but the @entity98 's clean exhaust and exceptional real - world fuel economy ( 30 mpg city , 41 highway ) won over the judges			1
while the mileage matters , the @entity93 's pleasant driving demeanor is what will win buyers			1
powerful torque is a characteristic of diesel engines			1
even though the @entity98 's turbo diesel displaces only 2.0 - liters ( about 128 cubic inches ) , with 236 lb - ft of torque , the @entity98 accelerates as if it 's powered by a large gasoline v - 6 engine			1
thanks to this feeling of power , the $ 23,000 @entity93 shapes up to be an excellent choice for drivers looking for more economy than a gasoline - powered @entity98 can deliver ( 21 mpg city / 31 mpg highway )			1
torque is the overriding trait that defines the diesel driving experience			0
torque is the actual power generated by an engine or motor , and in a vehicle , you feel it most when accelerating from a dead stop			0
lots of torque pins you back in your seat			0
a little torque makes you wish you were driving something faster			0
we recently tested a 2010 @entity135 3.0 - liter with a turbo diesel and enjoyed the crossover 's quick throttle response and ever present thrust			1
our real - world economy over hundreds of miles was nearly 30 mpg in this luxurious , 5500 - pound , seven passenger crossover			0
the @entity135 , just like the smaller @entity93 , demonstrated another diesel hallmark : efficiency ( mpg ) at highway speeds			0
the same holds true for the @entity147 diesel and the vehicles it shares its 3.0 - liter v - 6 with , the @entity152 @entity151 and @entity153 diesels			1
the downside of diesel unfortunately , diesel engines are more costly to produce than most gasoline engines , so there is a higher up - front cost when you buy or lease			1
the added cost varies by make and model , but expect to pay $ 1000 - $ 5000 more for a comparably equipped diesel versus gasoline powered car or truck			1
another consideration : diesel fuel is more expensive than gasoline			2
according to @entity172 , an oil industry consultant with 18 years experience , the new ultra low - sulfur fuel that makes clean diesel technology possible required a huge investment by refiners , and this cost is being passed to consumers			2
worldwide demand for diesel fuel is also up , putting further upward pressure on pricing compared to gasoline ( @entity187 ships diesel to the @entity78 at bargain prices )			2
taxes add to the price differential between gasoline and diesel , and @entity172 estimates the difference is another six cents to diesel 's cost - per - gallon disadvantage			1
unfortunately , diesel fuel 's higher cost typically erases most cost saving from its better fuel economy say hi to more hybrids recently , automakers have rolled out hybrids in great supply			2
@entity205 introduced their 2010 @entity207 hybrid			0
@entity208 also recently launched their new 2010 @entity209 , as well as a new hybrid @entity210 , the 250h			0
@entity211 also has new production hybrids , including a new mild - hybrid powertrain for their full - size 7 - series			1
back in november , @entity80 took the wraps off their 2010 @entity218 and @entity219 hybrids , while @entity220 showed the hybrid powertrain for their @entity222			2
@entity90 autos : twenty cars of the future obviously , hybrids are hot			0
why ? it 's their economy			0
because there are several different categories of hybrid powertrains , we 'll generalize the group 's benefit : hybrids use battery - powered electric motors to reduce the energy required from their vehicle 's internal combustion engine			1
most hybrids can operate on only electric power for short distances at city - driving speeds			2
this attribute generates high city - mileage ratings			1
for example , the @entity249 is rated at 50 mpg city , 48 mpg highway			0
likewise , the 2009 @entity253 racks up 34 mpg city , but only 31 mpg on the highway			0
clearly , hybrid vehicles tend to benefit those who frequent lower - speed urban areas rather than long - distance interstate trips			2
@entity90 autos : can i save money by going 87 ? the lows of hybrids unlike diesel - powered vehicles , the highest - mileage hybrids tend to be a bit lackadaisical in regards to acceleration			1
some also exhibit odd driving behaviors			0
for example , the brakes on some hybrids feel unusual because when the brake pedal is pressed , traditional brakes are n't actually slowing the car , a regenerative motor is ( recapturing the vehicle 's kinetic energy , turning it into electricity to store in on - board batteries )			2
hybrids also use electrically - driven power steering			2
these steering systems often have a less direct feeling that 's closer to a video game than a sports car			0
these dynamic differences mean that hybrids can feel odd to drive compared to a more traditional vehicle , plus they highlight the complexity that is systemic with hybrid vehicles			2
the special sub-systems , components , integration , and programming necessary to make hybrids run are nothing short of rocket science			0
of course , cost comes with this complexity			0
compared to otherwise comparable non-hybrid models , hybrids cost anywhere from $ 1750 - $ 15,000 more			2
you 'll want to consider these dollars before you decide whether driving a hybrid makes any sense			0
@entity90 autos : cheap hybrids what engine technology will drive us in 2014 ? diesel engines and hybrid powertrains will continue to offer high - mileage solutions for those willing to pay the required premium			1
many manufacturers , such as @entity93 , @entity135 , and @entity152 see potential for diesel - powered vehicles			2
@entity135 specifically expects the diesel @entity135 to account for about 15 percent of @entity135 sales this year			0
other manufacturers , such as @entity205 and @entity208 , are taking a wait - and - see attitude toward diesels			0
these companies sell diesel - powered cars in @entity187 , and could bring those engines here easily			1
until the cost of diesel fuel drops to be closer to gasoline , company representatives told @entity90 that they are content to focus on hybrids and maximizing the efficiency of their traditional engines			1
what about a normal engine ? this may come as a surprise , but traditional internal combustion engines represent a solid green choice based on their improving fuel economy and comparatively low cost			0
" technologies such as dual variable valve timing , reduced pumping losses , and improved engine control systems will be where mileage improvements in internal combustion engines come from , " @entity208 's @entity345 , a senior powertrain engineer , said			2
" also , the trend toward more forward gears in transmissions will contribute to mileage gains			2
" what this means is that a variety of technical improvements will make gasoline engines more efficient			1
additionally , by adding more gears to automatic transmissions ( including overdrive ratios ) , engines can run more slowly at any given speed , thus saving even more fuel			0
@entity90 autos : how you can get 100 @entity370 according to @entity93 's @entity373 engineer @entity372 , internal combustion engines will continue to improve			0
@entity372 estimates that the fuel economy of gasoline engines will improve 15 - perent in the coming years			1
this is a figure confirmed by engineers from other manufacturers			0
both @entity80 and @entity81 are already introducing gasoline engines with a new type of fuel injection that enhances fuel economy			1
their engines utilize direct injection that helps boost mpg up to 20 percent			0
the plain truth evidence points to a technology battle that 's broader than diesel versus hybrid			2
according to @entity392 , an auto industry insider from @entity393 , diesels and hybrids will certainly become more prevalent , but it wo n't be the tidal wave some are expecting or hoping for			0
by 2014 , he expects hybrids to account for only one in five cars sold in the @entity78 figures provided by @entity400 show that these powertrains accounted for less than five percent of sales in 2008			0
doing the math , this means that 80 - percent of cars and light - duty trucks will remain powered by traditional gasoline engines in 2014 at most , diesel and hybrid technologies help focus the driving public 's attention on efficiency , and that 's a good thing regardless of which engine technology is under the hood of your next vehicle			1
while the tried - and - true internal combustion engine may have fallen out of favor with politicians and the mainstream media , gasoline - fueled engines remain vital to powering @entity78 into the future			1
the good thing is that now you have a choice			0
right now you can go out and buy a diesel - , hybrid - or traditional internal combustion - powered vehicle .			1
