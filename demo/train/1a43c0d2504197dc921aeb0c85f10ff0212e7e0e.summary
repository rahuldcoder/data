@entity0 -- president @entity2 has asked the @entity3 to establish a rule that would prevent hospitals from denying visitation privileges to gay and lesbian partners			1
the president 's thursday memo said , " there are few moments in our lives that call for greater compassion and companionship than when a loved one is admitted to the hospital			2
... yet every day , all across @entity19 , patients are denied the kindnesses and caring of a loved one at their sides			1
" gay and lesbian @entity19 are " uniquely affected " by relatives - only policies at hospitals , @entity2 said , adding that they " are often barred from the bedsides of the partners with whom they may have spent decades of their lives -- unable to be there for the person they love , and unable to act as a legal surrogate if their partner is incapacitated			1
" when @entity38 collapsed during a family vacation in @entity40 three years ago , her partner of 17 years was kept away from her hospital room			0
@entity42 begged and waited for hours to stand by @entity38 's bedside at @entity45 's @entity44 , but it was n't until her partner 's sister arrived that she got any information			0
in the end , the person @entity51 was closest to was relegated to a waiting room as she died from an aneurysm			0
" to hold @entity38 's hand was n't a gay right , it was a human right , " @entity42 told @entity1 on thursday			2
@entity2 requested that the regulation make clear that any hospital receiving @entity60 and @entity62 funding , which includes the vast majority of @entity19 hospitals , must allow patients to decide who can visit them and prohibit discrimination based on a variety of characteristics , including sexual orientation and gender identity			1
read the president 's memorandum ( @entity74 ) the president listed widows and widowers without children and members of certain religious orders among those who suffer under the policy			0
the memo was welcomed by gays and lesbians , who have used the restrictions on hospital visitation as an argument in favor of same - sex marriage			1
" in the absence of gay people being able to legally marry in most jurisdictions , this is a step to rectify a gross inequity , " said @entity90 , an executive at the @entity91 , the nation 's largest gay rights group			2
" because without gay marriage , much more inequities exist			2
" @entity90 said the organization had been working with the @entity2 administration for months on the request , and that it was sparked by the case of an @entity106 , @entity0 , lesbian couple who were kept apart as one died from an aneurysm while hospitalized in @entity45 , @entity40			1
the rule would help hundreds of thousands of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender families , he said			1
@entity2 's memo also requires the @entity3 regulations to guarantee hospitals honor all patients ' advance directives , which include stipulations such as who should make health care decisions if the patient is n't able to do so			1
the memo also directs the department to look into any other health care barriers that pose challenges to such families and make recommendations to the president on them within 180 days			0
he pointed out that @entity130 recently amended its @entity131 to give each patient " the right to designate visitors who shall receive the same visitation privileges as the patient 's immediate family members , regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the patient			0
" @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 have adopted similar laws , the memo said			0
for @entity42 , a call from @entity2 about the order was a humbling experience			1
for years , she pressed the @entity40 hospital for an apology , and never got one			0
on thursday , she received an apology from the president for how her family was treated			0
the key part of the new rule would be that patients would have the right to pick their " circle of intimacy , " @entity42 said , which means her partner " did n't die in vain			2
" @entity1 's @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 contributed to this report .			0

rule *sought* to allow gays , lesbians to visit hospitalized partners
many hospitals have relatives - only policies ; rule would allow patients to decide
gay and lesbian @entity19 are " uniquely affected " by those policies , @entity2 says
