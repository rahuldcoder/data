after years spent fighting in some of the world 's worst wars , former @entity1 @entity0 says she knows what she wants			1
" i want to have my life , " she told @entity7 's " @entity6			2
" " i fought for 20 years for life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness			1
" @entity0 recently came out as transgender			1
she wrote about the experience in a book , " warrior princess : a @entity1 's journey to coming out @entity18			1
" trapped in a man 's body as a man named @entity23 , she deployed as a seal 13 times , including operations in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and elsewhere			1
along the way , @entity0 earned a @entity31 and a @entity32			1
identifying herself as a woman , @entity0 has felt trapped in the wrong body since grade school , but did n't come out until after leaving the military in 2011			1
doing so earlier would have been too big a risk because in the @entity41 , transgender men and women are banned from military service			2
" that 's a chance that -- if i took it -- i might be dead today , " she told @entity7 's @entity46 last year			2
the @entity47 , " @entity48 : the @entity51 , " offers a fascinating glimpse of @entity0 's life			1
" i just wanted to tell someone my story , " she says in the film			2
" and maybe set an example for some of the younger generation -- just say that i 'm still a human being , and i deserve dignity and respect			2
" @entity0 says she deals with " a lot of prejudice out there			1
there 's been a lot of transgender people who are killed for prejudice , for hatred			2
when the book came out -- some amazing support and some amazing praises -- but also some pretty amazing bigotry and hatred			2
" in the film , @entity0 talks candidly about how she reacts to prejudice			1
" i just try to be friendly , and i just say ' hi , how are you doing ? ' you know , ' good to meet you			2
i was that @entity1 , you know , transgender , you might 've seen me on tv			1
' and they go , ' oh , oh wow			2
' and then they realize that maybe trying to get into a fight with me would n't be a good idea			0
maybe they should be nice			0
" @entity0 says she does n't need people to love , or even like , her			1
" but i do n't want you to beat me up and kill me			0
you do n't have to like me , i do n't care			0
but please do n't kill me			0
" ' no one ever met the real me ' @entity0 explained her years of hiding as living like an onion			1
deep down , under various layers , or skins , she hid her female persona			0
" it is a constant , but as you suppress and as you bottle it up , it 's not like on that surface , " she told @entity46			0
" you would never notice it because i can push it so deep , but then it does kinda , like , it gnaws at you			0
so it 's always there			0
" in the film , @entity0 pulls back the curtain on her unique childhood , when she used to pretend to be sick so she could stay home from school and indulge in her secret			1
" i would put nail polish on			0
i could have , you know , a pair of my sister 's shoes on , " @entity0 said			1
" it was like a reset , it was like a vacation for me			0
so i had my vacation away from @entity121			0
" @entity0 believes she might have wanted to become a seal because they are " the toughest of the tough			1
" she thought : " i could totally make it go away if i could be at that top level			0
... maybe i could cure myself			0
" but the feeling of being born in the wrong body never went away			0
and for her entire military career , @entity0 kept her secret			1
she said virtually no one , out of the thousands of people she worked with , knew the truth -- it was so well hidden			0
" no one ever met the real me , " she said			1
' true brotherhood ' though her identity was hidden , the rest of what @entity0 offered was true			1
" i gave true brotherhood			0
i did my best , 150 % all the time , and i gave strength and honor and my full brotherhood to every military person i ever worked with			0
" @entity0 married a woman and had children			1
" i was just trying to fit in to the stereotype @entity146 , exactly what my parents and everyone expected of me , " @entity0 says in the film			1
" i met someone who 's -- who 's awesome , you know , we got along good			2
" @entity0 chose to reveal the secret to her wife slowly , to " see what the acceptance level " was			1
" she was n't totally digging it			0
so she had no idea what she was getting into			0
@entity163 was n't the top on her list of things that she wanted , so it hurt			0
" as much of mainstream @entity41 learns more about what it means to be transgender , @entity0 says even she is still trying to figure out some aspects for herself			1
" it took me a long time to get to this point where i 'm comfortable living in my own skin , " she says			0
" i 'm very comfortable living the way i 'm living right now , because it 's natural to me now , and i 've never had that			0
" what she seems sure of is , " i 'm not a gay man , i 'm not a drag queen , i am not maybe total dude , and i 'm not total feminine , i 'm not totally female , " @entity0 said			2
" i think i 'm living more in that gray world			0

@entity0 served as a @entity1 for more than 20 years
then named @entity186 , she deployed in @entity29 , @entity28 and @entity187
@entity0 *retired* in 2011 and has since come out as transgender
" no one ever met the real me , " she says
