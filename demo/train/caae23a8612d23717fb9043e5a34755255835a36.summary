-- the fate of 29 @entity3 coal miners and contractors remains a mystery more than 20 hours since they were last above ground , with rescuers awaiting word that conditions are safe to go after the trapped men			1
an explosion rocked the @entity13 mine , on @entity3 's west coast between @entity15 and @entity16 , around 4 p.m. friday @entity3 time			2
two men walked out with minor injuries , but their colleagues -- ages 17 to 62 -- were trapped as much as 2.2 kilometers ( 1.4 miles ) from the tunnel 's opening and have not been heard from since			1
for now , authorities are monitoring results from a series of tests to determine if the air - quality underground is safe enough to send in help			1
the four tests conducted thus far , focusing on carbon monoxide levels , have been " inconclusive , " said @entity32 ceo @entity31 at a saturday afternoon press conference			2
the rescuers are miners themselves , according to @entity37 , superintendent of the @entity38 , who is heading the rescue effort			1
for now , they are conducting drills and ready to go in at a moment 's notice			0
" safety is paramount for me , " said @entity37			2
" when the opportunity arises , they 'll be ready to go			0
they want to save their colleagues			0
" the miners ' families , meanwhile , are at a @entity52 hall in @entity15 , about an hour from the site , where they 're getting updates from the mine company and emergency rescue personnel			1
@entity31 said the relatives are away from the mine site , near the town of @entity60 about 90 miles northwest of @entity61 , because " it does n't add any value to the rescue operation and it does n't add value to them , either			1
" right now , they are mostly left to wait			0
" there 's 29 men down there			1
and there 's 29 families			2
and there 's 29 different sets of circumstances , " said @entity31			2
" and all of them are dealing with it in their own way			0
" the two survivors , one of whom has a brother trapped underground and whose father is the mine 's safety manager , spent friday night in a local hospital after suffering moderate blast injuries before being released saturday			1
they both have talked to authorities , who still do n't know what caused the explosion or the current condition of the mine			2
there are drinking water sources underground , said @entity31 , and the workers likely brought some food with them			0
although no contact has been made , officials are hopeful the trapped men found refuge near a ventilation shaft and might be getting fresh air from a broken compressor pipe			1
the situation in @entity3 is different from @entity106 , where rescuers successfully freed 33 men stuck underground in a copper and gold mine for 69 days			1
there are two routes out of the mine , @entity31 said			0
unlike the @entity106 mine , where 33 miners were rescued in mid-october , the @entity13 mine has steep terrain , and the shafts run horizontally into the hill , not vertically into the ground			2
" this is not @entity106			0
it 's a whole different type of mine , " said @entity37			0
still , like in @entity106 , government and rescue authorities said they 've been getting offers of help from around the region and the world			0
gas testing equipment has been flown in from @entity131 to help with the rescue operation , with engineering and health experts ready to assist			0
a facebook page devoted to the rescue effort had attracted over 9,500 supporters by saturday afternoon from people wishing the miners well , offering prayers and asking for information			0
@entity3 prime minister @entity142 , who spoke briefly at the end of saturday 's press conference , said that he 's received offers of help from many groups and people , including an e-mail from prince @entity149 that his heart went out to the miners			1
" from the government 's perspective , we 're doing everything we can to make sure these 29 brave men are taken out of the mine , " said @entity142			1
" it 's a difficult time for everyone			0
