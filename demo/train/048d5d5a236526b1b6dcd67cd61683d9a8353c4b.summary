anyone who imagines @entity2 president @entity1 and @entity4 prime minister @entity3 discussed territorial disputes with @entity6 or the @entity2 's " pivot to @entity8 " foreign policy during their private dinner in @entity11 on wednesday likely is n't familiar with the restaurant where the two leaders dined			1
ahead of a protocol - bound formal state visit that officially begins on thursday , @entity3 took @entity1 to @entity16 , the fabled restaurant in @entity11 's fashionable @entity19 district widely regarded as the best sushi restaurant in the world			1
diners approach @entity16 with a sense of reverence			0
the @entity4 food provided by head chef and proprietor @entity27 leaves little time for small talk , much less big talk			1
the focus is on the fish			0
heralded as a @entity4 national treasure , @entity27 , who turns 90 next year , is the first sushi chef in the world to receive three @entity38 stars			1
with hundreds of onlookers behind police barriers lining the streets near the restaurant , @entity1 and @entity3 , neither wearing neckties , shook hands and entered the basement restaurant			1
new @entity2 ambassador to @entity47 , @entity48 , also attended the dinner , which lasted about an hour and a half			1
like those who have gone before him into this shrine of sushi , @entity1 did not leave disappointed			1
" president @entity1 told me that , ' i was born in @entity56 and ate a lot of sushi , but this was the best sushi i 've ever had in my life , ' " @entity3 told @entity47 's @entity62 network after the meal			1
so what did @entity1 and @entity3 experience once the doors closed on their private dinner ? the following review of @entity16 , originally published by @entity69 in 2012 , might give a small taste			1
@entity72 's best sushi at @entity16 hidden in a basement attached to the @entity74 , @entity16 has vaulted into the worldwide cultural milieu thanks to the 2012 release of the @entity78 feature - length documentary " @entity79			1
" rather than simply watch the spectacular food porn that is @entity78 's doc , i went a step further , traveling directly to the source to offer the following account of chef @entity86 's legendary soft - handed , two - fingered technique that pairs fresh nigiri cuts from the @entity89 fish market with warm and delicate rice			1
here 's how the evening went			1
spoiler : i was n't disappointed			0
6:58 p.m. walking through the entrance of @entity16 , i take a deep breath , slowing my heart rate to match the tranquil environment inside			0
minutes earlier , while lost on the streets of @entity19 , i was worried about missing the seating on a three - month - old reservation and the resulting 15,000 yen ( $ 146 ) cancellation penalty			1
but i 've arrived on time , prepared to eat some sushi			1
online clamor has it that the folks at @entity107 are wary of @entity108 , some people even going so far as to assert the restaurant 's service is rude ; so i 'm extra cautious , but encounter no such attitude			1
i 'm escorted to one of 10 seats at this shrine to @entity4 sushi , offered a warm towel to clean my hands and face , a cup of tea and even a small rubber pad so that my camera does n't make direct contact with the altar - like counter top			1
7 p.m. the staff wastes no time , quickly asking if i have any dietary restrictions			0
when i answer no , chef @entity86 and his son @entity127 immediately present a menu detailing the 19 - piece " chef 's @entity129 , " followed by the first dish , karei , or sole			1
a light , flat fish , the sole is expertly glazed with soy sauce and placed atop a two - inch bed of rice			2
with a bit of hesitation , i forgo chopsticks , soy sauce and wasabi altogether for the traditional fingers - only approach and prepare to enjoy that first taste of perfection			2
7:01 p.m. the karei cleanses my palate , offering a dose of fishiness without overpowering the taste buds			0
it 's the perfect appetizer , and there 's no doubt that chef @entity86 has designed tonight 's custom menu to lead my sense of taste through a special gastronomic journey			1
7:02 p.m. next up , sumi - ika , or squid			2
its slightly rubbery texture engages my teeth to chew a bit more and spread the flavor around my mouth			0
the quality of the fish is already apparent in these first two pieces , but what 's also clear is that @entity86 's special grade of rice , made available only to him , is the unsung hero of this sushi combination			1
served at body temperature , the rice is slightly acidic , carrying a distinct flavor of vinegar , and subdues the palate to complement the explosive flavors of the fish			0
7:04 p.m. a naturally slow eater , i 'm already having trouble keeping up with @entity86 's pace , but i have faith that his speed is designed to enhance the culinary experience , and i quickly engulf his next cut , inada , or young yellowtail			2
@entity190 in flavor and lightly glazed with soy sauce , the inada is the first real " fishy fish " in the sequence			0
7:05 - 7:09 p.m. the holy trinity of sushi has arrived : @entity197 , @entity198 - toro and @entity199 ; a progression of tuna nigiri , aged up to 10 days , that transitions from the leanest to the fattiest , and ensures that i 'll never again be able to enjoy another restaurant 's raw fish in my mouth quite this much			1
while the @entity207 sets the tone , and the oo - toro rounds out the movement , it 's the @entity211 , the lightly marbleized , medium fatty tuna from the upper belly , paired with a hint of wasabi between the fish and the rice , that melts on my tongue , evaporating into a sublime and heavenly flavor as i swallow			1
7:11 p.m. @entity220 , or gizzard shad , is next , and while i 've never heard of this fish , it 's a member of the herring family and its shiny sliver and blue - spotted skin are so picturesque that i momentarily pause in awe before popping this bite in my mouth			1
7:13 p.m. the marathon continues with akagai , or ark shell clam			0
the first shellfish on the menu , the akagai carries an interesting slimy texture that 's balanced by an engaging chewiness			2
7:15 p.m. piece number nine is the tako , or octopus			2
supposedly massaged by @entity86 's apprentices for 50 minutes prior to serving , the tako is chewy , crunchy and refreshing , and served with a light salt rub			2
but please , " no soy sauce , " explain the master chef and his son , the first words they 've uttered during this entire experience			2
7:16 p.m. @entity248 , or horse mackerel , is served			0
i quickly take the aji down , followed by a small bite of pickled ginger			0
7:18 p.m. next up is kuruma - ebi , or tiger shrimp			2
a two - piece serving -- one head , one tail -- kuruma - ebi is a hearty and meaty prawn , with vibrant coloring , expertly cut to incorporate the flavor of the head , and a complete work of art. 7:19 p.m. @entity266 , or springtime halfbeak , arrives			1
while not a popular nigiri cut outside of @entity47 , it 's a beautiful specimen , a long sparkly strip of fish wrapped like a ribbon atop the rice , full of rounded ridges on one side			2
a species apparently fed upon by predatory fishes , this sayori has just become the victim of a red - blooded carnivore			2
7:20 p.m. never before have i ever seen such a magnificent clam ; the hamaguri , topped with a touch of sweet glaze , is both chewy and satisfying			0
it carries the distinct flavor of clam , but with none of the regular crunchiness found in shellfish mantle			0
7:22 p.m. piece number 14 , saba , or skinless mackerel			2
fresh , fishy , moist and succulent , the saba is another nigiri slice that melts upon consumption			0
@entity86 may not say much , and while many previous customers have mistaken his silence as contempt , the truth is that he speaks with his palms and fingers , which create a combination of fish and rice unmatched by any other			0
7:23 - 7:26 p.m. @entity127 prepares the soft - yet - crunchy seaweed outer layer for another trio of rich flavor : uni , or sea urchin , kobashira , or small scallop abductor muscle and ikura , or salmon roe			2
a bottom feeder , uni is generally something i avoid , but from the hands of chef @entity86 it becomes a creamy , rich morsel of the ocean floor			0
@entity323 and ikura are equally good , the small scallops glazed and tender , the roe larger than normal , a quick shot of salmon juice squirting out as each individual egg is popped with every chew			0
7:28 p.m. @entity331 , or saltwater eel , is the final fish in the omakase set			0
unlike any other eel i 've ever eaten , it carries a sweet kabayaki taste -- @entity127 himself once again suggests " no soy sauce			0
" 7:29 p.m. the " @entity346 " comes to a close with tamago , a sweet egg that tastes a bit like sponge cake			0
one of @entity16 's many specialties , tamago is a perfect dessert , fluffy and moist , a satisfying end to an intense 30 minutes			0
7:31 p.m. i bow slightly toward @entity86 , acknowledging his skills , and he bows back			0
all at once , i 'm whisked away to a booth behind the main sushi bar for a slice of juicy honeydew melon , served for its digestive benefits , and another cup of tea			0
7:37 p.m. while the whole experience is priceless , it 's time to put a figure on this sushi dream			1
one of @entity86 's shokunin , or " craftsmen , " then presents me with a bill for 30,000 yen ( $ 292 ) , plus tax , and kindly reminds that it 's cash only			1
significantly lighter in the wallet , i surrender			0
@entity86 has lived up to its reputation as the world 's greatest sushi restaurant , and although the price was hefty , the food was certainly worthy			1
getting there : @entity16 , @entity377 , @entity378 / f , 2 - 15 , @entity19 4 - chome , @entity379 - ku , @entity11 , @entity47 ( @entity19 @entity380 ) +81 ( 0 ) 3 3535 3600 ( reservations must be made from a @entity4 telephone number )			0
hours of operation : 11:30 a.m. -2 p.m. , 5:30 p.m. -8:30 p.m. closed on sundays , public holidays , saturday evenings , mid-august and year - end holidays .			0
