they have brought their expertise into the sports industry			0
" but @entity1 are the year 's big winners			1
despite the defeat by @entity11 and having been beaten to the @entity7 league and cup by @entity55 , the club 's brand value grew by 59 % over the last 12 months			1
" if you look at @entity1 , they are a domestic powerhouse , " said @entity37			2
" they have got really strong links with strong @entity7 brands			2
" @entity1 have long - term deals , they have been with @entity62 for over 10 years			1
they generate the highest commercial revenue and they are able to negotiate the highest possible deals based on their dominance of the @entity7 market			2
" @entity67 mourns as @entity1 blow big chance behind @entity32 and @entity1 are the @entity69 " @entity75 " rivals of @entity70 , third with a value of $ 600 million , and @entity73 , with a brand worth $ 580 million			1
@entity69 champions real and 2011 @entity23 champions @entity73 have seen similar decreases in the value of their brands , 7 % and 8 % respectively , which @entity80 puts down to the country 's current economic plight			1
" they have both had relatively successful years on the pitch , " he said			0
" the eurozone crisis has really impacted the capital in @entity69 and @entity89			2
it 's not necessarily something they are doing wrong commercially , it 's a sign of the economy they operate in			0
" the top 10 is dominated by teams from the @entity97 , with @entity32 and @entity11 followed by 2011 - 12 title winners @entity99 in eighth ( $ 302 million ) @entity100 unsure of @entity11 future " within @entity23 , the @entity97 is still the pinnacle , " explained @entity37			1
" it still generates the most money because of the broadcast rights			0
" it is much more attractive to a foreign audience than the @entity108 or the @entity109			0
the @entity97 clubs are benefiting from that			0
" @entity113 winners @entity112 ( $ 85 million ) were the only @entity114 club to increase brand value , coming off the back of a relatively successful @entity5 campaign , to be 22nd overall			2

the games are rarely sold out and the grounds themselves have quite a small capacity			0
" the commercial deals in the @entity140 can not compete with the @entity23 market			0
the @entity131 is still largely only shown in the @entity140 , it has n't really expanded globally as quickly as we would have expected			0
" with such a huge gap between the sport 's most lucrative brands and those with less commercial appeal , are football clubs making the most of their financial potential ? " i think there is more scope for all the clubs to further maximize value -- clubs have traditionally been slow and unimaginative in monetizing the brand they own , " @entity37 said			2
" there is scope for football clubs to learn from @entity140 sports marketing practices			0
" the clubs need to better understand the brand asset that they own so that they can ensure they get the right returns on all commercial deals			0
