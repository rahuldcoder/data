-- the image of @entity2 , once emblazoned across a renowned bookstore mural near the @entity5 campus , has been replaced -- a move that the artist says he 'd been waiting to make until the end of a child sexual abuse trial that 's still fresh in the minds of many			1
" i just could n't have it up there , " said @entity11 , who replaced @entity2 's picture with that of @entity14 , a @entity5 graduate , poet and advocate for sexual abuse victims			1
" it 's @entity23 , but there 's definitely a cloud over this town these days , " @entity11 said tuesday , having painted two red handprints beside @entity14 's image on sunday			1
a blue ribbon was added to the rendering a day later , two months ahead of the fall school semester and just as the drumbeat for @entity30 football begins			2
the university announced friday that it had already sold out the student section of @entity34 , with students purchasing more than 21,000 season football tickets			1
attorney : @entity2 to appeal child sex abuse convictions the team 's home opener against @entity41 is scheduled for september 1 , leaving the program with the likely distraction of a @entity2 sentence just as the first @entity46 season gets under way			1
following friday 's verdict , judge @entity48 ordered the former defensive coordinator to a county jail to await sentencing for about 90 days			2
@entity2 was convicted on 45 counts related to child sex abuse			1
he continues to maintain his innocence			0
but as @entity5 grapples with the trial 's aftermath , it still faces the related prosecution of two former university officials : vice president @entity61 and athletic director @entity62			1
" until the @entity66 and @entity62 part gets taken care of , it wo n't be over , " said @entity63 , a 27 - year - old @entity5 alumnus			0
" it 's a huge scar			2
" court proceedings involving the two ex-administrators are expected to begin in @entity71 , according to @entity72 , a spokesman for the @entity74 attorney general 's office			2
last year , the scandal led to the november firing of iconic head coach @entity77 and university president @entity78 and brought charges against @entity66 and @entity62 for perjury and failing to report the abuse			1
@entity77 -- who died on january 22 after a storied career that brought @entity5 football to national prominence -- reported to his superiors a child sex abuse incident in a university shower that involved @entity2 , but did not inform police			1
photos : @entity77 through the years " we determined that his decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow up constituted a failure of leadership by @entity77 , " the board of trustees said in a report that explained his firing			0
that decision prompted rioting by @entity5 students , overturning a news van and clashing with police , who used tear gas to break up throngs of angry protesters			0
months later , the loss of @entity77 -- often referred to as " @entity109 " -- still resonated with students when asked tuesday about the lingering effects of the scandal			0
" @entity109 was kind of an idol for everyone , " said @entity113 , 19 , a @entity5 sophomore			0
" without him there , people are going to feel differently " about the program			0
" i think the community is just trying to move on now , " he added			0
@entity11 , the muralist , recalled a conversation he had with @entity77 shortly before his death			0
@entity11 said the former head coach told him that " if he knew what he knew now , he would have done things differently			0
" " i think the one positive out of all this is that if anything like this ever happens again , people will go directly to the police , " @entity11 said			0
the @entity74 muralist added that he 'd received dozens of e-mails from survivors of sexual abuse , asking him to paint over @entity2 's picture on his mural			1
the image of the former assistant coach had been erased from the rendering in november , but was only replaced with @entity14 's picture on sunday			1
those e-mails " really made me think about the young people looking at the mural , and the young men " who had accused him of abuse , he said			2
following @entity2 's november indictment , @entity5 says it has since required all university employees to complete training on recognizing and reporting suspected child abuse , and has revised its policy on the oversight of minors on campus			1
sex abusers prey on kids ' trust , thrive on shame and fear , experts say " the @entity165 now requires two or more authorized adults must be present during activities where minors are present , " said school spokesman @entity163 in a written statement			0
the board of trustees also commissioned an independent investigation led by former fbi director @entity171 to investigate " what failures occurred and what changes we must make to ensure this does n't happen again , " the statement said			0
@entity171 's group has since interviewed more than 400 university employees			2
meanwhile , @entity179 -- one of @entity2 's six adopted children -- said through his attorney that he was also sexually abused by his adoptive father , and that he had been prepared to testify against him			1
the announcement could ultimately bring additional charges against the former coach			0
addressing reporters friday night , @entity2 's attorney said the defense had learned from prosecutors that the younger @entity2 -- who sat with his family on the first day of the trial -- could have testified as a rebuttal witness if his adoptive father had taken the stand			1
attorney @entity194 said his client , who denied sexually abusing @entity179 , " still wanted to testify , " but reluctantly agreed not to for fear that his son 's testimony " would destroy any chance of an acquittal			0
" photos : @entity2 convicted on 45 counts			2

the artist put a picture of an advocate for sexual abuse victims in place of @entity2 's
the university says the student section of @entity34 is sold out for football season
