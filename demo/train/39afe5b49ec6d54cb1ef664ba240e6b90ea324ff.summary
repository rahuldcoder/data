@entity0 -- the @entity4 has seen no unexpected moves by the @entity7 military since the announcement of @entity10 's death , the chairman of the @entity3 said monday			1
gen. @entity11 said the @entity4 is remaining " vigilant " in the wake of the death of the @entity7 leader			2
in the first extended on the record comments from a senior @entity4 official , @entity11 told a small group of reporters he was awakened overnight to receive the news and immediately joined in an inter-agency phone call of high levels officials to discuss the situation			2
@entity11 said the call centered on identifying the key military and intelligence indicators that the @entity4 would need to watch for any early warning of instability in the regime			2
though @entity10 died on saturday , @entity4 officials only learned of his death from @entity7 television on sunday night " the chain of command military and civilian very quickly coalesced around the fact that @entity10 had died , " @entity11 said			1
" we quickly established a network of leaders to discuss this issue and to determine what we could do to contribute to understanding what might happen next			0
" @entity4 defense secretary @entity43 spoke with his @entity45 counterpart , @entity44 , on monday morning , said @entity47 spokesman @entity46			1
" he made it clear that the @entity4 stands with the @entity45 in this time of uncertainty , " @entity46 said			2
" both men agree it is critical to remain prudent in regards to all matters relating to our security posture there , and pledge to keep one another informed in the coming days			0
both men agree this is a delicate time , and they need to closely monitor developments in @entity7			2
" so far there are no signs of movement of troops or weapons by the @entity7 , @entity46 said			1
this summer , the commander of @entity4 troops in @entity45 told @entity68 that the @entity4 does not believe @entity69 will differ much in decision making from his father or in adjusting the country 's strategic priorites			1
however , gen. @entity74 warned of the wildcard of having such a young , inexperienced leader			0
" @entity69 's youth and inexperience increase the likelihood of miscalculation , as does the imperative for him to establish credibility with the military hardliners he needs to support succession , " @entity74 told the @entity77 in a written answer			0
@entity11 said monday that the @entity87 has reported it has sufficient intelligence assets in the area to keep surveillance on @entity7 , but it may shift some capabilities to the peninsula from where they are currently located in the region			0
@entity4 troops in @entity45 are not on any heightened state of alert , @entity4 military officials said			1
" the commander continually assesses our security level and makes adjustments as necessary			0
but we 're operating under what 's called ' normal armistice conditions			0
' in other words , the level of readiness is as it is on any given day , " @entity103 , spokeswoman for @entity104 , told @entity1			0
@entity4 @entity109 's official website lists the current @entity111 level as " @entity112 , " with some selected measures at a more heightened " @entity115 " level			0
that means they 've stepped up patrols of bases , tightened gate security and ordered troops to pay special attention to " designated vulnerable points " both on and off base			0
but these measures were in place before @entity10 's death , along with a recent reinstatement of an overnight curfew for @entity4 troops in @entity45			1
separately , a senior @entity4 military official says the test - firing of two short - range missiles by @entity7 was expected and not considered related to the current situation			1
" there are strong indications ( the missile test ) was pre-planned , and there is no nexus to the death of the @entity7 leader , " the military official said .			1
