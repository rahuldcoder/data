@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 , or @entity4 as she 's known to her friends , is , in her words , " an obscure music teacher in @entity7 , @entity8			0
" @entity9 , whose @entity11 modules have been viewed over 7 million times but that 's not strictly true : @entity3 is far from obscure			1
through her online music courses , she has reached thousands of people and her teaching material has been viewed online -- over 7 million times			1
@entity3 is just one of a growing number of professors and teachers who are using the web site @entity11 ( cnx.org ) to reach potential students			1
and what 's more , they 're doing it for free			2
@entity11 was set up by @entity26 professor @entity25 in 1999			1
he wanted to produce learning materials for his electrical engineering students , but was frustrated by how expensive and slow it would be to produce a textbook			1
" the access was going to be limited -- it would only be available to just a few students from the @entity33 , " he told @entity2			2
" in the developing world , it would basically not be available at all			2
" and the production process is just incredibly slow			0
for example , to get @entity37 out of all of our nation 's textbooks will take a decade			0
by then , @entity37 will be reinstated as a planet , so we 'll have to put it back in			0
" so @entity25 decided to do something different			0
at the time , he was learning about @entity47 software			1
it dawned on him that its open source concepts could be adapted for education			1
" i realized that there was a better way that was enabled by information technology , where we could author textbooks as a community and make them free and open for people to use and reuse , " he explained			1
on the @entity11 web site , authors can upload bite - sized chunks of learning materials called " modules			1
" modules can be strung together to form whole courses , or " collections			2
" anyone can build a collection from any combination of modules -- so , for example , a module on @entity76 could appear in collections on literature , @entity70 history or dramatic arts			2
this building - block approach means that courses can be adapted both for personal use and by teachers who can tailor each collection for a particular curriculum , class or even an individual student			1
to ensure the quality of its content , the site supports peer - review and endorsement of modules by third parties and all material is attributed to the author			1
and once a collection is assembled , a textbook version can be printed on demand through third - party @entity100 for around $ 24 -- considerably less than the cost of most college textbooks , but still enough to pay the author a slice of the royalties			2
" a lot of the back - end that 's been handled by traditional publishers can be handled very efficiently by this new breed of information technology , " @entity25 explains			2
" so we can lower the cost for everybody , sometimes to zero for materials that are online			2
" the @entity11 formula is certainly working			1
today , the site has nearly 5,000 modules written by university professors , school teachers and other educators , and while most are in the sciences ( reflecting its roots ) the arts and humanities are growing			1
the content attracts 600,000 users a month , ranging from k - 12 children to university - level engineering students			1
fifty percent of its traffic comes from outside the @entity33 , with 30 - 40 percent coming from the developing world			1
and as the site grows , @entity25 is seeing a rise in the number of people using its modules , especially in the arts and humanities , for informal learning			1
even governments are starting to notice its potential			0
@entity11 recently obtained an @entity143 to supply @entity144 with course materials , with more partner countries in the pipeline			1
and @entity11 is crossing language barriers , too			1
while most of the site 's modules are in @entity0 , the site 's volunteer translators help meet the demand for educational materials in other languages , where translation and production of traditional textbooks is often prohibitively expensive			1
" my particular book in @entity11 is fairly popular , " @entity25 explains , " but i was translated by three volunteer engineering students in @entity161 , @entity162 and my book is far more popular in @entity164 than it is in @entity0			1
" that really gives you a sense of the global reach			0
" but perhaps its most striking benefit is the site 's ability to connect talented educators who would not have considered going the traditional publishing route , like @entity175 , with people who want to learn but do n't have access to books			1
those authors are seizing the opportunity to pass on their knowledge			0
" i do n't think any publisher of music textbooks would even have looked at my material , " @entity3 told @entity2			0
" for me to go to a publisher and say , ' hey i 'm a really good writer , you should look at my textbooks ! ' -- i do n't think that ever would have happened			0
" while she writes with her students in mind , @entity3 's work has been used by people from @entity191 to @entity192 , @entity193 to @entity194			2
she gets emails every week from teachers and students who 've found her material helpful : " your explanation of minor keys and scales saved my theory life			2
thanks , " reads one example			0
" thank you for the great explanation of perfect intervals ! it was very helpful to our class , " reads another			0
it 's this response that 's prompted her to write more for the site			2
" doing something that 's so wildly popular , it makes me feel good about myself			0
it 's a pat on the back that i 'm doing the right thing and that people appreciate it , " she told @entity2			0
@entity3 currently has 167 modules available through @entity11			2
some she can knock off in an afternoon			0
the more complex modules , with sound files , figures and diagrams , can take a couple of days to write			0
@entity3 fits this around her tutoring -- it 's what she does for fun			0
she 's also helped a friend of hers publish on the site			0
@entity25 praises her work highly			0
" she is just the tip of the iceberg of a new community of authors who are going to be able to really enrich and enliven educational material for everyone , " he told @entity2			0
and through @entity11 , they can reach an eye - poppingly wide audience			1
" they can really amplify their impact to a truly global level , " he said			0
and for @entity3 , it 's an outlet for her passion for teaching			0
" i 'm convinced that making a good education available to everyone is one of the answers to fixing all the things that are wrong with the world , " she told @entity2			0
" it 's difficult to express how exciting it is to feel that i 'm actively contributing to an effort to do that			0
" ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... can open - source online learning replace the textbook ? should we give our knowledge away for free ? share your thoughts and read others ' views in the just imagine forum			1

web site @entity11 holds free learning materials
site takes its *inspiration* from open - source @entity47 software
600,000 people use the site monthly , many from developing countries
the site lets teachers and students build and print their own tailored courses
