-- you 've heard that classic mixology before : " @entity2 went into the lobby bar to gather his thoughts and ordered a vodka martini , explaining to the barman the best way to achieve the effect of vermouth without diluting the vodka too much			1
ice in the shaker , add a slurp of vermouth , pour out the vermouth , add the vodka , shake well , strain into a chilled glass , add a slice of lemon peel , no pith			0
" immortalized on the big screen and in @entity25 's 14 @entity2 books , practically everyone knows the @entity27 superspy and his drink of choice			1
but this drink -- this @entity2 -- was written not by @entity25 , but by author and screenwriter @entity32			1
he was asked by @entity25 's estate to write a new @entity2 novel ; " solo " hit shelves this month			1
in " solo , " @entity32 took a retro approach , choosing to set his story in 1969 at the height of the @entity41			1
while there are plenty of cocktails , fast cars and alluring women , @entity32 says he wanted to take @entity2 back to his roots			1
in @entity32 's version of @entity2 , there are no gadgets , no gimmickry , no flying cars and no villain with dreams of world domination			1
in the novel , @entity2 has just turned 45 , and is now a veteran of @entity58			1
he 's sent to a @entity60 nation in the middle of a bloody civil war			2
his mission : quash the rebels and covertly help the established regime			0
while there , @entity2 is forced to go " solo " on a dangerous , self - appointed mission of revenge			1
this @entity2 is still stylish , dresses impeccably , drives a @entity71 , even knows how to whip up his own salad dressing ( the recipe is included in the novel 's only footnote ) but @entity32 's version is realistic , gritty and close to the original @entity25			1
we spoke to @entity32 about his take on the iconic character			1
fast facts : @entity32 age : 61 early life : @entity32 was born in @entity83 , @entity84			1
he grew up there and in @entity86			0
for fans of : @entity2 , spy novels , literary thrillers			1
what else he has written : 20 best - selling novels and 15 films including " @entity93 , " " @entity94 " and " @entity95			0
" special honors : he was named a commander of the @entity98 in 2005			0
fun fact : @entity32 has worked on films with three actors who portrayed @entity2 : @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			1
five questions for @entity32 @entity0 : how were you approached to write a new @entity2 novel ? @entity32 : it just came out of the blue			1
it 's not something you 're even aware you 're being considered for or discussed			2
i just got a call from my literary agent one day saying stand by for this : would you be interested in writing a new @entity2 novel ? i thought about it and said almost immediately , yes , please			1
then the process gets a bit more involved			0
you have to meet the @entity25 family and i had questions for them and they had questions for me			1
there was a kind of interview and after that i officially got the job			0
it 's something that just came right out of left field and took me completely by surprise			2
i took it very seriously but i had great fun			0
it was a wonderful thing to be asked to do			0
@entity0 : was there any difficulty in taking on an iconic character like @entity2 ? @entity32 : for some people there might be , but i had written two spy novels so i was very familiar with the demands of the genre			1
i 've written a film about @entity145			0
i wrote a six - hour miniseries about @entity147			2
so taking on a book about @entity2 , somebody that 's present in the minds of millions of other people , did n't seem as strange to me as it might have been to other writers			1
it was a challenge but it was a highly intriguing one			0
so i approached it very much in that spirit			0
i was also given a very free hand by the @entity25 family			2
if they had wanted me to write to a formula or a pastiche of @entity25 i would n't have done it			1
they really let me write in my own voice , invent my own storyline with a very hands - off , benign approach			2
so it was n't a daunting prospect , more an enticing one			0
shaken and stirred on the slopes : the greatest @entity2 scene ever made ? @entity0 : you 've written about @entity25 before , so were you already a fan of his ? @entity32 : it was more of a curiosity			1
i became quite curious about @entity25 as a certain sort of @entity179			2
he was a close acquaintance of @entity180 , a writer who i 've read every word he 's written			2
i 'm equally curious about @entity180 but the two men did n't like each other at all			0
i began to wonder why this should be and started to investigate @entity25 's personality and his particular nature , which i think in some ways is very @entity179			1
i think he wanted to die , which is what 's so odd			2
he was a misanthrope and maybe depressive			0
he was only 56 when he eventually died but he was in a hurry to get to the grave as he said himself			0
so i was very intrigued by him as a sort of case study			0
in many ways he seemed rather similar to @entity180 and it was odd that the two did n't like each other at all			0
so the @entity25 curiosity was certainly there , i had put him in as a character in my novel , " @entity93			2
" i do n't know if the @entity25 family was aware of this , but i was certainly clued up about their famous ancestor			2
@entity0 : why did you choose to set the novel in 1969 and largely in @entity209 ? @entity32 : i wanted very much to set the novel in the era of @entity2			1
the novels appeared between 1953 and 1964 and if @entity25 had looked after himself a bit better he could have conceivably written a novel in 1969			1
so it 's very much that world that @entity2 the character would know and it 's also a world of no mobile phones , the @entity41 is raging , there 's no @entity222 , computers are fairly elementary , it 's classic spying			1
i very much wanted to exploit all those echoes and illusions and textures			0
i thought i would take him to @entity209 , because i said to the @entity25 family when i met them that i wanted to write a very realistic @entity2 novel , a real spy novel about a real human being , a real spy on a real mission			1
so i thought about my own background , my own upbringing			0
i 'd been living in @entity86 in the late 1960s when the @entity86 civil war was on and it had a profound effect on me			0
i thought i 'll send @entity2 off to a nasty little war in @entity209			1
you ca n't get more down and dirty and gritty than that			0
so i paralleled the events of the novel pretty closely on the events of the @entity86 civil war			0
but in the interests of making @entity2 real and making his mission real , i did n't want to write anything with too much gimmickry or gadgetry involved , or fantastical plots or organizations wanting to take over the world			1
i wanted it to be a highly realistic novel			0
@entity0 : is there another character from literature you would like to take on ? @entity32 : when i come across a character i 'm intrigued by , i often write a short story about this character			1
i fictionalize aspects of their life			0
i wrote a short story about @entity265 , for example , because i 'm a great lover of his music			2
i wrote a short story about @entity270 for the same reason			2
in my novel , " @entity93 , " i was able to have my fictional character bump into all sorts of real people who either intrigue , infuriate or fascinate me			0
i guess i 'm quite curious about @entity277 as a character			0
i 'm not a great admirer of his novels but i 'm very curious about him as an individual			0
so it might be quite stimulating to revisit @entity277 through the filter of fiction and see what i make of him the way i 've been able to do with these other characters			0
i 'm currently writing a miniseries about @entity291 , another deeply complex , strange man but because it 's a drama i 'm able to move away from the restrictions of documentary fact and present my imagined portrait of @entity296 , which is a very fascinating prospect			2
so @entity277 , i keep reading every book that comes out about him			0
there 's obviously something about him in the same way as @entity25 that intrigued me			1
so watch this space , maybe it will happen			0
10 hotels featured in @entity2 movies			2
