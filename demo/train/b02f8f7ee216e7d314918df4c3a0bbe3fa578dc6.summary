@entity0 , @entity1 -- just before midnight wednesday , @entity1 's president declared a truce in his tumultuous nation , as well as the start of negotiations aimed at not only preventing further bloodshed but forging a lasting peace			1
the statement -- agreed upon with leaders of @entity1 's three top opposition parties -- seemingly offered a respite from the violence and acrimony that 's marred the last few weeks			1
still , there have been talks before			0
there was a breakthrough as recently as four days ago , when protesters agreed to move out of @entity0 's @entity21 and unblock downtown streets			2
then it collapsed in a bloody mess tuesday on the streets of @entity0			0
so will this attempt be any different ? one thing that has changed is the scale of the violence : authorities say at least 26 people -- protesters and police alike -- were killed in fierce clashes centered around @entity0 's @entity34 , or @entity34			2
the international outrage also has ratcheted up			0
after weeks of behind - the - scenes work and general calls for a peaceful resolution , @entity37 leaders ramped up their pressure on wednesday			2
as @entity43 president @entity42 said , " we 're going to be watching closely			2
" he and other @entity37 leaders offered pointed remarks -- and floated possible sanctions -- against @entity1 's embattled government for its part in the recent violence			1
" we hold the @entity1 government primarily responsible , " @entity42 said , " for making sure that it is dealing with peaceful protesters in an appropriate way , that the @entity1 people are able to assemble and speak freely about their interests without fear of repression			1
" if there is a truce , it was n't evident overnight wednesday in central @entity0			2
persistent explosions rattled the night sky , the apparent product of protesters ' fireworks , security forces ' stun grenades and whatever else			0
demonstrators continued to pick up pavement and rocks , then throw them at police			0
security forces themselves responded , including in some cases throwing @entity75 in protesters ' direction			0
" the government would like the world to believe that those on @entity34 are just terrorists and extremists to justify the bloodshed , ... that those on @entity34 are armed with firearms and rioting , " @entity0 protester @entity78 told @entity79			2
" but it 's not a riot ... it 's a revolution of dignity			1
" both sides appear dug in the situation began in november , when the opposition hit the streets angry about @entity96 's backpedaling from a trade pact with the @entity98			1
that move and @entity101 's offer the following month to buy $ 15 billion in @entity1 debt and slash the price @entity0 pays for its gas played into the storyline of @entity1 being a proxy for battles between @entity101 and the @entity37			1
yet this dispute goes beyond international affairs			0
it 's also about who controls @entity1 's future and how , as seen in the opposition 's pressing for constitutional reforms shifting powers from the president to the parliament			1
the government 's response to the dissent -- including a sweeping , if short - lived , anti-protest law in january -- further inflamed the opposition			1
while the protests in @entity34 have been a constant , there have been ebbs and flows in the unrest			0
the most sudden shift came on tuesday , two days after a seeming breakthrough			0
riot police plowed through the streets with water cannons , stun grenades , night sticks and , in some cases , armored personnel carriers			0
protesters fought back , with some clawing paving stones from the streets and firing @entity141 cocktails attached to fireworks from an improvised air cannon			0
they even set fire to the headquarters of the headquarters of the ruling @entity147			0
overnight tuesday , the situation had become a standoff			0
the security forces maintained on alert and so did demonstrators , refusing to budge from their physical position in the center of @entity1 's capital as well as their political positions			1
a ring of fire continued to burn along barricades around their camp in the city center			0
their cries against president @entity96 are continuing too -- accusing him of scuttling an @entity98 trade pact to cozy up with @entity101 , resisting reforms that might curb his power and stubbornly , heavy - handedly dealing with the opposition			1
as to the @entity1 government , while security forces held back wednesday , its officials did not			1
in an interview with @entity2 's @entity175 , foreign minister @entity173 said an opposition march tuesday " ended with massive riots and aggressive and excessive attacks against the @entity1 police			1
" the head of @entity1 's security service was even more forceful , accusing protesters of taking over government offices nationwide and looting 1,500 weapons and 100,000 rounds of ammunition , among other misdeeds			1
" these are concrete acts of terror , " @entity188 said in a statement announcing an anti-terrorism operation apparently targeting protesters			0
" radical and extremist groups are now a real threat			0
" @entity188 spoke hours before the announcement of the truce , which two of the opposition leaders -- @entity200 and @entity201 -- later confirmed			1
@entity200 , a former world - class boxer who now leads the @entity202 , said the next round of talks will take place thursday			0
until then , @entity96 has promised that there will be no further attempts to disperse protesters in @entity34 , according to a statement on @entity200 's party 's website			2
" today , a key goal is to stop the bloodshed that authorities have provoked and unleashed , " @entity200 said			0
" now we will see how @entity96 will stick to his word after promised sanctions from the @entity37			1
" @entity1 's top military man replaced one man who wo n't be part of the government 's anti-terrorism campaign is @entity1 's armed forces chief			1
col. gen. @entity224 has been replaced , according to a statement wednesday on the president 's website			1
no reason was given for the dismissal of @entity224 , who according to his official bio started in the @entity233 military , then rose through the ranks of @entity1 's military before getting the top job in february 2012			1
@entity43 general @entity237 , the military commander for @entity239 -- the 23 - nation alliance including not just @entity241 and the @entity43 , but @entity1 's neighbors @entity243 and @entity244 -- called " upon the new military leadership in @entity1 to open a dialog ( sic ) with us to bring this situation to a peaceful resolution			1
" in his @entity2 interview wednesday , @entity1 's foreign minister insisted that -- despite what he characterized as protesters ' provocations -- police have " strong instructions " to avoid using " offensive means			1
" and @entity173 rejected reports that the army , whoever leads it , has been authorized to fire on protesters			0
" under no conditions ( will ) the @entity1 army ... be used in resolving this political crisis , " the minister added			1
over the course of a few hours overnight wednesday , @entity1 troops moved into defensive positions around bases and weapons depots , according to a @entity43 defense official familiar with the latest intelligence			2
the move is seen by the @entity43 as an effort to ensure the military 's facilities remain secure			2
@entity43 wo n't issue visas to 20 @entity1 after some well - reported infighting about how engaged they 'd been in the crisis , @entity37 officials were vocal on wednesday not just condemning the violence but threatening action			2
the foreign ministers of @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity243 are set to to travel to @entity0 on thursday to survey the situation , before briefing their @entity98 colleagues in @entity288			0
after that , they and their @entity43 allies could impose sanctions against @entity96 's government -- especially if there is even more violence			2
@entity296 president @entity295 vowed @entity300 officials will " respond to the any deterioration on the ground " with " targeted measures against those responsible for violence and use of excessive force			2
" @entity43 secretary of state @entity306 said that @entity96 must decide " between protecting the people that he serves -- all of the people -- ... versus violence and mayhem			0
" " we are talking about the possibility of sanctions or other steps with our friends ( in ) @entity241 and elsewhere in order to create the environment for compromise , " @entity306 said			0
later wednesday , a senior @entity323 official told reporters that the @entity43 would n't issue visas for 20 senior members of the @entity1 government and others responsible for tuesday 's violent crackdown on protesters			1
calling the violence from both government forces and protesters " completely unacceptable , " @entity332 prime minister @entity331 challenged @entity1 's leaders to make the public 's safety their first priority			1
" president @entity96 has a particular responsibility to pull back government forces and de-escalate the situation , " @entity331 said			0
such measures could affect individuals but not likely the larger situation short term , said @entity347 , president of the @entity348			0
military action seems highly unlikely , and @entity101 appears poised to help @entity1 's government if economic sanctions were imposed , he said			1
" we really do n't have very good options to introduce , " @entity347 told @entity2			0
@entity79 : protester describing bloodied people being rushed to medics @entity2 's @entity357 and @entity358 reported from @entity0 , while @entity2 's @entity359 reported and wrote from @entity360			2
@entity2 's @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 and @entity372 contributed to this report .			0
