-- @entity3 government forces have seized control of a central town from an @entity9 - linked @entity8 militia , a spokesman for @entity3 's president said thursday			1
secretary of state @entity10 has offered aid to @entity12 , @entity3 's president			2
" @entity15 is now under the control of government forces after our forces overran a stiff resistance at the entrance bridge of the town by @entity23 fighters , " said @entity13 , communication director for @entity12 , @entity3 's transitional president			1
despite the announcement , residents said heavy fighting continued thursday and the town is still divided between pro-government forces and @entity23 fighters			1
the ongoing exchange of heavy - weapon fire between the two sides has trapped people in the town , residents said			0
" everyone inside this house is scared because heavy shells are raining in the town , " said one resident , @entity36			0
@entity15 is about 155 miles ( 250 kilometers ) southeast of the @entity3 capital of @entity42			0
the @entity43 is supporting the @entity3 government 's fight against the insurgents , including providing weapons to government forces			1
@entity23 is on the @entity43 list of terror organizations because of its ties to @entity53 's @entity9 network			1
the @entity43 is concerned that @entity3 's weak government could fall to the @entity8 insurgency , as it did in 2006 before @entity57 forces ousted the militants from power later that year			1
earlier this month , @entity43 secretary of state @entity10 met with @entity3 's transitional president and vowed to continue @entity43 support for his government			1
" the @entity43 and the international community must serve as an active partner in helping the @entity72 [ transitional federal government ] and the people of @entity3 confront and ultimately move beyond the conflict and poverty that have gripped their country , " @entity65 said at a joint news conference with @entity12 at the @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69			2
the @entity43 announced in june that it is providing weapons and ammunition to help @entity12 's government fight the militants			2
the weapons shipments are in accordance with @entity86 resolutions , which ban some arms shipments to @entity3 , said @entity89 spokesman @entity88			0
@entity65 warned that terrorist groups like @entity23 pose a threat to the broader international community			0
" certainly if @entity23 were to obtain a haven in @entity3 , which could then attract @entity9 and other terrorist actors , it would be a threat to the @entity43 , " she said			1
there are growing concerns that @entity3 could be the next base for @entity9 as @entity43 forces pound their positions in @entity103 and @entity104			1
cia director @entity105 recently said that the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing @entity9 operatives			2
" our concern right now is that likely safe havens are areas in the @entity115 , like @entity3 and @entity116 , that are countries that because of their political status can be attractive to @entity9 in order to operate there , " @entity105 said in june			2
separately , the @entity122 is investigating what appears to be a massive recruiting effort by @entity23 in immigrant communities in the @entity43			0
more than a dozen young men of @entity3 descent have disappeared from the @entity128 , @entity129 , area in recent months			0
at least three of them , including a suicide bomber , have been killed in @entity3			0
also , @entity133 recently announced the arrests of four men with ties to @entity23 who were suspected of planning a suicide attack on a military base in the southern state of @entity141			0
president @entity12 is a former member of the @entity142 , which took part in the 2006 coup			0
his decision to renounce the bloody insurgency and try to establish peace in @entity3 has put him at odds with @entity8 hard - liners who are still battling for control of @entity3			2
it also paved the way for his election as president of @entity3 's @entity86 - backed transitional government in january			1
