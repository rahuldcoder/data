-- too lazy to have a shower ? worry no more , there 's a lotion for that			0
@entity5 is a germ - killing gel that allows you to take a bath without using a single drop of water or soap -- all you need is to apply the gel on your skin and then vigorously rub it off using your hands			1
" the special formula will cover the whole body with the cleansing gel , which will use the vigorous rubbing to lift the dirt off the skin , " explains @entity15 , the inventor of @entity5 and founder of @entity17			1
the 23 - year - old entrepreneur came up with his revolutionary idea back in 2007 , during a hot winter day when he was relaxing with some friends under the blazing sun in @entity29 , northern @entity30			2
" man , why does n't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and you do n't have to bathe , " quipped one of his pals , complaining that he did n't feel like having a shower -- and this got @entity15 thinking			1
still in high school , @entity15 immediately took to @entity40 and @entity41 to start researching creams and lotions , learning everything about their components and how they are produced			0
since he did n't have a computer he carried out his investigations using his mobile phone and a few months later he 'd devised his own special formula -- at the age of 17 , @entity15 became @entity30 's youngest patent - filer			2
@entity15 , who won the global student entrepreneur award in 2011 , went on to study at the @entity54 and soon got his @entity5 - producing business running			1
he says his trademarked invention can be a " precious tool " for the millions of people lacking access to clean water and sanitation , as well as an an attractive option for corporate groups -- from airlines and hotels to gyms and even aid agencies -- who want to encourage their clients and users to save water			1
@entity0 's @entity72 caught up with @entity15 to speak about @entity73 , his plans for the future and why he does n't shower on the last weekend of september every year			0
@entity0 : how would you describe @entity5 to someone who 's never used it before ? @entity15 : @entity5 is a bath - substituting gel , designed to replace the need for soap , water and skin lotion			1
@entity5 provides its users with a fun and convenient alternative to traditional bathing and showering , a precious tool for helping people to lower the excessive water use that is leading to a looming global water crisis			1
@entity0 : what are @entity5 's ingredients ? @entity93 : it is a proprietary blend of cleansers and moisturizers that make it a uniquely viscous blend of bioflavonoids , natural emollients , and fruit acids to cleanse the skin , while preventing dryness , irritation and body odor			2
@entity0 : can you talk about your company 's social goals ? @entity93 : as it stands , there are almost two billion people in the world without adequate access to water and sanitation , all while people in urban societies consume an average of 80 liters of water every time they bathe / shower			2
it is our goal for @entity5 , and other products like it , to change the way society practices personal hygiene , and to provide cheap personal hygiene alternatives to the poor			0
we know we can not do this on our own , and we request any and all help that anyone can provide			0
the easiest way to provide assistance to our cause is by participating in our annual " @entity136 " -- this is our strategy to allow the public to participate in helping us skip one million or more bathes / showers by skipping them for a whole weekend in september			0
@entity0 : what are the challenges you 've faced so far ? @entity93 : the challenge our business has been facing in recent years is pricing ; we have constantly been struggling to produce and distribute the product at prices that are affordable for people in water - insecure communities -- ideally less than $ 0.10 per bathe			2
as a startup , we have had to create a parallel product ( @entity154 ) for the urban market -- campers / hikers , parents with kids , shared / public - shower users , etc. -- that can be sold at a reasonable margin to allow us to make the original @entity5 product affordable			1
@entity0 : which entrepreneurs do you most admire ? and what advice would you give to those aspiring to start their own business ? @entity93 : i admire the everyday entrepreneurs -- those who sell fruits from their stall at the corner , have a great barbershop / salon , use their car as a taxi cab , etc. they do n't do it for any glory or adoration , they just wake up every day to get the job done while still dealing with the risk of not breaking even each month			0
i urge all aspiring entrepreneurs to have this approach to business , because it 's what every great business -- big or small -- succeeds on			0
