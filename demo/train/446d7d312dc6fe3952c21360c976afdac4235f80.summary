@entity1 , @entity0 -- for years , @entity3 and @entity4 did all they could to support @entity6 , raising tens of thousands of dollars for the cancer charity founded by cyclist @entity8			1
" it all started when @entity8 's first book came out , " @entity9 said , referring to the 2001 publication of " it 's @entity12 : my @entity15 , " which details @entity8 's bout with testicular cancer			1
" i read it cover to cover			2
i was just so taken by who he said he was			2
" the @entity21 , who live in @entity22 , @entity23 , say they initially gave $ 50,000 to the foundation			2
in 2003 , @entity9 said , she helped organize an event for the foundation at a health club that raised an additional $ 150,000			0
now they want their money back			0
" i feel we were really fooled			0
we were really hoodwinked , " she said			0
their concern comes in the wake of last week 's finding by the @entity36 of " overwhelming " evidence that @entity8 was involved as a professional cyclist in " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program			1
" doping scandal costs @entity8 sponsors , charity role @entity8 stepped down as chairman of @entity6 this week and has lost endorsement deals with @entity45 and @entity46			1
the seven - time @entity48 winner , who never failed a drug test , has consistently denied the allegations			0
@entity8 has not addressed the findings but has instead urged his supporters to continue fighting cancer			1
" the mission absolutely must go on , " he said friday night at the organization 's 15th anniversary celebration in @entity1 , @entity0			1
" we will not be deterred			0
we will move forward , and we will continue to serve the 28 million people around the world that need us the most			1
" the sport 's governing body , the @entity61 , has said it will respond monday to the doping dossier compiled by the @entity36 amid calls for @entity8 to be stripped of his seven @entity48 titles			1
the @entity66 also is reviewing the evidence and could revoke @entity8 's bronze medal from the @entity69			1
but @entity71 bank @entity70 was not awaiting any further review			1
it announced friday that , after 17 years of sponsoring professional cycling teams , it will end its program at the end of the year			1
@entity71 bank pulls out as pro cycling sponsor " it is with pain in our heart , but for the bank this is an inevitable decision , " said @entity78 of @entity70 's managing board			1
" we are no longer convinced that the international professional world of cycling can make this a clean and fair sport			1
we are not confident that this will change for the better in the foreseeable future			0
" @entity70 said it had previously seen elite cycling as a good fit with the company , its clients and its employees			1
but that has changed since the @entity36 report alleging doping by @entity8 and others			1
its decision drew a sharp response on @entity105 from @entity107 cyclist @entity106 , who rides for the @entity109 team : " @entity70 , you were part of the problem			1
how dare you walk away from your young clean guys who are part of the solution			0
" the bank 's decision was a blow to the @entity70 cycling team , according to its general manager , @entity117			1
but other sponsors are sticking by the team , which will try to rebuild under a new name , he said			0
" this industry can only survive with big international firms , and the way the sponsors now are responding to this situation is certainly not good , " @entity117 said			0
" if we want to stay in cycling and grow cycling on the world scale , then something has to be done			2
" @entity6 bracelet : to wear or not to wear ? but criticism poured in from some of the charity 's donors			2
former @entity6 donor @entity137 of @entity138 is among them			0
" the charity was established and publicized and got their funds based on a fraud , " he said			0
@entity137 said he was attracted to the organization after his wife -- an avid cyclist -- was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998 , about the time @entity8 won his first @entity48 title			1
" she found his story very inspiring , " he said			0
" before we read his book , she would work all day , go to radiation treatments and go riding because that made her feel good			0
" in 2007 , the couple " became part of the public face of the foundation , " said @entity137 , a software engineer			2
" i was one of the people who would answer questions from people to raise money			0
" though he had long been aware of @entity8 's alleged drug use , he said he did n't believe it			1
" i was a huge @entity8 fan from 1999 to the time he retired ; i would defend him from anyone			1
" evidence of @entity8 doping ' overwhelming , ' agency says but , as his involvement with @entity6 grew , " i started to ask what are they doing with all this money they are raising ? " the foundation 's @entity174 filing last year reported more than $ 100 million in net assets or fund balances			1
the organization spent $ 2.1 million in compensation to its seven highest - paid officers and three employees , according to the @entity174 form			0
no member of the board , whose members include @entity2 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity187 , was compensated , it said			0
now , @entity137 said , he feels disillusioned			0
" the whole thing is founded on a lie			0
the guy cheated , and he forced other people to cheat			0
i would like my money back			0
we donated under false pretenses			0
" @entity6 spokeswoman @entity195 responded saturday by reassuring donors that the charity has always been dedicated to the highest standards of the nonprofit world			0
" they chose to support not a single person , but a cause that benefits millions of people throughout the @entity204 and throughout the world , " @entity195 told @entity2			0
" they put their trust in @entity6 , one of @entity204 's top - rated cancer charities , and we can assure them that their trust was not misplaced			1
" @entity195 said 82 % of funds raised by the @entity6 , the charity 's official name , are devoted to programs and services that benefit survivors and their families			2
@entity6 has actually seen an increase in donations and purchases from the its online store in recent weeks , @entity195 said			0
purchases from the store , which sells @entity6 's trademark yellow wristbands , sports apparel and accessories , have doubled in the past three days , she said			2
" it 's something the foundation is incredibly grateful for , and we take that as a sign that people , even in troubled economic times , value the free services that @entity6 provides cancer survivors and their families			1
" @entity235 of @entity236 , @entity237 , said he is unfazed by the @entity8 controversy			1
the 65 - year - old throat cancer survivor he has no plans to remove the yellow bracelet that identifies him as a donor to the foundation			2
highlights of the @entity8 report " if @entity8 doped , that certainly takes away from his athletic wins , " @entity235 said			1
" however , to survive what he did and come back at all is impressive			0
to come back and create good like he did with @entity6 is even better			0
" actor @entity248 expressed a similar view on friday night , as he entered the @entity250 for the anniversary event			0
" of course he remains an inspiration , " @entity248 said in response to a reporter 's question			2
" i think anybody who 's looking with a very clear eye at this would find themselves very hypocritical to consider otherwise			2
" the editor - in - chief of @entity261 , @entity260 , told @entity262 that he thinks the scandal would have an effect in the short term but that people should understand that cycling has already made moves to clean up its act			2
" the next year or two will be difficult and pivotal years for the sport			1
people need to understand that the sport is way cleaner than it used to be -- far cleaner and more transparent than most other elite sports , " he said			2
with @entity8 's disgrace , will anything change ? @entity2 's @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 , and @entity281 's @entity280 contributed to this report .			1
