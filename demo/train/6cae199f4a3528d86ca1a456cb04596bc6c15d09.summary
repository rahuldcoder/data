-- being the leader and second - richest person in one of the most beautiful and cultured nations on @entity5 might sound cushy , but prime minister @entity6 is having a rough year			1
already the subject of intense criticism over his personal life and management style , @entity6 took another blow sunday when a man police are calling " mentally unstable " smacked the @entity14 prime minister in the face with a souvenir replica of a cathedral			1
@entity6 , 73 , who was in his hometown of @entity19 stumping for a political ally , suffered broken teeth and a fractured nose			1
his alleged assailant , @entity23 , is being held by @entity25 authorities , who believe he acted alone			0
as he has done in the past after nonphysical attacks , @entity6 blamed political opponents			1
" what i can tell you is that there has been such a buildup of hatred toward the premier , and this is not good , " @entity6 spokesman @entity29 said			1
" this campaign of hatred has been building quite rapidly recently , and i am not surprised that what happened tonight took place			1
" the prime minister scores highly in polls gauging @entity14 popular opinion , though he has been tried on various charges 17 times since taking office in 1994			2
the charges include corruption , false accounting and tax fraud			0
@entity6 has said he did nothing wrong and accused magistrates of conducting a witch hunt			2
he also noted that he has never been convicted			0
in some cases , he was found guilty but won on appeal			0
@entity6 was elected to his third term as premier in april 2008 , about two months after his trial on corruption charges was postponed until after the election			2
his ability to maneuver through political crises has prompted a prominent journalist to liken him to a puppeteer , saying he is popular because he 's a skilled populist			0
@entity6 is " a man who pulls the most elementary strings of the public opinion -- a public opinion , which in @entity14 in these times , prefers simple paths , " said @entity70 , chairman of @entity71 , @entity14 's leading news wire			1
even by @entity6 's standards , 2009 has been a tumultuous year , as his second wife has filed for divorce and allegations of corruption and infidelity continue to surface			1
this month 's @entity80 @entity14 cheekily declared him " @entity81			1
" editor @entity82 released a statement saying the prime minister made rockers @entity85 and @entity87 look like " schoolboys			1
" " this year the choice was unanimous for his obvious merits due to a lifestyle for which the words , rock ' n ' roll , fall short , " @entity82 's statement said			0
watch how @entity6 was hit at a rally the prime minister 's second wife , @entity97 , whom he married in 1990 , filed for divorce in may after news reports that he attended a birthday party for 18 - year - old @entity103 model @entity102 , with whom he was accused of having an improper relationship			2
@entity6 called the allegations " slander " and the girl 's family , longtime friends of the prime minister , also deny there was anything improper			2
@entity97 , the mother of three of @entity6 's five children , is asking for about $ 70 million a year from the prime minister , whom @entity116 ranked this year as no. 70 on its list of richest people , with an estimated net worth of $ 6.5 billion			2
more allegations followed the divorce filing , including claims that women were paid to attend parties at the prime minister 's various homes			0
@entity6 denied those allegations , telling the @entity14 magazine " chi " he would never pay for sex because it would dampen the " the pleasure of the conquest			1
" in june , he went to court to block the publication of hundreds of photos from his seaside villa in @entity137 , saying they posed " an aggressive intrusion into my private life			0
" a @entity142 paper ran some of the photos , showing scantily clad women at @entity6 's villa and reporting that the premier was the subject of an investigation into whether he used official @entity14 aircraft to ferry guests to his villa			1
@entity6 admitted using government airplanes to ferry guests , but an investigation found no wrongdoing on the premier 's part			2
in october , old allegations of political scandal re-emerged when @entity14 's @entity160 overturned a law that shielded presidents , prime ministers and the leaders of both houses of parliament from prosecution			1
the court said the constitution requires all @entity14 to be equal before the law			2
@entity6 had pushed for the immunity law after his 2008 re-election , and the court 's action opened @entity6 to prosecution on allegations that he paid @entity178 tax attorney @entity177 $ 600,000 to provide false testimony in two court cases in the 1990s			1
@entity181 was convicted , but is appealing			0
the @entity160 's ruling also lifted @entity6 's immunity from prosecution on charges that his company , @entity186 , failed to pay $ 45 million in taxes between 2000 and 2003			1
the latter case was postponed until january because the prime minister was unable to attend hearings , but @entity6 has been outspoken in his defense against all of the allegations			0
he said he believes he is on trial for political reasons and has called magistrates " communist bullies			0
" he also has declared himself the most persecuted man " in the entire history of the world			0
" the @entity14 leader has often blamed @entity14 's ills on the left wing			1
he does n't enjoy leading the country , he said , " because very often there is a lot of dirty dealing			0
" he leads out of a sense of sacrifice and duty and because he is the " only leader able to hold the center - right together , " he has told @entity0			0
but @entity6 seems aware that his popularity and populism allow him to continue to hold sway in this nation of about 58 million			0
though his popularity recently has seen a slight dip among women , he routinely garners approval ratings of 50 percent or higher			0
" when i go around , it 's embarrassing to see the affection showered upon me , " @entity6 told @entity0 in october			2
" i know that people can change their opinions ... but i must say that i just note the fact that i am close to the heart of many @entity14 and they show this to me very often			0
