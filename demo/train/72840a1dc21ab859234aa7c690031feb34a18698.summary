-- a few decades ago , in the very early stages of one of the most volatile presidential campaigns in @entity7 history , @entity2 's father was seen as the man to beat for the @entity10 nomination			1
as it turned out , his candidacy did not even last until the first of the 1968 primaries			2
he was done in by his unscripted outspokenness - a trait not generally attributed to his more cautious son , whose first run for the @entity18 in 2008 survived through @entity19 tuesday			1
and who , until recently , was front - runner in this year 's @entity10 sweepstakes			2
ten years after his presidential foray , i interviewed @entity24 over a lunch of grilled cheese and chocolate milk at his suburban @entity29 home			1
he squeezed me in between a morning round of golf and his afternoon tennis match			2
at 70 , he was retired from politics but still keeping the whirlwind schedule of a campaigner , preaching citizen activism and the @entity38 religion from @entity39 to @entity40			2
reflecting on his 1968 campaign experience , he said : " if i had been elected president , i would have undertaken to do things that would have been so opposed by the special interests that they would have chopped me into little pieces			2
" like father , like son -- in business like his son years later , @entity24 first made his bones in the business world , leading fledgling @entity53 in the 1950s war on the " gas - guzzling dinosaurs " offered by @entity29 's " @entity56			1
" @entity53 introduced less profitable but more affordable compact cars to a welcoming marketplace			2
he entered politics in the 1960s , coordinating a classic grass - roots citizen drive to adopt a state constitution in @entity39 , became a civil rights activist and was elected governor			2
in nearly six years in office , he enacted the state 's first income tax against the strident opposition of many in his own party and tussled with president @entity71 , a @entity72 who saw him as a potential 1968 re-election challenger , over sending federal troops to help end @entity29 's bloody 1967 race riot that left 43 dead			2
he also toured @entity76 for 31 days in 1965 with a group of his fellow governors at a time that @entity7 still largely supported @entity7 involvement in the @entity81 country			2
it 's what he said when asked some two years later why he had changed his position on the war that doomed his presidential aspirations			2
" when i came back from @entity76 , i just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody could get , " he told @entity88 interviewer @entity87 in august 1967			2
" not only by the generals but the diplomatic corps over there			2
they do a very thorough job			0
" an early backer of the @entity7 efforts " to reverse a shift in the balance of power " between communist @entity104 and democratic @entity76 , @entity2 said the additional research he did on his return convinced him -- well before many of his countrymen -- that it was the wrong war at the wrong time			1
" i think it 's tragic we got involved in the conflict there , " he told @entity87			0
" ... the @entity110 is a farce , so somebody had to speak up and it turned out to be me			0
" ' @entity112 ' doomed presidential chances it was the " brainwash " line that caught fire and did him in			0
as he told me in the interview years later , " it was a good example of being right too soon on a political issue			0
" by the time the controversy exploded , @entity2 already had lost his very early lead in the polls to @entity124			1
by the time he dropped out , just before the @entity126 primary , he was hopelessly behind			0
that was the first in a series of dramatic political developments that year - @entity71 jarred the nation by announcing he would not seek re-election , the man whose candidacy he most feared , @entity133 , was assassinated on the night he won the @entity136 primary , riots rocked the @entity138 convention in @entity139 and @entity124 was elected president over eventual @entity138 nominee @entity141			0
@entity2 later became @entity124 's @entity143 secretary , but left that post because of his inability to get @entity18 support for urban initiatives he wanted to launch , blaming the political climate of the times			1
" @entity124 was a crook , but he was no dummy , " @entity2 told me -- another example of his often stunning candor even in the context of that era			1
he remained a media darling for years after that			0
every time he paid a courtesy call on @entity39 's state @entity159 in @entity161 when i was working as a reporter there in the 1970s , the entire press corps would scramble for a quick headline			0
" it was just all so natural for him , " said @entity165 , who worked on @entity2 's campaigns for governor , became an influential state @entity10 operative and served as state labor director and then commerce director under @entity2 's successor as governor , @entity171			1
" when @entity24 walked into a room , that room was his			1
" ' he stood up and took responsibility ' and when he took a position , no matter how controversial , he stuck with it , @entity165 said in a recent telephone interview			0
" he came out in support of an income tax ... he was one of the leading advocates , " he said			0
" he took on his own party			0
and the party had to make some adjustments			0
there were no oaths , no signed statements , no read my lips			0
he stood up and took responsibility for leading the charge			0
" comparing father and son , @entity165 said : " i watch @entity2 pander to the tea party -- i 'm sorry , there 's no other way i can describe it			1
in 1962 , at his first ( state ) convention as leader of the party , @entity24 faced the same situation with the @entity208 , and he took ' em face on			1
he did n't try to find an accommodation , and went on and beat ' em. " but that was @entity24			1
he knew who he was			0
it was a very different time , but that was @entity24			1
" he helped craft a new model of education in the urban area			0
his son did the same thing with health care			1
he did n't invent government			0
he just made it work , " @entity165 said			1
" stop apologizing for what you 've done			0
" @entity225 , editor of @entity226 , an online newsletter , was research director for the state @entity10 while @entity2 was governor , and later became a state lawmaker , a director of state agencies and @entity7 deputy assistant secretary of @entity233			1
" the contrast between the personalities of @entity2 and @entity24 is pretty pronounced , " he told me			1
" though both fairly forceful , dynamic characters , @entity2 , quite frankly , is the plastic man			1
" he looks like his father in many respects but the directness and openness of @entity24 simply is not there			1
you get the feeling everything is calculated , beyond his changing positions on the issues			0
it 's like everything he says -- it just does n't have the veracity , the ring of candor that you got from his father			2
" ' my dad was the real deal ' asked for reaction to the comments of @entity165 and @entity225 , a spokeswoman for the @entity2 campaign directed me to @entity260 , who served as @entity24 's legal counsel when he was governor , but he could not be reached			1
@entity24 , whose wife @entity262 ran unsuccessfully for the @entity263 after his departure from politics , died in 1995			1
he 's still remembered with obvious affection by those who knew him well			0
" he was a character , " @entity225 said			0
" he had a reputation before he was even elected governor			0
he was the guy who talked about gas - guzzling dinosaurs and was on the cover of @entity272			0
you talk about somebody who 's prescient , and rather prudent - here 's a guy who was talking about green energy years before it was any kind of issue			0
" both @entity225 and @entity165 called my attention to a recent @entity283 account of @entity2 's encounter in @entity126 with an 83 - year - old @entity286 immigrant who pulled out her autograph book and showed him the autograph she had gotten from his father			1
" my dad was the real deal , " @entity2 told her			1
later the woman told reporters she liked @entity2 , too			1
" i liked his smile			0
he came through human - like , " she said			0
of the relationship @entity2 had with his father , @entity165 said , " he worshipped the ground he walked on			1

@entity24 was outspoken , a trait not generally attributed to his son , @entity2
father and son both made their bones in the business world
he looks like his father , but the directness and openness is not there , former lawmaker says
