-- @entity1 hosts a sporting event over the next fortnight that manages to combine every conceivable stereotype associated with the nation -- rain , royalty and heroic @entity9 failure			2
@entity10 follows the @entity11 -- when @entity9 , with @entity12 in hand , stood in the pouring rain as the monarch cruised past in a barge on the @entity18 -- and a day after the exit of @entity21 's soccer team from a major international tournament -- as so often before on penalties -- after defeat by @entity25 in @entity26			1
since its inception in 1877 the @entity27 in a small , affluent suburb of south west @entity29 that gives the event its name , has presided over a tournament -- the oldest and grandest on the tennis circuit -- that has become more than simply another fixture on the grand slam calender			1
royal regulations for @entity39 's fashionistas the quaint images and traditions of @entity51 -- of regimented ball boys , pots of strawberries and cream , lines of well - mannered fans politely queuing for their tickets , players bowing or curtsying if the @entity41 is attendance in the @entity43 -- have become as ubiquitous as the tennis			2
overseas players like @entity56 can not get enough of the tournament 's history			1
" the great thing about @entity10 that i really appreciate is the tradition that is respected and protected for more than 130 years , " defending men 's champion @entity56 declared yesterday on his @entity60 page			1
" we still wear only white clothes during the tournament , and the defending champion always plays at 1pm on monday ! " and for the millions of people that will watch @entity10 around the world -- and it is estimated that that the global tv audience could be as high as 500 million -- the tournament also reinforces what many think constitutes @entity75			1
" it has a @entity82 - ish propriety ( in that ) it conforms to standards of behavior that were accepted ... at least during @entity82 's time ( in the 1950s , ) " explains professor @entity76 , an academic and social commentator whose most recent work looks at whether @entity1 is losing the civility that it is famous for			0
" they still refer to ' ladies ' and the scoreboard [ until recently ] reads initials rather than @entity91 ( first ) names ; the players have to wear white , and the match referee , not umpire , wears his club blazer			0
" so , there is an old - school sort of @entity75 ... and we should n't forget the time - honored convention that @entity100 never win			1
well , not since 1977 , and not in the foreseeable future			0
" @entity102 since that victory for @entity104 35 years ago -- and you have to go back to 1936 and @entity106 to find a @entity9 men 's singles champion -- the story of @entity10 has been one of sporting failure for its hosts			1
yet the power of the @entity10 brand to shape what the rest of the world thinks of @entity1 remains			1
" @entity10 is a global brand : it 's internationally recognized in a way that the @entity118 and the @entity119 yearn for , " explains @entity76			1
" in terms of reach , @entity10 runs the ( @entity21 ) @entity122 a very close second			1
the name itself resounds like a thunderclap			0
there is nowhere on earth where you can just say ' @entity10 ' and people wo n't know what you 're talking about			1
" it 's like the @entity133 : an emblem of @entity1 that commands respect and admiration near and far			0
" but emblems are not necessarily accurate reflections of reality			0
they are representations , images or symbols of an ideal ; a perfect place where people wear straw hats , eat fresh strawberries with their champagne and hobnob with the royal family			0
" for social commentators like @entity151 -- author of the famous " @entity152 " -- @entity10 represents a type of @entity75 that does n't exist any more : one steeped in glorious @entity155 that is overwhelmingly white , affluent and still centered around @entity29 and the south east of @entity21			1
" @entity10 mildly confirms that tennis around the world is quite a polite middle class game played in a very restrained way with a very restrained audience			1
people do n't get into any fervor			0
that 's for other proletarian sports , " he says			0
" it 's a middle class sport wherever you go ... it 's all nice enough ( and ) reinforces @entity9 imagery but not create it			0
it 's definitely a very southern ( @entity9 ) thing , a very southern suburb			0
it 's a southern , well off , late @entity174 suburb with a particular social character			0
" @entity76 agrees that @entity10 reflects only a very tiny aspect of @entity9 society , and one that still fails to reflect the changing multicultural character of the country that surrounds it			1
" ( @entity10 represents ) only one of many types of @entity75 , " he says			1
" football , boxing and athletics represent another type of @entity75 , one in which the competitors are black , @entity189 as well as white , and who come from all kinds of class backgrounds			1
" if @entity10 is going to be derided , it 's because it seems remote and insulated from this type of @entity75			1
" the last great @entity9 hope ? whether @entity1 itself survives the next few years is another question entirely			0
this year the hopes of the host nation once again rest on @entity201 's shoulders			0
he will also represent @entity1 at this summer 's @entity202			0
yet @entity201 is also @entity203 and @entity203 will be voting on the issue of independence in the summer of 2014			0
the country 's one viable hope for victory in the foreseeable future might be playing under a different flag in 2015			2
such is the confusion over national identity -- a debate centered on the conflict between @entity9 identity and that of its constituent @entity21 , @entity216 , @entity203 and @entity218 nations , not to mention the influences of cultures from outside the realm -- that prime minister @entity222 has spoken about the need to be more muscular in promoting an idea of what @entity75 actually is			1
this year he has plenty of opportunities to do that following the @entity11 , now @entity10 and next month at the @entity202			2
but perhaps as the poet and author @entity230 recently said : " i do n't know what it means to be @entity9 and i think it 's a very positive thing			0
" @entity1 is the right sort of template for the 21st century in that it is a multinational state that is n't at war with itself , that is n't tearing itself apart , and is actually showing the world how to function			2
" in that version of @entity1 , there 's plenty of space for an event like @entity10			2
" @entity10 still maintains its specialness , " agrees @entity76			2
" there is no longer a single , unified conception of @entity75 that 's good for all times			2
" @entity10 embodies one image			2
it is nobody 's idea of all - things - @entity9			0

@entity10 is the oldest tennis tournament in the world
it began in 1877 ; defending champion @entity56 hails its " tradition "
the tournament is a powerful brand *exporting* one aspect of " @entity75 "
but is @entity10 still a *relevant* reflection of the country today ?
