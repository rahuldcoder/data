-- the headlines seem like something from the past : congressional hearings are held to debate women 's access to contraceptives			2
a talk show host uses a derogatory and misogynist term to describe a graduate student seeking access to contraception on her campus			1
and for - profit employers are suing the government to avoid providing coverage for contraception within their employees ' insurance plans on the basis of their personal beliefs			1
but this is no flashback : these conversations about contraception are happening now , in the present day , with outdated views and inaccurate information playing a leading role			1
as physicians dedicated to improving the health of women , we ask : why is contraception still seen as controversial in the face of overwhelming evidence about its benefits ? why is birth control questioned , in this day and age , despite its widespread acceptance and use ? in the current debate , science and facts are being drowned out by highly vocal and misinformed voices ; as physicians , we must set the record straight			1
in the case that comes before the @entity49 on tuesday , owners of the craft store chain @entity46 and furniture makers @entity43 will argue against a provision in the @entity51 that requires insurance coverage of all @entity54 - approved contraceptive methods within employer - sponsored health insurance plans			1
in enacting this provision , the government agreed with @entity58 's medical professionals : birth control is essential health care that must be covered like any other preventive service			1
opinion : corporations playing religion card over birth control let us make clear that we respect the rights of others to have their own personal beliefs			2
however , in exercising these beliefs , the owners of @entity46 are denying scientific fact and asking to restrict employees ' access to important preventive care			2
for example , one of the debates with the @entity49 case centers around the employers ' opinion on how contraception works : the employers think that certain forms of contraception ( emergency contraception pills and intrauterine devices ) cause abortions			1
but what they believe about science is contradicted by the science itself			1
emergency contraception pills work by inhibiting or postponing ovulation , or the release of the egg , and this prevents fertilization from occurring			1
intrauterine devices ( @entity100 ) work by preventing sperm from reaching the egg , either by creating a barrier or by creating an environment that inhibits the mobility and viability of sperm or , in the case of copper iuds , potentially by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg before a woman is pregnant			2
none of these contraceptives causes abortion			2
already , contraceptive care is essential preventive care for millions of women			2
the ability to time and space children reduces fetal , infant and maternal morbidity and mortality			2
contraception can help families better plan for pregnancies , leading to more optimal health outcomes			1
planned pregnancies lower the risk of potentially serious issues such as low birth weight , preterm birth and small - for - gestational age			0
they also prevent an unanticipated worsening of health for women with pre-existing health conditions , such as diabetes or heart disease			0
of course , contraception reduces unintended pregnancy			1
there is a reason why , in a recent poll , a majority of @entity58 favored coverage of contraceptives : it is because we need look no further than our own homes to see the value of contraception			1
the typical @entity58 woman will have two children in her lifetime			0
that means she will spend more than three decades trying to avoid pregnancy			0
virtually all @entity58 women who are or have been sexually active have used contraceptives at some point during their lives			0
the value to women 's lives and families is clear			0
but for a woman to make the best decision about the birth control that is right for her , coverage of all @entity54 - approved contraceptives is necessary			0
cost of contraceptive care can be a major factor that determines not only which method a woman uses but whether she is able to use birth control at all			0
this is especially true for low - income and hourly workers			0
birth control is often an additional health expense that many women simply can not afford if money is tight , putting them at high risk for an unintended pregnancy			0
we see this problem frequently when we counsel our patients about the most effective contraceptives , namely iuds and implants			0
these methods are up to 20 times more effective than the birth control pill in preventing pregnancy , and they are often the safest options for our patients			0
but high up - front costs put these methods out of reach for a lot of women			0
insurance coverage for contraception without a co-pay would allow a woman to choose the best method for her , not just what fits in her budget			2
taking away coverage would effectively block access to those most - effective methods			0
birth control is not only safe and effective preventive care , it is also care that physicians support and millions of women need			0
allowing an employer 's personal values to trump his or her employees ' right to care would allow the beliefs of the few to trump the health of many			1
that 's both bad policy and bad medicine			1
as physicians committed to the health care and well - being of women , we urge the @entity49 to consider the crucial individual and public health issues at stake when they weigh their decision in this important case			1
the health of millions of women and their children hangs in the balance			0
join us on @entity240 / @entity239			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity243 and dr. @entity244 .			1

@entity49 will hear arguments about @entity51 provision
@entity243 and @entity244 wonder why contraception is still controversial
they argue that allowing employers ' values to trump science is bad policy , bad medicine
