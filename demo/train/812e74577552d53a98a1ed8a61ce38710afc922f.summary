-- an @entity1 who was once a @entity3 officer has been chosen " caretaker " leader of @entity5 in the wake of @entity9 's death , according to a source with detailed knowledge of the group 's inner workings			1
@entity5 's interim leader is @entity15 , who has long played a prominent role in the group , according to @entity18			1
@entity18 has known the @entity5 leadership for more than two decades			1
he was once a leader of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , a militant organization that used to be aligned with @entity5 , but in recent years renounced @entity5 's ideology			1
@entity18 told @entity0 that based on his personal communications with militants and discussions on jihadist forums , @entity26 , also known as @entity15 , had been chosen interim chief of @entity5 because the global jihadist community had grown restive in recent days about the lack of a formal announcement of a successor to @entity9			1
@entity32 : @entity9 communicated with @entity34 group according to @entity18 , this was not a decision of the formal shura council of @entity5 , because it is currently impossible to gather them in one place , but was rather the decision of six to eight leaders of @entity5 in the @entity45 - @entity44 border area			1
@entity46 was already one of the top leaders of the group			0
however , @entity18 said , the choice of an @entity1 may not sit well with some @entity52 and @entity34 members of @entity5 , who believe @entity9 's successor should come from the @entity54 , a region that is holy to all @entity55			1
@entity9 was from a wealthy @entity52 family			0
the presumed successor to @entity9 is his long - time deputy , @entity57 , who is also @entity1			2
@entity18 , who has long been a reliable source of information about @entity5 , said the temporary appointment of @entity26 may be a way for the leadership to gauge reaction to the selection of someone from beyond the @entity54 as the group 's leader			1
@entity46 fought the @entity68 in @entity45 during the 1980s			0
after the fall of the @entity70 in the winter of 2001 he fled to @entity72			0
according to senior @entity52 counterterrorism officials , from there @entity26 authorized @entity5 's branch in @entity52 to begin a campaign of terrorist attacks in the @entity52 kingdom that began in @entity78 in may 2003 , a campaign that killed scores			2
some reports in the past year have suggested that @entity26 had left @entity72 for @entity44			0
@entity44 announces key @entity5 arrest one of the key issues that @entity26 has to reckon with now is the fallout from the large quantities of sensitive information that was recovered by @entity32 forces at the compound in @entity89 , @entity44 , where @entity9 was shot on may 2			2
that information is likely to prove damaging to @entity5 operations			2
the selection of an interim leader allows @entity5 to begin the process of collecting allegiance , or baya , from @entity5 affiliates such as the @entity34 - based @entity97 and the @entity99 - based @entity98			1
@entity100 was a religious oath of allegiance to @entity9 rather than to the organization itself , in the same way that @entity106 members swore an oath of fealty to @entity109 rather than to @entity110			0
that baya must now be transferred to whomever the new leader of @entity5 is going to be , which is likely to be @entity57 , given his long role as @entity9 's deputy			1
opinion : why @entity9 was radicalized however , there is scant evidence that @entity57 has the charisma of @entity9 , nor that he commands the respect bordering on love that was accorded to @entity9 by members of @entity5			2
now that @entity9 is dead there is a real opportunity for the @entity70 to disassociate itself from @entity5 , as it was @entity9 who , sometime before the 9/11 attacks , swore an oath of allegiance to @entity70 leader @entity130 as the @entity131 , " commander of the faithful , " a rarely invoked religious title that dates from around the time of the @entity136			1
@entity130 could now take the position that the new leader of @entity5 does not need to swear an oath of allegiance to @entity130 as commander of the faithful			1
such a move would satisfy a key condition for peace talks with the @entity32 and @entity45 governments : that the @entity70 reject @entity5 , something that they have so far not done			2
@entity46 has been involved in militant activities since the late 1980s , according to an interview with him published in spring 2005 in the arabic - language @entity150 - based daily @entity149			0
in the article , written by @entity153 , a @entity154 journalist and writer , @entity26 recalled that he was detained for militant activities in @entity1 on may 6 , 1987			2
@entity5 's most - wanted leaders " the case pertained to the assassination attempt against @entity161 interior minister @entity160			0
... i was then a colonel in the @entity1 @entity3 , " he said			0
@entity46 also has been involved for years in anti-american activities , other sources indicate			0
@entity165 , one of the bombers of the @entity167 in @entity168 in august 1998 , told @entity170 interrogators that in 1993 he was ordered by @entity26 to go to @entity171 to link up with local tribes and train them to fight and attack @entity32 forces who were then serving there in a humanitarian mission to feed starving @entity171			0
and a @entity177 - @entity176 , @entity178 , who had trained in an @entity5 training camp in @entity45 before 9/11 , recalled in a memoir that @entity15 instructed him and other recruits to fight @entity32 forces around @entity183 or in the southern city of @entity185 during the @entity32 invasion of @entity45 in the fall of 2001 in the interview published in @entity149 , @entity26 also explained @entity5 's motivations for the 9/11 attack : " our main objective , therefore , was to deal a strike to the head of the snake at home to smash its arrogance			1
" after the fall of the @entity70 , @entity15 recalled that he and other members of @entity5 found refuge in @entity72 : " we began to converge on @entity72 one after the other , " he said			1
" ... we began to rent apartments for the fraternal brothers and some of their families			0
the fraternal brothers of the group of @entity211 " -- an @entity45 militant then living in exile in @entity72 who is now a leader of the insurgency in @entity45 -- " offered us satisfactory help in this field			0
they provided us with apartments and some farms that they owned			0
" but @entity46 said that the @entity72 subsequently arrested a large number of these " brothers			0

@entity18 says @entity15 is the " caretaker " leader of @entity5
the selection of an @entity1 might not be accepted by some in @entity5
@entity18 has known @entity5 leadership for two decades
