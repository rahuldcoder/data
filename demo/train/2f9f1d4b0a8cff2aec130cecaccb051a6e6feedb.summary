-- there is compelling evidence that the economic security of women and their families is more fragile today than ever			1
women are one - half of the nation 's workforce , yet disparities in pay , the shrinking of the public sector and stagnant wages have left too many women and families on the losing end of our nation 's economic recovery			1
nearly two - thirds of all minimum wage workers are women			0
the poverty rate among women is as high as it has been in 17 years			0
women are more likely to file for bankruptcy and have less retirement savings			0
women have rushed to get more education and training , but student debt has skyrocketed			2
five decades after the @entity33 , women still make just 77 cents for every dollar men make for the same job , an average real difference of $ 11,000 a year			2
@entity38 women -- single , widowed or divorced -- are the most economically insecure			0
these disparities persist for many reasons			0
too many women face financial pressures simply because of outdated policies and a " @entity46 " view of the world that constrain opportunities for women 's full participation in our economy			1
our country 's policies simply do not reflect the way families live today , with both parents in the workforce and more single - parent households than ever			2
a second income is no longer a luxury ; it is a necessity			0
for far too long , @entity62 has been silent on these issues			0
it 's time for an agenda that addresses the economic instability of women and their families			1
this week , @entity70 @entity69 announced an economic agenda for @entity73 's women and families			1
it recognizes a simple fact : when women succeed , @entity73 succeeds			1
it reflects the same spirit advanced 165 years ago at the first @entity80 at @entity81 , @entity82 , where @entity73 women began their quest for equal rights and equal opportunity			1
@entity70 @entity69 ' agenda -- " when women succeed , @entity73 succeeds : an @entity98 for @entity99 " -- stands on the shoulders of what was accomplished at at @entity81 and what was advanced by activists in every generation by addressing the economic challenges facing women and families in our time			1
our agenda promotes policies that raise wages and ensure pay equity in the workplace			2
it allows working parents to support their families , succeed in school and at the office , and care for their children			2
achieving good and equal pay for women is essential			1
we must enact paycheck fairness legislation to ensure women get paid what they deserve and put more money in the pockets of working women and their families			2
we must expand access to job training and education assistance so that working women can obtain better - paying jobs in the future			1
we must do more to support women - owned businesses and nurture entrepreneurship by providing more access to capital			2
today , women play an expanded role in the workforce , in businesses small and large , and in our homes as primary breadwinners			0
given this reality , we need policies that allow a better work and family balance for all workers , not just a select few at the top of the income ladder			0
the @entity69 ' agenda increases access to paid sick leave , expanding the @entity147 and protecting pregnant workers and new mothers so that they ca n't be fired or demoted			1
the high cost of child care is another economic barrier for working families , forcing too many to make a near - impossible choice between low - quality child care or forgoing wages to stay home to care for their children			0
that 's why we must increase access to affordable , quality child care			0
one key step forward should be to provide all low - and moderate - income 4 - year - olds with access to high - quality preschool , as proposed by president @entity167			0
@entity168 must also take steps to support early @entity170 and child care partnerships and expand existing child and child care tax credits			0
our pro-family agenda will help strengthen the middle class , grow our economy and provide a brighter future for the next generation			0
@entity69 have long led the way to address the health and economic security of women and families -- from the passage of the @entity185 and the @entity186 to our continued fight to strengthen and protect @entity188 and @entity189			1
our women and families economic agenda is the next step in our mission to expand opportunity for all @entity73			1
@entity73 women and their families are at an economic crossroads			1
we want them to succeed , not sink			0
that is why every chance we get we will call for passage of the policies necessary to meet the economic needs of @entity73 's women and families today , to help them succeed so @entity73 will succeed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

@entity210 and @entity211 : women and their families are worse off than ever
writers : we need fair , equal pay for women , early education for children , access to job training
they say old policies and " @entity46 " view of the world add to women 's money woes
