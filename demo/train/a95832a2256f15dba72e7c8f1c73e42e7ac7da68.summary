-- march 22 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 and @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : it 's our first show of spring ! and one of the rites of the new season : 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines			1
here to take you through it , i 'm @entity26			2
first up : health care @entity28 : first up , the question that dominated the weekend in @entity30 : who has the votes on president @entity34 's health care reform bill ? 216 was the magic number in the @entity37 @entity36			1
that means @entity39 who supported the bill needed to get at least 216 votes for it to pass			1
republicans and @entity39 who opposed the bill needed at least 216 votes against it to stop it from becoming law			1
that vote was expected to happen last night			2
but when we recorded today 's show , it had n't happened yet			1
you can get the latest details at @entity54			2
and , of course , we 'll have a lot more on this for you tomorrow			2
let 's back up and talk about what was happening leading up to yesterday 's scheduled vote			1
@entity39 were rallying to try to wrap up those 216 votes			1
some were guaranteeing the bill would go through , calling it a historic day			2
but @entity65 , who have been opposed to the bill , promised to keep fighting to try and stop it from becoming law			2
one @entity65 said if the bill did pass , they would try to repeal it			2
tension was high outside the @entity71 building over the weekend , too			2
as you can see in these pictures , protesters rallied to speak out against the bill			2
the @entity36 was actually voting on two things yesterday			1
the first was the health care reform bill that the @entity78 already passed			2
if the @entity36 approved that , it would go straight to president @entity34 for his signature ; it would become law			1
the second thing the @entity36 was voting on was a set of changes to the @entity78 bill			1
and if that was approved , it would still have to get through the @entity78 before it could become law			2
again , for the latest on all of this : @entity54			2
tuesday 's show will have details as well			1
word to the @entity94 @entity95 , @entity16 : a word to the @entity94 ... crest ( verb ) as a verb , crest means to reach the highest point or level source : www.dictionary.com @entity104 @entity28 : people in @entity106 and @entity6 are keeping a close eye on the @entity108			2
forecasters said that it crested yesterday at around 37 feet			2
that 's nearly 20 feet higher than flood stage			1
around @entity4 , 700,000 sandbags are guarding the city against the river 's waters			1
in fact , more than a million sandbags were stacked between @entity4 and @entity5 , @entity6			2
those sandbags can be removed once the river goes back below 30 feet , but the @entity121 says that probably wo n't happen until next sunday			2
the governor of @entity6 , @entity123 , says that planning for a possible flood might have helped keep the @entity108 at bay			1
gov. @entity123 , ( r ) @entity6 : we 're very confident in the flood fight			1
again , there will be damage , there will be some flooding			2
but we believe it 'll be a manageable event , in large part , because of the incredible preparation , skill and leadership of @entity138 all across this state who rallied to fight this flood and put maximum preparations in place to have an effective flood fight this year			1
@entity28 : now , @entity145 shows us how scientists try to plan for these flood situations			1
( begin video ) @entity150 , @entity0 all - platform journalist , @entity151 , @entity6 : this is @entity153 , and his job is critical			2
as a hydrologist with the @entity156 , he helps determine how high the river will go			1
@entity158 , @entity156 @entity159 : this instrument , we put it in the water and it actually sends a sound pulse down into the river , and it returns information on the speed of the particles and actually the depth			0
@entity171 : the data they collect here actually goes straight to the @entity121 and plays a big part in forecast development			0
the crest prediction was lowered a half foot friday and again saturday , thanks in part to the findings of the @entity156			0
@entity182 : the channel was moving water through a little bit more efficiently than we thought			0
@entity171 : the technology they use is new within the last decade			1
what used to take half a day can now be done in an hour			0
they send their findings here , to the river forecast center near the @entity193			0
@entity194 , @entity195 , @entity156 : we 're the technical experts and the modelers			0
we come up with a technical forecast			0
@entity171 : less ice on the river and less precipitation were factors in the lower crest outlook , plus the colder weather back in @entity4 translates to less snow melt			0
but lower temps do n't make @entity153 's job any easier			1
@entity182 : the equipment does n't want to work as well			0
we do n't want to work as well			0
but we get out here and we get the job done because it 's important			1
@entity171 : @entity145 , @entity0 , on the @entity108 , near @entity4			0
( @entity213 ) @entity214 @entity28 : heading across the @entity215 to @entity7 , a country that has more land covered by glaciers than all of @entity219			0
and underneath the country 's fifth - largest glacier : this ! a volcano that started erupting over the weekend			1
not unusual for @entity7 ; it sits on a volcanic hotspot			0
it 's had 21 eruptions in the past 47 years			1
but this is the first time that this particular volcano has erupted since 1821 , and experts say there was not a lot of warning			0
hundreds of people were evacuated ; police declared a state of emergency			0
one scientist said there 's just no way to know how long the eruption will last : could end today , could go on for a year or two			1
but he did add this is a small eruption			0
@entity243 @entity28 : well , figuring out the results of @entity246 's parliamentary election wo n't take a year or two , but it is going to take a while longer			1
the votes from the election -- it was on march 7th -- are still being tallied			0
but @entity246 prime minister @entity252 is calling for a recount			0
he says it 's to " preserve the integrity of the electoral process			1
" right now , the race is too close to call			0
based on partial results , @entity252 's party is leading in some of @entity246 's provinces , but it 's losing the overall vote			1
@entity246 's electoral commission has rejected the demand for a recount			1
a spokesman for the commission says there have to be " compelling reasons " for it , and they do n't think there are any			0
the final election results are expected to be announced on friday			0
@entity273 @entity274 , @entity16 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity277 's social studies classes at @entity278 in @entity279 , @entity280 ! gorillas belong to what scientific genus ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity288 , b ) @entity286 or @entity289 ) @entity290 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! gorillas are classified in genus gorilla			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! search for @entity290 @entity28 : gorillas are in the family of " great apes			1
" and according to the @entity304 , the @entity303 gorilla is the most endangered great ape in @entity306			1
for a while , people thought the species had already gone extinct			1
@entity310 takes us into the forests of @entity306 to learn about the dangers facing these gorillas and the people who are trying to help them			0
( begin video ) @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity8 : we 're searching @entity306 's last rainforest for its last remaining gorillas			1
@entity322 , @entity323 : these are the teeth of the gorilla			0
look at them biting it , you see , forcing it to break			0
@entity330 : it 's a rare sign that there are actually any gorillas left here			1
our trackers , who are ex-poachers now turned gaurdians for the gorillas , only see them maybe twice a year			0
sightings are so rare that these pictures shot last year are thought to be the only known images of the gorillas			0
the difficult terrain of these mountains has helped keep the gorillas out of sight and hidden from poachers			0
somewhere out there in the forest is the @entity303 gorilla			0
it 's the rarest in the world and also the most endangered ; they think there 's maybe 300 in @entity8 and @entity355 alone and just 35 in these @entity357 mountains			1
the local communities of the @entity357 mountains have come together to try and protect the gorillas , but disagreement over exactly how is proving divisive			0
but as we continued our search , we found signs of life : a gorilla nest only two to three weeks old			1
in your research , how important are these nests ? @entity369 , @entity370 : it 's very important because we rarely see them , and the only way we can get information on the population is by finding nests such as this to give us an idea of the population size and to give us an idea the ranging behavior of the gorillas			1
@entity330 : we did n't see any gorillas , but that is a hopeful sign ; the more these gorillas fear humans and stay hidden , the better their chances of survival			0
@entity310 , @entity0 , the @entity390 , @entity8			0
( @entity213 ) before we go @entity28 : before we go , if you 've ever wondered what it takes to put together a basketball court , the answer is about 10 - and - a - half hours ! we do n't have that kind of time , so we 're speeding things up for you			0
this is the @entity401 in @entity402 , @entity403			0
this is how workers transformed it from a hockey arena to a basketball stadium overnight ! we 're not sold on hiring these guys the next time we need to set up a party			0
goodbye @entity28 : but we are courting the idea			0
that sinks our last points for the day , but @entity0 will get your tuesday show on the rebound			0
join us when we begin our final four shows of the week tomorrow .			0
