-- the pivotal sex scene in the new " @entity3 " film , " @entity2 -- part 1 " is so steamy that the @entity4 originally gave the film an r rating , according to its star @entity7 , who says even she was shocked by what her character does between the sheets			1
" there are two big sex scenes in the two [ final ] films , and we did them fairly early , " @entity12 , 21 , tells the @entity14 edition of @entity15			1
" it was so weird , it did n't even feel like we were doing a scene within a ' @entity3 ' film			2
i was like , ' @entity25 ! what are you doing ? wow ! what is happening here ? ! ' it was very surreal			2
" off - screen , @entity12 's sex life is also of interest , particularly her relationship with " @entity3 " costar @entity35 , which @entity15 describes as " likely - but - never confirmed - nor - denied			1
" though the actress -- who 's currently shooting " @entity39 " -- certainly is n't a fan of such attention , she seems to take it in stride			1
" people can say whatever they want , " she says , calling the interest " totally understandable			2
but when it 's personal to you , it 's like your life becomes a product , and i 'm repelled by that			1
i do n't like to give away gems that people are gon na be like , ' oh my @entity54 ! ' so i 'll always just shrug it off			0
in fact , i always find it kind of funny , and not just with @entity35			0
" only 17 when she was first cast as @entity25 in the " @entity3 " saga , @entity12 says she 's finally starting to feel comfortable doing interviews , but that it 's " a fair assessment " to say she often comes off as shy and nervous in public			1
" i was young , not expecting it and trying way too hard to be ' not fake , ' " she says			0
and as far as the devotion from her fans , @entity12 says it 's something she can relate to			1
" there are definitely people that kind of lose it and get very emotional , " she says			0
" but recently , i met [ musician ] @entity76 , and i had the most ridiculous experience			0
i was so embarrassing , i could n't speak			0
it was eye - opening , actually			2
