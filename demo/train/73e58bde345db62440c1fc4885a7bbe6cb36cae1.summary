-- all entrances to the @entity2 are closed through the holiday weekend as firefighters continue to battle a 10 - week - old blaze that has burned well over half the 400,000 - acre preserve			1
@entity5 , a spokesman for the federal @entity6 , said the preserve will be shuttered to the public indefinitely -- at least until authorities , likely with major help from the weather , get it under control			1
the group is trying to corral what is being called the @entity15			2
" @entity17 is in charge , with both the cause of the fire and the resolution to it , " he said			1
@entity22 first sparked a fire on april 28 and it has been burning , in some form , ever since -- consuming about 268,000 of the refuge 's 402,000 acres			1
@entity27 meteorologist @entity26 noted that there 's no immediate relief in sight			1
" we are looking forward to dry conditions , with relative humidity near 30 to 35 % ( and ) temperatures slightly above normal at 95 degrees , " she said of the upcoming forecast for the region			0
" we are not expecting significant precipitation until tuesday			0
" centuries ago , the @entity38 called this area @entity41 , meaning " land of the @entity43 , " according to the refuge 's website			1
currently , this large swath of territory in south @entity48 and north @entity49 -- which includes cypress forest , lakes and islands , in addition to marsh -- is home to more than 400,000 species of animals including alligators , sandhill cranes and red - cockaded woodpeckers			0
while the threat has been ongoing , closures of certain once public parts of the park picked up last month			1
that includes the june 9 suspension of all boating from @entity68 , the june 13 closure of the @entity70 and all hiking trails near the east entrance , and the june 16 closure of @entity74			0
while the @entity2 is best known for its swamp , this moisture has done little to prevent further destruction			1
one major reason is that the region is in the third year of a drought , significantly decreasing water levels in the region			1
another complication is the terrain : the swamp makes it hard for bulldozers and engines to penetrate into certain areas			0
@entity5 said six helicopters and 76 fire engines have been assigned to fight the blaze			1
" accessibility is a problem , and you do n't want to upset the water flows , " the spokesman said of the sensitive environmental area			1
as @entity5 noted , wildfires are nothing new to the swamp , helping shape the terrain , clear out loose debris and provide good conditions for some vegetation			2
" @entity15 is part of how the swamp forms and continues to do its thing , " he said			0
" it has been part of the swamp for longer than we 've been around			0
" authorities ' primary focus continues to be making sure that the blaze does not engulf any properties surrounding the refuge , something that @entity5 said was not imminent but could happen at any moment , with a sudden and strong wind shift			2
the fire has had minimal impact on wildlife , said @entity122 , fire information officer for the refuge			1
turtles and the estimated 10,000 to 12,000 alligators are able to burrow into watery peat beds or below river banks			0
@entity122 , who worked for more than 30 years as a ranger at the refuge , said a 2007 wildfire was more problematic because of higher sustained winds			1
since 1988 , a cycle of droughts have contributed to swamp fires , he added			0
once visitors are allowed back in , they will be able to enjoy vistas not available for years , @entity122 told @entity0			0
a special treat is seeing wintering sandhill cranes from mid-november to february , he said			0
recent thunderstorms have dropped several inches of rain			0
but while such sporadic rains may help temporarily slow the fire , nothing has stopped it yet			2
that will require a significant and notable weather change , most likely in the form of a massive and sustained rainfall			2
" it 's likely going to take a major weather event -- in other words , rain with a name , " said @entity5 , referring to a hurricane , tropical storm or depression			1
@entity122 said the @entity156 symbolizes the ideal environment			0
" it 's a complete natural ecosystem , " he said			2
" it operates completely on its own			0
" @entity0 's @entity161 contributed to this report .			2

a wildfire that began april 28 is still raging in the @entity2
some 268,000 of the park 's 402,000 acres have burned and there 's no clear end in sight
all entrances to the refuge have been closed indefinitely , a fire spokesman says
the official says it will likely take a major weather event , like a hurricane , to douse the fire
