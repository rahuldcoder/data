@entity0 -- portions of a taxpayer - funded $ 2.1 billion @entity5 contract to truck supplies to @entity8 troops in @entity9 are being indirectly paid to @entity9 insurgents and corrupt public officials as protection money , a congressional investigation revealed			1
the @entity8 military outsources much of the security for truck convoys carrying food , water , equipment , fuel and ammunition to remote and dangerous areas in @entity9 , and those contractors hire local @entity9 who pay bribes for safe passage , according to investigators			1
" @entity8 tax dollars are feeding a protection racket in @entity9 that would make @entity33 proud , " rep. @entity26 , @entity27 , said tuesday , referring to an organized crime boss in the popular tv show " @entity30			1
" @entity34 make the remark at a hearing on the issue the @entity38 of the @entity39			2
" this contract appears to have fueled warlordism , extortion , corruption , and maybe even funded the enemy , " said @entity34 , who is chairman of the subcommittee			0
the hearing comes shortly after the release of a 79 - page congressional report that details findings ranging " from sobering to shocking , " @entity34 said in the report 's introduction			0
@entity1 reported on monday that the military is also investigating the issue			2
the results of the six - month investigation indicate that outsourcing the @entity9 supply chain to contractors has resulted in " significant unintended consequences , fueling warlordism , extortion , and corruption , and it may be a significant source of funding for insurgents , " the report 's executive summary said			1
" in other words , the logistics contract has an outsized strategic impact on @entity8 objectives in @entity9 , " the report said			1
investigators found that @entity5 " has been largely blind to the potential strategic consequences of its supply - chain contingency contracting , " and that the @entity8 military has little understanding of how the security is provided			1
when contractors reported to the @entity5 that they were being extorted by warlords for protection payments for safe passage and that these payments were " funding the insurgency , they were largely met with indifference and inaction , " the report said			1
the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) spokesman , @entity87 , said the @entity86 does have an investigation on " host - nation trucking " underway but he would not discuss details			2
the " @entity9 host @entity93 " contract in question stipulates that the prime contractors are responsible for the safe passage of the cargo that they carry			1
most contractors subcontract , hiring local @entity9 for armed protection of the convoys transporting supplies			1
the manager of the largest private security provider , @entity104 , said he complained to @entity8 military officials that his company had to pay bribes ranging from $ 1,000 to $ 10,000 monthly to @entity9 governors , police chiefs , and local military officials whose territory the convoys traversed			1
@entity5 officials confirmed they were aware of the bribes , according to the report			0
the private security companies that protect the convoys regularly encounter armed conflict with alleged insurgents and other criminal elements , the report says , and hundreds of security providers are killed annually			0
one key convoy security commander in @entity9 told investigators he spent $ 1.5 million on ammunition per month to protect his convoy trucks			1
investigators found no direct evidence of payoffs to the @entity131 , but many military officials overseeing the contract believed that the @entity131 did receive protection payments , based on information provided to them by contractor representatives , the report said			0
since mid- 2009 , contractors have completed over 40,000 missions , subcommittee statistics show			0
congressional members at tuesday 's hearing pressed witnesses for answers as to how the practice is allowed to continue			0
@entity146 , assistant deputy under secretary of defense for @entity148 , and who is involved with @entity5 acquisition and logistics , acknowledged the members ' frustrations that changes in the current conditions are n't happening quickly enough			0
but he said improvements wo n't happen overnight			0
" i assure you we 're taking it all seriously , " @entity146 said			0
" but if i was a cop on the other side , i would say , ' damn it , i 'm doing what i can with what i got			0
" @entity163 , a specialist in defense acquisition , said that for those who believe the @entity8 military should n't be using outside contractors , " the solutions include increasing the size of the military , rethinking current force structure , or choosing not to engage in certain contingency operations			2
" addressing those who believe that the problem is due to insufficient planning and poor management on the part of the military , @entity163 said , " the solution may be to develop an effective strategy for using @entity180 ( private security companies ) , improving operational planning , and enhancing oversight			0
" @entity163 acknowledged that the @entity5 has taken steps to improve its management and coordination of private contractors , and but warned more needs to be done .			2
