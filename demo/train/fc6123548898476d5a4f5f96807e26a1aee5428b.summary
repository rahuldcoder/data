-- the @entity1 is warning one of its members that stimulus spending , growing debt and a slower than expected recovery has become a volatile cocktail			1
no , it 's not @entity10			2
whichever party wins thursday 's general election will steer the fortunes of the world 's fifth largest economy , an influential global financial center and a deficit that the @entity1 forecasts will rise to 12 percent of @entity21 in 2010 -- even higher than @entity10			1
( @entity10 's 2009 deficit stands at 13.6 percent -- the commission estimates it will drop to 9.3 percent this year )			1
the elections come as the financial world has been roiled by events in @entity27 , such as the growing debt crisis of @entity10 , @entity29 and @entity30 and the massive economic disruption of the @entity33 volcano			1
narrow pre-election polls point to a possible hung parliament for the first time in 36 years , which could further add uncertainty to already shaky global markets			2
the markets did n't react when @entity12 elections were called a month ago , but that may soon change after the polls are closed : for the first time , @entity43 traders have been allowed a special election night session to trade bond and sterling futures -- and they 're expecting heavy action as banks try to stake out positions , rather than wait for the usual 8 a.m. open on friday			1
the @entity12 " is a financial mega-center , so for us as a financial institution we care very much ( about the election ) , " said @entity50 , senior economic analyst for @entity51 in @entity52			1
" in the global banking world we are very aware , more than ever , about what 's going on in continental @entity27 , what 's going on in the @entity12 , what 's going on in @entity61 , all of these things are much more interwoven now			1
" there 's clearly two very different views of the world represented in this election , and i think if we look at it from the economics point of view it certainly has implications for the growth potential of the @entity12 ( and ) for the regulatory environment in the @entity12 , so that could impact the financial industry very significantly , " @entity50 said			1
so far , the major parties have n't provided many specifics about how they plan to tackle the @entity12 's growing deficit , which crediting ratings agencies have warned may eventually impact its aaa rating			1
( @entity10 's credit rating was downgraded to junk status last week , sparking a weeklong decline in global markets )			1
are the ratings agencies credit worthy ? " i 'm concerned about ( the deficit ) in the medium to long term , but in the short term we need to keep this recovery going			2
what has been driving this is public sector stimulus and the difficulty is we have seen very little action in the private sector , " said @entity91 , a former @entity12 monetary policy adviser and economics professor at @entity93			2
" firms are n't investing and they are n't hiring , and if we pull public sector stimulus away the danger is we drop off a cliff			0
" while the deficit is worrying , market watchers point out that @entity43 is no @entity106			0
" we do n't have a bad track record			0
we should n't be compared to @entity10 , " said @entity108 , of @entity109			0
" this is actually a buoyant economy , in the fullness of time			0
it 's just the fact that the election really has gotten in the way of reality			2
" some worry that a hung parliament and any resulting coalition government may be fractious and short - lived			0
the last coalition government in 1974 lasted only seven months before new elections were called			0
" one benefit i think of actually having a hung parliament is that maybe it rules out the possibility that anybody would do anything stupid , " @entity91 said			0
" at this moment the status quo is perhaps not a bad thing to be in			0
@entity0 's @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report			0

elections hold fate of the world 's fifth largest economy and a major financial center
world markets will watch carefully the outcome of election as *eurozone* troubles *escalate*
