@entity0 -- @entity3 's foreign minister called for a new international initiative for @entity5 to protect civilians and increase pressure on president @entity8 to stop his bloody crackdown , saying his country would not remain indifferent to a " massacre in its back yard			1
" in the wake of the @entity16 's failure to pass a resolution , @entity13 says like - minded countries should look for ways outside the @entity21 system to end the killing and deliver aid to civilians under artillery attack from government forces , particularly in the besieged city of @entity27			1
" now we need to revitalize a new international initiative , " @entity13 told reporters friday			1
" we hope that with such a strong message those who are supporting @entity8 or ( the ) regime at this moment , they will have to make a reassessment , " @entity13 said , referring to @entity31 and @entity32 , which vetoed the resolution			2
" what we need today is to send a strong message to the @entity5 people that they are not alone , " he added			0
@entity43 , @entity13 said , has lost all credibility both inside @entity5 and around the world			1
he pointed to the increasing number of defections from the @entity5 army , estimating that about 40,000 soldiers had abandoned their posts following orders to attack civilians			0
@entity3 is @entity54 's most important @entity53 member state and has emerged as a key diplomatic troubleshooter in the @entity56 in recent years , working closely with the @entity57 to help formulate the @entity16 resolution on @entity5 that was vetoed last week by @entity31 and @entity32			2
@entity59 also has tried to broker the nuclear standoff between @entity61 and world powers			1
@entity13 told reporters he believes that @entity61 is ready for talks about its nuclear program			1
@entity13 said @entity3 had talks with @entity8 and then worked with the @entity57 , but @entity59 's hopes faded when president @entity8 failed to implement a road map for reforms			1
" we wanted @entity8 to be @entity73 , but he chose to be @entity5 's @entity74 said @entity13 , comparing the parallels between the events in @entity5 and the massacres carried out by the former @entity79 leader , @entity74 , in @entity80 during the ' 90s			2
while @entity3 has long maintained it is against foreign military intervention , @entity13 said his country can not stand idly by while regimes open attack against their people			1
" if there is an oppression by an autocratic leader against the people , nobody can expect us or the international community to be silent , " @entity13 said later friday during a speech to the @entity89			2
" when i went to @entity96 last august , i made it very clear to [ @entity8 ] , i said mr. president if there is any foreign attack against you we will be siding with you , but if you fight against your own people and force us to decide to be either with you or with the people , we will be with the people			0
" @entity13 said he would propose new ways to turn up the heat on the @entity8 regime when he meets monday with secretary of state @entity108 , but declined to provide specifics			1
last week in @entity112 , after the @entity21 resolution failed to pass , @entity110 pledged to work with the the " @entity113 " worldwide to support the @entity5 opposition 's peaceful plans for change			1
senior @entity118 officials said the evolving coalition of like - minded countries will discuss ways to bolster the opposition , strengthen existing sanctions against @entity96 and seek further ones to block funding and arms shipments to the @entity8 regime			0
the @entity118 is also trying to find a way to provide humanitarian aid to @entity5 civilians , which @entity13 called a " must			2
" " it is time for humanitarian access to these cities , " he said , particularly referencing cities like @entity27 that are being shelled by @entity5 forces			0
there must be some international initiatives for this humanitarian access			0
" he said @entity3 was currently providing refuge for some 12,000 @entity5 who have fled the fighting and would host as many as needed , but said those civilians left behind were in dire need , although he did n't specify how it could be delivered			2
" if @entity31 and @entity32 want to help to @entity5 , they must be helpful for this humanitarian access			0
this is not foreign intervention , " he said , alluding to @entity31 fears the @entity147 will back a @entity149 - style foreign military campaign			0
on @entity61 , @entity13 said previous efforts to reach agreement between @entity154 and the so - called " @entity155 plus one " failed because of a lack of trust on both sides			1
but he said @entity61 now seems more willing to discuss a deal that would curb its ability to produce weapons - grade uranium			0
" i think this time , @entity61 has seen that there is a need for negotiation , " he said			0
" this time , i am more optimistic			0
" but @entity165 was unequivocal when it came to where @entity3 stands over the possibility of an @entity170 military strike on @entity61 's nuclear program			1
" a military strike is a disaster , " he said at @entity89			0
" it is not reasonable , it is not feasible , and we will be against it , we will never , never endorse any military strike , " @entity13 said .			0

@entity3 foreign minister says efforts could be outside @entity21
@entity43 , the minister says , has lost all credibility
@entity13 is meeting with @entity110 on monday
he is more optimistic over talks with @entity61 on nuclear issues
