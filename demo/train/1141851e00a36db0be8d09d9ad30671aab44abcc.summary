@entity0 -- the sailboat crew chose an ocean - size ambition			1
they sought to land in @entity5 from @entity0 with cruise ship - like speed , in less than five days			1
what they never expected to encounter was as unimaginable as a sea monster : a massive debris field floating in the middle of the @entity14			0
its origin ? the catastrophic tsunami that obliterated coastal @entity18 two years ago			1
" we experienced ' @entity22 's @entity21 , ' " yacht owner @entity23 told @entity1 by satellite phone hours after his boat sustained significant damage after hitting two telephone poles and other objects			1
@entity22 is the @entity18 city known for a nuclear meltdown in the 2011 tsunami			1
despite the setback , @entity23 and his @entity32 crew finished first in the 2,225 - nautical - mile race ( or 2,560 miles ) , but they were thwarted in setting a record , despite a highly orchestrated campaign to do so			1
the three - hulled sailboat , called a trimaran , was considered a likely contender to set a record because the 73 - foot boat is considered among the 10 fastest yachts in the world and was the only one of those 10 competing in the race , according to the team 's spokesman			1
exhausted friday from having received little sleep over five days , the boat 's captain , @entity50 , told @entity1 he was largely blaming what 's become a disturbing reality on the high seas : plumes of drifting junk			1
" the fact of the modern world is that this stuff is out there , " @entity50 said			2
" i sailed around the world , and even then i remember commenting on how much trash and man - made debris was out there			2
" we ran into six different pieces of tinder , " @entity50 continued			0
" tree trunks , telephone poles and whatever else caused damage to the underwater surfaces of the boat that keep you going straight and fast			1
" these impacts hobbled the progress of the vessel @entity77			0
the nine sailors aboard improvised repairs to a damaged daggerboard , a vertical board which slides through the central hull and submerges to keep the boat from slanting sideways			1
" that immediately started to break apart			0
there was a big impact on the edge which caused it to split open			0
we had to stop the boat and figure out how to pull it up through the bearings			2
it took us a few hours to be able to sail again , " @entity50 said			0
the crew used small , battery operated tools to fix the centerboard -- which looked like it suffered a very bad shark bite			0
" it was just a mess to fix those problems , " @entity50 said			0
" we 're talking about 12 hours that we lost to the finishing time because of these issues			0
" the racing crew set out saturday to be the first competitors in an annual @entity105 to beat @entity107 's 1997 record of traveling from @entity0 to @entity108 on an 86 - foot catamaran in five days , nine hours , 18 minutes , and 26 seconds			1
the @entity77 fell short by more than two hours , posting a time of five days , 11 hours , 52 minutes and 33 seconds			0
" i bought this boat to be a challenger for breaking the record , " @entity23 said			1
" we lengthened the floats , installed a new foil system and put together a new sail program			0
" for two years , he worked to build a team of world - class sailors -- using his connections in the sport during the recruiting			2
shortly after dawn friday , the crew was just beginning to take vacation time in @entity5 , after a night of post-race celebrations			2
they were undaunted by the menaces afloat in the world 's biggest ocean			2
" i can definitely see us coming back to try and beat it again -- it 's a great race , " @entity50 said .			0

sailor @entity23 spends two years preparing for world record try to @entity5
he recruits the best crew he can find
but his 73 - foot trimaran strikes drifting telephone poles from @entity18 's 2011 tsunami
damage to the central daggerboard thwarts a record , but boat still finishes first
