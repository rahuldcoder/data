-- the @entity1 has long sought to grow golf outside the continent , taking top players around the world to @entity6 , the @entity7 and @entity8 , while its second - tier circuit even visited @entity10 this year			1
its latest bid to break new ground -- the largely untapped golfing market of @entity14 -- has been driven by the desires of one of its major sponsors			0
one of the tour 's premier events , the @entity19 , will next year move home from economically - stricken @entity23 to @entity24 -- which does n't have a player ranked in the world 's top 1,500 professionals , but has attracted car manufacturer @entity28			1
" @entity28 was the first company to bring a @entity1 event to @entity34 and we are the first to take a full @entity1 event to @entity24 , as @entity14 is an important business area for us , " the @entity31 corporation 's president of event management said on monday			1
" we are very proud to still be delivering ground - breaking innovations as we mark our 130th professional golf tournament			2
everyone at @entity28 looks forward to welcoming @entity24 to the ' family ' of exclusive host destination partners			1
" the tournament was staged at @entity45 's @entity44 from 1964 to 2009 , and this year was the last at its second home at @entity47			0
next year 's venue , @entity49 , has been hailed as @entity24 's version of the famous @entity52 coastal course @entity53			2
" you will not find a golf course like this anywhere else on the planet , " said its designer , @entity8 golf legend @entity54 , who won the @entity19 title five times between 1965 - 1973			1

" i 've never been to @entity24 but i 've heard great things about the country and @entity49 , " the @entity94 said			0
" having won both the 2011 @entity63 and the @entity97 , i think @entity28 might be my lucky charm so so i hope that continues to be the case in 2013			2

this time the winner will take home â ‚ ¬ 888,560 ( $ 1.16 million ) " to go to back and win for the second time would really put the icing on the cake of what has already been a great year for me , " said the 23 - year - old @entity116 , who claimed his second major title at august 's @entity119			0
