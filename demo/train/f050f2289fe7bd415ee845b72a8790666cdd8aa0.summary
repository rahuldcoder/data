-- a hundred years ago on this day , on august 8th , 1914 , the @entity2 @entity1 and @entity3 protected cruisers bombed @entity5 , then the capital of @entity6 , bringing the @entity8 so - called " war to end all wars " to the eastern @entity11 shores			1
the day before , @entity14 - @entity13 forces constituted of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity20 troops had invaded @entity21 in @entity22			2
among @entity25 campaigns , the @entity11 one was the longest of all : as the armistice was being signed in @entity8 on november , 11th 1918 , the last of the @entity6 forces were still fighting their @entity2 counterparts			1
indeed the general who led them only surrendered two weeks later , on november , 25th 1918			2
but who knows any of this , whether in @entity35 , in @entity8 or indeed in @entity6 ? as the world commemorates the @entity39 of the @entity25 , the @entity11 side of this story remains a footnote , despite huge losses of human lives and major consequences for the future of the @entity11 continent			1
the @entity6 campaign was the opposite of the @entity8 war of trenches : it was about mobility , short raids and long treks on foot			0
the @entity6 @entity54 , white @entity6 commanders and black @entity11 soldiers called askaris , never exceeded 25,000 men			1
the @entity2 however assembled 150,000 troops : @entity60 and @entity61 at first , joined by @entity62 and @entity16 later on			0
but none of these soldiers would ever have survived , let alone be able to fight , without the unmentioned exploitation of porters			1
for every one soldier , @entity6 and @entity2 troops used four " native carriers , " including women and children , who howled food supplies , arms and even artillery ; cooked , scrubbed and tended to their needs ; and died of exhaustion , malnutrition and disease			0
of the 105,000 deaths among @entity2 forces during the @entity6 campaign , 90 % were porters			2
45,000 among the dead were from @entity81 ( @entity62 ) alone			0
read this : @entity11 writers you should be reading general @entity85 , the @entity6 commander , is often lauded for his military genius , outwitting the @entity2 during four years with barely a fifth of their numbers			1
some of the tales written are nothing short of @entity92			0
but von @entity85 had been ordered not to engage by @entity93			0
as far as i am concerned , his actions would be better described as a war - mongering megalomaniac effort by a military commander responsible for the callous deaths of 300,000 porters , the looting of hundreds of villages and the devastation of years of crops			2
if the death toll had been of @entity6 lives , would he have been as celebrated in the scrolls of @entity108 ? it is unclear that askaris actually volunteered to be part of the @entity54 , considering just a decade earlier , in 1905 , the @entity109 had violently suppressed one of the largest uprisings against colonial rule on the @entity11 continent , the @entity118 rebellion			1
that same year , @entity109 carried out the first genocide of the century against the @entity120 in @entity121 ( @entity122 )			0
@entity123 , subjugation and inhumane practice ruled in the @entity6 colonies , and this is how it should be remembered			0
all told , two million @entity11 soldiers , workers and porters were directly involved in @entity130 never fully acknowledged , @entity8 's great war was a war of colonials and a colonial theater of war			1
as i reflect on this day , a public holiday ( @entity138 ) for farmers in @entity140 , i remember a hundred years ago 750,000 square miles of land was inundated and destroyed , i remember the farmers who were forcefully dragged into this as porters			2
i remember @entity144 who fought other @entity144 for reasons unknown to them			0
the erasure of @entity6 's involvement in @entity25 , including the ongoing centenary commemorations , painstakingly reminds us that , once again , it is for us to make sure history is told in full			1
my commitment to @entity153 in @entity154 finds its roots in this necessity : history should be unearthed and a critical lens applied , especially by us @entity144			0
what happened in @entity6 should not stay in @entity6			0
read this : @entity11 writers you should be reading more from @entity11 voices the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			1

as world commemorates the @entity39 , the @entity11 story remains a footnote
@entity39 *resulted* in huge losses of @entity11 lives , had consequences for continent 's future
two million @entity11 soldiers , workers and porters were directly involved in @entity25
