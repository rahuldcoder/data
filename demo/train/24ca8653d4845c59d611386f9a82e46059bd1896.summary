-- it is perhaps the most iconic sports photograph ever taken			2
captured at the medal ceremony for the men 's 200 meters at the @entity7 , @entity4 sprinter @entity3 stands defiantly , head bowed , his black - gloved fist thrust into the thin air			1
behind him fellow @entity4 @entity11 joins with his own @entity13 salute , an act of defiance aimed at highlighting the segregation and racism burning back in their homeland			1
it was an act that scandalized the @entity21			0
@entity3 and @entity11 were sent home in disgrace and banned from the @entity21 for life			0
but they were treated as returning heroes by the black community for sacrificing their personal glory for the cause			0
history , too , has been kind to them			0
yet few know that the man standing in front of both of them , the @entity34 sprinter @entity33 who shocked everyone by powering past @entity11 and winning the silver medal , played his own , crucial role in sporting history			1
on his left breast he wore a small badge that read : " @entity48 " -- an organization set up a year previously opposed to racism in sport			2
but while @entity3 and @entity11 are now feted as human rights pioneers , the badge was enough to effectively end @entity33 's career			1
he returned home to @entity34 a pariah , suffering unofficial sanction and ridicule as the @entity13 salute 's forgotten man			1
he never ran in the @entity21 again			0
" as soon as he got home he was hated , " explains his nephew @entity58 , who has directed a new film -- " salute ! " -- about @entity33 's life before and after the @entity7			1
" a lot of people in @entity4 did n't realize that @entity33 had a much bigger role to play			1
he was fifth ( fastest ) in the world , and his run is still a @entity70 record today			0
and yet he did n't go to @entity71 ( 1972 @entity21 ) because he played up			0
he would have won a gold			2
" he suffered to the day he died			0
" an obscure pick @entity33 grew up in a working - class district of @entity75			1
as a youngster he could n't afford the kit to play @entity78 , his favorite sport			2
but his father managed to borrow a secondhand pair of running spikes , and his talent for sprinting was quickly recognized			0
yet @entity33 was still an obscure pick when the 28 - year - old arrived in the high altitude of @entity88			1
it was the first time he had run on an @entity48 standard track , and he thrived in the thin air			0
" i could feel my knees bouncing around my chin , " @entity33 said in " salute ! " " it lengthened my stride by about 4 inches ! " it was events off the track that had dominated the lead - up to the @entity7			1
in the @entity4 , the civil rights movement fought running battles with the police and army across @entity4 against segregation and racism			0
both @entity107 and @entity108 had been assassinated and the @entity109 was raging			0
meanwhile , in @entity88 , hundreds of protesting students were massacred in the run - up to the @entity112			1
the regime covered up their deaths as the athletes arrived			0
@entity34 too , was in the midst of racial strife			1
the country 's " @entity120 " policy had provoked protests of its own			2
it put heavy restrictions on non-white immigration -- and a raft of prejudicial laws against its indigenous aboriginal population , including a policy of taking @entity132 children from their birth parents and handing them to white couples for adoption , a practice that continued until the 1970s			0
unexpected threat although @entity33 was a staunch anti-racism advocate , no one expected him to take a stand in @entity88			1
the @entity140 had laid out just three rules for him to follow			0
the first was to repeat his qualification time before the @entity112			0
" rule number two : do n't finish last in any round , " @entity33 recalled			1
" third , and under no circumstances , do n't get beaten by a @entity147 ( a @entity148 runner )			0
" @entity33 had previously been ignored by the @entity4 team , who had assumed they 'd win a clean sweep of medals in the 200 meters , but he burst on to their radar when he broke the @entity48 record in one of the early heats			1
" when i first saw @entity33 , i said , ' who 's this little white guy ? ' " @entity11 told @entity0			1
he would soon regret the oversight			0
when the 200 meters final arrived , all eyes were on the @entity4 duo			1
@entity3 was expected to win easily ( " you would n't be able to catch him on a motorbike , " was @entity33 's assessment ) but the speculation centered on what political gesture the @entity4 athletes might make on the podium			1
the starting pistol was fired and @entity3 powered to gold			0
but out of nowhere @entity33 stormed down the last 50 meters , taking the line before a shocked @entity11			1
@entity33 's time of 20 seconds flat would have won gold four years later at the @entity173 and at the @entity112 in 2000			1
a fateful decision @entity3 and @entity11 had already decided to make a statement on the podium			2
they were to wear black gloves			0
but @entity11 left his at the @entity48 village			0
it was @entity33 who suggested they should wear one each on alternate hands			1
yet @entity33 had no means of making a protest of his own			1
so he asked a member of the @entity4 rowing team for his " @entity48 " badge , so that he could show solidarity			0
" he came up to me and said , ' have you got one of those buttons , mate , ' " said @entity4 rower @entity191			0
" if a white @entity34 is going to ask me for an @entity48 badge , then by @entity196 he would have one			1
i only had one , which was mine , so i took it off and gave it to him			0
" the three men walked towards their destiny			0
the medals were handed out before the three turned towards the flags and the start of the @entity206			0
" i could n't see what was happening , " @entity33 said of that moment			1
" i had known they had gone through with their plans when a voice in the crowd sang the @entity4 anthem but then faded to nothing			0
" the fallout was immediate for @entity3 and @entity11 , who were sent home in disgrace			0
@entity33 was never given the chance to go a step closer			2
he was never picked to run in the @entity21 again			0
" i would have dearly loved to go to @entity71 ( but ) i 'd earned the frowning eyes of the powers that be in track and field , " he said in " salute ! " " i 'd qualified for the 200 meters 13 times and 100 meters five times ( but ) they 'd rather leave me home than have me over there ( in @entity71 )			1
" shunned in his own country ? @entity33 retired from athletics immediately after hearing he 'd been cut from the @entity71 team			1
he would never return to the track			2
neither would his achievements count for much 28 years later when @entity235 hosted the @entity236			0
" at the @entity236 he was n't invited in any capacity , " says @entity58			0
" there was no outcry			0
he was the greatest @entity48 sprinter in our history			2
" in his own country @entity33 remained the forgotten man			1
as soon as the @entity4 delegation discovered that @entity33 was n't going to attend , the @entity245 arranged to fly him to @entity235 to be part of their delegation			2
he was invited to the birthday party of 200 and 400 - meter runner @entity251 , where he was to be the guest of honor			2
@entity251 took his hand , hugged him and declared that @entity33 was one of his biggest heroes			2
" @entity33 was not sanctioned ... we are not sure why he missed selection in 1972 but it had nothing to do with what happened in @entity88 , " the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) told @entity0 when asked about @entity33 's exclusion from the team that traveled to @entity71			1
" @entity33 was not excluded from any @entity236 celebrations			2
" the @entity140 points out that @entity34 's greatest ever sprinter had been given several crucial roles in the festivities			1
" he represented the @entity140 at several team selection announcements , " it said , " including the announcement of the table tennis team in his home town of @entity75 prior to the @entity112			0
" remembering @entity33 when " salute ! " was released in @entity34 in 2008 it caused a sensation , breaking box office records			1
in a country known for its reverence of sporting legends , many were hearing @entity33 's story for the first time			1
but he would never see the film that would put his achievements back into the public consciousness			2
@entity33 died of a heart attack on october 9 , 2006			2
at the funeral both @entity3 and @entity11 gave the eulogy , where they announced that the @entity4 @entity291 association had declared the day of his death to be " @entity293 " -- the first time in the organization 's history that such an honor had been bestowed on a foreign athlete			2
both men helped carry his coffin before it was lowered into the ground			0
for them , @entity33 was a hero -- " a lone soldier , " according to @entity11 -- for his small but determined stand against racism			2
" he paid the price			0
this was @entity33 's stand for human rights , not @entity33 helping @entity3 and @entity11 out , " @entity3 told @entity0			1
the three had remained friends ever since their chance meeting on that podium in @entity88 44 years ago			1
" he just happened to be a white guy , an @entity34 white guy , between two black guys in the victory stand believing in the same thing			2
" a proud legacy arguably the biggest price @entity33 paid was the fact that his run in the 200 meters final had been obscured by the @entity13 salute			1
it remains to this day one of the finest , and least expected , individual performances by a sprinter at the modern @entity21			0
by the end of the final , @entity33 had shaved half a second off his best time			2
his full potential was never realized yet , even after the ignominy of his return , @entity33 bore no grudges			1
" it has been said that sharing my silver medal with that incident on the victory dais detracted from my performance , " @entity33 explains poignantly at end of " salute ! " " on the contrary			1
i have to confess , i was rather proud to be part of it			0

at @entity88 1968 , @entity34 sprinter @entity33 won silver in the 200 meters
he was the third man on the podium during the *infamous* @entity13 salute
@entity33 was shunned on his return to @entity34 for joining the protest
a film sheds new light on his role in one of sport 's most iconic moments
