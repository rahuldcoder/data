-- the fate of famed aviator @entity2 remains a mystery after dna tests on one of three bone fragments discovered on a @entity8 island proved inconclusive			1
@entity9 of the @entity11 's @entity10 reported " the question of whether the bone is human must remain unanswered " until new technologies may make a determination possible			1
the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) asked @entity9 to test the bones found in 2010 on @entity19 , formerly @entity19			0
the bone tested by @entity9 may be from @entity2 's finger , the group says			1

she was later declared dead			0
" you learn patience , " @entity17 executive director @entity26 said wednesday night about the findings			1
" the door is still open for it to be a human finger bone			1
" according to @entity26 , a @entity34 officer found 13 bones , including a skull , of a likely castaway on the island in 1940 and sent them to @entity39			2
the officer also reported finding the remains of a woman 's shoe and a man 's shoe			0

any results would have to be independently verified			0
@entity17 has dna samples from a female relative of @entity2 that could be tested with any bones definitively found to be human , @entity26			1
@entity9 also reported that possible fecal clumps found in the same area will continue to be tested			0
it 's possible definitive human dna can be confirmed			0
