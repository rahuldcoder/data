-- dozens of @entity2 have been among the thousands of foreigners who flocked to @entity5 to take part in its bloody , messy civil war			1
yet for the three years , there was only one known @entity2 casualty			1
but , in a few short days , that death toll may have tripled			0
on wednesday -- months after a @entity13 man killed himself in a northern @entity5 suicide bombing and a day after news broke that @entity15 , a 33 - year - old man reared in @entity16 , died fighting for @entity17 -- a coalition of @entity5 opposition groups announced that its forces had killed another @entity2 in battle			1
the coalition did not name the fallen @entity2			1
but it did say he and @entity15 died as its forces battled @entity26 , a historical reference to fanatical @entity28 who rejected moderate teachings and advocated killing those who violated ultraconservative values			0
the coalition noted that its fighters from groups with names such as @entity36 , the @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 had joined those from the more moderate @entity43 and more extremist @entity44			1
they took on @entity17 forces last weekend in and around @entity46 -- which is where @entity15 was killed			2
@entity48 spokeswoman @entity47 , who was among those who reported @entity15 's death , said the @entity2 government is " looking into " this latest reported @entity2 casualty , even if it has n't confirmed his death			1
still , the idea of more @entity2 fighting for groups like @entity17 , and more of them dying , would n't be surprising			1
@entity5 , after all , is n't exactly a stable place with stable borders			2
nor is neighboring @entity59 , where @entity17 -- under the name it calls itself , the @entity62 -- has made major advances in recent weeks			2
" the ability to travel into these countries demonstrates how porous the borders are , " said @entity64			0
gen. @entity67 , who had top roles in the @entity69 in president @entity71 's administration			0
" i think we need to understand that there 's going to be more of this rather than less of this			0
" sources : @entity15 radicalized gradually there are no details on the third @entity2 casualty , but more is known about the other two			2
the first was @entity81 , a 22 - year - old from @entity13 who joined @entity44 , an @entity82 - linked organization that the @entity2 government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization			1
the group showed a video of him , and @entity2 officials later confirmed , taking part in a suicide bombing earlier this year in northern @entity5			1
@entity2 : jihadi in suicide bombing video grew up in @entity13 and on tuesday , the world was introduced to @entity94			1
friends and relatives described him as a decent man who loved to play basketball and loved his family			0
his conversion to @entity28 did n't alarm his relatives , according to uncle @entity103 , though @entity105 posts in support of @entity17 did			0
he 'd been on @entity2 authorities ' radar for some time by then			2
they become aware of @entity15 in the early 2000s , due to his association with others -- including one person from @entity16 who died in @entity114 , apparently while fighting as a jihadi -- a @entity2 official said			1
still , there was no indication then that @entity15 -- who at one point studied @entity120 at @entity121 -- was involved in anything nefarious			0
law enforcement sources told @entity0 that he appears to have radicalized gradually in the years since his conversion			0
authorities did n't know about @entity15 's travels to @entity128 until he was already there , a @entity2 official said			1
@entity128 was also the last place where , several months ago , @entity15 was in contact with his relatives			0
at the time of his death , at least , @entity15 was on a list of @entity2 believed to have joined militant groups			1
such people would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if they traveled , according to the official			0
@entity48 spokeswoman @entity47 added that @entity2 authorities knew about @entity15 's ties to @entity17			2
@entity47 did n't say how they approached his case , specifically , though she did lay out the government 's general strategy and concerns about cases like his			0
" we use every tool we have to disrupt and dissuade individuals from traveling abroad for violent jihad and to track and engage those who return ( to the @entity2 ) , " @entity47 told reporters wednesday			2
" ( @entity15 ) is a reminder of the growing concern that the @entity2 has , that many countries in the world have , about the thousands of foreign fighters from 50 nations who are engaged in @entity5 and who are affiliating themselves with ... extremist groups			1
" opinion : @entity17 : is it really a threat to the @entity2 ? official : @entity2 - turned - extremists ' willing ... to die ' @entity17 , especially , is n't just any extremist group			1
its tactics are so brutal that even @entity82 -- which was behind the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- disown them			0
defense secretary @entity171 last week called @entity17 " beyond just a terrorist group			0
they marry ideology , a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess			0
" this is beyond anything we have seen , and we must prepare for everything			0
" who is @entity17 ? that includes more @entity2 dying			2
some might be like @entity15 , who went to the @entity183 to join the jihad			0
or there may be more like @entity186 , the @entity2 journalist that @entity17 beheaded -- a gruesome execution that it videotaped and broadcast , along with the promise of more such killings if the @entity2 does n't continue to strike @entity17 in @entity59			1
not only are n't @entity2 officials refusing to back down against @entity17 in @entity59 , they are signaling that they might go after the group in @entity5			1
if president @entity195 oks such strikes , he 'd be on the same side as @entity5 president @entity198			1
nonetheless , @entity2 officials insist they wo n't coordinate with @entity198 ; in fact , the @entity195 administration is pushing @entity201 for funding to train and equip " moderate opposition " forces trying to unseat the @entity5 leader			1
official : @entity195 weighing options against @entity17 in @entity5 military action is n't the only way the @entity2 is going after @entity17 , officials say			1
there are also things like cutting off funding for the group as well as promoting stable and productive governments as an alternative to @entity17			0
but the @entity2 focus is n't just about what 's happening in @entity5 and @entity59			1
it 's also about making sure there are n't people like @entity15 who join @entity17 and end up returning home -- perhaps intending to unleash the group 's brutal brand of terror in their homelands			2
to this point , @entity227 spokesman @entity226 insisted wednesday " we are working with @entity230 and other law enforcement agencies , as well as homeland security agencies ... throughout the @entity233 and the region , to try to monitor the movements of these individuals and to mitigate the threats			0
" ... these are individuals who have been radicalized , " @entity226 said			0
" these are individuals who received some military training			0
and they have demonstrated , as mr. @entity15 did , a willingness to die for their cause			2
" @entity245 man arrested , wanted to join @entity17 man arrested after overseas trip , accused of sympathizing with @entity17 @entity0 's @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 contributed to this report .			0
