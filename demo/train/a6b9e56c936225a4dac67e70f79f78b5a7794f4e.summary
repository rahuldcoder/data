-- simply put , @entity1 made an impression			1
given her jet - black hair , thick black eyeliner , black clothes and combat boots ( which she often slept in while on assignment ) , people did n't always know what to think upon meeting her			2
she was quirky , the sort who excused herself from a social gathering by saying she had to wash her socks			2
and she was fearless , the kind of woman who not only kept the camera rolling while under fire , but zoomed in on a soldier who was shooting at her			2
colleagues learned quickly to appreciate all that this @entity0 camerawoman was			1
beyond her rich personality , which included deep optimism and kindness , she brought to her profession top - notch technical abilities , unmatched dedication and an approach to work that inspired others to push themselves			2
@entity0 colleagues honor @entity1 @entity1 sought out , even demanded , assignments in conflict zones			1
she barely survived being shot in the face in @entity40 in 1992 , only to go back as soon as she was physically able			1
the multiple reconstructive surgeries that followed , as well as the hepatitis c she contracted from a consequent blood transfusion , were mere obstacles she moved around			0
but more than three years after being diagnosed with colon cancer , her tremendous life journey has come to an end			1
@entity1 , known for her gutsiness , striking appearance , distinctive humor and sense of fun , died early sunday in @entity53 , @entity54			1
" dying of cancer , i would have liked to think i 'd have gone out with a bit more flair , " she said with a laugh last spring during an interview with a @entity0 documentary crew that had traveled to @entity58 , where she was visiting friends			1
" the important thing is to know that you 've lived your life to the fullest , " she said then , before tubing down a river in @entity65 , @entity58 ; taking jaunts to @entity67 and the @entity68 ; and piloting a houseboat up the @entity70 -- replete with beer and @entity73 cigars			1
" i do n't know anyone who 's enjoyed life more			2
" born @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity81 , to a homemaker and a man who made swimming pools , she got her first camera at age 8			2
she later changed her name to @entity88 , a nod to the airplane , which was appropriate for a woman who had a penchant for jumping out of planes , barefoot			0
she said she never aspired to be a photojournalist			2
rather her path , she explained , was mostly driven by a love of history and her desire to see it unfold firsthand			0
whether she was amid rioters after @entity102 's assassination or covering a long menu of wars spanning continents , @entity1 felt she and her colleagues were the lucky ones			1
" you could be a billionaire , and you could n't pay to do the things we 've done , " said @entity1 , who had most recently called @entity109 , @entity108 , home			1
reported to be @entity81 's first camerawoman , she came to the @entity115 and worked for @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity58 , for about seven years before moving to @entity0 in 1990			1
when other photojournalists dived behind cars as militiamen opened fire on protesters in @entity123 , @entity124 , she stood her ground and kept her camera running			0
as a band of medical professionals defied @entity130 tanks and armored vehicles , marching into then - @entity134 president @entity133 's compound in the @entity135 , she got in the middle of the group , joined them and helped nab an exclusive interview			0
when many around her slept in @entity40 , she set to work in a destroyed hotel room , filming with a night scope through holes blown out by artillery fire , hiding herself and camera from the eyes of snipers			1
the @entity149 sniper bullet that did hit @entity1 while she was traveling along " sniper alley " in @entity40 shattered her jaw , blew out her teeth and destroyed a portion of her tongue -- which left her forever sounding like she was drunk , she said			1
others got angry , as the van she traveled in was clearly marked as a press vehicle , but she refused to go there			0
" ' we came into their war			0
@entity163 's fair , ' " former @entity0 correspondent @entity161 , who was with her when she was shot , remembered her saying			1
" ' i do n't blame anyone for firing at me			0
they 're in a war , and i stepped into it			0
' " her attitude made other colleagues , many of whom were interviewed for the documentary " @entity172 : the @entity176 , " strive to be better at what they did			2
sound techs and correspondents would often follow her lead , whether they felt ready or not			0
she was known to outrun her own security			0
photojournalists viewed her as a bar - setter			0
another of @entity0 's international camerawomen remembers @entity1 @entity185 , @entity0 's chief international correspondent , who 'd been away from @entity40 when her friend was shot , was sitting at @entity1 's hospital bedside when an assignment editor from the international desk called			1
he wanted to know if @entity185 was ready to return to the conflict zone , she recalled for the documentary about @entity193			1
" i said i 'd go back , and i know to this day that if i had n't said yes then , i probably never would have gone back , and i never would have done this career			2
but i said yes because i could n't say no , " @entity185 remembered , fighting back tears			1
" we did the work for her			0
we did it because she was our champion , and we wanted to be her champion			0
" sure enough , as soon as @entity1 could carry a camera again , six months later , she went straight back to @entity40 to join her @entity0 colleagues			1
she joked that she was there to find her teeth			0
@entity1 maintained her humor amid madness and helped others smile and unwind when the surroundings could make levity seem impossible			1
she enlisted a producer to go rollerblading with her on the marble floors of a @entity213 , @entity214 , hotel lobby			0
she forced colleagues to tell her who they 'd rather sleep with , while giving them horrifying choices			0
she liked to kick back with fine cigars and could drink others under the table			2
despite her tough exterior , there was insecurity , a vanity to her			0
no matter where she was , @entity193 rose early to do her eye makeup and hair			0
forever worried about her weight , she picked at a block of cheese in @entity231 for about six weeks and got by on mango juice during a stretch in the @entity135			0
she admitted that after being shot , she was more afraid of what she 'd look like than she was of dying			2
enveloped in bandages , she slipped her dear friend @entity237 a note asking him if she looked like a monster			0
but she often worried about others more than herself			0
@entity1 enjoyed working with seasoned correspondents but also looked out for those who were new			1
in @entity242 , she taught @entity243 to sleep behind couches and talked her through everything she was shooting to help @entity243 build her stories			0
and in @entity248 , she carefully led the former @entity0 correspondent through rubble that probably hid land mines			1
" she took such incredible care of me and taught me so much , " @entity243 said			0
" i can honestly say that the work i did with @entity1 is still the very best work of my career			1
" moth repeatedly visited the doctor who saved her life			2
and she boosted the spirits and changed the attitude of another @entity0 photojournalist , @entity260 , when he was seriously injured by a bomb in @entity40 in 1995			1
" she made me realize that i was going to get through this , " he said			2
" she set an example by overcoming everything that 's happened to her			0
... i took that example , and i 'm shooting today			0
i 'm not sure that i would be doing what i 'm doing today if it had not been for @entity1			1
" her chosen lifestyle did n't leave room for children of her own , but she bonded with them across the globe			0
and her love of animals was so deep that she refused to ride in a horse - pulled wagon , preferring to run with heavy equipment in the desert heat while on assignment in @entity280 , @entity281			0
in fact , when it became clear that the advanced cancer would end her life , the concern that drove her to tears was her cats -- the more than 25 strays she looked after in @entity109			1
" she was more upset about them than she was about dying , " said @entity237 , who rushed to her side after she 'd been medevaced out of @entity40			1
but when @entity237 , also a @entity0 cameraman , moved into her home in @entity108 with the promise that he 'd care for the cats , he said @entity1 told him , " ' now i can die happy			1
' " @entity237 was by @entity1 's side when she died			1
he said he will be taking her ashes back to @entity109 , where he will place them in her garden , beside a photograph of her			2
there , as she wanted , she 'll be able to hang out with her cats			0
there were a few things @entity1 wished she had done			2
she would have liked to have seen the @entity306 , a medieval fortress in @entity308 , and the @entity310 drummers			0
but regrets ? she had none			0
she " led the complete life , " @entity185 said			1
" i do n't think @entity1 could ever look back and say , ' what if ? ' she did it to the max , and she did it brilliantly			1
and she did it on her terms			0
" @entity0 colleagues and friends of @entity1 contributed to this report .			1

her guts , skill and humor made @entity1 one to remember
the *longtime* @entity0 photojournalist dies of cancer at 59 , after surviving wars
shot in @entity40 , she lived and went back to conflict zone as soon as she could
@entity185 and others remember her for life she lived " to the max "
