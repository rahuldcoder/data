-- @entity2 pitcher @entity1 tossed the first no - hitter in the franchise 's history friday night in an 8 - 0 win over the @entity7			1
the @entity2 ' hometown crowd at @entity9 erupted after @entity1 rallied from a 3 - 0 count to strike out @entity7 third baseman @entity11 to end the game , and later when he was asked about making @entity2 ' history			2
" i 'm very happy , and happy for you guys -- finally the first one , " he told fans in an interview with @entity17 , which was covering the game			1
though he struck out eight batters , @entity1 was n't flawless , walking five in the course of tossing 134 pitches , only 77 for strikes , against the reigning @entity25 champions			2
and he got a few breaks -- including when the @entity7 ' @entity28 smacked a shot that appeared to hit the left - field chalk but was ruled foul , and when teammate @entity31 made a spectacular catch in left field in the seventh inning , slamming the wall so hard that he had to leave the game with an injured shoulder			0
@entity1 's feat was the third no - hitter of the 2012 @entity40 , following the @entity42 's @entity41 , who pitched a perfect game in april , and the @entity45 ' @entity44 last month			1
it is the first no - hitter by a @entity48 pitcher since the @entity50 ' @entity49 did it in the 2010 playoffs			2
the @entity2 have had their fair share of standout pitchers			0
@entity54 and @entity55 , for instance , played with the club and went on to throw no - hitters -- seven for @entity59 and one for @entity55 -- with other teams			0
friday night 's game means that only the @entity62 have never had a pitcher get through nine innings without allowing a hit			0
born in @entity66 , @entity1 won two @entity68 awards -- given to baseball 's best pitcher -- in 2004 and 2006 while with the @entity71			1
he came to the @entity2 in 2008 and had three solid seasons , but he underwent shoulder surgery , missed all of 2011 and came into 2012 as a question mark			0
@entity1 said friday 's game was his first no - hitter on any level			1
" i do n't even think i threw a no - hitter in video games , " he told reporters			1
" this was the first time i had the opportunity			0

@entity85 : " i do n't even think i threw a no - hitter in video games , " @entity1 says
the feat leaves the @entity62 as the only team without a no - hitter
" i 'm very happy , and happy for you guys -- finally the first one , " he says to @entity2 fans
@entity1 won two @entity68 as a @entity71 before coming to @entity98
