-- @entity1 and online privacy : for several years now , it 's been hard to talk about one without talking about the other			1
and @entity1 's latest offering , called home , is no exception			1
@entity8 is an @entity10 app that acts like a skin , updating the standard @entity10 mobile operating system with a more modern , @entity14 decor			0
the @entity10 home screen is replaced with a graphic version of the @entity1 news feed that automatically flips through the latest happenings from your friends			1
the phone 's home page has additional @entity1 features for posting to the site and communicating with friends			1
@entity8 is a more convenient way for heavy @entity1 users to use the social network 's services			1
it is also a more powerful tool for @entity1 to potentially collect information about a person , and it gives the company more ways and places to serve up ads. this is a tricky balancing act for @entity1 , which makes the majority of its revenue on advertising			1
knowing more information about a person means @entity1 can better target ads to them , and make more money			2
some pundits and privacy experts are already raising concerns about the potential for data grabs by @entity1			2
@entity52 of the site @entity54 says , " this application erodes any idea of privacy			0
if you install this , then it is very likely that @entity1 is going to be able to track your every move , and every little action			2
" and @entity63 , an activist with the @entity64 , told @entity65 : " they will get information about who you 're calling , how often , and how long you 're speaking to them			0
that 's a lot of information , and combined with the rest of your @entity1 communications , ( it ) could paint a very clear picture of your private life			2
" so what will be collected ? on a regular phone , @entity1 's data collecting powers are limited to what you do inside the official @entity1 mobile app or on the site in a browser			1
@entity8 frees @entity1 from that prison and gives it wider rein to collect more information about a person 's location , actions and communications			1
built - in gps technology means smartphones know where a person is at any given time			0
phones with @entity8 could access this information at any time to determine what businesses or neighborhoods you visit the most or even where you live			2
that data could then be used to serve up a more personalized ad , such as a coupon for a store you 're near or coffee shop you visit every sunday			0
a @entity1 representative told @entity0 that @entity8 will not actively track users ' gps location			1
in addition to any @entity1 messages or calls you already send or make , @entity8 pulls @entity120 text messages into the mix. who you talk to , when you talk to them and , in the case of text messages , what you talk about are possibly fertile grounds for data collection			1
third - party apps are also part of the @entity8 ecosystem , though in a somewhat limited way			2
" for a small randomized rolling subset of users , we will be collecting information ... around what applications you launch and when , " the @entity1 spokesman told @entity0 in an e-mail			2
" we do not collect any information about your activity within third - party apps			0
" people already willingly share much of this information with @entity1			0
but @entity8 , running in the background on your phone , will make it easier for the company to quietly collect data on everything you do			1
the difference is between actively sharing information -- uploading an image with location data , checking into a restaurant or other business -- and passively sharing it ( what the tech companies like to call " frictionless " sharing )			1
in other words , telling @entity1 where you are , who your friends are and what apps you like wo n't be optional , it will be automatic			0
@entity1 said home requires no new privacy controls and will respect all existing privacy settings			0
will @entity1 fans care ? @entity1 has long been plagued by privacy concerns over confusing privacy controls and data mining , but such worries do n't seem to have had any significant impact on its core users			1
a recent survey by the @entity179 found that 61 % of @entity1 users have taken a break from the social networking site , but only 4 % cited privacy concerns as a reason			0
@entity8 , which launches on april 12 , is n't being forced on anyone			0
downloading the app is entirely optional , as is buying a new @entity187 phone with home preinstalled			0
much of the outrage over past @entity1 privacy issues has been because they were mandatory and affected everyone			0
many of the @entity1 faithful may have resigned themselves to the idea that what they do on the site is tracked -- a fair enough exchange for a free service that keeps them in contact with friends , family and people they sort of knew in middle school .			0

@entity8 could give the company access to more of your personal data
things like a person 's location could be automatically collected in the background
@entity1 could also see who you call and text , and tell what apps you use and how often
the company says home will not actively track users ' gps locations
