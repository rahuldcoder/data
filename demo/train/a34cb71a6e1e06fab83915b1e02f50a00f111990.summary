-- @entity1 made movies , in the best sense of the word			1
some of them got poor reviews			0
some of them were burdened with sketchy scripts			0
but almost all of them -- from his first big hit , " @entity12 " ( 1986 ) to his most recent major release , " unstoppable " ( 2010 ) -- were entertaining , well - acted and smoothly polished examples of the motion picture art. @entity1 , who died in an apparent suicide sunday , was known for action , but what made his films distinctive was a feel for the human side of things			1
" take another look at ' @entity27 ' and check out the extraordinary chemistry @entity1 develops between ( @entity30 ) @entity29 and the young girl ( @entity31 ) he 's protecting , " wrote @entity25 's @entity24			1
" sure it has all the requisite action and violence we 've come to expect from a @entity1 film , but it also has a strong human dimension missing from a lot of films			1
" " he was one of the very few @entity44 action directors who could actually tell a story , " added @entity0 commenter @entity40			0
" ' @entity46 ' is the perfect example			0
' a highly underrated film			0
" coroner , director @entity1 's family dispute cancer report indeed , it was no accident that the same @entity1 who reveled in screaming planes , racing trains and hard - charging automobiles also produced the tv series " @entity64 " and " @entity65 " -- taut dramas with clever , layered roles -- as well as the character - driven films " @entity63 " ( 2007 ) , " in her shoes " ( 2005 ) and " @entity68 " ( 2002 )			1
the latter , an @entity71 film that starred @entity72 as @entity73 , won @entity74 , which he shared with brother @entity75 and others in their company , @entity77			0
@entity1 first got into film through his brother ; the two worked together in @entity75 's advertising shop , @entity75			1
even after his motion picture success , @entity1 still did commercials : among his recent outings were ads for @entity86 and @entity88 trucks			1
@entity1 made his feature directing debut with 1983 's " @entity90 , " a vampire film that got more attention in its time for its eroticism -- particularly a lesbian sex scene between stars @entity95 and @entity97 -- than its chills			2
@entity1 's feature career was slightly derailed -- " ( the studio ) saw a cut of ' @entity90 , ' and all of a sudden my parking spot at @entity105 was painted out ! " he said years later -- but he hit the big time with his next film : in 1986 , he directed " @entity12 , " which established @entity106 as an a-list star			1
not much was expected of the film in the beginning , he recalled			0
" nobody really quite understood what it was going to be , " @entity1 said , according to @entity111 's " blockbusting , " a history of top - grossing movies			1
" they thought it was going to be ' @entity90 ' on an aircraft carrier			0
" @entity1 turned out to be as aggressive as his high - flying characters			1
for one scene , according to " blockbusting , " the director wanted an aircraft carrier turned to catch the light in a certain way for five minutes			0
the move cost $ 25,000			0
@entity1 wrote out a check on the spot			2
" @entity12 " was roasted by critics , but @entity1 's technical work was praised			1
" the remarkable achievement in ' @entity12 ' is that it presents seven or eight aerial encounters that are so well choreographed that we can actually follow them most of the time , and the movie gives us a good secondhand sense of what it might be like to be in a dogfight , " wrote @entity132 , though he cautioned audiences to " look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another			2
" audiences did n't care ; the film 's sleek look and @entity151 atmosphere made it a box office smash			2
with $ 177 million in 1986 dollars , it was the no. 1 box office hit of the year			2
" @entity12 " also earned four @entity155 nominations -- with one win , " @entity158 's " best song nod -- and even boosted the sale of @entity161 sunglasses			2
his ensuing films ran the gamut of @entity44 forms : sequels ( " @entity173 " ) , remakes ( " the taking of @entity171 1 - 2 - 3 " ) , star - driven actioners ( " @entity46 , " with @entity29 and @entity170 , and " @entity172 , " with @entity169 and @entity170 ) and even tarantino-esque pulp ( " @entity49 , " @entity1 's best - reviewed film , which was based on @entity177 's first screenplay )			1
through it all , he brought a level of craftsmanship and professionalism to his work , earning praise from actors and colleagues			0
many took to @entity187 after his death , remembering him fondly			0
" @entity1 as a friend and a mentor was irreplaceable , " tweeted director and writer @entity190 ( " @entity191 " )			1
@entity1 made tense films for jittery times it 's no accident that @entity197 appeared in five @entity1 films -- the actor loved working with the director , as both were fond of immersing themselves in details and personalities			1
" one of the reasons i like working with @entity1 is because , like myself , he 's a research fanatic , " @entity197 said at a press conference for " @entity171 1 - 2 - 3			1
" " ( like him ) , i like being with the real folks			0
" @entity1 also enjoyed giving interviews , even those to promote his films -- the kind of wearying task that prompts actors and other directors to turn monosyllabic			2
@entity1 , on the other hand , used the opportunities to wax expansively on special effects , his more famous brother and even his place in the @entity44 hierarchy			2
perhaps he was n't as well - regarded as his @entity155 - winning sibling , he once observed , but things could change with time			1
" i always get criticized for style over content , unlike @entity75 's films like ' @entity227 ' or ' @entity228 ' or ' @entity229 ' that go right into the classic box right away			0
mine sort of hover , " he said			0
" maybe with time , people will start saying they should be classics , but i think i 'm always perceived as reaching too hard for difference , and difference does n't categorize you as the ' classic ' category			0
" maybe not , but when the lights went down , @entity1 gave you your money 's worth -- and then some			2
