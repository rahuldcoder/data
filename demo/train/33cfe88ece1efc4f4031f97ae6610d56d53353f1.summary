-- he may hate the attention off the track , but it 's hard to avoid the media glare when you 've been driving as well as @entity7 this season			1
the @entity9 is currently @entity11 's nearest rival in the @entity14 drivers ' championship , trailing @entity16 's triple world champion by 38 points thanks to a succession of star turns for his team @entity20			1
with a win in @entity22 and five second - place finishes so far this year , @entity7 will be seeking more podiums as @entity14 returns to action after a four - week summer break			1
this weekend , the 33 - year - old will be hunting down a fifth career win at the @entity30 @entity29 in @entity31 -- a track he told @entity14 was his " favorite place " and " the greatest racing circuit in the world			1
" since returning to the sport in 2012 , @entity7 has been a model of consistency finishing in the points a record 27 times in succession -- he overtook @entity43 's mark of 24 at the @entity44 @entity29 in june			1
" he 's driving better than he ever has , " @entity45 , associate editor of @entity46 , told @entity0			0
" that run of finishes is amazing because even if you are driving brilliantly , to have the luck as well , to have nothing break on the car			0
it 's a testament to @entity20 for building a car that is so reliable			1
" it 's a view which was recently echoed by @entity7 's team boss @entity56			1
" i would have to give @entity7 10 out of 10 , " @entity56 told @entity14			1
interactive : @entity58 circuit guide " he 's done a terrific job right from the beginning of the season and his remarkable run of 27 consecutive points finishes speaks for itself			1
no matter what happens he 's always there , as we saw in the final few laps at @entity71			0
" @entity7 scrapped his way to tenth place on the @entity74 and battled his way to ninth two weeks later in @entity76			1
but two podiums in the last three races before @entity58 's summer break have set him and @entity20 up nicely for the remaining nine races of the season			1
" he is playing a big part in pushing the team forwards , and of course having such a popular character in the seat has its advantages too , " @entity56 told @entity14			2
infographic : billion - dollar deals on wheels @entity56 is optimistic that he can keep hold of his star man despite other teams warming to the task of signing the " iceman " when his @entity20 contract expires later this year			1
@entity16 was considering @entity7 as replacement for @entity58 retiree @entity99 , but the @entity9 's manager @entity100 said monday that a deal could n't be reached			1
" the negotiations with @entity16 were not successful and ended some time ago , " @entity100 said , according to the @entity103 newspaper , @entity102			2
@entity106 's @entity105 is now widely tipped to take his @entity99 ' s place			1
@entity7 has also been linked with a return to @entity109 in recent days , according to another @entity103 newspaper , @entity110			2
but the claim has been denied by @entity109 and @entity45 thinks a move to @entity113 unlikely			0
" i just ca n't see him going back there after the way they parted last time , " @entity45 said			0
@entity7 , who won the world championship with @entity109 in 2007 , was released from his contract a year early in 2009 to make way for @entity121			1
of course , it may be that @entity7 opts to stay put			2
" the lotus team has one thing going for it in terms of pr and the media side of things			0
they do n't overwork @entity7 and he 's obviously very happy there , " @entity45 said			1
" there are all these things bubbling around about @entity20 ' financial situation and whether or not they can afford him			2
" but one thing @entity7 is n't really that motivated by is money			2
everyone is motivated by money to a certain extent but he 's not as bad as some of the other drivers			0
" the famously reticent @entity7 will no doubt be relieved to find the spotlight on @entity142 in @entity30 following his victory at the @entity144 @entity29 at the end of july			2
the @entity147 's maiden win for @entity148 has set up a potentially thrilling battle in the second half of the season			2
" it 's quite nicely poised			0
@entity11 pretty much looked on the way to his fourth world championship this year but now with @entity142 's win in @entity157 it 's suddenly up for grabs between the two , " @entity45 said			0
twelve months ago , @entity109 was providing the resistance , but @entity45 does n't see that happening this year			0
" they have lost quite a lot of ground with the front runners and i ca n't see them making that up			0
with the massive rules changes next year , unless you 're definitely in the title hunt most teams are going to switch their focus to 2014 much sooner than usual , " @entity45 said			0
" it 's still too early but you have to say it 's between @entity175 and @entity11 , i would have thought			0
" @entity142 currently lies fourth in the standings , 48 points behind championship leader @entity11 and will be hoping for a repeat run of 2010 when he took the checkered flag for his old team @entity180			0
" i wonder whether @entity148 has turned the corner ? " @entity45 asks			0
" you ca n't tell off the back of one race , but @entity142 was just untouchable			0
if they are very strong in @entity31 as well then you have to say that @entity142 has got every chance to catch @entity11 in the championship			0

@entity9 has only finished outside the top 10 once in 30 races since returning to @entity14 in 2012
the 33 - year - old will not replace @entity99 at @entity16 , according to @entity9 's manager
