-- " if something happens to @entity3 , i am willing to go to @entity4 to defend him			0
" these are fighting words , but not from a soldier			0
they are from @entity10 , a 35 - year - old publicist in @entity12 and supporter of the country 's opposition election candidate -- and loser of sunday 's contested presidential vote -- @entity3			1
her anger over the results of last sunday 's election is so great she now claims she will not have children in @entity12 , because they will not have what she describes as " a decent life			1
" why ? because , she said , she fears division			0
bitterly opposed to the government , she never voted for the late president @entity28 , who ran the country from 1999 to 2013 and whose death earlier this year triggered the election			1
she said she never believed in his policies			0
but despite the political discord , she wants a country that is united			2
she is one member of an opposition whose protests -- alongside counter-protests by government supporters -- have wracked the country 's streets since @entity41 , @entity28 's handpicked successor , apparently won sunday 's election with a razor - thin margin			1
opposition supporters allege the win was obtained through fraud , which fueled mass protest			1
at least eight people are reported to have died in post-election violence , state media said , while scores more have been injured			2
the government news agency said those killed were all followers of @entity41 , although @entity0 has not been able to confirm this			1
supporters of @entity3 have demanded a recount , and their pleas may be working			2
even though the government has strongly denied all fraud allegations , @entity12 's top election official said thursday that there will be an audit of 100 % of the votes cast in the election			1
official : @entity12 to audit 100 % of election results the decision came after a lengthy debate , said @entity71 , president of @entity12 's @entity72			1
officials have already audited 54 % of ballot boxes , and will now look at the remaining 46 % , she said			0
but is it too late ? @entity41 is set to be sworn in at a ceremony on friday and it is unclear whether the audit will affect the inauguration			1
also up in the air , is whether the streets of @entity12 cities will continue to ring with the sounds of protest			1
but who are the protesters -- and why are they so angry ? the triggers for the unrest are not hard to find			2
@entity12 's economy remains stagnant , with inflation predicted to hit an extraordinary 30 % this year , while food shortages continue despite the country sitting on massive ( and lucrative ) oil reserves			1
class is also a key issue in the tensions			0
support for @entity28 's socialist movement remains strong amongst the poor , who benefited from his programs			1
those who support @entity3 tend to come from more middle and aspirational working classes , for whom his message of day to day , bread - and - butter issues , such as jobs and crime , resonated			0
why is @entity12 so divided ? the gap between left and right , haves and have - nots in @entity12 has always been wide , but has increasingly become a gaping maw that has polarized society almost to the breaking point			1
@entity41 's evaporating 10 - point lead in pre-election polls seemed to indicate that enthusiasm for @entity28 's firebrand form of socialism was ending for some voters at least , and it seems the closeness of the results has emboldened opposition protesters to demand action			1
in @entity4 , the @entity12 capital , @entity3 supporter @entity123 hit the streets this week banging pots and pans in a " cacerolazo " demonstration -- literally " casserole " for the pots that are bashed -- until , he claims , pro-government supporters on motorbikes forced him to run for shelter			1
" this is not the first time i have participated in peaceful protests , i 've always opposed the government as i do with the current illegitimate government , " he said			0
fearing for his safety , he told @entity140 he plans to leave the country until the unrest dissipates			0
and the protests are not just contained in the capital			0
@entity145 , a 40 - year - old @entity12 from @entity146 , @entity147 , used to work as a tourist guide before the job died out along with the industry			2
now working a desk job , he blames policies adopted under the current and previous government for scaring tourists away			0
anger over his own situation , but also for what he feels are the millions of voices not being heard by the government , led him to support the opposition			0
" millions of @entity12 -- half of the electorate -- do n't share the ideology of the current government , " he said			2
there are " abuses of power that the government commits daily			0
we do n't have any type of justice			0
" protests have also spilled over into the expatriate @entity12 community			1
in @entity174 , @entity173 , 23 , who supports @entity3 , was stunned to see hundreds of protesters outside the @entity12 consulate in the city			1
@entity173 said the protesters were saying : " @entity3 is president , we want a recount			2
this is @entity12 not @entity182			2
" @entity28 's legacy in @entity12 opposition protesters say they have adhered to @entity3 ' exhortations to remain peaceful in their protests			1
@entity188 called off a rally after fears of violence , and both sides have urged their supporters to remain peaceful , while accusing the other side of fomenting unrest			0
not all protesters initially favored the opposition			2
@entity198 ­ a @entity199 , 27 , is a singer who lives in @entity201 © rida and who attended protests this week			0
she said she had previously had not considered herself a political person , and fell on neither the right nor left side of the political spectrum			0
however she has since taken to the streets			0
and with a 30 - day audit count ahead , @entity12 's future looks increasingly uncertain , with at least one side having no plans to back down			1
" i disagree with this government and the way it acted , " she said			0
" i am a person of values and , in this election , these values are being ignored			0

thousands hit the streets in @entity12 since sunday 's election
protesters want recount after @entity41 apparently wins presidency by small margin
protests reveal deep polarization in country where gap between rich and poor remains large
news of reported vote audit friday may *mollify* opposition supporters for a while
