while " the world has become a slightly happier and more generous place over the past five years , " economic and political upheavals have resulted in greatly reduced levels of well being for some nations , the report said			1
rankings for @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 fell dramatically because of the impact of the eurozone crisis , while @entity5 , @entity66 and @entity67 registered large falls in the wake of recent political and civil turmoil			2

on a scale of 1 to 10 -- with 10 rated as happiest -- @entity5 averaged 4.3 in 2012 , compared to 5.4 in 2007			2

" @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 experienced the largest increases across all the countries surveyed			2

reduced levels of corruption also contributed to the rise			0
governments seeking to improve the happiness of their populations should spend a higher proportion of their health budgets on mental illness , which is the single biggest " determinant of misery " in countries assessed , the study authors said			2
" people can be unhappy for many reasons -- from poverty to unemployment to family breakdown to physical illness , " the report said			0
" but in any particular society , chronic mental illness is a highly influential cause of misery			0
" if we want a happier world , we need a completely new deal on mental health			0
" @entity127 the 2013 @entity8 comes on the back of a growing global movement calling for governments and policy makers to reduce their emphasis on achieving economic growth and focus on policies that can improve people 's overall well - being			0
an idea first proposed in 1972 by @entity139 's former @entity138 , the concept of " happiness economics " has now gained traction in many countries across the world , including the @entity41 , @entity44 and @entity145			1
the @entity146 first encouraged member countries to measure and use the happiness of their people to guide public policies in july 2011			0
