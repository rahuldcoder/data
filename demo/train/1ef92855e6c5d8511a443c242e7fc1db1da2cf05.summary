-- this friday marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of @entity3 , one of history 's most notable figures			1
despite holding office for less than a full term , he has long been perceived by the @entity10 public as one of the best occupants of the @entity13			2
yet @entity3 's presidency is inspiring not just to @entity10 , but also to many others around the world too			1
and it offers key lessons for today , ranging from @entity10 policy in the @entity20 post- 9/11 , to how to best engage a " rising " @entity21			1
at a time when @entity10 - @entity25 rivalry was becoming heavily militarized , @entity3 's political genius was to appreciate that the superpower contest was as much a battle for ideas as strength of force			1
through his skilful rebalancing of hard and soft power , he powerfully renewed @entity10 global leadership , helping to thaw the @entity35			1
here his projection of hope and optimism , and stirring rhetoric appealed to @entity10 and international audiences alike , including those behind the @entity42			2
landmark speeches included the one he made in @entity45 in 1963 when he offered @entity10 solidarity with @entity47			2
and his desire to re-set @entity10 - @entity25 relations was expressed eloquently too , including a compelling speech at the @entity51 after the @entity52			2
this was described even by @entity25 premier @entity54 as the " the greatest speech by any @entity10 president since [ @entity58 ] @entity57			2
" renewal of @entity10 international policy was not just rhetorical , as initiatives like the @entity62 and the @entity64 - focused @entity63 underline			1
and , through landmark achievements such as the @entity66 , @entity3 gave substance to his ambition of moving toward international peace			2
to be sure , an objective appraisal of @entity3 's period in the @entity13 must highlight lows as well as the highs			1
in addition to successes such as his management of the @entity52 , there was also the @entity80 invasion debacle			0
and @entity3 had a much more limited record of legislative success than his successor @entity83			0
professional historians therefore tend to rate @entity3 's presidency as " good , " rather than " great , " with reason			1
of course , the circumstances of today are transformed from those of the early 1960s			0
as well as the end of the @entity35 , the @entity10 has experienced relative decline : for instance , its economy now accounts for less than a quarter of global gdp compared to around a third then			1
yet , the relevance of @entity3 's insights about international cooperation and peace endure			1
as does the wisdom of much of the way in which he harnessed @entity10 leadership and power to try to achieve these ends			2
indeed , at a time of @entity10 military cutbacks , and given the ongoing information revolution , the importance of achieving better balance between -- often expensive -- hard power assets and soft power resources is perhaps even more important today for @entity112			0
and this is true right across the world from @entity115 through the @entity20 and @entity64			0
on @entity21 policy , for instance , some @entity10 hawks advocate a much tougher stance toward @entity120			1
however , as @entity3 would have recognized , @entity112 has much to gain from cooperation with @entity120 too , and it would be a mistake to view the relationship solely through a lens of threat and suspicion			0
to be sure , there remains a legitimate remaining need for maintaining significant @entity10 military power in @entity115 , not least to re-assure key allies			0
however , on issues ranging from @entity132 , terrorism , through to the future stability of the global economy , @entity21 has a potentially key role to play in concert with the @entity10			1
here the role of soft power is key as @entity112 seeks to better integrate @entity120 into a network of regional and global institutions and alliances			0
in so doing , this will help incentivize @entity21 even more strongly toward a path of constructive partnership			0
in the @entity20 meanwhile , @entity10 standing in numerous countries has unfortunately been at a low ebb now for at least a decade			1
only 11 % of the population in @entity150 , 14 % in @entity151 , 16 % in @entity152 and the @entity154 territories , and 21 % in @entity155 , currently have favourable views toward the @entity10 , according to @entity157			0
despite some @entity10 overtures , the challenge remains monumental			0
this is such a critical issue given the wide - range of @entity10 priorities in @entity20 and other muslim - majority countries , including the " campaign against terrorism			1
" as @entity3 would surely have appreciated , there is a compelling need for redoubling efforts to win the battle for moderate " hearts and minds			0
" this can be best achieved through a vigorous re-assertion of @entity10 soft power , combined with prudent use of hard power			0
such an agenda would require much greater resourcing for activities such as public diplomacy , broadcasting , development assistance and exchange programs			0
@entity10 public diplomacy is in particularly strong need of revitalization , with a clearer long - term strategy essential			2
taken overall , it is clear that @entity3 's key insights about international relations retain much relevance and appeal			1
and for this reason alone , his presidency will continue to hold not just enduring value , but also inspiration , right across the world for many years to come			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0
