@entity0 -- backers of a comprehensive new farm bill held a campaign - style rally wednesday on @entity5 , cranking up the political heat on @entity9 @entity8 leaders struggling to balance competing election year and ideological pressures			1
" all of us gathered here today ... share one common and resounding message , " said @entity12 , head of the @entity13			2
" @entity20 , for our farm and ranch families , their communities and for our nation , pass the farm bill now			1
" @entity12 was cheered by a boisterous crowd at the @entity23			2
" we are out here to let our congressmen know it is important that they pass the farm bill , " @entity24 , an independent voter from @entity25 , told @entity1			1
... knowing that we do n't know what to do or what to plan for is very difficult			0
" the driest season : global drought causes major worries @entity9 majority leader @entity36 , @entity37 , told @entity1 the @entity9 @entity8 leadership is still " working with the @entity39 to see what can be done			1
" he conceded , however , that the " timing is definitely short			0
" @entity42 , a spokesman for @entity9 speaker @entity43 , @entity44 , said he hopes the @entity39 will pass a livestock disaster aid bill previously approved by the @entity9			1
he stressed that " we are still discussing options on a farm bill extension			1
" the current five - year law establishing various levels of federal support for drought - stricken farmers and ranchers expires september 30			0
while the @entity55 - run @entity39 passed a $ 969 billion replacement bill in june through a rare bipartisan 64 - 35 vote , numerous conservatives in the @entity8 - controlled @entity9 have balked at the overall price tag and spiraling cost of food stamps included in the measure			1
" for conservatives like myself ... the real concern ( is ) that what is now a farm bill is really not that			1
it 's a food stamp bill , " said rep. @entity67 , @entity68			2
@entity70 in tight political races this fall , however , are pushing hard for quick legislative action on a more traditional comprehensive deal			2
@entity75 rep. @entity74 , a freshman @entity9 @entity8 seeking to replace retiring @entity55 sen. @entity76 , said wednesday his message to the @entity9 @entity8 leadership is simple : get it done			1
" we 've got to get this done , " @entity74 told @entity1			0
" this is what 's wrong with @entity0			0
" @entity74 refused to speculate about possible repercussions for his campaign if the @entity9 fails to act			2
@entity86 : why is @entity20 so good at kicking the can down the road ? " this is about the farmers and ranchers in @entity75 , " he said			0
" the last thing we need to do is create this cloud of uncertainty that will happen if we do n't get a long - term farm bill done			1
" the congressman expressed optimism that the @entity9 will be able to act over the next few weeks			2
" in the legislative process they work best under deadline , and so i just think we need to keep pushing right now , " he said			0
@entity105 rep. @entity104 , a first - term @entity8 , told reporters at the rally she is " disappointed " that @entity9 @entity109 leaders have n't scheduled a floor vote on another five - year bill approved by the @entity112			1
the committee 's bill is broadly similar to the @entity39 plan			2
" that has been a big disappointment for me , " she said			0
@entity104 and rep. @entity118 , @entity119 , sent a letter to @entity36 on wednesday requesting a meeting to discuss the possibility of bringing a bill to the @entity9 floor for a vote by the full chamber			1
" whether members support or oppose the farm bill , we believe the @entity9 should be allowed to vote so that we can be held accountable to those we represent , " the letter said			1
while the @entity9 has supported short - term drought disaster relief , several prominent @entity55 and @entity8 have expressed concern about the economic fallout that may accompany a failure to enact a new long - term deal			1
" if the farm bill is allowed to expire and things begin to unwind , we turn back the clock in rural @entity144 , " said @entity138 @entity55 sen. @entity137 , head of the @entity139 and primary author of the @entity39 plan			1
agricultural markets , @entity137 declared at the rally , would be in " disarray " without a comprehensive new law			2
" it 's absolutely crazy to even get close to something " like that scenario , she said			0
@entity153 rep. @entity152 , the top @entity154 on the @entity112 , told the crowd more grassroots pressure will be needed in order to force the @entity109 leadership 's hand before the end of the current @entity20			0
so far " the groundswell is not out there , " he warned			0
" this rally is a good starting point but what we need , what is going to change this , we need 100 or 200 calls from people in their districts to these members			2
that 's what is going to change this			0
" " if you do n't do that , we 're not going to get a farm bill , " he said			1
" it 's that simple			0
" a number of conservative leaders want to wait until after the november election , at which point they hope full @entity8 control of @entity20 and the @entity186 will allow them to draft a bill more in line with their ideological preferences			2
farmer : ' it was the system that failed us ' rep. @entity195 , @entity196 , argued wednesday that @entity20 " should n't be subsidizing any product			0
" " it has nothing to do with how much they 're making or not making , " he said at the panel discussion with @entity67			0
" prices convey an enormous wealth of information that is absolutely essential to consumers to make rational decisions in the marketplace			0
" for their part , top @entity39 @entity8 have indicated support for a short - term extension if the @entity39 's five - year bill ca n't get through the @entity9			1
" i represent a state in which agriculture is important , " senate minority leader @entity212 , @entity213 , said tuesday			0
" i do n't believe that we ought to let the current farm bill expire if we 're unable to at this point to pass a replacement			1
" the head of the @entity112 , @entity109 rep. @entity221 , told @entity1 on wednesday " there 's a growing probability " that a one - year extension is " the most practical thing			0
" " i believe some kind of action will happen before we go home ( for the campaign ) , and it 's my intent to help to make it happen , " he said			0
" something has to happen			0
" farm bill fight escalates ahead of deadline @entity1 's @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report			1
