the failure of medical services has forced doctors to turn away pregnant women and the sick			0
and with a cholera epidemic sweeping through the capital city of @entity0 and surrounding areas , medical officials say they fear they will be faced with hundreds of normally preventable deaths in the coming days			1
the four main hospitals in @entity0 have stopped admitting patients because of a medicine shortage , said the @entity29			1
another hospital in the second largest city of @entity32 -- 439 km ( 272 miles ) from @entity0 -- is facing a similar shortage			1
" sick people in need of attention are being turned away , " the group said			0
in many hospitals , maternity services have been scaled back -- meaning women who need to deliver babies by caesarian section " will needlessly die during childbirth , " it said			0
the hospitals , like everything else in the country , are a victim of the country 's collapsing economy under president @entity52 , the group said			1
meanwhile , the @entity1 government has asked a group headed by former @entity56 chief @entity55 to postpone a visit meant to highlight the country 's humanitarian crisis , calling it a " partisan " attempt to boost the opposition			1
@entity55 was set to arrive in @entity1 this weekend with former @entity63 president @entity62 and rights activist @entity64 , wife of former @entity6 president @entity65			1
the trio wanted to find ways to ease the plight of @entity1 , nearly half of whom are in need of emergency food aid			2
but the state - owned daily newspaper , @entity73 , says the three -- who belong to a group of senior statesmen known as the @entity77 -- were trying to boost the opposition party , the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) , in power - sharing talks with @entity52			1

independent analysts put the figure in billions			0
doctors and nurses are reluctant to come to work because of the poor pay and poor equipment			0
those who can are leaving @entity1 for neighboring countries or to @entity95 and @entity96 , the group said			1
the group held @entity52 's government responsible for the cholera epidemic that broke out early last month in the capital city and has since spread to other parts of the country			1
the government has not been able to dispose of sewage properly , nor has it been able to provide chemicals to treat water to make it potable , the group said			0
residents are " surrounded by flowing raw sewage , " and many have been forced to resort to drink contaminated water from rivers , the group said			0
the pandemic , it said , " has caused hundreds of preventable deaths			0
" the government has not released official figures of cholera - related death			2

the country 's health ministry insists the disease has been contained			0

non-governmental aid groups are providing water and water purification tablets to the most affected communities			0
but they can not reach everyone			0
the government should declare the cholera outbreak a national disaster and solicit international assistance , the group said			2
" definitely the government is not capable , " said dr. @entity152 , who is part of the doctors ' group			2
" it does not have the capacity to control the spread of cholera or to put a stop to it at the moment			0
