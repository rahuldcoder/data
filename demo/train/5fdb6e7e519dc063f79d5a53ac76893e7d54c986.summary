-- his first act as a teenage professional goalkeeper was to pick the ball out of the back of the net			2
but it would not take long before the football world was in the palm of @entity11 's hands			1
" i was a baby in the goal , " @entity11 tells @entity0 's @entity13 series of his heroics for @entity15 at the @entity16 in @entity17			1
" the goalkeeper usually joins the national team at the mid-twenties , the late twenties , even over the 30s maybe			2
" i was very , very lucky to have the confidence of @entity24 our coach in 1990			2
" @entity11 , aged just 23 , became the youngest goalkeeper to win the @entity16			1
he more than justified @entity24 's belief in him as he famously denied @entity28 in a semifinal penalty shootout and then became the first goalie to keep a clean sheet in a @entity16 final as the @entity33 beat defending champion @entity35 1 - 0			1
captain of that victorious team was @entity38 -- the player who had fired a penalty past @entity11 earlier when the 18 - year - old came on as a substitute for @entity42 in a @entity44 clash with titleholder @entity45			1
the man he replaced that day in february 1986 , @entity48 , was twice a losing @entity16 finalist for @entity15 -- but @entity11 would not suffer such a fate			1
a roman triumph after waltzing through the group stages of @entity16 , @entity15 would see off the @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity28 before marching on to the final at the @entity55 in @entity56 for a rematch of the 1986 final			1
" it was tremendous , a tremendous @entity16 , " @entity11 recalls			1
" @entity17 is close to @entity15 , so you can imagine that thousands of @entity33 fans were			1
all along the streets when we were going to the games			2
" everything worked out perfectly , the atmosphere in the team was great , motivation was great , the coach did well			2
we had our freedom and we played very well and won it			2
" legends were made that famous night in the @entity17 capital , but @entity74 had already etched his name into national folklore			0
a crucial penalty save from @entity28 's @entity78 in the semis helped the @entity33 to advance to a third successive final in the most tense circumstances			1
he then recorded the first final shutout since the tournament began in 1930 as a late @entity86 penalty gave @entity15 a third title overall			2
" i was just happy that we won this game , " @entity74 says modestly when reminded of his exploits			0
" i could n't care less if it was 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , nothing			0
i was just happy to hold this big and heavy trophy in my hand in the match against @entity35			0
" in fact , @entity74 recalls the final as one of his easiest games in the tournament			2
that 's despite @entity103 's side containing @entity104 , arguably one of the finest players to ever play the game and a key figure in the 1986 tournament			0
" i could n't see @entity104 in that game , he did not even try a shot on my goal so i had a pretty easy job in that final , " @entity74 says			2
" i think i only touched it once or twice			0
we did a great defensive job of course but @entity104 was the danger for us			0
" lucky for us we had @entity118 , who played one to one against him			0
" @entity15 had witnessed the fall of the @entity120 less than a year before the 1990 final and the reunited country still had a feelgood factor from those momentous events			2
when the players returned they were swamped by well - wishers as they paraded through the streets of @entity127			2
" the homecoming after the @entity16 was almost as mad as going to each of the games , " @entity74 recalls			1
" i do n't know how many million people were around the streets but it was exceptional			0
" @entity74 had watched on television the last time @entity15 won the @entity16 back in 1974 but he never thought he would be able to replicate the feats of legends like @entity24 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
four years later , however , the @entity16 of @entity140 ' 94 would bring @entity74 and his countrymen back down to earth			1
a unified @entity15 team , featuring many of the 1990 side as well as those who would have previously qualified for @entity147 , suffered a surprise 2 - 1 quarterfinal defeat at the hands of @entity151			2
" the @entity16 was a tremendous success and it was a very nice experience ( but ) ' 94 was not nice , not the same good experience within the team , with the coach , " @entity11 says			1
" so i was very frustrated about how things were going during this @entity16			1
" everybody was more motivated to play against us			0
our team spirit was not the same as four years previous and we had a different coach by then			2
players got older , they were at the end of their career			0
" the defeat marked @entity74 's 54th and last appearance for @entity15 as he retired from international football after the tournament aged just 27			0
" i planned it to step down at the @entity16 ( as a ) winner again but it did not work out like that , " he says			1
" maybe the biggest regret i have was to resign right after we lost in ' 94 against @entity151			0
now i think i should have waited a little bit longer and think it over			0
i could have played another @entity16 or even more international games			1
" @entity15 would bounce back to win the @entity177 in @entity28 two years later but @entity74 's focus was elsewhere by then			1
named @entity180 goalkeeper of the year in 1991 and @entity15 's top stopper from 1989 - 93 , he had become hot property			1
as his compatriots walked the famous @entity185 steps to lift the @entity187 trophy , @entity74 was in @entity188 finalizing a move from @entity42 to @entity190 -- a club more known for spending big on the world 's best attacking players			1
" it was a tremendous success for me that one of the biggest clubs , @entity190 , asked for my services -- and i was more than happy to sign for them , " he says			1
" they came out of a very poor season , signed a lot of new players , brought in a new coach @entity203 , who wanted me as his goalkeeper and we had a fantastic season			2
" i had to fight hard with two @entity188 goalkeepers to get in there , but in the end it was worth it			0
" at @entity42 , @entity74 had come close to winning titles but his side never finished higher than second in the league			0
his debut season ended with @entity42 just avoiding relegation			0
in @entity190 , winning was the only option			1
@entity219 was equivalent to being the first loser			0
with @entity74 in their ranks , @entity190 would win @entity222 twice , as well as two @entity223 crowns ( although the keeper was an unused substitute for the second of these wins in 2001 )			1
" i enjoyed my time at @entity190 with @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232			1
it was fantastic , " he says			0
" i enjoyed to be with these players with this quality and nice , nice lads ... i enjoyed it very much			0
" behind the mike today , @entity74 is still involved in football although he has turned his hand to commentary at @entity244 broadcaster @entity242			0
forthright in his opinions and insightful with his analysis , the transition from the pitch to the television screen has been a seamless one			0
@entity74 regularly covers the @entity188 , @entity17 and @entity33 leagues for his employer and he feels more qualified than most to offer predictions on who to watch out for in the @entity254 in @entity255 starting next month			1
" in @entity255 , they expect to win this @entity16 and that can weigh on your shoulders of course			1
we have to see how they deal with it , but i think they are the big favorites , " he says			0
" there 's another three or four favorites			0
@entity15 of course , @entity188 of course as a @entity16 winner ( in 2010 ) and the dark horse might be @entity271 or @entity272			1
" @entity103 , not to forget with @entity274 , they have a very good strikers upfront and are very dangerous as well			0
" unsurprisingly , @entity11 will be rooting for his compatriots			1
" we 've seen a very solid and very good @entity33 team since @entity15 played at home at the @entity16 in the 2006 , " he says			1
" fantastic football , different to the football that we are used to in @entity15			0
" we played with a lot of heart , there was a lot of power , but from 2006 on we played with a lot of technique , with a lot of spirit as well			0
" this generation needs a title and i think it 's the last chance			0
some players are getting old now			0
@entity295 is one of the best players on the right - back side , he 's 30			2
" @entity298 is one of the most talented players and he 's still young , he can do more @entity300 , but @entity301 for example , in midfield , 30 almost as well			0
" this team is getting old -- if they want to get a title it needs to be this season			0
" if @entity309 's @entity33 team of 2014 are looking for advice , they could do worse than taking a tip or two from this @entity16 winner behind the mike .			1
