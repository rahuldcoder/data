-- they had only played one competitive match of the new season but already the knives were out at @entity5			2
despite boasting of the financial muscle at their disposal they had failed to sign one player or spend a single pound before the new @entity13 campaign kicked off			0
and when they were beaten at home on saturday by @entity17 -- who narrowly avoided relegation last season -- a predictably poisonous atmosphere resulted			0
fans vented their fury not only at their under - performing stars but also manager @entity24 , and especially the board , for the lack of new faces			2
but @entity24 's beleaguered squad lifted the storm clouds , for now at least , with a decisive 3 - 0 victory over @entity31 in the first leg of a critical @entity34 playoff wednesday			1
entry to the lucrative competition was seen as vital if they are to attract some big - name signings before the transfer window shuts on september 2			0
and @entity5 made light work of their assignment in the @entity43 city of @entity44 , as goals from @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 all but sealed their progress			1
in truth , @entity5 were far superior to @entity31 , who could have be expelled from the competition even if they were to progress in the tie			1
the @entity43 are awaiting the outcome of an appeal to the @entity56 challenging a ban from @entity59 competition handed down to them by @entity61 on match - fixing charges			2
but after @entity46 turned home a cross from @entity67 international @entity66 on 51 minutes @entity31 's threat was limited			1
@entity47 doubled the @entity69 ' lead with a powerful strike from outside the area and @entity48 converted a late penalty after @entity66 was adjudged to have been brought down in the area			1
after the game @entity24 told @entity75 : " we could have be a little bit shaky after what happened on saturday so it was important to start on the right foot			2
" as for the possibility of making some signings before the transfer window shuts he added : " a lot will happen in the last ten days			0
" elsewhere , @entity85 side @entity84 , who were reinstated to the competition after @entity89 @entity88 were thrown out on match - fixing charges , drew 1 - 1 with @entity91 in @entity92			1
@entity94 's equalizer helped @entity96 side @entity95 to a 1 - 1 draw with @entity98 in @entity99 while @entity100 won 2 - 0 away at @entity101 in @entity102			1
two goals from @entity104 helped @entity106 club @entity105 to a 4 - 2 victory over @entity108 in @entity109			0
in the @entity13 , @entity110 made it two wins from two games as @entity113 beat @entity17 in a controversial clash at @entity115			1
the home side took the lead when @entity119 's shot cannoned off @entity17 's @entity121 goalkeeper @entity120 and into @entity122 , propelling the ball over the line			0
but @entity17 equalized when @entity126 international @entity125 grabbed his third goal of the season , finishing a smart move at the near post			0
@entity131 was perhaps fortunate not be sent off when he appeared to elbow @entity125 and he proved to be the match winner , heading @entity134 's free kick home with 17 minutes left			0
after the game @entity110 told reporters : " that was very hard , i 've missed that about the @entity13			1
this is what i like			0
@entity17 probably deserved a point			0

@entity5 beat @entity31 3 - 0 in their @entity34 playoff tie first leg
goals from @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 seal win in @entity43
*respite* for @entity24 after *defeat* in first @entity13 game
@entity113 beat @entity17 2 - 1 as @entity110 makes it two wins from two
