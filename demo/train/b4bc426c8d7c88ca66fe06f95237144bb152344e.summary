-- the @entity1 is known for a certain kind of escapist fun			1
saturday nights are reserved for their original movies : movies that are lower - budget than the fare seen in theaters , but still meet science fiction fans ' need for fantastic monsters , time travel and magic			1
with a reputation for being delightfully campy , @entity1 's original movies are a guilty pleasure , said @entity16 , star of @entity1 's original series , " @entity18			1
" " within the bandwith of the campy sci - fi movie , you can go from completely self - aware , with something like [ classic sci - fi movie ] ' @entity24 , ' and then in the middle you have something like [ the @entity1 movie ] ' @entity28 , ' where the creature is just way over the top , sort of on purpose , " @entity16 said			1
" and on the other end you have sort of the more realistic version of the campy creature , like ' @entity36 , ' " he added			1
" @entity36 , " is @entity16 's @entity1 original movie directorial debut and will air saturday , november 27 , at 9 p.m. et. the movie is about the fossilized remains of dinosaurs that are brought back to life by a @entity43 spell and urged to wreak havoc on a small town			1
the ravenous , animated skeletons start eating as many people as they can			0
however , because the resurrected dinosaurs are only bones , they have no digestive organs			0
so their human meals just drop to the ground after mastication			0
" i 'd describe it as , ' what happens when a flying tyrannosaurus rex attacks @entity59 ? ' " said @entity16			0
" @entity60 , no doubt ! " the movie 's tagline reads , " they 're ancient , they 're angry and they 're out for revenge			2
" based on that description , @entity72 , " @entity73 " writer and current member of " @entity70 " said it could be a perfect addition to his movie riffing routine			2
" i guess the central dilemma of the movie is the digestive system of these monsters			0
... is @entity82 or @entity83 doing a sponsor ? " he said			0
" who could not watch a movie with that description ? " @entity72 has made a living out of lovingly poking fun at campy , b - grade movies			1
he said the reason so many people love campy films is because of their originality and filmmakers ' resourcefulness			0
" the best of them have a real personality that comes through that you do n't necessarily see in a big - budget movie , " @entity72 said			0
big - budget science fiction movies tend to rely more on a constant barrage of noise and shiny objects instead of the charm of a campy filmmaker , like @entity109 , he said			2
" in some ways [ ' @entity36 ] ' could be a cheesy b movie , and in some ways it could be an action / adventure sci - fi movie , " said @entity110 , co-founder of the production company behind " @entity36 , " @entity112			1
" we make fun movies with a lot of visual effects and a lot of action , and there 's this huge fan base for them , " he said			1
" anytime i 'm out and about and people ask me what i do , i say , ' oh i make the movies for the @entity1 , ' and people are like , ' oh ! i love those things ! ' anyone from a hairdresser to a guy in a grocery store , guy parking the car			1
i think it 's really a wide spectrum of viewers for these movies , and i think the age range also varies very much , too			1
" " @entity1 is filling a void , " @entity16 said			2
" people used to go to drive - ins to see these kinds of movies			0
" there 's something about cheap entertainment that makes people smile , he said			0
@entity147 , the executive vice president of programming and original movies at @entity1 , said the movie " @entity28 " made everyone on his team smile			1
even saying the word " @entity28 " was fun , he said			0
" we create this world that 's outlandish -- we create this world where ' @entity28 ' really exists , where the military creates a sharktopus and the sharktopus gets loose , " @entity147 said			2
" once you set that up , everything that follows has to live within that world and has to make logical sense based on the outlandish premise that we 've created			1
" another recent @entity1 movie , " @entity168 , " starring sci - fi fan favorite @entity167 , applies that logic to the fairy tale " @entity171			1
" @entity147 said it was an easy leap to go from " a story that 's about a little girl and a talking wolf , " to an original movie that was about how a modern girl would deal with the sci - fi version of a talking wolf -- a werewolf			1
with such attention to detail and adherence to a fantastic story line , @entity147 said it 's no surprise that @entity1 's original movie team is made up of sci - fi geeks			1
" everything at @entity1 is run by robots , actually , " said @entity188 , vice president of original movies at @entity1			1
" we 're all fans of the genre , we all consume a lot of science fiction , fantasy and supernatural programming , " @entity147 said			0
" first and foremost , we are entertainment junkies			0
when i was a kid , the one thing my parents were always on me about was to turn off the tv			0
" and while it 's clear the creative team at @entity1 knows what traditional sci - fi fans want in terms of continuity and premise , @entity16 said he believes the network is reaching out to a more mainstream audience			2
" with the creation of [ original @entity1 series ] ' @entity18 ' and ' @entity215 , ' it was like , ' no space , no aliens , ' sort of grander science - type stuff			2
at the same time you had the mainstream [ audience ] getting more technical , more savvy , more sort of geeky , " @entity16 said			0
" everyone is talking about iphones and @entity225 and knows about e-mailing this and @entity227 and @entity228 directly , " he added			0
" it 's all very sci - fi anyway in our world			0
so i think modern culture and technology sort of moved towards sci - fi , and @entity1 tried to meet them half - way			2
" for now , thankfully , man - eating dinosaur skeletons are still squarely in the realm of outlandish camp .			0
