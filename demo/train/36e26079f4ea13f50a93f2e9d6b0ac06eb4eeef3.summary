-- a long time ago a great three - time governor of @entity2 , @entity3 , said about @entity4 , the two - time not very good governor of @entity2 , " you could n't wake up @entity4 with an earthquake			1
" as i go around the country and see various @entity9 and talk to them on the phone , honestly i 'm beginning to think that we have become the party of @entity4			2
my message is simple : @entity15			2
translated -- wake the you - know - what up , there is an earthquake			2
you think that @entity9 around the country are going to win -- as i hear time and time again from people on the street			2
@entity9 fundraisers , activists , supporters , and even politicians alike have somehow collectively lapsed into the sentiment that the president is going to be reelected and that we have a good shot to take the @entity32 back while holding the @entity33			2
i ask : what are you smoking ? what are you drinking ? what are you snorting or just what in the hell are you thinking ? look around the world -- do you see any governments or incumbents winning any elections out there ? did it happen in small elections in @entity46 or @entity47 , big elections in @entity49 and @entity50 or how about huge elections in the @entity52 in 2008 and 2010 ? please folks -- wake up ! the polling ? not that encouraging			1
the latest @entity56 poll was 47 - 47			0
the @entity58 average of polls has the president up a whopping three - tenths of a percentage point			1
and i am hearing the garbage that @entity9 donors are telling @entity9 fundraisers ... " @entity67 has it in the bag			0
" newsflash : nothing is in the bag			0
nothing can be taken for granted			0
everybody from the precinct door - knocker , to the @entity77 high command , to the @entity32 , to the halls of @entity79 , to the @entity33 and @entity32 committees , to congressional leadership , here is a simple message : if we do n't get on the offense , reconnect with the @entity52 people , talk about how the middle class is in a struggle for its very existence , hold the @entity89 accountable and fight like the dickens , we are going to lose			1
you can shoot five @entity92 , you can save 10,000 banks and 20 car companies , even pass the most sweeping legislation in modern @entity52 history ; if people do n't think that you are connected to their lives and are fighting for their interests they will vote your tush out of office in a nano - second			1
for historical reference see @entity105 election of 1945 and president @entity106 in 1992			0
so , fellow @entity9 -- we 've got a fight on our hands			0
we 've got to fight in the same way that the people we care most about have fought for quite some time			0
they have been crushed by high health care costs , soaring education costs , stagnant wages and financial bailouts for irresponsible firms			0
combine all of this with the fact that the @entity89 are raising not millions , not tens of millions , but potentially hundreds of millions of dollars from the pollution industry as result of @entity121 v. @entity122			0
there is a full - fledged legislative agenda in many states to keep democrats from even voting			1
we are literally being attacked from every side while simultaneously being lulled into some self - induced stupor thinking that this thing is somehow in the bag			0
oh i know what you are going to say , " look at @entity135 , look how pathetic he is ... " actually pathetic is a kind word for @entity135 and this campaign			1
@entity135 is to presidential campaigns as the @entity140 grade point average was to @entity141 -- the worst in history			1
i mean , my @entity143 , when you hold a press conference to rebut charges that you have a @entity148 mentality and then you have foreign policy " experts " talk about @entity152 and the @entity153 in " contemporary " terms -- really ? i know that the @entity156 and @entity157 bank accounts drive swing voters and independents over the edge			1
i 've gotten all of the reports from focus group moderators as to how devastating this is to @entity135			1
why a man who knows he is running for president ( who claims to know something about the @entity52 economy ) would for any reason keep money in offshore accounts , i have no idea			2
and i know that we are going to take him out to the cornfield ( like at the end of the movie " casino " ) on the @entity180 budget			0
however , i fear that all of this will not be enough unless we have a real change of attitude about the difficult campaign ahead of us			0
it has been said that , " nothing so focuses a man 's attention as the prospect of being hanged			0
" look around @entity9 -- come november let 's make sure that it 's @entity135 and his bunch at the end of that figurative rope and not us			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

@entity199 : democrats are expressing *confidence* they will beat @entity135 easily
he says the polls show the race is *extremely* close ; incumbents losing around world
*touting* *accomplishments* such as *killing* @entity211 , saving @entity212 wo n't do the trick , he says
@entity199 : democrats must connect with voters ' worries about the economy
