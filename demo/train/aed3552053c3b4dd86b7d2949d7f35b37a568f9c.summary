-- in 1950 , the world 's population was 2.5 billion people			0
today , it is over 7 billion			0
by 2050 , it will be nearly 10 billion			0
this explosive growth has put huge strains on our natural resources , but at the same time it has helped create conditions for an unprecedented period of global economic growth , which has seen billions lifted out of poverty			1
the financial future we face today is uncertain			0
most people think global growth will average 3 % per year for the foreseeable future , as opposed to 5 % before the global economic crisis			1
this means that it will take 25 years for the economy to double in size -- 10 years longer than it would if it was humming along at its pre-crisis rate			2
what does this mean ? a future of diminished expectations and increased uncertainties poses profound challenges			0
considering we already live in a world where hundreds of millions of people are either unemployed or struggling to make ends meet on the fringes of the formal economy , this can not be underestimated			2
but i also believe these challenges focus our minds on long - term solutions that will ultimately make our world a fairer , more prosperous , better place to live			0
the only way forward is to unlock the talent that 's within all of us			2
youth unemployment we 've become used to headlines chronicling the dire state of youth employment around the world			0
average global unemployment is around 13 % , but the figure is twice as high -- and then some -- in parts of @entity54 , the @entity55 and @entity56			0
it does n't need to be this way			0
smarter school and university curricula and a higher focus on relevant skills -- helped by technology and the democratizing power of the @entity65 -- will allow young people to equip themselves for success in a competitive global marketplace , just as technology renders other jobs obsolete			1
talent is as important today as capital when it comes to defining a country 's economic competitiveness , and we 're getting better at harnessing this			1
in @entity54 , for example , eight out of 10 jobs created since 2008 were in small and medium - sized businesses			2
by getting the public and private sectors working together with academia , this flowering of talent can truly flourish , and become our economies ' new growth champions			1
gender equality but you can only unlock talent if you pay equal attention to both halves of the population			1
gender equality is n't just about human rights -- it makes cold , hard economic sense			1
creating genuine equality in the workforce from the boardroom down will have a transformational effect on many economies			1
it 's been suggested that the @entity102 economy could grow by as much as 5 % if there were true economic equality between both halves of the population			1
@entity107 's could grow further , by as much as 9 %			0
no economy wants to miss out on that kind of growth			1
this is why president @entity112 announced at @entity113 in 2014 that he wanted 30 % of all senior managerial positions in his country to be held by women by 2020			0
he wo n't be the last to make such promises			0
leaving no one behind is key			2
we live in a diverse world and those economies that respect their most gifted people -- regardless of who they are -- will be the ones that will ultimately succeed in underwriting their future prosperity			0
the benefits of the silver workforce at the @entity131 , we set so much store in countries ' ability to attract and retain talent that it forms an integral part in our annual assessment of global competitiveness			1
the same goes for empowering the economic potential of those nearing the end of their working lives			2
on paper , preventing people from working later in life looks like a sound way of freeing up jobs for those entering the jobs market			2
but economists call this the " lump of labor " fallacy : in fact , an active , dynamic silver workforce is an excellent way of providing work for the young			1
the future we face may be uncertain but it need not be one of diminished expectations			0
long - term thinking and genuine collaboration between all stakeholders would not only provide quality , sustainable growth and employment , it would once again re-balance national income towards labor , helping addressing the long term trend we are seeing towards income inequality			1
these are the outcomes our future generations deserve and they are outcomes i believe we can deliver			0

*untapped* talent is the key to economic growth , *argues* @entity178
gender equality in the workplace will benefit the economy
despite popular belief , an active silver workforce can provide jobs for the young , she says
