-- take away the 100 - foot screens , the blasting lasers , and the holographic projections , and what do you have left ? tens of thousands of screaming electronic music fans with nothing much to cheer except a solitary figure , twiddling some knobs and occasionally raising his hand			1
for @entity17 fans across the world , the festival and concert visual performances can be almost as crucial as the music -- transforming a @entity20 - set into an unforgettable , transcendent , multi-sensory experience			1

here , we look at six of the names working behind the stage to turn festivals and concerts into unforgettable immersive experiences			1
comix -- @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 @entity50 's 2014 arena tour was a jaw - dropping spectacle -- glittering with laser - fire , pyrotechnics , and epic on - screen visuals -- that promised that the young artist could pack out arenas across the world just as well as more established names			1

the grandson of @entity84 - winning cinematographer @entity83 and the son of @entity84 - nominated production sound mixer @entity86 , the @entity81 - born artist has worked with dubstep star @entity73 ( whose spasmodic performance visuals have also seen him recreated movement - for - movement as a giant robot ) , and " soul goddess " @entity74			1
but it all started with his art school classmate @entity72 -- @entity86 and the experimental music idol have worked together since 2008			2
@entity96 -- @entity97 , @entity98 @entity97 's six - hour long all - night " @entity102 " marathons this year called for a different kind of visual display			2
@entity96 's @entity103 said it took his team a year working with @entity97 to pull together the creative ideas			0

" ( it 's cross between a gig and a film			0

tracks ranging from @entity129 punk to @entity131 pop trio the @entity126 synced to a video performance billed as an immersive revelation of the " illusion of democracy			0
" the performance drew on the expertise of @entity113 , who have been making incredible visual displays for the band for more years			0
the @entity141 -- @entity142 , @entity143 the @entity141 have invented something they 're calling " @entity145			0
" it 's an on - screen viusal performance , improvised live like a jazz band			1
it 's similar to how vjs are working behind the scenes at a festival , anyway -- splicing clips together on - the - fly to match the ebb - and - flow of a dj set			1
here , they 're in control of everything -- creating cinematic narratives ( like this " kaleidoscopic view of the cultural landscape of @entity161 " ) to tell grand stories			0
and they make killer videos for top djs , too			0
