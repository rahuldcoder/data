@entity0 -- when @entity2 launched its @entity3 last summer , few imagined it would reach today 's numbers so quickly , if ever			1
auto - apps could become the next way to customize your ride			1
the store now hosts over 85,000 titles and has passed 2 billion downloads			2
now the concept of the app store has spread like a virus among competitors			0
it 's also reached seemingly unrelated industries , like automobiles and tv set - top boxes			1
the @entity3 taps the creative energy of entrepreneurial developers			0
whether they 're big or small , they can make money through it , even though the challenges for them can be considerable			0
for consumers , the @entity3 offers third - party applications ( free or charged ) that can be downloaded or synched onto an @entity29 or @entity30			1
@entity2 takes 30 percent of a paid app 's revenue and charges developers an annual fee to use the @entity29 software development kit and upload apps to the store			1
but the rest goes to developers , some of whom have profited handsomely from their creations			0
many companies now offer something similar to the @entity3 , if not in whole then in part			0
even if none has yet come close to @entity2 's numbers -- or , arguably , its design achievements -- the spread of the app store idea is undeniable			1
" it seems like every company remotely related to technology is embracing the app store craze , " notes it expert @entity51 in a blog post for @entity53			0
handset makers now offering software stores include @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , and blackberry - maker @entity63			1
on the platform side , @entity68 's @entity65 and @entity67 's @entity66 -- competitors to the @entity69 -- each have an app store now			1
@entity74 and @entity62 , the traditional powers in gaming gadgets , have also launched app stores , for their @entity77 and @entity78 handhelds , respectively			2
@entity2 is now their competitor thanks to all the @entity29 games			1
the chipmaker @entity81 announced last month that it 's setting up multiple app stores through partners like @entity84 and @entity85 to encourage independent developers to create apps for netbooks and handhelds based on its processors			1
for @entity94 , a startup called @entity93 is trying to position itself as the unofficial " app store " for tie - in services			2
cellular operators , wary of becoming " dumb pipes , " are n't sitting idly by			0
@entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , and others getting in on the action with their own app stores			0
not every company is a natural fit for creating app stores , so another market is forming for firms that help set them up			2
a firm called @entity112 has helped @entity62 and the cellular carriers @entity113 ( in @entity115 ) and 3 ( in the @entity116 ) with app stores			0
@entity118 and @entity119 , which already provide various services to carriers , have added " app store provider " to their offerings			0
other firms are helping developers deal with the sudden rash of app stores			0
a @entity129 startup called @entity130 recently launched @entity131 , designed to let developers " design once , deploy in any app store			0
" of course they were n't thinking about app stores outside the mobile space when they wrote that tagline			0
from hand - held to real - world few anticipated the app store meme spreading to cars , for instance , but @entity145 - based @entity144 says it 's helping automakers prepare app stores for drivers			1
for safety , some of these apps would use an audio - only interface for drivers , or be usable only by passengers or when parked , notes @entity160 , a vice president with the company : " automotive applications must consider driver distraction , network security , and reliability within the vehicle			1
" but the possibilities are tantalizing and include taking pictures of a thief in action , playing catch - up audio clips of tv shows , deciphering that obscure @entity169 , and remotely starting the engine or resetting the car alarm			1
such apps could be accessed through home computers or smart phones , as well as from within the vehicle itself			1
@entity144 ca n't reveal too many specifics about upcoming app stores because their rollouts depend on the schedules of the carmakers			0
and many details have yet to be worked out , notes link , such as how revenues will be split with the developers			0
an app store of sorts will also be offered later this year by @entity188 , which sells a tv set - top box that connects to your broadband connection and brings online content to your living room			1
the box already lets customers order @entity196 movies			0
with the upcoming app store , online content normally reserved for computers will be easily accessed over the tv			1
possibilities include video and audio podcasts and photo - sharing destinations			2
as with the @entity3 , the idea is to let any developer ( most likely a content owner in this case ) offer their product through the platform			0
" what an open platform does is create an opportunity for any content owner or content aggregator that has access to content , to make that content available for viewing on the tv , " notes company spokesperson @entity213			2
between six and 12 new apps , or channels , will be offered by the end of this year , he adds , and more will follow			2
of course exactly what will follow is unclear because -- as with the other @entity3 - like offerings -- the only real limit is the imaginations of developers			2

@entity2 's ' @entity233 ' has become *hugely* *successful* and *mimicked* by others
away from hand - held gadgets , apps being developed for cars and tv set - top boxes
such apps could be accessed through home computers or smart phones
