-- in a big swerve in policy , @entity1 has decided to allow people to sign up using nicknames or other pseudonyms on its growing social network , @entity7			1
this summer , @entity1 took some flak for booting users who had used fake names on the 7 - month - old site			1
members of the tech community , who as early adopters had flocked to the search giant 's @entity17 alternative , argued that some people are better known on the internet by their assumed names			2
they also noted that people who used social media as part of social movements , such as those in @entity27 and @entity28 , need to be able to conceal their identity for safety reasons			0
" today we 're pleased to be launching features that will address and remedy the majority of these issues , " @entity31 , a vice president for product development at @entity1 , wrote tuesday on his profile on the site			1
" to be clear -- our work here is n't done , but i 'm really pleased to be shipping a milestone on our journey			0
" starting this week , users will be able to add a nickname alongside their real name , @entity31 said			2
an example ? @entity46 , he wrote			0
they will also be able to change their actual name to an assumed one			0
( one amusing example ? @entity52 )			0
if @entity1 flags a new name as inappropriate , users will be able to appeal and provide documentation , from a driver 's license to appearances in media to " proof of an established identity online with a meaningful following " -- presumably something like a blog or @entity65 account			1
the changes are @entity1 's response to feedback after initial complaints , @entity31 said			2
but not everyone was pleased with the results			0
on the @entity74 web blog , writer @entity72 complained that the new system would , by default , carry a user 's @entity7 name across all of its platforms , such as @entity81			2
so , someone who wanted to use a pseudonym there would , in effect , be announcing that name to anyone they send an e-mail to , whether they want to or not			0
( @entity81 does have a " send mail as " field in its settings that lets users change how their name appears each time they send a message )			2
" we are many things to many people , and that 's what most nicknames are about ; we would n't necessarily want our parents to know how our friends call us , and vice-versa ...			0
" one thing is for sure , this is a huge missed opportunity -- after all , did n't @entity7 acknowledge early on that our social life revolves around different circles ? she clarified , however , that complaints do n't negate high hopes for the site			1
" please wait a second before calling us ' trolls ' or haters ' -- if i and other people are pointing out these flaws , it 's because we sincerely hope @entity7 will become a great @entity17 alternative , " she wrote			1
in his post , @entity31 said that only a tiny percentage of @entity7 users have issues with the names they submit			1
only about 0.1 percent ( one / tenth of one percent ) submit name appeals , he said			0
of those , about 60 percent simply want to add a nickname and 20 percent are businesses who accidentally tried to set up an account as an individual			0
the struggle is n't unique to @entity1 , which last week announced that the site now has more than 90 million users			1
@entity17 policy also requires users to register for the site with their real names			1
that site 's terms and conditions state : " we reserve the right to remove or reclaim [ a user 's name ] if we believe appropriate ( such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user 's actual name )			0
" the sheer size of @entity17 ( the site claims more than 800 million accounts ) means it may take longer for fake accounts to be found , though .			1

@entity7 will now allow pseudonyms , nicknames
*announcement* is a *departure* from previous policy on the site
@entity1 announced its @entity17 rival now has 90 million users
