" 8:48 p.m. the president 's speech is being written right up until the last moments , according to two @entity140 aides , who say they have not seen a new draft since about noon today			2
an embargoed copy of the full speech was supposed to be released at 8:30 p.m. , but there 's no sign of it yet because of last - minute changes			2
8:38 p.m. @entity2 en route to @entity235 8 p.m. @entity1 's @entity237 reports : senior officials said the president 's broad goal was to seize back the mantle of change by talking about the need for a " new beginning " between @entity245 and @entity46 that can restore trust in @entity56			1
along these lines , the president was to make what officials described as a passing reference to the special election in @entity43 but would not have a " chastened " tone like @entity254 after the 1994 election			0
instead , officials said he would use the election defeat as a way to challenge republicans to meet him halfway on the major issues facing the nation			0
officials said he would note that with @entity46 now having 41 votes in the @entity138 , they ca n't just block everything			2
the first test will come next week when the @entity138 is expected to begin debate on a jobs bill			0
the president was to specifically try to sprinkle the jobs bill with small business and corporate tax cuts to win over some @entity46 votes and call their bluff if they do not come on board			2
while jobs and the economy were to make up the bulk of the speech , officials said health care would also figure prominently			2
but they noted the president would not get too specific on the path forward because key lawmakers want to take a deep breath on the volatile issue while ramping up much more time on the jobs legislation			0
beyond jobs and health care , officials said the second tier of the agenda would focus on three primary issues : -- financial regulatory reform , which would give the president another chance to press @entity154 to change the rules of the road to prevent another crisis			0
-- climate change legislation , where the president would specifically cite the work of lawmakers in both parties trying to broker a compromise			0
-- education reform , where the president would push for an increase of up to $ 4 billion despite lean times for other key parts of his budget			0
