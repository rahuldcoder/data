@entity8 ' blog post satirized a fictional letter from what he called " @entity15 " to president @entity14			1

the organization says it plans to spend more to help her get elected			0
the group also targeted incumbent sen. @entity65 in @entity66 for his vote on the @entity68 and helped defeat his bid for a fourth term			0
