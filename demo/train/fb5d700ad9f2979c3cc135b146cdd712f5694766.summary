in the first week of 2014 , i wrote a column suggesting that it was going to be " the year of @entity3			1
" by that , i meant that @entity3 was going to shape the news in powerful ways , economic and political			2
for a start , @entity3 's 30 - year economic superboom ( with growth rates averaging around 10 % ) was going to slow , with global consequences			1
also , @entity3 would begin to face a more complex set of political challenges , with its growing middle class , worsening environment and rising nationalist sentiment			2
i 'd give myself a decent grade for the prediction , but not perfect by any means			0
@entity3 did face political challenges , particularly in @entity20 , and ones that suggest something about the future for all of @entity3			2
( remember , @entity20 is far richer than the rest of @entity3 and so , perhaps , is a window into the country 's future			2
) and @entity3 's economy has slowed			2
even the official numbers put growth around 7 % , and many believe that 's a pumped - up number			0
but the central sense in which the prediction proved true was that as @entity3 's growth slowed , so did its enormous appetite			2
" that giant sucking sound " over the last decade has been the sound of @entity3 importing all kinds of raw materials to fuel its industrialization			2
foremost among those was oil , since @entity3 's energy needs have grown by leaps and bounds			1
@entity49 's @entity48 has pointed out that over the last decade , @entity3 's demand for oil has grown 7 % , year on year			1
in 2014 @entity3 's growth in demand for oil was zero -- nada			1
the great global gas guzzler went quiet			0
that single fact is probably the main explanation for the collapse of oil prices in 2014 ( along with the steady rise of oil and gas production in the @entity60 )			1
this decline in the price of oil is the signature trend coming out of 2014 , and if it persists will shape the economics and politics of the world in 2015 and beyond			2
what i did not predict in any way about the last year was @entity72 's rising belligerence -- most dramatically seen in its determined efforts to keep @entity74 as an " allied " country , using military means , and in the process risking economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation			2
but in a sense , this is also a story with oil as its backdrop			0
over the past decade , as oil prices quadrupled , so did @entity72 's per capita gdp -- and president @entity87 's popularity			1
his rising confidence , and the swelling resources of the @entity72 government , emboldened him to act aggressively in @entity91 in 2008 , and last year in @entity74			0
economic sanctions have hurt @entity72 , but the greatest blow has been the sudden drop in oil prices , which will shape the next chapter of this tale			1
the drop in oil prices has had effects on every continent , in direct and indirect ways			1
@entity105 president @entity104 's decision to try to make amends with the @entity60 is an important example			1
after @entity105 lost its @entity110 patron , the @entity111 , it found a new one in @entity114 's @entity113 , which subsidized the ailing @entity104 regime			0
but @entity113 has been troubled for a while , and @entity114 's successors do not have his political skills , which makes them rely even more on patronage and repression			0
all this has become more difficult as @entity113 's oil revenues dry up			0
the @entity105 regime must have recognized that its sugar daddy was unlikely to keep sending it subsidies , which might explain its efforts to have the @entity60 embargo relaxed			0
the general rule about falling oil prices has been simple : producing countries like @entity72 and @entity113 will suffer , while consuming countries like @entity3 , @entity135 and @entity136 will benefit			1
and that 's a very useful guide with one important exception -- the @entity60 is both the top producer and consumer of oil			1
for most @entity60 , the effect is clearly positive			0
falling gas prices are like a huge tax cut , money that stays with consumers and is likely to be spent on other things			0
for @entity60 oil producers , it 's not such good news , though they will try to lower costs and become more efficient			1
@entity154 aside , the trends look pretty positive for @entity60			0
many of the complications it faces in the world are fueled by high oil prices			1
from @entity72 to @entity161 to @entity113 , lower oil prices could make combative countries more cautious			1
meanwhile , the @entity60 economy continues to grow , with a recovery that appears sustainable and increasingly robust			0
@entity60 technology companies continue to dominate the industries of the future			0
@entity60 society remains vibrant , fueled by immigration			0
even @entity60 government -- certainly compared with its peers in @entity172 and @entity173 -- has performed extremely well			0
it 's quite possible that 2015 will turn out to be the year of @entity60			1

@entity178 : 2014 was year of @entity3 , 2015 might be @entity60 's
