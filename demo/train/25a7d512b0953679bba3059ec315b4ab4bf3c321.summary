@entity0 -- the @entity0 is trying to put sexual violence on the international policy map , telling political and military leaders that wartime mass rape " is no more inevitable than , or acceptable than , mass murder			1
" rape is being used by armed groups to reignite flames of conflict and to terrorize and humiliate communities in @entity12 , according to @entity13 , women 's rights specialist with the @entity0 's @entity14 in conflict initiative			2
the @entity0 is monitoring five countries closely because of sexual violence in conflicts			1
the five are the @entity20 ( formerly @entity20 ) , @entity21 , the @entity23 region in @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 ( formerly @entity26 )			0
but it 's not just @entity12 at which the @entity0 is looking ; it 's cross-regional , @entity27 told @entity1			0
she said armed groups are branding the bodies of women and children with signature patterns , as cattle are branded , in places such as @entity20 , leaving scars so that their families and community members know they are victims of aggravated sexual violence			1
@entity0 officials cite not just the mass scale of such crimes , but the horrific nature of the crimes as well			0
" many are child soldiers , and they maybe have to rape their mother or their siblings and then kill them afterwards , " said @entity47 , the @entity0 secretary - general 's special representative on sexual violence in conflict			1
there have been no reparations for survivors in @entity12 because of the complete collapse of the legal system during conflicts , @entity27 said			0
wartime rape " is one of the great peace and security challenges of our time , " she said , but added it " has been the least condemned and most silenced war crime			1
" @entity47 told reporters recently that in modern war , " rape is not a side effect , but it is actually a new frontline			0
" @entity0 action on that frontline has included a 2008 @entity74 unanimous adoption of a resolution acknowledging rape as a tactic of war and an impediment to peace			2
with the @entity0 's @entity14 in @entity82 initiative , @entity0 representatives have tried to put sexual violence in the spotlight			1
in may , @entity47 took the @entity0 's message to the @entity20 where , she said , more than 200,000 women have been raped in the past 12 years of conflict she visited @entity21 in june and learned rape is still the no. 1 reported crime			1
one government survey in a @entity21 county in 2005 - 2006 found that 92 percent of 1,600 women interviewed reported that they had experienced some form of sexual violence , including rape			2
tackling stereotypes about the crime of rape will help ease the shame many societies attach to rape , and initiating discourse is the first step " to break the silence , " she said , repeating a well - known phrase among anti-rape advocates worldwide			0
her message is motivated by the women and children she 's met , @entity47 said , adding , " survivors are their own best advocates			0
" " the word ' woman ' is not synonymous with ' victim ' or ' vulnerable , ' " @entity47 added			0
" the women that i 've met in the @entity20 , in @entity21 , are agents of recovery and change			2
" as the @entity0 initiative works to fight against wartime rape and to protect victims of that crime , @entity47 sees her own @entity0 role in a highly personal perspective			1
" i 'm responsible not only to the secretary - general and @entity74 , " she said , " but above all , to the survivors of this soul - shattering crime			0
