editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology			1
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- @entity23 is doing extremely well by @entity25 standards			1
of course " by @entity25 standards " means there are dirt roads leading past the brand - new , gold - columned presidential palace , and it seems 1 percent of the country is blowing their country 's gdp at bars with $ 50 cover charges while the other 99 is selling bags of water at stop lights			1
they have huge mineral reserves and lots of foreign money invested in their extraction , all of which ends up concentrated in the hands of the president , his cabinet , and whichever of their cousins they 're getting along with at the time			0
the @entity23 government likes to boast that their unemployment rate is in the single digits and they 're creating millions of new jobs a year specifically targeting the youth bulge , but when you pull up a pile of rubble and sit down with a member of said bulge , the story seems a lot less cheery			1
the actual unemployment rate for 15 - to 24 - year - olds hovers between 25 and 30 percent and unless you 're a relative or close friend of someone in the ruling class , you can look forward to a long and fruitful career in water sales			0
but @entity23 also has a reasonably sophisticated technology infrastructure and has declared itself the " @entity71 of @entity72 , " which is kind of archly tragic because right now the internet is the only thing keeping the kids at bay			1
during @entity78 's oil boom in the 70s , @entity23 flooded into the country to take guest worker jobs			1
within 10 years they 'd worn out their welcome and were deported en mass back to @entity23 , but not before they 'd picked up a popular local pastime : the @entity78 " pen pal scam			2
" the way it works is you become pen pals with some dolt in @entity91 or @entity92 , bitch about how hard your life is in @entity72 , then wait for them to send you money and presents			2
see the rest of @entity99 at @entity9 as computers made their way into the continent , the scam was adapted to e-mail and gradually evolved into the rainbow of weird phishing messages from state treasurers and estate managers and plane - crash lawyers that crowd your inbox every morning			2
and as scammers got hungrier for bigger pickins , they hooked up with hacker - types from the @entity91 and @entity116 who taught them basic credit card fraud , which they combined with the playacting of the e-mail scam to create increasingly elaborate -- and profitable -- superscams			2
then for some reason they combined all of this with black magic , and that 's how @entity130 was born			2
in the same way that hip - hop went from a music style into a descriptor for everything from pants to dancing to potato chips , @entity130 ( which originally referred to a specific credit card scam ) now means pretty much anything involving money -- if you wear a bunch of flashy brand - name clothes you 're dressing " @entity130 , " if you 've got a nice car it 's a " @entity148 " car -- all of which makes sense considering internet scamming is the only way most @entity23 can afford this			1
right now @entity130 is in its salad days			0
the @entity99 movie franchise has made it up to " @entity159 8 , " @entity156 priests are making a killing enchanting e-mails , @entity161 preachers are making a killing complaining about enchanted e-mails , and @entity23 of all ages and interests ( but mostly " young " and " not being poor " ) are packed into internet cafes finding more and more ingenious ways of ripping off @entity169			0
while a lot of @entity130 practitioners have cooked up elaborate post-colonial justifications where they 're just getting the white man back for taking all their gold , a few , like our guide @entity172 , see @entity130 for what it really is : a massive bubble just waiting to burst			0
as @entity23 overtakes freaking @entity78 as the e-fraud capital of the world , the government is scrambling to find a way to keep @entity130 from wrecking the country 's business reputation without cutting off an entire young generation from their sole source of steady revenue			1
and just to make things more interesting , @entity23 just discovered oil .			0

@entity9 goes to @entity23 to learn about @entity130 , a *criminal* world of e-mail scammers
@entity23 has sophisticated tech infrastructure and calls itself the " @entity71 of @entity72 "
government is scrambling to prevent @entity130 from hurting the country 's business reputation
