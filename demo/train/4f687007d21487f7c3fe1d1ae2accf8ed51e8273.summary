-- i have interviewed @entity2 many times over the years , usually after an international summit or @entity6 meeting			1
the agenda at those interviews was the normal stuff of such events ; debt , deficits and dismal economic performance			1
the prospect of sitting down with the former @entity6 chief and asking about personal matters relating to his @entity18 arrest seemed unseemly , and even more odd when it was to be juxtaposed with a discussion on the current economic situation			1
i worried @entity2 would be too timid in giving strong views on the eurozone crisis , its leaders and the problems facing the global economy			1
after all , why should a man now regarded as an outcast of scandal be willing to offend people anymore , especially as he was looking to rehabilitate his image ? read more : two years later , @entity2 still smarting over ' perp walk ' but @entity2 is a man of frank views and , even with the best will in the world , he ca n't help but want to express his opinions			1
he was part of the troika which negotiated the original @entity41 bailout in 2010			0
he says the @entity43 's repeated attempts to buy time has been a " catastrophe , " leading to the @entity47 bailout			1
that , he added , was " another disaster			0
" on the eurozone , he is not afraid to describe the " crises in leadership " facing the union , where he says there are " lions led by sheep			0
" i do n't think he had any particular leader in mind , rather a collective process in @entity61 built in a way that " no hard decision can be made			0
" during the interview , i realize i am speaking with a man who is free of responsibility and not really worried about treading on toes			2
he knows his place in history will be forever defined by seven minutes in a hotel room in @entity18 and his sexual liaison with a maid there			1
charges of rape and sexual misconduct were dismissed after the prosecution admitted the victim involved had a history of lying and was not credible			1
watch : @entity2 : @entity61 's banks are ' sick ' asking @entity2 about this is embarrassing ; our interviews until now have always been about economics and financial markets , not arrests and libertine soirees			1
i try to lighten the moment suggesting there 's no easy way to ask these questions			2
he recognizes my predicament and quips back : " there 's no easy way to answer them			2
" he is ready for what is coming his way			0
his anger at being paraded in handcuffs before the world 's press is still palpable			2
" a most terrible thing ...			0
the perp walk takes place at the moment where you are supposed to be innocent , " he told me			2
he maintains the events in @entity109 are " private			0
" the problem is it 's not only the @entity18 incident			1
since then , a series of incidents have been revealed involving sexual behavior which suggests gross errors of judgment , not expected of people in high office			2
" i agree , i agree , " he tells me			0
he calls it a " mistake " to " believe you could have a public life ...			1
. and that you can have a private life			2
" opinion : @entity2 is back - anyone feel sorry for him ? he added : " i have a problem with understanding what is expected from politicians of highest levels			1
" for someone who has been in the public eye for several decades , this may seem a remarkable statement			2
but perhaps not for someone who has been in the cloistered environment of @entity139 politics , where private and public are clearly defined and mistresses and " libertine soirees " are ignored			1
listening to @entity2 talking about the economic dangers ahead is perhaps the most interesting of our time together			1
after all , he is considered one of the greatest practical economic politicians of our time , bringing together theory and practice			2
he has a prescient warning about the forthcoming @entity152 - @entity43 trade talks			0
the @entity152 wants to " dominate the world " by setting the standards for trade with agreements both across the @entity157 and @entity158 , he says			0
" the @entity61 should not be that naive			0
" i am not confident @entity61 will avoid this fate			0
pulling together the strands of our talk , @entity2 has already said that the @entity43 can not make a decent collective decision			1
he does n't take it this far , but i suspect he believes those sheep leading the union will lead to a trade slaughter			0
our agreed time of half an hour has passed far too quickly			2
i am left with the impression of a man who has discovered who his friends are and is now finding out what he wants to do next			1
he says politics does not feature in that future			0
he is quite clear that he will not run for the @entity139 presidency			0
when asked , he says : " no , no. " it could not be clearer			0
@entity2 is charming , witty , candid and perhaps cunning			1
he carries himself with the air of a man unafraid of his life 's next twist			1
he knows some people will shun him and he says he respects their view			0
but he also believes there are those who will seek his help and advice			0
and for them he is ready to serve , politics be damned .			0

@entity0 's @entity192 has interviewed @entity2 many times , but this time the agenda was different
@entity196 discovered @entity2 was a man who had struggled with aspects of public life
@entity2 knew his place in history would be defined by his sexual liaison with a maid in @entity18
but , after being hit by scandal , @entity2 is unafraid of his life 's next twist
