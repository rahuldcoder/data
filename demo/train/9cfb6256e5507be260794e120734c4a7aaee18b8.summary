@entity0 -- meet the @entity2			0
@entity3 and @entity4 are n't actually related			0
one is a teacher from @entity6 , the other a retired social worker from @entity9			0
but the @entity10 are the faces of a new @entity13 campaign designed to contrast the " shared values " of organized labor against those of the @entity18 brothers , the conservative business titans behind millions of dollars ' worth of secretive campaign spending this election year			1
the " @entity2 " effort is launching thursday with television ads starring the two women airing on national cable television , an official at the labor federation said			2
" we are not related to the @entity18 brothers , those right - wing billionaires , " the two women say in one of the ads set to air			1
" we are just two average women who have raised families and worked hard all our lives			0
" @entity36 boost @entity37 after controversial ad the women do n't make an overt pitch to voters , other than directing viewers to an @entity13 website that accuses the @entity18 brothers of using " their wealth to subvert democracy and enact a self - serving agenda at the expense of working families			1
" the ads also seem designed to put a female - friendly face on organized labor in a year when @entity36 are working feverishly to exploit their advantage over @entity54 among women voters			1
the campaign will include targeted web ads and social media in @entity6 and @entity59 , two states with robust union populations that have competitive @entity63 races this year , as well as future television ad buys			2
@entity1 poll : @entity66 takes slim lead in biggest @entity63 race " the @entity2 is exactly the kind of creative component that taps into modern politics and emblematic of the labor movement 's expansion in progressive politics , " @entity13 spokesman @entity69 said			2
the paid media push is a bit of uncharted territory for organized labor , which pioneered advanced voter targeting and get - out - the - vote techniques that later became essential tools in the modern @entity36 playbook but has largely shied away from campaign messaging			0
@entity84 to raise money at @entity87 's house their political rivals in big business , meanwhile , have long been in the tv ad game but have only recently started investing in field efforts			0
the @entity18 - financed @entity93 has been on the ground doing turnout work in more than two dozen states with competitive @entity63 , @entity97 and governors ' races .			1
