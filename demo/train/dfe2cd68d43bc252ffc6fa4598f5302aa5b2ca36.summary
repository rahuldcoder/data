@entity0 -- @entity3 slugger @entity2 , who received a 162 - game doping suspension , friday withdrew his lawsuits against @entity6 , commissioner @entity7 and the players ' union			1
in the lawsuits , @entity2 had sought to get a @entity12 federal court to throw out the record - setting penalty			1
notices of dismissal in the lawsuits were filed friday in @entity12 , meaning the player will accept the suspension and sit out the 2014 season			1
there was no immediate comment from @entity2 's attorneys or his spokesman , @entity23			2
in a statement , @entity6 said : " we have been informed that @entity2 has reached the prudent decision to end all of the litigation related to the @entity28 matter			0
we believe that mr. @entity2 's actions show his desire to return the focus to the play of our great game on the field and to all of the positive attributes and actions of his fellow @entity37			1
" the @entity40 said in a statement : " @entity2 has done the right thing by withdrawing his lawsuit			0
his decision to move forward is in everyone 's best interest			0
" in one of the lawsuits , filed in october , @entity2 had alleged that @entity6 and @entity7 " engaged in tortious and egregious conduct with one and only one goal ... to destroy the reputation and career of @entity2			1
" the lawsuit had claimed that in its investigation of @entity28 and his @entity28 anti-aging clinic in @entity56 , @entity6 engaged in vigilante justice to prove that @entity2 was using performance enhancing drugs			0
@entity2 has said that the investigation , which was supposed to stay private , has permanently harmed his reputation and ensured that he will never again secure any endorsement contracts			0
did @entity2 expose doping secrets ? the lawsuit included had claimed that @entity6 went around collective bargain agreements to make an example of @entity2 and to " gloss over @entity7 's past inaction and tacit approval of the use of performance enhancing substances in baseball and to secure his legacy as the savior of @entity76 's pastime			1
" @entity6 arbitrator @entity77 last month upheld most of @entity2 's 211 - game doping suspension , keeping him out of the 2014 regular season and the postseason			1
it was the most severe punishment in baseball history for doping and a highlight of baseball commissioner @entity7 's recent high - profile crackdown on performance - enhancing drugs			0
the suspension will not only cost @entity2 $ 25 million in salary , but it also further clouds the groundbreaking career of a player who 'll turn 40 in the 2015 season			2
@entity2 , one of 14 players suspended in the biogenesis scandal , was the only one who appealed his suspension			2
though he was suspended in august , @entity2 played out the 2013 season because of the appeal			0
