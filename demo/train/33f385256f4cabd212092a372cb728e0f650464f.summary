@entity0 , @entity1 -- approval ratings -- and the events that led to the most difficult political year of his presidency -- mean very little to president @entity8 's daughters			1
they are more concerned , he said , with their teenage pursuits			1
" when we sit down at the dinner table , they have some awareness of what 's going on			2
and we have great conversations although mostly it 's about history more than about what 's going on right now , " @entity8 told @entity2 in an exclusive interview airing friday			1
" but it 's true			2
look , they 're teenagers			2
they 're fully absorbed with their lives , what 's going on at school			1
" still , the girls have managed to meet a great number of people who will have a place in history			0
that includes the former @entity35 , pope @entity36			0
it was @entity8 's first year in office , when he took his daughters -- @entity40 and @entity41 -- with him to the @entity42			1
" @entity40 was still pretty young at the time , " @entity8 said			1
" ... they see the @entity44 , and they 're going through the various chambers			2
each time she 'd see somebody dressed up in the cloth , she 'd say ' is that the pope ? is that the pope ? ' how ' bout that guy over there ? ' " his answer : " no , no , you 'll know when it is finally the @entity35			0
" @entity8 does n't know if the girls will be with him when he meets the new leader of the @entity59 , @entity58 , later this year			1
" i have been really impressed so far with the way he has communicated what i think is the essence of the @entity65 faith , and that is a true sense of brotherhood and sisterhood and a true sense of regard for those who are less fortunate , " @entity8 said			2
asked if he might have some advice for the @entity35 on setting expectations a little lower , the president laughed			0
" my suspicion is based on what i 've seen of him so far , he 's a pretty steady guy			1
i do n't think he needs any advice from me on staying humble			0
" pope @entity58 may not need any help with that from the president , but @entity83 cornerback @entity82 might			1
@entity82 's rant following the @entity83 ' win over the @entity86 , a game that earned him a spot in the @entity89 , caused a brouhaha after he declared he was the best			1
he was ultimately fined more than $ 7,800 for unsportsmanlike conduct after he made a choking sign at 49er quarterback @entity93			0
" my sense is he 's taking a page out of @entity98 's playbook , which is , i think he said explicitly , this is a good way to get attention			0
in fact , @entity98 said he got his schtick from wrestlers he used to watch , " @entity8 said			2
" ... so i think it 's part of the tradition ' let me get some attention			0
' obviously , it 's worked			0
i suspect he 's going to have a lot more endorsement contracts and more jersey sales after that			0
" @entity2 gave the president two options of competitions that we wanted him to weigh in on : former secretary of state @entity116 vs. vice president @entity117 for the 2016 @entity119 presidential nomination or the @entity83 vs. the @entity120 in sunday 's @entity89			1
" i think it 's going to be a lot like the @entity83 - 49ers game			0
i think it 's going to come down to the last play , " @entity8 said			1
" ... i 'm not going to pick because i do n't want to offend any of the great cities participating			0
" ok , so if he 's not going to pick in the @entity89 than what about @entity128 versus @entity117 ? " i 'm too smart for that , " the president said			1
