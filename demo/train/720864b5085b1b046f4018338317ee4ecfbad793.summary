but @entity11 's mother , @entity10 , is asking his doctor to recommend her 20 - year - old son be kept at @entity14 for another two weeks , she told @entity1 friday			1
" i do not want him with @entity3 , " @entity15 said			2
" i do not want him in that care			0
that is not the care my son needs			0
" @entity15 is suing @entity3 over unpaid taxes and the @entity8 home where she raised their son , who court documents say suffers from " a number of mental , psychological and physical ailments			1
" @entity11 , in a statement delivered through his father 's lawyer friday afternoon , said that he did not want his mother to be involved in his care			1
" i am an adult , " @entity11 said			2
" i do n't want to have anything to do with my mother			2
any problems that i have ever had is because of the relationship that i had with my mother			0
" when @entity15 heard the quote , she called it " an absolute disgrace " that the lawyer would solicit such a statement from her son while he was under a psychiatric hold , deemed legally incompetent			1
" my son is under a spell , he 's under a trance , " @entity15 said			0
" @entity11 would say whatever his dad wants him to say			1
" @entity15 blames @entity3 for what she said is her son 's downward spiral since he turned 18 and was no longer under her legal guardianship			1

" he had his chance			0
he had his chance to make it right			0

@entity68 is now under investigation for the brutal and public beating of @entity11 on a @entity8 sidewalk tuesday afternoon			1

@entity1 has been unable to contact @entity68 for comment			2
cell phone videos , which have been posted online , indicated that the violence started when @entity11 attempted to kick @entity68 when the trainer objected to the food he wanted to order at a restaurant			2
the video showed @entity11 being repeatedly hit as he was pinned down on the sidewalk			2
@entity3 , in a statement given @entity1 by his spokeswoman friday , called @entity15 's comments blaming him for his son 's psychiatric troubles " unfortunate and inappropriate			1
" " this is a time to focus only on giving love and full support to @entity11 , not an opportunity to lay blame on his father , a man who loves his son very deeply , " @entity11 said			1
@entity15 , who separated from @entity11 after their son was born , said the father was rarely around for her son growing up , while she dealt with his medical and psychological issues			1
" for 18 years , i raised @entity11 so @entity3 could go be @entity3 , and go be a superstar , and he did , " she said			1
" so i raised this boy , 24 - 7 we were glued to the hip			0
" after @entity11 's 18th birthday , his father " orchestrated " his son 's removal from her care by convincing the employees she hired to work for him and giving him his own home and money , @entity15 said			1
" they all go work with @entity3 because he has the money and he has the bank account and he has the fame , and i do n't , " she said			1
@entity11 's special needs were not being met without her , she said			2
" my son right now has been under the care of @entity3 , " she said			1
" that did n't work			0
it 's very obvious it did n't work			0
it failed miserably , failed miserably			0
" @entity11 's lawyer , @entity130 , said @entity15 's lawsuit against @entity11 is her motivation for attacking her son 's father			2
" ms. @entity10 comments about mr. @entity11 are absurd and it 's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her , " @entity130 said			1
" this is clearly all about money for ms. @entity10			2
" @entity15 's lawyer told @entity1 she would file for conservatorship of her son next week so she could ensure he will get the care he needs when he is eventually released from the psychiatric hold			1
" i 'd like my son to be with his mom , where it worked , " @entity15 said			0
" i 'd like my son to be in an environment where it worked			0
you know , 18 years of being successful , 18 years of watching my son respond to all the medical intervention that i have given him and all the support			0
