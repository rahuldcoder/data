-- @entity1 became only the second team to reach three successive major tournament finals after winning a nail - biting penalty shootout against @entity5 following a tense goalless draw in @entity7 on wednesday			1
the 2010 @entity8 and 2008 @entity10 champions followed @entity11 into the history books as @entity13 fired the decisive penalty in off a post after @entity16 had hit the bar for @entity5			1
bizarrely , @entity5 's key man @entity18 never even got to take a spot kick as he was saved for @entity5 's final penalty , a tactic that backfired horribly			1
in a game of few chances , @entity5 worked hard to edge much of it but their pressing tactics started to backfire in extra-time as tiredness increasingly became a factor			0
@entity1 's patience looked to have paid off as they dominated extra-time against an increasingly desperate @entity33 side , but @entity35 's side performed heroics to hold on and force a shootout			2
goalkeeper @entity38 was the central figure , saving spectacularly from @entity40 and @entity41 in extra time , then brilliantly pushing away @entity44 's penalty as the shootout got under way			0
but @entity47 matched that stop by saving @entity50 's spot - kick and @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , with a nerveless chip , all scored in a dramatic shootout			1
there was little sign of the drama to come early on as @entity5 's tactics stifled the champions			0
@entity1 came into this @entity63 clash as warm favorites , but it was @entity5 who looked sharper in the first half			2
@entity35 's side hassled and harried from the start and generally looked the hungrier team but @entity1 , to their credit , remained patient and chances inevitably came their way , fullback @entity74 sidefooting over from the edge of the penalty area			2
with so much creative talent on the pitch it was remarkable that so few chances were created , but perhaps inevitably it was @entity18 who had the bulk of them			0
the @entity86 striker dipped a trademark free - kick narrowly over the bar as @entity5 inched closer and seven minutes from time his effort from similar range was handled in the wall by @entity74 , only for @entity18 to fire over again from 10 yards closer in			1
when @entity1 were given the chance to threaten from a set - piece in injury - time , it looked as though the holders might have the final word			2
instead , it was @entity5 who threatened as @entity44 's free - kick was cleared and played out by @entity100 to give @entity101 the chance to lead a counterattack			1
his final pass to @entity18 was slack , though , and @entity18 's golden chance of sealing a dramatic win instead saw him lash his shot into the stands			0
incredibly , it was @entity18 's 70th shot from outside the penalty area in major tournaments -- and none of them have resulted in a goal			0
it was a chance to kill off the previously lackluster @entity117 and the timing would have been perfect			0
instead , as extra-time progressed , @entity5 's earlier pressing caught up with them as @entity1 's patience started to pay dividends			1
@entity123 pushed further forward and it was his excellent wing play that led to @entity51 being presented with a sidefoot chance from six yards out			0
somehow , though , @entity38 threw out an arm and diverted the goalbound effort around his post			0
it was a heroic piece of goalkeeping and @entity38 also brilliantly kept out @entity131 in extra time , then @entity44 from the spot before @entity5 's resistance finally cracked -- with @entity18 a frustrated spectator .			1

@entity1 become only second team to reach three successive major tournament finals
