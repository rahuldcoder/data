@entity0 -- with a potential diplomatic solution at hand in @entity5 and new signs emerging that @entity7 may be willing to halt its nuclear program , president @entity2 will provide an updated assessment of the @entity11 approach to the @entity12 during the annual @entity13 that begins monday in @entity14			1
@entity2 currently is not slated to meet with @entity7 's new president , @entity15 , though the @entity16 has not ruled out face - to - face diplomacy between the two leaders			1
@entity2 and @entity15 exchanged letters in the months since the @entity7 president was elected in june , and on friday @entity15 wrote in an opinion piece he was open to " a constructive approach " toward areas of contention with the @entity11 , including its nuclear program			1
" the fact of the matter is , we do n't have a meeting scheduled with president @entity15 , but again , we 're always open to diplomacy if we believe it can advance our objectives , " @entity2 's deputy national security adviser , @entity25 , told reporters during a conference call friday , adding that @entity2 has said since 2007 that he 'd be willing to negotiate directly with @entity7 without preconditions			1
in addition to the letters with @entity2 and an op - ed piece in friday 's @entity39 , @entity15 has granted interviews to western news outlets , including one with @entity1 next week			0
" we must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart , " @entity15 wrote in the @entity42			0
publicly , the @entity16 has viewed @entity15 's latest outreach attempts skeptically , saying @entity11 officials will look for actions , not words , on halting nuclear enrichment			2
@entity25 said friday that @entity15 's actions to date were " clearly not sufficient to meet the concerns of the international community with regards to the nuclear program			2
" but the charm offensive , apparently sprung from tough economic sanctions currently in place in @entity7 , prompted speculation that @entity2 and @entity15 would meet at next week 's @entity61 general assembly			1
if they did , it would be the first meeting between an @entity11 president and @entity7 counterpart since @entity7 's @entity67			1
" i ca n't predict every interaction that might take place at different levels at the @entity61 ; it 's possible that there could be some interaction at different levels , but there 's just simply none planned at this moment , " @entity25 said later when asked if there were any scheduled meetings between members of the @entity11 and @entity7 delegations			2
@entity2 will hold bilateral meetings next week with the leaders of @entity82 and @entity83 , as well as with @entity85 president @entity84 -- the first time the two have met since direct @entity12 peace negotiations restarted earlier this year			0
@entity89 prime minister @entity88 is scheduled to visit the @entity16 at the end of september			0
during his address to the @entity61 on tuesday , @entity2 will use events in the @entity12 and @entity93 to explain the evolving role of the @entity11 in that area of the world , @entity25 said friday			0
" given the complexity and breadth of challenge that we face in the region , the president will lay out an update of @entity11 's approach , how we see our interests , how we 're going to be pursuing and prioritizing our policies going forward , " he said			0
that address will include a section on @entity5 , and the use of chemical weapons there			0
the @entity11 and @entity112 recently agreed on a diplomatic plan that would force @entity5 president @entity114 to forfeit his chemical weapons stockpile to international control			0
and @entity2 will reiterate his stance on @entity7 's nuclear program , while conveying his " openness to diplomacy and the prospect for a peaceful resolution of this issue , " @entity25 said .			1
