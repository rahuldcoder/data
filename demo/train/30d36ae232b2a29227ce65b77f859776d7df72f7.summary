@entity0 , @entity1 above @entity5 , the @entity1 and @entity4 space agencies , said thursday			1
debris from the collision poses no threat to the @entity10			1
the collision on tuesday produced two large debris clouds , @entity11 said			1
the satellites collided at 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) per second , producing 500 - 600 new pieces of space debris , the @entity14 said			1
that debris is not believed to pose a threat to the @entity10 as long as the clouds continue moving in a lower orbit , according to @entity11 and the @entity1 federal space agency , @entity23			1
" there is some elevated risk , but it is considered to be very small to the @entity10 and to the other satellites that @entity11 has in orbit , " @entity11 spokeswoman @entity24 told @entity2			1
she said experts were still assessing the effects of the debris			2
@entity33 , from @entity1 mission control center , told @entity35 news agency that the real threat from the debris will become obvious next week , once experts can calculate the trajectory of the fragments ' descent			1
" we have not received a warning of the possible danger to the iss. the fragments may descend to the @entity10 orbit in several years , although i do not rule out that some fragments may go down within several days , " @entity33 said			0
the @entity1 satellite was launched in 1993 and had been out of service at the time of the collision , @entity23 said			1
the @entity4 satellite was part of the @entity56 global mobile communications system and is owned by a consortium headed by @entity58 , the space agency said			1
it was launched in 1997			0
@entity56 said in a statement wednesday it " expects to implement a network solution by friday , " and will " move one of its in - orbit spare satellites into the network constellation to permanently replace the lost satellite " within the next 30 days			0
@entity2 is " one of the larger non-government users " of @entity56 , said @entity70 , operations manager for @entity71			0
" we do rely on it for communication in high - risk areas like @entity76 , @entity77 , and other remote locations , " he said			0
" because of this collision , there may be a slightly longer hole in the coverage from one satellite to the next , but only in a very small area and for a very small amount of time			1
this is a collision , not an internal failure of the satellite or the system			1
" the satellite crash may result in " brief , occasional outages " that may slightly disrupt service , @entity56 said in the statement , adding " this event is not the result of a failure on the part of @entity56 or its technology			2
" @entity70 questioned how @entity4 government , which tracks all space junk larger than a football , did n't see this coming			2
but he said the system will continue to work without any noticeable problems			0
a representative of @entity56 could not immediately be reached for comment			0
@entity11 's @entity109 said a collision like this one is very rare			1
" this is the first impact between two intact satellites traveling at hypervelocity , " she said			0
" there have been some other occasions when things have accidentally collided in space , but they have been parts of rockets or parts of satellites and ( produced ) a very small cloud			2
" @entity125 , of the @entity14 , said : " space is getting pretty crowded			0
the fact that this has n't happened before -- maybe we were getting a little bit lucky			0
" @entity129 said @entity14 tracks more than 18,000 pieces of manmade objects in space every day			0
" any time there 's an event that creates more debris , it 's a concern , " she said			2
" all countries who have assets in space are going to be concerned simply because when there 's more debris , there 's a higher chance it 's going to hit something			2
" @entity2 's @entity147 in @entity0 and @entity148 in @entity149 contributed to this report			0
