-- a federal immigration board rejected an emergency appeal friday for a stay of deportation filed by the lawyer for @entity7 war crimes suspect @entity8			1
@entity8 , shown at his 1993 @entity10 acquittal , is sought by @entity11 for alleged killings at a @entity7 camp			1
the decision by the @entity16 's @entity15 in @entity17 , @entity18 , clears the way for @entity8 's deportation to @entity11 , where he is being sought for his alleged involvement during @entity22 in killings at @entity24 , a @entity7 death camp in @entity25			1
the deportation of @entity8 would close a chapter in one of the longest - running pursuits of an alleged @entity31 perpetrator in history , while also paving the way for an extraordinary @entity11 war crimes trial			1
agents from @entity36 are now free to pick up @entity8 at any point and take him into custody for transport to @entity11 , a board official said			1
the appeals board rejected @entity8 's emergency stay request because it concluded " there is little likelihood of success that his pending motion to re-open the case will be granted , " according to board officials			2
the pending motion argues that a deportation of @entity8 , 89 , to @entity11 would constitute torture			1
" in the four years since his deportation was [ initially ] ordered , his health has seriously deteriorated , " @entity8 's attorney , @entity52 , told @entity0 in a recent telephone interview			1
@entity52 said @entity8 suffers from pre-leukemia , kidney problems , spinal problems and " a couple of types of gout			2
" the board , however , has already signaled that argument will be rejected			0
@entity8 may make an additional expedited appeal for an emergency stay to the @entity67 , though his chances of getting the board 's ruling overturned are believed to be slim , according to @entity16 officials			2
rabbi @entity72 of the @entity73 found irony in @entity52 's argument for his client			0
" he wants to plead the sense of fairness that he regularly denied all of the victims at @entity24 , " @entity72 said			0
@entity72 called @entity8 's comparison of his planned deportation to torture " preposterous coming from a person that served the [ @entity7 organization ] @entity87 in a death camp			1
it is a preposterous argument and insulting to the survivors of the @entity31			0
" @entity72 said that 250,000 @entity91 were killed at the camp , and that none of the guards who worked there was blameless			2
" you were there for one job : kill the @entity91 , " he said			0
" and that 's what they did full - time			0
" he called the evidence against @entity8 " overwhelming			2
" @entity11 authorities issued an arrest warrant for @entity8 on march 10 , accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at the death camp from march to september 1943			1
they studied an identification card provided by the @entity113 @entity112 , and concluded it was genuine , before issuing the warrant			0
@entity8 , a retired autoworker living in @entity116 , @entity117 , has been fighting charges of @entity7 war crimes for more than two decades			1
he was previously extradited from the @entity113 to @entity10 , where he was convicted in 1986 of being " @entity120 , " a guard at the notorious @entity123 extermination camp			0
the conviction was overturned by @entity10 courts on appeal , and he returned to the @entity113			0
the @entity113 filed new charges against him in 1999 , again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard			0
he was stripped of @entity113 citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005 , despite fighting his case all the way to the @entity133			0
@entity8 , a @entity134 , says he fought in the @entity136 army and later was a prisoner of war held by the @entity11			1
@entity0 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0
