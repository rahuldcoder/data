-- do you know who @entity2 was ? or how about @entity4 ? can you tell me what @entity6 did ? @entity8 ? judge @entity9 ? @entity10 ? @entity11 ? i can			2
each of them won the @entity15 horse race			1
( @entity12 of them , by the way , was a horse , not a human being			2
) ok , now can you tell me what each of them did n't do ? i can			2
each of them did not go on to win horse racing 's @entity24			1
i can also tell you why			2
because it is a really hard thing to win , that 's why			1
animal welfare activists : horse racing industry needs reform bet you do n't know @entity33			1
hahaha , he made @entity34 , i beat you to it			2
ok , now i will tell you the sweet and sad tale of @entity33 , and how maybe he could have become one of the most famous racehorses of all time , a @entity41 , a @entity42 , a @entity43			2
in 1932 , when a lot of people were depressed with a capital d , a lot of them were impressed by @entity33 when he won the @entity15 by three lengths and then the @entity50 by a head			1
he and the 19 - year - old boy in his saddle had a nice shot at winning the @entity24 , which only two other horses ( sir @entity56 and @entity57 ) had done			1
how did he do ? well , he did n't			0
@entity33 was a no - go no - show			1
he skipped the @entity59 entirely			1
he was " scratched , " as they say at the track , just as i 'll have another was turned into i 've had enough by his keepers on the eve of today 's scheduled @entity59 race			1
overheard on @entity0 : if wishes were horses , ' another ' secretariat would rise would you like to know why ? i have no idea			1
some horse whisperers spread gossip that @entity33 's paperwork did not get filled out in time			1
others said he must have gotten hurt , but no one confirmed it			0
all anybody knows for sure is , @entity33 sizzled , then fizzled			0
he would not run another race for two full years , and his young jockey was found in @entity81 , drowned			0
bet you do n't know @entity83 , either			0
in 1958 , when folks were giving thought to buying one of @entity88 's really cool new cars , the @entity89 , a lot of them were impressed by @entity83 when he took the @entity15 with a tremendous stretch run , then ran first in the @entity50 , as well			1
a few thousand folks laid bets that @entity83 would do what no horse since the ' 40s had done : wear the @entity24			1
but , alas , a bone that he fractured during the race caused poor @entity83 to hobble home in second place			0
fame , fortune , immortality ... a kingdom for any 3 - year - old horse who could win the big three			1
oh , to become another @entity109 , another @entity110 , another citation			0
bet you do n't know @entity112 he was nothing special , a pretty decent runner in @entity115 , a long shot to say the least when he got into the 1971 @entity15 and sat there in 18th place , going nowhere fast			1
but then , all of a sudden , here came @entity112 , galloping past them all , winning by nearly four lengths			0
and after that , why , there he was again , winning the @entity50 in a record time			0
a horse for the ages			0
all he needed to do was win that darn @entity59 , and maybe he would have , if not for a foot infection that was to blame when he limped home behind @entity133 and two others , out of the money in fourth place , then out of sight , then out of mind			1
@entity41 came along two years later and stole his thunder , not to mention his book and movie deals			0
i went to the @entity59 for the 2004 race			1
so did a throng of 120,139 , the largest crowd in history for a @entity148 sporting event			0
and why were we all there ? to see @entity151			0
he was going to do it			0
the first @entity24 since 1979 and @entity153 was about to be his			1
@entity154 was going to do it in 1997 , but he ran out of steam in the @entity59 at the wire			1
@entity159 was going to do it in 2003 , but he slogged along in the mud and ran a hard - luck third			1
news : no shot at @entity24 as favored colt is scratched from @entity59 ah , but sweet little @entity166 , he could n't miss. he was undefeated			1
he could run in the rain , as he demonstrated at @entity168 while taking the @entity15 by nearly three lengths			1
he could run @entity41 - style and leave everyone else gagging on his dust , as he showed at the @entity50 while winning by more than 11 lengths			1
a lock , that 's what he was			2
" i got the horse right here , " i sang that june 5 , 2004 , day , doing my " @entity178 " bit , slapping a @entity179 against my palm			0
my old crony @entity183 , the great @entity184 sportswriter , was by my side			0
" who else do you like , " he asked			0
" nobody else , " i said			0
" come on , " he cajoled , not liking the favorite 's short odds			2
" who else ? " i sized up the tote board , consulted the handicappers , studied my charts , played my hunch			0
" @entity196 , " i said			0
he was 36 - to - 1			2
my poor pal @entity183 gave me the evil eye			0
he had a $ 20 bill that he did n't want to waste			0
we put down a double sawbuck each			0
we waited for the trumpet to play , 10 minutes to post time			0
we observed a minute of silence for president @entity206 , who passed away that same day			2
i said aloud that @entity196 definitely had a shot			0
i said to myself , " @entity151 could outrun that nag with three legs			0
" @entity151 ran second that day			0
he was caught in the final few strides by some four - legged history - wrecker called @entity196			2
i would see no @entity24 won that day			1
nor would i in 2008 , when the 3 - to - 10 favorite @entity212 was a sure thing , ca n't miss , easy money			2
i have had good days			1
i have had bad days			1
i 'll have another and another			2
i thought saturday would be a great day -- an unforgettable day for an unforgettable horse			0
but you know what ? i 've forgotten him already			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity224 says many horses have won the @entity15 , but not the @entity24
why ? it 's really hard to do . like i 'll have another at @entity59 , they were scratched
many high - hopes horses have met last minute *trouble* , been denied @entity24 , he says
@entity224 : racing has good days and bad ; i 'll have another already forgotten
