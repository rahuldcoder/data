@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 football 's governing body took a tough line against soccer - related disorder wednesday , as it imposed a penalty on @entity10 for " improper conduct " by its fans at the @entity14 tournament			1
the ruling by @entity16 relates to the opening game of the tournament in @entity19 , @entity1 , on friday			1
its officials are still considering what action to take over allegations of racist abuse by @entity10 fans at the same game , and violence before and after a @entity14 game in @entity0 on tuesday			1
police detained 184 people after clashes broke out in the @entity1 capital before and after the @entity1 - @entity10 game , which ended in a 1 - 1 draw			1
interior minister @entity35 told reporters that more arrests could come			0
" police officers continue to watch recordings from @entity40 and police cameras to identify other hooligans who disturbed public order , " he said			0
the suspended six - point deduction imposed on @entity10 by @entity16 will apply to the qualifying campaign for the @entity47 tournament , rather than the current one			1
@entity10 's national football body was also fined 120,000 euros ( $ 150,000 ) , @entity16 said			1
it has three days to appeal the decision			0
the penalty is in response to " crowd disturbances , the setting off and throwing of fireworks and the display of illicit banners , " @entity16 said			2
" the ruling does not take into account the alleged racist abuse of @entity61 defender @entity60 by @entity10 fans during the same game or incidents of crowd violence before the game against @entity1 on monday			1
both incidents are currently being investigated by @entity16 and could result in further penalties being handed out			0
" @entity10 football expert @entity69 told @entity2 the penalty showed @entity16 was taking @entity10 fans ' behavior " very , very seriously			1
" @entity16 earlier condemned what it called " isolated incidents " before and after tuesday 's game in @entity0 " when some groups of known troublemakers pelted the police with missiles and attacked fans irrespective of the team they were supporting			1
" the body said its focus was to ensure that genuine football fans were able to enjoy the games peacefully , while isolating the handful who wanted to cause trouble			0
it is determined that the " overwhelmingly peaceful and festive atmosphere " that has so far prevailed will continue through the final on july 1 , it said wednesday			0
@entity35 said tuesday 's violence had been the biggest public order challenge so far of the tournament -- which @entity1 is co-hosting with @entity96 -- but he praised police efforts			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity98 dismissed those who tried to disrupt the match as " fools , " according to public broadcaster @entity103 's press agency			2
law enforcement officials will be ruthless in suppressing the kind of " limited " trouble seen so far , he is quoted as saying			0
@entity108 , @entity1 's sports minister , told reporters she was appalled by the violence in @entity0			1
" i feel ashamed for those who came not to enjoy sport , but to cause trouble , " she said			0
" they are hooligans , they are n't even fans -- certainly not fans wanting to support @entity1			2
they will face charges and we will not let them ruin this celebration for us			0
" @entity10 supporters had organized a march through @entity0 before the match tuesday evening to mark @entity10 's june 12 national day			2
the disorder broke out as about 5,000 @entity10 fans reached @entity0 's @entity128 , on their way to the @entity130 , the @entity125 said in a statement , with " hooligans " from both sides seeking to start a fight			1
more than 5,600 police officers were on duty in @entity0 , and riot police took " decisive " action to stop the violence from escalating , it said			0
ten police officers were injured in the violence and received medical treatment			0
the 184 suspects detained include more than 150 @entity1 , more than 20 @entity10 , a @entity147 , a @entity148 and a citizen of @entity150 , the statement said			1
some of those arrested had dangerous objects with them , including brass knuckles and clubs , as well as mouth guards			0
those responsible for violence can expect swift justice , the @entity125 statement said			0
" the hooligans will be sentenced by the end of the week			0
in the case of foreigners involved in the incidents , speeded - up penal proceedings will be instituted , " it said			0
those from outside the @entity172 's @entity171 passport - free area will be deported and will receive a ban on entry to the @entity172 , the statement said			0
their visas will also be withdrawn			0
@entity1 journalist @entity177 , who was there when the clashes on the bridge broke out , told @entity2 that the @entity10 supporters had been moving peacefully toward the stadium when " very aggressive @entity1 hooligans " provoked them			2
then , out of the middle of the @entity10 fans , came a number of " hooded and very well trained young guys who knew exactly who they wanted to fight " among the @entity1 , he said			1
@entity10 media focused on the role of @entity1 fans and police in their reports wednesday			1
a headline on state news agency @entity195 reads , " @entity196 hopes @entity1 police will defend guests			2
" the president of the @entity196 , @entity200 , is quoted as saying that " well - trained groups attacked the @entity10 fans , " who he says were behaving perfectly correctly and should have been protected by @entity1 authorities			1
however , @entity69 , the football analyst , said @entity10 has a poor track record when it comes to soccer - related violence			2
questions should be asked about why 5,000 of its fans were allowed to march through @entity0 in what could be considered a provocative act , given the long and troubled history between @entity10 and @entity1 , he said			1
however , when @entity10 hosts the 2018 @entity215 , it is likely to organize it to a " micro level , " he said , in order to avoid similar issues with fan violence			2
@entity10 state - run broadcaster @entity220 reported that @entity1 police fired warning shots and used water cannons and tear gas as they sought to break up the clashes in @entity0			1
@entity227 , director of communications for @entity1 2012 , told @entity2 he felt " anger and shame " that a small group of " hooligans " were trying to spoil the tournament for @entity1 's 37 million citizens and their visitors			1
" i was really , really angry but we must be aware of the scale -- almost 200 persons were taken under custody by @entity1 police and at the same time , almost 200,000 people were having fun here in @entity0 , " he said			2
he defended the policing of the game , saying officers did a good job in closing down the disorder when it kicked off , and said @entity1 would continue its " zero tolerance " policy on fan violence through @entity14 and beyond			1
everyone is determined there will be no repeat of the violence seen tuesday , he said			0
authorities stress that the vast majority of football fans in @entity96 and @entity1 have supported their sides peacefully			1
in the course of tuesday , about 150,000 fans visited the @entity0 " fan zone , " an area away from the stadium where games are shown on big screens for those without tickets , @entity1 's @entity125 said			1
tens of thousands of more fans watched the @entity271 - @entity270 game , played in @entity19 , from that city 's stadium and fan zone , it said			0
altogether , more than a million supporters have flocked to stadiums and fan zones in @entity1 since @entity14 kicked off friday , it said			1
however , @entity10 officials had already called for better behavior from the country 's supporters after the unrest during friday 's opening 4 - 1 win against the @entity270 team			2
" those who choose the sports arena for the declaration of their personal political and other positions have no place in the stands , " read a statement on the @entity196 's website monday			0
" the @entity196 and the national team of @entity10 kindly request all the fans of these provocative actions to confront bullies and to cooperate fully with the organizers of the match in matters of security			2
" we appeal to all fans who are in @entity1			0
remember that you represent your country			0
respect yourself , your home and your team			0
" @entity2 's @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 contributed to this report .			0
