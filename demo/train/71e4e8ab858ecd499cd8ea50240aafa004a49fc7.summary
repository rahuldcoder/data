@entity0 has written a letter apologizing for statements he made in a @entity4 interview that have been slammed by @entity6 groups			1
in a letter to the @entity8 , @entity0 said he was " deeply remorseful " for the comments about @entity10 , which the @entity8 said put forward anti-semitic stereotypes			1
" i am deeply remorseful that comments i recently made in the @entity14 were offensive to many @entity6 people , " @entity0 said			2
" upon reading my comments in print -- i see how insensitive they may be , and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype			0
anything that contributes to this stereotype is unacceptable , including my own words on the matter			0
" @entity0 goes off on hypocrisy , political correctness , @entity10 and @entity27 in the interview , on newstands friday and already published online , @entity0 wades into the controversies involving @entity10 and @entity27 , though to be fair , he does so in the context of ripping hypocrisy and political correctness			1
@entity10 was pilloried for anti-semitic remarks he made in 2006 ; @entity27 was criticized for lashing out at paparazzi with an anti-gay slur last year			2
" @entity10 is in a town that 's run by @entity6 and he said the wrong thing because he 's actually bitten the hand that i guess has fed him -- and does n't need to feed him anymore because he 's got enough dough , " @entity0 said in the interview			1
" but some @entity6 guy in his office somewhere has n't turned and said , ' that f * * * ing kraut ' or ' f * * * those @entity46 , ' whatever it is ? we all hide and try to be so politically correct			2
that 's what gets me			0
it 's just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone			0
" @entity0 's longtime manager , @entity52 , defended @entity0 in a statement to @entity54			0
" i have looked at the @entity4 interview a few times now -- in fact i was in the room during the entire 8 or 9 hours			1
i am unaware -- as i have seen reported -- of @entity0 defending any anti-semitic remarks in the interview , or , for that matter , anyplace ! " said @entity52			1
" he would not do so , and in fact he finds any kind of bigotry , homophobia , anti-semitism , racism or sexism unacceptable and disgraceful			0
if you read the @entity4 piece correctly and entirely , and in context , it is the hypocrisy of political correctness that @entity0 is addressing , nothing else			1
" the @entity8 , however , was not placated by @entity0 's apology			1
" we have just began a conversation with his managing producer			0
at this point , we are not satisfied with what we received			0
his apology is insufficient and not satisfactory , " @entity8 national director @entity79 said			2
the @entity4 interview appears in the magazine 's july / august issue			2
@entity0 stars in the forthcoming film " @entity85			0
