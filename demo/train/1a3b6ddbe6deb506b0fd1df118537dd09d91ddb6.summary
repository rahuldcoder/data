@entity0 -- @entity3 's leaders are battling to keep the eurozone and the wider @entity5 together in the face of a financial crisis that threatens to split partnerships forged over more than half a century			1
so why are they putting so much effort into preserving unity ? and can they prevent today 's debts and differences from dividing the continent for decades to come ? why is unity so important to @entity3 ? the answer lies in @entity3 's history : the continent has historically been split by long - running conflicts that pitted neighboring countries against each other			1
but despite this , the nations of @entity3 also share much in common , as professor @entity24 , of the @entity26 's department of politics and international studies explained			1
" in the 19th century there was an idea that @entity3 had a natural unity , that its constituent parts shared an identity , a culture , a history , " he told @entity1			1
" people were keen to recover this ' lost unity ' which dated back to before the fragmented days of the individual nation states , to previous unions , and even to the @entity40			2
" where did the idea of a @entity5 come from ? the idea of a united @entity3 goes back centuries , and has been proposed by everyone from @entity46 -- the founder of the @entity48 state of @entity49 -- to philosophers @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity54 novelist and activist @entity53 backed the idea of a " @entity57 " in the 19th century , looking forward to the day when the @entity48 of @entity61 and the @entity48 of @entity62 would " stretch out their hands across the sea ... and join together to reap the well - being of all			0
" @entity53 , author of " @entity65 " and the " @entity66 , " predicted that : " a day will come when there will be no battlefields but markets opening to commerce and minds opening to ideas			0
a day will come when the bullets and bombs are replaced by votes			0
" however , it was not until after @entity77 that a @entity5 became a realistic prospect			1
why then ? by 1945 , much of @entity3 had been devastated by two massive wars in quick succession			1
amid the rubble and ruins , politicians and the public -- exhausted by years of violence -- shared the belief that such conflict should never be allowed to happen again			0
rather than focus on trying to find a shared ideology -- the reason behind much of the earlier conflict -- politicians saw economic unity as a way of preventing future clashes			2
@entity54 politician @entity95 , regarded as one of the founding fathers of the @entity5 , came up with the idea of pooling coal and steel production in the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) , so that the " raw ingredients " for war -- munitions -- were placed out of reach			1
he hoped the @entity101 , created in 1951 , would mean that , " any war between @entity54 and @entity107 [ became ] not merely unthinkable , but materially impossible			2
" what is it ? the @entity101 , which was made up of six nations ( @entity54 , @entity107 , @entity111 , @entity112 , the @entity113 and @entity114 ) later evolved into the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) -- under which the member states established a common market , and worked to harmonize their policies on everything from agriculture and fisheries to monetary policy			0
over the following decades , the @entity115 became the @entity5 , and expanded from the original six nations to today 's 27 members , from @entity125 in the north to @entity127 in the south			1
that enlargement has also seen many members of the @entity131 join up -- highlighting another of the @entity5 's key roles			1
" during the @entity133 , @entity3 united to form a bloc against the @entity131 , because there was a genuine fear that the @entity137 would sweep across @entity3 in their tanks , " @entity24 said			1
" @entity141 , that part of the world was extremely unstable			0
it had had a kind of peace , but one built on oppression , and once that collapsed there were real fears of conflict			0
" the @entity5 was very important in ensuring peace and stability in the region -- it helped countries ' transition to democracy , and build economic prosperity			1
" has it worked ? @entity24 says the union has succeeded in its most basic aim			0
" it is still a very important aspect of @entity162 unity that there has been no major war since @entity77 " there have been smaller conflicts , in @entity167 and in the @entity169 country , and of course there was the situation in the @entity173 , but in that case , the prospect of joining the @entity5 has been a very powerful factor in preventing further wars			1
" it has n't all been plain sailing though -- national differences persist , and many issues have caused divisions and debates between the member states , from the introduction of a single currency to the war in @entity188			0
" not all the tensions have gone away , " said @entity24			0
" not all the conflicts have been resolved			0
" the old reflexes , the old fears persist			0
after the fall of the @entity199 , for example , [ president @entity194 ] @entity193 [ of @entity54 ] and [ prime minister @entity195 [ of @entity196 ] were very nervous about the prospect of a united @entity107			0
" however , the euro crisis has provided the union with its biggest challenge yet -- and it is one that is playing on national prejudices and resentments			1
" the @entity208 are very upset that their whole character seems to be being called into question , that they are being portrayed as profligate , irresponsible			2
" the old stereotypes are still there , and they tend to resurface at times of tension			0
the danger is that they can really affect the outcome of these situations , and there is just too much at stake here			0
" how determined are @entity3 's current leaders to support unity at any cost ? in 2011 , @entity54 's president @entity223 insisted that @entity3 would never give up on the euro			1
speaking at the @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity227 , he said : " we will never abandon the euro			2
never ! @entity230 spells @entity3 , the euro is @entity3			1
@entity3 has meant 60 years of peace on our continent			2
we will never abandon that			0
" to imagine that we might pull out of that is to ignore the fact that as people who have been at each others ' throats for centuries , we now have one wish , and that is lasting peace			0
" however , by the end of last year , both @entity54 and @entity107 -- the two driving forces behind the euro -- had admitted that in order to ensure the currency 's survival , @entity208 may have to withdraw			1
can @entity162 unity survive the current crisis ? " the @entity5 was formed for three reasons : to prevent war , to bring political unity , and for economic integration			1
if the euro collapses -- and i suspect it wo n't -- all three of these dimensions would be at risk , " said @entity24			2
" at this stage i think the process is probably irreversible -- there is too much at stake to allow the whole thing to unravel -- if it did it would be worse than the @entity48 subprime crisis			0
so many countries are locked in to the system ; even those who are n't @entity5 members , like @entity269 , have so much bound up in it			2
" i suspect the @entity5 will muddle through in the end -- but then who knows ? there have been so many surprises recently , and you never really know what is around the corner			2

the @entity5 was *designed* to reduce risk of war in @entity3
@entity283 crisis is posing a serious threat to @entity162 unity
there are concerns @entity208 's financial crisis may force it to abandon euro
