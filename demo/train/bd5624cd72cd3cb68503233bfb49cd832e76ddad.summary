-- @entity3 is set to launch an analytics service , it it was reported this week , allowing users to track the popularity of their tweets , their own popularity on the service , and the number of retweets , replies and faves each tweet received			1
in short : @entity3 is launching a powerful tool that will make marketers salivate			1
what 's more , it 's being reported that the product may start at a surprising price : free			0
is @entity3 simply throwing money away ? tracking social media is big business , and the news that @entity3 is set to enter the ring with a free product of its own may strike fear in the hearts of market leaders			1
" social media monitoring " services charge anything from tens of dollars to tens of thousands of dollars per month to provide brands with insights about their social marketing efforts			0
the popular product @entity38 , for instance , has prices starting at $ 600 per month			0
what 's more , brands large and small willingly pay these rates , keen to understand what their customers are saying about them on social media sites -- and perhaps influence those conversations			0
but few businesses are aware such services exist			0
@entity3 would have the advantage of putting its analytics product directly in front of its 175 million users			1
with prices ranging from $ 10 per month for the individual user to thousands of dollars per month for corporate customers , such a service would easily be worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year			0
so why would n't @entity3 jump at this opportunity ? one obvious reason : businesses are more likely to stick with @entity3 if they 're able to measure and improve upon the effectiveness of their marketing efforts			2
to continually update a @entity3 feed requires significant effort , and without any evidence that the activity is improving the bottom line , it 's hard to make the business case for maintaining a @entity3 account			2
with detailed statistics made available to every user , however , the story is very different -- a free analytics product would improve the company 's poor user retention rates			2
there 's another reason to make a social analytics product freely available : @entity80 already does			1
@entity81 , which provides in - depth data to @entity80 page owners , allows news organizations , brands and small businesses to optimize their @entity80 usage to achieve their business goals			1
given the choice between paying for @entity3 stats or using @entity81 for free , perhaps some businesses would choose @entity80 as their social platform of choice			1
customer service concerns may also have swayed @entity3 's thinking			2
when using a free product , customers have low expectations about the level of personal service they expect to receive			0
but once those same customers are paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a product , there 's a need for a much larger customer service team			0
or perhaps @entity3 just wants to get people hooked			0
while the company is rumored to be launching the product as a free service , there 's no reason @entity3 could n't charge for extra features in the future			1
offering a free service to get customers in the door ( the so - called " freemium " model ) could help the company attract more paying customers at a later date			0
so will a free analytics product mean @entity3 is throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars per year ? not necessarily : in the long term , a starting price of free may make better business sense for the social media giant .			1
