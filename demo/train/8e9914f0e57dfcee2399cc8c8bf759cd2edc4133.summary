-- from the " @entity3 " to the " @entity2 , " @entity1 has long been fond of clunky political slogans			1
but the " @entity6 , " widely considered as the governing catchphrase of @entity9 president @entity8 , has a decidedly more captivating ring			1
@entity8 started using the expression even before he took office			2
" the great revival of the @entity9 nation is the greatest @entity6 , " he said in november last year			1
and in march , in his keynote speech to the @entity15 soon after his formal appointment as president , @entity8 said : " we must make persistent efforts , press ahead with indomitable will , continue to push forward the great cause of socialism with @entity9 characteristics , and strive to achieve the @entity9 dream of great rejuvenation of the @entity9 nation			1
" but what does that really mean ? " i think what this means is that @entity9 wants to create a more egalitarian society , " says @entity29 , @entity30 's managing director and chairman of global markets , @entity9			1
" we have a lot of people in the last 20 years who have gotten extraordinarily wealthy			0
but lots of people have been left behind			0
so i think this means that we need to improve the income of the lower segments of society , not just creating an elite			0
" along an old hutong alleyway in @entity1 , we also approached a few @entity9 citizens for their interpretation			1
@entity49 , a 27 - year - old makeup artist says : " for me , the @entity6 is to buy a house in @entity1 and to settle down here			1
" @entity51 , a 25 - year - old hostel receptionist , adds : " my dream is to have enough money to reunite with my family , and not having to travel so far away for jobs			0
" meanwhile , 47 - year - old shopkeeper @entity56 tells us his biggest dream is just having access to medical care			1
ending poverty for @entity8 , the @entity6 is to keep the economy growing			1
in the last three decades , @entity9 has lifted some 600 million people out of poverty			2
to continue to power ahead , @entity9 must reinvent itself from an export machine to a consumer economy			1
that wo n't be easy			0
" we can not rely on investments , building a lot of infrastructure , factories , real estate ... we have to really shift to a service - driven economy , " says @entity29			0
she adds : " aspirational consumers are everywhere in @entity9 , but they need to feel more secure by the future so that they can save less and spend more			2
" corruption challenge apart from building a strong social safety net , there are many more challenges for @entity1 like cleaning up @entity9 's air and combating rampant corruption			1
" people today are looking for things that are more than just about their pocketbook , " says @entity84 , @entity9 correspondent for @entity85			2
" they have a richer conception of what ' the good life ' means			0
they say , for instance , ' i want to live in a city where the air is cleaner			0
' people also say , ' if i go to court , i want to be confident that i can get a reasonable judgment where the judge has n't been bribed or perhaps has n't been politically influenced			0
' " so that 's where it starts to get into a political issue , " says @entity84			0
" in order to satisfy people 's economic demands , there 's going to have to be political reform of some kind			0
and that 's where it gets hard for the party			0
" @entity1 is up against a wall , and has been forced to recognize that its people want more			2
real reform ? senior diplomat @entity118 , who has served as @entity9 's ambassador to the @entity120 among other posts , says : " if you look at president @entity8 's speech , if you look at the @entity123 , you can see they talk loud about political reform			1
" " @entity8 was very clear on that			2
we need rule of law and democracy			0
" but as @entity9 pursues its vision for its place in the world , some worry it is becoming expansionist and aggressive -- especially regarding territorial claims at sea			2
but @entity8 says his government 's intentions are purely peaceful			1
at a recent speech in @entity141 , he said the @entity6 " will not only benefit the @entity9 people but will benefit the people of the whole world			1
" @entity8 has the next decade to show us what his dreams are really made of			0
@entity0 's @entity148 contributed to this report			0

@entity9 president @entity8 says the country must pursue the @entity6
question remains , what is the @entity6 and is it *attainable* ?
@entity1 tell us they dream of buying a house , to work *closer* to home and have medical care
@entity8 's dream is about keeping the economy growing to bring more wealth to citizens
