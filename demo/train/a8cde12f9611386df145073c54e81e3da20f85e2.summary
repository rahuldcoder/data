-- the music of @entity2 was a draw that attracted hundreds of thousands of people to the festival			1
similarly , the name of @entity7 is a draw that attracted a number of actors to his new film , " taking @entity2			1
" from left , " taking @entity2 's " @entity13 , director @entity7 and @entity14 at the movie 's premiere			1
" taking @entity2 , " which is out august 28 , features performers who were either not born or very young when the monumental festival occurred in 1969 , but many were enticed to join the movie because of @entity7 's involvement			1
" i 'd read the sunday paper for @entity7			2
he 's a filmmaker i 've always admired and [ was ] sort of eager to work with , " said @entity25 , who plays a transvestite			1
" so when he approached me , you know : dress , shmess , i 'll do whatever you want			2
" @entity7 's work , which includes the renowned films " @entity36 " and " @entity37 , " has garnered him three @entity35 nominations			2
the lighthearted " @entity42 " is a mild departure for a man whose films tend toward serious drama			2
the film 's plot concerns @entity45 ( @entity14 ) , son of the owners of a fading @entity48 hotel , who helped attract the @entity2 to the area			1
it 's based on @entity45 's memoir			0
the film also stars @entity13 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
the 36 - year - old @entity14 , who is best known for his standup , his contributions to " @entity57 " and hosting " @entity58 , " might have benefited the most from working with @entity7			1
" taking @entity2 " is his first film as star , and he 's made only a handful of others			1
" @entity7 is not really going to hold your hand and reassure you through the whole thing			0
he 's going to be more like a sensei , kind of a tough - love thing , " @entity14 said			1
" he 's like , ' punch this wall , ' and you 'll be like , ' why ? ' and he 's like , ' punch the wall , and do it			0
' " and then it 's like , ' oh , good performance , great			0
i 'm glad i punched the wall , ' and you do n't understand , but it 's really a lesson in trust , " he added			0
@entity54 also came to " taking @entity2 " with limited big - screen experience and was excited to work with @entity7			1
" he 's your fearless leader			0
he 's everything that you want to be when you grow up , " @entity54 said			0
@entity2 may have been 40 years ago , but it 's recent enough that a number of the principals are still alive			1
@entity54 had the opportunity to meet @entity2 co-founder @entity86 , whom he plays in the movie			1
@entity86 opened his memories to @entity54 and also visited the set			0
" he came to the first day on set , and that was a little nerve - wracking , but it then became comforting because as we would be between takes he would , you know , be giving you a little thumbs - up , " @entity54 recalled			0
" i 'm sure it must have been a little out - of - body			0
i mean , i ca n't imagine watching someone playing me in a movie , from 40 years earlier			0
" the 24 - year - old @entity54 thinks @entity2 resonates today			1
" coming from my generation and looking back and seeing such innocence and seeing such passion and seeing such faith in each other , and the ability to come together and actually make something huge happen , is really inspiring , " he said			0
although there have n't been similar watershed events since , @entity25 and @entity54 said that the most similar event could be the 2008 election campaign , during which many young people rallied behind @entity113			1
" well , i got ta say that there is an air of optimism and potential in the election of @entity113 , " @entity25 said			1
" i certainly feel a return to that sense of optimism and patriotism that i think people felt at perhaps the election of @entity125 and the beginning of the civil right 's movement in @entity129 and the sexual revolution			2
... it did feel somewhat timely			0
" the movie also tested @entity13 's and @entity25 personal boundaries : in addition to @entity25 's dress , @entity13 was naked for one scene			1
" it was n't just photographed			0
i was filmed ! " @entity13 said			0
" what was fun about it is it was kind of like this liberating [ situation ] , but that 's what @entity2 was			1
" as for @entity25 , when his children saw him in a dress , they were " terrified , " and his partner , actress @entity147 , was " pretty mortified			2
" " i think that was sort of the point			0
i think the message is one of acceptance , " @entity25 said			2
scaring the kids is one thing , but what about wearing the dress on the set in front of the cast and crew ? " it was exhilaratingly humiliating , " @entity25 said			2
" i think that 's generally how men feel when they put on dresses			0
that 's why they do it so often			0
" @entity0 's @entity169 contributed to this story .			2
