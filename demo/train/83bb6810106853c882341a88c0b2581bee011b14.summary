-- @entity1 is making plans to turn its +1 button into a crowdsourcing tool that helps it re-order search results and fight web spam			1
while not surprising , the move would bring @entity1 's search engine into the social networking era , while simultaneously creating a new avenue for blackhats to manipulate search results and potentially incurring the wrath of trust - busting authorities			1
@entity1 confirmed its plans in an e-mail to @entity17			2
" @entity1 will study the clicks on +1 buttons as a signal that influences the ranking and appearance of websites in search results , " a spokesman wrote			1
" the purpose of any ranking signal is to improve overall search quality			0
for +1 's and other social ranking signals , as with any new ranking signal , we 'll be starting carefully and learning how those signals are related to quality			1
" but these plans are a touchy subject for the search giant , especially given the scrutiny that @entity1 is under from regulators in @entity40 and @entity41 over complaints that the company 's results favor its own products over those of other companies			1
as if to underscore that point , @entity1 prefaced its admission of the +1 search integration project to @entity17 with a statement downplaying its potential significance : " there are more than 200 signals that we use to determine the rank of a website , and last year we made more than 500 improvements to the algorithm			2
" introduced in march , the +1 sharing button debuted with little incentive for web surfers to click on it			0
if you +1 - ed a story on a website that embedded the button , your profile picture would display next to the url when a friend of yours ran a search with results that included that @entity68			0
wired : @entity74 button lets you share , finally but last week , the button entered adolescence , and can now be used to post stories to friends and followers on @entity74 , much as the like button functions for @entity81			0
so the next step of using what people are liking , sharing and buzzing about online to rearrange search results is obvious enough			2
@entity1 dipped its toe into these waters with @entity89 by licensing its stream of @entity91 , but that agreement ended before @entity1 got so far as to figure out how to do more with the fire hose of real - time information than just decorate pre-computed search results with @entity97 ' profile pictures			1
and as for @entity81 ? @entity1 would love to get at its data -- the way that @entity100 is already -- but the two companies go together like toothpaste and orange juice			0
@entity81 will likely never let @entity1 anywhere near its data stream , which meant that @entity1 had to build in its own social network			2
but therein lies the rub			0
if @entity1 's search results become heavily dependent on social signals from @entity74 , then there 's going to be heavy pressure on the net 's websites to embed the @entity74 button			1
and depending on where you work -- say , @entity81 or the @entity118 -- that could look like @entity1 is unfairly using its search engine might to boost its @entity81 alternative			1
that might explain why @entity122 killed a story by @entity124 entitled " @entity125 " which was seemingly based on information from a meeting with @entity1 ad representatives			0
on august 18 , @entity129 wrote , " the message in this meeting was clear : " put a @entity132 button on your pages or your search traffic will suffer			0
" @entity129 followed up with @entity1 's press team			2
which gave @entity129 the same carefully couched answer it gave @entity0			0
but the story quickly disappeared from @entity122 ' website and from the @entity1 cache , though it was noticed and saved by the @entity143 blog			0
one guesses the tone of the post -- and its headline -- rankled someone somewhere			0
@entity122 , @entity129 and @entity1 all declined to talk on the record about the post that disappeared into the memory hole			0
wired : how @entity81 could beat @entity1 and win the net that silence says as much as you need to know about the touchiness involved in integrating a @entity1 +1 button with @entity1 's search box			1
but @entity1 's biggest weakness is the possibility that someone will figure out how to build a better search engine -- and there 's many who bet the way to do that is to make search involve more of a human touch and less of a machine 's			1
indeed , @entity1 's interest in incorporating +1s into its search ranking algorithm might also explain @entity1 's hard line position in the so - called @entity172 wars			1
@entity1 is being adamant that users of its new social networking tool use their real names			2
in its zeal to root out fakers and people using pseudonyms , @entity1 has deleted legitimate profiles and raised the ire of those who defend the need for pseudonyms on the internet 's identity platforms			2
but if @entity1 's going to start using those +1 votes , the company is virtually inviting the world 's spammers and blackhat @entity143 magicians to flood its social networking system with fake profiles and fake votes -- potentially ruining it and possibly making the problem of search spam even worse			1
