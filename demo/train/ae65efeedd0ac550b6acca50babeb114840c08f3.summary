@entity0 -- @entity3 's perennial armchair - quarterback argument over the need for a clear - cut national champion came to @entity6 friday			1
college football teams play in the @entity8 for the national championship trophy			1
the @entity10 held a hearing to dissect the @entity8 , asking whether the model needs to be tweaked , overhauled or done away with altogether			2
four witnesses testified at the morning hearing , including championship series coordinator @entity15 and @entity18 president @entity17 ; both of whom defended the current system , though @entity17 conceded that " no system is perfect and the @entity8 is not perfect			1
" @entity23 commissioner @entity22 and @entity25 athletic director @entity24 testified that they would like to see the system revamped			0
many critics say they want college football to have a playoff system to ensure that a champion is clearly defined			1
rep. @entity30 , @entity31 , called the @entity8 format unfair and perhaps took it one step further			2
" you should either change your name to @entity36 for @entity37 or just drop the @entity38 and call it the bs system , because it is not about determining the championship on the field			0
" both sides were cordial but opinionated			0
@entity17 said he would prefer @entity0 not get involved			0
" those who do n't like the current system will say that 's the way of the world , but we do n't believe that government should have any role in promoting a demise of the bowl games			2
" currently , 11 college conferences and three independents compete in the @entity55 -- formerly @entity56 of those 11 conferences are guaranteed spots in the four @entity8 games			1
schools from conferences that critics say are unfairly deemed as low profile are then left to fight their way into those prestige games			0
they share in significantly less of the series money and have less of an opportunity to challenge for the national title			0
president @entity70 is one of the proponents of a college football playoff			1
in an interview with @entity74 in november , @entity70 said he 's had just about enough of the @entity8			2
" i 'm fed up with these computer rankings and this , that and the other			0
get eight teams -- the top eight teams right at the end			0
decide on a national champion , " @entity70 said			0
before heading out early to catch a flight , @entity30 made it clear that he expects to see college football change its ways or risk having lawmakers introduce legislation to impose change for them			1
" i think there is better than a 50 percent chance that if we do n't see some action in the next two months on a voluntary switch to a playoff system that you will see this bill move , " he said .			1

@entity8 decides college football 's national champ
perennial argument is that a playoff system would be a better way to decide
house committee hears *testimony* from officials , *coaches* on both sides
