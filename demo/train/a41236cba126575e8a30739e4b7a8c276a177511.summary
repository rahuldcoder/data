@entity0 , my sister 's miniature schnauzer , made quite an impression on me during an extended visit			2
i even found a schnauzer rescue group and submitted an online application , hoping for a feisty fur kid of my own			1
i remember being disappointed at the time , but regular outings with @entity0 helped ease my bruised ego			2
eventually , i crossed paths with a precocious pooch named @entity15 who changed everything			2
our escapades inspired my quest to help other frazzled , first - time pet owners			1
i also took solace in a hilarious book called " what the dog did : tales from a @entity27 , " by @entity28			1
stories about @entity31 the beagle helped me realize that i was n't alone in lamenting my @entity15 's penchant for chewing shoes , rolls of toilet paper or brand - new dog beds			1
in @entity28 's recent @entity39 article , she writes about being rebuffed by a rescue organization , after suffering through a litany of probing questions			1
eventually , her family gave up and purchased their next pet from a breeder			2
@entity28 's column reminded me of that fruitless schnauzer application all those years ago			2
perhaps my own answers took me out of the running			0
" people who rescue animals can be reluctant to believe anyone deserves the furry creatures , " @entity28 says in the article			1
" applicants are sometimes subjected to an interrogation that would befit @entity58			1
" @entity59 : cuddling dying pets can expose owners to infections why all the drama ? rescue organizations relieve overcrowded animal shelters by placing animals in foster homes and actively promoting them on sites like @entity69			1
as rescued pets adjust to family life , volunteers gather information that will help them find a love match			0
if things do n't work out , most rescue groups allow you to return the pet -- no questions asked -- which makes the vetting process even more important on the front end			1
but questions such as " do you plan to have children ? " or " how much would you spend on a sick animal ? " can rub some well - intentioned pet lovers the wrong way			0
representatives from three rescue groups offer a little insight on some of those probing pet questions			1
how much are you willing you spend on a pet ? " that 's just our way of making sure they have no problem taking the dog to the vet if it 's hurt or sick , " says @entity92 , director of @entity93 ( 911ruff.org )			1
based in @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity102 ' nonprofit organization has struggled to place dogs after the @entity107 oil spill			0
rather than take in more pets from animal shelters , @entity102 and her team have focused on finding homes for the remaining 34 pets in her care			1
recent owner surrenders , due to military deployment or a battered @entity119 economy , make the adoption process even tougher			1
but her goal is to avoid making a bad match			0
" they 've been through enough already			0
" the issue of pet expenses also becomes a factor when people select high - maintenance breeds			0
bulldogs are notoriously allergic to grains			0
these short - snouted dogs also tend to have breathing issues , placing them at the top of the " do not fly " list for most airlines			0
but the popular breed generates plenty of adoption applications for @entity141 or @entity142			1
" i turn away a lot of people who have unrealistic expectations , " says @entity143 , director of @entity142			0
she notes that a typical vet visit for one of her bulldogs can top $ 200			1
annual veterinary bills for poorly bred @entity153 bulldogs can easily cost 10 times that amount			0
@entity59 : pet resources for a tough economy in 2011 , dog owners spent $ 248 on routine vet care and cat owners spent $ 219 , according to a survey by the @entity161			1
like people , pets also get sick from time to time , adding to that bill			0
rescue groups look for applicants who will commit to routine vaccinations , along with preventatives to fight fleas and the threat of heartworm , a life - threatening illness transmitted by infected mosquitoes			1
do you have a veterinarian ? " we contact [ the vet ] to make sure they bought heartworm preventatives , flea preventatives , that they kept the pet up to date on shots , " @entity102 says , noting that vets provide clues to a pet 's care			1
" when i called , [ one applicant ] had n't taken dogs to the vet in years			2
i would hate to know [ a dog ] was hurt and they did not take them to the vet			1
" her rescue will accept first - time pet owners , even without a veterinary referral			1
in those cases , @entity102 provides a pet primer , filled with information about flea and heartworm preventatives , foods to avoid such as chocolate , and other key information			0
do you plan on having children ? kids and pets can peacefully coexist , but some little ones have trouble resisting the temptation to pull ears or tails			0
my nephew 's first steps were quickly followed by mad dashes around the house in hot pursuit of @entity0			0
my sister quickly had to introduce the word , " gentle , " during playtime when he tried to tap rather than pet the poor pooch			0
most rescue groups also have stories of owners who surrendered pets because they could n't handle the work involved with raising kids and pets			1
" we would get owner surrenders from young people who got bulldogs as their first child -- then they had children -- and were unable to afford both , " @entity230 says			0
@entity102 adds that the question helps them determine a good fit for the pet			0
" we know which dogs do and do not like children , " she says			0
" i do n't want a child to get hurt			0
" do you own a home or rent ? " we received a form last week , an owner surrender , because the person did n't check with their landlord first , " says @entity250 , vice president of @entity251 ( @entity251 )			1
" the landlord said you are not allowed to have dogs over 45 pounds , and the dog had to go			1
" @entity251 requires prospective clients to secure a letter from their landlord as part of the adoption process			1
@entity102 also recommends that all family members visit prospective pets , and agree to the adoption			2
if living conditions change , it helps to have other members of the household who will take responsibility for the pet			0
@entity59 : 10 things you might not know about cats do you have a fenced backyard ? " when people go to work , let 's say they have an 8 to 5 job , they have to leave early to get to the job , then they are late coming home			0
that 's nine to 10 hours before the dog can go out , " @entity102 says			2
" if you have a way for dog to go out , potty and come back in , there 's generally no problem with the new home			2
the people are happy ; the dogs are happy			0
" while @entity250 admits that questions on adoption applications can resemble the @entity296 , honest answers help volunteers find the best fit			2
some rescued dogs have never seen the inside of a house			0
others require extensive training or veterinary care before they are ready to be adopted			2
@entity305 , a 7 - month - old new addition to @entity251 , arrived with such severe mange that it had caused secondary skin infections on about 40 % of his body			1
after receiving medical attention and a little love from his foster family , he is slowly beginning to heal and even play			0
" these dogs come from rough backgrounds , " @entity250 says			0
" we want them to have a permanent home , and not be turned back in to a rescue or hop from home to home			2

in 2011 , dog owners spent $ 248 on routine vet care and cat owners spent $ 219
