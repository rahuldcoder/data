-- @entity1 lived the @entity3 dream			1
she had a six - figure salary as an executive with @entity6 , a @entity7 and a three - bedroom house in sunny @entity9			2
but then , she fell in love			0
she met someone from @entity12 on an online dating service			0
they chatted over the @entity15 and by phone for five months and decided they wanted to be together			0
that 's where this simple love story gets very complicated			0
@entity22 ' partner is a woman , @entity21			0
if she were a man , the two could get married and @entity22 could apply for her spouse to be admitted to the @entity3 and eventually gain permanent residency			1
but current immigration law does not allow a @entity3 citizen in a same - sex relationship to sponsor his or her spouse or partner			1
there are nearly 30,000 such couples in @entity3 who now find themselves in the crosshairs of two critical national debates : the 1996 @entity37 , or @entity37 , and immigration reform			1
one of those debates could be settled wednesday			2
the @entity40 is poised to hand down decisions on two gay marriage cases wednesday , the last day of the court 's term			1
one involves the constitutionality of @entity46 , a @entity9 referendum that banned same - sex marriage			1
if prop 8 is struck down , @entity22 could marry @entity21 in her home state just like she could in the @entity51 or one of the 12 other states that allow gay marriage			2
but that marriage would be invisible as far as immigration law is concerned			1
@entity22 could not sponsor her wife because of @entity37 , which prohibits the federal government from recognizing same - sex marriages			1
so @entity22 , 48 , gave up her life in the @entity3 and moved to @entity12 , where she launched an information technology company			1
the company is struggling and @entity22 misses everything about @entity3			1
but she can not imagine a life without @entity64			0
" our life is surrounded by uncertainty			0
we live in limbo all the time , " she said , not knowing if one day her work visa in @entity12 might not be extended			0
she goes to sleep every night worrying that tomorrow , she may be separated from the woman she loves			0
if the justices strike down @entity37 , bi-national gay couples will gain the same immigration rights as heterosexual married couples			1
at the same time , @entity76 , a @entity77 senator from @entity78 , has filed an amendment to an immigration reform bill in the @entity81 that would afford gay couples equality in immigration sponsorship			1
@entity84 , spokesman for @entity85 , an organization that has been working on this issue for two decades , said for the first time , the @entity88 community is optimistic that immigration policy will become less discriminatory			2
" as of today , we are stuck in a race to see who 's going to solve the problem first , " @entity84 said			0
" if the @entity81 bill is about to receive its final vote and either we do not have a court ruling or we have a bad court ruling , then ( @entity76 's ) amendment becomes absolutely critical for binational couples			1
" gay rights plan clouds immigration reform prospects the amendment , however , does n't sit well with conservatives and even with more liberal lawmakers who believe it could potentially derail the entire immigration reform bill			1
the chances of @entity76 's amendment passing , say immigration activists , are slim to none			1
in any case , if the @entity40 strikes down @entity37 , the immigration amendment would be moot			1
" i ca n't sleep thinking about all this , " @entity1 said from her residence in @entity115			0
a bill to recognize same - sex partners for immigration purposes was first introduced in @entity120 in 2000			1
since then countless couples have been separated or have had to make the same difficult decision as @entity22 and leave home			2
in @entity126 , @entity125 native @entity124 , 36 , has grown resolute in her efforts to establish a normal life , despite the dark immigration cloud that hangs over her			2
she and her partner , @entity133 , have been together five years and run a nonprofit consulting agency			0
they bought a house , and @entity124 is halfway through her first pregnancy			0
( more than 17,000 children in this country are being raised by binational couples			2
) @entity141 and @entity124 have picked out names : @entity143 if it 's a boy and @entity146 for a girl			0
but come february , @entity124 's temporary work visa , known as an @entity149 , will expire , and she could very likely have to leave @entity3			1
@entity141 can not sponsor her for permanent residency or what 's more commonly called a green card			2
@entity124 's child will be born a @entity3 citizen , but under current law , children can not sponsor parents until they are 21			1
" we 're kind of waiting to see what happens in the @entity40			1
our options are very murky , " @entity124 said			0
they could move to @entity125 , but it will be difficult there for @entity141			0
she 's 47 , settled in @entity126 and does n't speak @entity165			0
the two have discussed moving elsewhere , maybe to immigration - friendly @entity167			1
@entity169 law professor @entity168 , who practiced immigration law for 12 years , described " love - exiled " cases as one of the few instances in which he has given this advice : go north			2
" marriage is just so important to @entity3 immigration law , " @entity168 said			1
opinion : gay rights , immigration reform on collision course @entity167 is the top destination for same - sex binational couples in the @entity3 because of proximity and its immigration system			1
@entity167 uses a point system to determine who will be allowed in to live and work			0
applicants are awarded points for proficiency in education , job experience and language skills			0
if one partner qualifies for immigration status in @entity167 , he or she can sponsor the other			2
@entity199 , 31 , of @entity200 and his spouse , @entity201 , 29 , live in @entity202 , a state that bans same - sex marriage			1
they were among the first seven couples to get married in @entity206 -- @entity201 grew up in @entity207 -- on @entity208 after that state approved same - sex marriage last fall			1
but now , with an expiration date on @entity199 's student visa , they 're considering @entity167			0
@entity199 watched his brother marry an @entity3 woman and become a citizen			2
his younger sister married an @entity3 man and within a very short time , she received her green card			2
but when @entity199 's visa expires , he will either have to find a job with a company that might sponsor him or leave			2
" when we think about graduation or starting a family , it takes us back to that root conversation about immigration , " said @entity199 from his home in @entity225 , @entity202			0
in all , 31 countries recognize same - sex relationships for immigration purposes			1
some , like @entity235 , do n't have legalized same - sex marriage but still recognize same - sex couples			1
that 's why @entity239 , 35 , abandoned his law career in @entity241 and moved to @entity242 to be with his partner , @entity243			0
even though the state of @entity241 approved same - sex marriage in 2011 , a wedding was not going to help when @entity243 's temporary work visa ran out			1
" you do n't get more committed than giving up your country , " @entity239 said			0
" that 's the value @entity37 was supposed to be protecting			2
is n't marriage all about the sanctity of commitment ? " @entity239 is angry -- not at his partner but at his country -- for having to give up everything he cherished and begin again in a foreign land			0
psychology professor @entity259 is researching people like @entity239 and the emotional toll of having to live in exile for the sake of preserving a relationship			0
" the whole situation of not knowing what the future holds and kind of having to wait with bated breath to see what politicians or the @entity40 decides creates a great deal of anxiety , " said @entity259 , who teaches at the @entity265 in southern @entity9			2
" a lot of same - sex binational couples have a hard time trying to figure out what their future looks like			1
" @entity124 said she has lived with that anxiety since she arrived in the @entity3 in 2001 , constantly filing paperwork for visa applications including an employer - based green card sponsorship that was rejected			1
it became so all - consuming that she decided not to fret about it anymore			0
she and @entity141 are bracing for a high court decision that will not be in their favor			0
" whatever they throw at us , we 'll manage , " @entity141 said			0
they know one thing : no matter what , they will find a way to be together			0
but no one , they said , should have to choose between love and country			0

the @entity40 is poised to hand down a ruling on same - sex marriage
because of @entity37 , @entity3 citizens can not sponsor same - sex partners for immigration
30,000 same - sex couples are in the crosshairs of two national debates
amendment to immigration reform bill would also bring relief
