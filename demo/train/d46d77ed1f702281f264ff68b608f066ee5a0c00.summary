-- if i had to sum up our week in @entity4 with one thought , it would be " boiler suit "			1
we were there to film our segment for @entity10 's frontiers on oil and we quickly realized that there 's not much to see in the oil and gas industry that does n't require some hard - core protective clothing			1
we went offshore to an oil rig in the @entity16 to see how in @entity4 they manage to produce the greenest barrel of oil in the world			1
for every barrel of oil produced , 8kg of carbon dioxide is emitted			1
that 's sixty percent less than the global average			1
when you visit an oil rig you see that it is an entire world in itself			1
at @entity31 's @entity30 platform , 90 miles west of @entity32 , they have three course meals , a cinema , and even a weekly body pump aerobics class			0
it 's definitely a perk of the job when you find yourself transported to another world , learning about things you left behind at school			2
i remember studying the oil cycle in chemistry , and learning about it from my father , who used to work in the industry			1
but back to the boiler suits ... there 's one suit to travel to the platform , there 's another layer of safety gear to add when you take the smaller helicopter , and there 's an entirely different outfit to walk around the platform in general			0
accessories come in a range of fluorescent pinks , oranges and yellows			0
( think headphones , ear plugs , walkie - talkies , belts , glasses , rubber hoods , shoes )			0
@entity73 in bright orange , the @entity0 crew flew around the rig to get some aerial shots of the platform			1
if you 've never been in a helicopter before , it 's quite a peculiar feeling when you lift off the helipad vertically			0
@entity81 , the cameraman , was actually harnessed to the roof of the helicopter because he was hanging out of the open door with a very heavy camera , trying to film the rig below for our opening sequence			0
as far as the eye could see there were oil and gas platforms , stretching out across the horizon			2
some were in @entity4 waters , some in @entity96 waters			1
it really gave me a sense of the size and power of the petroleum industry			2
after we 'd landed , the platform manager took a sample of the oil which was being processed at the rig and showed it to us			2
i realized it was the first time i 'd ever seen oil in its true form			2
so many things we are surrounded by each day are made from oil , but most of us never get close to the stuff			2
oil is a commodity that really influences world markets and geopolitics			0
it was funny to see it in a little plastic container			0
we get a third of the world 's energy from oil , and even optimistic forecasts say it will play a significant part in meeting future energy demands			0
but the environmentalists we spoke to were all united in calling for an end to the world 's , and @entity4 's , addiction to oil			1
in @entity4 they have a great attitude towards the environment			1
there were little notes on our beds in fifth - floor hotel rooms with encouragements to use the stairs ; the napkin dispensers in restaurants are emblazoned with " just take one " ; and there were recycling bins on every street corner			0
i was left wondering how this environmental awareness translates into the big business of oil and gas exports			0
and also whether i 'd be able to sneak at least one of the boiler suits home as a colorful memento of our trip			0
what part do you think oil has in our future energy mix ? will it be big business as usual or can the industry do more to clean itself up ? share your thoughts in the @entity165 off box below			1

@entity0 traveled to @entity4 to report on the oil industry
visited oil rigs and *refineries* to find out how " green " each barrel of oil could be
for each barrel of oil produced , 8kg of carbon dioxide is emitted ; 60 percent less than the global average .
