the @entity1 - @entity0 of a good spelling bee may have forever changed in @entity3			1
it took seventh grader @entity5 more than 90 rounds and two days -- separated by about two weeks -- to finally get the winning word			1
he beat fifth grader @entity9 , who went out on the word " stifling , " earning a spot in the @entity12			1
the two met february 22 at the @entity14 for the regularly scheduled competition , where they exhausted all the words on a list provided to the judges			1
after more than 60 rounds , the match was halted without a winner			0
" we did n't want to just go through the dictionary and give them more words , " @entity22 , outreach coordinator for @entity14 , said at the time			2
" we feared that someone would get a word that was too easy while the other would get an extremely difficult word			2
we wanted to be a bit more calculated and neutral , and we wanted to give each an equal opportunity			0
" but soon , @entity5 and @entity9 were more than two young , ace spellers from @entity34			1
they were national celebrities , appearing on @entity35 and @entity37 's " @entity36			0
" that made saturday 's rematch all that much bigger			0
the library could n't contain those who came to watch and ended up setting up a live video stream so that about 100 spectators could watch from the lobby , @entity22 said			0
and this might not be the last time @entity5 and @entity46 in the spelling arena			1
as @entity22 noted , " both students are young enough -- they could face each other again " next year			0
