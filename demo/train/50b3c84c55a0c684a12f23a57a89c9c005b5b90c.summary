-- why waste your time futilely shaking your fist at the driver who cut you off on the country road when you can take him to task on the information superhighway ? @entity7 says the @entity9 feed gives people an " outlet to vent your frustration " over bad drivers			1
@entity14 is a month - old @entity9 feed that takes road rage into the information age			1
it lets aggrieved motorists in @entity21 fire off 140 - character vents about drivers who follow too closely , park too tightly , drive too fast or flout other vehicular etiquette			1
when " you yell out the window or give them the finger , you really do n't get any vindication , " said the @entity9 feed 's co-creator , @entity7			1
" this gives you an outlet to vent your frustration to others and feel like you 've gotten a little justice			2
" @entity7 hatched the idea after she found her mother 's instant messages , or tweets , were increasingly becoming rants on bad driving			1
her parents commute 50 miles each way from their home in @entity46 to anchorage every day			2
her mother , @entity47 , would unleash her fury over aggressive or annoying driving antics from the passenger seat , via the micro-blogging site @entity9			1
" i kept seeing more and more angry ones , and i said , ' why do n't i set one up just for that ? ' " @entity7 said			2
" then we said , ' why ca n't we let other people post to it , too ? ' " that was three weeks ago			2
thanks to an appearance on a morning radio show and a feature in the @entity63 , the feed now has 648 followers -- and climbing			1
they send their rants privately , and the mother - daughter duo posts them anonymously			1
" @entity69 bug on @entity70 -- does your car come with turn signals ? let 's use ' em , " said one post			0
another urged the use of mud flaps : " get some you 're killing the rest of us with cracks and chips in our windshields ! " some post pictures of offending vehicles : " really , @entity88 ? no one is this skinny			0
i so do not love climbing in my passenger door			0
" and some include license plate numbers , which @entity7 sees nothing wrong with			1
" we 're not trying to be hurtful			0
the license plate is stuck on the front of your car , " she said			1
" anybody can do anything with it			0
we 're not posting names or anything			0
" @entity7 and her mother edit the rants , but do not post any of their own			0
nor do they text and drive , she stressed			0
" why would i be part of the problem ? that seems silly to me , " she said			0
" i find myself driving more carefully because i 'm scared -- ' oh @entity113 , what if someone catches me ? ' " they 're not out to change the world , @entity7 said			0
they just hope that the next time you 're on the receiving end of an errant honker , you can resist the urge to tap into your inner beast -- and use your fingers to tap out a tweet instead			2
after you pull over , of course .			0
