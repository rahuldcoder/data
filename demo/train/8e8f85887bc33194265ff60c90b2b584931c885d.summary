-- with so many talk show hosts elbowing for our late night tv viewing attention — @entity5 and @entity6 and @entity7 and @entity7 and @entity8 and @entity9 and @entity10 and @entity11 and @entity12 and @entity13 — it 's hard to remember that there was a time when there was just @entity17			1
for 30 years on @entity18 , @entity13 dominated the late night landscape along with his stalwart sidekick @entity20 , putting the nation to bed with a formula of monologue , celebrity interview , occasional skit , and musical guest that remains more - or-less intact to this day			1
but while @entity17 was a fixture of @entity30 culture , part of his legend is that he remained essentially a mystery — an intensely private man who granted few interviews and all but disappeared from public view from when he retired in 1992 to when he died in 2005			2
deadline is reporting that a biopic about @entity13 is currently in the works , with screenwriter @entity42 ( " @entity43 , " this month 's " @entity44 " ) adapting journalist @entity46 's forthcoming biography " @entity13 the magnificent : an @entity48			1
" there is no studio or director yet attached to the project — and since the book has yet to be released , everything remains in the embryonic stages			1
but with a subject who looms so large in @entity30 pop culture , all producer @entity56 ( " @entity44 " ) would likely need to do is hook an a-list star to play @entity13 — and perhaps another a-lister as @entity20 — and he could be well on his way to a greenlight			1
so who could play @entity13 and @entity20 ? we held several envelopes to our heads and came up with a list of prospective actors , some more obvious than others			1
check out our list below : @entity13 @entity72 : which is the best @entity75 movie ? @entity76 : it 's actually kinda unfair to start with @entity76 , because anyone who saw his @entity13 imitation on @entity80 with @entity81 knows the oscar - winner has the guy nailed			1
watch it here , and marvel			2
basically , this role is @entity76 's to lose			0
@entity86 : crack comic timing and a wry deadpan delivery ? check			0
plus , it would be really nice to see @entity86 in a film where the biggest fight scenes involve @entity92			0
@entity93 : he understands the power of @entity13 better than most : he bombed in very first appearance on @entity30 television doing a meta @entity98 impression on @entity18			1
plus , @entity93 's performance as @entity100 in @entity101 has already proven he can bridge the gap between an imitation and a lived - in performance			0
@entity105 : there may not be a better impressionist working today , and the " @entity109 " mvp is long overdue for a breakout feature film role			0
@entity20 @entity111 : especially if producers go with a non-comedian for the @entity13 role , @entity112 could bring some welcome comedy chops to the production			2
@entity118 : as @entity119 in @entity121 's @entity120 , @entity118 showed he is a crackerjack mimic — and his snl hosting gig earlier this year proved he 's no slouch at comedy either			0
@entity126 : he knows this role better than most , having played hapless sidekick @entity128 on @entity129 's brilliant late night send - up " the @entity130			0
" plus , his baritone would be perfect saying " @entity133 's @entity17 ! " @entity105 : he 's such a versatile impressionist , @entity105 could play both @entity13 and @entity20			2
