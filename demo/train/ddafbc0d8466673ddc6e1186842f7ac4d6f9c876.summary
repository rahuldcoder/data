at @entity3 's labs in @entity4 , a group of 70 chemists has been working for a decade to try and crack the mysteries of @entity7 medicine			1
the company 's scientists are attempting to break 1,300 medicinal herbs into their component parts and then test them for global use against diseases			0
it 's an ambitious effort and one that looks close to paying off			0
@entity3 , in partnership with @entity17 , has started the first worldwide phase iii clinical testing trials -- the final step before approval for sale -- for a botanical drug based on @entity24			1
if @entity3 and @entity17 succeed in winning @entity27 ( @entity27 ) approval , the companies will be at the forefront of efforts to export @entity7 medicine beyond its loyal following at home			1
they 'll also have tackled the central problem in taking @entity7 medicine global : how do you get a centuries - old remedy through the rigors of modern government regulation ? " the simpler the product , the better at this stage , " says @entity3 ceo @entity38			1
" the more similar it is to conventional drugs , the better from the @entity27 standpoint			2
" that 's why the company has started with a drug called @entity47 , which treats inflammatory bowel disease ( @entity49 ) including ulcerative colitis and crohn 's disease			2
the testing was made possible by a change in the @entity27 policies and procedures in 2004 regarding botanical drug products			0
the new guidelines removed some of the obstacles involved in getting an investigational new drug application ( @entity61 ) , the first step in getting a drug developed and marketed in the @entity64 since the guidelines were introduced , the @entity27 has only approved two botanical drugs , according to the @entity64 @entity66			0
@entity67 , an antidiarrheal drug used for hiv / aids patients and derived from the red sap of the @entity72 plant , was approved in december 2012			0
@entity73 , a treatment for warts based on green tea extract , was given the green light in 2006			0
by @entity7 medicine standards , @entity47 is a simple drug			1
it 's a single extract from a single herb , called andrographis , which has a long history of use in @entity85 for stomach problems			1
contrast that with @entity87 , one of @entity3 's primary products in @entity7			1
it 's a prescription cardiovascular drug with over 100 different chemical components , which @entity38 explains makes it nearly impossible to get through the current @entity64 approval system			0
" if you are working with the @entity27 to register that , you are going to have to explain to them exactly where each of those compounds comes from and you are going to have to guarantee every step that exactly the same amount of the compound is in that product , " he says			2
there are currently 2,800 patients in the @entity105 clinical trials to determine if @entity47 is both safe and effective			1
if @entity27 agrees with the results , the drug will then enter the $ 7 billion global market to treat @entity49			1
@entity3 is not alone in its efforts to take @entity7 botanical drugs beyond @entity7			2
dr. @entity111 at @entity113 's @entity112 is studying the effectiveness of @entity7 medicine treatments for cancer and liver disease			1
he says the lack of advanced science and technology has meant in the past that traditional @entity7 medical doctors did not understand how the treatments worked			0
" we know this works for some disease , but i do n't know what the scientific basis is , " he says			0
" why does it work for this disease ? " dr. @entity111 believes all of that is changing now			0
both he and @entity38 think the slowing pace of conventional drug development is driving more people to look to @entity7 medicine			1
" now new drug discovery from natural products and other material is more difficult that many years ago , people notice the wisdom in @entity7 medicine , " says dr. @entity111			1
he 's particularly hopeful people outside @entity7 will begin to see the value in @entity7 's more complicated , multi-ingredient treatments			2
in fact , he sees these multi-faceted remedies as one of the major assets of @entity7 medicine			2
dr. @entity38 believes gradually the foreign regulators will become more open to the range of @entity7 drugs			0
" it is in the best interest for the public health to be bringing these therapies to the market , " he says .			0
