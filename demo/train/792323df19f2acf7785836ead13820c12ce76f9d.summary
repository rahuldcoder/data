-- when a street artist paints a mural on a wall , who owns the artwork ? by saturday evening , the answer could be " someone else , " at least in the case of " @entity9 , " a work of renowned artist @entity11			1
the mural showed up on the wall of a @entity15 discount store in @entity18 's @entity17 neighborhood during the queen 's jubilee last may			1
it depicts a young boy sewing @entity24 flags and was thought to be a commentary on sweatshop labor , something that hit home in the working class neighborhood			2
" it represents the struggle of the community in general , " one resident told the @entity31			2
and it was something positive for locals			1
" i felt a twinge of pride that something other than cheap tat was drawing people to our high road			1
" it brought much - needed positive attention to @entity49 instead of the usual ugly image often spread in the news and on @entity52 , " @entity45 wrote in @entity46 & @entity47			1
but last week , residents noticed some work was being done around the 4 - foot - by - 5 - foot mural , with scaffolding and a tarpaulin put up			1
" this morning i had a sneaky look under said tarpaulin to find it had been removed , " wrote blogger @entity58 on @entity60			2
" i spoke to the guy rendering the wall and he said that after repeated attempts to gouge it out , the owner of the @entity15 building had decided to take steps to ' preserve ' it			0
" the preservation seems to have taken the piece to @entity73 , where " @entity9 " has turned up in the catalog of @entity75 in @entity73			1
it 's expected to go under the gavel on saturday with a price range of $ 500,000 to $ 700,000 as part of a collection of " @entity81 " that has the @entity18 locals angry			1
" @entity11 gave that piece of art to our community , " local council member @entity84 is quoted as saying by the @entity31			1
he called the artwork a " piece of art that was given freely has been taken away from them			0
" not so , said the @entity73 auctioneer			0
" some people in @entity95 are complaining that the work had been stolen			0
that 's absolutely incorrect because the work was painted on a private wall and the owner of a private wall can do whatever he wants with his own wall , " @entity97 said in a @entity31 interview			0
" we take a lot of care with our consignors , who they are , what they do , and if there 's any illegality we will not touch it			0
everything is checked out 150 % , " the @entity114 quoted @entity97 as saying			0
for its part @entity15 tweeted that it is not responsible for removing the art			0
" we do not own the building			0
it is not ours to remove , " the store tweeted			2
" we 've been unable to reach landlord 's agents today but would like to reiterate that we in no way condone the artwork removal , " another tweet said			0
@entity11 himself is known to be reclusive and has made no official comment on the controversy			1
but on the frequently asked questions page of his website , he poses the question : " what do you think about the auction houses selling street art ? " he quotes artist @entity142 for his answer : " i was very embarrassed when my canvases began to fetch high prices , i saw myself condemned to a future of painting nothing but masterpieces			2

4 - foot - by - 5 - foot @entity11 mural was on @entity18 store
mural was point of pride for locals
residents noticed mural was taken away last week
" @entity9 " expected to fetch more than $ 500,000
