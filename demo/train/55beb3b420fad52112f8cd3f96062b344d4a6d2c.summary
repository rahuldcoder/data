-- @entity1 may have 659 million " followers " -- according to a survey conducted two years ago -- but it 's not the biggest club in the world			1
that 's according to the @entity8 ' new manager , @entity7 , who was officially unveiled thursday only days after guiding the @entity9 to third place at the @entity11 in @entity12			1
@entity14 's statement pulled no punches , which is in keeping with the 62 - year - old 's reputation as being a no - nonsense disciplinarian			0
his task is to reverse the fortunes of @entity1 , which last season under @entity22 went from the most dominant side in the @entity25 era to one that could n't even qualify for the often derided @entity27			1
" last year you were seventh so then you are not the biggest club , " @entity7 said			1
however , @entity1 's standing generally was n't lost on @entity7 , whose resume boasts league titles with three @entity34 giants , @entity33 , @entity35 and @entity36			1
in case he needed a reminder of @entity1 's stature , @entity1 legend @entity37 was there thursday to greet him			2
" it 's the biggest club because of how well it 's known around the world , " @entity7 said			1
" when i was in @entity46 or @entity12 , people were talking about @entity1 when i was the coach of the @entity48 team			1
" @entity14 at the helm could be a boon for his compatriot , striker @entity51 , who failed to match his first season at @entity1 in 2012/2013 , yet he still inherits a team in transition			2
@entity55 and @entity56 wo n't be around in the heart of the defense , nor will marauding left - back @entity59			0
but unlike last season 's summer transfer window , @entity1 at least managed to make two major signings early , landing the coveted 19 - year - old @entity64 -- he 'll replace @entity59 -- from @entity65 and long - term creative midfield target @entity66 from @entity68			2
@entity14 was n't about to forecast @entity1 's league position this season			2
@entity1 finished a staggering 22 points behind champion and city rival @entity73			2
" i will do my utmost best , " said @entity7			2
" that 's what i can give			0
i can not give predictions because you never know			0
it 's the biggest club of the world			1
" within two days i know already how important @entity1 is			0
" i have to work , i have to prepare a team , i have to adapt to this big club			0
when you see my career you can see what i have won			0
that 's all i can say			0
" the future shall show if i can do that again			0
" his assistant coaches @entity90 and @entity92 have already been working with the players in advance of his arrival after the @entity11			0
they took the first training session of thursday along with club legend @entity98 , who was in temporary charge after @entity22 ' dismissal at the back end of last season			0
the retention of @entity98 and @entity7 's stated intention thursday that he would find roles for other former players on the @entity1 staff like @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 shows he will not be totally breaking from the past			1
but @entity14 has already suffered an injury blow , as midfielder @entity113 sustained an ankle injury in training and will be sidelined for up to 12 weeks .			1

@entity48 @entity7 is officially unveiled as @entity1 manager
after finishing seventh in @entity121 , van @entity7 says @entity1 not the biggest club
he *bypassed* a *holiday* after the @entity11 and is getting to work at @entity126
in bad news for @entity7 , @entity113 is out after suffering an ankle injury
