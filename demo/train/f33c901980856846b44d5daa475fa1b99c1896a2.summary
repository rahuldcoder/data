@entity0 , @entity1 -- if 63 - year - old @entity1 scholar @entity4 had his way , he would be on hunger strike on june 4 , sitting quietly through the day at @entity7 , 20 minutes ' taxi ride from @entity0 's @entity9			1
@entity4 wants to mark the 20th anniversary of the @entity9 crackdown with a hunger strike			1
his aim : to mark the 20th anniversary of the @entity9 crackdown and to dramatize his defiant call for answers from @entity1 authorities			1
" what is the truth ? " he pressed rhetorically , as he discussed his plans with @entity2 a week earlier			2
" how many people were in fact robbed of their lives ? the truth remains unknown , because the @entity1 government has suppressed information about the truth on june 4th			1
" on that day 20 years ago , @entity1 troops in armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled toward @entity9			2
that was where @entity4 , along with three other intellectuals , including @entity33 singer - composer @entity32 , were on the second day of a hunger strike to show solidarity with student protesters			1
the soldiers , on strict orders to clear @entity9 of demonstrators , had forced their way through the city 's main thoroughfare			0
along the way , they met fierce resistance from students and city residents who barricaded the streets , so they fired at them			0
when the firing stopped , hundreds if not thousands of people lay maimed or dead			0
a few hours past midnight on june 4 , @entity4 and the protesters on the square found themselves surrounded by troops and tanks , and yet several holdouts wanted to " resist till death			1
" sensing a sure bloodbath , @entity4 and @entity32 appeased the hotheads and took control of their ranks			1
gingerly , the two approached army officers and negotiated an agreement that allowed the demonstrators to withdraw peacefully			2
after they dispersed , some stayed home , some were arrested , and others became fugitives			0
three days later , @entity4 went into hiding after he learned that the computer company he worked for as a policy planner had become the target of a witch hunt			2
weeks later , police caught the bespectacled sociologist			0
he was detained but was not formally charged or tried			0
he was released months later			0
any regrets ? " none at all , " @entity4 said firmly			1
" i would regret enormously if i had n't done what i did and if had n't saved the lives of so many people ( on the square )			0
this single reason is enough			0
had i not done that , i would be hitting my head against the wall every day			0
" despite the painful memories , @entity4 said , he remains cautiously optimistic about how grassroots activism has grown in @entity1			1
" there is a huge difference now compared with 20 years ago , " @entity4 told @entity2 two weeks before the june 4 anniversary			1
" i think the citizens are becoming more aware of their rights			0
it 's especially shown in the ranks of the @entity97 ( nongovernment organizations ) , lawyers and intellectuals			0
this is an important sign that the citizens ' consciousness has waken up in @entity1			2
" accordingly , @entity4 has sought to abide by laws and regulations			2
a week before the june 4 anniversary , @entity4 prepared to drive to a police station to apply for a permit to conduct his day - long hunger strike			1
he wrote an application , even detailing that he would simply sit quietly in the park , carrying a banner that would read : " publicize the truth of june 4 -- reach the goal of reconciliation of society ! " but @entity4 did not even make it to the station			1
police showed up at his home and talked him and his wife into going along with them for a " vacation " at a government - owned hostel			2
reached by phone on june 3 , @entity4 's wife said good - naturedly : " we are both fine			1
we are having a good time teaching the police about democracy			0
" she said they expected to return to the city a week later , after the june 4 anniversary jitters had subsided .			0

@entity4 : " @entity1 government has suppressed information about the truth on june 4th "
he and another , @entity32 , negotiated deal allowing protesters to leave peacefully
no regrets , @entity4 says
he remains cautiously optimistic about grassroots activism
