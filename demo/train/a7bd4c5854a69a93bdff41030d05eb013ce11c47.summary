-- president @entity2 's decision to order a raid against @entity4 in @entity5 was a courageous and gutsy call , said @entity8 defense secretary @entity7			1
" i 've worked for a lot of these guys and this is one of the most courageous calls -- decisions -- that i think i 've ever seen a president make , " he said during a @entity11 " @entity10 " interview that aired sunday night			2
" it was a very gutsy call			2
" the outgoing defense secretary said he had " real reservations " about the intelligence surrounding the raid			1
" i was very concerned , frankly , " he said			0
" my worry was the level of uncertainty about whether @entity4 was even in the compound			0
there was n't any direct evidence that he was there			0
it was all circumstantial , but it was the best information that we had since probably 2001			0
" @entity8 officials had tracked a trusted @entity4 courier for years , who they believed was living with and protecting the @entity37 leader			2
they were confident the courier lived at the @entity5 compound , but were not certain that @entity4 lived there too			0
the courier and his brother were among those killed in the raid			0
@entity7 said it would be " premature " to talk about whether @entity4 's death could accelerate the withdrawal of @entity8 troops from @entity49 , now slated to start in july , but said he believes the @entity8 is gaining the upper hand there			1
" we have over the last 18 months put in place , for the first time , the resources necessary to ensure that this threat does not rebuild -- does not re-emerge -- once we 're gone			0
i think we could be in a position by the end of this year where we have turned the corner in @entity49 , " he said			2
@entity7 , the only @entity59 member from the previous administration to stay on when @entity2 came into office , is expected to step down this year			1
former president @entity62 nominated @entity7 as the nation 's 22nd secretary of defense in december 2006 to replace @entity65 , one of the architects of the @entity68 war			1
during the early months of his tenure , @entity7 focused on implementing the " troop surge " in @entity68 , a strategy change that was under consideration before he became secretary			1
it called for increasing the number of troops in @entity68 and focusing their efforts in @entity78			0
the goal was to have @entity68 troops take the lead in military matters and allow political progress to proceed by isolating extremists			0
although many on both sides of the political spectrum opposed the idea of 20,000 more @entity8 troops in @entity68 , by 2008 violence declined , and @entity7 began overseeing the withdrawal of @entity8 troops from the country , an endeavor that continues			1
" i think had we left here with our tail between our legs , and with chaos , it would have been very bad for our army and for our military , " he said			0
still , @entity7 told @entity11 that he was worried the @entity8 would be " penny-wise and pound - foolish " in @entity68 in the months and years to come			1
the defense secretary also lashed out at the institution he runs during the wide - ranging interview , criticizing @entity107 bureaucracy			1
" i think the hardest thing for me to deal with is leading a department that is organized to plan for war but not to fight a war			0
and so everything that i wanted to do to try to help the men and women in the field , i 've had to do outside the normal @entity107 bureaucracy ... that 's been very frustrating , " he said			1
" i 've ruffled a few feathers at all the institutions i 've led , but i think that 's part of leadership			2
