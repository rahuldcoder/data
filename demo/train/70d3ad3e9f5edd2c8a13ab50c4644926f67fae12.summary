when the bell rings it makes a clucking sound — well , not really , but it looks like it should			0
@entity63 : @entity65 's coolest futuristic buildings @entity28 , @entity30 in the late 1980s , many architects were obsessed with @entity68 columns			1
@entity24 felt that postmodernists were n't looking back far enough			1
he surmised that we are all descended from fish and , for the @entity72 , set about creating a structure near the @entity74 that would reflect our 300 - million - year - old ancestor			1

@entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 this ingenious preschool is so adorable that it makes any work seem like play			0

@entity63 : cutest baby animals at @entity100 zoos @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 about two hours east of @entity107 , on the drive toward the @entity106 border , is a roadside attraction worth a detour			0
local artist @entity110 designed an observation tower from boulders painted to look like a cow reclining in a field			0
upon climbing the squat tower , travelers are rewarded with a view of real - life cows reclining similarly in green pastures			2
@entity120 , @entity20 you 'd have to have a thick hide to work in the 335 - foot - tall @entity124 , easily a contender for one of the world 's ugliest buildings			1

@entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 @entity154 was the first example of zoomorphic architecture in @entity100 , with the patent to prove it			1
built in 1882 to sell @entity156 real estate , @entity154 then found use as an office , a bar and a summer home			0

to this day , @entity154 stands proudly alone			0
@entity9 , @entity172 , @entity10 upon arrival , you do n't immediately appreciate how true this hotel is to its name : the low - lying , curved corridors could simply be a way to give each room a unique view of the landscape , rich with kangaroos and other wildlife			0
