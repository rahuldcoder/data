@entity0 -- a slim majority of @entity3 think churches should stay out of politics , according to a new survey			1
@entity7 , the rev. @entity8 and @entity9 together for a @entity1 broadcast forum on faith			0
the survey suggests that for the first time in more than a decade , there has been a shift away from the view that religious groups should influence social and political issues			1
fifty - two percent of poll respondents said churches should stay quiet , while 46 percent said churches should express political views			2
the biggest shift has come among @entity26 , one of the authors of the poll said			1
" overall , the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly , but among @entity26 it is up 11 points , and among white evangelical @entity26 it is up 19 points , " said @entity27 , a research fellow at the @entity28			1
" there is a slight uptick , from 40 percent to 46 percent , among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion , but it is up 10 points among @entity26 , " he added			1
four years ago , seven out of 10 conservatives approved of religious institutions expressing political views			0
but five out of 10 conservatives in thursday 's poll said it was appropriate			0
it seems that the more important social issues are to conservatives , the more likely they were to say that religion and politics should not mix. among people who said gay marriage was a very important issue , the number saying houses of worship should keep out of politics doubled , from 25 percent to 50 percent			2
among those who said it was not important , the number was essentially unchanged			0
respondents were also more likely to say houses of worship should not meddle in politics if they considered the major political parties to be hostile to religion			2
the new figures bring @entity26 views into line with those of @entity73 and independents			1
a 14 - point gap between @entity26 and @entity73 views on the subject in august 2004 fell to one point in the new survey			1
but @entity27 cautioned against reading the survey to mean basic conservative philosophy was changing			1
" it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift , " he said			0
" it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion , but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics			1
" " voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all , " @entity27 added			0
@entity26 candidate sen. @entity7 " has a huge lead even among younger evangelicals			1
" but social conservatives are lukewarm about @entity7 as compared to president @entity99			0
nearly seven out of 10 white evangelical protestants and conservatives said they supported @entity7 ; the number was slightly higher for @entity99 in august 2004			0
but four years ago , 57 percent of them said they backed @entity99 strongly			0
the number is 28 percent for @entity7 this year , with 40 percent saying they backed him , but not strongly			0
the number of people who think religious groups have too much influence over political parties grew -- for both @entity26 and @entity73 -- as did the percentage of people who are uncomfortable hearing politicians talk about how religious they are			1
@entity3 continue to see the @entity26 as more friendly to religion than the @entity73 , although the @entity73 closed the gap somewhat since reaching a low point in 2006			1
other survey results showed little change from the past			1
two out of three @entity3 continue to say churches should not endorse candidates for president , and most still feel a president should have strong religious beliefs			1
the survey was conducted by the @entity128 and the @entity28 by interviewing 2,905 adults nationwide by phone between july 31 and august 10			2
on saturday , @entity9 and @entity7 answered questions that had religious overtones at a forum hosted by the rev. @entity8			0
the pastor of @entity136 's @entity135 is author of the best - selling book " @entity137			0
" asked when life begins , @entity7 was quick to say " at the moment of conception			0
" @entity7 's response was met with huge applause from the audience			0
" i have a 25 - year pro-life record in the @entity145 , in the @entity146 , and as president of the @entity3 , i will be a pro-life president , and this presidency will have pro-life policies , " he said			1
when @entity9 was asked about when life begins , the pro-choice candidate said that decision is " above my pay grade			0
" the response garnered criticism from liberal and conservative thinkers who said @entity9 tried to dodge the issue			2
@entity9 said although he 's pro-choice and supports a woman 's right to abortion , his goal is to reduce the number of abortions in @entity3			2
" on this particular issue , if you believe that life begins at conception ... and you are consistent , then i ca n't argue with you on that , " he said			2
" what i can do is say , ' are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies ? ' "			0
