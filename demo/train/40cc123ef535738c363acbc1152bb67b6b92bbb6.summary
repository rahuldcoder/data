@entity0 -- we now know president @entity3 and @entity5 speaker @entity4 agree on at least one thing : in 2014 , keeping the political base happy matters more than advancing once - critical policy initiatives			1
for the @entity16 speaker , a personal commitment to big immigration changes , including a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers , was sacrificed after it became clear there would be a conservative revolt			1
the argument from the right : turning out conservatives is the key to 2014 midterm success , and big immigration changes would anger the base			2
and now the president 's counter move : dropping from his new budget an idea he said was essential just a year ago -- a more modest calculation of inflation adjustments for @entity33			1
then , it was a critical piece of entitlement reform and deficit reduction			0
now , the calculation is simple : liberals hate the idea , and pushing it in 2014 would anger a base the @entity42 need in november			2
when @entity4 retreated on immigration , it was the @entity5 and its allies who said he was being shortsighted and putting politics ahead of the national interest			1
inside politics : @entity4 says ' never mind ' on immigration now , the flipside , from @entity4 's office : " the president has no interest in doing anything , even modest , to address our looming debt crisis			2
... with three years left in office , it seems the president is already throwing in the towel			0
" a bit of hyperbole in that last part -- and the speaker has his own immigration flip - flop as a lesson in context : the president on @entity33 , just like the speaker on immigration , is only throwing in the towel for this year , hoping it puts him in a stronger position politically next year			1
a lot can happen between february and november , but the best bet at this early juncture is that @entity16 keep their @entity5 majority			0
the battle for control of the @entity82 is the big 2014 struggle , and the president has made clear protecting the fragile @entity42 majority there is his top priority			0
organizations focused on deficit reduction and structural budget reforms applauded @entity3 when he embraced the @entity33 shift last year -- it is estimated to save $ 233 billion over a decade			1
those same centrist organizations were quick to criticize his decision to abandon the @entity33 change this year as a clear political shift left			1
" the withdrawal by the president on this specific issue , and his general pivot away from focusing on the nation 's medium and long - term fiscal challenges , reflects a dangerous trend , " the campaign to fix the @entity98 said in a statement after the @entity5 outlined the budget proposal			0
@entity109 : @entity3 drops controversial @entity33 proposal the so - called " chained @entity112 " shift for @entity33 will likely return as a debating point next year anyway , but @entity3 could face even more choices anathema to liberals if the @entity16 manages to take control of the @entity82			1
what 's the big deal about ' chained @entity112 ' ? mindful of the stakes , it 's clear leadership in both parties is moving away from any environment of major policy compromise and toward full scale - election positioning			2
to that end , @entity3 on tuesday attends a @entity129 summit			0
the organization is the grassroots offshoot of the 2008 and 2012 @entity3 presidential campaign			0
the summit goal : try to defy the midterm historical odds and protect @entity42 seats .			0

both @entity3 and @entity4 dropped high - *profile* initiatives to keep base happy
for @entity4 , his commitment to immigration reform was sacrificed
@entity3 dropped his idea to tweak inflation adjustments for @entity33
both moves show a shift to election - year positioning
