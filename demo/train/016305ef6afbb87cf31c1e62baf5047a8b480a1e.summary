after an incredibly busy 2014 , during which health stories like @entity2 , new food nutrition label rules , and the debate about the right to die sparked by @entity6 dominated the headlines , it 's now worth looking at what we may be covering in the next 12 months			2
so , in no particular order , here 's my take on the nine big health stories to watch for , and the questions they will likely raise , in 2015			1
there are n't nearly enough of us to care for the @entity23 population			1
by some estimates , the country is already short of tens of thousands of doctors , a problem that will only get worse as the demand for care increases with our aging population			1
that could mean longer wait times for you when you need to make an appointment			2
but that also means policy makers will have to consider questions like : is there a way to increase the number of residency training slots ? are there other health care professionals who can reasonably fill in the gaps ? will the nation 's quality of care go down ? how can the country avoid a situation where only the wealthy will be able to afford quality care ? hospital errors and infections			1
hospital mistakes and infections are still one of the leading causes of preventable death ( indeed , some studies suggest " hospital - acquired conditions " kill more people than car accidents or diabetes )			2
true , a recent study showed the rate did get better this year , saving tens of thousands of lives			2
but what else can hospitals do to prevent these mistakes and infections ? can technology like e-prescriptions and electronic health records prevent problems that most often occur : the mistakes caregivers make with a patient 's drugs ? antibiotic resistance			0
it has been called public health 's " ticking time bomb			0
" the @entity82 calls antibiotic resistant infections one of the biggest threats to global health today			0
each year , at least 2 million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics , and at least 23,000 people die each year			0
most of these deaths happen in health care settings and in nursing homes			1
how can we respond ? well , research teams around the world have already started searching for the next generation of infection - fighting drugs			0
but it remains to be seen if time will run out , sending us back to the beginning : a time before antibiotics , where even a cut that becomes infected could kill you			0
more do - it - yourself health care : apps and technology			1
technology has made do - it - yourself patient care much easier			1
this goes beyond just a patient 's ability to look up their symptoms online			0
there are apps to help with autism , apps that can simulate a check - up , apps that can monitor conditions			0
wearables can motivate you to walk more or sleep more or check a diabetic 's glucose level			0
but how does all this helping yourself make your health care better ? how much is too much ? and what does this mean for your privacy ? after all , the health care industry accounted for 43 % of all major data breaches in 2013			1
meanwhile , although 93 % of health care data requires protection by law , some surveys suggest only 57 % of it is " somewhat protected			1
" what could this mean for your privacy and personal information if security does n't get better ? food deserts			1
while not everyone agrees with the term food desert , the @entity143 still estimates 23.5 million people live in these urban neighborhoods and rural towns with limited access to fresh , affordable , healthy food			0
without grocery stores in these areas , residents often have to rely on fast food and convenience stores that do n't stock fresh produce			1
it takes a real toll on their health			0
families who live in these areas struggle more with obesity and chronic conditions , and they even die sooner than people who live in neighborhoods with easy access to healthy food			0
more farmers markets are now accepting food stamps and many nonprofits have stepped in to try to bring community gardens and healthy food trucks to these areas , but so far it 's not enough			0
will cities offer incentives to grocery store chains to relocate to these neighborhoods ? how else can this system be helped ? caregivers for the aging population			1
we are heading into a kind of caregiver crisis			0
the number of people 65 years and older is expected to rise 101 % between 2000 and 2030 , yet the number of family members who can provide care for these older adults is only expected to rise 25 %			1
this raises a series of related questions , not least who is going to step up to fill the gaps ? will cities that do n't traditionally have strong public transportation systems add to their routes ? will developers create more mixed - use buildings to make shopping and socializing easier to access ? could the government create a kind of caregiver corps that could check in on the isolated elderly ? who will pay for this expensive kind of safety net ? the cost of @entity210 's			1
currently about 5.2 million @entity23 have @entity210 's			1
that number is expected to double every 20 years			0
with a cure some way off , what can be done to ease the emotional and financial burden on families and communities affected by the disease ? the @entity219 predicts that by 2050 , @entity23 costs for care will total $ 1.2 trillion , making it the most expensive condition in the nation			1
how will we be able to afford the costs of caring for this population ? what can the country do to achieve the goal the @entity231 set for preventing and effectively treating @entity210 's by 2025 ? marijuana			2
with the growing acceptance of weed , we can expect that more laws will change to allow medical and recreational use of marijuana			2
how will the rest of the laws in this country adjust ? for instance , @entity240 is coming up with a breathalyzer - type device to check if drivers are high			0
but it will be interesting to see how readily available these devices are going to be			0
will legalization improve the scientific understanding of the long - term consequences of the drug ? what other uses could this drug have to help those who may need pain relief most ? missing work - life balance			0
@entity23 spend more time on the job than most other developed countries			1
we do n't get as much vacation , we do n't take what vacation we have , and we are prone to working nights and weekends			2
this stress has a negative impact on @entity23 ' health			1
what are companies doing to help ? what technology can change this phenomenon ? will millennials who say work - life balance is a bigger priority than other generations rub off on the rest of us ? what can we personally do to find a better balance ? we may not be able to answer all these questions in 2015 , but we sure will try			2
and the health team and i look forward to exploring these issues with you in the coming @entity282			2
