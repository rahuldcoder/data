there has been a great deal of austerity - bashing -- that is to say @entity4 - bashing -- this @entity6 election season			1
buoyed by his success in the first round , @entity8 candidate @entity7 declared last thursday : " it is not for @entity4 to decide for the rest of @entity13			1
" vowing to reset @entity13 on a growth path , he said , " we 're not just any country , we can change the situation			0
" now he looks set to put his words into action , following his victory in sunday 's runoff election			0
@entity6 president @entity22 was quick to throw off the " @entity24 " mantel early on in his campaigning once he realized that vaunting his friendship with the @entity4 chancellor was the last thing his electorate wanted to hear , but it appears to have been in vain			1
but @entity32 stood by her one - time ally , saying she continued to support him in his re-election bid			1
this came despite increasingly anti-immigrant , protectionist rhetoric from the @entity22 camp in order to appeal to voters on the far - right that must have sit uncomfortably with @entity42			1
much was made of the fact that the @entity4 chancellor 's office has made no official overtures to @entity7			1
the chairman of @entity4 's social democrat party @entity48 called his socialist counterpart in @entity51 a " victim of slander " by the ruling coalition and by @entity32 personally in a recent interview with @entity4 daily @entity54			1
" she knows perfectly well that it is a lie that @entity7 want to scrap the fiscal compact and incur mountains of debt			2
" whether or not she is sure of that , @entity32 has made it quite clear that @entity7 can not scrap the fiscal pact			1
not up for renegotiation , she said			0
but it was also clear that @entity42 recognized the writing on the wall			2
" @entity4 is clever enough to adapt its position to a new political constellation in @entity6 , " said @entity68 from the @entity69 at @entity42 's @entity70			1
" @entity4 are not people to improvise			2
" and @entity32 has already responded with more talk of growth , although she 's at pains to argue this is n't a new position on her part			2
" it is important that we break with the idea that growth always costs a lot of money and must be the result of expensive stimulus programs , " she told the @entity80			0
the way out of this crisis has always rested on two pillars : " solid finances and measures for growth and employment			0
" hollande for his part said if he became president , his first trip would be to @entity42			1
this is a man who does not underestimate the strength of the @entity104 - @entity4 alliance			2
plus he 's of a more similar temperament to the @entity4 chancellor than @entity22 ever was			1
" he 's pragmatic , prepared to compromise , accepts budget discipline and he 'll be under enormous pressure from the markets , " says @entity108 , @entity6 expert at the @entity109			0
" once the summer 's over , once the parliamentary elections have happened , he will have to start saving and he will have to push through reforms			0
" for now , expect small modifications to the fiscal pact but no rewrites			0
" @entity4 will be clever enough to accept little changes in formulation in order to help @entity7 tell @entity6 voters that he 's been victorious , " @entity68 said			1
" but it 's just tactics			0
" @entity32 is already talking about more flexible use of @entity127 infrastucture funds to spur growth , a strengthened role for the @entity130			2
but that is a long way from meeting any future @entity6 leader on proposals such as eurobonds or a @entity136 lending directly to governments , both anathema to @entity42			0
how far the @entity4 chancellor will be forced to compromise to @entity7 's growth mantra may well depend on matters outside @entity6			1
@entity140 was also holding elections on sunday			0
@entity140 voters stung by austerity are turning to extremist parties on the left and right			0
recession is biting across @entity13 , swingeing cuts making electorates restive in @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			0
the more support @entity7 gets from other disgruntled eurozone countries , the less lee - way @entity42 has to stick to its tough belt - tightening course			1
but that is still some way off			0
@entity32 has two crucial state elections coming up in the next two weeks and the @entity160 goes to the polls in september			0
if the past decades are anything to go by , it is more than likely the @entity104 - @entity4 alliance will remain an anchor of stability amid all the uncertainty , whoever holds the reins of power in each country .			2
