-- when i was a boy , my father used to take me by the hand to visit the ruins of the ancient metropolis on the outskirts of our town			0
we would always stop by to visit the huge winged bulls that guarded the gates of the ancient city of @entity13			0
i was scared of the winged bulls , but at the same time , they excited me			0
through them and the site , i learned the stories of the civilization that lived along the @entity20 in what was now @entity22			0
many decades later , i started a technology company that brought the world its first @entity26 laser scanning system and cloud of points software			1
the systems we developed were extremely fast and could rapidly collect millions of points with very high accuracy and very high resolution			1
a surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard - pressed to produce maybe 500 points in a whole day			2
these new systems would produce something like 10,000 points a second			0
as you can imagine , this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction businesses , as well as in the reality capture industry			1
@entity46 : experiments that hint of longer lives in 2001 , @entity49 was acquired by @entity50			0
right around that time , a terrible tragedy happened : the magnificent 160 - foot - tall buddhas in the @entity53 in @entity54 were blown up by the @entity55			0
they were gone in an instant			0
unfortunately , there was no detailed record of the site			0
this devastated me , and i could n't help but wonder about the fate of my old friends , the winged bulls , and the fate of heritage sites all over the world			1
my wife and i decided to start a project to digitally preserve world heritage sites			1
we called the project @entity73 , which stands for @entity76			1
@entity73 is now an international nonprofit organization			1
with the help of a global network of partners , we 've completed more than 50 projects to date , including @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			0
@entity73 uses @entity26 digital documentation , archiving and the dissemination of the data to tell the story of the sites and engage the public			1
we are losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them			1
natural phenomena take their toll , but it has become clear that human causes are a significant part of the reason for their destruction			2
@entity46 : how algorithms shape our world we 're fighting a losing battle			1
not only are we losing the sites , we 're losing a significant piece of our collective memory			1
imagine the human race not knowing where we came from			0
because of the accelerated pace of destruction , we created a project we call the @entity115 -- to digitally preserve 500 world heritage sites in five years			1
to me , the 500 is really just the first 500			2
to sustain our work , we take the technology to local universities and colleges			2
they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites , and at the same time , they get the benefit of learning a technology they can use in the future			1
two years ago , we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site , a @entity134 heritage site in @entity135 , the @entity136			2
the work was done successfully in the field , and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the @entity73 website			2
last march , we received very sad news			0
the @entity142 had been destroyed by suspected arson			0
a few days later , we received a call : " is the data available , and can it be used for reconstruction ? " our answer , of course , was yes			0
our heritage is much more than our collective memory -- it 's our collective treasure			1
we owe it to our children , our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

@entity159 : @entity162 's most *historic* , treasured sites are always at risk of destruction
he says technology developed for the construction industry can rapidly digitize sites
@entity171 's nonprofit @entity73 is preserving 500 world heritage sites
he says the world is at risk of losing its collective memory and heritage
