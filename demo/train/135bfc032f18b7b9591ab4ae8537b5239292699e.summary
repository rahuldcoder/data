@entity0 , a mechanic , was making a routine repair on a client 's car when his phone rang			1
it was a phone call that would change his life forever			2
" i was called in the morning by my elder brother notifying me of an attack on the school where my daughter was schooling , " he said			2
@entity0 's blood went cold as his brother continued , telling him that some of the girls had been abducted by @entity16			1
@entity0 knew only too well the vicious and brutal nature of the terrorist group : just a few months before this , @entity16 had attacked his village in northeastern @entity21			1
armed men forced him out of his house and one of them pointed a gun to his head			0
by a sheer miracle , unexplainable even to @entity0 , one of the militants intervened , and his life was spared			1
their entire village was razed to the ground and so @entity0 moved his family to @entity35 and enrolled his eldest daughter @entity36 into the @entity37 so that she could sit for her final high school exam			1
he chose @entity35 because not only was it his ancestral home and he had relatives there but also because it had no history of @entity16 attacks			1
he felt it was safe -- until now			0
later in the day @entity0 's brother phoned him again			1
" then before sunset he called me again , and informed me that my daughter was part of those that were taken by @entity16			1
" his wife @entity49 says the news of her daughter 's abduction tore at her heart			1
she refused to believe it when her husband first told it to her -- until it was confirmed on the evening news			0
" seriously , seriously , mum and her daughter			2
the pain is indescribable , " she reflects			0
@entity49 says there is not a day that goes by that she does think of her daughter			1
she describes her daughter as an ambitious girl who saw education as a way out of poverty			2
" she used to tell me one day she will finish school and become somebody			2
she used to assist the younger ones with their homework , " she said " she loved studies			0
she used to fall asleep with her books in her arms , " she added			0
her father remembers her as the caring eldest child who used to secretly collect his dirty clothes , wash them and press them for him			0
he also remembers her passion for knowledge			0
always she loved going to school , " he said			0
inside their small one roomed house -- there is nothing to indicate that the @entity92 festive season has begun			0
they say @entity92 used to be a time of laughter and spending time with family			2
" every @entity92 we used to be complete and happy but now one of us is not there , how can it be the same ? " asks @entity0			1
" there is nothing i can say			0
it is a bad @entity92			0
but there is nothing we can do , " says @entity49			1
a sadness surrounds the couple as they clutch to the only physical memory that they have of their daughter -- a few photos and one bright green top , one of her favorites			1
but although they are at low spirits , they say their hopes remain high that their daughter will come back			1
they pass on that encouragement to their other five children who say they miss their sister			0
" her siblings know that she is not here -- they themselves know what is happening , having come out of war , " says @entity0			2
" they keep asking me , ' when is she coming back ? ' but i keep telling them to keep trusting @entity135			0
maybe he will hear us , " he adds .			0
