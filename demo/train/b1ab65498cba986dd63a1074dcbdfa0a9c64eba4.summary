@entity0 , @entity1 -- the aliens have landed -- and they look rather fabulous			1
centuries rolled forward and outfits got quirkier in the heart of @entity0 late last month as @entity1 fashion designer @entity7 showed off her futuristic creations for her latest collection , " @entity10			1
" set in 2244 , the dazzling show transformed @entity0 's 100 - year - old deserted train station into a whimsical space where humans co-existed alongside strange and mysterious creatures -- from alien invaders and giant metallic insects to a massive inflatable octopus whose glowing tentacles stretched throughout the historic building			1
" @entity10 is a story about an @entity25 invaded city where weird , fantastic and sci - fi creatures evolve among human beings , " says @entity22			1
" my collection is an answer to what the consequences of the invasion would be on women 's and men 's wardrobes , on music , on architecture -- what would that city look like ? what would its inhabitants wear ? " ' surreal universe ' the answers were both eye - catching and grandiose			2
more than just a fashion show , " @entity10 " brought together nearly 120 models , actors , musicians and art performers who created an otherworldly experience for some 2,000 spectators			2

blending urban culture with strong pop art influences , @entity22 's structured creations nodded to the fantasy worlds staged by directors like @entity73 , while being firmly rooted in @entity0			1
" it was important to confront the @entity1 audience with a fashion point of view that is alternative , playful and inhabited by that surreal universe , " says @entity22			1
passion for fashion the talented designer is part of an exciting and ambitious generation of young @entity1 artists that want to share their creative visions both locally and internationally			1
a member of the artistic collective " @entity88 , " @entity22 first started drawing clothes at a young age while growing up in @entity0			1
after high school , she went on to study business and law but her love for fashion never wavered -- in 2008 , @entity22 created her first collection and two years later she headed to @entity98 for fashion studies			2
she then returned to @entity1 and in 2012 @entity22 presented her " @entity106 " collection , a massive urban decor production that paid tribute to street art through music and cinema			1
" i have very strong cinematographic references , " says the young designer on a hot may afternoon , sitting inside the @entity88 compound in a dusty neighborhood of southwestern @entity0			2
" i am addicted to everything that makes me leave @entity112 and discover other things , other realities , " adds @entity22			0
" from my first fashion show and the first time i 've presented my collection there has been a small evolution and everything is going to that path ; that fantastic and surreal approach of what a garment is			0
" ' this is who i am ' that journey culminated last month with " @entity10 " and now @entity22 says she 's determined to continue developing her brand and collaborating with other artists			1
yet , the road has not always been free of hurdles			0
" fashion in other countries is more organized , " says @entity22			2
" when you are a young designer [ abroad ] you know where you have to go , where you have to produce your pieces , where you can distribute it			0
everything is organized , and here you have to do it yourself			0
" she quickly adds , however , that these challenges only serve to motivate her to push her boundaries and work harder			0
" this is who i am , this is where i live and it 's important for me to do it here , " says @entity22			0
" i have the feeling it really matters -- it really inspires other people and i am inspired as well by the people surrounding me , " she says			0
" it makes sense to do it here , on the continent , and after , maybe when we get bigger , go somewhere [ else ] -- but we have a duty to develop things from here			0
