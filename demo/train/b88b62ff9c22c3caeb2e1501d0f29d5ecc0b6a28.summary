@entity1 ' widow is suing @entity2 for the fatal accident that claimed the lives of her race car driver husband and actor @entity5			1
@entity7 filed the suit this week against @entity9 , citing negligence as the cause of death of her husband and the 40 - year - old " @entity18 " star on november 30 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
backed by celebrity attorney @entity19 , she is also suing for product liability and wrongful death			1
@entity1 , 38 at the time of his death , spent his competitive racing career driving @entity2 cars			1
according to the court documents , he and @entity5 first met on the race track when @entity1 was driving a @entity2 owned by the actor			1

" although mr. @entity1 had a passion for cars , mr. @entity1 was first and foremost dedicated to his family , his wife , @entity7 , and their two young children , " the complaint states			2

the complaint argues that such a high - powered sports car should have a higher standard of crash protection , and that a mechanical malfunction forced @entity1 to veer off the road			1
@entity19 also hired investigators to evaluate wreckage at the scene , who determined that @entity1 was driving 55 mph before the vehicle went out of control			2
this contradicts the @entity56 coroner 's report that car was speeding at more than 100 mph , and the investigations by the @entity59 and @entity60 that focused on speed			0
