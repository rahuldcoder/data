-- " @entity5 " author @entity1 returns to her roots with her latest foray into fiction			1
in " the @entity7 , " @entity6 focuses on a 19th - century female botanist who specializes in moss			1
she says it took more than three years to research and write the novel , which spans generations and continents			0
in her free time , @entity6 stays loyal to the passions she immortalized in her best - selling memoir : yoga , travel and her husband , played memorably by @entity22 in the movie version of " @entity5			1
" the 2006 book about her journey through @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 brought her fame and fortune			2
she followed it up with " committed , " an exploration of the institution of marriage , inspired by her decision to wed the man she met during her travels , after a contentious divorce and swearing off matrimony			0
she spoke to @entity0 about her new book , and its famous predecessor , in her familiar voice			2
below is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : how does it feel as a writer to have your books compared when they 're so completely different ? @entity1 : it 's inevitable that readers who came to know me , and who know my passions and my interests , will see aspects of me			1
if they 're looking for it , they 'll find me in there			2
they 'll find some familiar themes			0
it 's about a woman 's journey of discovery			2
it 's about a woman who 's passionate about her work			2
it 's about a woman who 's passionate about the world			2
all that stuff will be familiar to readers of " @entity5			1
" it does n't bother me			2
i 'm not offended by it , because i 'm not writing this book to try to get away from " @entity5			1
" i 'm writing this book to try to do something entertaining for myself and for my readers			2
@entity0 : how did you decide to go back to your roots as a fiction writer ? @entity6 : to a large extent , what i did writing " @entity5 , " and certainly a bit with " committed " as well , all of that was so that i could do this			1
my life had gotten so messed up in my early 30s , after my divorce and this period of depression that i went through , that the idea of being the creative writer that i always wanted to be just fled from me			1
i think the simplest way to describe it is that you ca n't invent drama when you 're living drama			1
one of the things that i wanted to do by getting my life in order was to return myself to a place of calmness and stability , where i could do something like take on a book of this scope			1
so in many ways , this book is kind of a celebration of the result of " @entity5 " : the result of finding a good relationship and getting out of my own way and clearing out all that space so that i could be the writer i 've always wanted to be			1
@entity0 : how did you go about doing all the research on the places and the time ? @entity6 : i just got so lucky after " @entity5 , " i had all these resources and all this freedom to be able to fund whatever i wanted to do with my life			1
and so i was able to throw myself into three years of study about 19th - century botany			1
for me , that 's joyful and exciting and interesting			2
and it felt like a real tribute to the freedom that i had to be able to do that			0
and it was intimidating , because i did n't really know that much about the period , and i did n't really that much about the plant adventures of that day			1
but on the other hand , i 'm such a geek			0
i just got to really full - on geek out about learning all that stuff , which was very exciting			0
@entity0 : did the joy in this writing process come from your personal life ? @entity6 : i 'm getting smarter as i get older			1
i 'm enjoying my 40s so much more than i enjoyed any other period in my life			1
i had a friend who told that me your 40s are such a wonderful time because you start to get out of your own way and get over yourself			0
and that has certainly been the case for me			0
i do n't have much nostalgia for my 20s and 30s			0
it 's just a really nice time			0
i 'm in a really supportive marriage			0
my husband is a great champion of me and my work			0
this book was also probably one of the sweetest intimacies of our marriage , because i wrote it in several months in a big burst , and every night , he would come into my office and sit down with a glass of wine , and i would read to him what i had written that day			0
i felt his excitement , and that compelled me to write faster			0
and it became this lovely private thing that we were doing together			0
and i think his influence shaped the book as well			0
@entity0 : what 's your next project ? @entity6 : i think i 'm going to stick with fiction			1
i had such a good time with this , i do n't want to let go of it yet			0
having been in the corseted , buttoned - up , repressed 19th century , i want to move into the early 20th century and write a novel about girls behaving recklessly			1
take off those corsets .			0
