the @entity0 gave limited approval on monday to public prayers at a @entity4 's board meetings , citing the country 's history of religious acknowledgment in the legislature			1
the 5 - 4 ruling came in yet another contentious case over the intersection of faith and the civic arena			1
it was confined to the specific circumstances and offered few bright - line rules on how other communities should offer civic prayers without violating the @entity19			1
two local women sued officials in @entity22 , @entity23 , objecting to invocations at monthly public sessions on government property			1
the invocations , according to the plaintiffs , have been overwhelmingly @entity29 in nature over the years			2
" the town of @entity22 does not violate the @entity33 by opening its meetings with prayer that comports with our tradition , " justice @entity31 said , " and does not coerce participation by nonadherents			1
" just moments before the opinion was announced from the bench , the high court began its public session as it has for decades : with the marshal invoking a traditional statement that ends , " @entity46 save the @entity47 and this honorable court			1
" the several hundred people in attendance , along with the justices , stood for the brief ceremony			0
the conservative majority offered varying interpretations of when such " ceremonial " prayers would be permissible			0
@entity31 , along with chief justice @entity56 and justice @entity57 , focused on the specifics of the @entity22 case and did not offer a broad expansion of legislative prayer			1
fellow conservative justices @entity62 and @entity64 went further , suggesting that even any " subtle pressure " that local citizens might feel would not be enough to ban such prayers			2
in dissent , justice @entity68 said , " when the citizens of this country approach their government , they do so only as @entity47 , not as members of one faith or another			2
and that means that even in a partly legislative body , they should not confront government - sponsored worship that divides them along religious lines			1
" ' it 's just not appropriate ' the town of about 94,000 residents outside @entity85 began allowing prayers to start its meetings in 1999 , after years of having a " moment of silence			1
" co-plaintiffs @entity89 and @entity90 challenged the revised policy , saying officials repeatedly ignored their requests to modify or eliminate the practice , or at least make it more inclusive			0
" it 's very divisive when you bring government into religion , " @entity89 told @entity96 from her home			0
" i do n't believe in @entity46 , and @entity90 is @entity102 , so to hear these ministers talk about @entity104 and even have some of them who personally question our motives , it 's just not appropriate			0
" the town government counters that after concerns from the two women and others , it sought diverse voices , including a wiccan priestess , to offer invocations			1
officials say they do not review the content of the remarks , nor censor any language			0
" the faith of the prayer giver does not matter at all , " said @entity121 , @entity22 's board supervisor , who began the practice shortly after taking office			1
" we accept anyone who wants to come in and volunteer to give the prayer to open up our town meetings			2
" a federal appeals court in @entity23 found the board 's policy to be a violation of the @entity19 's @entity134 , which forbids any government " endorsement " of religion			1
those judges said it had the effect of " affiliating the town with @entity142			0
" @entity144 and state legislatures regularly open their sessions with a prayer			0
the question in part before the court is whether local government bodies are different , in that there might be more active involvement with local residents , who may want to personally petition the town in zoning , tax and other matters			1
@entity68 suggested the court 's ruling could lead to sectarian prayers at such government venues as trials , polling places , and naturalization ceremonies			1
but @entity57 expressed concern " some readers will take these hypotheticals as a warning that this is where today 's decision leads -- to a country in which religious minorities are denied the equal benefits of citizenship			0
" " nothing could be further from the truth , " added @entity57			0
" all that the court does today is to allow a town to follow a practice that we have previously held is permissible for @entity144 and state legislatures			2
" widely varying interpretations nearly 120 members of @entity144 , mostly @entity182 , along with 18 state attorneys general , filed supporting legal briefs backing the city			0
the @entity187 administration did the same			0
the high court has generally taken a case - by - case approach on determining just when the state intrudes unconstitutionally into religion , while generally allowing faith to be acknowledged in a limited basis in a public forum			1
" @entity205 " remains on currency ; the @entity198 and oaths of office mention a creator ; and menorah and cr√®che displays are permitted in local parks			0
but the justices , in their widely varying interpretations of this case , acknowledged the tricky line they must walk -- politically , socially , legally -- when deciding @entity134 appeals			0
it was @entity31 's views that ultimately controlled			0
" by inviting ministers to serve as chaplain for the month , and welcoming them to the front of the room alongside civic leaders , the town is acknowledging the central place that religion , and religious institutions , hold in the lives of those present , " he said			2
" indeed , some congregations are not simply spiritual homes for town residents but also the provider of social services for citizens regardless of their beliefs			2
" the @entity230 , which represented the town in court , agreed			2
" the @entity0 has again affirmed that @entity47 are free to pray , " said the group 's senior counsel @entity233			0
" in @entity47 , we tolerate a diversity of opinions and beliefs ; we do n't silence people or try to separate what they say from what they believe			0
" but the @entity242 said it was disappointed			0
" official religious favoritism should be off - limits under the @entity19 , " said the group 's @entity244			2
" town - sponsored sectarian prayer violates the basic rule requiring the government to stay neutral on matters of faith			1
" the case of @entity22 , @entity23 v. @entity90 ( 12 - 696 )			1
belief blog : do religious minorities have a prayer ? in november : top court not likely to block town prayers			1

two residents of @entity22 , @entity23 , objected to invocations at town board meetings
opening meetings with traditional prayer does n't violate @entity33 , high court says
@entity268 warns of " government - sponsored worship that divides " citizens " along religious lines "
ruling offers little on how other communities should offer civic prayers
