as expected , the @entity0 has agreed to decide the constitutionality of the sweeping health care reform law championed by president @entity3			1
the justices made their announcement in a brief order issued monday			2
oral arguments are likely to be held in late february or march , with a ruling by june , assuring the blockbuster issue will become a hot - button political debate in a presidential election year			1
the high court agreed to hear two major questions : whether the law 's key provision is unconstitutional , and if so , whether the entire law , with its 450 sections , must be scrapped			1
five and a half hours of oral arguments have been scheduled			0
other related cases are pending and may also be added to the docket			0
the largest and broadest legal challenge to the @entity22 comes from a joint filing by 26 states , led by @entity25			0
it was that series of appeals the high court accepted for review			0
at issue is whether the " individual mandate " section -- requiring nearly all @entity35 to buy health insurance by 2014 or face financial penalties -- is an improper exercise of federal authority			1
the states also say that if that linchpin provision is unconstitutional , the entire law must be also go			2
joining @entity25 in the challenge are @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			0
@entity67 and @entity68 have filed separate challenges , along with other groups and individuals opposed to the law			1
" we know the @entity22 is constitutional and are confident the @entity0 will agree , " said @entity74 communications director @entity73 in a news release issued after the court made its announcement			1
the justices made a calculated call to address the broader issues of the reach of federal authority and the power of @entity85 to enact this kind of legislation			2
@entity88 : political implications could be huge the @entity90 of @entity91 , a key player in opposing the law , said it is pleased the court will address the larger issues			1
" for the small - business community , this comes not a day too soon , " said @entity97 , the group 's ceo			2
" the health care law has not lived up to its promises of reducing costs , allowing citizens to keep their coverage or improving a cumbersome system that has long been a burden to small - business owners and employees , alike			1
the small - business community can now have hope ; their voices are going to be heard in the nation 's highest court			0
" many provisions of the law have not yet taken effect , but the @entity74 , in its release , said that under the provisions that have , " one million more young @entity35 have health insurance , women are getting mammograms and preventive services without paying an extra penny out of their own pocket , and insurance companies have to spend more of your premiums on health care instead of advertising and bonuses			1
" three federal appeals courts have found the @entity22 to be constitutional , while another has said it is not , labeling it " breathtaking in its expansive scope			1
" that " circuit split " all but assured the @entity0 would step in and decide the matter			2
@entity25 and other @entity138 - led states had urged the high court to intervene			0
" this health care law is an affront on @entity35 ' individual liberty , and we will not allow the federal government to violate our constitutional rights , " said the state 's attorney general , @entity140			1
" our country urgently needs a final ruling from the @entity35 @entity0			1
" the states say individuals can not be forced to buy insurance , a " product " they may neither want nor need			0
the @entity155 had countered the states ' argument by saying that since every @entity35 will need medical care at some point in their lives , individuals do not " choose " to participate in the health care market			1
federal officials cite 2008 figures of $ 43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services , costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers			0
the coalition of states is asking the court to decide three fundamental questions : -- whether the entire law must fail because its centerpiece -- the individual mandate -- is unconstitutional			1
-- whether states can be forced by the federal government to expand their share of @entity182 costs and administration , with the risk of losing that funding if they refuse			0
-- whether state employees can receive a federally mandated level of health insurance coverage			0
the legislation was heavily promoted by @entity3 in his first year in office			0
supporters say it would extend health coverage to about 30 million @entity35			0
the @entity74 argues the move is good for society and good for the economy			2
opponents claim it would overly burden states and small businesses , raise costs , and reduce individual choice			0
all sides agree the issue needs to be decided soon , with more provisions of the law set to come into effect in coming years			2
legal analysts say the health care cases are the biggest to be tackled by the high court in a decade , and will shine new political light on the role of courts to decide these kinds of huge social issues			1
" the questions raised here are explosive , a kind of perfect storm for the justices to address in an election year , " said @entity217 , a @entity64 lawyer and founder of @entity219			0
" it will be impossible to take your eyes away from the @entity0			2
health care reform , a top @entity231 priority since the @entity233 administration , was passed by the previous @entity85 in a series of virtually party - line votes			1
@entity3 signed the act into law in march 2010			0
the law is widely considered to be the signature legislative accomplishment of the president 's first two years in office			2
among other things , the measure was designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured @entity35 receive adequate and affordable health care through the government - imposed mandates and subsidies			1
the federal government stated in court briefs that 45 million @entity35 last year were without health insurance , roughly 15 % of the country 's population			2
critics have equated the measure to socialized medicine , fearing that a bloated government bureaucracy would result in higher taxes and diminished health care services			1
opponents derisively labeled the measure " @entity22			0
" @entity138 leaders , who captured the @entity261 in the midterm elections , have vowed to overturn or severely trim the law			0
the cases accepted monday are @entity265 v. @entity25 ( 11 - 398 ) ; @entity266 v. @entity267 ( 11 - 393 ) ; and @entity25 v. @entity265 ( 11 - 400 ) .			0
