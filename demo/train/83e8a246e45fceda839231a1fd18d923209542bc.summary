-- pre-order response to the @entity2 has been massive , outstripping expectations of analysts , who were bullish on @entity7 's latest smartphone to begin with , and apparently of @entity7 itself			1
@entity7 received more than 2 million pre-orders in the first 24 hours , double the number it got for last year 's record - setting @entity12 release , the company said			1
@entity7 's initial promise to ship pre-ordered phones in a week , the same day they become available at @entity17 and other retailers , was pushed back just an hour after pre-orders opened up at midnight thursday			1
now , it could take up to a month for the phones to ship			0
wednesday morning , @entity7 's online store said a pre-ordered @entity2 would be shipped in three to four weeks			1
@entity7 has n't released up - to - date pre-order numbers			1
but @entity24 analyst @entity23 estimates the company could announce as many as 10 million sales by monday morning			1
his " worst case " scenario is 6 million			0
analyst @entity29 of @entity30 made light of initial reviews from the tech press that suggested the phone was n't as new or different as @entity7 claims			2
" we find it interesting that many tech blogs and reviewers panned the @entity2 saying it ' lacked the wow factor ' similar to the @entity40 that was plagued by ' antenna-gate ' and the @entity12 which was a relatively ' minor ' and ' disappointing ' update with @entity42 as the key new feature , " he wrote			2
" the previous iphones went on to sell record number of units and we believe @entity2 will likely see a similar result			2
" @entity48 of @entity49 agrees , saying his initial prediction of 5.5 million sales over the weekend was probably way too low			0
@entity7 's stock , which crested at $ 700 per share this week , could spiral to a mind - boggling $ 1,100 by this time next year , he said			0
some folks were already seeking to cash in on the wave of popularity friday -- before they even got their hands on one of the phones			0
@entity61 : lining up for an @entity2 ? on @entity63 , an unlocked , @entity62 had been bid up to more than $ 1,200 on friday , presumably by folks in countries where the smartphone wo n't be released for weeks			2
others were selling at prices ranging from $ 650 to $ 1,000			0
the @entity2 will be available at @entity7 stores in the @entity70 , which will open at 8 a.m. friday			1
