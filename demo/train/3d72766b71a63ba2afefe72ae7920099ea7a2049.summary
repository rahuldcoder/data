-- the 2012 @entity1 was awarded monday to sir @entity2 and @entity3 for work that revolutionized the understanding of how cells and organisms develop			1
the @entity9 's announcement at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , is the first for what will be a series of prizes announced this week			1
the @entity17 will announce the most anticipated of the annual honors -- the @entity19 -- on friday in @entity20 , @entity21			0
@entity2 , 79 , of @entity22 , @entity23 , and @entity3 , 50 , of @entity24 , @entity25 , share the prize jointly for their discovery that " mature , specialised cells can be reprogrammed to become immature cells capable of developing into all tissues of the body , " according to the @entity9 , which consists of 50 professors at the @entity10			1
@entity2 discovered in 1962 that the cells are reversible in an experiment with an egg cell of a frog			1
@entity3 discovered more than 40 years later how mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become immature stem cells " that are able to develop into all types of cells in the body , " the assembly said in a statement			1
" these groundbreaking discoveries have completely changed our view of the development and cellular specialisation			0
we now understand that the mature cell does not have to be confined forever to its specialised state , " the @entity9 said			2
" textbooks have been rewritten and new research fields have been established			2
by reprogramming human cells , scientists have created new opportunities to study diseases and develop methods for diagnosis and therapy			1
separated by more than 40 years , the work of @entity2 and @entity3 led to a practical medical use for stem cell research that sidesteps the main argument by anti-abortion opponents			1
now embryonic - like stem cells can be created in the laboratory from adult cells of the same organism , rather than using aborted fetuses or embryos , explained @entity72 , a stem cell researcher at the @entity74 , part of the @entity76 in @entity77			1
@entity2 pioneered cloning through cell reproduction in a tadpole in 1962			2
in 2006 , @entity3 figured out how to reprogram mature cells so that they revert to their primitive state as " induced pluripotent stem cells , " or ips cells , capable of developing into any part of the body , @entity72 said			1
the @entity1 awarded monday is the first for reprogramming cells , which scientists consider a major breakthrough in medical treatment			1
for example , a person suffering from @entity92 can have personal ips cells created from their blood , @entity72 said			1
those cells , which can be stored forever , can then be used to make new dopaminergic neurons that can be implanted to replace the cells damaged by the disease , he said			2

@entity109 was added as a category in 1968 , and the first prize awarded for economic sciences was in 1969			0
the monetary award that accompanies the @entity1 was lowered by the foundation this year by 20 % from 10 million @entity12 kronor ( $ 1.5 million ) to 8 million kronor ( $ 1.2 million ) because of the turbulence that has hit financial markets			1
on tuesday , the committee will announce its award for achievement in physics			0
the next day , the winner of the @entity1 in chemistry will be announced			0

a date for the announcement of the literature prize has not been set			0
since 1901 , the committee has handed out the @entity1 101 times			0
the youngest recipient was @entity136 , who won in 1923 at the age of 32			0
the oldest medicine laureate was @entity139 , who was 87 years old when he was awarded the prize in 1966			0

one - half of the prize in medicine went last year to @entity149 , who died just days before the @entity17 's announcement			1

@entity149 , a @entity159 immunologist , died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 68			0
he used a kind of experimental dendritic cell - based immunotherapy he designed in his treatment , according to @entity166 , where he conducted his research			2
the @entity9 committee was unaware of his death			0
had it known , its own rules would have precluded him being selected as a winner			0
the other half of the prize went to @entity175 and @entity176 for discovering proteins that detect bacteria in the body and activate the immune system 's first line of defense , a process known as innate immunity			2
@entity0 's @entity185 contributed to this report .			0

the pair 's work revolutionized the understanding of how cells and organisms develop
it led to a practical medical use for stem cell research , without needing embryonic cells
the nobel prize was created by @entity12 industrialist @entity104 in 1895
