-- @entity1 will soon be using your web browsing to help decide which advertisements you see			1
a new @entity1 system will use your activity on other websites to send you what @entity1 thinks are ads about your current interests			1
advertisers will , in effect , be bidding to get their ads in front of you			2
here 's an example : say a @entity1 user visits a travel website and clicks on a page about a vacation package to @entity23			2
if an advertiser has bid on that kind of search , that user could then see ads for discounted trips to @entity23 the next time they visit @entity1			1
" by bidding on a specific impression rather than a larger group , advertisers are able to show people more relevant ads while also running more efficient and effective campaigns , " a @entity1 spokeswoman said in a written statement			1
the site announced the new system , called @entity41 , to marketers last week			2
it 's expected to begin rolling out in the next couple of weeks			0
real - time bidding is already widely used across the @entity46			0
in a blog post , @entity48 of @entity49 - based social marketing company @entity47 compared the feature to @entity53 's @entity52 , which pushes an advertiser 's ad in front of users when they search for a keyword that advertiser has chosen			1
" the underlying principle is that users want relevant ads , advertisers do n't want to waste money on misguided ads , and @entity53 wants both users and advertisers to be real happy so they 'll come back again and again , " he wrote			1
currently , @entity1 ads are targeted based on users ' profiles and the companies or other pages they " like			1
" @entity48 writes that model will still be available for advertisers , but the new one should be more specific			2
@entity1 noted that users will be able to opt out of @entity41 by going to the site 's @entity75 , by clicking on an " x " that appears on the ads themselves or by blocking cookies on their web browser			1
the company statement said @entity1 wo n't share any user data with the advertisers and that no advertising controls that users currently have will go away			1
how do you feel about @entity1 targeting ads ? @entity89 , @entity47 's chief operating officer , said the new system probably wo n't appear dramatically different to the typical @entity1 user			1
" it 's not going to be discernible to most consumers , " he said			0
" most people wo n't notice any difference or , to the degree they can discern a difference , it will be ' wow ... this is more relevant to me			0
'' " and while the " real time " nature of the new system will enhance relevance , it wo n't be perfect , according to @entity89			0
" it 's possible you might not be served an ad until after you took that trip to @entity23 , " he said , referring to the previous example			0
" but without this kind of targeting , you might be served an ad for a trip to @entity114 , which you were n't considering anyway			0
" as web giants like @entity1 and @entity53 get better at harvesting user activity , using web searches for advertising is becoming increasingly popular			1
according to research firm @entity120 , more than $ 5 billion in online advertising is expected to go to real - time bidding ads in the @entity122 in 2015			0
that 's 27 % of what 's predicted to be spent , up from less than 10 % last year			0
@entity1 , of course , is increasingly under pressure to demonstrate a sustainable advertising model since its stock went public last month			2
@entity89 predicts the site will continue to diversify how its ads work in the coming months			0
it 's sometimes a tricky prospect			0
it was just revealed that @entity1 settled a lawsuit last month by the state of @entity135 over its " @entity137 " feature			0
according to reports , @entity1 paid $ 10 million to charity after five users claimed the site broke @entity135 law when it used their posts in the feature without paying them .			2

@entity41 will use web browsing to target ads
browser cookies will let advertisers *hyper* - focus their offers
@entity1 says users may opt out of the ad model
" @entity157 " is already used by @entity53 , others
