@entity0 , @entity1 -- from the time it was first incorporated by a group of gay activists , @entity0 has styled itself as @entity7 's gayest city			1
throughout the ' 80s and ' 90s it was a magnet for young gay men and lesbians looking for a place where they could fit in and be accepted			1
it was a place of bohemian lifestyles and bold experimentation			0
it 's a town where the @entity7 flag and the gay pride rainbow flag fly side by side			1
" we founded this city on an ideal that people could come here to remake their lives , " says city council candidate @entity20			2
but it is a principal that @entity20 and others believe is slipping away			0
gentrification has become a major issue in tuesday 's city elections			1
challengers to three incumbent council members up for re-election say city policies have boosted development , but high rents are squeezing out the young and the innovative			1
@entity37 has lived in @entity0 for 23 years			1
she does n't like some of the changes that she has seen			0
" the city sold out to developers , " according to @entity37			2
" they have destroyed old buildings for the construction of million dollar cookie - cutter condos			0
" the gay bars and dance clubs still line @entity48			2
and the @entity49 still bristles with rock clubs			0
but is the city that was once a hipster haven morphing into suburban conformity ? most of the rough edges that once defined @entity0 have long since been smoothed over			1
the notorious gay bath houses and seedy massage parlors are long gone			2
so too are many of the funky counter-culture boutiques that lent the city a great deal of its charm			2

the gay community is still a force in @entity0 , but today that community has prospered , aged and settled down			1

" resident @entity75 agrees , " i think its still one of the most liberal and progressive communities around			0
" the 47 - year - old @entity75 moved his family to @entity0 just one year ago because , " the city takes good care of its residents , and if it 's a little more conservative i do n't think that 's a bad thing			1
" but @entity85 , another city council candidate , believes the city is rapidly losing something special			0
" this community has made a promise to the gay and lesbian community of @entity7 that this is your home			2
" and @entity85 says that promise is not being kept because " access is simply not there for young people to move in and revitalize the community			2
" others believe that the creative core of the gay community has already moved east , to neighborhoods in @entity100 , @entity0 and @entity101			1
" i 've seen it before , " says @entity102			0
" it happened in the @entity105 and @entity106 in @entity107 when those neighborhoods began to become gentrified			0
" is @entity0 losing its mojo ? mayor @entity72 says the city is simply aging gracefully			1
