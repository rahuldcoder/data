@entity0 -- a @entity3 official said his country 's forces might have thought the @entity7 jet it downed last week was from @entity8			1
" as you know there is a country called @entity8 there and as you know this @entity17 country 's planes are very similar and because they both are from the same factory , from the @entity19 , maybe @entity3 thought it was an @entity8 plane , " @entity3 information minister @entity9 told the @entity7 @entity11 channel on wednesday			1

" i underline that @entity3 did not launch an attack and i wish that the @entity7 - @entity3 relations are at a better point			1
the current issue is that the @entity7 plane entered @entity3 space and it was responded as an unknown target			1
it was not downed because it was @entity7 's plane , " @entity9 said			1
" we never want to do any harm to the @entity7 people and @entity7			2
" both countries are searching for the jet 's pilots			2

@entity3 raised the stakes monday in the war of words over the incident			2
@entity3 @entity119 spokesman @entity118 said the plane was shot down in @entity3 airspace , disputing @entity7 's claim that it was downed over international waters after briefly straying into @entity3 airspace by mistake			1
" what happened was a violation of @entity3 airspace			0
even @entity7 says @entity3 sovereignty was violated			1
