the family of the first victim to die in the 2001 anthrax attacks will get $ 2.5 million from the @entity4 government under a settlement reached last week , according to court documents			1
@entity7 , 63 , worked as a photo editor for @entity9 and was the first of five victims of the attacks			1
he died october 5 , 2001 , after inhaling anthrax that investigators believe was in a letter sent to @entity9 , the publisher of the @entity17 and @entity18 tabloids , at its offices in @entity20 , @entity21			1
the @entity22 eventually blamed the attacks on a civilian scientist at the @entity26 's biological research laboratory at @entity27 , @entity28			1
the suspect , microbiologist @entity30 , had a history of mental illness and killed himself in 2008 before investigators brought charges against him , federal prosecutors said			0
@entity7 ' family sued the government for $ 50 million in 2003 , arguing that the military laboratory in @entity28 that was identified as the source of the bacterium should have had tighter security			1
a settlement notice dated november 23 was filed in @entity42 for the @entity43			0
a separate stipulation of settlement document filed with the court said the government admitted no blame in the case			2
it also said attorneys fees owed by the @entity7 family would come out of the settlement money , at no more than 25 % of the total			1
on october 31 , the lawyer for @entity7 ' family said a settlement had been reached but that final details had to be worked out with the @entity57			1
" i think the family was vindicated that the government has agreed to settle the case with them in spite of the fact that they put up a lot of roadblocks , " the lawyer , @entity58 , said in october			2
@entity7 and his wife , @entity68 , were married 27 years , and there is " still a hole in her life as far as her husband is concerned , " @entity58 said then			2
" it 's a horrible , painful death , that they had to witness their loved one go through , " @entity58 said			0
" it 's something that they 'll never forget			0
" a february report by the @entity81 concluded that it could not reach a " definitive conclusion " about the source of the anthrax , which federal agents said had been linked to a sample from @entity30 ' laboratory			0
but the @entity22 and the @entity57 stand by their findings , saying that scientific testing gave agents " valuable investigative leads " that led them to @entity30			2
a @entity93 investigation in early october revealed that the federal government has spent $ 19 billion to fight biological attacks			1
multiple new labs have since opened to research potential treatments , and the government now counts nearly 15,000 workers handling germs such as @entity101 , plague , and anthrax -- about twice as many as before			0
the @entity22 now checks potential workers for felonies and ties to terror groups			0
but proposed reforms like psychological screening or requiring two people in labs have gone nowhere , with scientists who have reviewed the issue calling those proposals intrusive , expensive and impractical .			0

the settlement will *pay* the victim 's family $ 2.5 million
the family of @entity7 had sued the government for $ 50 million
@entity7 , a tabloid photo editor , was the first *person* to die in the anthrax attacks in 2001
