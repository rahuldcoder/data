-- a 22 - year - old man from @entity2 hopes to soon swim the @entity3 with an @entity5 friend -- but first he 's got to navigate the currents of bureaucracy			1
college teammates @entity8 ( left ) and @entity9 want to swim the @entity3 for charity			1
@entity9 , an @entity11 college student who has won national swimming titles in his native @entity2 , wants to swim the channel with his best friend , @entity8 , a fellow member of the swim team at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity11			1
they want to honor their international friendship by working together to accomplish a great feat : a relay across the @entity3			1
they also hope to raise money for charity			2
" with teamwork and cooperation you can tackle even the toughest of challenges , " @entity9 told @entity0 in a phone interview wednesday from @entity26 , @entity2			1
yet the @entity33 government has denied @entity9 's request for the visa that would let him enter the country			1
@entity33 authorities say they ca n't grant a visa because they have questions about @entity9 's student status , the young man said			1
" they were n't satisfied i was going to @entity33 for the stated purpose , " he said			1
@entity9 said his passport contains a valid student visa for the @entity5 and he sent documentation from the @entity47 with his visa application to prove he is scheduled to do the swim			1
the @entity50 told @entity0 in a written statement that " all visa applications are considered on their individual merits , taking into account all the information provided			2
" " where an applicant fails to demonstrate they meet the relevant rules , their application will be refused , " the statement said			0
the agency noted that anyone who is refused can reapply with additional information			0
@entity64 , the director of marketing and communication at @entity16 , said @entity33 authorities have not contacted the university to ask about @entity9 's student status			1
" we did send ... documentation to [ @entity33 authorities ] to follow up " after @entity72 's application was denied , he said			1
@entity9 has since applied to the @entity33 high commissioner in @entity26 for an emergency visa			1
meanwhile , @entity8 and the university 's head swim coach , @entity75 , are waiting in @entity77 , @entity78 , hoping things will work out so the men can try to accomplish their goal			2
the @entity47 has granted them permission to try their crossing between july 29 and august 6 , @entity9 said			1
the association determines such " swim windows " after considering the expected tides and the schedules of pilot boats , which accompany the swimmers			2
the association sent a letter thursday to the @entity33 high commissioner in @entity2 to confirm @entity72 's mission , said @entity95 , the association 's chairwoman			1
as the clock ticks , @entity8 remains in @entity77 , where he passes the time by training in the channel			0
" there is some frustration , " he said thursday , " but we 're also optimistic			0
" @entity8 is the captain of @entity16 's varsity swim team			2
he swam twice for the university at the @entity106 national championship meet and holds numerous records			0
@entity9 is a gold medalist on the @entity2 national swim team and represented his country at the @entity111			1
their coach said he 's proud of the pair , no matter the outcome of their attempt			0
" i think it 's great			0
it shows so much maturity on their part -- first , to take on such a large endeavor , but it also speaks so much about their friendship , " @entity75 said			0
their relationship reflects the unity of the entire swim team at the school , he said			0
" this is an international family , " the coach said of his swimmers			0
" it 's a phenomenal environment			0
this has just been such a great experience			0
" as they work to accomplish their goal , @entity8 and @entity9 also are accepting donations for @entity140 , an international medical humanitarian organization also known by its @entity142 name , @entity140			1
@entity8 , who is double - majoring in biochemistry and pre-med , said the idea came as they followed news reports of @entity2 's campaign against the @entity150 this year , which displaced thousands of civilians in the country 's northwest			2
" we wanted to donate to an organization that was helping people there , " he explained			0
@entity9 added thursday , " that was a big reason we chose @entity140 , because there are a lot of people suffering in that area and they are assisting them			2
" some of the donations will cover costs associated with their anticipated channel swim , he added			0
but even if they do n't get to do their relay , @entity9 said , their effort is still worthwhile			2
" even if my visa does n't go through , we 'll continue with @entity174 , " he vowed , referring to the organization they set up for their effort			0
" even if i have to swim in a lake in @entity2 while @entity8 swims in the @entity3 , it 's still a powerful symbol , " @entity9 said			1
" symbols gather power not from the act itself but from the people who are supporting them , " he said			0
" a lot of people around the world are supporting us and our message			0
as long as they support it in their hearts and minds , we have been successful			0
