@entity0 -- the heart of president @entity4 's speech tuesday was the same focus on jobs and middle - class economic uncertainty that 's driven every @entity8 of his presidency			1
but that was far from the only ground he covered			0
the president reeled off a laundry list of small - bore proposals : he called on @entity17 to hike the minimum wage to $ 9 an hour and invest $ 50 billion on rebuilding roads and bridges			1
he proposed universal preschool for 4 - year - olds and linking some federal grant decisions to research schools on their ability to keep tuition costs in check			0
and he urged @entity17 to put his full gun control agenda up for a vote			2
5 things we learned from the @entity8 nearly every idea in his speech had a couple of things in common : virtually all of them are core @entity41 priorities presented in language that delighted the base			1
none of them were shoot - for - the moon ambitious			0
they were either old ideas repackaged or markedly modest new ones			0
and few if any of them are likely to become a reality under the current @entity17			2
@entity8 : more same old , same old in a sharp contrast to his first address to @entity17 four years ago , the president paid lip service to bipartisanship , but he made clear that it was a luxury , not a driving priority			1
he invited republicans to join him in a bipartisan effort ... to back the @entity41 policy vision			1
if the speech came across more like a wish list than an action plan with a good chance of making it past the @entity68 , that 's because it was			2
just laying the exhaustive string of liberal policy priorities seemed to be the point -- a companion to the ideological offensive in his inauguration speech			1
the top priority tuesday was n't necessarily jobs , or guns , or climate change , or voting rights			0
it was the sum of all those parts , a liberal vision that @entity4 clearly hopes will nudge the country in that direction			2
what @entity4 said " it is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities , you can get ahead , " the president said			1
" it is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many , and not just the few			0
" the framing in tuesday 's speech was designed to help the president score two wins : in the long term , a progressive legacy , and in the short run , an advantage in the budget battles and debt ceiling drama			1
with the @entity59 laying responsibility for a looming sequester at the @entity68 door , the president pointed to @entity59 ' emphasis on the need for entitlement reform as proof that they 're laying the burden for deficit reduction on cops and teachers and seniors instead of " the wealthiest and most powerful			2
" " deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan , " he said			0
" a growing economy that creates good , middle - class jobs -- that must be the @entity127 that guides our efforts			0
" @entity4 dares @entity17 to get the job done it 's a message designed to resonate with working - class voters , and the @entity59 's standard - bearer for the evening , sen. @entity133 , countered with a mirror - image appeal to the same demographic			1
" mr. president , i still live in the same working - class neighborhood i grew up in			0
my neighbors are n't millionaires			0
they 're retirees who depend on @entity140 and @entity141 , " @entity133 said			2
" i do n't oppose your plans because i want to protect the rich			0
i oppose your plans because i want to protect my neighbors			0
" @entity133 says @entity4 would hurt the middle class the approach was much the same as the president 's , an ideological vision unweighted by grand , ambitious plans to make it a reality			1
in fact , for an exhaustive speech , @entity4 's @entity8 was notably short on some key specifics			1
the @entity68 has so far brushed off calls for a price tag for the proposals in tuesday 's speech , promising a full accounting when the president sends his next budget to @entity17			1
but in the end , the policy details may be less important than the political timing			0
the @entity68 and congressional republicans remain locked in a brutal message war over the sequester , now just over two weeks away			0
