-- @entity4 smugglers trying to find new routes into the @entity2 are turning increasingly to the @entity6 for a short sail to the @entity9 coast , where they drop off illegal immigrants and marijuana , @entity2 officials say			1
the @entity6 around the @entity9 coastline is being used more often by @entity4 smugglers			1
the water route has become particularly popular in the past year			1
" we 've seen a huge spike in smuggling by water , " said @entity14 , a spokeswoman for the @entity16 office in @entity17 , @entity9			1
" it 's become very , very risky and difficult to cross by land			1
smugglers try to jump where they think we 're not looking			1
" @entity2 @entity27 capt. @entity26 , the top - ranking @entity26 official at the @entity28 , said interdictions of human cargo on the @entity6 have doubled since last year			1
drug busts -- all marijuana -- are even higher , he said			2
" drug interdictions are six times above what they were last year , " @entity26 told @entity0 wednesday			1
so far this year , he said , authorities have confiscated 60,000 pounds of marijuana and caught 400 people trying to sneak into the @entity2			1
the water route has become popular , he said , because " the land border has been so severely closed by customs and border agents			1
" that land route was particularly difficult tuesday for smugglers who tried to speed three vans full of illegal immigrants through the @entity49 border crossing between @entity50 , @entity4 , and @entity17 , @entity9			1
@entity49 is the busiest land border crossing in the world , with up to 45,000 cars and 95,000 people passing through each day			1
one @entity16 ( @entity16 ) and two @entity57 agents opened fire , wounding two suspects , officials said			2
another two people were injured when one of the vans crashed into another vehicle			2
more than 70 people aboard the three vans were captured as were two of the drivers , authorities said			1
one driver ran back into @entity4 and got away , officials said			2
the @entity71 is investigating the shootings because they occurred within the city limits , said police lt. @entity74			0
tuesday 's incident was the second shooting in less than a week in @entity17 involving federal authorities			1
two @entity81 agents are under investigation after shooting at a smuggling suspect they believed was trying to run one of them over with a vehicle , @entity79 said			0
that suspect also was wounded			0
why anyone would try to run a heavily secured checkpoint in tuesday 's incident may be beyond comprehension to some people			1
" there 's a sense of desperation that exists these days trying to get folks across the border , " he said			2
@entity16 spokeswoman @entity98 said she was taken aback , particularly since @entity49 has " a major obstacle course , " with speed bumps , concrete barricades , a gate and tire shredders			0
" what was surprising , " she said , " was the brazen attempt in a very public area in the middle of the day , to assume that they could run the port of entry in today 's world			2
" that 's not too smart , " she added			2
" what do they call that ? felony stupid ? " @entity98 and @entity118 , a spokeswoman for the @entity57 office in @entity17 , have noticed another phenomena : young people taping drugs to their bodies and trying to walk across the border			0
many of them are high school students , @entity98 said			0
they can make $ 200 to $ 300 for each trip , said @entity130			0
but it 's the @entity6 route that has become more common -- and increasingly dangerous , officials say			1
smugglers often use small fishing boats known as pangas , @entity98 said			1
usually 19 to 28 feet in length , smugglers will load them up with illegal immigrants to the point the vessels become dangerous			1
" we 've seen them pretty packed , " @entity98 said			0
" they cram them in there just like they cram them in the vans			0
" there 's another danger , she said			2
" we 've noticed that violent tactics have increased , particularly in the water , " @entity98 said			1
" we 've seen an increase in the type of violent tactics these smuggling groups are using			2
that 's a clear sign of desperation			2
" tuesday 's incident at @entity49 left thousands of cars stopped on the road for hours when @entity2 authorities closed all 24 northbound lanes into the country			1
the five southbound lanes into @entity4 remained open			0
witnesses described a chaotic scene with officers yelling at the vans as they sped away and then drawing their weapons and firing			0
" i was crossing the bridge , and i started hearing all this gunfire , " @entity170 told @entity0 affiliate @entity171			0
" i saw a couple officers shooting at the van , and i saw a couple of lights fly out			0
a couple tried to run out ( of a van ) and they got swarmed by all the @entity57 agents			0
" another motorist might have been too close for comfort			0
" this officer was yelling at this blue van that was heading north , " the unidentified witness told @entity0 affiliate @entity171			0
" he had his gun in his hand , obviously			0
he yelled at them and they did n't stop			0
i heard two or three gunshots and at that point in time , i went to the floor			0
" border officials opened up eight lanes a couple of hours after the incident , @entity130 said			0
but it took a few more hours for all lanes to be opened			0
@entity0 's @entity198 contributed to this report .			2
