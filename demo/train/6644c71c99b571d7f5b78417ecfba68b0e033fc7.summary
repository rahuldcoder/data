-- @entity1 lashed out friday against the latest round of sanctions over its involvement in @entity5 , accusing the @entity6 of once again escalating the crisis -- undermining the chances for peace there as well as the greater quest for " global stability			1
" this followed @entity6 president @entity15 's announcement thursday that , in coordination with the @entity21 , " we will intensify our coordinated sanctions on @entity1 in response to its illegal actions in @entity5			1
" the @entity6 and its allies , chief among them @entity5 's @entity26 - based government , accuse @entity1 of implicitly and explicitly supporting separatists claiming territory and battling the @entity5 military in the @entity32 nation 's east and south			1
@entity34 has voiced moral support for the rebels but denied any direct involvement , including countering @entity38 and others ' claims that its forces have entered @entity5 and fired on @entity5 's military			2
@entity1 's foreign ministry issued a statement friday responding to the latest sanctions , which it called " the latest hostile step on the confrontational course of the @entity6 administration			1
" the ministry claimed @entity54 " is focusing on an escalation of the @entity5 conflict " rather than a peaceful resolution			0
levying sanctions against @entity34 is counterproductive , the @entity1 government added , claiming they hurt @entity6 businesses and compromise international goodwill to address common issues like terrorism and drug trafficking			2
and sanctions wo n't spur @entity1 to change its policy , according to the foreign ministry			1
" we are not going to act in order to please the @entity6 ' geopolitical ambitions and the calculations of those overseas politicians who are trying to use a ' manageable @entity5 ' to restrain @entity1 , " the ministry said			1
the foreign ministry did n't respond back with counter-sanctions against @entity54 , which it characterized as " a last - ditch measure			2
" instead , it said it is " leaving the door open to constructive and honest bilateral cooperation , including working together to tackle the @entity5 crisis if the @entity6 administration is willing			0
" " @entity54 needs to recognize : only respect for each other 's interest can help us find a solution to the @entity5 crisis that suits everyone , " the @entity1 ministry said			1
new sanctions despite ceasefire for months , @entity1 and the @entity86 have been at odds over @entity5 -- which continues to simmer with tension , despite a fragile , recently agreed - upon ceasefire			0
@entity6 officials and their allies have not dispatched troops into @entity5 to help their allies there ; in fact , @entity15 has ruled out such direct intervention			0
instead , they have tried to press the issue diplomatically and through sanctions targeting @entity1 citizens , officials and industries			0
their rationale is to compel the @entity101 to stop fueling , in their view , the crisis in @entity5			0
that 's even after @entity1 president @entity105 played a role in brokering a ceasefire signed friday after talks in @entity109 , @entity110 , between representatives of @entity5 , the rebels and @entity1			2
speaking about the new sanctions , @entity15 said thursday , " we are implementing these new measures in light of @entity1 's actions to further destabilize @entity5 over the last month , including through the presence of heavily armed @entity1 forces in eastern @entity5			1
" we are watching closely developments since the announcement of the ceasefire and agreement in @entity109 , but we have yet to see conclusive evidence that @entity1 has ceased its efforts to destabilize @entity5			0
" a @entity38 military officer said thursday that @entity1 has about 1,000 troops inside eastern @entity5 , down from a significantly higher number in recent weeks			2
@entity38 also sees 20,000 more @entity1 troops aligned along the border , according to the @entity38 office , who was not named according to standard practice in the organization			0
