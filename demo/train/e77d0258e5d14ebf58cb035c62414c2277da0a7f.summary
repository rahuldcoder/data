@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 said saturday it has launched an investigation into claims of a new betting scandal involving the @entity8 national team			1
the allegations , which emerged saturday in the @entity11 tabloid @entity10 , relate to the third one - day international between @entity1 and @entity8 , held in @entity0 on friday			0
" a source informed @entity10 newspaper that a certain scoring pattern would emerge during certain stages of the match and , broadly speaking , that information appeared to be correct , " @entity3 chief executive @entity13 said in a statement			1
" we therefore feel it is incumbent upon us to launch a full enquiry into this particular game , although it is worth pointing out at this stage that we are not stating as fact that anything untoward has occurred , " @entity13 said			0
" only in the fullness of the investigation can that be established			0
" the @entity10 reported " illegal bookies in @entity32 and @entity33 apparently knew in advance what would happen " during the game so they could make bets			1
the paper said its undercover team was able to pass details to @entity3 inspectors before the match began at the @entity44 cricket ground in south @entity0			1
" cricket chiefs then watched as @entity8 's score mirrored the target that bookies had been told in advance by a fixer , " @entity10 reported			1
it is not thought the overall result was fixed -- only scoring rates in parts of @entity8 's innings , the paper said			1
it said the investigation centers on a person " within the team camp " who is believed to be the ringleader , taking money from bookies and ensuring their orders are carried out			2
@entity8 won the game by 23 runs			0
the claims follow a separate alleged scam , also involving the @entity8 team during its ongoing tour of @entity1			2
the tabloid @entity69 reported that @entity8 players deliberately bowled " no balls , " or fouls , at specific points in a game with @entity1 in late august , and that the alleged ringleader of the scam made 150,000 pounds ( about $ 230,000 )			2
@entity0 's @entity76 have questioned four players over the allegations			0
they passed their evidence in that case friday to prosecutors , who will decide whether to press charges			0
the @entity3 provisionally suspended three of the players questioned by police and charged them with various offenses under the council 's anti-corruption code .			0
