-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 says he had some " pretty good fights " with sen. @entity4			1
but @entity4 's death early monday puts the @entity7 governor in a pretty good bind in replacing him			2
@entity4 dies ; was @entity11 's last @entity10 vet " it 's no mystery that sen. @entity4 and i did n't always agree , " @entity1 said monday of the @entity12			1
" in fact , it probably is more honest to say we very often did n't agree , and we had some pretty good fights between us over time -- battles on philosophy and the role of government			0
" @entity4 : the last ' swamp dog ' as @entity1 , a @entity7 , runs for what is expected to be a relatively easy re-election , he now invites unwanted attention as he decides on a temporary replacement for @entity4			1
@entity31 hits @entity1 rival for tax record if he does n't name a conservative , that could complicate his already strained relationship with conservatives from across the country , which could spell trouble if @entity1 decides to run for the 2016 @entity7 presidential nomination			1
two conflicting @entity2 state laws about when to hold a special election to fill a vacant @entity11 seat add complexity			1
one statute says that " if a vacancy shall happen in the representation of this @entity50 in the @entity11 , it shall be filled at the general election next succeeding the happening thereof , unless such vacancy shall happen within 70 days next preceding such election			0
" the next general election in the @entity2 is in november , when @entity1 is up for re-election			1
since @entity4 's death is not within 70 days of that election , a special election to fill the final year of @entity4 's term could be held this november			1
but another state statute says that if the vacancy happens within 70 days of the primary that precedes the next general election , the special election will be held at the second succeeding election			1
the primary for this november 's contests is tuesday			0
since @entity4 's death is well within that window , under this provision an election would not be held until november 2014 , with the winner serving a full six - year term			1
both statutes agree that the governor is authorized to set the date for such an election			0
there are some obvious political advantages for @entity1 to put the election off until 2014			2
polls show that @entity1 has a 2 - 1 advantage right now over @entity82 state sen. @entity81			2
but a @entity7 strategist from @entity2 tells @entity0 that a special @entity11 election this november could increase @entity82 turnout , especially if @entity87 mayor @entity86 is on the ballot			2
@entity86 is considering his own run for @entity11 in 2014			0
even with a very large lead over @entity81 , why would a @entity7 governor running for re-election in a blue state want to invite higher @entity82 turnout this year ? if @entity1 decides to hold the @entity11 contest in 2014 with a hand - picked replacement serving 18 months by @entity98 , it could invite legal action from @entity2 democrats			1
state party chairman @entity100 tells @entity0 that " it 's a slap in the face to @entity2 voters not to have a say in who represents them for a year and a half			0
" @entity100 says @entity2 democrats expect the election to be this november , pointing to what he says is the most recent statute by state lawmakers on the timing of such a vote			1
sources close to the governor say @entity1 has made no decisions because it 's so early in the process			0
but they expect him to announce a 2014 @entity11 election rather than a special contest this year			2
while there 's controversy over the timing of an election , an even bigger question is who would @entity1 name to immediately fill the seat ? and what impact would that pick have on his 2013 re-election run and any possible 2016 bid ? one top name to emerge is state sen. @entity137 , a longtime @entity1 ally who last november lost to the state 's other @entity139 senator , democrat @entity138 , by 20 percentage points			1
other possibilities include lt. gov. @entity143 ; state assemblyman @entity144 , who appears to be gearing up to run for the @entity11 in 2014 ; and state lawmaker @entity145 , son of former @entity7 gov. @entity146 , a political mentor of @entity1			0
some pundits have suggested that @entity1 could even appoint the former governor , now 78 , as a caretaker until a special election			1
there were also rumors @entity1 would consider @entity86 , since the @entity12 took a pass on challenging him for governor this year			2
but both sides shot down such a farfetched scenario			0
@entity1 is touting his ability to work with @entity82 , and he 's won the endorsement of a number of @entity82 politicians			0
choosing a moderate @entity7 would not rock the boat , but choosing a more conservative or partisan @entity7 could cause problems			0
such a pick , however , would help @entity1 mend fences with national conservatives , still upset with his praise of president @entity169 personally and of the federal response in the wake of @entity172			1
@entity169 channels @entity174 in touring @entity2 storm recovery while @entity1 's approval rating in @entity2 soared after @entity172 and has remained high , some commentators in his own party blasted him for his praise of @entity169 , saying it contributed to the defeat of @entity7 nominee @entity183			1
@entity1 's criticism in january of @entity186 @entity7 ' slow -- but eventual -- approval of federal recovery aid to @entity172 victims and the governor 's teaming up with @entity169 again last week to promote recovery efforts along the @entity191 have n't helped			2
@entity192 , a @entity7 activist in @entity193 , the first @entity194 state to vote in the presidential primary and caucus calendar , expressed a critical conservative sentiment			0
" @entity1 burned a lot of bridges with conservatives and tea partiers before the last election cavorting with @entity169 in the @entity172 aftermath			1
even though most people do n't think it really affected the election , it just made @entity1 look more wishy - washy , " he said			0
" if @entity1 appoints a " @entity211 moderate placeholder , red state @entity139 will be irrevocably opposed to him throughout the 2016 primary process , " added @entity192 , the former head of the @entity209 , @entity193 , @entity7			0
similar feelings were found in @entity216 , which kicks off the overall caucus and primary calendar			0
" i do think that gov. @entity1 's selection will have a major impact on his 2016 presidential aspirations , " said @entity219 , a @entity7 strategist and founder and editor - in - chief of the @entity216 @entity7			1
" many conservatives have grown frustrated with @entity1 since last november and this provides him an opportunity to heal some of those wounds by appointing someone who has broad appeal with @entity7			2
if @entity1 would happen to nominate a @entity12 , any presidential aspirations would immediately go up in smoke , " he said			0
@entity1 's quandary was so appetizing , it even invited a comment from @entity237 , the senior adviser behind @entity169 's 2008 and 2012 victories			2
" fascinating dilemma for @entity1			0
does he name interim who reflects his more moderate state , or feed @entity244 for ' 16 ? " tweeted @entity237 .			0

law allows @entity2 governor to temporarily fill seat held by late sen. @entity4
question is timing for a special election this year or a vote in november 2014
@entity1 up for re-election this year , considered possible 2016 presidential contender
@entity1 *angered* conservatives with praise for @entity169 following 2012 *hurricane*
