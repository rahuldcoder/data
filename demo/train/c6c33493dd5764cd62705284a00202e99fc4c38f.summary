@entity0 -- a @entity3 prosecutor has openly accused police of interfering with a high - level corruption investigation			1
" court orders have not been carried out and there has been open pressure on the judicial process from both the chief prosecutor 's office and from the police force , which is supposed to carry out the decisions of the courts , " @entity6 said in a thursday statement			1
he spoke one day after three cabinet ministers resigned their posts , after their sons were arrested or temporarily detained in an anti-graft sting , semiofficial news agency @entity16 reported			1
one of them , @entity22 and environment minister @entity23 , went further than the other two , not just resigning his @entity25 position but also calling on prime minister @entity26 to step down			0
@entity3 media reported a possible second wave of detentions as imminent late wednesday , but the raids did not materialize			1
instead , an apparent deadlock within the judiciary emerged as @entity6 , the prosecutor , issued his statement saying the judiciary was under the heel of the government			2
@entity6 accused police and prosecutors of ignoring a decision of the courts by refusing to carry out more raids			0
in a televised statement , chief @entity0 prosecutor @entity42 fired back , saying that @entity45 had mishandled the investigation and leaked information to the press , leading to his removal from the case			1

@entity26 accepted the resignations , @entity16 reported			0
the sons were detained in a roundup that included the head of a public bank , several bureaucrats and high - profile businessmen			1

many analysts see the corruption investigation as a public fight between @entity26 and @entity72 , an @entity73 preacher living in self imposed exile in @entity76			1
@entity26 has repeatedly said since the corruption arrests began that international organizations with branches inside @entity3 are trying to destabilize the country			1

we will not allow the interest lobby , the war lobby , the blood lobby to carry out an operation under the guise of a corruption operation , " he said sunday			0
@entity3 is expected to hold local elections next year , and some analysts see the raids as a test of @entity26 's grip on power , especially after a turbulent year of unprecedented anti-government protests			2
demonstrations continued thursday , with marches in @entity0 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , where police used water cannons on marchers			1
protesters chanted : " the ministers are thieves , " " everywhere is bribery , everywhere is corruption , " the " @entity107 will clean this dirt " and the " prime minister is a thief			1

after the announcement , former culture minister @entity119 tweeted his displeasure			0
" i wish success to the new members of the @entity25			0
i will suffice to say for now that i do n't find the choices for @entity126 and @entity127 positions suitable , " he wrote wednesday			0
