@entity0 -- after years of planning and months of campaigning , the most expensive presidential race in history comes down to a final five - day whirlwind of speeches and television ads in the eight states still up for grabs			1
president @entity11 and @entity13 challenger @entity12 plan to hold virtually nonstop events between now and the tuesday election considered too close to call			1
the focus is on battleground states worth 95 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win			1
both sides are trying to close the deal with a dwindling number of uncommitted voters , while making sure supporters actually cast ballots			0
that means a game of campaign chess that started thursday , with appearances by the candidates and their surrogates as well as advertising dollars allocated to the places considered most vital to success			0
concluding a race expected to cost more than $ 6 billion overall , @entity11 and @entity12 and their running mates will hit all the battleground states -- @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity38 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
the campaigns also are unloading a blast of television ads and mailings that threaten to overwhelm voters already saturated with politicking			0
@entity11 , @entity12 paths to victory cross in @entity41 perhaps no one said it better than 4 - year - old @entity56 of @entity57 , @entity39 , who -- according to @entity58 -- cried after listening to more election coverage on the radio and told her mother : " i 'm tired of @entity62 and @entity12			1
" in a sign of the strategic maneuvering at hand , @entity12 surrogates and @entity67 supporting him are targeting two states considered likely to go for @entity11 -- @entity69 and @entity70			1
on thursday , @entity12 ' s campaign announced he will visit @entity70 on sunday , a major commitment that signaled it believes he can win the @entity70			1
his running mate , rep. @entity74 , will campaign in @entity70 on saturday			1
according to @entity12 's team , both @entity70 and @entity69 are in play due to what it calls a surge of momentum that emerged after the first presidential debate on october 3 , which analysts and polls scored a solid victory for the former @entity86 governor over a lackluster @entity11			1
in response , the president 's campaign pointed to his lead in polls in both states and argued the money and time spent in them by the @entity12 campaign amounts to a bluff to try to depict nonexistent momentum			1
@entity13 candidates claiming late momentum made a final push in @entity70 in the last five elections , and lost the state every time , according to the @entity11 team			1
at the same time , @entity11 's camp and supporting groups have devoted some new attention to both @entity70 and @entity69 , which are crucial to the president 's strategy for nailing down the electoral advantage			1
in an example of the advertising battle , a @entity12 campaign ad broadcast this week in @entity40 seeks to link @entity11 to @entity114 's @entity113 and @entity116 's @entity115 -- leftist leaders reviled by much of the state 's @entity120 @entity119 population			1
the ad spotlights endorsements from @entity113 and @entity124 , the niece of @entity115 , who both said they would vote for @entity11 if they could			2
while @entity127 overwhelmingly support @entity11 , according to polls , @entity12 and @entity13 hold an advantage among more conservative @entity120			1
another @entity12 ad released thursday attacked @entity11 's suggestion in an interview with @entity133 that he would consider consolidating government agencies under a new " secretary of business " in a second term			1
the ad portrayed the comment as more big government , saying @entity11 's " solution to everything is to add another bureaucrat			0
" @entity12 echoed the ad in his first stop thursday in @entity44 , ending a temporary cease - fire in direct political attacks this week due to @entity147 by saying , " we do n't need a secretary of business to understand business , we need a president who understands business and i do , and that 's why i 'll be able to get this economy going			2
" in @entity119 : parallels to country 's racist past haunt age of @entity11 the @entity11 campaign , meanwhile , released new television and radio ads that featured the endorsement for the president by former secretary of state @entity163 , a @entity13			1
the ads to run in the battleground states , as well as @entity166 , include @entity163 supporting achievements of @entity11 's first term			1
another @entity11 ad took aim at an earlier @entity12 spot that implied @entity172 was shifting jeep manufacturing from the @entity119 to @entity174 , a claim denied by the automaker			1
the @entity11 campaign said the ad will run in @entity69 and @entity38 , two big auto industry states			2
both candidates sought to balance their campaign stump speeches between longstanding criticism of each other with positive messaging meant to inspire voters to choose them			0
the challenge is to pick up any remaining undecided voters while motivating all bona fide supporters to either cast votes early or head to the polls on tuesday			0
for @entity11 , that means overcoming disappointment with continuing high unemployment and sluggish economic recovery during his presidency			0
" these are the last five days of his last campaign -- ever , " noted @entity11 campaign spokeswoman @entity196			2
" so you will hear many of the themes , much about the fight that he 's been waging throughout his ... career in public life on behalf of the middle class			0
" at his first stop thursday in @entity208 , @entity45 , the president told a cheering crowd on the airport tarmac that @entity12 is trying to sell failed @entity13 policies that helped cause the financial collapse of 2008 as forward progress			2
" he is saying he is the candidate of change , " @entity11 said			0
" well , let me tell you @entity45 -- we know what change looks like and what the governor is offering sure ai n't change			0
" pointing to his own record of health care reform , @entity221 reform and other steps he said were intended to strengthen the middle class , the president told his supporters they know real change when they see it			0
@entity12 and @entity13 were counting on the @entity119 people to be " so worn down by all the squabbling , so tired of all the dysfunction that you will actually reward obstruction and put people back in charge who advocate the very policies that got us into this mess , " @entity11 said			2
" in other words , their bet is on cynicism , " he added			0
" but @entity45 my bet is on you			0
my bet is on the decency and good sense of the @entity119 people because despite all the resistance , despite all the setbacks , we have won some great fights			0
" @entity251 , a @entity252 strategist and @entity1 contributor , said she expected similar attacks on @entity12 in the final days of the race			1
poll shows @entity11 edge in @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity45 referring to the @entity13 challenger , @entity251 said " the dissonance between what he is saying now , what he has said in the past , and what his policies will actually do is something that voters are going to continue to hear about from the @entity11 campaign and their surrogates , as they should			2
" vice president @entity268 followed that script thursday , telling an @entity41 crowd that @entity11 " says what he means and he means what he says , and no one can say that about gov. @entity12			1
" earlier , @entity12 told cheering , sign - waving supporters in @entity276 , @entity44 , that @entity11 's policies have failed to bring the kind of economic growth the nation should be experiencing , asking if people wanted " four more years like the last four years " with high unemployment , trillion - dollar deficits and political gridlock in @entity0			2
" i know that the @entity11 folks are chanting four more years , four more years			0
but our chant is this -- five more days , " he said			0
he also accused the @entity11 campaign of " shrinking to smaller things " through personal attacks against him			2
his speech included now familiar references to offering a new direction for the country in what has been a more positive and personal touch for a candidate considered aloof and wooden during the @entity13 primaries			0
" it 's exactly what he needs to do these last few days of the campaign -- get his base enthused , get them out to work , " said @entity300 , a @entity13 strategist and @entity1 contributor			0
" it 's all about the ground game right now			0
" while @entity12 has been unable to overtake @entity11 so far in most swing state polls , some of the polling data suggests the president could be vulnerable			1
for example , an @entity317 / @entity316 / @entity315 poll released thursday showed voters under 30 in @entity42 -- an important demographic for the president -- were less enthusiastic about the election than older demographics that tend to be more supportive of @entity12			2
@entity11 needs to repeat his strong support in 2008 from young voters as well as minority voters -- especially @entity127 and african - americans -- to win on tuesday , and that means making sure the turnout on @entity329 is as large as possible			0
compounding the turnout issue are logistical problems along the @entity332 due to the devastation by @entity147 , and expected legal issues including tightened voter eligibility standards in some states that @entity252 complain were intended to suppress the minority vote			0
do the math : @entity339 @entity1 's @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 and @entity347 contributed to this report .			0
