-- there are many practices from biblical times that are best left in the past			2
stoning adulterers comes to mind			0
but let me tell you about one dusty @entity11 custom that deserves a comeback : tithing			1
for those who skipped sunday school , tithing is the practice of giving 10 percent of your annual income to the needy			1
you donate one out of every ten dollars ( or shekels or sheep ) to the orphans , the widows , the destitute , or the temple high priests			0
granted , some folks in 21st - century @entity29 still tithe ( devout @entity30 , for instance , are expected to cough up 10 percent )			1
but the practice has largely gone the way of pharaohs and women named @entity36			1
tithing is hard as hell , especially in these lean times			1
i first learned about tithing a few years ago			1
at the time , i was trying to follow every rule in the @entity43 -- a journey i chronicled in a book			0
the @entity43 told me to tithe			0
when i told my wife , @entity47 , about my plan to tithe , she fretted			1
in general , she 's much more magnanimous than i am			1
she 's a sucker for those charities that send you free sheets of return - address labels with little cartoons of a @entity55 , along with a heartbreaking brochure about lymphoma			1
i tell her it 's emotional blackmail			1
she ignores me and mails them checks			1
@entity0 : how to give smart but even for @entity47 percent is high , especially with the ridiculously expensive prospect of raising children in @entity65			1
@entity47 asked whether i could count my literary agent 's fee as a tithe			1
she was only half - joking			0
" can you at least do 10 percent after taxes ? " she said			1
that night i called a friend who 's a @entity72 pastor			1
" you should n't get too legalistic , " he said			0
" give what you can			0
and then give some more			0
it should feel like a sacrifice			0
" @entity78 challenge to you : day of @entity80 i studied my @entity43 for insight			1
it seems that in the time of ancient @entity85 -- before the @entity83 took over -- no one paid taxes per se			1
the tithes were the taxes			1
and the tithing system was as complicated as any 1040 form			1
the farmers gave to the priests , the temple - keepers , the temple itself , the poor , the widows , and the orphans			1
so i decided after - tax tithing was probably okay			1
i calculated 10 percent of my projected salary			1
it was n't a huge number -- but that was precisely the problem			0
if i were making $ 10 million a year and had to give away $ 1 million , that would have been easier			1
although many modern tithers give to their church , i decided to go directly to the needy			0
i spent hours browsing the web site @entity109			0
it 's sort of a @entity112 guide to aid organizations			2
( even this leads to coveting -- they list the salaries of these charity ceos , and some break half a million			0
) see more ways you can help at @entity122 's @entity121 i settled on several organizations focusing on children and widows , two groups the @entity43 says are always in need			2
one was called @entity128 , another @entity129			0
@entity0 : how to give when dollars are tight the giving was painful			0
i mean , 10 percent ? that would have an impact on our lives			1
vacations would need to be scaled back , new furniture would have to wait			0
it was a huge amount			0
when i pressed " send " on the donations , my palms got wet , my heart rate spiked			0
but it was a pain mixed with pleasure			2
when the confirmation e-mails pinged in , i felt good			2
there 's a haunting line from the movie " @entity148			2
" it 's spoken by @entity150 , who plays a deeply religious sprinter in the @entity152			2
he says : " when i run , i feel his pleasure			2
" and as i gave away money , i think i might have felt @entity157 's pleasure			1
i do n't know if there 's a @entity157 or not , but still i felt some higher sense of purpose			1
it was like a cozy ember that started at the back of my neck and slowly spread its warmth through my skull			0
i felt like i was doing something i should have done all my life			2
that feeling of pleasure when giving -- scientists actually call it the warm - glow effect -- is n't strong enough to get most @entity29 to cough up 10 percent , though			1
according to the @entity175 , the average @entity29 donates about 3 percent of his or her salary to charity			2
low - income workers are the most openhanded set , donating an average of 4.5 percent			2
( of course , there are many exceedingly generous high - income people			0
@entity185 has said she gives away a third of her income			0
the pastor @entity189 reverse tithes -- he gives away 90 percent of his profits from his megaselling books			1
) @entity0 : 6 ways giving makes you healthy i must confess that i have n't tithed every year since			0
i 'm a quasi tither			0
this year i donated about 7 percent of my income			2
tithing for me is a goal that i want to meet but sometimes do n't			2
( i will , however , be tithing the writer 's fee for this article			1
how can i not ? ) i 've developed some strategies to help make tithing easier			2
the key is to make it concrete			0
try thinking in terms of time			0
every ten minutes of work , you are essentially doing one minute of volunteering for the needy			0
six times an hour you 're doing a mitzvah ! since i 'm a writer , i also tell myself this : one out of every ten words belongs to someone deserving			0
in that previous sentence , it was the word deserving			0
i also try to remember what i teach my sons			0
sharing is caring , i always tell them			0
if my son had two lollipops in his pocket , and a friend asked for one , i 'd tell him to fish one out of his pocket and hand it over			0
it 's the proper thing to do			2
i should practice what i preach			2
finally , i try to think of tithing as a sort of cosmic 10 percent tip. scientists say that gratitude is like a psychological wonder drug			1
and by tithing , i 'm saying thank you to the universe -- or to @entity157 or to fate or to whatever you believe in -- for allowing me to be alive			1
i want to acknowledge how lucky i am to have food , a roof , a bed , a warm shower , and a father who did n't sacrifice me on top of a mountain			0
that deserves a donation to the @entity244 in the sky , do n't you think ? @entity0 : @entity78 ' rules to live by by @entity78 from @entity247 , @entity248 , december 2009 subscribe to @entity247 , @entity248 for up to 75 % off the newsstand price			1

@entity78 believes the ancient practice of tithing should be revived
he checks with pastor after *haggling* with wife over tithing after taxes
@entity78 : " as i gave away money , i think i might have felt @entity157 's pleasure "
says tithing is putting a 10 percent thank you in " the @entity244 in the sky "
