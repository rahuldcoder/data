@entity1 , @entity0 -- efforts to form a unity government in @entity0 failed monday , moving the country closer to a eurozone exit as the president called for another meeting tuesday to seek a solution			1
talks between @entity0 president @entity13 and the leaders of three main parties ended monday night without a resolution , the president 's office said			1
@entity13 then called a meeting for tuesday to discuss the possibility of a government run by technocrats with support from political parties , according to the leader of the socialist @entity25 party , which attended monday 's talks			1
" we have no choice " but to support the idea of a technocracy , @entity25 leader @entity27 said			0
@entity13 had invited the leaders of the @entity33 , @entity25 , @entity34 and @entity36 parties to monday night 's meeting			1
@entity34 was the only one not to attend ; the party 's leader , @entity38 , said he wanted to talk with all parties or with just the president , and not with a selected group			2
the far - left @entity34 came in second in parliamentary elections on may 6 , and polling since then has suggested it would come in first if the politicians call new elections because they can not form a government			1
the debt - wracked country has until thursday to either form a government or call new elections			1
absent a government , @entity0 could run out of money to pay its debts and might crash out of the euro , the currency used by it and 16 other @entity53 countries			1
" if no government is in place before june when the next installment ( of loan money ) from the @entity53 and @entity66 is due , we estimate that @entity0 will run out of money sometime between the end of june and beginning of july , at which point a return to the drachma would seem inevitable , " @entity60 / @entity59 wrote in a report released friday			1
@entity34 campaigned against the wildly unpopular government austerity measures that @entity0 -- under the now - ousted coalition of @entity33 and @entity25 -- agreed to in exchange for loans by international lenders			1
the @entity34 party 's goal , @entity38 said monday , is to remain in the eurozone without those " catastrophic " measures			1
but although his party rode high in opinion polls immediately after the election , survey results released monday suggested that many voters blame @entity38 for the current political deadlock			0
about two in five people say he is most at fault , according to the @entity90 opinion poll of 1,002 people conducted by telephone on may 10 - 11			0
about one in five people blamed all political leaders equally			0
about one in three people said @entity38 had taken the worst position during talks on forming a new government			2
the meeting called by @entity13 came a week after angry voters punished mainstream parties by backing a range of fringe groups and parties opposed to the government bailout			2
seven parties won seats in parliament , but none captured more than 19 % of the vote			0
that led to three failed attempts to form a new government			2
@entity36 leader @entity114 held his own meeting with @entity13 late sunday			0
so did @entity116 , the head of the far - right @entity117			0
@entity116 emerged from those talks saying that any new government would need a premier with the international clout to reject the bailout package the previous government had signed , calling the deal " a crime against our country			2
" @entity27 said his @entity25 party would do everything possible to form a national unity government , but it was ready for new elections , if necessary			1
the @entity127 , meanwhile , called for new elections , saying it will not participate in a coalition government			2
the gravity of the situation was underscored sunday by @entity38 , who told leaders , " i am concerned that if we carry on with implementation of the bailout conditions in @entity0 , then @entity0 is at risk of facing a humanitarian crisis			1
" his remarks were made in a private meeting , a transcript of which was released monday			2
in the meeting , @entity13 said the @entity146 , which has supported him , had two conditions : to ensure that the country remains in the euro and to renegotiate conditions of the bailout			0
in a poll published saturday by the newspaper @entity155 , four of five voters said they would vote the same way in a new election			0
in a separate poll published sunday by the newspaper @entity160 , seven of 10 people said they wanted the parties to form a coalition government			2
@entity34 would come in first if new elections were held , the @entity160 poll suggested , after coming in second behind @entity33 a week ago with 16.8 % of the vote			0
but the results would still lead to a deeply divided parliament , the poll suggested , with no party getting more than 21 % of the vote			0
in the same poll , six of 10 voters said @entity34 's plans against austerity are not realistic			0
@entity34 is opposed to the terms of the bailout agreed to with the @entity53 , @entity177 and @entity66			0
the country 's lenders have said that if @entity0 does not comply with the bailout terms , payments will stop			1
the stakes are potentially huge , with concern stirring that the lack of leadership could jeopardize @entity0 's bailout agreement			1
that could lead to a disorderly default by @entity0 and force the nation out of the eurozone			1
a default by @entity0 also could drag down other troubled governments such as @entity193 and @entity194			0
any financial shock of such a magnitude could plunge the region into a deep recession , with ripples being felt across the world			0
@entity2 's @entity201 and journalist @entity202 contributed to this report .			0

monday night 's talks break up without a resolution
the president calls a new meeting to discuss a possible technocracy
@entity0 has until thursday to come up with a government or call new elections
failure to form a government puts @entity0 at risk of a eurozone exit
