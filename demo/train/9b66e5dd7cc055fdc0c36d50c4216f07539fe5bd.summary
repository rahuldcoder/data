-- president @entity1 followed in the footsteps of past @entity4 leaders with a speech on wednesday at @entity7 's iconic @entity6 , where he said he would ask @entity8 to join the @entity4 in slashing its supply of strategic nuclear warheads			1
" we may no longer live in fear of global annihilation , but so long as nuclear weapons exist , we are not truly safe , " @entity1 said in the city that symbolized the @entity14 divide in the decades after @entity15 " after a comprehensive review , i 've determined that we can ensure the security of @entity4 and our allies -- and maintain a strong and credible strategic deterrent -- while reducing our deployed strategic nuclear weapons by up to one - third , " he said			1
" and i intend to seek negotiated cuts with @entity8 to move beyond @entity27 nuclear postures			1
" @entity1 's speech made repeated references to @entity7 's post-war history and the resiliency of its people			1
he called on them to manifest the same spirit that helped bring down the @entity35 to now take on broader challenges facing the modern world			0
does cutting @entity4 nukes really matter ? " complacency is not the character of great nations , " said the president , who perspired openly despite removing his suit jacket when he started speaking to a sun - drenched crowd			0
" today 's threats are not as stark as they were half - a - century ago			2
but the struggle for freedom and security and human dignity , that struggle goes on			0
" repeating his campaign themes of equal opportunity and freedom for all , @entity1 said such ideals can provide the prosperity sought by all nations -- especially longtime allies such as the @entity4 and @entity58			2
" we may enjoy a standard of living that is the envy of the world , but so long as hundreds of millions endure the agony of an empty stomach or the anguish of unemployment , we 're not truly prosperous , " @entity1 said			2
" we are more free when all people can pursue their own happiness			0
" in the city rife with @entity27 history , @entity1 also heralded democratic values that helped end communist control			1
nuclear weapons : who has what ? " because millions across this continent now breathe the fresh air of freedom , we can say here in @entity7 , here in @entity82 : our values won , " he said to cheers			1
" @entity1 's speech took place almost exactly 50 years after president @entity91 delivered his " @entity92 " -- or " @entity92 " -- speech of solidarity with @entity7 near the dividing line with the @entity96 - occupied east on the other side of the @entity35			1
@entity7 is also where president @entity98 delivered a famous line to the @entity96 in 1987 : " mr. @entity100 , tear down this wall ! " when @entity1 referred to @entity91 's speech and repeated the famous phrase , the crowd cheered			1
he also quoted from @entity91 's speech by calling on people to look " to the day of peace with justice , beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind			1
" taking on another major issue , @entity1 called for a new global effort to address climate change , citing threats such as " more severe storms , more famine and floods , new waves of refugees , coast lines that vanish , oceans that rise			2
" opinion : why @entity4 needs @entity58 now more than ever " this is the future we must avert , " he said to cheers			0
" this is the global threat of our time			0
and for the sake of future generations , our generation must move toward a global compact to confront a changing climate before it is too late			0
we have to get to work			0
" analysts said @entity1 's speech sought to entrench a presidential legacy of leadership on global issues , especially after the lofty expectations in @entity58 and elsewhere for the candidate who spoke in @entity7 five years ago have given way to the realities of the @entity149			1
" it was a president who wanted to kind of put down a stake and say , like @entity91 , like @entity98 , i share their values as an @entity4 president and these are the things i feel like i need to talk to you about today as an @entity4 president , " said @entity0 chief political analyst @entity150			1
historian @entity158 called it a " healing speech , " but said " let 's not confuse this with @entity91 's very important @entity27 talk in @entity7 or @entity98 's fighting words about ' tear down this wall			1
' " " this was not a moment that 's going to be a gold star on history 's calendar , " @entity158 told @entity0			1
opinion : no such things as a safe number of nukes beyond new start @entity1 's latest proposals on nuclear stockpiles come two years after @entity178 -- an agreement between the @entity4 and @entity8 -- went into effect			1
@entity178 , which stands for @entity180 , calls for each country to limit its nuclear warhead arsenal to 1,550 by the year 2018			2
if fully implemented , his proposals on wednesday would reduce both stockpiles by another one - third -- to roughly 1,000 warheads for each country			0
" at the same time , we 'll work with our @entity189 allies to seek bold reductions in @entity4 and @entity8 tactical weapons in @entity82 , " he said			0
after @entity178 was ratified , @entity1 ordered a detailed internal analysis of @entity4 nuclear needs and what it would take to deter other countries from attacking , the @entity192 said			2
@entity1 has also said the @entity4 will only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the @entity4 or its allies and partners			2
a @entity192 fact sheet released after the speech called @entity1 's proposals " new guidance that aligns @entity4 nuclear policies to the 21st century security environment			1
" @entity1 's guidance directed the @entity211 to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in the overall @entity4 security strategy , and narrow the focus of nuclear strategy to deterrence , the @entity192 document said			1
the proposals drew immediate criticism from the @entity220 chairman of the @entity221 , rep. @entity222 of @entity223 , who said in a statement that @entity8 already failed to adhere to existing arms - reduction agreements			0
" the president must make clear to ( @entity8 ) president ( @entity229 ) @entity228 that the @entity4 will not allow itself or its allies to be bullied by @entity8 or to allow that state to ignore its arms control obligations , " @entity222 's statement said			2
5 key points from @entity1 's news conference in @entity7 pressuring @entity235 and @entity236 the @entity4 will continue working to stop the spread of nuclear weapons , with specific pressure on @entity235 and @entity236 , a senior administration official said			1
@entity1 also will participate in the @entity242 in @entity243 , @entity244 , the official said			0
the president announced wednesday in his speech that he will host a @entity242 in 2016 to work with other countries in securing nuclear materials and preventing nuclear terrorism			2
nuclear deterrence could restrain @entity236 , @entity235 wednesday 's speech took place amid a festive atmosphere at @entity6 , where @entity1 faced the @entity254 in contrast to @entity98 's appearance when the @entity35 still divided the city			1
while the crowd was much smaller than the estimated 200,000 who jammed the area in 2008 to hear then sen. @entity1 speak , people waved @entity4 and @entity58 flags and regularly erupted in cheers and applause			0
near the front was @entity266 , known as the @entity266 for being the first to drop candy to kids during the @entity4 airlift of 1948 - 49 that supplied @entity7 following a @entity96 blockade			0
@entity1 paid tribute to that moment , noting that the 92 - year - old @entity266 , who he called " the original candy bomber , " was present			0
" we could not be prouder of him , " @entity1 said as @entity266 stood and waved			0
the president added : " i hope i look that good , by the way , when i 'm 92			0
" @entity0 's @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report .			0
