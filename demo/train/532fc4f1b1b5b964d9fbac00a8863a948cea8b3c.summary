-- a radio without any knobs			1
a bathroom where a clear display wirelessly streams vital statistics on your health			1
and a user interface that takes brain waves and translates them into commands for a computer			1
these are some of the products in development by @entity15 , a product design and development company			1
it showed off some of its latest inventions at a daylong event last week in @entity22 , @entity23			1
check out these sweet ideas , many of which are set to hit retail shelves in the next few weeks			1
@entity28 as devices become more complex to use , designers are striving for simplicity in form			1
the @entity35 internet radio tries to innovate in terms of how users can interact with it			1
it 's the first dial - free radio , say @entity15 and the @entity40 , which co-developed it			1
the cube - shaped device lets users choose radio stations or change the volume by moving the device itself			2
to select one of the four pre-set radio stations , turn the @entity50 onto one of its ' faces			2
' tilting it forward turns the volume up , and tilting it backwards turns it down			2
the device took about nine months to develop from concept to prototype			2
though pricing for it has not yet been announced , the @entity35 is expected to be available in some retail stores in the @entity61 in time for @entity62			1
@entity63 patient care is set to go beyond the doctor 's office			1
new low - power wireless technologies make it possible to implant monitoring devices in people 's bodies , to help keep an eye on blood pressure , metabolism and other vital statistics			2
but one of the challenges of these new wireless devices is designing a suitable antenna that can operate within the human body where fat , muscle and skin tissue create challenging conditions for wireless signals			2
this implantable antenna uses the 402 - @entity86 ( @entity87 ) frequency band			2
combined with a custom integrated chip or a system on a chip , device makers can use the antenna in pacemakers , neurostimulation devices , and swallowable imaging and diagnostic systems			2
connected patient there 's no dearth of health and fitness equipment , from the basic digital scale to sophisticated heart and blood pressure monitors			0
but most of these devices work independently with no easy way to share the data or discern patterns in it			0
now picture the bathroom of the future , where these devices can talk to each other and wirelessly stream information onto a single screen			0
it 's easy to do it with the @entity119 and the @entity121 specification			0
in the past , communication between medical devices was based on ad - hoc and proprietary standards , which offered limited or no interoperability			0
the latest bluetooth and @entity121 standards developed specifically for medical use changes that			0
for a user , it means , a better overall picture of your fitness and medical information			0
@entity137 taking brain waves and translating them directly into computer commands is a hot new area in user interface design			1
the idea is to help individuals who are completely paralyzed communicate without having to have surgery to implant electrodes in the brain			1
earlier brain control interface systems have been expensive , but engineers have been working to improve accuracy and bring costs down			1
the interface has three primary hardware components and several pieces of specialized software			0
a mesh cap holds small sensor electrodes firmly against the user 's head			0
an amplifier is connected to the electrodes and is used to boost the minute analog signals , measured in microvolts , that are received from the surface of the scalp			0
the signals are then converted into a digital signal and analyzed by signal processing software running on a pc			0
two monitors are connected to the pc , one for the caregiver interface and one for the user interface			0
the big challenges here are developing a sensor cap that is comfortable and can be positioned accurately on the head by an untrained person			0
positioning deviations from session to session of more than a few millimeters can dramatically affect the accuracy of the system			1
the entire system is currently expected to cost about $ 5,000 for a patient , although researchers say they are trying to bring that down			0
through - the - @entity186 police officers and special forces covet the ability to " see " through walls as they mount rescue or military operations			1
the @entity193 is a tiny handheld radar scanner that provides intelligence on the movement and location of people in a room or building			0
it works through brick and concrete walls and is sensitive enough to pick up breathing			1
users of the radar can switch between front , plan and profile views for a complete picture			0
it can also be remotely monitored			0
