" what , are you insane ? " that seems to be the response i get most from friends and family members when i tell them that i 'd like another child one day			1
they are typically shocked not because i 'm pregnant with my second child but because they 've watched me suffer through hyperemesis gravidarum during both of my pregnancies			1
they know that pregnancy for me is never a glowing and magical journey			1
rather , it is weekly trips to the emergency room , in - home @entity19 and nursing care , up to 13 medications with their assorted side effects and , of course , frequent vomiting -- sometimes as many as 20 times a day			1
although i normally choose to greet my acquaintances ' surprise with a simple smile and " we 'll see how i feel about it later , " i decided to speak out after learning that @entity33 's @entity31 and @entity32 are expecting their second child			1
the palace says @entity36 is again suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum , as she did during her first pregnancy			1
it might seem crazy to some that i would have wanted more kids after my first hyperemesis gravidarum battle , but i simply refuse to let it define my family planning			2
@entity45 manages to rob its victims of many of the joys of pregnancy			1
because you can no longer keep up with your usual obligations , you often have to share with your community that you are pregnant before you 're out of the " danger zone " of the first trimester , making you vulnerable to having to tell people later if you 've suffered a miscarriage			2
since you are so sick , what should be a happy time for you and your family becomes a nightmare , as you are unable to help around the house or spend time with other children or your partner , and are oftentimes unable to work and contribute financially			0
@entity45 even managed to take away the joy of feeling my daughter @entity66 kick once i realized her movements were setting off the nausea			1
but what hyperemesis gravidarum ca n't take away is the last 10 years of joy i 've gotten from being @entity66 's mom			2
the moment @entity66 came out , i looked at her tiny face and knew that every second of sickness , every expensive doctor 's bill , every time i 'd felt desperate and depressed and doubted myself as a mother , was worth it			1
and as soon as @entity66 was out , i felt this pang of hunger that i had n't felt in months			0
i turned to the nurse and asked when i could eat			0
about 30 minutes later , she brought me a plate of lasagna that i gobbled up and -- more important -- kept down			0
the hyperemesis gravidarum was finally gone , and the only thing left was my adorable baby , who has grown into one of the strongest little people i know and one of my closest friends			0
i never once thought about the hyperemesis gravidarum when i watched her take her first steps , perform in her preschool play , sound out her first word , present her first science fair project , compete in her first gymnastics meet or any of the other incredible memories we 've shared			0
the nine months of sickness i had with her in utero were nothing in comparison to the 10 years i 've enjoyed as her mom			2
so even on my darkest days during this pregnancy , the ones where i am reduced to a smelly , tearful , nauseated lump on the couch , i 've thought about those moments in @entity66 's life and smiled , knowing that i am going to get to experience all of those again with this daughter come february 1			2
i belong to an online community of women who have survived or are currently suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum , sort of a support group and resource community all in one			0
from time to time , someone will write a post saying they are at their wit 's end , ready to give up , or feel like they are losing their mind			0
within minutes , the responses will pour in : photos of recently born babies from hyperemesis gravidarum survivors , descriptions of a new milestone someone 's little one has achieved and even tales from women still suffering with hyperemesis gravidarum of how much better they are feeling that particular week			0
i love when a few weeks later , the original poster comments on someone else 's post to tell them how they survived those desperate times and found the strength to keep going			0
surviving acute pregnancy sickness : my story although there were some moments where i wanted to give up , hyperemesis gravidarum has made me appreciate my life and my family so much more than i ever could have if i had n't been sick			1
perhaps , next time someone asks me if i 've lost my mind , i 'll simply hold up a picture of my daughter and tell them " absolutely not			0

@entity45 causes *extreme* sickness during pregnancy
home nursing care , ivs and medications can help
one mother says the joy of having a child is worth it
