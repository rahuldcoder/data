the rolling hills that surround the city of @entity2 in northern @entity3 once helped the bustling @entity5 capital earn its reputation as the @entity7 of the @entity8			1
beneath the verdant greenery which dominates this ancient landscape , however , lies the source of the region 's prosperity -- lots of oil and gas			1
