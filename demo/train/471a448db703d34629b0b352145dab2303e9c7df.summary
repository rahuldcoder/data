@entity0 -- @entity4 's @entity3 was recovering friday after being readmitted to a @entity0 hospital for surgery on his right hip , the @entity2 said			1
an update on the 74 - year - old king 's condition is expected later in the day , according to the palace			1
the surgery was performed thursday at @entity13 to " reduce a dislocation " of the hip , a palace statement said			2
he underwent hip replacement surgery earlier this month after falling while on a controversial private hunting trip in @entity19			1
the @entity21 trip caused an outcry in @entity4 and abroad for its expense during the nation 's economic crisis and for including the hunting of elephants			1
last week , the king made a rare apology over the trip , saying he had made a mistake which would not happen again			2
@entity4 generally hold the king in high regard for his service to the nation and his defense of democracy after the death of the dictator @entity39 in 1975 -- especially the king 's decisive stand to halt a right - wing military coup in 1981			0
but after news emerged of the expensive hunting trip , with widespread @entity4 media reports that it included the hunting of elephants , even normally - staunch political allies of the monarch said publicly that they considered the timing of the trip a mistake			1
the criticism of the trip initially focused on the expensive safari in the midst of the nation 's deep crisis , with 23 % unemployment , 5 million @entity4 out of work , and the government applying austerity cuts and tax increases to make up for budget shortfalls			0
the king himself had previously expressed his concern over the impact of the crisis on @entity4 and called on the nation to come together to get through the tough times			0
the royal household has a budget of 8.26 million euros ( $ 10.8 million ) this year , 2 % less than last year , and had recently announced cuts of about $ 222,000 , including trimming salaries of the highest - paid staffers at the royal palace			0
some critics also wondered how much public money was spent for security on the king 's private trip			2
animal rights activists also voiced criticism , as reports emerged that the king was hunting elephants			0
at least one photo , said to be from an earlier trip , showed the king , rifle in hand , standing in front of a dead elephant			1
it was widely published in @entity4 media , which said it was taken from the website of an african safari outfitter , and that the photo was later removed from the company 's site			0
