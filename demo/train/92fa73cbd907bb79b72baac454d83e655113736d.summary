-- the @entity3 organization 's issues with race go beyond one inflammatory email or offensive comments on one conference call , the team 's ceo said , before promising fans that those systemic problems will be corrected			1
" as an organization , we must own these shortcomings and failures , " @entity12 wrote in an open letter saturday to his team , fans and the city of @entity17			1
" ... we should build bridges through basketball , not divide our community or serve as a source of pain			1
" @entity12 's comments come a day after general manager @entity27 began an indefinite leave of absence tied to controversial comments he made in june about @entity31 , then a prospective free agent player			1
and they occurred six days after the franchise 's owner , @entity34 , announced he would sell his controlling interest team in light of a 2012 email that many derided as racist			2
in the same announcement last sunday setting the stage for @entity34 's exit , the @entity40 said that @entity12 will oversee team operations during the ownership transition			1
the @entity3 ceo did not mention @entity34 or @entity46 specifically in his letter saturday , nor did he delve into detail into their or possible other cases			1
but he did say that " we enough today , based on investigations conducted by the league , by external legal counsel on behalf of the team and information that has appeared in the media , that our shortcomings are beyond a single email , a single person or a single event			0
" to the contrary , over a period of years , we have found that there have been inflammatory words , phrases , inferences and innuendos about race , " @entity12 said			1
" we as an organization did not correct these failures			2
we did not do the right thing			0
" @entity12 then laid out four key steps aimed at addressing the issue : @entity12 ended his letter with an appeal to rally around the team 's players , rather than abandon them out of frustration			1
" we ask our fans to continue to support our players as we all learn through this process -- we should not punish them , " he said			0
" we aim to win as a collective team both on and off the court			0
" ceo : incidents ' put a blemish on our team and our city ' the issue of race , and the prospect of alienating african - americans , takes on added significance in @entity17 , given its history and makeup			1
the home of the rev. @entity99 and other civil rights leaders , @entity17 was one of the few large @entity103 cities not to see major race - related disruptions during the 1960s as it earned the reputation as " the city too busy to hate			1
" today , @entity3 is led by a black mayor in @entity111 and its population is 54 % @entity113 , according to the @entity114			2
all but a handful of players on the @entity3 roster are black			2

he said , too , that the team 's cheerleaders were black and hip - hop , rap and gospel music was likely to be heard in the arena			0
" then i start looking around at other arenas			0
even ( @entity133 ) @entity133 with its affluent black community never has more than a 15 pct black audience , " @entity34 wrote			0
the @entity3 ' controlling owner then offered his thoughts on why more whites did n't attend games : " my theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a significant season ticket base			1
" i never felt uncomfortable , but i think southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority			0
" @entity34 then outlined steps to take , like asking for more " music familiar to a 40 year old white guy " and that camera shots and " the kiss cam " do n't focus as much on black fans			2
he said changes had shifted the crowd makeup , by his estimates , to 40 % @entity113 as of 2012			0
still , @entity34 insisted that african - americans ' lack of " spendable income " and whites being uncomfortable in an arena with many blacks was still " far and away the number one reason our season ticket base is so low			0
