-- more than a week after the @entity2 military ousted the @entity4 - led presidency of @entity5 , the @entity6 , from which @entity5 hails , continue to mobilize their followers on the streets and demand the reinstatement of @entity5			1
far from backing down , the @entity4 organization has pledged to resist what it has called a " fascist coup , " and has rejected any dialogue with the transitional government that does not restore the popularly elected @entity5			0
opinion : @entity2 's secularists repeating @entity18 ' mistakes for the military , the @entity6 's demand is a non-starter , and both camps and their supporters face a deadlock that can now only be broken through either a political compromise or an all - out confrontation			1
there is a real danger of further polarization and escalation in @entity2 , where the writing is already on the wall with the arrest of @entity5 and the demonization of the @entity6 by the @entity2 media and elements of the secular - leaning opposition			1
analysis : will @entity2 's @entity6 survive ? the interim authorities are clamping down on the @entity6 , accusing senior leaders of inciting violence while arresting eight of its top figures , including the group 's most influential leader , @entity47 , and the former speaker of parliament			1
prosecutors have also issued another arrest warrant for the @entity6 's supreme guide , @entity53 , and four others			1
human rights organizations have criticized the government 's clampdown on the @entity6 's television channel and others channels sympathetic to the group , as well as the deaths of dozens of protesters in recent weeks			1
@entity0 explains : what is the @entity6 ? the @entity6 can not politically afford to climb down because that would be an acknowledgment of their defeat and probably cause cleavages within their social base			1
so instead they will continue to peacefully resist and flex their muscle and exert pressure on the country 's interim rulers			0
the goal is to force the military - led authority to come to terms with the @entity6 and stop persecuting them			1
" the goal of our peaceful mass rallies and peaceful sit - ins in squares across @entity2 is to force the coup plotters to reverse their action , " @entity77 , acting head of the @entity6 's @entity79 , said on his @entity81 page			1
if history is our guide , in the short and midterm , @entity4 leaders will prioritize unity and solidarity of the organization			0
the @entity6 have already begun to mobilize tens thousands of followers , a task made easier by a strongly - held belief that the @entity18 are defending constitutional legitimacy against military putschists			1
opinion : overthrow of @entity6 leader ' has international reverberations ' as one of the most powerfully organized social and political movements in @entity2 and the region , the @entity6 can rely on its power base , which represents between 20 to 30 percent of the electorate , to remain a force to be reckoned with either at the ballot box or in the streets			1
in the eyes of the @entity6 leadership , conceding defeat would harm the base and fracture it			1
the advantages of resistance outweigh any potential disadvantages ; the 85 - year old @entity4 organization is better equipped to endure repression by the @entity123 military than internal dissention and fragmentation			0
it is worth remembering that mainstream islamists of the @entity6 variety have survived decades of persecution , incarceration , and exile by military - led authoritarian regimes -- and they will most likely weather the latest coup that has swept away @entity5			1
despite concerted efforts in the last six decades by secular strongmen like the late @entity2 president @entity136 to weaken and isolate their religious rivals , the @entity18 ' close - knit networks and " asabiya " ( group loyalty ) have allowed them to withstand the brutal onslaught of secular authorities and grow their organization			2
opinion : @entity2 are fed up with @entity5 in my interviews with the @entity4 rank - and - file over the past 20 years in @entity2 and elsewhere , it has become clear to me that religious activists are nourished on a belief in the movement 's divine victory and they are willing to endure sacrifice , hardship , and loss to bring about that desired end			2
but the decades of persecution that drove the @entity18 underground left deep scars on their psychology and imagination -- and as a result , they often view wider society as intrinsically hostile to their cause			0
the @entity2 military 's ouster of @entity5 will reinforce this siege mentality and the sense of victimhood and injustice among the @entity6 and their followers			1
the likelihood of the @entity6 taking up arms against the military like their @entity177 counterparts in the early 1990s is minimal			2
the most influential @entity4 group in the @entity180 world renounced the use of force and violence in the late 1960s and early 1970s			0
one of the lessons learned by the @entity6 from their experience underground from the 1940s until the late 1960s is that violence is counterproductive and endangers the very survival of the movement			2
in particular , the old guard , including @entity53 , who have a vivid institutional memory of the underground years , wo n't fall into the trap of militarily confronting the state ; they would not risk it all			0
the real potential danger is that individual members could join extremist groups in the @entity200 desert and elsewhere to exact vengeance against @entity2 's security forces			1
if the political deadlock continues , the @entity6 might not be able or willing to control some of its followers , a recipe for creeping armed clashes with the security apparatus			2
the longer the @entity6 continue their protests and resistance , the more likely the military is to intensify its crackdown against them			2
at this stage , it is unconceivable that the military would reinstate @entity5 as his supporters demand -- far from it , in fact			0
in his first address , as an interim president last week , @entity217 , previously head of the constitutional court , warned against stoking unrest and promised to fight those he said wanted to destabilize the state			0
his warning is designed to convey a message to the @entity6 by the military			2
" we are going through a critical stage and some want us to move towards chaos , and we want to move towards stability			0
some want a bloody path , " @entity217 said in a televised address			0
" we will fight a battle for security until the end			0
" the interim governing body is rapidly shaping up with a newly - formed cabinet and a roadmap for drafting a constitution and then holding presidential and parliamentary elections			0
the interim authority has obtained de facto legitimation and recognition at home and abroad			1
the islamists are pitted against an influential alliance composed of a substantive segment of @entity2 , together with the military , the police and entrenched elements of the old regime			2
@entity255 secretary of state @entity254 telephoned @entity2 's new foreign minister , @entity256 , and expressed hopes that the transitional period of government would be successful , according to the @entity2 foreign ministry			2
neither the @entity262 administration nor the @entity263 has taken the military to task for toppling @entity5			0
the @entity266 , particularly @entity267 , the @entity268 and @entity269 , have already pledged $ 12 billion in financial and material aid , a substantial package that gives the transitional authority breathing space to get its economic house in order			0
there is a race against time between escalation and a political dialogue , and neither the military nor @entity5 's supporters are disposed to compromise			0
while the military is emboldened and in charge , the @entity6 have their backs against the wall			0
regardless of the outcome , this titanic and seemingly intractable struggle undermines @entity2 's fragile democratic experiment because there is a real danger that once again the @entity18 will be suppressed and excluded from the country 's political space			1
this does not bode well for @entity2 's democratic transition because there will be no institutionalization of democracy without the @entity6 , the biggest and oldest mainstream religiously based @entity4 movement in the @entity298			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity301 .			0

he argues there will be no institutionalization of democracy without the @entity6
