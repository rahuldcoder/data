-- here 's a question that seems to be lost in the debate over the @entity4 independence vote scheduled for september 18 : if @entity4 votes to secede , does that open up a spot for another country ? and if so -- @entity4 , can we take your place ? i realize that @entity13 fought a bloody war of independence from @entity16 in the late 1700s , but our rifts have healed over the past 240 years			1
in 2013 , the @entity18 reported that @entity16 topped @entity13 's list of favorite nations , in a near - tie with our beloved northern neighbor , @entity23			1
in the past few years , as @entity13 has degenerated into political and economic chaos , it has become increasingly clear that we would be far better off if we apologized for our revolt against the @entity27 and requested to rejoin the @entity28			1
there are four main ways @entity13 would benefit from unification with the @entity28 : @entity32 have better health , less inequality , excellent manners and -- let 's face it -- a superior culture			1
let 's improve our quality of life by joining them			0
want to live longer ? then let 's become @entity43 â € ” the 50 - state replacement for @entity4			1
@entity32 have greater longevity than @entity13 , and the @entity28 health care system , while far from perfect , is indescribably better than ours			1
in my visits to the @entity28 , i 've noticed that just about anyone who can afford private health insurance buys it , which allows @entity32 to supplement their free , government - provided health care			1
that means there 's a baseline of care that every person receives , and if you want something faster or better , you pay for it yourself			0
meanwhile , @entity13 's needlessly complicated arrangement of government - and employer - provided health care , in a clumsy compromise with insurance companies , costs way more than other developed countries ' while producing worse results			1
next , @entity28 is a more equitable society			2
although @entity13 has a higher gdp per capita , most of us -- that is , the 99 % -- are not happy because of our ever - widening wealth gap			2
@entity32 have less inequality , and their median incomes ( unlike ours ) have risen in the past decade			1
@entity13 's middle class used to be the richest in the world ; now we 're overtaken by @entity23			2
unless you are the 1 % in @entity13 , chances are your wages are stagnant			2
living a good life -- owning a house and a car and being able to support a family -- seems like a struggle , especially when compared with your parents ' generation			0
americans could also learn a few lessons from the @entity32 when it comes to good manners			1
when i took students with me to film news reports of the 2012 olympics in @entity96 , we dealt with unimaginable crowds on the street , in the shopping centers and on the @entity100			0
did we hear groans of exasperation when we accidentally bumped into @entity32 in @entity103 while trying to get a better view of @entity105 ? never			2
did we see looks of frustration when our cameras accidentally knocked into innocent people in @entity110 ? not even once			0
this patience and politeness stands in stark contrast to the attitude in big @entity13 cities , where cab drivers curse at you just for your mere existence , and @entity120 agents at @entity13 airports compete for the title of @entity123			2
finally , @entity13 would benefit from a closer association with @entity28 's culture			1
the country that produced @entity127 , the world 's best storyteller , has also given us some of the best entertainment and media of modern times			0
our imitation of @entity28 television ( e.g. " @entity134 " ) speaks for itself			2
has any band ever topped the @entity136 ? and nothing against @entity138 and @entity139 , but the @entity140 produces some of the best publicly funded journalism , putting much of the world 's radio and television news programs to shame			0
the world respects the @entity28 , in part , because the @entity140 is so trustworthy			0
that 's called soft power			0
but wait , you ask			0
what 's in it for the @entity32 ? three things			0
natural resources ( oh so much land ! ) , the majestic @entity155 and a sport called " @entity157			0
" they 'll love it			0
so remember , @entity13 , if @entity4 votes for independence on september 18 , let 's improve our lives by asking to take their place -- if not officially , then at least in spirit			1
we hold this truth to be self - evident : @entity32 have a superior society			1
@entity13 claim we do n't want a monarchy , but deep down , we 're just as hungry as our @entity28 cousins for news about @entity172 , princes @entity173 and @entity174 , and those adorable royal babies			1
@entity16 , will you take us back ?			0

@entity4 is voting on a *referendum* for independence from @entity16 on september 18
@entity181 : if @entity4 secedes , can @entity13 take its place ?
he offers four main ways why @entity13 would benefit from unification with the @entity28
@entity181 : @entity32 have better health , manners , less inequality and superior culture
