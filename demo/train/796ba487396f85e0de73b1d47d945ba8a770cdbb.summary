what do these three technologies have in common ? they all pretty much work as promised			2
they all seem like good ideas on paper			0
and they 're all too dorky to live			2
now , far be it from me to claim that nerdiness equals lack of popularity potential			0
but i contend that dorkiness and nerdiness are two different qualities			0
while nerdiness implies a certain social awkwardness that 's ultimately endearing , dorkiness connotes social obliviousness that opens you to deserved ridicule			0
guess which category @entity25 will fall under when it goes " mainstream ? " forget about the privacy concerns for a second			1
i do n't think you have to get that serious to recognize the inherent antisocialness of @entity25			1
all you have to do is look at the guy in the picture at the top of this post			0
or any of the rest of the guys on @entity38 , a new @entity39 that serves up the data needed to transform the hypothesis " @entity25 is too dorky to succeed " into a proven scientific theory			1
disagree ? the floor is open for falsification			0
start your own @entity39 : people who look cool while wearing @entity25			1
before its release , some of the smartest people in tech predicted that the @entity52 would change the world			2
and even when the world joined in a collective " huh ? " when the much - hyped secret @entity56 project was revealed to be a gyro - balanced scooter , the idea still kind of made sense			2
if we were all riding around on @entity52 now , cities would probably be better places to live compared to the car - infested streets we still endure			0
but that transformation has n't happened			2
why ? because @entity52 are lame			0
they fail to acknowledge all the irrational reasons people love their cars			0
similarly , @entity25 fails to acknowledge that walking around with a camera mounted on the side of your face at all times makes you look dorky			1
think of the @entity3 headset : it 's a really sensible way to use your phone without having to take it out of your pocketâ € ” so sensible that there 's really no reason not to keep that headset in your ear most of the time			1
but you do n't , do you ? there 's a reason that @entity89 put a @entity3 headset on @entity91 in its recurring " two a-holes " sketches			1
@entity25 , like the @entity52 , is what happens when @entity96 spends too much time talking to itself			1
maybe that 's even overstating the case : the rhetoric around @entity25 is what happens when important tech people spend a little too much time congratulating each other			1
there 's really nothing wrong with @entity25 as a technological experiment			1
the future will include some kind of wearable smart technology , and it 's important for @entity112 to be experimenting in that direction			0
but @entity112 co-founder @entity115 's presentation at @entity116 , in which he characterized wearing @entity25 as somehow more macho than pulling your smartphone out of your pocket , underscores the tone - deafness that can envelop @entity96 when vips get a little too excited about the @entity122			1
@entity115 , after all , is a guy who thinks nothing of engaging in spontaneous yoga in the middle of a crowded tech conference			0
this is n't a bad thingâ € ” on the nerd to dork scale , it definitely tilts toward " nerd			2
" but if you 're one of the shareholders helping to keep @entity112 's shares trading above $ 800 , the dork factor of @entity25 should give you pause			1
@entity112 is still trying to crack the secret of monetizing mobile technology , which so far has n't proven as lucrative as its desktop search business			2
@entity25 may be a fun experiment in building another mobile platform to attract as - yet - unimagined revenue streams			1
but making money on consumer technology requires that consumers embrace that technology			0
if @entity25 makes you look as cool as the guys in that @entity39 , that embrace is about as likely to happen as you hugging a segway			1
or @entity149 in the shower			0

early *adopters* might make @entity25 seem dorky
like @entity3 headsets , @entity25 is *lopsided* , with a camera on one lens
*writer* says @entity25 is what happens when @entity96 does n't get the real world
