-- i was 23 and a graduate trainee journalist when @entity3 survived an ambush in @entity5 that robbed her of an eye			1
to me , she was already part of a small band of women war correspondents , starting with @entity10 , who were my role models			2
to me , these women lived the story , gave voice to the voiceless and urged the myopic world to sit up and give a damn			2
the romantic in me yearned for their life of exotic travel , dangerous liaisons and hushed confidences over drinks and cigarettes in dingy bars , where stories were written and lifelong friendships made			0
the realist in me did not understand the risks then			0
it was n't until later that i realised i am not brave enough to be like @entity3 and some of the women i 've met in my work			1
i 've travelled to some dark places and reported from some danger zones , but nothing of the magnitude that she and they have encountered			0
i had first come across @entity39 while doing work experience on the foreign desk at the @entity42			1
to a young , hungry , aspiring foreign correspondent , she was an inspiration			2
but her experience in @entity5 several years later gave her added gravitas in my eyes			0
she was a survivor in a world where safety had not yet really become part of the culture and conversation in news rooms and , even then , in the years before the inexorable rise of social media raised the stakes and cacophony of information for traditional journalists , she was a rare breed			2
having decided in the wake of the devastating earthquake in @entity63 that i no longer wanted to report from these so - called hostile environments , that i no longer wished to do so as the mother of a small daughter , i now work for the @entity67 , a charity that provides safety advice and training to journalists working in dangerous situations			1
at @entity67 , i 've seen the risks journalists take and face across the world and i 've learned about the people whose names and lives are hidden behind the statistics -- who represent the 120 or so men and women working in the news media killed every year trying to do their job			1
unlike @entity3 , most of them are n't well - known journalists , reporting for famous newspapers			1
most come from countries like @entity88 , the @entity89 and @entity90 , where ineffective governments and corrupt officials , businesspeople and gangs want to silence them			0
along with @entity95 and @entity96 , @entity3 is probably the best known journalist to die whilst covering the @entity97			1
however , almost 30 more news media workers have died doing their jobs since the uprisings took root across the @entity102 last year			0
with their unknown names and faces , they are unlike her			0
but like @entity3 , they are men and women who felt compelled to fight against injustice , armed only with their words and images			1
@entity3 knew that no war was risk free			1
and , after @entity5 , she knew that more than most			0
but she knew too that journalists have a responsibility in helping write that first rough draft of history			2
in a speech that 's been much quoted in the past 24 hours , which she gave at a service in 2010 paying tribute to journalists killed in their work , she said : " our mission is to report these horrors of war with accuracy and without prejudice			1
we always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story			0
what is bravery , and what is bravado ? " there are many who turned back before @entity3			1
her mother said she wanted to finish " one more story "			0
her bosses urged her to leave the besieged @entity143 city of @entity144			0
one friend , the @entity146 's @entity145 , says he sensed in her a vulnerability he 'd not seen before in the days before she left for @entity143			0
shortly before she died , she told another friend , @entity149 ' @entity148 , that it was the " worst they 'd ever seen "			2
and , yet she felt compelled to continue shining a light on the worst suffering humans can inflict on each other , to give voice to the voiceless and expose the truth - in her case at a terrible price			1
her death and that of the brilliant @entity162 photographer @entity161 have highlighted risks that journalists take to do their jobs			2
it has shown that there still remains a rare breed of talented , humane journalist who believes it is worth risking everything to tell the story of the victims of war			0
at @entity67 , we want to pay tribute to @entity3 and the men and women like her			1
i hope her death will make the world sit up and realize what 's going on in @entity143 and i hope her death will make people realize the risks that journalists across the world take every day to bring home the news			2
@entity3 remains for me a role model , the @entity10 of her generation : an extraordinary woman who combined grit and glamour			1
women like her are rare in an industry long dominated by men			0
often the risks they face are no different from their male counterparts			2
but , on many occasions they are			0
at @entity67 , we 're launching a book dedicated to the safety of women journalists			1
in it , 40 women from around the world , including @entity0 's @entity207 , tell of covering war and civil unrest , corruption and disaster			0
they detail episodes of desperate detention , of kidnap , assault , extraordinary escapes and moments of awe - inspiring bravery , as they share their experiences of being a female journalist			0
the decision to put together this unique book was triggered by the terrible attack on @entity225 in @entity226 last year			0
it went to print just days before @entity3 's death			1
" no woman 's land : on the @entity233 " will be published on march 8 , @entity232			0
it will be launched with a tribute to @entity3			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			1

former reporter @entity238 says @entity3 was an inspiration to journalists
storm , of @entity67 , says reporters face dangers in course of work
storm : @entity253 " shone a light on the worst suffering humans can inflict on each other "
