at least several paranormal investigators , all of whom promise to have witnessed the supernatural , told @entity0 they believe it to be true			2
that 's why we 've taken cues from experienced investigators and experts for fright - inspired destination ideas this @entity14 season			1
here are some of their favorites			2
@entity18 , @entity19 located on @entity18 's @entity21 across from @entity22 , the @entity20 has a glamorous history : @entity24 was the hotel 's most famous resident			1
it turns out , she might still be there , according to @entity28 and @entity29			2
paranormal authors and investigators , the @entity30 were filming at the hotel with several productions			1
@entity29 was explaining the history of the hotel 's most famous mirror , in front of which many visitors have had psychic experiences			1
" and as we were standing there , a gentleman just jumped back like he 'd been shoved and he said , ' who do you think you are ? ' well that stopped production and we had to find out , " @entity28 said			2
" i asked the man what had happened			2
he said , ' well this blonde lady came running like she owns @entity18 and pushes me aside			1
' " if you go : you can simply book a room at the hotel			1
if you want to try to spot @entity24 , the hotel offers a " @entity24 package " ( $ 1,800/night ) which includes a stay in the @entity24 suite and tickets to the @entity24 exhibit			1
@entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 with a history dating back to the late 1800s , the @entity60 in @entity61 began as the @entity64			2
indeed , one of the ghosts still said to roam the bed and breakfast is @entity69			2
visitors trade reports of possible deaths on the property , which may fuel activity			1
the hotel was featured on " @entity76 " in 2009 , an @entity78 cable network program that aired until 2011			1
if you go : you can go for dinner and the " @entity83 " show and tour , and book a room at the bed and breakfast			2
the @entity60 also hosts several " @entity87 weekends , " with the next available dates in january , 2014			2
the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity19 one of the @entity30 ' most memorable visits is " right on the tourist map , but it still packs a metaphysical punch , " @entity91 said			2
" and that 's the @entity89 in old @entity90			1
" the @entity19 house has a long history ; and , like its home state , the house has been many things at different times , with origins dating back to the 1800s and including several hangings			2
" it just kept growing , " @entity28 said			2
" it started as , the judge , his home			0
then it became a courthouse and his home			0
then it became a theater and his home			0
then there were hangings that took place in the backyard and eventually that hanging area , where people were hanged , became part of the house			0
" while investigating , @entity29 said she captured psychic phenomena on film -- a picture of a noose , coming right down in the room			0
" i had no inkling anything would develop and lo and behold , there were so many pictures , " she said			0
what should have been a photo of one of the beds instead revealed a ghostly figure , just waking up			0
if you go : now a museum , tourists can take tours			0
@entity139 , @entity140 first christened as a lighthouse in 1824 ( it started out as a watchtower ) the structure lost a long battle with the shoreline before collapsing during a storm in 1880			1
luckily , its successor had already been completed in 1874			0
that lighthouse is now @entity139 's oldest structure -- a status that has given it plenty of time to attract " visitors			1
" what 's more , a keeper 's house was added to the grounds in 1876 and people lived and worked the lighthouse for decades , until 1955			1
the unexpected was at play at the lighthouse when investigator @entity165 and his team visited			1
they believed they would disprove the reports of activity , finding " just local sounds and things of that nature			1
" " and we actually caught some of the ' holy grail , ' what appeared to be people leaning over rails , showing up on thermal , showing up on infrared when there 's no one else in there , " said @entity165 , founder of the @entity174 and one of the stars and producers of @entity179 's long - running " @entity178			1
" if you go : while other tours are available , the " @entity194 " tour is billed as " the only ghost tour that gets you in the tower			0
" @entity195 , @entity196 the town of @entity195 has its share of haunted history			0
no wonder : approximately 7,000 people died -- both @entity203 and @entity204 soldiers -- during the @entity205 at the heart of the @entity207			0
( about another 3,500 died in the weeks and months following the battle			0
) @entity209 , founder of the @entity210 and host of @entity78 's " @entity76 , " remembers getting shot there			1
" we were taking a ghost tour of @entity195 ( @entity216 ) and suddenly i was having trouble breathing ... i was wheezing and i was having trouble breathing and the pain , it got worse , " @entity209 said			0
@entity209 went to the hospital , and the doctors ran some tests			0
" long story short , suddenly they come running back and they tear off my shirt and they said something like , ' where 's the exit wound ? ' " @entity209 said			1
but no exit wound ever appeared on his body			0
if you go : there are several @entity195 ghost tours , including @entity236 ( which is hosted by a former park ranger )			0
@entity238 and @entity239 older cities such as @entity238 , @entity241 , and @entity239 , @entity242 , remind tourists that they just might be walking on bones			0
@entity239 is " literally built on its dead , " @entity165 said			0
" when they 're going to put up buildings , they have to do tests , core samples , to see if they find any bones			0
" @entity253 , founder of one of the city 's popular walking ghost tours and author of " @entity258 , " said that the @entity259 is one of his favorite local spots			1
the @entity259 , first built in the 1800s , is proud of its paranormal history , with an entire section of the website devoted to people 's experiences			1
the inn 's most famous resident is @entity270 , who reportedly fell from a window to her death , though the event is clouded with rumor			1
@entity238 is no less spooky -- especially the @entity275 , which is famous for the prisoners kept locked behind its bars , including @entity278 , often thought of as @entity1 's first female mass murderer			1
if you go : @entity239 visitors can book a room at the @entity259			1
@entity238 features many tours , with the @entity284 , @entity238 's @entity87 and @entity285 among the options			1
@entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 @entity290 , in @entity288 is fairly new as a paranormal hotspot , at least measured against the decades - or centuries - plus history of some of the other locales on our list			0
owned and operated by @entity299 -- whose resume includes minister , counselor , author and radio host -- the ranch distinguishes itself in other ways : @entity209 said he was " guaranteed " to experience activity on his first visit , a rare and rarely true claim			0
@entity299 " claimed he was being visited by aliens , all the time , and that there were supernatural beings on his property , " @entity209 said			0
so a friend , another paranormal aficionado , took up the claim and reported back			0
" he 's like , ' i swear to you , all night long we had experiences in this place ... every night , something happened , ' " @entity209 said			1
a big ball of light would appear and then split up into triangles and then regroup -- circling and darting unnaturally , according to @entity209 's friend			1
many people claim to have experienced contact with extraterrestrial life at the ranch , with anecdotes spread across the @entity334			1
if you go : contact the ranch to schedule a private tour			0
) @entity339 , @entity340 @entity340 's @entity339 is synonymous with the story of the @entity342 , an extraterrestrial creature sighted throughout the town in the late 1960s and made famous by the book " @entity348 , " later adapted as a film starring @entity347			1
the town boasts several landmarks , including the @entity350 , which depicts the creature as a silvery humanoid , with teeth bared			0
the @entity354 is nearby , offering an easy second stop on any personalized ghost tour			0
not only does it house the @entity358 , the hotel is home to a small coterie of otherworldly figures			2
many people assume the experiences in the town have stopped			0
while he was visiting , @entity209 had some " really crazy experiences , " including a brush with the @entity342 that involved an underground munitions bunker , a voice - activated tape recorder and a psychic			0
" you want to talk about something right out of ' @entity373 ' -- here 's @entity339 , " he said			1
