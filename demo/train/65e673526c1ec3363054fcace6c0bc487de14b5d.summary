a total of 31 spent rounds were recovered from the scene , it said in a statement tuesday night			1
the law enforcement official told @entity2 authorities are still on the scene of the shooting with a piece of equipment called a total station			1
it is a type of surveying equipment that takes precise measurements that can be used to reconstruct a crime scene			1
@entity4 has been anecdotally regarded as very troubled and perhaps mentally unbalanced because of his ramblings spotted on the internet and the way he has been described by acquaintances			1
his family asked for privacy during a " very difficult time for us			1
" " there are no words that can possibly express how we feel			1
we wish that there were , so we could make you feel better			1
we do n't understand why this happened , " the family said in its statement			1

we care very deeply about the victims and their families			1
we are so very sorry for their loss			2

" her status is the same as it was yesterday			2
she 's still following simple commands			2
" @entity99 said @entity7 was generating her own breaths			2
" the only reason we keep that breathing tube in is to protect her airway so that she does n't have complications like pneumonia , " he told reporters			1
@entity99 said he 's encouraged by the fact that she 's " done so well " with an injury where survival and recovery are " abysmal			2
" " we 're hopeful , but i do want to underscore the seriousness of this injury and the fact that we all have to be extremely patient , " @entity99 said			2

@entity257 , a criminal defense attorney and a former prosecutor , and @entity260 , a clinical and forensic psychologist , said on @entity2 's " @entity261 " on tuesday they have doubts that an insanity plea would stand			0

" you really have to prove that your mental illness is so severe that you do n't even understand that you 're committing a criminal act			0
