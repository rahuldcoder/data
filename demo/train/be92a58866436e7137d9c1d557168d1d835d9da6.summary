@entity0 , @entity1 -- the cause of a mysterious illness that has claimed the lives of more than 60 @entity1 children has been determined , medical doctors familiar with the investigation told @entity2 on wednesday			1
a combination of pathogens , disease - causing micro-organisms , is to blame for the illness , the @entity16 , in conjunction with the @entity1 @entity11 , has concluded , the doctors said			1
the pathogens include enterovirus 71 , which is known to cause neurological disease ; streptococcus suis , which can cause infections like bacterial meningitis in people who have close contact with pigs or with pork products ; and dengue , which is transmitted by mosquitoes			1
the inappropriate use of steroids , which can suppress the immune system , worsened the illness in a majority of the patients , the doctors said			1
the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) is expected to advise health care workers to refrain from using steroids in patients with signs and symptoms of the infection , which include severe fever , encephalitis and breathing difficulties			1
while not all the microorganisms were present in each patient , doctors concluded the illness was caused by a combination of them and worsened by steroid use			1
the @entity16 sources did not want to be identified because the results of the health organization 's investigation have not yet been made public			0
" i 'm very confident for the reason of the epidemic , " said dr. @entity53 , chief of virology at the @entity55 in @entity1 and one of the doctors who cracked the case			1
" the first thing that goes through your mind is , is this one of the usual suspects you have n't detected before ? " said dr. @entity60 , chief of epidemiology and public health at the @entity55			0
" if it is , has it mutated , or changed in a way that it causes more severe disease ? or is it something completely new ? " on the steroids issue , @entity60 said , " when you have a dying child , you try to use what you have at hand , and they were right to try that			2
" but , he acknowledged , " from the cases we reviewed , almost all of the children died , and almost all of them had steroids			1
" parents face anxious wait over mystery illness " i think we can close the case and move ahead asking different questions , " @entity53 said			0
" not what is the illness , but now , how long has the virus been circulating ? what is the extent of the circulation of the virus ? how many mild diseases are we missing ? that 's the next step			0
" over the past four months , doctors at @entity101 in @entity0 have been faced with the mysterious syndrome , which kills children so fast that nearly all of those infected with it die within a day or two of being admitted to the hospital			2
dr. @entity107 , head of the children 's hospitals -- which cared for 66 patients affected by the illness , 64 of whom died -- said that no new cases of the illness had been confirmed since saturday			1
other hospitals in the country have reported similar cases , but far fewer than the children 's hospitals in the capital , which are the most popular			2
in the last hours of their life , the children experienced a " total destruction of the alveola ( e ) in the lungs , " @entity107 said			0
@entity126 are the air sacs where oxygen enters the bloodstream			0
most of the children who have contracted the illness have come from the south of the country , though health officials can not find what is known as a cluster -- a lot of cases coming from one specific area			2
by june 29 , the @entity16 had been contacted and @entity1 officials were scrambling to instruct health providers across the country to spread information about the illness as quickly as possible			1
officials search for clues in disease killing @entity1 's children the @entity16 and the @entity1 authorities ' announcement of the situation drew criticism from @entity107 , who said they were " causing unnecessary panic			1
" the @entity16 said the unexplained nature of the outbreak obliged it to communicate the information			0
over the weekend , lab tests linked enterovirus 71 ( @entity160 ) to some of the cases			1
but the tests did n't solve the whole puzzle and health officials continued their investigations , noting the detection of other elements like streptococcus suis and dengue			1
the link to @entity160 does not particularly help in the treatment of the illness , as there is no effective antiviral treatment for severe @entity160 infections and no vaccine is available			0
in milder cases , @entity160 can cause coldlike symptoms , diarrhea and sores on the hands , feet and mouth , according to the journal @entity185			2
but more severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain , resulting in polio - like paralysis and death			2
outbreaks of the enterovirus " occur periodically in the @entity191 , " according to the @entity194			2
@entity195 had its first major outbreak in 2006			0
@entity197 had an outbreak in 2008			0
@entity200 ' well - developed immune systems usually can fend off the virus , but children are vulnerable to it , according to the @entity194			0
" it looks like ( @entity160 ) has emerged strongly , probably because it had n't circulated with the same intensity in the past years , " @entity60 said			0
reported cases of streptococcus suis have risen significantly in recent years , notably in @entity208 , according to a paper that appeared last year in @entity210 , a journal published by the @entity194 in @entity212			1
the rainy season in @entity1 , which lasts from may to october , is a key problem in trying to control diseases like dengue			1
because of a lack of indoor plumbing in many homes , people collect rainwater in vats , creating potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes			0
in @entity1 , as with many places around the world , parents first try treating their child at home			2
if that does n't work , they typically then go to a local clinic			0
a hospital visit , which often involves a long trip , is a last resort			0
mystery illness claiming dozens of lives @entity2 's @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report .			0

doctors say the inappropriate use of steroids worsened many cases
