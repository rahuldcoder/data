-- " stop and smell the roses			1
" if you 're like me -- and the millions of other workaholics in @entity6 -- this line elicits an immediate eye roll and a visceral reaction of : " you have got to be kidding me			0
how can i stop and smell the roses with all the work i need to get done ? ! " what can i say ? i work a lot and i enjoy it			1
i barely stop working on vacations			2
my body may be sitting on a beautiful beach , but my mind will still be racing ahead planning my next work - related move like i 'm a player in the career version of , " @entity18			1
" but then i read an article a few months ago that had a profound impact on me			0
this article shared the observations of a nurse who had cared for dying patients on their deathbed			1
she documented their regrets as they reflected upon their lives and their impending demise			0
did these people -- faced with their own mortality -- express their disappointment over not putting in more hours at work ? did they lament over work - related e-mails they wished they had answered or express remorse over business meetings they missed attending ? nope			1
in fact , she found the opposite			0
the @entity45 most common regret expressed to the nurse -- and the number one regret of men under her care -- was : " i wish i had n't worked so hard			1
" as the nurse noted , " this came from every male patient that i nursed			2
they missed their children 's youth and their partner 's companionship			2
" the nurse also shared the other common regrets articulated by her patients , such as their disappointment in not pursing their dreams , failing to have the courage to express their true feelings and not allowing themselves to be happy			2
but of all of these , the one that struck me the deepest was : " i wish i had n't worked so hard			1
" i thought about this for a while , letting this deathbed regret percolate in my mind			2
my wiring is to work all the time -- partly because i actually enjoy it ( or at least i believe i do ) and partly because i inherited my @entity80 father 's immigrant work ethic			1
( which is tempered slightly by my mother 's @entity83 culture that emphasizes enjoying life			0
) i wondered if it would be possible for me to truly " stop and smell the roses " ? after a great deal of introspection , i came to this candid conclusion : no , i could n't -- and i doubt others like me could either			1
but i do believe that i 'm capable of " slowing down and smelling a rose or two			0
" so this summer , i have decided to carve out moments from my work in the areas of standup comedy , writing and producing to relax a bit -- maybe even have some semblance of a social life			0
for those not swayed yet to join my " smell a rose or two this summer " campaign , you should be aware that there are actual tangible benefits to giving yourself some down time			1
as the @entity108 notes , simple relaxation can reduce stress and improve your health			0
take a yoga class , meditate or learn muscle relaxation techniques that literally only take a few minutes a day to perform -- these all help reduce stress			0
and for those who will only consider relaxing more because it means you will be better at your job , you are in luck			0
a study in the @entity119 found that people who worked 35 to 40 hours per week , as opposed to 55 - plus hours , were better at problem - solving and had better short - term memory			0
bottom line : lowering hours worked per week can make you more productive			2
but wait , there 's more : a 2012 study , which examined the actual benefits of " stopping to smell the roses , " found that people who appreciated the blessings in their lives tended to be happier			1
thus , appreciating the " roses " in your life -- be they relationships , family , or even the beauty of nature -- will likely lift your spirits and increase your happiness			0
the summer of 2013 officially begins this week			0
what 's going to be for you this summer ? more work , more e-mails , more meetings ? or will it be a summer where you allow yourself to slow down a bit -- just a bit -- to have some fun , to relax and to appreciate the nice things in your life ? i think it 's best put by a famous line from the movie , " @entity153 " : " do you want to take a leap of faith , or become an old man [ or old woman ] , filled with regret , waiting to die alone ? " i have made my choice			1
what about you ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

a nurse said that the number one regret of dying men is that they wished they worked less
@entity164 : i 'm a workaholic , but i was profoundly affected by the dying men 's remorse
he says he really enjoys work and ca n't stop to smell the roses , but he will try to slow down
@entity164 : relaxing has health benefits and can make you happier , so go for it if you can
