bestselling author @entity0 might be best known for his character detective @entity2			1
but his second - most - popular character is no slouch either			0
@entity0 's books have sold more than 50 million copies around the world , most of them featuring the fictional @entity2 of the @entity10			1
but in 2005 , @entity0 moved away from his popular police procedurals to try his hand at a legal thriller			1
the result was " @entity15 " with @entity16 , a criminal defense attorney who works out of the back seat of his @entity18			1
the book was a hit and later became a critically acclaimed movie starring @entity22			2
now @entity16 returns in " @entity23 , " @entity0 's fifth novel featuring the fast - talking defender			1
in the book , @entity16 takes on a murder case where the victim happens to be one of his former clients			1
while @entity16 is often a shark in court , his personal life is a shambles			1
he 's nearly broke and alone , estranged from his ex-wife and teenage daughter and desperate to reestablish ties			2
meantime , @entity0 has not forgotten fan favorite @entity37 , who makes a brief cameo in " @entity23			1
" @entity37 is also featured in a new ebook short called " @entity42 , " and coming in january , to tv			0
@entity0 has co-written a pilot for @entity45 for an hourlong show , " @entity37 , " which will air exclusively on prime instant video in 2014			1
it stars @entity49 , who has appeared in " @entity50 , " " @entity51 " and " @entity52			0
" fast facts age : 57 hometown : born in @entity55 , now lives in @entity56			0
former profession : crime reporter for the @entity59 for fans of : crime novels , legal thrillers , @entity63 , @entity64 fun facts : @entity0 has appeared on several episodes of the @entity67 show " @entity68 " as himself			1
he is also a longtime fan of the @entity69 and threw the first pitch at one of their games in august			0
five questions for @entity0 @entity75 : tell me about the title of your new book			1
who are " @entity23 ? " @entity0 : the easy explanation is the " @entity84 " are the jury in the trial			1
i overheard the reference hanging around with some lawyers who help me with my @entity16 books			1
it was kind of an offhanded reference and , as often happens when you 're hanging around with cops and lawyers , they 'll tell you the greatest stuff and they do n't know how good it is			0
i knew it would be my title immediately , not only because it 's a cool phrase but also because it had other meanings , because this book has a lot to do with @entity16 's character , his dealing with guilt over things he 's done , professionally and personally			1
obviously i want this book to be a legal thriller and courtroom drama , but also it 's a meditation on personal guilt and how you deal with it			2
this idea that everybody has a jury inside , their conscience that dictates the verdict on the things that they do			0
@entity75 : how has @entity16 changed over the course of your series ? @entity0 : i do n't know if this is the lowest we 've ever seen @entity16 , but in this book his professional and personal choices have left him pretty much alone and away from the people he longs for the most , most notably his teenage daughter			1
in this book , we never actually see her up close and in person			2
@entity16 has to watch her from afar			2
that relationship , which has certainly anchored him in other books , has been torn asunder by something he did			0
he actually did his job correctly , and yet it had an effect where people later got hurt and that alienated his ex-wife and his daughter from him			0
so this story is about him trying to redeem himself in their eyes			0
as a criminal defense attorney , @entity16 does something for a living that his daughter has decided is abhorrent , so it 's a hard situation to be in			1
that 's where the " @entity84 " come in			2
it 's about @entity16 trying to convince a jury of his innocence , that 's the underpinnings of the story and that 's before we even get to the legal case that he 's handling throughout this book			1
@entity75 : you 're headed to @entity158 for a promotional tour			0
do you see any difference between your fans overseas and your @entity163 fans ? @entity0 : i would say @entity2 translates around the world pretty easily			1
a homicide detective is a homicide detective is a homicide detective			0
obviously procedures might be different from place to place , but the bottom line is that kind of character is the same in every country			0
when you write legal thrillers or you write about a lawyer , the procedure ... is different in every country			2
so @entity16 does n't translate as well in other countries , i 'm not just talking about language translation			2
i like the idea of going over and being able to help translate him or explain him to readers because i really feel that readers in other countries are risking more to read a @entity16 book than a @entity2 book			1
i 'll be in @entity189 and @entity190 and their legal systems are quite different so reading this trial that takes place in " @entity84 , " it 's really kind of an alien world			2
i appreciate every reader i have of a @entity16 book in these countries , and if there 's a way i can go over there and help explain , i want to do it			1
@entity75 : tell me how you finally brought " @entity37 " to tv			0
@entity0 : @entity2 was on the shelf for a long time , legally			1
i could n't do anything with him for almost 15 years because of deals i made in the 1990s			0
when i finally got the rights back , i did n't need the money			0
i did n't need anything from @entity209 , so i just had this resolve that i 'm either going to be able to control this or i 'm not going to do it , because @entity2 is too precious to me			2
on one hand , i 'm just as much influenced by great movies and great tv as i am by great novels , so it 's just instinctive that i want to try and do this and do it right			0
slowly over the last couple of years , i put together the show runner , the chief writer , our producer , and while i was doing that , @entity45 came to me because they heard about the project and saw the synergy between selling my books and wanting to get into the business of creating television and film			2
it was one of those common sense things , kind of a no - brainer			0
if it 's great or bad it 's going to be my doing and i 'm happy to make that gamble			0
i think it 's going to be on the good side , it 's going to be very representative of the books and my kind of creativity and i think it 's going to be something i 'm really proud of			0
@entity75 : what 's next ? @entity0 : before we started filming " @entity37 , " i was working on a new @entity2 book			1
i do n't have a title yet , but in it , @entity2 's got a new partner			1
he 's in his final couple of years of being a detective and i think he 's trying to be a mentor more than he has in the past			0
usually he kept his partners distant and dispensable			0
now @entity2 's paired with a partner who he thinks may be the real deal and could be a person on a mission like he has been all his professional life			1
so he wants to pass something on			0
geographically , this case takes him into a new part of @entity264 ; the investigation is primarily centered in @entity266 , so there will be a lot of new stuff , but at the same time , very familiar			2
it should be coming out this time next year and hopefully will coincide with the tv show .			0
