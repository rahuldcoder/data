-- @entity2 's prime minister @entity1 is facing a local election this weekend , the biggest test of his popularity since becoming prime minister in 2003			1
the polls are seen as a referendum on his popularity before the country 's first direct presidential election this summer , in which @entity1 is widely expected to run			2
but things do n't seem to be going smoothly			0
just months after the damaging @entity15 protests in @entity16 , @entity1 's government is now facing a wide - ranging anti-corruption probe			0
and to add to the misery , @entity2 's economy , once hailed as a miracle , is slowing down , its currency is hovering around record lows against the dollar , and some of its firms are facing huge foreign debts			1
how did it get into this mess ? many developed countries struggled with growth in the aftermath of the global financial crisis			0
not so @entity2 , which grew substantially over the last decade			2
@entity1 's government was praised for its ability to attract foreign investors from @entity34 and emerging markets such as @entity36 and @entity37			2
the rapid economic growth was largely fueled by cheap credit pouring into the country			0
as the crisis hit developed economies , investors turned to emerging markets which promised higher returns than depressed @entity46 markets			0
for years , @entity2 had enjoyed a foreign - funded construction boom			2
@entity49 prices had soared more than 50 % since the end of 2009 and both the country 's gdp and per capita income had increased threefold since 2003			2
but the party ended with the @entity55 announcing a scale - back in its stimulus program last summer			0
suddenly , there was less cash available to invest			0
with more security in the @entity63 economy , investors started pulling their money from the emerging markets			0
@entity2 's growth slowed to just above 2 % and inflation rose to 7.4 % in 2013 , well above the 5 % target			1
the country 's currency , the @entity71 , slumped further in january , which forced @entity2 's central bank to adopt a radical approach and almost double interest rates from 7.7 % to 12 % -- a clear indication of the bank 's determination to prevent foreign capital outflows			1
but for voters , this may not be good news			0
higher interest rates are likely to slow down @entity2 's economic growth			1
and as cash becomes less available and borrowing becomes more expensive , producers and business owners are likely to pass their increased costs to consumers , who will in turn see prices going up			0
@entity1 is aware of this and strongly opposed the bank 's move to raise interest rates			1
he argued it would hurt @entity2 's growth and blamed the @entity100 's recent tumble on the opposition and an " interest rates lobby , " saying it was the result of a conspiracy against him and his government			1
and while @entity2 's $ 800 billion economy remains among the 20 biggest in the world , the @entity107 has warned it is not built on a sustainable model and remains too vulnerable to dangers outside its borders			1
add to this another grim statistic : the country 's poverty			2
according to the @entity118 ( @entity118 ) , one in five @entity2 live below the relative poverty line -- meaning their income is less than half of the country 's median			1
that is one of the highest figures among developed countries , with only @entity128 and @entity129 lagging behind			0
@entity2 's strategic position means the country is the bridge between @entity133 and @entity34			1
its membership of @entity135 and candidacy to join the @entity137 reflect its importance			0
but the current unrest and uncertainty has already cost the country millions -- its stock market lost a third of its value last year alone			0
foreign investors have been watching @entity1 's steps closely and to them , the result of this weekend 's local election could be an indication of where the country 's economy moves next			1

@entity2 's economy , once hailed as a miracle , is slowing down and its currency is *talking* a beating
the country 's central bank doubled the interest rates to prevent foreign capital outflows
the @entity107 has warned @entity2 economy is not sustainable and remains vulnerable to external dangers
