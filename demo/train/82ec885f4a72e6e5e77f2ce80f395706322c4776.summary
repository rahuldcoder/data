@entity2 following the brutal killing of @entity5 in august 2014 , the masked face of " @entity1 " first gained prominence across our tv screens , newspapers , and social media feeds			1
since then , as a direct consequence of the copious media attention dedicated to @entity1 , the image of the masked figure has become ubiquitous and inescapable , allowing for a potent propaganda tool for @entity16 , also known as @entity17			1
he was on thursday unmasked as @entity19 , a @entity20 - born 27 - year - old from west @entity2 , first in the @entity21 and later confirmed by two @entity23 officials and two @entity23 congressional sources briefed on the matter			0
it is important to understand what the desired effect of the " @entity1 " brand is -- a marketing tool that uses fear to promote a hateful ideology			1
therefore , although the media has an obligation to report on issues around the world , as consumers of information , we must ensure we do n't allow @entity16 propaganda to achieve its desired effect			1
what likely began as a crude anonymizing tool to help partially conceal the identity of the killer , has now become a deliberate tool to help further the cause of @entity16 's state - building exercise			1
this is a tool that is specifically targeted at the @entity51 , and particularly the @entity52 , seeking to instil fear by forcing us to ask questions which play to our security concerns			1
it is difficult for me to imagine how a young man with a @entity2 accent would not only be able to kill innocent individuals , but to do so in the brutal manner in which he has			0
how is it that a man , who could have quite easily been walking among us every day , was able to kill a generous kind - hearted man such as @entity67 in cold blood ? now that the identity of " @entity1 " is known to be @entity19 , it is vitally important that we ensure that we do n't allow the brand to achieve its objective -- to instil fear within @entity76 audiences , advancing @entity16 propaganda , and dulling civil society 's willingness to challenge extremism out of fear			1
one way in which we can do this is to counter the desired dehumanized and threatening perception of @entity85 , and acknowledge why this plays into the hands of @entity88			2
we must also begin to challenge the root cause of @entity16 violence -- the @entity92 - jihadi ideology which underpins it , and the entire @entity94 spectrum which legitimizes this murderous fringe			1
how can it be that an affluent west @entity2 @entity20 has so much in common with three teenage girls from @entity99 ? the reason both of these seemingly disparate groups of have traveled to either commit atrocities , or play a role in @entity16 's state - building exercise , is that they all shared the ideology that underpins the actions of jihadist groups			2
it is no surprise that the @entity85 is from an affluent family			0
nor is it shocking to hear that he is well educated			0
over the last 20 years , there have been countless cases of members of the @entity92 jihadist movement who have been affluent , educated or both			0
@entity119 was university educated and his family were billionaires			0
@entity123 , the current head of the @entity125 , was a surgeon who had a degree in medicine from the @entity128			0
this characteristic is n't only shared by top - ranking officials within jihadist organizations , but is common amongst those leaving from the @entity52 who seek to fulfil lesser roles within the new so - called " @entity17			2
" the three girls from @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 , were grade - a students set for high academic achievement , according to their family and peers			0
also worth understanding and unpicking is @entity2 's status as a net exporter of extremism			2
last week the focus was east @entity2 , where the three teenagers from @entity99 were tempted by @entity16 , and west @entity2 now , as it emerged that @entity19 had lived in @entity150			0
it seems that " @entity152 , " as the @entity154 government affectionately called our capital in the 1990s , has become a microcosm of the @entity52 experience with extremism , and has fallen foul of failed attempts to tackle this			2
by focusing only on the role of law enforcement officials , and by exclusively dealing with extremism once it has become a terrorist act , we are consistently one step behind , and the terrorist intention achieves almost as much as the terrorist act as regards public opinion anyway			0
instead we need a civil society response that challenges extremism of all kinds as a social ill , comparable to racism or homophobia			1
@entity2 leading the @entity52 in this shift can not come soon enough			0
now that the identity of " @entity1 " is known , it is more important than ever to ensure we do n't simply destroy the brand , but also dismantle the marketing strategy , and dispute the ideology .			1

@entity183 : desired effect of " @entity1 " brand is -- a marketing tool that uses fear to promote a hateful ideology
important we ensure we do n't allow brand to achieve objective -- to instil fear within @entity76 audience , he says
we need civil society response that challenges extremism of all kinds as social ill , comparable to racism or homophobia , @entity183 says
