-- in summer 2010 , @entity3 graduate and football star @entity1 began a grueling 2,170 - mile drive from @entity5 , @entity6 , for a collegiate tryout in @entity8 , @entity9			2
it was the farthest from home he had ever been			2
his goal was a chance to continue his athletic success			2
four days later , he arrived in @entity9 , exhausted			2
an hour after that , @entity1 was trying out for the @entity18 squad , sprinting for fitness tests in the sweltering @entity9 summer heat			0
gasping for air and dripping with sweat , @entity1 could n't be happier			0
" when you 're running those sprints , lifting those weights and running up hills , it sucks at the time , " he said			0
" but right when you 're done , everyone is out of breath and looking all around , it 's like ' yes , it was worth it			0
' " a football running back known for scoring three touchdowns in a game , @entity1 discovered rugby in high school as a way to condition			1
rather than rely on the controlling coaching aspect of football , rugby allowed @entity1 and his teammates to run the plays and run the game			1
the sport became his passion , so he put his football days behind him and looked for a college rugby program			1
now a sophomore at @entity55 in @entity8 , @entity1 plays for one of the top varsity rugby teams in the @entity58 but for most colleges , rugby is considered at best a second - grade niche sport			1
seventy - five miles to the east in @entity62 , @entity9 , a true portrait of collegiate rugby versus collegiate football unfolds			1
unlike the @entity9 football team , with its sold - out stadium of more than 92,000 fans any given fall saturday , @entity65 barely has 100 fans , although both teams collide with well - known @entity72 rival schools			1
" what happens is , the footprint of collegiate football in the @entity75 is monstrous			0
it takes the air out of the room , " @entity78 head rugby coach @entity77 said			1
" playing rugby is akin to a communist activity			1
" yet behind the scenes , rugby serves an @entity58 passion for a worldwide sport			1
finding a field it 's the simple act of stumbling upon a practice , catching a rare match on tv or tossing a rugby ball around that draws people away from the ingrained mentality of @entity97			1
universities with big football traditions often offer rugby , but football 's domination can make it hard for " ruggers			1
" they set up at recreational sport fairs , speak at student group meetings and recruit from high school tournaments , but they can offer only rudimentary benefits			1
in the place of customized scooters , @entity112 team wear and logo - embossed gear , rugby players say they discover lasting friendships , passionate competition and the dynamics of a heavily skill - based game with a lifelong , global network			1
the recruits will have to pay for dues , travel expenses and jerseys , and they must practice three to five days a week			0
but first , they have to find a field			1
although some of the big colleges like @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 have fields designated for club rugby , the @entity65 team classifies itself as a " stepchild			1
" " historically , rugby players have been ' field gypsies , ' " said @entity137 , president of the @entity138			1
@entity9 senior and criminal justice major @entity141 knows the struggles firsthand			0
one thursday when he was 19 , @entity141 stepped on a rugby pitch for the first time			1
that saturday , he played in his first match but had no idea what he was doing			0
" two weeks later , i do n't know what it was , but right before the @entity153 , something clicked , and everything made sense , " he said			0
although @entity141 had never played a team sport before , the camaraderie aspect drew him in immediately			1
" it 's driven to not just be a team on the field but off the field that i really like , " @entity141 said			1
" we do everything as a team			0
" from field setup to team dinners , it 's not hard to spot the @entity65 ruggers on campus			1
on a wednesday night downtown , people sometimes ask what they 're celebrating			0
the teammates respond that it 's wednesday , and they 're just hanging out , as usual			0
@entity176 , a 20 - year - old sophomore from @entity177 , @entity178 , was offered a walk - on spot on @entity65 's track and field team			1
running is in his genes , but @entity176 turned down the opportunity and pursued rugby instead			1
" @entity65 had the better social environment , " @entity176 said			0
" it was the best decision ever			0
" anatomy of a team collegiate rugby teams often comprise powerful athletes , football and basketball players who entertained rugby as a third sport in high school			1
the athletes require " a real melting pot of skills and a portfolio of body types , " @entity77 said			0
from towering players built like oak trees to shorter , nimble sprinters , physicality is expected			1
each one has the chance to sprint , pass and tackle , and a successful tackle wo n't stop the action			0
there is no quarterback or wide receiver			0
" unlike football , we do n't want guys to travel for a weekend just to sit on the sidelines , " said @entity212 , a rugby coach at @entity213 with no pads or helmets to cushion the rough blows , players also have to learn how to use their bodies without causing serious injury			1
few timeouts , limited substitutions and the possibility of five or six matches in a single tournament force them to be in top form			0
it is a rapid , bruising contest that crashes muscle against muscle and challenges mental and physical technique over pure power			1
" i love football , so i went out to play rugby in college , and it was a big change , but it was addictive , " said @entity235 , a @entity65 senior			2
" i like the challenge of it			0
in football , you get the ball , and people can block for you			0
in rugby , it 's you against seven or 15 other guys			2
you 've really got to think and be smart with the ball			0
" @entity250 graduated from high school as a three - sport , @entity253 athlete			2
a natural , he excelled at basketball , water polo and swimming			0
in june , the recent @entity259 graduate helped the national rugby team , the @entity260 , defeat @entity261 for the @entity262 , an annual rugby union tournament leading up to the @entity263			2
@entity250 discovered rugby in college under the tutelage of @entity58 rugby legend @entity77 , head coach of the @entity267			1
@entity77 has had to fight hard to preserve the rugby tradition but says it is often one of the five most - attended sports out of 29 at the university			2
" what i know is that rugby positively changes lives			2
everyone that plays the sport is willing to pay it forward , " @entity77 said			2
" i had a player tell me after the season was over , ' coach , this was the hardest thing i 've ever done that i would n't trade for anything , ' and i said , ' well , that about sums it up , son			0
' " getting into the game collegiate club teams usually begin their season in the fall with a month of training to orient the " new guys , " whether it is freshmen or those new to rugby in general			1
one of the biggest challenges : teaching guys to pass the ball laterally or backwards , only , and still score			2
it creates a culture of teamwork -- " the most team - oriented team sport , " @entity141 said			2
" when you have to give up five days a week and some weekends when you 're traveling , it becomes a job , essentially , but a job that one loves , " @entity138 secretary @entity307 said			0
it showcases the volunteer nature of rugby : there are few paid positions related to the sport in the entire @entity58 @entity65 is a true battle on the field , from the bloodied players who forge on without stopping to the one missed tackle that can cost the game in a breathless contest			1
afterward , the home team hosts a social for the visiting team , no matter who wins			0
they even put up the out - of - town players in their homes			2
it is a game driven by respect , because each player knows what another has gone through to be on the field			1
" of course it sucks to lose , especially at home , " @entity141 said			0
" but point being , this is a tradition			0
you would never see that from football			0
" most ruggers say respect is one of their main reasons for playing the game			2
" there 's nothing like giving 80 minutes on a saturday to the game that you love , " @entity307 said			2
" you 're with 14 other guys in the arena against 15 guys that you 're trying to beat the hell out of			0
then afterwards , it 's being able to shake their hands and have a beer together			0
that 's the beauty of it			0

behind the scenes , rugby serves an @entity58 passion for a worldwide sport
rugby teams face challenges , from finding a field to *funding*
rugby players connect with the game and each other through powerful camaraderie
