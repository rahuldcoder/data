-- football is part of the lifeblood of the people of @entity5 , who have seen their heroes lift the @entity8 a record five times since 1958			1
from the legendary @entity11 , who inspired that initial success in @entity13 and also played in the 1962 and 1970 winning teams , through to the eras of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , ordinary @entity10 have delighted in their exploits			2
because @entity5 's " @entity20 " do n't just win , they win in style , capturing the imagination of a population often struggling with poverty and inequality			2
" i would say it is all about the joy football brings , " @entity27 's @entity10 star @entity26 told @entity0			1
" it 's about the children who maybe do n't have enough food at home , who do n't have a dad or a mum , but they go outside to play football even with bare feet and they feel joy and happiness to do it			2
it happened to me and many of my friends when we were growing up			0
" football helps a lot of people in @entity5			1
if you took football away from @entity10 , you would be affecting the nation 's heart			0
" a rocky road to @entity52 and the @entity53 ? that 's why it 's a matter of some national concern that @entity5 , a football - mad country with a seemingly neverending conveyor belt of talent , has never won the @entity60 tournament -- not with its men , or its also highly - talented women			1
and with @entity5 hosting the @entity53 , and the @entity60 two years after that , the pressure is on			1
the @entity65 provided the latest disappointments , with a men 's team sporting the likes of two - time world player of the year @entity18 and future @entity71 star @entity70 crashing out in the semifinals to @entity73 , losing 3 - 0 and ending up with the bronze medal			1
the women 's side , including five - time @entity77 , had to settle for silver for the second straight @entity60			1
work and play - @entity5 's samba star @entity79 has it all midfielder @entity26 , who played in the @entity73 match , admits that the failure hurt -- and not just because @entity5 's @entity83 archrivals went on to claim the gold medal for the second successive time			1
" we had hoped to win the gold medal because we had great players like @entity18 , @entity70 ... i was there , other stars as well , but we could n't do it , " he said			0
" to be honest it did n't hurt more to lose to @entity73			0
what hurt is that we lost the chance to win a gold medal that we could take home and show our family and our kids			0
that 's what hurt the most			0
we were sad , our families were sad			0
to me and the rest of the squad it was very sad			0
" @entity26 is unlikely to be part of @entity5 's bid for golden glory at @entity110 , having been left out of coach @entity112 ' provisional 52 - man squad			1
booming @entity5 lures immigrant workers it 's a powerful lineup which includes rising stars @entity79 and @entity116 , who both ply their trade for @entity118 in the @entity10 league but have been linked with several top @entity121 clubs			2
@entity18 , @entity123 defender @entity122 and @entity125 's @entity124 are among the more established stars hoping to be named as one of the three players aged over 23 who will be allowed in the final 18 - man squad			1
@entity26 knows the pressure of expectation on their shoulders , and what winning the tournament would mean to the players and his nation			1
" to win a football gold medal at the @entity60 for @entity5 would be like winning the @entity8 , " he said			1
" i am really hoping and praying that we can do it			0
" sugar seats ' at @entity5 's @entity53 ? @entity26 's @entity27 teammate @entity142 has also been picked , and will likely be battling @entity124 for the right - back berth			1
the 21 - year - old has a burning ambition to be part of @entity5 's first gold medal - winning team			1
" you ca n't even describe how much i want it -- i really want to play these @entity60 , i want to win them , " @entity142 told @entity0			1
" it will be an enormous pride to win this for @entity5			2
" his twin brother @entity153 , also part of @entity27 first - team squad , may have to wait to achieve his @entity60 dream after being left out of the provisional squad			1
" we started having this dream since we were about 10 years old , " @entity153 said , " because @entity5 never had won this medal and i would talk to my brother and say , ' it would be great for us to get that gold medal , that @entity5 never had			1
' " @entity8 beer battle about cash , not game this time the @entity60 tournament will be missing @entity73 , who failed to qualify , but @entity26 is warning against complacency			1
" of course @entity73 have great players and are a great team , but there are other teams we must worry about because at the @entity60 you never know what you are going to get since every nation wants to take home a medal			2
it 's a tough competition , a great competition , " he said			0
@entity153 agreed : " there are also strong sides coming from @entity183 and even the @entity185 team , they have good players and they have home advantage			0
" @entity142 chipped in : " imagine playing against @entity185 in the @entity188 ... imagine ... @entity190 ... semifinals ! " before the excitement of the @entity60 , @entity27 's @entity10 contingent have their parts to play in bringing a record - extending 20th @entity195 title to @entity190			1
@entity196 quits as @entity10 football chief neighbors @entity199 provide the main challenge , having headed the standings for much of the season until @entity27 took over at the top earlier this month			0
" @entity199 are now a real contender while we have had a history of success for many years , " said @entity26			2
" we have had a lot of injuries but now we have most people fit and when that is the case we are very hard to beat			0
" the top two meet at @entity199 's @entity213 on april 30 in what many believe will be the @entity216 title decider , but @entity142 believes the games before that showdown will be equally decisive			1
" we need to think about winning games that we have , particularly away from home			2
when it 's closer , we can start thinking about the game against them , which it will be a great match of course , " he said all three @entity10 are indebted to the guidance they have received from legendary @entity27 manager @entity227 in their time with the @entity229			0
" he 's a manager with a lot of experience and he passes on a little bit of everything he says , " was @entity153 's verdict			0
" he tries his best to be honest with the players			0
i think that 's really important , " said @entity142			2
@entity26 said that when the 70 - year - old finally decides to retire , it will leave a massive void			2
" when @entity227 leaves @entity27 , the club will miss him a lot			0
he is fundamental for this club			0
when he leaves , i am telling you , people will be so sad because he is special , he is different			0
his history of success shows that			0
