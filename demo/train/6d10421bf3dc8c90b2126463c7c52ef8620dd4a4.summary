police say he strikes in the early morning hours , often before the sun comes up , and his method is usually the same			1
while on foot , he approaches his female victims , many of them minors , as they walk alone to school or wait at a bus stop , and he strikes up a casual conversation with them			0
then he quickly brandishes a knife or gun and forces his victims to a secluded nearby area , where he sexually assaults them			0
and just like that he is gone			0
but he leaves behind his dna and -- for his victims -- the memory of a teardrop tattoo on his face			1
dubbed the " teardrop rapist , " the man is one of @entity20 ' most prolific criminals			1
since 1996 , police believe the same man assaulted girls and women 35 times throughout a broad swath of the city center			1
then in 2005 , he stopped			2
for seven years , the case went cold until november when , according to recent dna tests , the man attacked again			1
now , just seven months later , he has struck yet again making his capture a top priority for the @entity33 , which has launched a massive manhunt to end the assaults			2
read the police alert police deputy chief @entity37 has this warning for residents citywide : " for families that have teenage daughters walking we have had several occurrences where the victim has been as young as 14 , 15 years old			2
we are asking parents to ensure that their young teenage daughters are accompanied			0
" the attack that put this cold case back in the spotlight occurred at 5:30 a.m. in the morning hours last november when a 15 - year - old @entity51 was walking in a residential neighborhood			1
the suspect approached the victim by asking for directions , then pulled out a gun and forced her into a yard , where he sexually assaulted her			2
at the time , it was initially investigated as another sexual assault case			2
then , a couple of months later , the dna results matched 10 other sexual assaults that police have linked to the same man , known as the " teardrop rapist			1
" after investigating some leads , police decided last month to go public with the dna findings that showed the " teardrop rapist " had struck again after an apparent six - year hiatus			1
now , a task force of 20 police detectives is following new leads and resurrecting any clues from previous cases dating back to 1996			1
the latest assault attempt in the case was june 15 , police said			1
authorities plan to canvas @entity78 neighborhoods on thursday			1
the suspect has been described as a @entity78 male , 40 to 55 years old , with brown eyes and brown hair			1
his height ranges between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 6 inches tall , and his weight is believed to be 130 to 170 pounds			0
he has possible teardrop tattoos below one of his eyes and has been seen wearing a dark - hooded sweatshirt as well as a baseball cap or a dark - colored beanie on his head			2
detective @entity92 , who is leading the task force with fellow detective @entity94 , said the suspect often goes unnoticed in the neighborhoods where he has targeted his victims			1
" he can walk up to somebody and spark up a conversation , and the victim does n't feel threatened until the weapon is seen , " @entity92 said			0
" so he blends in , and nobody is saying , ' what is this guy doing in our neighborhood ? ' " the pattern of attacks shows the suspect never strikes in the same place twice , @entity92 said			2
" he 's just all over the place , and he appears to be familiar with the area -- whether he lives in the area , has family ( there ) or works in the area			2
" dna evidence has linked 11 of the 35 victims , who range in age from 14 to 41			0
the remaining 24 cases are tied together by the similarities in the attacks and descriptions of the suspect			2
the locations of the attacks are spread out in a wide area concentrated through the center of @entity20			1
map of " teardrop rapist " attacks ( @entity129 ) inside @entity20 police headquarters , the @entity131 resembles a command center for an emergency operation			1
on a wall there are poster boards with the latest leads written on them			0
detectives are busy combing through some 700 boxes of old and closed cases , visiting old locations and even re-interviewing victims to shake out any possible clues			0
@entity94 insists the task force will leave no stone unturned			0
" we have decided to completely re-investigate it from the beginning , going through all of the original cases , all of the original follow - up investigations that were done , " she said			0
the detectives have already uncovered a previous composite sketches by going through some old cases			0
all 11 sketches depict the teardrop rapist through the years , but some are very dissimilar : in some sketches , he has a teardrop tattoo on the left side of his face , while it 's on the right side in others ; some sketches have two teardrops , and others have none at all			1
police admit the wide variation of composite sketches can be confusing but said at this point they can not narrow a sketch down to just one			2
the detectives stressed the sketches are simply a guide and another tool to help make the community aware , with the hope that they might lead to someone recognizing the suspect			0
@entity94 said these attacks " happen very quickly , " explaining the different descriptions of a suspect who police believe is the same man			1
" there is a knife involved , there is a gun involved ; every person focuses on something different , " she said			0
despite the massive police investigation , @entity92 said he believes ordinary citizens will help crack the case			1
" it 's gon na be that one little thing where someone says , ' it looks like that guy i used to work with , ' " @entity92 said			0
to get the public 's attention , @entity20 police are sending out community alerts with a description and composite sketches of the suspect , and the city has offered a $ 50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest			1
@entity94 said she wo n't be able to rest until police get their man			0
" we will figure out who this is ; we will arrest him , and we will make sure he gets prosecuted , and we will do the best that we can to make sure he does n't victimize any women again			0
" for @entity92 , the case hits close to home			0
" i 'm a parent , i have a daughter ; my thing is it 's happened here , and it could happen where i live , " he said			0
" so our job is to find this individual no matter what it takes			0
