-- nervy , unconvincing and fortuitous -- but @entity2 could scarcely care less			1
on a night where its players finally stepped into the high - pressure cauldron atmosphere of the @entity6 on home soil , @entity2 found a way to win			1
gone are the days of " @entity10 " or " @entity11 " -- the beautiful game -- this current generation can not compete with that of 1970 or 1982			0
but it does possess its own heroes -- and when @entity2 needed him most , @entity17 , for so long the face of this @entity6 , stepped up and delivered			1
his two goals , the second a highly controversial penalty awarded in a farcical manner by referee @entity21 , ensured @entity2 triumphed 3 - 1 over @entity22 in thursday 's opening match			1
@entity25 's stoppage - time strike ensured a party atmosphere in @entity27 -- though it did not prevent protesters from assembling outside the stadium immediately after the contest			1
in a week where politics has overshadowed sport , this was the result the entire country had hoped for and rounded off a day which had begun in worrying fashion			0
earlier thursday , violence erupted in @entity27 as police clashed with protesters around 11 kilometers from the stadium			1
critics are furious with the @entity44 government for spending $ 11 billion on the @entity6 instead of low - income housing , hospitals and schools			1
inside the arena , the country 's president @entity48 was booed by the crowd despite her attempt to keep a low profile			0
but any frustration at the political problems which have overshadowed the lead - up to the tournament were temporarily placed on hold			2
as the @entity44 team lined up for the national anthem , those draped in yellow rose to salute not just their heroes -- but their entire homeland			0
this was not a simple song -- this was a war cry , a call to arms to relieve the pain and struggle of daily life , and the disaster of 1950			0
not since that year has @entity2 hosted the tournament			2
for 64 years the nation has waited to exorcize the demons of its darkest day in football			0
@entity2 , needing just a draw to win the tournament , led 1 - 0 at halftime against @entity81 and appeared destined for greatness			1
medals were engraved , newspapers were published at halftime declaring @entity2 champion of the world			2
it was set to be the biggest celebration the country had ever witnessed -- but nobody remembered to tell @entity81			0
@entity91 equalized to stun the home crowd as the visiting team began to sense fear inside the @entity95			0
and then , it happened -- the moment that brought about what would be known as @entity2 's " @entity100 " moment			1
@entity2 goalkeeper @entity101 allowed an effort from @entity103 to roll underneath his body and into the net -- @entity81 was crowned champion			2
for @entity101 , life would never be the same			0
even though he was named goalkeeper of the tournament he was scapegoated and never allowed to forget his error until he passed away in 2000			0
" under @entity44 law the maximum sentence is 30 years , " @entity101 remarked on his 79th birthday , just two weeks before he passed away			0
" but my imprisonment has been for 50 years			0
" @entity2 's players are no strangers to the history of their nation -- the yearning to erase the pain of 1950 has been with each and every generation who have pulled on the famous yellow jersey			1
so when @entity124 inadvertently diverted the ball into his own net after 11 minutes , you could have forgiven those draped in yellow for looking to the heavens			2
@entity22 , which finished third at the @entity129 , deserved the lead -- though it came in fortuitous circumstances after @entity133 's miscued effort was turned in by the @entity135 defender			1
buoyed by the goal , @entity22 appeared full of confidence and could have had a second when @entity133 peeled away at the far post only to send his header straight at @entity140			1
shocked and stunned by conceding , @entity2 slowly but surely wrestled its way back into the contest			2
and in @entity17 , the team has a player ready to carry the nation on his shoulders			2
so much pressure has been placed on the 22 - year - old , who endured a difficult first season at @entity152 club @entity151 , but this is the moment he has been waiting for			0
and when his country needed him , he responded			0
with 29 minutes played , @entity17 took advantage of the space in front of him before unleashing a low 25 - yard drive which flew into the corner			1
as the ball hit the back of the net it was as if a pressure valve had been released -- joy unconfined , thousands hugging , dancing , kissing and glancing skywards to offer prayers of gratitude			0
this was @entity2 , resplendent in its yellow and blue , pushing forward			2
and when it needed it most , it had the luck too			0
with 20 minutes of normal time remaining , referee @entity21 adjudged that @entity174 had fouled @entity175 and pointed to the penalty spot			0
it was a bewildering decision , with television pictures clearly showing that the @entity2 striker had fallen over and not been dragged down by @entity174			2
while the @entity181 players raged at the @entity183 official , @entity17 steadied himself and took the spot kick , only just beating @entity185 from 12 yards			2
" if that 's how we start the @entity6 , we 'd better give it up now and go home , " @entity22 coach @entity186 told reporters after the game			1
" we talk about respect , that was n't respect , @entity22 did n't get any			0
" if that 's a penalty , we do n't need to play football anymore			0
let 's play basketball instead , it 's a shame			0
" with @entity22 riled by the injustice , it attempted to respond almost immediately and @entity200 thought he had equalized only to be denied by the referee 's whistle			1
@entity204 's long - range drive then forced @entity2 goalkeeper @entity140 into a scramble as @entity22 pushed on in search of the goal to draw it level			1
but just as @entity2 appeared to be hanging on , a moment of magic from its most impressive player on the night , @entity25 , ensured victory			1
a sweeping counter-attack allowed the midfielder to run clear before toe - poking the ball past @entity185 to secure victory			0
@entity2 will face @entity216 in its next game on june 17 in @entity218			1
@entity216 begins its @entity220 campaign against @entity221 on friday , when there is a repeat of the 2010 @entity6 final in @entity225 with champion @entity226 taking on @entity228			1
friday 's final game sees @entity230 take on @entity231 .			1

@entity2 defeats @entity22 3 - 1 in thursday 's @entity6 opener
@entity124 own - goal gives @entity237 side an early lead in @entity27
@entity17 then scores twice for @entity2 and @entity25 seals win late
