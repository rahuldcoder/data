-- lawyers for @entity2 , the @entity3 man who was acquitted of second - degree murder in the killing of @entity6 , plan to ask the state to reimburse @entity2 for at least $ 200,000 of expenses incurred during his trial			1
under @entity3 law , an acquitted defendant can not be held liable for court costs or any charges while detained in custody , as long as a clerk or judge consents to the refund			1
the costs may include money spent for expert witnesses , travel expenses and fees for transcripts			1
" we 're probably going to ask for somewhere between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000 , " lead attorney @entity25 said			1
but , @entity25 said , the chances are slim they 'll receive anywhere near that sum			0
" we 're not going to get it			0
the case law here is quite limited			0
even though we 're going to ask for it , the amount that we 'd most likely get is significantly less			0
" such a request is fairly standard in the state			0
@entity37 , who was charged with murdering her 2 - year - old daughter , filed a similar request after her acquittal in a @entity3 courtroom in 2011			1
while the final accounting is still being tabulated ahead of the formal request , the highest expense in the @entity2 trial were the expert witnesses			1
" we had to bring in four to five experts on the voice issue			0
that was as much as $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 , " @entity25 said			0
transcripts ran approximately $ 20,000 , he said			2
however , under state law , any attorney 's fees would be exempt from such a refund			1
@entity25 estimated the fees he would ordinarily have charged run approximately $ 1 million -- fees that do n't include the amount that would have been charged by co-counsel @entity60 , nor others on the team that put together the successful defense			0
" i have n't gotten one penny in fees , " @entity25 said			0
" i do have an agreement with @entity2 that if he comes into money , i would get paid			2
" despite being currently unemployed , @entity2 could potentially get income through other sources such as writing a book , or any money resulting from a defamation lawsuit against @entity72 for airing an inaccurate editing of @entity2 's call to non-emergency dispatchers the night @entity6 was shot and killed on february 26 , 2012			1
in all , @entity25 estimated the total cost of defending @entity2 to be around $ 2 million			2
@entity2 pulled over in @entity77 for speeding , given warning @entity2 was acquitted by a six - person jury in july on second - degree murder and manslaughter charges			2
the high - profile case sparked a heated nationwide discussion of race as well as debate over @entity3 's " stand your ground " law			1
@entity6 was an unarmed black teenager , and @entity2 identifies himself as @entity89			2
@entity2 , a neighborhood watch captain , called police after spotting @entity6 walking through the neighborhood			2
he followed @entity6 , against the directions of a dispatcher , and argued that he shot the 17 - year - old after he and the teenager fought because he feared for his life			0
the prosecution said @entity2 profiled @entity6 because he was black , followed him and shot him during a confrontation			0
@entity98 : @entity2 visits @entity3 gunmaker @entity0 's @entity100 contributed to this report			1

@entity2 's lead attorney says they will request at least $ 200,000
