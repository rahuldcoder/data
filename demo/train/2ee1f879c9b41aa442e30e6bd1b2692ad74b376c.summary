-- walking a mile in someone else 's shoes might be challenging , but it 's probably not as emotionally taxing as spending every moment with that person for eight straight days			1
filmmaker @entity6 , 24 , discovered this when he set out to star in , direct and produce his latest project , @entity10 's " @entity9			1
" the docu - series follows @entity6 as he jumps from various people 's worlds : a rapper , a homeless girl , a cage fighter and others			1
this is n't the first time @entity6 has laced - up a pair of someone else 's shoes			1
at 19 , he spent the summer as a resident of an assisted living facility in @entity25			1
during his time at the facility , @entity6 starred in , directed and produced " @entity6 , @entity27 , " a feature film that @entity29 eventually bought the rights to and aired in 2008			1
" ' @entity31 ' was pretty much just humanizing senior citizens , " he told @entity0			1
" it was nothing more , nothing less			1
they 're just incredible character portraits of these people -- of these senior citizens that just had no voice , but had so many incredible things to say			1
" each episode of " @entity9 " could be compared to a shorter " @entity27 , " he said			1
" i feel like this show is that , but for my generation , " he said			1
" that 's what kind of makes it special for me			1
" @entity0 spoke with @entity6 about his show , which will premiere on monday at 10 p.m. , @entity48 , on @entity10			1
how has this experience affected your personal life ? well i do n't have one			1
how do you have these experiences and then go back to being @entity6 ? i do n't really			1
no one 's ever asked that before			1
it 's weird because every time i leave one of these worlds , i 'm back for like , a week , then we go and we shoot another one			1
and for that week that i 'm back , it 's kind of weird -- i almost feel like i am that person still			1
like , after we hung out with the poker player , i realized the week after i was kind of walking like he did			1
there was another cage fighter who just had a certain way of speaking and i kind of started to use a lot of the words he was using			1
... to be with someone for eight days , nonstop , and be trying to get who they are and what they stand for -- it 's really , really intense			1
if anything , it kind of screws with your head a little bit in that you 're speed living			1
do other people notice these changes ? no. it 's not that crazy			1
it 's not like i 'm a schizo or something			2
it 's just something i kind of notice myself			2
... i think anyone would do this if they spent eight days with somebody -- just start picking up some of the funnier words they 've been using , or if they walk a certain way or if they carry themselves a certain way			2
after i was with the rapper , i remember , for the next week i was cursing so much			2
i was like , " what am i doing ? " you get absorbed into that world			2
is one week enough time to spend in someone else 's shoes ? oh yeah			2
it 's interesting because it 's kind of almost like a science : the first two or three days , the subject is a little bit skeptical , a little bit apprehensive about really opening up			2
once they really get to know me and what , i think , myself and our team is really about , they kind of buy into it a little more			2
then , by day five or six , they 're really opening up			2
and then by seven or eight , you 've really gotten to know this person and , if you 're not friends with them for life , you definitely will have their number in your cell phone			2
how did you find each subject ? it 's really tough			2
that 's the hardest part because there 's so many unique young people out there that are doing incredible , incredible things			2
to narrow it down to 12 was really hard			2
we have a research team -- for instance , i 'll say , " we 're interested in doing a homeless kid , or we 're interested in following someone with autism or we 're interested in a cage fighter , " and then our research team will investigate those worlds and see who are the different characters out there that are interesting			0
the one thing we 're really , really , conscious of is trying to find people that do n't necessarily want to be on reality tv , or be on a tv show , i should say			0
what 's one an example of a great subject ? we went to an exceptional children 's school in @entity159 [ @entity160 ] and we just interviewed the 30 kids there			0
and there was this one kid who popped up from the interview that just had an incredible , incredible objective sense of what he had , which was autism			0
and he still had the ability to be really funny			0
you did n't feel bad for him			0
he kind of shed a new light on autism			0
you 're the star of " @entity9 " and you 're behind the scenes as well ? yeah			1
i consider myself more of a director than anything			1
i 'm directing the episodes , i 'm an @entity177 [ executive producer ] on the show			0
i 'm definitely involved in the editing process as much as i can be , when i 'm not actually on the road shooting			0
... if anything , it 's a bit odd to be in front of the camera			0
... i 'm almost in front of the camera by default , if anything			0
how important was it for you to have creative control ? any director would be crazy to say that 's not something they seek			1
i 've been in on all of the creative control and i really mean this ... [ @entity10 ] has really let me and my team execute our vision in terms of the show that we really want to put on screen			0
that 's something i was extremely conscious of going into the process			0
i want to be a filmmaker			0
i want to make movies down the road ... so , venturing into this sort of terrain , i was certainly apprehensive			0
i did n't want to be labeled as being in a reality show			0
not that there 's anything wrong with that , of course , but i just did n't want to take that career route			0
what 's one thing you 've taken away from this experience ? it 's incredible what 's at stake for each individual that we live with			0
the cage fighter that we followed , he was just this big bulky cage fighter and you thought he just beats people up for a living in a cage			0
but i think , really , we got to know him and he took us to his father 's grave site			0
his dad had been brutally murdered			0
he just started -- we had the cameras a little bit farther away so he was able to forget about them a little bit -- and he just started crying and talking to his dad			0
he just started to get really emotional and crying and opening up about what that was like			0
he said he feels like he 's fighting still for his dad and it reminds him of when he used to do karate with his father			0
it 's those sort of moments , where you realize , " geez , there 's so much as stake for this person			0
" i kind of find that in every experience .			0
