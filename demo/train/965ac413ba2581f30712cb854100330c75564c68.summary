-- president @entity1 was crying			1
not choked up , not somewhat emotional			2
it was a startling sight -- after years of watching the man known for his coolness under pressure , for his analytic detachment -- to see him suddenly wearing his heart on his rolled up sleeve			2
what happened ? what made the president â € ” " @entity1 , " " president @entity13 " -- suddenly crack ? it happened wednesday , the day after he won re-election , when he stood before the staff at his @entity19 campaign headquarters to thank them for the work that helped make his victory possible			1
" what you guys have done , " he said , " means that the work that i 'm doing is important			0
" his right index finger quickly wiped away tears as they streamed down his cheek			2
perhaps @entity1 felt emotionally overpowered by what awaits him even before he finishes his first term			1
the country is careering toward the " fiscal cliff , " which really is the wrong term			1
it 's more a fiscal suicide ( fiscacide ? ) if the government irresponsibly pushes the country into a self - inflicted recession , complete with a renewed rise in unemployment			1
without an agreement with @entity46 , @entity42 , including @entity1 supporters weeping with him in that room , will face higher taxes and across - the - board spending cuts			1
@entity49 : why voter suppression fueled black turnout there 's more to get choked up about on the fiscal front			1
even with an agreement , @entity1 will preside over higher taxes and spending cuts in months and years to come			1
maybe thoughts about the economy brought to mind the crisis in @entity60 , @entity42 's economic , political and diplomatic soul mate , where a fiscal crisis will not relent ; where protesters continue taking to the streets in @entity65 , @entity66 and elsewhere , and where @entity68 chief @entity67 just said there are few signs of recovery and there is not much more the bank can do to help @entity65			1
a @entity60 unraveling would be terrible news for @entity42			1
but that 's probably not what made him cry			2
maybe he was thinking about other matter beyond @entity42 shores , considering what awaits the people of @entity84 , particularly the women there , when @entity42 forces leave			0
maybe he was thinking about what to do in @entity88 , where the killing continues unabated and refugees are fleeing by the thousands			1
or was he thinking about the intensifying confrontation with @entity93 ? just last week , @entity93 fighter jets fired on an unarmed @entity42 drone flying over the @entity96			2
on monday , the head of the @entity99 's nuclear agency said @entity93 is not cooperating with an investigation on possible nuclear weapons work , after the agency reported " credible evidence " of @entity93 's efforts to build a " nuclear explosive device			1
" @entity106 : @entity1 's critics , repudiated at last maybe @entity1 was crying tears of joy			1
maybe he was crying because of what winning re-election means			2
maybe he was savoring the realization that election to a second term means the @entity42 people , however divided their vote , have given a seal of approval to his presidency ; that if he had lost this election , he might have gone down in history as a failed president , rejected by voters after they gave him that first chance to prove himself			0
perhaps it was the knowledge that he will have another four years to pursue his agenda ; or his new hope that this time around , there 's a chance , however faint , that @entity46 and @entity130 will find a way to work together			0
that would bring the entire country to tears			0
opinion : my generation showed up or maybe @entity1 worried about the perils of a second term , when other presidents have found the political landscape littered with scandals , often caused by overconfidence among their own staff , by entrenched officials spending too much time at their jobs , growing arrogant after getting used to power			2
it 's more likely , however , that he was moved precisely by what he was saying , by the thought that he was inspiring a new generation , that all the hard work was not in vain			0
that watching his eager , overjoyed supporters , he felt , as he told them , " that the work that i had done in running for office had come full circle , " and the weight of history , the knowledge that his impact will transcend him , gradually made its way from his mind to his heart			0
but no , i believe it was something else			0
i think @entity1 cried because he was exhausted , physically and emotionally , and that exhaustion broke through the emotional barriers he has built since he was a child			1
he gave us the clues to the origins of his coolness in the pages of his memoir " @entity177			0
" " people were satisfied so long as you were courteous and smiled and made no sudden moves , " he wrote			0
" they were more than satisfied ; they were relieved -- such a pleasant surprise to find a well - mannered young black man who did n't seem angry all the time			0
" @entity1 learned to keep calm ; to conceal his emotions			2
but four years in the @entity191 , months of presidential campaigning , the final stretch of competing in an election whose outcome was in doubt until the very end , it takes its toll			0
it caused a small shift in that thick earthen dam , a tiny leak			0
and that 's where the emotions trickled out			0
that 's where the sense of gratitude , the sense of history , the stress over what he has faced over half a decade -- as president and as a candidate the first time around -- finally broke through			1
and what we saw , after all that , was a brief , if startling display of presidential emotion			0
it was a rare display , but now @entity1 may not find it possible to completely rebuild that fractured dam			2
i expect the next four years we will see a more emotive president			0
now the secret of @entity1 's emotions may not remain hidden in the safety of the @entity228 , where only his family can see it			1
@entity1 's re-election allows him to show his human side with less trepidation			1
decades of self - control wo n't fade away			1
but the president has shown himself and the majority of voters said they liked what they saw			0
@entity1 will remain cool , but he will allow himself to become less emotionally detached			2
after all , even mr. @entity13 cried sometimes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			0

@entity243 : it was startling to see @entity1 get emotional in talk to campaign workers
she says there are many woes he faces : *looming* " fiscal cliff , " @entity93 , @entity88 , the @entity60 crisis
she says maybe tears of joy ? but no , it 's likely exhaustion finally broke through his facade
@entity261 : *brutal* re-election battle ended in victory ; it should let him ease that self - control
