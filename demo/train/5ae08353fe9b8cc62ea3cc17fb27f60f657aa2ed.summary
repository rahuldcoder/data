-- @entity2 's name may not immediately ring a bell to you , but you almost certainly know his voice			1
he 's acted in nearly 700 films and television shows			2
from @entity14 in " @entity10 " to @entity11 in " @entity12 " to the most recent " @entity13 " -- if it 's an animated show , there 's a very good chance you 'll hear @entity2 's work ( he also specializes in animals , like " @entity18 )			2
he can currently be heard reprising his memorable role as the evil @entity20 on " @entity21 , " with his old friend , @entity22 , who plays one of the most noble characters ever created , @entity25			2
@entity22 was also a mainstay of 1980s animation , in roles such as @entity28 in " @entity29			2
" @entity2 and @entity22 make their living as voice actors and it 's not easy to forget , as the pair of them often break into voices like @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , one of @entity2 's favorites			1
however , more and more a-list actors are joining the voice - over club over the last 20 years			1
it 's even gotten to the point where @entity46 , star of the " @entity48 " franchise , took the opportunity of presenting an animation @entity51 to quip about how " easy " it is to do voice work			1
@entity46 joked that all he had to do was say the lines , " and then they give me a million dollars			2
" ( no less than @entity56 took issue with that characterization			0
) voice actor @entity59 -- creator of " @entity60 , " " @entity61 " and " @entity62 " -- is enough of an a-lister to host both " @entity64 " and next year 's @entity51			1
so how has the world of voice acting changed since @entity2 and @entity22 's early days ( besides the fact that a show like " @entity67 and @entity68 , " their first job together , probably would n't get made today ) ? " the technology has changed a lot , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" you see the @entity77 animation is so pretty and you could do a lot more with it than our old flat animation which i still like , of course			0
watching those shows absolutely blows me away on an @entity86 screen			0
you see so much more detail			0
it gives the actor more opportunity to bend your voice and be more subtle			1
" @entity22 said , " the respect level ( for voice acting ) is climbing and climbing faster than it ever did before in the last few years			1
the studios are recognizing they do n't have to hire a big name actor			0
people do n't know the difference in most cases			0
they 're finding they can take a chance with talent and accomplish the same thing			0
" @entity2 also noted that the @entity104 has made a big difference , and made it easier for fans to follow particular voice actors			1
" in the old days doing the show , we never got one piece of fan mail , " he said			1
" we had no idea there was an audience out there			0
the only way to tell there was some interest was if we got picked up for another season -- oh , somebody liked us			0
" @entity122 became a voice actor in 1997 , just at the time when animation attracting a-listers was going strong			1
he 's best known for his work dubbing @entity129 anime like " @entity130 " and most recently @entity132 's " @entity131			1
" @entity132 is owned @entity0 's parent company			0
" voice actors have always been quite popular in @entity129 , but @entity136 culture is now becoming more aware of the artistic contribution of voice actors because of the swell in popularity of video games and animated films , " he said			1
" not only have both mediums been expanding their market penetration in @entity136 in recent years , but the maturity of the storytelling in each medium has grown as well , " @entity122 said			0
" this attracts an older audience that is more curious about the performers behind their favorite animation or video game character			0
it seems that as we see a convergence of film , animation and video games , @entity136 audiences will become more and more aware of the importance of voice acting			2
" @entity164 has a slightly different perspective			0
he got into voicing even more recently , in 2000 , and is mostly involved with the world of video game voice work , as well as anime			1
" i do n't know if voice acting is more respected , per se , but i do think it 's a higher profile pursuit than it was in decades past , " he said			2
" games progressing to the point where they can be fully voiced has opened a whole new sphere of awareness and fandom , and ever since the animated feature films got the idea to fill their casts with celebrities ( for better or for worse ) , they 've never looked back			0
" but he certainly agrees with @entity22 and @entity2 that online fandom for voice actors has been a game changer			1
" it 's amazing how completely some of the fans have sussed out our vocal fingerprint , so to speak			0
i 've had folks identify me based on nothing more than a roar			0

you may not recognize their faces , but some voice actors are working *steadily*
