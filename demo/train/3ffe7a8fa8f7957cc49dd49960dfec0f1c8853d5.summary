-- it 's easy to understand why comedians like @entity3 , @entity4 , and @entity5 have flirted with adapting @entity8 's 1939 @entity7 story about a timid man with a vibrant fantasy life			1
not only has @entity12 made it relatively simple to turn @entity14 's daydreams into @entity16 tapestries of digital eye candy , it 's also the kind of emotionally textured role that can be a springboard out of the banana - peel slapstick ghetto			0
@entity21 's no stranger to such clown - crying - on - the - inside gambits ( see : " @entity24 " and " @entity25 " )			1
but his new film , " @entity26 , " despite all of its visual razzle - dazzle , never locates the beating heart of its hero			1
@entity21 , who also directed , plays @entity14 as an absentminded , socially awkward nebbish who works in the photo department at @entity33			1
the irony , of course , is that even though he works at a place called life , he has n't lived			2
instead , he retreats into his head and imagines himself a dashing mountain climber or a hot - blooded @entity39			0
@entity21 and screenwriter @entity40 have given @entity8 's story a 21st - century twist by setting the film in our era of corporate downsizing			1
life is about to cease publishing , and for its final cover the editors have chosen a shot from their globe - trotting photojournalist star , @entity51 ( @entity52 )			0
then @entity14 misplaces the negative			0
and with the encouragement of a co-worker he 's sweet on ( @entity57 ) , he embarks on a quest to find @entity51 , leading him to @entity59 and the @entity60			0
as @entity21 's @entity14 crisscrosses the planet , he slowly transforms into the action hero he 's always been in his fantasies			2
while stunning sequences show him skate - boarding away from an erupting volcano and fighting off a great white shark , the character never becomes more than a fuzzy conceit			1
at the risk of psycho - analyzing a film that 's already too deep inside its own head , @entity21 seems to lack the confidence as a dramatic actor to fully commit to the emotional potential of his story			1
too often he aims at our funny bones when he should be targeting our heartstrings			0
in the end , @entity14 is a film about acting out our dreams			0
but @entity21 never quite shows us the soul of his dreamer			2
