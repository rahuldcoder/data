-- five more states reported widespread flu activity during the second week of january , according to the @entity3 , bringing the total to 40 states			1
only 10 states are not yet reporting widespread activity : @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
" widespread " means that more than 50 % of geographic regions in a state -- counties , for example -- are reporting flu activity			1
the designation addresses the spread of the flu , not its severity			2
however , the number of states experiencing a high proportion of outpatient visits to health care providers for flulike illnesses is 14 -- @entity8 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity14 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , and @entity45 -- down from 20 in the previous week			1
ten children died from complications of the flu last week , bringing the pediatric death total for the season to 20			1
the @entity3 does not have data on the number of adult flu deaths			2
experts estimate the number of flu - related deaths range from as low as 3,000 to as high as 49,000 people each year			2
typically , the flu season begins in the winter months and peaks in january or february , according to the @entity3			1
but it 's way too early to know if flu has peaked yet this year			1
" as typical of a flu season , some areas are being harder hit than other areas , " said @entity3 spokesman @entity62			0
@entity66 kills first person in @entity68 one of those areas is @entity69			0
dr. @entity70 , deputy director for @entity69 's @entity71 , said 45 people under the age of 65 have died during the 2013 - 2014 flu season , which began in september			1
this includes two deaths in children			0
" an additional 50 deaths are currently being investigated and are likely to be confirmed next week , " @entity70 said			0
he said that a year ago , only five deaths had been reported at this time ; there were only 106 flu deaths during the entire 2012 - 2013 flu season			2
" @entity84 is the predominant virus circulating , and we do know when @entity84 predominates , there appears to be more fatalities , " @entity70 said			1
" we seem to have a predominance of a more deadly strain			0
" @entity84 is the same virus that caused a pandemic in 2009 , dr. @entity92 , a medical officer in the @entity3 's flu division , has said			1
it was dubbed swine flu because it was being seen for the first time in humans			0
since then , " it 's established itself very nicely in the human population , " @entity92 said			0
@entity84 has been seen every season since 2009 in people and is no longer referred to as swine flu			1
the strain is so common that it was included in this year 's vaccination , he said			2
adult flu deaths are not required to be reported to the @entity3 , but the government agency must be notified of any flu deaths in children			2
however , after @entity84 first surfaced , @entity69 health officials determined this was not enough			2
@entity70 said the lesson learned then was that " we needed a better way to determine the impact [ of flu ] on the community			0
so we in @entity69 made the decision to make deaths due to influenza in individuals under 65 mandatory to report			0
" what consumers need to know is that it 's not too late to take steps to protect yourself from getting the flu , said dr. @entity126 , medical director for the @entity127			1
" people who are young and healthy should be aware that they may get the flu and it could be serious , " @entity126 said			1
one of the reasons people often say they do n't get the flu vaccine is because they do n't get sick			0
that excuse does n't hold up , she said			0
in addition to getting the vaccine , which can prevent flu -- or at least lessen symptoms , washing your hands frequently and staying home when you 're sick can help you get through the flu season			0
doctors recommend using antivirals within the first two days of experiencing any flulike symptoms			0
does cold weather cause colds ? @entity0 's @entity149 contributed to this story .			0
