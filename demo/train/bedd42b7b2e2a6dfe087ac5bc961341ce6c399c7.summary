this year , at the annual gargantuan gadget gathering known as @entity3 , the titans of technology stood on stage to deliver virtually the same message , one after the other : we have arrived at a turning point in human society -- one in which the world around us is so deeply embedded with intelligent electronic objects that we can essentially outsource huge aspects of our life to them ! personal fitness			1
and now that our devices are becoming interlinked as a vast always - on network , they do n't even need to be supervised anymore -- our stuff can handle all of these irritating tasks just by talking with each another			1
the buzzword for this idea is the " @entity28			1
" and if truth be told , the @entity28 ( as it 's been hastily acronymed ) sounds ... pretty cool ! appliance giant @entity30 shared its vision of a " better and more beautiful future " in which its @entity34 platform might allow your @entity30 smartwatch to understand that you 're sleeping restlessly , and instantly tell your @entity30 audio system to play soothing music , your @entity30 air conditioner to reduce the temperature , and your @entity30 air purifier and humidifier to pump some scented mist into the room			1
meanwhile , your @entity30 coffeemaker is grinding some fresh beans for next morning 's automatically brewed cup of joe , and your @entity30 smartphone is transmitting your daily schedule to your @entity30 - enabled car system , so you can be guided directly to your first appointment when you wake up in the morning			2
( all of which will give you more time to watch " @entity59 " on your @entity30 widescreen @entity56 television and play @entity57 on your @entity30 tablet , naturally			2
) but as you can tell , the problem with @entity28 is that it depends on your having the right things -- " smart , " " connected " things			1
and @entity30 and @entity64 and @entity65 and the other brands that paid millions to appear at @entity3 are n't exactly handing them out for free			2
a standard light bulb costs a dollar			2
but a @entity71 bulb , whose intensity and color you can adjust with your smartphone , costs $ 60			2
and that 's not even including the cost of a @entity77 ( $ 200 ) , which allows you to manage up to 50 @entity79 bulbs , or @entity80 ( $ 60 ) , which let you control your lights if your smartphone is n't handy			0
for home security , you might find an august @entity83 useful -- letting you deadbolt your door using a smartphone even when you 're far away from home			0
that 'll run you $ 250 ( though it comes in four colors , including @entity90 and @entity91 ! )			0
and if an intruder tries to come through a window , your smart @entity95 camera system can sound the alarm and send you a picture of the trespasser , at a price tag of $ 200 for every opening you want protected			1
the list of smart , connected things that manufacturers want you to add to your smart , connected life gets even more elaborate from there			0
if you 're constantly worrying about whether you have enough fuel to fire up the family gathering you 've been planning ( and who does n't ? ) , @entity106 will sell you a @entity111 enabled @entity112 gauge for just $ 50			0
after you eat , you can play in your pool ( with your comfort managed by @entity116 's @entity115 floating wi - fi enabled thermometer and uv sensor , $ 100 ) or take a nap on your $ 4999 self - adjusting , digitally enabled @entity120 from @entity121			0
do n't worry about having a few too many helpings			0
your @entity124 smart belt will automatically let itself out a few notches ( the maker is still figuring out what to charge for it , but says it 's a " luxe " product for " upscale " customers , so , expensive )			0
of course , you wo n't want to hit the hay without brushing your teeth first — and your @entity133 smart toothbrush will let you automatically track and share how well you polish your molars for just $ 99 to $ 200			0
that just covers the human members of your family , of course			0
we have n't even mentioned @entity3 's burgeoning array of products for the internet of pets — from the @entity145 wearable fitness tracker for dogs to the @entity147 smart connected feeder — or the @entity149 and the @entity151 intelligent plant pot. the bottom line is that it all sounds great , until you realize that unlike the infrastructure of the @entity28 , which was laid down by the @entity156 , major universities and cable and telecom companies , or of the wireless world , whose antennas are paid for by mobile operators , the bill for the @entity28 's infrastructure is coming out of your own wallet ( @entity165 has one that digitally stores up to 10,000 credit cards , syncs with your smartphone and unlocks with your fingerprint , for just $ 150 )			1
and the smarter and more connected your devices are ... the thinner that wallet is going to be			1
which means that when you look at your bank balance after splurging on the @entity28 , you might feel a bit like an @entity174 .			1

@entity176 : the buzzword in tech is " @entity28 , " where devices are interconnected
he says fall for the gadgets if you want , the price is just a thick wad of bills out of your wallet
