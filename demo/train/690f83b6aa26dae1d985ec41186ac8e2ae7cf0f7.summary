@entity2 , @entity3 new @entity1 defense secretary @entity0 said saturday that success is more important than timing in any attempt to retake @entity3 's second most populous city , @entity8 , from @entity10 militants			1
@entity0 spoke on his way to @entity12 , where he is meeting @entity12 leaders and @entity1 troops in his first week in the post , having taken over from @entity16			1
any operation to take @entity8 will be " @entity3 - led and @entity1 - supported , " he said			1
" it 's important that it be launched at a time when it can succeed and so i think the important thing is that it get done when it can be done successfully			0
even if i knew exactly when that was going to be , i would n't tell you , " he said			0
" of course , i 'm open			0
i 'm always open to advice from our military commanders about what the best way to achieve success is			2
" and that is a question that will come down the road but i think what 's important is that the campaign to retake @entity8 succeed and we 're committed to that success and not to a particular timetable			1
" months after most @entity3 troops dropped their weapons and ran for their lives in @entity8 , up to 25,000 are expected to head back there in april or may to try to retake the city , according to a @entity1 official			1
and @entity3 prime minister @entity42 told the @entity43 this week that while there 's still work to do , he is sure the @entity3 are going to retake the crucial northern city			2
" we are now planning an offensive on @entity8 in the coming few months , " the prime minister said			2
" we have to prepare for it carefully because the only choice we have in @entity8 ( is to win )			2
we have to win in @entity8 to keep ( @entity10 ) out			1
" @entity1 secretary of state @entity51 , speaking in @entity50 , said the international community was increasingly determined to act together against @entity10 and that progress would continue to be made			1
" we have the tools , we have the political will , we have the determination and we are making gains in @entity3			1
territory is increasingly beginning to come back into the hands of the @entity3 government			0
the @entity3 military is now beginning to stand up with greater capacity , " he said			1
despite @entity51 's vote of confidence , some doubt whether victory in @entity8 is possible			1
@entity8 has been a symbol of @entity3 military incompetence , given how troops and police ran from their posts as @entity10 militants arrived in june			1
since then , there has been the start of airstrikes by the @entity1 and international allies against @entity10			2
the @entity3 military has also had fresh training , some of it conducted by @entity1 and allied forces , to make it more effective			1
it has had some success in curbing the @entity10 onslaught , but not in taking back a lot of territory -- much less that as valued as @entity8			1
new footage released by @entity10 on friday gave another insight into the challenge facing the @entity3 army and its allies			1
the video , apparently of an attack early this month on an @entity3 military outpost near @entity94 , 100 miles north of @entity95 , showed dozens of seized @entity1 - made @entity97 assault rifles and piles of @entity99 , as well as armored personnel carriers and a humvee			1
all these are now in the hands of @entity10 militants who appear to have overrun the outpost , some 60 miles northwest of @entity95			2
the video also showed several dead @entity3 soldiers , with one of the bodies burning			2
@entity109 ( @entity109 ) said it had no confirmation of when and where the vehicles were seized or where the video was actually shot			0
although this latest incident was only small , @entity10 forces have steadily acquired large quantities of @entity1 weaponry as a result of seizing @entity3 army equipment provided by the @entity1 , particularly in @entity8			1
up until now , one of the biggest and most successful forces has been the @entity124 peshmerga that serve @entity3 's semiautonomous @entity124 government , often at odds with @entity95			0
on saturday , @entity124 fighters repelled a massive offensive by @entity10 in the town of @entity132 and gained full control of the area , the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) @entity127 told @entity4			0
at least 34 @entity10 militants were killed during the fighting			0
these @entity124 fighters will have a role , including around @entity8			0
in his @entity43 interview , @entity42 said that liaisons between @entity3 forces and the @entity123 " must be powerful and must be watertight " to defeat @entity10			2
according to the @entity109 official , who spoke to reporters thursday , @entity8 police and tribal forces would likely join @entity3 troops in the assault on the city			2
@entity123 would play a supporting role , not going into @entity8 but instead blocking off supply and escape routes north and west of the city			0
the hope is for an operation in april or may to avoid running into @entity155 ( mid-june through mid-july ) and @entity3 's summer heat , the @entity109 official said			0
a final decision has not yet been made , though			0
count @entity159 , a senior @entity123 commander , is among the skeptics that such a spring assault would work			0
" i do n't think it 's realistic , and i do n't have any idea about a plan , " @entity159 told @entity4 's @entity162			0
" and if it involves the @entity3 army only , it 's not going to work			0
the @entity3 army is not ready for the fight			0
" retired maj. gen. @entity169 told @entity4 he believed it had been a mistake to reveal the potential timing of the @entity8 operation and that it could put @entity1 forces at risk			2
" this is a terribly unfortunate lack of professionalism , in almost a relaxed approach towards a challenge that we have been trying to get our arms around for almost a year , " he said			0
if the @entity3 forces -- from five army brigades -- do the street - to - street fighting , theoretically they should significantly outnumber their @entity10 counterparts			1
right now , @entity10 has an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 fighters in @entity8 , the @entity1 official said , but more could join the fight if they take the threat of attack seriously			1
however , an additional challenge for the @entity193 - dominated @entity3 military and @entity123 is that they will be trying to take a majority @entity195 population city			1
even if the offensive succeeds , sectarian divisions could exacerbate an already complicated situation and make it hard for the @entity3 military to hold on to the city			1
the approximate time of the attack had previously been reported : a @entity109 official told @entity4 earlier this year that @entity3 forces could make their first move in april			0
@entity4 's @entity162 reported from @entity2 and @entity208 wrote from @entity50			0
@entity4 's @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
