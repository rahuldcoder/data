@entity0 -- here we go again			0
every time the @entity3 are on the verge of making the rest of the @entity6 take them seriously beyond just an occasional tease , along comes -- well , something			1
an arrest on the night before the @entity13			0
thousands of cheeseheads dominating the stands to turn the @entity16 into @entity17			0
so here we are now , with the @entity3 preparing during their 47th season to play hosts on sunday afternoon to the @entity21 in the @entity6 's divisional playoffs			1
there will be none of that past silliness this time for the @entity3			1
at least , that 's what those associated with the team keep saying , and why should n't we believe them ? history , for one			2
but there are so many signs that the @entity3 are in the midst of a renaissance with their personal @entity38 of owner @entity40 , general manager @entity41 , coach @entity42 and quarterback @entity43			1
they 've been together since 2008			0
they 've produced five consecutive winning seasons for a franchise that had n't managed two in a row before that			0
they 've accumulated one of the @entity6 's best records ( 56 - 24 ) during that stretch , and they 've been particularly dominant in the @entity16			1
they also entered the postseason with the best record in the @entity57 at 13 - 3 to earn home - field advantage along the way to the @entity13			0
that is , if they keep winning			0
only the prolific likes of @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and the @entity68 ( @entity69 and @entity70 ) have been as consistently impressive as @entity43 during the past five seasons			0
plus , @entity40 has given @entity41 enough financial freedom to acquire talent as he sees fits , and @entity42 has won enough in @entity0 to shatter the record for most victories by a @entity3 head coach			2
playoff weekend x-factors the results ? three previous trips to the playoffs for the @entity3 ' @entity38 , and three losses			1
even so , before usually gabby @entity3 wide receiver @entity85 decided to go silent this week with the media for one of the few times during his eight - year career , he told the @entity89 , " with the team that we have now , and all the guys that have been around each other , with ( @entity43 ) leading us as a group and knowing that everybody is on the same page , it 's going to be a different outcome			1
the @entity100 has heard this before			0
in 2008 , the @entity3 were picked to handle a rising but suspect @entity103 bunch on the road in @entity105			2
the @entity3 lost 30 - 24			2
two seasons later , those 2010 @entity3 resembled these current @entity3 by building a 13 - 3 record that led to home - field advantage throughout the @entity57 side of the playoffs			1
with all those cheeseheads screaming like crazy , and with @entity3 fans either silent or heading down the local highways by the end of the third quarter , the @entity112 smashed the @entity3 48 - 21			2
the @entity3 were just slight underdogs when they headed to @entity119 to face the @entity120			2
instead , with @entity43 and his offensive teammates vanishing for long stretches , the @entity3 made the oddsmakers look silly with a 24 - 2 loss			2
when you combine the @entity3 ' recent and past playoff struggles with a historically shaky fan base that has a tendency to come and go ( even during games ) and with the appearances of all those " somethings , " this has been one of the @entity6 's most jinxed franchises			1
" when you 're growing up here , you 're not conscious of that			0
you 're not even thinking of that , " said @entity137 , 45 , a former @entity6 wide receiver who played 13 seasons in the league , including a franchise - record - filled eight for his hometown @entity3 through 2001			1
" after my junior year in high school , i had a chance to watch them practice in training camp , and then go through their locker room			0
... " still , as has been the case for many around @entity0 , filled with transients and dominated by @entity155 college football fans , the @entity3 were n't @entity137 ' favorite team			1
@entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159			0
" that 's where all the big superstars were from , so you gravitated to them , but i did watch the @entity3 growing up , " said @entity137 , who particularly was fond of their teams during the late 1970s and early 1980s , which featured quarterback @entity163 and running back @entity164			1
" if you loved football , you loved players who played well , and they had guys on those teams who played very , very well			0
" thinking fan 's guide to the playoffs it 's just that , after a wretched start that lasted for more than a decade after the @entity3 ' debut in 1966 , the @entity179 era featured the first of many horrors to come for the franchise			1
there were those come - from - ahead ( and i mean way ahead ) playoff losses to the @entity157 in 1978 and 1980 , with relatively unknown quarterback @entity10 leading the way for @entity189			0
in both games , @entity10 kept finding his receiver , @entity11 , in the clutch			0
years after the @entity195 era , there was @entity196 , the only @entity197 in @entity3 history , leaving with his @entity200 act for @entity201 as a free agent			1
there was @entity204 , the @entity3 ' supposedly squeaky clean leader , going from saint to sinner on the day before the @entity13 in 1999			1
he was arrested and accused of propositioning a female cop in @entity207 for oral sex , and the @entity3 were flattened by the @entity209 in the game			1
remember the @entity3 ' 2007 season ? they wish to forget			0
that 's when the @entity3 spent most of their time discussing @entity215 's ( ahem ) hobby with pit bulls instead of his ability to mesmerize opponents with his speed			1
that same year , @entity220 did n't even finish his first and only season as the @entity3 ' head coach			0
after a controversial 3 - 10 start , @entity220 bolted in the middle of the night with two games left to play to take over the @entity227 football team			0
now the @entity3 hope to get it right this time			2

the @entity3 host the @entity21 in the @entity6 's divisional playoffs sunday
the team has been *plagued* with woes since the @entity3 formed 47 years *ago*
player @entity204 propositioned a cop for sex the night before @entity238
quarterback @entity215 served time for running a dogfighting ring
