-- the scenes were shocking			0
hooliganism is supposed to be a thing of the past , but the fighting in the streets of @entity6 during the opening week of @entity7 was a stark reminder that football 's " disease " has not been cured			1
the first major tournament to be held in @entity12 has already provided a cocktail of color and a wealth of excitement on the pitch , but the violence between @entity19 and @entity20 fans has cast a shadow over the continent 's showcase event			1
despite being on a small scale so far , the problems have turned the spotlight towards 2018 -- when @entity19 will host the planet 's biggest soccer spectacle , the @entity30			1
" the @entity19 press are obviously very , very upset about what has happened , " @entity19 football expert @entity31 told @entity0			2
" how this will affect attitudes towards 2018 wo n't come from inside @entity19 , it 'll be a baton that is picked up by the international press and by @entity39 and international footballing authorities			1
" i think @entity19 will only react to criticism if it comes from outside			2
i do n't think @entity19 authorities have really taken the kind of steps that have been needed through pressure on a domestic front			2
" i 'd expect in the aftermath of what has happened that the @entity52 footballing authorities and perhaps even @entity50 will step in and mandate some kind of changes that need to be made in @entity19 football in order for 2018 to go ahead peacefully			1
" @entity57 , an expert on football hooliganism at @entity60 's @entity59 , believes @entity19 authorities need to take an initiative ahead of the @entity30			1
" they need to be able to identify who these groups are in each city because it is almost certain these groups will look to attack certain groups of fans that travel to @entity19 for the @entity30 in the same way the @entity20 hooligan groups have attacked @entity19 fans in @entity6 , " @entity57 told @entity0			1
" the important thing is that the police , between now and 2018 , are able to identify who these groups are and that they are closely monitored so they do n't cause trouble			0
" trouble also erupted at @entity19 's first match as the tournament kicked off last friday , when a black @entity80 player was allegedly subject to racist chants and four @entity20 stewards attacked in the stands			1
it is not the first time violence has tainted the @entity86			0
in 1980 , when @entity89 hosted the tournament , @entity60 's clash with @entity88 had to be halted due to fighting in the stands			0
in 1988 , police arrested @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity95 fans due to violence			2
and at @entity98 , nearly 1,000 @entity60 fans were arrested after riots in the @entity101 cities of @entity102 and @entity103			0
@entity52 soccer 's ruling body @entity39 has often been accused of failing to properly punish such problems , but this week it fined the @entity107 $ 149,000 and threatened its national team with a six - point deduction for the @entity111 qualifiers if there is any repeat			2
it may act again over tuesday 's street brawls , where police arrested 184 people -- 157 @entity20 and 24 @entity19 -- after a @entity19 national day march through @entity20 's capital sparked confrontations			1
@entity31 believes friday 's events should have proved a forewarning			0
" the violence was 100 % predictable , " he said			0
" you can talk about the immediate short - term context , which was thousands of @entity19 fans coming over to @entity20 and causing trouble in the stadium in @entity129 on friday in the match with the @entity80			1
" reaction to that in @entity20 has been pretty unequivocal ; a number of fan ultra groups vowed revenge immediately after friday and there was some anticipation that would be carried out before the @entity20 - @entity19 fixture			1
" the longer term context you can go back probably about a millennium and look at the relations between @entity20 and @entity19 , and it would n't be difficult to guess this is the sort of fixture that would bring those tensions to the boil			1
" given the complex historical context between the two nations , it was hardly surprising that their @entity151 clash was preceded by violence			0
their relationship has been punctuated by conflict , stretching back as far as the 11th century			0
most recently , @entity20 was occupied by @entity19 under @entity156 during @entity157 , in a brutal chapter that saw the @entity159 commit multiple numbers of atrocities			1
tuesday 's march , which marked the establishment of @entity19 sovereignty in the aftermath of the collapse of the @entity167 , was sanctioned by the @entity20 authorities			1
inside the stadium just before kickoff in tuesday 's game , @entity19 fans unfurled a huge banner that read " this is @entity19 " -- which some commentators claimed carried neo-nazi symbols on it			1
it depicted @entity178 , a @entity19 prince who led resistance to @entity20 - @entity181 rule in the 17th century			1
it provoked another familiar question when it comes to the issue of football in @entity19 : how easy is it to separate the soccer from the politics ? " it 's very hard and i 'd say that goes not just for international fixtures but also for @entity19 domestic football fan culture , " @entity31 said			2
" at your average @entity194 game the kind of slogans , iconography and symbolism such as flags , banners and chant that would n't have looked entirely out of place at a nationalist march outside football territory			0
" it 's very difficult sometimes to separate what you 're seeing as an expression of football culture and an expression of nationalistic culture			0
" but just as the authorities have done , @entity212 is keen to stress that the pockets of trouble witnessed in the tournament 's first week do not mean @entity39 was wrong to award the tournament to @entity20 and @entity218			2
" i actually think on whole , if you leave aside @entity151 fixtures , the experiences the vast majority fans have had in @entity20 and @entity218 have been extremely positive			2
this is about the behavior of the football fan and not the location in which they are behaving			0
" @entity20 police said their swift intervention when tuesday 's violence escalated prevented further casualties , and claimed fans carrying knuckledusters and batons were not interested in the football			1
the police also reiterated that over half a million people have so far attended matches , or fan zone areas , highlighting the small number of incidents leading to arrest			0
@entity20 's sports minister @entity243 said she was both " disgusted " and " ashamed " -- and vowed not to let a small minority spoil an atmosphere at the tournament she described as " fantastic			2
" despite the outrage , @entity57 agreed that the chaos in @entity6 was preventable			0
" i ca n't be 100 % sure as i was n't there but what happened in @entity6 seemed to be a complete mess , " he told @entity0			0
" historical tensions make it a high risk event			0
the bottom line is , we would n't have seen trouble had there not been between 10,000 and 20,000 @entity19 fans in @entity6			1
there were obviously things that went wrong on the day			0
" there was a situation where hooligans of both teams mixed in with other crowds , that meant normal fans got attacked and were subject to quite aggressive policing			0
that 's when we move from these small criminal groups fighting to wider disorder			0
" no doubt there were groups of both @entity20 and @entity19 supporters who attended that match with a view to confrontation			1
we 're talking relatively small numbers here and it should be possible to police those groups and , if possible , exclude them from the stadium			0

@entity19 fans fought with @entity20 supporters ahead of group match in @entity6
experts say the violence could have been prevented with more *forethought*
