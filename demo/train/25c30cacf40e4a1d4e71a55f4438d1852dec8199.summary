@entity0 -- world leaders kicked off a historic two - day meeting at the @entity0 on monday by unanimously approving a " political declaration " meant to stem a rising tide of noncommunicable diseases , now the world 's leading killer			1
it is only the second time a health issue has been debated at a special meeting of the @entity13 after the group 's pledge to take on @entity16 a decade ago			0
" this is a landmark meeting , " @entity0 @entity17 ban ki - moon said			2
" three out of every five people on @entity21 die from the diseases that we gather here to address			1
" illnesses that range from diabetes to heart disease to cancer are increasingly reaching developing nations , @entity17 said , which are often ill - equipped to provide the kinds of medicines and levels of treatment to offset their effects			1
" more than a quarter of all people who die from ( such diseases ) succumb in the prime of their lives , " he added			1
" the vast majority live in developing countries			0
" the measure is expected to be adopted in full after a second day of discussion tuesday			0
but it will then depend on cooperation from companies that produce food , alcohol and tobacco products to implement broad - sweeping policy shifts to achieve lasting changes that @entity0 members say they are hoping for			1
@entity54 director - general @entity53 called the issue a " slow - motion disaster , " citing one study that put the cost of noncommunicable diseases to the global economy at $ 30 trillion by 2030			1
the effect on individual households , analysts say , is often manifest in reduced physical capacities , long - term treatment and high health care costs			0
on the national scale , the effect is more clear			0
@entity68 costs for heart disease , stroke and diabetes in @entity72 alone amounted to $ 18 billion in 2005 , according to a @entity0 statement			1
@entity74 expended $ 11 billion that year , while @entity75 spent $ 9 billion and @entity76 spent $ 3 billion			2
a year later , 36 million people died from noncommunicable diseases worldwide , representing nearly two - thirds of all reported global deaths			1
@entity81 said the rise of these diseases is being driven by urbanization and " unhealthy lifestyles , " prompted by systemic use of alcohol , tobacco and readily available processed foods			2
" for a growing number of people , ( those foods ) are the quickest ways to fill their stomachs , " she said			2
meanwhile , global obesity levels have doubled since 1980 , according to a recent report			0
" obesity is the signal that something is terribly wrong , " said @entity81 , who urged a systemic approach among world governments to combat those diseases			2
traditionally more widespread in developed nations , obesity -- which , according to reports , is often a product of poor health practices and available food choices -- has increasingly spread to developing nations			0
death and illness from noncommunicable diseases are greater threats than transmissible diseases like malaria and hiv in every region except @entity118 , where they are on the rise , according to a @entity0 report			1
@entity17 on monday called for a more comprehensive intervention plan to help reduce the threat , asking for " tobacco - control measures , including raising taxes and bans on advertising and smoking in public places ; raising taxes on alcohol and enforcing bans on alcohol advertising ; reducing salt intake , " as well as replacing trans fats in foods with polyunsaturated fats			0
he called on member countries to promote public awareness about diet and physical activity , deliver hepatitis b vaccinations and encourage preventive care through counseling			0
" it is our collective responsibility to make this meeting a success for all mankind , " said @entity146 president @entity145 , who attended monday 's meeting .			0
