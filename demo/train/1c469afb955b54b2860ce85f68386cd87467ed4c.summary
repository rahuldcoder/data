the most senior @entity1 diplomat to defect and publicly embrace his country 's uprising is calling for a foreign military intervention to topple president @entity5			1
he also accused the @entity7 regime of collaborating with @entity9 militants against opponents both in @entity1 and in neighboring @entity11			1
" i support military intervention because i know the nature of this regime , " @entity12 told @entity13			2
" this regime will only go by force			0
" until a few days ago , @entity12 was @entity1 's top man in @entity19			1
his defection marks a shocking about - face for an official who occupied a critically important post			0
until fares was sent to @entity11 in 2008 , @entity1 had no ambassador stationed in @entity19 for more than 20 years			1
" i was at the top of the @entity1 regime , " fares said in his first interview with a @entity28 - based tv network since his defection			1
" but what happened in the last year during the holy revolution , all of the killing , the massacres , the refugees , and the declaration of war by @entity5 against the @entity1 people , stopped any kind of hope for reform or real change , which had been promised previously by @entity5			1
" i tried during the last year and a half to convince the regime to change its treatment of the people , " fares added			1
" but i was n't successful , so i decided to join the people			0
" opposition calls on @entity49 to act now @entity7 confirmed news of @entity12 ' defection in a short article published by @entity1 's state news agency @entity53 , which announced that the ambassador had effectively been fired for leaving the @entity1 embassy in @entity19 without official authorization			1
prior to his diplomatic assignment in @entity11 , fares served as a provincial governor in different parts of @entity1 for a decade			1
he was also a regional boss in @entity1 's ruling @entity63			2
photographs on @entity1 government websites as well as from @entity12 ' personal collection show that on more than one occasion , this native of the eastern city of @entity69 reported directly to the @entity1 president			2
in an interview that lasted for nearly two hours in the gilded halls of a luxury hotel in the @entity76 capital , @entity12 laid the blame for large - scale allegations of human rights abuses in @entity1 squarely at the feet of the country 's president			1
" the regime in @entity1 is a totalitarian regime and a dictatorship			2
there is only one person who gives the orders : one person who is the president , " fares said			0
@entity89 offers to host talks @entity1 's state news agency has maintained that " armed terrorist groups " are behind the violence , which the @entity93 estimates has killed more than 10,000 people since march 2011			2
@entity13 can not independently verify reports from @entity1 , including @entity12 ' allegations , because the nation has restricted access by international journalists			2
@entity1 opposition leaders applauded the very public departure of such a high - ranking @entity1 official because it clearly embarrasses and weakens the @entity7 regime			1
but they appeared reluctant to invite one of @entity5 's trusted lieutenants into the ranks of the opposition movement			0
" we do n't reject him because we want everyone to quit the ship , " said former @entity110 chairman @entity109 , who spoke to @entity13 in the lobby of the same @entity113 hotel where @entity12 was staying under @entity76 protection			0
@entity109 insisted he did not know the former @entity1 ambassador was sharing the same quarters			1
" but we can not put him in a political position ( in the opposition ) ... no one will accept @entity125 or fares at the head of the movement , " @entity109 added			0
the activist was referring to gen. @entity125			0
like fares , @entity125 is a @entity131 who once held a high rank in an @entity135 - dominated regime			0
he abandoned the @entity1 government and fled into exile just days before @entity12 ' departure			2
... there is friendship between us , " said @entity12			2
" but there has been no coordination between me and him in terms of defecting			0
" throughout the interview , @entity12 played down growing sectarian divisions between the ruling @entity135 minority and the @entity131 majority , who make up much of the current uprising			0
he also rejected the @entity1 government 's common claim that the rebellion is being led by militants from @entity9			1
instead , he accused @entity7 of cooperating closely with @entity9 militants , ever since the @entity28 invasion of neighboring @entity11 in 2003			1
" the @entity1 regime felt threatened and felt that it , too , might fall , " fares recalled			2
" so they had an agreement with @entity9 to keep the road open to @entity11			2
the militants started coming from all over the world through @entity1 , under the eyes of the @entity1 secret police , which are directly responsible for the killing of thousands of @entity11 in @entity11 as well as @entity28 and coalition forces			1
" the secret police were encouraging enthusiastic young people in @entity1 to go for jihad in @entity11 and join @entity9 , " fares continued			1
" @entity5 and his security forces are directly responsible for the killing of thousands and thousands of @entity11 and coalition forces , because he gave @entity9 everything it needed			2
he trained and provided shelter and he built safe havens for them to hide in			0
" one of these " safe havens , " fares said , was the @entity1 border village of @entity180 , near the border city of @entity182			0
in response to the accusations , a senior @entity28 administration official said that @entity12 ' claims about the @entity1 government 's cooperation with @entity9 during the war in @entity11 are " broadly consistent with our understanding			1
" " since 2003 , @entity5 allowed @entity9 and associates to facilitate weapons , money and fighters to @entity9 's @entity11 - based affiliate , setting the conditions for those same elements to shift from @entity1 - based facilitation to active attacks -- this time focused against the @entity5 regime , " the official said			1
" this emerging @entity9 operational presence in country bolsters our own argument that the sooner @entity5 leaves , the better , " said the official , noting that that the current @entity9 - linked effort in @entity1 is small and not representative of either the opposition or the broader population			1
in october of 2008 , the @entity28 government claimed responsibility for a controversial cross-border raid into @entity1 near @entity182			2
@entity28 officials later told @entity13 that special forces soldiers and helicopter gunships targeted an @entity11 man named @entity218 , who they called " the top facilitator of @entity9 foreign fighters into @entity11			1
" at the time , the @entity1 government angrily protested the violation of its airspace and what it said was the killing of eight civilians			0
four years later , however , fares claimed the @entity28 forces had in fact struck an @entity9 training camp run by one of @entity5 's close relatives by marriage			1
" this was a hiding place for @entity9 on the border with @entity11 , and it was under the control of @entity239 , the brother - in - law of the president , " fares said			1
" one hour after the raid , @entity242 was there at the location			0
a conversation took place between me and him ... and he was angry about the attack made against @entity180 and he was kind of scared , " fares recalled			0
claims like this , which @entity13 can not independently confirm , will likely make the former @entity1 ambassador a much sought - after asset for @entity257 intelligence agencies , as well as for the @entity76 government			1
@entity113 has publicly lobbied for arming @entity1 rebels against the @entity5 regime			0
fares went on to repeat a long - stated @entity1 opposition accusation : that the @entity1 government is staging @entity9 - style attacks in @entity1 as a fear - mongering tactic			1
the former ambassador was reluctant to explain the details of how he escaped from @entity19 to @entity113			0
he said he timed his departure with the escape of his wife and grown children from @entity1			0
but he had a message to the @entity1 president and his former colleagues in the government			0
" my former colleagues , i ask them to join the people and leave this corrupt regime			0
there is still time , " fares said			0
" to @entity5 , i say you do n't know history			0
two wills can not be defeated : the will of @entity284 and the will of the people			0
... history will curse you for the crimes you committed in @entity1			0

a @entity28 official says defector 's claims about @entity9 cooperation are " consistent "
@entity12 , former @entity1 ambassador to @entity11 , is the highest - ranking diplomatic defector
" i tried to convince the regime ... to change its treatment of the people , " he says
