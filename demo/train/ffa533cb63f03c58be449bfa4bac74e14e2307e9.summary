-- the year was 2002 , and group of young editors was trying to decide how risky it would be to put the @entity5 soccer team on the june cover of @entity7			1
it was a tough call for a magazine that had gotten off to a spectacular start serving up a strictly meat - and - potatoes diet of @entity12 , with a side of baseball ( @entity13 only , please			2
) or @entity15 mixed in			0
but seriously , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 ? they were the backbone of @entity21 in 2002 and the guys we wanted on the cover			1
sure , they are all household names now -- at least for sports fans -- but back then we wondered : " how many real sports fans even know these guys ? " you see , 12 years ago , talking anything but @entity12 or baseball with diehard sports fans in the @entity5 would get you laughed out of the room			1
soccer ( never futbol ) was considered a fringe sport -- a game mostly played and left behind in grade school			1
and certainly putting a soccer team on the cover of a national sports magazine was bound to flop on the newsstands			1
but we went with it anyway , thinking it would be fun to change things up a little bit -- give our readers a surprise			0
oh , how times have changed			0
unless you have been locked in a dark closet this week , you know : @entity5 is in the grips of futbol fever			1
how can we tell ? back in 2002 , the @entity56 match between the @entity5 and @entity57 was seen in an average of 1.36 million television homes -- the most - watched soccer telecast ever on @entity61 at the time -- based on a 1.62 rating , according to @entity64			1
this year , an average of 18.2 million @entity5 tuned in to @entity61 to watch the @entity56 game between the @entity5 and @entity67 , according to @entity64 numbers released by the network			1
that game also broke a record for the most - viewed @entity5 match on @entity73 , with 6.5 million viewers			1
and @entity12 ? step aside : the @entity5 - @entity67 match posted the kind of numbers typically reserved for " @entity78			2
" those @entity78 games averaged 13.6 million viewers last year , according to @entity64 numbers provided by @entity61			2
who 's driving this soccer obsession ? the younger generations , encouraged by a few 40 - something @entity87 parents			1
i 'm no soccer mom , but given a choice , i 'd much rather see my kid pick soccer than just about any other sport			2
it 's safer , cheaper , and more diverse			1
and it 's a true team sport			1
no one player is bigger than the team			0
everyone plays and everyone has a chance to help the team win			0
but how did this new love affair with the game happen ? how did the @entity103 allow futbol to come onto our turf and take over ? they 've even stolen our name			0
@entity109 , watching the @entity5 - @entity111 game at a beachside bar in @entity113 thursday , thinks he knows : " look , 40 years ago when i was growing up , we never even heard of @entity114 in @entity115			1
but then my family moved to @entity117			0
there , all my sons played soccer			0
" they were bored with baseball			0
you needed a ton of equipment and a big field			0
i started coaching and my family loved it			0
the game became our lives			0
" but not so fast @entity136			0
is soccer really ready to surpass the @entity12 as @entity5 ' favorite sport ? his younger nephew , @entity139 , thinks differently			1
@entity109 , who is a physical education teacher at @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity144 , agrees soccer has become the go - to sport for most young kids in @entity5			1
he thinks it 's the perfect sport for young people because it teaches the fundamentals of every sport : offense , defense , and spatial movements			2
but at least for now , football -- not futbol -- remains king			2
" @entity158 will tough to overcome but i do know that soccer will continue to grow , " says @entity109 , who has played and coached club soccer			2
" all my students love the game and follow it on an international level			0
it 's really neat to see			0
" this diehard sports fan is sold			0
it 's fast , furious and fun			2
and it 's a game that both boys and girls can excel at and enjoy			0
and as i travel the world this summer and walk into the local sports bar to watch the @entity56 games , you can be sure that i am the loudest , proudest @entity5 in the house			1

in 2002 @entity177 *struggled* over whether to put soccer on cover of @entity61 magazine
@entity182 : fast *forward* to 2014 's @entity56 *frenzy* and it seems @entity5 finally gets ' futbol '
why ? @entity5 parents like it : it 's safer , cheaper , diverse , and a true team sport , she says
@entity182 : american football wo *n't* be soon overcome , but soccer likely to keep growing
