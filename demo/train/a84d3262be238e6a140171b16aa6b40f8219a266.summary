the country 's @entity11 warned against " any type of activities that could affect the security or harm the national peace and safety , " @entity1 's official news agency reported			2

on tuesday , @entity1 @entity32 appealed for dialogue , saying that talks with opposition groups are scheduled to begin in july			1
