a fortnight ago the critics were wondering if the @entity4 could last the pace -- now that doubt looks to have been quashed -- and in some style			0
a 1 - 0 win over last year 's @entity9 finalist @entity10 proved @entity1 can mix it with @entity13 's elite when it really matters			1
having lost the home fixture against the @entity17 side in north @entity18 two weeks ago , victory was essential for @entity1 to keep hold of its own destiny			1
and it duly obliged thanks to @entity23 's second half winner -- his 11th goal in 16 games -- not bad for a player who had only mustered five in 91 apperances for the club over the past two years			1
" i was impressed mostly by our focus because we were under consistent pressure from the first to the last minute , " @entity1 manager @entity29 told @entity30			2
" nevertheless , we created chances and we could have scored a second			0
" a year ago , i thought it would be difficult for @entity23 to score goals but he 's developed tremendously and that 's a huge credit to him			2
" @entity23 has enjoyed a stunning season -- taking the @entity41 by storm			2
the @entity44 international has been a revelation at the heart of the @entity1 midfield and his latest strike secured one of the club 's most impressive @entity51 victories of modern times			2
@entity1 arrived in @entity17 to face a @entity10 side which had made its most successful start to a league season since 2010/11			1
having won all eight of its home games this season , including the victory in the @entity61 , @entity10 roared out the traps at their traditional breakneck speed			1
but despite dominating possession , the @entity17 side failed to find the breakthrough			0
@entity68 international @entity67 should have done better in the first half after being played through on goal but his effort sailed wide of the post			0
@entity10 pushed forward again after the interval but it was @entity1 which struck the killer blow with 62 minutes on the clock			1
@entity77 swung the ball into the penalty area and after @entity80 had managed to flick the ball on , @entity23 stole in to nod home from close range			2
@entity10 huffed and puffed as they searched for an equalizer but only a superb save by @entity86 denied @entity23 a second as @entity1 broke at speed			1
per @entity88 sent a header just over the crossbar as the visiting side looked to double its advantage			0
and although @entity10 pushed forward late on , it was unable to find the equalizer it so badly craved			2
" we dominated , we worked , we had good runs and we did a lot of things right			0
we played good football and it was not boring , " said @entity10 manager @entity99			2
" but we lacked the finish			0
we should have done more from our possession			0
" @entity10 now faces a fierce fight to qualify for the next stage after @entity106 recorded a 3 - 2 win over @entity108			1
the @entity110 side sits second , three points clear of @entity10 , with the two teams scheduled to meet in @entity17 on november 26			2
@entity113 scored twice and @entity114 was also on target for @entity106 , which is level on nine points with @entity1			0
elsewhere , @entity117 ended his goal drought with a double in @entity121 's 3 - 1 win over @entity122			1
the victory books @entity121 's place in the last 16 with two games to spare			1
@entity117 fired home the opener from the penalty spot before @entity129 headed a second			0
@entity122 , which sits second in the group , did pull a goal back when @entity121 defender @entity133 inadvertently diverted @entity135 's cross into his own net			1
but @entity117 sealed the win seven minutes from time with a classy finish to ensure @entity121 's place in the knockout phase for the 10th year in a row			1
@entity143 is still in the mix in @entity145 following a 1 - 0 win over @entity149 champion @entity147 in @entity150			1
@entity151 scored the only goal of the game for the @entity155 side , which has taken four points from four games -- one fewer than @entity122			0
@entity158 looks in good shape to qualify from @entity160 following a 3 - 0 win over @entity17 side @entity162			1
@entity163 scored twice and @entity164 was also on target as @entity158 bounced back from its weekend defeat in the @entity41 at @entity167			0
" i think it was good response but of course the first 15 minutes were difficult , " @entity158 manager @entity168 told @entity30			0
" we were a team without big maturity and stability after the defeat on sunday			0
after that we played very well and kept possession in a comfortable way and after the first goal we played well			0
" @entity181 side @entity180 is still in contention to qualify after it stole a late equalizer to draw 1 - 1 with @entity184			0
@entity180 is in third place but just one point behind @entity162 with two games remaining			0
in @entity189 , @entity188 qualified for the next stage with a comfortable 4 - 0 win over @entity192			1
@entity193 gave @entity188 an early lead before strikes from @entity196 and @entity197 sent the home side into the break with a three - goal cushion			1
@entity201 added a fourth after the interval as @entity188 equalled @entity205 's feat of qualifying for the last - 16 with four consecutive victories			1
@entity208 sits second in the table following its 1 - 1 draw against @entity211 in the day 's early game .			0

@entity1 claims victory at @entity10 with @entity23 goal
@entity117 *inspires* @entity121 to qualification
