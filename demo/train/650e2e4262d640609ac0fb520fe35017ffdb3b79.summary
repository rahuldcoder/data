-- one week ago , the chief of @entity3 's @entity2 , gen. @entity4 , told graduating cadets in the city of @entity7 that the " back of terrorism " in @entity3 had been broken , thanks to the sacrifices of @entity3 's soldiers			1
@entity4 was speaking at the " passing out parade " at the prestigious @entity15 military academy in @entity7 , the @entity16 of @entity3			1
at that very moment , the man who had dragged @entity3 into the " @entity18 " a decade earlier was , it transpires , just a mile or two away , living in apparent comfort behind the high walls of a very private compound			1
@entity23 , who had declared war on @entity3 , had apparently been living for months in a city that had made its name as a military garrison			1
@entity7 , pronounced @entity28 - tah - bahd , is some 60 miles by winding mountainous roads north of @entity3 's capital			1
surrounded by green hills , it is renowned for its trees and parks			0
it 's a popular retirement place for officers in the @entity3 army , partly because of its military academy , but also because of its agreeable climate			1
during @entity43 rule , the @entity40 of @entity41 described it as " picturesquely situated , " 4,120 feet above sea level			0
@entity7 sits on the @entity46 , an engineering marvel that links @entity3 with @entity48 through the @entity49			1
before much of @entity3 became off - limits to most foreign tourists , it was also a popular spot for those on their way to and from the @entity58 valley and the foothills of the @entity49			2
but despite its military traditions , its hockey fields and golf courses , @entity7 and neighboring districts are also familiar territory to @entity66 and other extremist groups			1
in january this year , @entity3 security forces stormed a modest house in the city and seized @entity71 , an @entity72 linked to @entity66 who had a $ 1 million bounty on his head under the @entity77 's @entity76			1
he had allegedly helped build the bombs used in the 2002 bombings in @entity80 that killed 200 people			0
@entity71 -- a key leader in the @entity72 terrorist group @entity82 -- had rented a room in the house of a retired accountant in @entity7 after arriving in @entity3 some months earlier on a forged visa			1
he is now being held ( after treatment for gunshot wounds sustained during his arrest ) pending a decision on his extradition			0
@entity71 's arrest followed that of a @entity3 in @entity7 called @entity94 , an alleged @entity66 facilitator who had been under surveillance for some time , according to @entity3 media reports			1
@entity94 had allegedly gone to @entity97 to meet two @entity99 militants who were planning to travel to @entity100 with @entity71			0
so @entity7 emerges as something of a way station for @entity66 and associated groups			1
geographically , that makes sense			0
as the crow flies , the city is just over 100 miles from the border with @entity109 in @entity110 , an area where @entity66 has kept a foothold since 9/11			0
even with poor roads and mountainous terrain in between , the journey can be completed in a day			0
it is even closer to the restive tribal territories			0
in the past two years , the @entity3 army in this area has been preoccupied with reversing the gains of the @entity3 @entity120 , rather than chasing down the remnants of @entity66 or launching the offensive against militants in @entity100 that @entity124 has long demanded			2
the area to the north of @entity7 saw a surge in @entity120 activity two years ago , as the @entity120 sought to extend their influence from the tribal areas that border @entity110 into what was @entity132 , now called @entity132			2
the town of @entity134 , just 30 miles from @entity7 and 60 miles from @entity135 , fell to the @entity120 early in 2009			2
they also established a training camp close to the town of @entity139 , a few miles from @entity7			2
the @entity3 military has since gradually reasserted control over the area , expelling the @entity120 from the @entity58 , but at a bloody cost			2
clashes continue sporadically in the area , and an attack on the offices of the charity @entity148 last year in @entity139 resulted in six of the non-governmental organization 's workers being shot dead			0
to the east of @entity7 is @entity152 , its forested hills hosting training camps for several groups committed to " liberating " @entity41 @entity152			1
so it is a city close to the front lines of several of @entity159 's insurgencies and terror campaigns			2
like much of the region , @entity7 has long been a theater of sectarian and religious rivalry			0
back in the mid- 19th century a @entity43 officer named maj. @entity165 brought peace to an area that saw violent confrontations between its @entity170 and @entity171 populations			0
@entity165 's contribution was recognized when the town was named after him			0
he even wrote a poem about the place that would bear his name : " i remember the day when i first came here and smelt the sweet @entity7 air ... "			0

@entity7 is home to @entity3 's *equivalent* of @entity16
it is on a key road , and is something of a way station for terrorist groups
other *wanted* terrorist leaders have been found in the city
