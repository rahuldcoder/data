president @entity1 has warned it is not just cycling that needs to crack down on the use of performance - enhancing substances			1
as cycling 's governing body the @entity7 grapples with the fallout of the @entity12 doping scandal -- which has resulted in the @entity13 being stripped of his seven @entity16 titles -- @entity1 called for every sport to remain vigilant			1
" i think every sport is at risk , " the former @entity19 vice president told @entity0			0
" they use different drugs in different sports : track and field , swimming , weightlifting , football has had it -- pick a sport and you could probably determine which drugs are the drugs of choice			0
" @entity1 also insisted that unless the @entity7 acted decisively , cycling could be irreversibly damaged			1
" it could be a watershed moment -- you hope that the @entity7 will stop trying to blame everyone else rather than themselves , " added @entity1			1
" we have to get this act together very quickly , because it is entirely likely that this was not the only team in the peloton involved in organizing cheating , " referring to the @entity48 's conclusion that the @entity50 team and @entity12 had run " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen "			2
" if they do n't get their act together , it could spin out of control			0
" sponsors are already dropping out for teams , individual sponsors have dropped @entity12 while the @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 will be wondering if some of their people are doing some of this			2
" when you see how pervasive the system of cheating was in one team -- this was probably not the only place it happened			0
you wonder where else it happened			0
" despite the extraordinary weight of evidence produced by the @entity48 and @entity7 chief @entity80 arguing @entity12 " deserves to be forgotten in cycling now , " the @entity77 has maintained his innocence , @entity83 has been a strong critic of the @entity7 , suggesting there is no way the organization could have been completely in the dark regarding the use of banned substances in cycling			1
the @entity92 was sued by the @entity7 in 2007 , after his term as @entity2 president had come to an end , for comments he made criticizing the body 's former president @entity99			1
an out of court settlement was reached in 2009 , with @entity83 acknowledging some of his comments could have been perceived as excessive but that he had felt the @entity7 's actions had been insufficient			1
@entity107 @entity83 argues that @entity107 shows just how systematic doping had become in cycling			2
@entity107 was an investigation -- started by the @entity61 police in may 2006 -- into the doping ring led by doctor @entity112 , which involved high - profile cyclists such as @entity115 and @entity116			0
" @entity107 has been stalled because of @entity61 bureaucracy -- probably because of the damning involvement of the @entity61 doctors involved , " explained @entity1			2
against a backdrop of the lurid doping headlines , the route for the @entity121 was announced on wednesday at an event in @entity125 ahead of the 100th edition of the grueling race			0
for the first time in 10 years , each of the @entity16 's 21 stages will take place within the @entity132 , with the riders starting on @entity134 , before completing the 3,360 kilometer marathon with a tradition dash along the iconic @entity137 on july 21			1
tour director @entity138 insisted the unveiling of the race route was a time to talk about the magic of the @entity16 rather than the issue of doping , although he insisted : " a movement has started a few years ago and it must go on			2
everybody must work on it			0
" @entity138 also argued that the @entity16 titles taken away from @entity150 @entity149 and @entity13 @entity151 for doping offenses suggested the current tests do work			1
@entity155 dominated the 2012 race , with @entity157 becoming the first @entity158 to win the title , with his compatriot and teammate @entity160 coming second			0
but it could be difficult for @entity163 to defend his title , with many observers already suggesting the 32 - year - old could struggle with 2013 's comparatively hilly route .			0
