-- it 's hard to overstate how frustrated @entity2 have been over the last few years by their failure to gin up a juicy @entity5 administration scandal			1
they tried with @entity6 and " @entity7 , " but those turned out to be gigantic nothing burgers			0
well now at last , they may have something , in either @entity11 or the @entity12 targeting conservative groups			1
unlike @entity11 , where even the @entity2 claiming it was " worse than @entity14 " ca n't quite say what the misconduct was ( unless you consider squabbling over talking points to be a nefarious and earth - shattering crime ) , the @entity12 affair is pretty straightforward			1
from what we know , employees in the @entity23 @entity12 office singled out conservative groups applying for tax - exempt status for extra scrutiny			1
if that turns out to be true , then it was absolutely wrong and the people responsible should be held to account , as everyone in both parties up to and including president @entity5 has agreed			1
but this controversy shines a light on a larger problem in the way our tax system interacts with our political system			1
@entity5 says some @entity12 employees ' failed , ' order accountability many @entity43 are probably hearing the term " 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) " for the first time , but a full context requires understanding two related types of groups			1
the first is 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) groups , which are charities that are supposed to have no involvement in partisan politics ; the second are the 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups , which are permitted to be a little more involved in the political process , with more latitude for lobbying and electioneering			1
if you make a contribution to a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organization , it 's tax deductible , but a contribution to a @entity63 ( 4 ) is n't			0
( both kinds of groups are charitable entities that do n't have to pay taxes on the money they take in			1
) in its 2010 @entity72 decision , the @entity70 declared that 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organizations would now be permitted to engage in " express advocacy " during election campaigns , meaning they could explicitly urge the election or defeat of candidates for office			0
nevertheless , 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups are still supposed to be primarily nonpolitical and devoted to " social welfare			1
" they can engage in some politics , but it 's supposed to be a minority of their activities			0
even before @entity72 , however , the law in this area was flouted so routinely that it made a mockery of the @entity12 mandate to keep charitable organizations from being partisan			1
though they exist all over the country , @entity96 in particular is full of organizations whose partisan political purpose is apparent to everyone , but which nonetheless are considered " social welfare " groups			1
some exist to advance conservative ideology , and some exist to advance liberal ideology			0
opinion : @entity5 's second - term curse ? not so fast everyone in the organization , with the possible exception of the receptionist or the deputy assistant it director , comes from the same party			2
when election season rolls around , their efforts turn to the campaign			0
if the group focuses on economic policy , it will issue reports on why the tax plans offered by the other side 's candidate are bogus			0
if it 's a foreign policy group , its representatives will assail the foreign policy record of the other side			0
if the organization is big enough , it might even be set up as two organizations , a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) that can accept tax - deductible contributions and a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) that ca n't			0
they 'll both be in the same office , run by the same people			0
there are multiple organizations that use this structure			0
for example , on the right you have the @entity145 and its ( c ) ( 4 ) twin , @entity146 , just like on the left you have the @entity148 and its ( c ) ( 4 ) twin , the @entity148			0
whatever the spirit of the law , dancing close to , but not over , the line of what 's permissible in the law 's letter is a daily concern for groups like these			0
as long as you 're careful about how you phrase your communication ( " candidate @entity161 's tax plan is a disaster " is fine ; " no one should vote for candidate @entity161 " is a no - no ) , the @entity12 will probably leave you alone			2
but after @entity72 , things changed			0
groups like @entity146 and the @entity148 are large organizations that do many different kinds of work on all kinds of issues			2
but now there are organizations with virtually no purpose other than influencing elections that apply for tax - exempt status , claiming that they 'll be engaging only in " education " or " research			0
" you may have heard , for instance , of @entity180 , the group @entity182 and other @entity2 strategists created to help defeat @entity5 in the 2012 election			2
it had a counterpart on the @entity189 side , a group started by former @entity5 staffers called @entity191			2
both raised tens of millions of dollars , which they spent on dueling ads in the presidential campaign			0
yet both @entity180 and @entity191 applied to the @entity12 as 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) " social welfare " organizations , claiming that politics was n't their primary purpose			1
if you believe that , i have a bridge in @entity203 i 'd love to sell you			0
but if their attorneys craft the language in their applications carefully enough , the @entity12 will approve their application			2
@entity12 approval of @entity63 ( 4 ) status means not only that the organizations do n't have to pay taxes , but also , unlike super pacs , they do n't have to disclose their donors -- and keeping your donors secret is one of the chief attractions of the @entity63 ( 4 )			1
the danger now is that because of this affair , instead of scrutinizing all 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) applications regardless of the applicants ' ideological perspective , a chastened @entity12 will let more and more applications slide by with minimal inspection			2
" dark money , " so called because 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) s do n't have to reveal their donors , could come to dominate our elections even more than it has since 2010			1
we could see the blooming of a thousand weeds , as everyone who wants to pour money into campaigns while hiding their identity starts a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) under the fiction of " social welfare , " and the @entity12 wo n't stop them			1
the @entity12 obviously needs better internal controls to ensure that it treats all groups by the same standards			1
but one reason this misconduct occurred was that after @entity72 , the @entity12 was deluged with thousands of applications for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) tax - exempt status , and many of the organizations were obviously political groups claiming to be " social welfare " organizations			1
if we 're going to have a special set of rules for groups focused on elections and lobbying -- which we should -- then we need rules that mark clearer lines between political and nonpolitical activity , and an agency with the will and the resources to enforce them			2
this scandal could be an opportunity to make the system work better			2
or it could cause it to deteriorate even further			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity272 .			0

@entity272 : *republicans* looking for a juicy @entity5 administration scandal
beyond obvious wrongdoing , @entity12 scandal sheds light on *flawed* system , he says
laws allow obviously political groups to pose as social welfare organizations , he says
@entity272 : *expanding* this *loophole* would allow more " dark money " into politics
