-- water testing by a private environmental engineering firm has discovered toxic chemicals in wells in a township in @entity6 , @entity7			1
@entity8 , a resident of the northeastern @entity7 township of @entity10 , revealed the results of the water tests from her well this week at an @entity14 hearing on hydraulic fracturing in @entity16 , @entity17			1
hydraulic fracturing , or " fracking , " is a controversial process used to extract natural gas from deep underground			1
critics say chemicals used in the process can be injected into groundwater			2
how fracking works @entity27 & @entity28 confirmed that ethylene glycol , propylene glycol and toluene were present in her water , @entity8 said			2
" i 'm fighting for my home , " @entity8 said thursday			0
" has n't this proven that [ fracking ] has n't been done safely ? " the contaminated @entity10 wells are in the @entity38 shale formation underneath parts of @entity7 , @entity17 , @entity40 and @entity41 , one of the largest natural gas deposits in the nation			1
the profitable natural gas reserve is attracting a flurry of gas companies wanting to drill			0
fracking yields fuel , fear in @entity51 the tests , which were verified by three certified laboratories , found chemicals in the majority of samples taken from water wells in @entity10 , said @entity58 , president of @entity59 , based in @entity60 , @entity7			1
" for anybody to say this was occurring prior to drilling is ludicrous , " @entity27 said friday			2
" the water was not like this before			2
" in 2008 , @entity27 was contracted by @entity67 , the company working in the @entity10 area , to perform pre-drilling tests on numerous wells in @entity6 , he said , adding that he did not test for nor discover ethylene glycol , propylene glycol and toluene			1
despite his latest findings , however , @entity27 said he can not reach any conclusions about the source of the chemical compounds found in the drinking water wells			1
" unfortunately no one can say that right now , until there is a way to track frac fluids , " he said			0
" and i think the gas companies know that			0
" ethylene glycol , propylene glycol and toluene are on the list posted on the @entity90 's website of chemicals used by hydraulic fracturing companies in the state			1
but @entity94 , a spokesman for @entity67 , said his company does not use the chemicals discovered by @entity59			1
" when we look at the ingredients we use in fracking and completing of wells , these chemicals are not found			1
toluene is not at all used , " @entity94 said			0
" if you look at what @entity103 said , he found these and he ca n't trace these to fracking			0
" the fact is that we do n't use these chemicals , " @entity94 said			2
the chemicals have a number of common applications and appear in products ranging from toothpaste to antifreeze , @entity27 said			2
but they can be toxic in higher concentrations			0
the @entity90 is conducting its own water tests across @entity10 , spokesman @entity117 said			1
" we want to see if our findings agree with @entity27 , " @entity117 said			0
" we want to see if we can duplicate it			0
" @entity90 water tests in april across @entity10 for ethylene glycol and propylene glycol were negative , and the agency is testing for " toluene and a host of other constituents , " he said			1
on friday , @entity117 said that @entity90 secretary @entity130 plans to make a " major announcement " regarding water supplies in @entity10 at the end of september			0
he would not elaborate about the details of the announcement			0
the @entity14 concluded its final hydraulic fracturing hearing on wednesday in @entity16			1
the @entity14 plans to begin a study in january and release initial results by late 2012			0
@entity8 is among a group of @entity10 residents who sued @entity140 - based @entity67 in november , alleging that the company contaminated their well water with methane gas and other contaminates			2
in hydraulic fracturing , drillers pump large amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals into the shale formation thousands of feet underground under high pressure			1
fracturing the shale around the well then allows the natural gas to flow freely			0
" this industry is cradle - to - grave , " @entity8 said			0
" and this baby has teeth			0

tests show toxic chemicals in water wells in northeastern @entity7
@entity165 says it shows controversial hydraulic fracturing is not safe
drilling company says it does not use those chemicals
