i do n't have all the answers and you ca n't show me a person that age who has it figured out			0
let me live " freedom on the line ? while the misdemeanor charges -- which carry a maximum of a year in jail -- would not ordinarily threaten a defendant 's freedom , @entity3 's felony probation could be revoked if a judge decides the new arrest is a violation			1

@entity3 was n't in town on some of the dates reported , the motion said			2
@entity119 , @entity3 's attorney , said the prosecutor 's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court			1
" and i do n't mean just false , it is fraudulent , " @entity119 said			0
the @entity0 district attorney 's office has " tortured " @entity3 during his probation more than any client he 's ever had , @entity119 said			1
