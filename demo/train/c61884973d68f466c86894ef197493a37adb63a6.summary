-- @entity1 and @entity2 have expressed their concern for the future of @entity6 after their great tennis rival pulled out of this month 's @entity9 due to his ongoing knee problems			1
the @entity11 withdrew from the season 's final grand slam event on wednesday , when @entity1 began his preparations at the @entity15 with a 6 - 3 6 - 2 win over @entity18 's @entity17 " i wrote him and he told me it was n't looking good at all			1
i kind of knew , " world no. 1 @entity1 told reporters after setting up a third - round clash with @entity24 rising star @entity23			1
" but obviously when it 's official it 's disappointing for tennis , there 's no doubt about it			0
i would love to have him in the draw			0
in particular 12 days before the @entity9 you figure he might still have time to fix what he has to fix to get ready			1
" that 's what is sort of scary			0
there is obviously the whole debate going on if he is going come back for this year			0
he 's definitely got some more weeks off now because of it			0
i hope in hindsight this is a very smart decision by him			0
but it 's obviously a big blow and disappointing news for the tennis world			2
" former no. 1 @entity6 won a record seventh @entity51 title in june after his customary busy clay season , but lost in the second round at @entity54 and was unable to defend his @entity50 at @entity55			1
" @entity62 is going to lose a little bit because of @entity6 not being there and playing , because he 's somebody that has made a history of this sport , " said @entity9 champion @entity2 , who began his @entity15 campaign with a hard - fought 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 2 win over @entity58 of @entity59 , having retained his @entity61 title on sunday			1
" we all know how good he is and how popular he is			0
obviously it 's that serious that it takes him out from the tour for the last couple of months			0
i 'm sure that if he was able to perform in the @entity74			0
" @entity6 and @entity2 had contested four successive grand slam finals , a run that was broken at @entity54 when @entity1 beat @entity78 to join @entity79 on seven titles at the grass major and reclaim the top ranking from the @entity83			1
@entity2 , last year 's @entity15 runner - up , is seeking to improve his form in his next match against @entity18 veteran @entity87			1
" really just trying to put another ball more in the court than my opponent was enough to win , " he said			0
" i 'm obviously not very satisfied with the performance			0
i will have to play much better than i did in order to go far			0
" @entity78 , who succeeded @entity6 as the men 's @entity94 champion after a revenge win over @entity1 at @entity54 this month , also paid tribute to a player he has faced in five grand slam semifinals and two quarterfinals			1
" i like @entity6 a lot as a friend			2
i 'm disappointed for him , " said the world no. 4 , who beat @entity74 @entity109 6 - 2 6 - 4 in his @entity15 title defense opener , having pulled out in @entity104 after his first match due to a knee worry of his own			1
" it 's obviously tough for him			0
he 's had trouble with his knees in the past			2
so , you know , i hope he can rest , does n't come back too early , and gets them fixed so he can get back to playing his best tennis			0
" the 25 - year - old will be hoping for a good run in @entity15 before continuing his quest for a first grand slam title at @entity123			1
" in the immediate aftermath of big wins or good tournaments , normally you 'll feel quite confident and comfortable going for your shots in the important moments and even at the beginning of matches , " he said after setting up a third - round clash with @entity126 's @entity125 , who beat @entity127 of @entity128 6 - 4 6 - 3			1
" i 'm hoping it helps me not only this week but going into the @entity9 and big matches in the future			2
i think it will give me that extra bit of confidence and probably feel a bit calmer going into them			0
" fifth seed @entity145 will play 2011 @entity148 @entity147 following a straight - forward 6 - 3 6 - 0 win over @entity151 's @entity150			2
@entity152 's @entity147 advanced courtesy of a battling 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) 6 - 3 6 - 4 defeat of world no. 42 @entity156			2
in the women 's tournament , @entity157 joined sister @entity160 in the last 16 after coming from behind to beat @entity162 's @entity161 2 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2			2
@entity157 will next face @entity51 finalist @entity163 of @entity59 , who she thrashed in straight sets at the @entity94			1
fourth seed @entity165 , who had a first - round bye after winning her first title this year in @entity169 on monday , defeated @entity171 's @entity170 to earn a clash with @entity174 's @entity173			1
