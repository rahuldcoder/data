@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 on thursday asked attorney general @entity3 to provide a legal analysis that endorsed the swap of five @entity7 figures held at the @entity8 in @entity9 for @entity11 sgt. @entity10			1
it was the latest salvo in clashes between @entity14 and president @entity15 over what to some lawmakers appears to be the president 's tendency to act without consulting @entity20			1
@entity2 , the top @entity21 on the @entity22 , said he was rebuffed earlier this year when he asked the @entity23 to release its legal analysis for when the president issues executive orders			1
but on @entity10 , the lone remaining captive from the wars in @entity29 and @entity30 who was released over the weekend , he thinks the department needs to explain itself			0
a @entity34 official told @entity1 the @entity23 's @entity36 opinion on the @entity10 matter was verbal and , as typically happens , likely will be issued in the form of a written opinion later			0
the department often refuses to release such opinions because they are considered protected under attorney - client privilege and the presidential executive privilege			0
@entity2 , in his letter to @entity3 , nonetheless makes his case that while " it is too late for @entity14 to express its concerns about these transfers in time to prevent them ... this measure of transparency will at least allow the @entity34 people to better understand the administration 's purported basis for ignoring the legal requirement that @entity14 be notified in advance , and shed additional light on this controversial decision			2
" @entity2 also said sharing the @entity23 's legal advice may also ensure the president abides by his oath " to carry out the law			1
at issue is the administration 's decision to ignore a restriction in the current defense policy law , signed by @entity15 last december , which requires 30 - day notice to @entity14 before transferring terror detainees from @entity8			2
@entity15 attached a statement when he signed the law that called the restrictions on transfers an illegal infringement on presidential executive powers and declared the right to ignore them when national security interests required it			0
@entity80 said on @entity1 's " @entity81 " on sunday that the @entity82 was given advice by the @entity23 before the swap			1
hints of the legal advice provided to the @entity82 can be found in statements issued in recent days by the @entity88			1
@entity90 spokeswoman @entity89 said in a statement that the administration 's interpretation of the law determined that the 30 - day notification requirement " should be construed not to apply to this unique set of circumstances , in which the transfer would secure the release of a captive @entity34 soldier , and the secretary of defense , acting on behalf of the president , has determined that providing notice as specified in the statute could endanger the soldier 's life			0
" @entity89 's statement said that because the 30 - day notice would have required the @entity82 to delay the swap , the notification requirement would interfere with the president 's constitutional power to protect @entity34 abroad and protecting @entity34 soldiers			2
@entity89 added : " because such interference would significantly alter the balance between @entity14 and the president , and could even raise constitutional concerns , we believe it is fair to conclude that @entity14 did not intend that the administration would be barred from taking the action it did in these circumstances			0
" the six soldiers at center of @entity125 debate who is @entity10 ? @entity10 ' life ' video shown , senators still skeptical			0
