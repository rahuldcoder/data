-- no city better exemplifies @entity3 's investment in its western interior than @entity5 , the booming capital of @entity6 , famous for pandas and spicy food			1
the city recently hosted the @entity10 and announced that visitors from 45 countries can enjoy a 72 - hour visa - free stay , further cementing its rise as a major tourism destination			0
yet only two hours from this metropolis of 14 million people lies a town that has remained fundamentally untouched by the economic changes that have transformed so many lives in @entity3 over the past 35 years			1
@entity22 -- a coal town that has seen its population fall from a peak of 20,000 to 1,500 in the years since the mine ceased operation -- is an anomaly in @entity3			1
it 's a town that 's actually worse off in 2013 than it was in 1963			2
the vast workers ' auditorium , miners ' cottages ( several built by the @entity32 in the 1930s ) , schools and hospitals are all empty and in a state of abject disrepair , but the fact that more tourists are arriving on the steam railway means the town 's worst days may now be behind it			1
the narrow - gauge rail line was built to connect @entity22 with the river town of @entity45 in 1958 and has six intermediate stops along its 19.8 - kilometer ( 12.3 - mile ) route			1
although used primarily for the transportation of coal , it continues to provide a passenger service			0
in fact , until 2012 there was no road to @entity22 and the town could be reached only by train or on a motorbike running alongside the tracks			1
tickets for " local " trains cost 5 rmb ( about 80 cents ) to ride the line in its entirety , while those for the new tourist trains from @entity65 are rmb 50 ( $ 8 )			0
these services are air - conditioned , provide a seat ( not guaranteed on local trains ) and will usually stop in @entity69 to allow passengers to photograph the most scenic part of the route			2
all trains are powered by one of six working steam engines that are housed and serviced in @entity76			1
more on @entity0 : checking in on @entity5 , @entity3 's latest urban star @entity3 's industrial heritage most passengers , both locals and tourists , disembark in @entity22 , but an interesting alternative is to continue to the final stop , @entity84 , to take in the @entity86 slogans and artwork that decorate the buildings right next to the platform			1
@entity84 is also home to the coal mine @entity92 and its surrounding villages relied on for more than 70 years			0
the mine has been open as a tourist attraction since 2008 and daughters of former miners ( the guides are all female ) lead informative tours			0
after emerging back into daylight , the 20 - minute walk to @entity22 through plantain groves passes many buildings of interest , including the former @entity105 , hospital and middle school			1
with a well put together museum in @entity22 , housed in the @entity112 - built former town - administrative center , the mine and steam engines mark the beginning of a nascent interest in industrial heritage in @entity3			1
steam enthusiasts arrive from , chiefly , the @entity32 , @entity117 , the @entity118 and @entity119 , but it 's @entity3 tourists that the town is trying to attract in larger numbers			1
an increasing number of chartered trains bringing in groups from @entity5 and further afield attest to the success of the local campaign sign - posting the railway as " a living fossil of the @entity131			2
" along with the industrial heritage appeal , @entity92 is attracting tourists interested in the social history aspect of a town that has been frozen in time			0
@entity86 artwork and slogans that adorn many buildings have been repainted and the original " @entity140 stage , " where only 40 years ago " struggle sessions " viciously humiliated supposed class enemies , has been authentically restored			1
the @entity143 makes a fascinating addition to the well - established local itinerary of @entity146 and @entity147			2
with outstanding hiking opportunities in the bamboo - covered hills that surround the line , fresh , fiery and delicious @entity6 food and accommodation at rmb 50 - 100 per night it also makes for an ideal weekend excursion from @entity5			0
more on @entity0 : @entity156 in @entity5 essential info to get to the train line , take a taxi from downtown @entity5 to @entity161 bus station for rmb 25 and purchase a ticket to @entity163 for rmb 68			0
buses run every hour and the journey takes approximately two hours			0
once in @entity166 take a local bus , taxi or motorbike taxi ( rmb 50 ) to either @entity76 -- the true beginning of the line -- or @entity172 , where the tourist trains commence			0
it 's possible to hike the entire length and attendants are on hand to say when it 's safe to pass through each of the six tunnels			0
accommodation is available en route but it 's easiest to find in @entity22			2
a local guesthouse will cost in the region of rmb 50 - 60 per night and a room in the new station hotel is rmb 100			0
visitors arriving in @entity189 can take the 431 kmh ( 267 mph ) @entity190 to begin their @entity3 experience on the world 's fastest train			2
the contrast between this and the @entity197 trains trundling along at 30 kph perfectly encapsulates the divide between old and new and rural and urban that so marks modern @entity3			2
