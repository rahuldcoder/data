-- it 's the stuff of movies			2
the kind you watch when it 's a friday night , you 're feeling lazy , and , oh look ! a bucket of hummus ! that kind of movie			2
floating untethered into the fog			0
infested with hundreds of cannibal rats			1
slowly and perilously drifting toward shore			0
but , you see , this is n't a movie			0
the big fear is that this completely real ghost ship could actually be ready to hit land and unleash rat - feces - palooza on the people of @entity26 or the @entity27 , who are , no doubt , just innocently going about their day , doing whatever it is those people do			1
like building pretty stone fences and arguing with sheep			0
( by the way : if @entity37 is n't already a huge concert event , it should be			0
tweet your pick for headlining band with # @entity43			0
) so , here 's what happened			0
back in 1976 , a 4,200 - ton cruise ship called the @entity47 was built in @entity48 and was specially designed to sail @entity50 's elite travelers around the coldest regions on @entity52			1
because , you know ... @entity50			1
why go to the @entity54 when you can spend seven days floating next to an iceberg covered in seal turds ? eventually , though , the private owners of the ship racked up too much debt , and , in 2010 , @entity62 authorities seized the vessel , which had been docked in @entity64 's , @entity65 where it was , presumably , quite bored			1
two years later , the @entity62 sold it for scrap and began hauling the old girl down to the @entity69 so it could be dismantled and possibly turned into steel drums			0
but then , only one day after leaving port , the towline snapped in heavy seas , and the @entity47 decided to piss off across the @entity75			1
as one does when you have nothing better to do and you 're a boat			0
" ( @entity78 ) i would like to have seen @entity80			0
" eventually , another @entity62 ship was sent out to corral the wayward vessel in what can only be described as the slowest , crappiest , worst - attended rodeo of all time			1
but once captured , the @entity47 was safely hauled farther out to sea , away from @entity62 oil rigs			1
and then they just sort of cut it loose in international waters			0
because , hey , what 's the worst that could happen ? @entity94 , the government department responsible for roads and planes and trains and @entity93 , assured its citizens that the @entity47 " no longer poses a threat to the safety of [ @entity62 ] offshore oil installations , their personnel , or the marine environment			1
" as for everyone else and the hundreds of diseased cannibal rats floating around the @entity75 ? " @entity108 ' boot that , eh			1
" and , so , the 295 - foot ship goes sliding by			1
free ! but then , in march 2013 , two lifeboats suddenly fell off the ship and landed in the water			1
this automatically triggered warning signals that alerted authorities that , holy crap , this thing had floated two - thirds of the way across the @entity75 and was heading straight toward @entity27 and @entity26			1
so , radar operators and pilots went looking for the ship			2
and they could n't find it			0
and , now , months later , several news agencies are reporting that the @entity47 might actually still be intact and getting closer to land			1
@entity62 's @entity127 explained that the vessel pretty much sat on it 's fat , metal butt in that dock in @entity65 for over two years , " virtually guaranteeing " that the ship is infested with hundreds of these little bastards			1
and since there 's no food on board , the rats have likely turned on each other			2
" damnit , @entity139 ! " " @entity140			0
" the big fear , now , is that a monster storm might give the ship the extra push it needs to finally make landfall			2
however , people are still hopeful that they can corral it at sea long before that actually happens			2
in which case , scrap haulers will have to climb on board and deal with the rats			2
which sounds like a lovely way to spend an afternoon			0
but it 's also possible that none of this will happen			0
the @entity159 recently released a statement saying : " there is no further action required by @entity26 and there are no reports and sightings			1
" and the @entity27 @entity166 pointed out : " we have received no reported sightings of the vessel since april last year			1
" helping to calm fears even more , the @entity169 reports that maritime analyst @entity171 believes the vessel has probably capsized and is now resting at the bottom of the ocean			0
( where , i 'm told , rats can not live			2
) " there was a report of a epirb signal from her , " @entity171 said			0
" that 's an emergency beacon that normally only activates when the ship has actually sunk			2
" and if you 're still concerned , just know that the official spokesman for @entity27 prime minister , @entity184 , says that this threat is n't a government priority			1
when asked if the @entity187 should intervene , he simply said , " gosh , we 're almost in a b - movie script development meeting here			0
follow @ @entity190 on @entity191 .			0

the @entity47 was built in 1976 as an arctic cruise ship for elite @entity50 travelers
in 2012 , the abandoned ship was *accidentally* lost at sea and believed to be infested with cannibal rats
recently , media *publications* have warned that the ship might actually strike the coast of @entity26 or the @entity27
