where are two of the fall season 's best new shows ? it turns out , they 're on the @entity4			1
between last week 's debut of " @entity7 " and monday 's arrival of " @entity9 , " the younger - skewing network is batting 1.000			1
critics have reacted positively to " @entity7 , " a spinoff of " @entity12 " and an origin story of the lightning fast superhero , as well as to " @entity9 , " an adaptation of a @entity17 program			2
" @entity7 " : what 's the verdict ? " @entity28 " stars @entity21 as 23 - year - old @entity22 , the daughter of a young single mother who has taken her grandmother 's advice to preserve her virginity to heart			2
but when @entity28 accidentally gets pregnant during a doctor 's visit -- it was accidental artificial insemination , to be exact -- @entity28 's life starts to look something like the telenovelas she watches with her mother and grandmother			0
the plot hinges on a twist that 's soapy even by the @entity4 's standards , but critics say " @entity9 " works , and primarily because of star @entity21			1
the @entity45 ' @entity44 has praised " @entity28 " as " one of the best things to come out of the fall season , " and " the wrap " agreed that the freshman series is one of this fall 's " best new offerings			0
" " ( @entity55 ) hanks to star @entity21 , who makes the lead character believable and likable , the journey to @entity28 's choice ( about the pregnancy ) and the inevitable consequences that follow make ' @entity9 ' highly entertaining and compelling television , " @entity53 says in its review			0
the plot may seem overwhelming , " but ' @entity28 ' approaches the melodrama with a sly wink , and @entity21 grounds it with a warmly genuine performance as @entity28 , whose relationship with her mother ( @entity69 ) is already primed to be one of the show 's best features , " @entity62 said			0
" where the series could get preachy , it 's tempered , and above all , the whole thing 's just a lot of fun			0
" ratings for the @entity4 's two new shows have been strong , too , as " @entity7 " became the @entity4 's highest - rated and most - watched premiere in five years when it bowed on october 7			1
" @entity28 " did n't come close to " @entity7 's " 4.8 million watching when it premiered monday , but it also held its own against its competitors at 9 p.m. et with an audience of 1.6 million and a rating of 0.6 in the adult demo of 18 - 49			0
that gives " @entity28 " the bragging rights of drawing the @entity4 's biggest audience at 9 p.m. on mondays in more than two years .			1

the @entity4 's two new fall shows are getting strong buzz
both " @entity7 " and " @entity9 " have been well - received
" @entity95 " premiere has been praised as one of the best this season
