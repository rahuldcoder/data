thanks to hard - drinking , hardworking @entity2 , we 've traveled through the ' 60s in style			1
now let 's take a look at the ad man 's @entity6			1
" @entity14 , " the @entity9 series that @entity10 called " the greatest tv drama of all time , " is back for a new season on sunday			1
and though it 's filmed primarily in @entity16 , the show is set in @entity6 , and notable locations across the city turn up in the script as liberally as a heap of pastrami on rye			1
in preparation for the season six premiere , we offer you this guide to the @entity6 haunts of ad exec @entity2 and his endlessly entertaining cohorts at @entity30			2
' @entity14 ' and the other 1960s eat on an episode titled " @entity36 in the face , " bosses - on - the - loose @entity2 and @entity33 spend their lunch -- and expense accounts -- taking full advantage of the eats and drinks at the venerable @entity43 , some of which later embarrassingly ended up on the carpet at the feet of a group of potential clients			1
hopefully you 'll have more restraint when you visit this 100 - year - old seafood establishment on the lower level of @entity53 , where tourists mingle with commuters over martinis and platters of freshly shucked oysters and other fishy delights			1
@entity60 42nd st. , www.oysterbarny.com another celebration featuring our @entity14 stars , this time @entity2 and the lusty wife of an insult comic , took place at legendary restaurant @entity66			2
even the framed celebrity caricatures on its walls were re-created for the scene			0
located in the heart of the @entity74 , @entity72 's has been a favorite with the @entity77 crowd for more than 85 years ( the @entity78 were thought up here ) , and you 'll feel like a star just for having eaten here			2
234 w. 44th st. , www.sardis.com 10 trips that can change your child 's life drink the @entity86 has been featured in a couple of " @entity14 " scenes , including one in which @entity2 retreats here after being kicked out of the house by his wife , @entity91			1
a stay at this landmark hotel will have you feeling like a part of the show , especially since its decor gives it the appearance of an elaborate " @entity14 " set piece , but the place to really connect with the show is just past the lobby in the @entity103			1
on april 7 , to coincide with the season premiere , the lounge will host a viewing party with complimentary whiskey tastings and a " best ' @entity109 " contest			0
the festivities will continue with themed cocktails and an invitation for patrons to dress in their ' 60s best each sunday the show airs			2
45 e. 45th st. , www.theroosevelthotel.com remember @entity115 and her colleagues doing the twist at a local watering hole after she nailed the @entity120 presentation in season one ? the site was @entity123 's , one of the oldest bars in @entity6			2
truly a @entity126 institution and a popular hangout among ad execs in the 1960s , @entity123 's was once described by one of its beloved barmen as " the @entity133 of saloons			0
" @entity135 , www.pjclarkes.com mad men , mad ' dos : what the late ' 60s really looked like stay when @entity2 and friends started their own agency at the end of season three , they set up shop , at least temporarily , in a suite at the @entity145			0
the fabled lodging , which overlooks @entity147 , was renovated and modernized a few years back , so your room might not ooze nostalgia			0
but if you close your eyes tight enough , you might just be able to imagine @entity152 typing away in the corner or @entity154 squawking on the phone with a client			0
2 @entity60 61st st. , www.tajhotels.com/pierre given that the @entity158 in @entity159 is the scene of a lunchtime tryst between copywriter @entity115 and a fellow named @entity163 from a rival agency , it 's only appropriate that the prestigious property is offering a special " @entity14 " package for fans of the show			1
it includes accommodations in one of its luxurious suites , which will be stocked with a dozen roses , strawberries and a box of chocolates , as well as two free cocktails either at the @entity179 or brought to your room			0

the doorman there to open the cab door for you only adds to the allure			0
1000 third ave. , www.bloomingdales.com work the pitchmen of @entity14 officed at an address on @entity205 that does n't actually exist in real life , but a number of big - time ad agencies can be found along this historic avenue			1
