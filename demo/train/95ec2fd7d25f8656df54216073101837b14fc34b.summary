-- @entity1 was 18 when the first edition of his " movie guide " came out in 1969			1
forty - five years later , the book -- a well - thumbed totem as familiar on film fans ' coffee tables as a bowl of popcorn or a stained drink coaster -- will soon be no more			1
the 2015 edition , out tuesday , will be the last			1
@entity1 wishes he did n't have to end its run , he said in a phone interview			1
but the writing is on the wall			1
" i saw it coming a couple years ago , " said @entity1 , 63			1
" there were pretty consistent strong sales for many , many years , and that started to change			1
it came as kind of a jolt			1
" ironically , it 's a screen that 's killed off the " movie guide " -- the computer / tablet / smartphone screen			1
in the digital age , the paper " movie guide , " like former competitors such as @entity33 's " movies on tv " and @entity35 's " @entity34 , " is n't as necessary when @entity37 and @entity38 ( not to mention countless blogs ) are at your fingertips			1
for that matter , even the long - dead " @entity46 , " a cd - rom that was cutting edge in the mid- ' 90s , is now a quaint artifact			1
@entity1 admits as much in the new guide 's introduction			1
" the book 's loyal followers know that we strive to offer something one ca n't easily find online : curated information that is accurate and user - friendly , along with our own reviews and ratings , " he writes			1
" but when a growing number of people believe that everything should be free , it 's impossible to support a reference book that requires a staff of contributors and editors			1
" the material wo n't be moving to the @entity66 , he told @entity67 in an interview			1
" @entity72 " -- originally " tv movies " -- has been @entity1 's claim to fame since he was a senior in high school			1
the historian and reviewer was a movie fan even as a child growing up in @entity77 , and through the years -- whether coordinating programs for the @entity79 , teaching at @entity81 's @entity80 or reviewing films for " @entity83 " -- he 's always come back to the " movie guide , " compiled with the assistance of reviewers such as @entity87 , @entity88 and managing editor @entity89			1
oh , he 's not retiring -- there will still be a " @entity91 , " and he continues to review movies for his @entity94 blog and @entity95			1
he also has other claims to fame , such as the @entity99 record for shortest review			2
@entity0 talked to @entity1 about the origins of the " movie guide , " the role of the critic and whether he 's ever changed his mind			1
the following is an edited and condensed version of the interview			2
@entity0 : how did " @entity1 's @entity91 " start ? @entity1 : it was not my idea			2
i was doing what we used to call fanzines			1
a friend and i did our first version of that when we were in the fifth grade , and it just kept going from there			2
when i was 13 years old , i found out about a couple fairly successful fanzines ( the 8 - @entity122 and @entity123 ) and wrote and offered my services as a writer			2
so i saw my first byline in print when i was 13 years old			2
after two years of contributing to @entity123 , the editor and publisher wrote to me and said , " i do n't have time to do this anymore			2
would you like to take it over ? " so i inherited his mailing list , his magazine and his format			2
he had 400 subscribers around the world			2
it was a big step up for me			2
i was 15 years old and i was editor and publisher of this magazine			2
a couple years later , i was walking down the hallway of my high school in @entity146 , @entity77 , and an @entity148 teacher stopped me			2
she 'd seen the magazine and said , " i have a friend who 's an editor at @entity150 in @entity151 and i think you two would hit it off			2
call him and go see him after school one day			1
" i went to see him and i brought some copies of the magazine			2
he said , " what 's that ? " i said , " it 's a magazine i publish for old movie buffs			2
" he said , " do you know this book called ' movies on tv ' by @entity33 ? " i said yes			2
he said , " what do you think of it ? " i said , " i think it 's fine as far as it goes			2
" he said , " what would you do differently ? " now , i knew this book backwards and forwards			0
( so ) i rattled off all those ideas			0
he said , " i 'm looking for someone to do a rival book			0
how would you like to do it ? " what do you say ? i said , " well , i guess so			0
" @entity0 : you 're still in high school			0
@entity1 : 17 years old			0
@entity0 : and the first edition came out the next year ? @entity1 : the next year , when i was 18			1
( at first ) it was only a modest success , and when it came out all i saw was its flaws and shortcomings			0
it was five years before we got a chance to update it			0
at that point , i said i want to make it better , and that 's what i 've been trying to do ever since			0
one of the nice things when it became an annual ( in 1986 ) was that , if somebody would send us a correction , i knew we could fix it the next time out			0
@entity0 : what movies have evolved over the editions that were four stars and now two , or vice versa ? @entity1 : the most extreme example i can think of is " @entity205 , " because i 'm a wimp			0
i ca n't see graphic horror movies -- wo n't and ca n't			0
i was chewing my jacket most of the time i was watching it			0
i found it upsetting on a visceral level			0
i did not enjoy myself			0
so i wrote a review that reflected that			0
twenty - five years later it was reissued theatrically and i went to see it again , having absorbed an awful lot in the 25 years that had passed , including all the imitations and ripoffs			0
i said , this a masterful piece of work			1
so i completely rewrote and rerated the film			1
i have n't done it a lot			0
@entity0 : do those changes have any effect ? @entity1 : when people used to ask me about the influence of critics , i 'd say , what influence ? if film critics really had influence , there would n't have been a " friday the 13th , @entity233 2 , " let alone two decades ' worth			1
and conversely , the small films we love to champion would become big hits			0
that does n't happen either			0
@entity0 : you 're kind of the last national film critic now , since @entity241 passed away			1
@entity1 : that 's because of television , let 's face it			0
even the book got its biggest boost when i got on tv			0
in fact , i 'd been on " et " about a year , early ' 80s , and i got a call from my editor in @entity151			1
he said , " we 've just had our sales meeting and we 'd like to make two changes to the cover : we 'd like to put your name above the title and your picture on the cover			0
" i said , that 's ok with me			0
there are many other critics who are more eloquent than i am , more incisive than i am , but i got national television exposure for 30 years on " @entity83 " and on various cable channels and that 's given me tremendous visibility and recognizability			1
@entity0 : who do you read ? @entity1 : i think my favorite film critic is one who 's not as widely read as he should be , which is @entity275 , formerly of @entity276 and now of @entity277			1
i think he 's brilliant and incisive			0
i do n't know how he absorbs as much as he does in one viewing of a movie			0
he 's also extremely articulate -- great command of language			0
i read other people too , but i do n't read very much because i 'm writing my own reviews			0
@entity0 : what do you think of aggregation sites , like @entity287 and @entity288 ? @entity1 : they serve their purpose , but as i like to remind people , every tomato is a critic			1
for people who say film critics are obsolete , then you would n't get a score on @entity287 or @entity288			1
those scores are indicative of something			0
@entity0 : do you feel a sense of loss with the book finishing its run ? @entity1 : i probably could n't even describe to you how enormous a change this is			1
it 's affected me already			0
we 'd already be working on next year 's book by now			0
it takes a lot of doing things to break old habits , and one of my habits is keeping track of details when i watch a movie -- is somebody unbilled , does the movie say it 's a @entity321 - @entity320 co-production , things like that			0
and i really do n't have to keep track of that , do i ?			0

" @entity72 " 2015 edition will be the last
film historian and critic has been compiling it since he was 18
critics have little influence , he says , but can call attention to good work
end of the guide leaves him at a loss
