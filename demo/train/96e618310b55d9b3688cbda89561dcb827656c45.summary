-- @entity1 is unfortunately no stranger to earthquakes			1
a quake similar to saturday 's struck almost exactly the same part of @entity1 on february 20 , 1835 -- almost exactly 175 years ago			1
on that occasion , the young @entity8 naturalist and geologist @entity6 was in @entity1 as part of his voyage on @entity12			1
the 1835 earthquake has been estimated as magnitude 8.5 , whereas that of february 27 , 2010 , has been measured as 8.8			2
the earthquake of 1835 occurred around 11 a.m. and lasted about two minutes			2
the main shock destroyed much of @entity18 in just six seconds			0
there were aftershocks for several weeks and three tsunamis , each one larger than the last , starting about half an hour after the earthquake and bringing further devastation			2
@entity6 was on shore near @entity25 , 200 miles south of @entity18 , during the quake and recorded in his diary : " i was on shore & lying down in the wood to rest myself			1
it came on suddenly & lasted two minutes ( but appeared much longer )			0
the rocking was most sensible ; the undulation appeared both to me & my servant to travel from due @entity34			0
there was no difficulty in standing upright ; but the motion made me giddy			0
i can compare it to skating on very thin ice or to the motion of a ship in a little cross ripple			0
... an earthquake like this at once destroys the oldest associations ; the world , the very emblem of all that is solid , moves beneath our feet like a crust over a fluid ; one second of time conveys to the mind a strange idea of insecurity , which hours of reflection would never create			1
" the @entity12 , with @entity6 aboard , reached @entity18 on march 4			1
the devastation there was appalling			0
@entity6 called it " the most awful yet interesting spectacle i ever beheld			2
" the entire city lay in ruins			0
the cathedral was shattered and wreckage and debris lined the coast			0
@entity6 spent the next weeks investigating the effects of the earthquake			1
he found that rocks lined with recent marine shells were now elevated above the tide			0
the island of @entity74 was raised an average of about 3 meters ( 9 feet )			0
combining his own observations with those of many local people , @entity6 attempted to reconstruct the event and to understand why it had occurred			2
he found that three volcanoes had erupted along the @entity1 coast at about the same time as the earthquake			1
not only did he collect widespread evidence of the uplift of the coast during the earthquake , but traveling inland and into the mountains , he discovered a series of remains of marine shells -- proof that the shifting that had recently uplifted the coast by a small amount had occurred over and over in the recent geological past			0
the experience convinced him that the great geologist @entity96 was right -- mountain chains were not created by sudden immense catastrophes , but grew almost imperceptibly , the product of thousands of successive uplifts over almost endless geological time			0
even more ambitiously , @entity6 later came to connect earthquakes , volcanoes and vertical movements of the @entity105 's crust as the results of same great unknown subterranean phenomena			1
in an ambitious and important scientific paper published after the voyage , @entity6 concluded that " this large portion of the earth 's crust floats in a like manner on a sea of molten rock " and indeed that it was likely this was true of " the entire globe			1
" this firsthand appreciation of an ever - changing surface of the @entity105 , over endless eons of time , was one of the major influences leading @entity6 to ask how it was that living things changed in order to adapt to an ever - changing world			1
his answer was , of course , evolution , or that new species are the genealogical descendants of earlier ones , adapted according to natural selection to the environment and each other			0
the recent tragic earthquake in @entity1 demonstrates , as @entity6 knew well , that our @entity105 is not static , it is still changing , still evolving			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity141 .			2

saturday 's earthquake was similar to one that struck @entity1 when @entity6 visited
@entity141 says @entity6 's theories were shaped in part by the experience of the quake
he says @entity6 observed that the quake elevated the @entity1 *coastline*
it prompted him to ask how life changed to adapt to a changing world , van @entity141 says
