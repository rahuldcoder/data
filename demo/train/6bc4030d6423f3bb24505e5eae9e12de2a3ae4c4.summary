-- in the wake of massive anti-government protests , @entity2 president @entity1 proposed a referendum as a way to place political reform in the public 's hands			1
the past weeks have seen the biggest demonstrations in decades , with tens of thousands taking to the streets in cities across the country			0
the protests started with outrage over a public transportation fare hike , but quickly ballooned to encompass a number of grievances against the government			0
@entity1 on monday responded directly to some of the protesters ' demands , outlining five " pacts " on social issues			1
among those was a proposal for a referendum " to make the political reforms that the country needs , " she said			1
a fair @entity31 deal for @entity2 ? the message the government is hearing from protesters is that they want more change faster , @entity1 said			1
" the streets are telling us that the country wants quality public services ; that they want more efficient mechanisms to fight corruption that ensure the proper use of public money ; that they want political representation that permeates a society where , as i said before , citizenship -- and not economic power -- is put first and foremost , " she said			2
she spoke at a meeting with governors and mayors			0
her other recommendations : -- fiscal responsibility with an emphasis on inflation control and economic stability			0
-- acceleration of investment in health care , including money for hospitals and health clinics , incentives for doctors to practice in needy areas , and the hiring of foreign doctors where shortages exist			2
-- public transportation improvements to the tune of 50 billion reals ( @entity72 $ 22 billion ) , new infrastructure , and a national council on transportation			0
-- boost public education by asking @entity77 to set aside 100 % of oil revenues for schools			2
these proposals align with the most common refrains heard during the protests -- that money is squandered instead of being used to improve the situation of @entity2			1
" together with the people we can solve large problems , " @entity1 said			1
" there is no reason to be inert , complacent or divided			0
" opinion : broken promises and corruption fuel protests many state governments had already reversed the fare hikes that had spurred the protests , but doing so did not slow the protests			0
the president has supported the protests as an expression of free speech , but has warned against the sporadic acts of looting and violence that have been recorded			0
on monday , @entity1 met with representatives of the @entity104 from @entity105			2
it was her first meeting with protest leaders .			1
