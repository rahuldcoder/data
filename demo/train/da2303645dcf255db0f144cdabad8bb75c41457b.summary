@entity0 -- a task force made up of local and federal law enforcement agencies is actively pursuing leads into the 1997 slaying of hip hop artist @entity6 , better known as @entity6 or @entity6 , according to two sources familiar with the investigation			1
according to one law enforcement source , the investigation into the 13 - year - old unsolved case was " reinvigorated " months ago as a result of new information , but the source would not elaborate further because of the ongoing investigation that includes the @entity16 , @entity18 district attorney 's office and the @entity19			1
on march 9 , 1997 , @entity6 , 24 , was shot and killed while riding in a @entity20 that was driving away from a music industry party at the @entity23 in @entity0			1
@entity0 police said a lone gunman in a @entity26 pulled alongside the @entity20 and opened fire on @entity6 , who was in the passenger seat			1
witnesses described the suspect as being an @entity32 man wearing a suit and bow tie			2
the main theory behind shooting was payback in a so - called rap war between @entity39 and @entity40 hip hop artists and their record companies - @entity42 in @entity43 , which represented @entity6 , and @entity44 , headed by @entity45 , in @entity0			1
six months earlier in @entity47 , a gunman opened fire on a car driven by @entity45 , killing one of his top artists @entity52			0
that murder remains unsolved also			2
" @entity57 was @entity6 , @entity40 was @entity52 , " @entity6 's mother @entity54 told a filmmaker in the 2002 documentary " @entity6 and @entity52			1
" " come on now , you 're messing with lives here and that 's exactly what happened			0
two lives were lost as a result of what ? stupidity ? " @entity54 told the filmmaker			0
retired @entity0 police detective @entity67 , who worked on the @entity6 case , told @entity1 that he believes @entity45 was behind the murder , even though the @entity44 ' boss was serving time on a probation violation at the time			1
" @entity45 ordered the hit , " @entity67 said , adding that he believes it was arranged by @entity75 , who headed security for @entity44			0
@entity75 told @entity1 he had nothing to do with the murder , and @entity45 has repeatedly said he had nothing to do with the crime			0
@entity67 said he retired early from the @entity16 , in part , because he was thwarted in following leads in the @entity6 case involving police officers , some of whom worked off - duty for @entity44			1
" i think i was getting too close to the truth , " @entity67 said			0
" i think they feared that the truth would be a scandal			0
" one of the officers @entity67 said was involved is @entity92 , who was sent to prison for robbing a bank in 1997 , the same year @entity6 was killed			1
@entity67 said @entity92 owned the same type of car driven by the gunman who shot @entity6 , and @entity67 said a friend of @entity92 's resembles a police sketch of the shooter			1
@entity1 was unable to reach @entity92 for comment , but when allegations of his involvement in @entity6 ' slaying originally surfaced more than a decade ago , his criminal defense attorney @entity101 called the claims ridiculous			2
@entity67 also assisted @entity6 's family in their wrongful death lawsuit against the @entity16 alleging a cover - up in the investigation			2
@entity0 city councilman @entity112 was the chief of police when @entity67 was investigating , and he told @entity1 the accusations about a police cover - up are " absurd			0
" " we would have never ignored a lead that could have helped us solve that murder , " @entity112 said			0
@entity120 , @entity54 's attorney , told @entity1 the family 's lawsuit , which was originally filed in 2002 , was put on hold in april after @entity0 police said turning over evidence from the case would interfere with a beefed up investigation			2
@entity92 was released from federal prison on may 14			0
