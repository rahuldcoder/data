the psychological profile that is emerging of this man is not rare			1
in fact , although @entity4 may be a more extreme example , there are aspects of his alleged pathology that are all too common			1
what i mean by the first item is that the clues to understanding @entity4 is to look at the totality of his adult functioning , and to look at his developmental years growing up			1

we have only fragmentary evidence at this point , but many details will emerge in the coming days and weeks			0
and while it 's impossible to psychoanalyze someone from a distance , there are plenty of clues in this case			0
we have reports that @entity4 was violent towards his common - in - law wife , @entity47 , with whom he had three children			1
she reported to police that @entity4 " broken petitioner 's nose ( twice ) , ribs , lacerations , knocked out tooth , blood clot on brain , ( inoperable tumor ) , dislocated shoulder , ( twice , once on each side ) threatened to kill petitioner and daughters 3 to 4 times just this year			1
" timeline : three @entity65 girls go missing the domestic violence protection order , filed on august 29 , 2005 , alleged that though @entity69 had full custody of their children , @entity4 , " frequently abducts daughters and keeps them from mother / petitioner / legal custodian			1
" of note , at the time @entity4 has this @entity73 filed against him is after he is alleged to have kidnapped his three victims and while he has them imprisoned			1
men ( who constitute 90 % the cases ) who are bent on the total control of a woman , using psychological and physical abuse , are termed batterers			2
read more : inside @entity65 's haunted house the dimensions along which male batterers have been studied include the presence or absence of alcohol or drug abuse , whether or not the violence is intrafamilial or extends outside the family , the presence or absence of criminality , and the presence or absence of psychopathology , especially personality disorders			0
in @entity4 's case it may be as he got older , he progressed from predominantly intrafamilial violence to kidnapping adolescent girls whom he controlled through systematic physical and sexual violence			1
we do n't know yet if drug or alcohol abuse played a role in promoting violent behaviors			0
but sociopathy appears to explain some of @entity4 's psychology			1
he seemed to have the sociopathic " charm " to drive up to adolescent females on the street and convince them to get into his car			2
read more : @entity115 feels ' fooled ' by @entity65 abduction suspect he had the sociopathic instincts of how to psychologically terrorize , demoralize , and " break down " his victims with beatings chainings , rapes , and basement imprisonment			1
he seemed adept at the psychological torture of allowing his prisoners to watch city vigils highlighting their disappearances			2
he participated in these gatherings and vigils and even interacted with one of the victim 's family members			0
his seeming ability to maintain a detached demeanor while present in the community suggests antisocial personality			0
so besides the concepts of batterers and sociopathy , what is striking in @entity4 's case is the degree of sexual sadism			1
unfortunately , the systematic physical and sexual violence extending for years towards one 's children , step - children , or spouse is something i hear every day in the histories of my patients admitted for treatment of severe alcohol or drug addiction			2
case law records prosecutions of men charged with kidnapping women for hours or days at a time to sexually abuse them			0
but what is mindboggling in @entity4 's case is the breadth and depth of sexual violence he is accused of perpetrating against these three women			1
if he is charged for every assault and rape his victims report , he could receive thousands of charges			2
where do people like @entity4 come from ? male batterers often grow up in families fraught with strife , conflict , neglect and violence			1
the basic theory is that deleterious early life experiences of the perpetrator cause developmental arrest of their psychological maturation and personality formation			0
this theory would predict that in the coming weeks and months details will emerge of the events in his early years that derailed @entity4 being able to develop a normal , healthy , mature adult ego			2
what happens is that the individual is left with deep emotional needs for which they feel totally inadequate to get met			0
their self - concept is so impaired and their self - esteem is chronically so low that they feel totally unable to compete in the normal adult game of attracting and keeping a mate			0
when their attempts are met by failure , their impaired moral development and lack of empathy coupled with unbridled anger and rage lead them down the road of violent possession of their " partners			0
" but even battering , sociopathy , and sexual sadism do not seem enough to explain the enormity of @entity4 's alleged crimes towards these three women			1
in fact , they suggest a more pervasive pathology such as a sadistic personality disorder -- currently a research category			0
his alleged violence towards vulnerable women was so extensive , repeated over so many years , extended beyond sexual violence and perversions , to alleged forced miscarriages , starvation , and other forms of behavioral control			0
we will need to brace ourselves as the investigations unfold and the true extent of the horrors that were committed at 2207 @entity231 is revealed			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			2

a *psychiatrist* says the psychological profile emerging of @entity4 is not rare
@entity234 : battering , sociopathy , and sexual sadism do not seem enough to explain the crimes
@entity4 had the ' sociopathic instincts of how to terrorize and demoralize his victims '
