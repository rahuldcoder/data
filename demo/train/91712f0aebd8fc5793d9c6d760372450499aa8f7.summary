@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity4 's 2012 campaign is gradually starting to take shape			1
rather than focusing on the record from his first term and his competence as the commander in chief , the president is promoting himself as a revived populist , anti-establishment @entity12 fighting for the unfulfilled goals of his 2008 campaign			1
referring to the announcement that @entity17 would charge a debit card fee , the president argued that this justified the need for a consumer bureau			2
" you can stop it , " he said			0
" you do n't have some inherent right just to , you know , get a certain amount of profit , if your customers are being mistreated			0
" during a press conference , @entity4 expressed some support for the protests taking place on @entity34			1
the protest " expresses frustrations @entity37 people feel , " he said			0
through statements such as these , the president hopes to recapture some of the energy that fueled his dramatic run for the @entity44			1
in some ways , @entity4 is looking back to president @entity47 's 1948 campaign against @entity49 @entity48			1
in a stunning come - from - behind campaign , where most of the pollsters were wrong in their predictions , @entity47 railed against the " @entity54 " and appealed to core @entity56 constituencies such as organized labor to win re-election			0
but this style of campaign poses many risks to the president in 2012			0
@entity4 does not have the same kind of huge foreign policy record that helped @entity47 neutralize the @entity49 in 1948 , a campaign that came one year after the @entity66 and the same year as the @entity67			1
yes , @entity68 was killed and @entity69 was ousted during @entity4 's presidency			1
but @entity47 presided over the end of @entity72 and was the president who oversaw the shaping of @entity37 's containment policies to combat international communism			1
foreign policy also loomed much larger in the minds of voters as the @entity80 was taking shape ; today the war on unemployment has overtaken the war on terrorism in the public mind			0
rather than repeating the election of 1948 , @entity4 could end up facing some of the problems encountered by president @entity89 in 1980 or , in a different context , vice president @entity91 in 2000			1
a populist , anti-washington campaign is at odds with the @entity4 whom the nation has seen up close since january 2009			1
while the president clearly shares many concerns with the left wing of the party , it 's also clear that he is much more comfortable staying close to the center			2
he governs much more like president @entity101 than one might have expected from his 2008 primary campaign			0
@entity4 is a pragmatist and a politician , less concerned about ideological purity than about political outcomes			2
the president 's relationship with the left has been extremely tense			2
during a series of legislative battles , including the one over health care reform , @entity4 kept his distance from the base of his party in an effort to find legislation that could win over the handful of centrists in his own party and the @entity49			2
some members of his administration , including former press secretary @entity123 , have made tough statements about the need for liberals to be more realistic about their goals			0
unlike @entity47 , who had his own problems with the left , @entity4 can not point to a huge record from his party of successful policies that have bolstered the security of @entity37 's middle class			1
when @entity47 ran in 1948 , @entity135 and the @entity136 were still fresh on the minds of most voters			0
the danger with running too strongly as a populist is that it can quickly appear disingenuous			0
if @entity4 pushes too hard on the populist theme , he could sound a bit like @entity91 in 2000 , who fell flat -- after years of standing as a voice of centrism -- when he railed against the wealthy			1
in certain respects , @entity4 's efforts to win over the left could backfire , causing activists to feel that they are being used rather than being given an honest choice about whom they would rather have in office -- a @entity12 who compromises or a @entity49 who will be under immense pressure from the tea party			1
to be sure , the liberal base wo n't vote for @entity157 or @entity158			0
but many could decide not to vote at all			0
another problem with @entity4 's emerging strategy is that the @entity162 campaign would be hard to pull off			1
when @entity47 turned to this theme in 1948 , @entity54 was under @entity49 control			0
the nation had divided government , not a divided @entity54 , which is currently the case with a @entity56 - controlled @entity168 and a @entity49 @entity44			0
when @entity4 lashes out against @entity54 he is taking shots at his fellow @entity12 , senate majority leader @entity170 , not just at house speaker @entity171			2
voters will have trouble seeing how one party is to blame for the performance of @entity54 when neither party controls everything			0
moreover , it is harder to run an anti-establishment campaign when you are the face of @entity181			0
@entity89 learned this in 1980			0
the heart of @entity89 's campaign in 1976 had been to clean up government and regain the trust of voters who were disillusioned with @entity181 as a result of @entity189			2
when @entity89 ran in 1980 , he could n't pull off the @entity191 stance			0
like @entity4 , @entity89 was no longer a fresh voice and he was deeply tied to events in @entity181			2
if @entity4 is too tough on the political establishment , it is possible that some moderate and independent voters might very well agree with his analysis of the problem , but then decide to vote for the @entity49 nominee who does not carry the same kind of baggage from the capital			1
the final challenge for @entity4 is that the focus on anti-government populism will prevent him , or dissuade him , from talking about his legislative accomplishments			1
in the end , most of the presidents who have successfully run for re-election have defended and championed what they accomplished in @entity181			2
they explained to the voters how they improved the nation			0
until now , republicans have been able to control the narrative of @entity4 's presidency			1
they have depicted everything he has done -- from the stimulus to financial regulation -- as ineffective , and they are now developing an argument that he is not only failing to fix the economy but responsible for the worsening of the situation			0
at some level , @entity4 needs to explain to voters what he has done and how he has strengthened the nation -- even in difficult economic times			1
if he simply ignores his own record and allows @entity49 to define what happened in his first four years , he risks leaving himself open to a tough attack from his opponents			0
president @entity4 must be true to the kind of @entity12 he has been -- not trying to reinvent himself in a media culture that constantly reminds voters of who he really is -- and he must define and champion the record that he has accomplished			1
if the president wants to persuade voters to support him , he has to convince them that his style of politics and his legislative record are the basis for four better years ahead			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			2

@entity249 : president @entity4 lately is sounding a populist *message*
he says the populism clashes with what we have seen in @entity4 's term
voters are n't likely to support @entity4 as an anti-washington force , @entity247 says
@entity247 : most presidents who have been re-elected have run on their records
