a @entity1 pilot has been charged with interfering with a flight crew after his midair behavioral meltdown led to an emergency landing			2
the federal criminal complaint reveals details of the incident in which @entity8 , 49 , displayed what passengers and fellow crew members described as erratic , bizarre and disturbing behavior			1
@entity8 has been suspended pending an investigation and is receiving medical treatment , the airline said wednesday			1
if convicted , @entity8 would face a maximum 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine			1
the @entity19 attorney 's office has 30 days to present the matter to a grand jury for indictment			2
read the criminal complaint in the two - page affidavit in support of an arrest warrant , @entity25 special agent @entity24 said @entity8 missed the crew briefing for flight 191 , which departed at 7:28 a.m. tuesday from @entity32 's @entity31 en route to @entity34			1
" initially , he did not exhibit any bizarre behavior , " @entity24 said in the affidavit , which describes behavior that grew more erratic as the flight continued			1
the affidavit details the trip : as the plane was taking off , @entity8 " said something to the @entity42 ( first officer ) about being evaluated by someone , " but the first officer was not sure what @entity8 meant			1
@entity8 talked about his church and needing to " focus , " then asked the first officer to take over the controls and the radio			1
@entity8 said , " things just do n't matter , " talked about sins in @entity34 , and at one point said , " we 're not going to @entity34			1
" about 3Â½ hours into the planned five - hour flight , the pilot left the cockpit to use the lavatory , but he failed to follow security protocol , alarming the crew			2
he then banged on the lavatory door and told the female passenger inside that he needed to go to the bathroom			0
by that time , the first officer had summoned another @entity1 pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside			2
from the cabin , @entity8 tried to enter his security code to gain access to the cockpit " and he banged on the door hard enough that the @entity42 thought he was coming through the door			1
" but the door held and , over the @entity77 , the first officer ordered passengers to restrain @entity8			1
several did just that , subduing the pilot in the forward galley			2
during the melee , a flight attendant suffered bruised ribs			0
a passenger said @entity8 said , " pray f * * * ing now for @entity86 " and mumbled about @entity86 , september 11 , @entity87 , @entity88 and terrorists			1
how are flight crews screened ? " the pilot ran to the cockpit door , began banging on it and said something to the effect of , ' we 've got ta pull the throttle back			2
we 've got ta get this plane down , ' " said passenger @entity98 , a former @entity99 anchor			0
" at that point , the two flight attendants tried to subdue him , and then -- seemingly out of nowhere -- about six or seven large guys stormed to the front of the plane and wrestled the captain of the plane down to the ground and had him subdued in a matter of moments , " she said			0
" it was really like something out of a movie			0
" amateur video of the incident showed a commotion as men moved through the aisle			0
a voice , purportedly that of the pilot , can be heard			2
i 'm so distraught ! " he shouts			0
" we 've got @entity127 , we 've got @entity87 , we 've got @entity127 , we 've got @entity87 ! we 've got to get down ! " law enforcement met the aircraft , cuffed the pilot and took him off the plane			2
if that description of @entity8 's behavior is correct , " this guy was clearly psychotic , " said dr. @entity134 , a professor of psychiatry at @entity136 who has not treated @entity8			1
" that has all the earmarks of an acute psychotic episode			2
i would n't hesitate to make that statement			0
" psychosis is an automatic disqualification from flying , said @entity134 , who is himself a pilot , was a flight surgeon at the @entity148 and has consulted for the @entity149 , the @entity150 and a number of airlines			2
cases of psychosis among pilots are unusual , but not rare , and can be career - ending , he said			1
" pretty much , their career is done , most of them , " he said			1
" it 's a lifetime disqualification for obvious reasons ... you have to be able to trust each other and you have to be able to trust that the airman is going to be able to perform in a reasonable way			2
" passenger @entity165 praised the co-pilot			0
" he really , i think , is the hero here because he had the sense to recognize that something was going horribly wrong , and he was able to persuade the pilot out of the cockpit , " he said			0
the first officer declared an emergency and the plane landed at about 11 a.m. in @entity175 , @entity176			0
passengers restraining @entity8 continued to do so during the landing			1
@entity8 , who has worked as a @entity1 pilot for 12 years , has been taken off active duty with pay , said airline spokeswoman @entity182			1
ceo @entity183 said @entity8 had always been a " consummate professional			1
" " what happened at altitude is we had a medical situation , " @entity183 told @entity184			0
" it became a security situation			0
" @entity183 said the captain was in custody of the @entity25			1
citing privacy concerns , @entity1 would not divulge details about his treatment			0
@entity8 has not made a public statement			1

a facebook page for a @entity8 says he is married and lives in @entity216 , @entity217			1

" @entity8 lives with his wife of six years , @entity224 , and enough animals to make a lint - brush essential , " the story says			1
@entity8 " wants to be a motivational speaker down the road , " the story says			2

" i was surprised , to say the least , " @entity242 , who wrote the profile , said about her reaction when she heard the news tuesday			0
she said she had met with the pilot three times in preparing to write the story and that he gave no indication that anything was amiss			0
" he was fantastic , and i believe he probably still is			0
i 'm as eager as everybody else to figure out what happened			0
but he was a gregarious guy , he was confident and he seemed happy			0
i ca n't say that anything led me to think that something like this would happen			0
