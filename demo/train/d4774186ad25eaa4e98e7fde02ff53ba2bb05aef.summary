@entity0 -- the fragile @entity4 - @entity3 relationship -- already frayed by disagreements over @entity6 , @entity7 and nuclear arms -- showed another sign of strain sunday , as @entity4 lawmakers blasted the country 's president @entity12 for allowing @entity15 leaker @entity14 to land in @entity16 while evading @entity4 espionage charges			1
@entity14 , who has admitted leaking top - secret information about government surveillance programs , left @entity20 on sunday and later touched down in @entity16 , according to @entity21 , which helped him travel			1
while @entity3 is not believed to be his final destination -- @entity24 's prime minister said @entity14 applied for asylum in his country -- lawmakers on sunday were quick to fault @entity12 for harboring a man the @entity4 government desperately wants back			1
" @entity12 always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the @entity4 , whether it is @entity6 , @entity7 , and now , of course , with @entity14 , " sen. @entity30 said on @entity1 's @entity31			1
" that 's not how allies should treat one another , and i think it will have serious consequences for the @entity4 - @entity3 relationship			1
" that relationship was already showing signs of strain at last week 's @entity45 conference in @entity46 , where global leaders pressured @entity12 on his country 's support of @entity6 president @entity50 , which extends back to the @entity52 and @entity50 's father			0
at a joint appearance that followed a bilateral meeting last week , @entity12 and president @entity54 were tense and unsmiling and offered no indication their deep disagreements about the way forward in war - torn @entity6 were any closer to being resolved			0
why would @entity14 head for @entity24 ? later in the week , @entity54 publicly pressured @entity3 to join the @entity4 in slashing its supply of nuclear weapons , saying both nations needed to " move beyond @entity52 nuclear postures			1
" @entity54 delivered his remarks at the @entity68 in @entity69 , which for decades symbolized the @entity71 divide			0
on sunday , however , the divide between the @entity4 and @entity3 persisted			2
@entity30 , a @entity74 @entity73 , suggested on @entity1 that @entity12 personally approved @entity14 's landing in @entity16 on sunday			1
" very few are the areas in which he does cooperate ( with the @entity4 ) these days			0
i think this action , @entity12 allowing @entity14 to land in @entity3 and then go somewhere else , is going to have serious consequences for the @entity4 - @entity3 relationship , " @entity30 said			1
his characterization of @entity3 's stance was echoed by @entity83 sen. @entity82 , an infrequent ally of @entity30 's , who spoke on " @entity84			1
" " i hope we 'll chase him to the ends of the earth , bring him to justice and let the @entity3 know there will be consequences if they harbor this guy , " said @entity82 , who represents @entity85			2
" they want to be part of the world community , the ( @entity94 )			0
they want a good relationship with the @entity4			0
they should hold this felon and send him back home for justice , " @entity82 said			0
@entity3 joined the @entity94 last august after nearly two decades of negotiations			2
before being admitted , it was the largest economy not represented at the global trade body			0
as lawmakers spoke sunday , it remained unclear where @entity14 's final destination would be , though he was not expected to remain in @entity3			1
@entity14 's @entity4 passport has been revoked , according to a source familiar with the matter , setting up any travel out of @entity3 to become a major diplomatic flashpoint			1
" persons wanted on felony charges , such as mr. @entity14 , should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel , other than is necessary to return him to the @entity4 , " @entity113 spokeswoman @entity112 said in a statement			2
earlier in june , @entity12 's spokesman @entity118 said @entity3 would consider a request for political asylum from @entity14 , but that such a request from the @entity15 leaker had not yet been made			1
@entity118 , in an indication of the @entity125 's stance , also wrote on @entity126 , " the @entity4 security services were breaking the laws of their country by tapping phone calls and conducting internet surveillance			0
" @entity21 ' @entity132 urges support for @entity14 , slams @entity54 " @entity14 , same as @entity132 , is a human rights activist , " he continued , referring to @entity21 founder @entity132 , currently holed up at the @entity134 in @entity135 , where he 's been granted asylum			1
asked sunday whether he believed @entity12 had advance knowledge of @entity14 's travel plans , rep. @entity139 , the @entity83 chairman of the @entity140 , said , " that would n't surprise me			2
" " @entity3 is a country that wants to get back on the world stage , and i do n't think they really care if they do it in a way that 's in the best interest of good citizenship around the world , " @entity139 said on @entity143 's " @entity142 , " citing @entity12 's stance on @entity6 and nuclear disarmament			2
" i 'm sure they would love to have a little coffee and a few conversations with mr. @entity14 , " continued the @entity153 @entity83 , referring to the @entity3			1
" that 's why this is so serious and why we need to be so aggressive in making sure that people understand the difference between somebody who betrays their country and gives secrets away that will protect @entity4 lives at the expense of whatever he hopes to gain in the company of the @entity3			2
" @entity139 ' remarks underscored the debate between those who believe @entity14 committed an act of treason and those who view him as a hero promoting greater government transparency			1
the debate has created unlikely alliances in @entity0 , where some @entity180 find themselves on the same side as @entity83 -- and opposite their base -- in calling for @entity14 's arrest			1
an empty debate ? why little will happen to change how we snoop rep. @entity186 , the @entity187 , was loudly booed and heckled at a conference of progressives saturday when she asserted @entity14 had broken the law			2
earlier , she drew a distinction between lawmakers like herself , who oversee the nation 's security , and privacy - minded citizens			0
" i know that some of you attribute heroic status to that action , " she said , referring to @entity14 's leaks			2
" but , again , you do n't have the responsibility for the security of the @entity4			0
those of us who do have to strike a different balance			0
" " i do n't think this man is a whistle - blower , " another @entity209 @entity73 , sen. @entity210 , said on @entity212 ' " @entity211			0
" " whatever his motives are , and i take him at face value , he could have stayed and faced the music			0
i do n't think running is a noble thought			0
" that view was countered by sen. @entity222 , a libertarian - minded @entity223 @entity83 who has been one of the few @entity4 lawmakers to praise @entity14			1
while he warned @entity14 would be discredited if he " cozies up to the @entity3 government , " @entity222 suggested the former @entity227 employee had lived up to his duty as a citizen by exposing what he felt were government misdeeds			1
" i would say that mr. @entity14 has n't lied to anyone			0
he did break his oath of office , but part of his oath of office is to the @entity240 , " @entity222 said on @entity1 , adding : " he was simply coming forward and telling the truth -- that your government was lying			0
" @entity54 takes @entity15 controversy to nascent watchdog group			0

lawmakers blast @entity3 for allowing @entity14 to land in @entity16
' that 's not how allies should treat one another , ' says sen. @entity30
debate persists over whether @entity14 is a hero or a traitor
