@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a deserted playground a few hundred miles south of @entity5 , 13 - year - old @entity3 fiddles with a broken rusted slide			1
she is waiting listlessly for a lesson with her math tutor			2
the bright - eyed teenager lives in a sepia - toned village in the province of @entity0 , a place of rural poverty and neglect			1
but she has big dreams about education			1
she wants to open a school one day			2
" at my school , we 'll learn , " she says , brushing her hands longingly over the slide			2
" teachers will show up and we 'll be allowed to ask questions			2
we 'll be allowed to draw with color			2
" such aspirations , however , amount to fantasy for most youth in a country still struggling to land on its feet after being turned completely upside down			2
two and a half years after the country 's uprising began , @entity1 's fledgling democracy is stillborn , stubbornly stuck between its past and future			1
and as the government struggles to wade through the country 's protracted political problems , @entity1 's festering education system is orphaned -- even though , with a growing youth population , it 's key to the country 's future			1
in the @entity45 's latest report on global competitiveness , @entity1 ranked near the bottom -- 131st out of 144 countries -- for quality of primary education			1
@entity1 's literacy rate is 66 % , according to a 2011 @entity53 report			1
meanwhile , a report by @entity55 think tank @entity56 says just $ 129 a year is spent on each @entity58 student ; the @entity60 , for example , spends 40 times as much			2
the situation is worst in regions far from the capital , and in @entity1 , where more than half the population is under 29			1
many schools look more like rank penitentiaries rather than hubs of learning			0
students and teachers seem to be on the verge of exhaustion rather than bursting with inspiration			0
desks and a stable electricity supply are luxuries			0
" we did n't have enough desks last year , " recalls @entity3 's 12 - year - old neighbor , @entity80			1
" so most of us just sat on the floor			0
we only get a little paper , but my mom found this , " she said , holding up a small , faded " @entity85 " notebook			0
the @entity90 reference is lost on her			0
to make up for the gaps in education , millions of middle - class @entity58 families spend a large part of their income -- sometimes as much as 25 % -- on private tutoring			1
it 's impossible to know how much money is spent in all , but some estimates put the total at $ 1 billion a year			0
public school teachers rarely make more than $ 300 a month			0
more than a few of them say they teach the bare minimum in class so that they can earn more from the same students in private tutoring sessions			1
" there are too many issues to deal with , " said one 32 - year - old teacher in @entity3 's village			1
" i have kids of my own i 'm struggling to take care for			0
" he says he gives three hours of private tutoring in the evening and does mechanical work on the side			1
for parents with any hope that their children will be better off , investing in education is essential			1
@entity1 's final secondary school exams are a rite of passage for students			1
their scores chart their future			0
if they do n't do well , they wo n't get a place in college			0
the status quo is even more somber for @entity1 's women			1
according to a recent @entity138 report , the illiteracy rate for young people in @entity1 is 17 % , higher than the national average of 11 % , and the illiteracy rates for females is 24 % , almost twice that of males			1
also , 70 % of young women in @entity1 are jobless			1
more : interactive -- impossible odds , unstoppable girls politicians , whether they 're from the ruling @entity149 or the opposition , agree that educational reform is needed			0
but they quickly fall silent when pushed to articulate plans			0
one politician said the country simply has " bigger fish to fry , " with a controversial new constitution and still no full , functioning parliament			0
but with unemployment at staggering rates -- 33 % for men age 20 - 24 and 53 % for women in the same age -- @entity1 has a highly combustible pool of frustrated and disenfranchised youth in danger of becoming a lost generation			1
" this is a generation that desperately needs to learn how to critically think , to learn how to be in the 21st century , " said @entity167 , director of the @entity168 at the @entity169			0
" @entity172 's regime trained students to be loyal citizens			0
and now , despite a revolution for dignity ... there is none			0
" it sounds like an almost hopeless picture			0
however , as @entity1 's public education system founders , a few innovative ideas have emerged			1
this year , a few @entity58 entrepreneurs have launched @entity184 , a web - based startup that features crowd - sourced educational videos			1
@entity184 , which means " we understand " in @entity188 , hopes to provide an alternative -- a virtual classroom -- for struggling @entity58 families			1
it divides the @entity58 public school curriculum into lessons that can be explained in 5 - to 15 - minute videos , covering all lessons mandated by the government curriculum			2
since the website went live in october , @entity184 's staff of teachers created around 4,900 videos , while 1,000 videos were crowd - sourced -- reviewed and approved by the staff			2
by late may , @entity184 's @entity205 channel had more than 1 million views			0
for the 65 % of @entity58 who do n't have internet access -- those who stand to gain the most from the service -- @entity210 says it hopes to form group viewings in some villages			0
it is also in talks with some companies to offer @entity217 with internet access to groups throughout the countryside			2
another innovative initiative is @entity222 , a start - up created by @entity224 , a 24 - year - old @entity58 who 's a graduate student at @entity226 in @entity227			1
based on the @entity230 model , @entity228 plans to recruit ambitious college graduates -- most from within the @entity58 community and diaspora -- to commit to a two - year service in which they are trained extensively and placed in underprivileged schools			2
@entity228 says she 's running into problems , however , while trying to implement her idea			2
the bureaucracy in @entity1 leaves little room for productivity , let alone creativity and innovation			1
still , she continues to push on			0
" we could all stand around and protest that the government is failing us , or we could go out and offer the solutions , " she said			0
" so , that 's what we 're trying to do			0
" but until those solutions are offered , @entity3 -- and a whole generation in waiting -- will continue to linger near broken slides , daydreaming about the future			0
more : @entity2 's " @entity254 " interactive : impossible odds , unstoppable girls open letter from @entity259 : it 's time to power the world how to help take action with 10x10			0

while @entity1 struggles to wade through political problems , its education system suffers
literacy rates are low and unemployment is high , especially among females
many middle - class families are spending a large part of their income on private tutoring
a few start - up companies have emerged , however , to address the education *deficit*
