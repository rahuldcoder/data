what is being called the nation 's toughest anti-abortion measure -- a law that bans most abortions after six weeks , when a fetal heartbeat can be first detected -- was signed into law on tuesday by @entity8 's governor			1
the law sets the stage for an almost guaranteed legal showdown , with proponents saying the law is intended to test the 1973 @entity16 @entity15 ruling that made abortion legal			1
" although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question , this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of @entity28 , " gov. @entity18 said in a statement			1
the governor directed the legislature to set aside funds to cover the cost of the expected legal battle , which opponents vowed to mount if the governor signed the measure into law			0
" @entity8 's governor today effectively banned abortion in the state , with an outrageous and unconstitutional law that will not stand , " said @entity37 , president of the @entity38			2

the @entity47 announced plans late tuesday to file a lawsuit to challenge the new law			1
" we will not allow this frontal assault on fundamental reproductive rights to go unchallenged , " @entity51 , the president of the @entity47 said			2
while the law does not spell out a specific time frame when a fetal heartbeat can be detected , experts say it is typically six to seven weeks into a pregnancy			1
the new law targets doctors rather than women having an abortion , with a maximum punishment of five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine			0

abortion was legalized in all 50 states in 1973 by the @entity16 @entity15			0
statutory time limits on when abortions can take place , however , vary from state to state			2
under @entity28 , abortions are generally permitted until the fetus is considered viable , or able to live outside the womb			1
some states have no time limit , while others allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester , about 27 or 28 weeks into the pregnancy			0
@entity8 's fetal heartbeat law was one of three laws targeting abortion that @entity18 signed on tuesday			1
the other laws are : -- a ban on the procedure on the basis of genetic defects or gender selections			0
-- a requirement that doctors who perform abortions have privileges at a @entity8 - area hospital			0
while proponents say the law will protect the welfare of a woman undergoing a medical procedure , opponents say it will force the closure of @entity8 's only clinic that performs abortions			2

the @entity47 and the @entity143 have vowed to challenge the law in federal court			1
called the @entity147 , the bill requires testing to determine " whether the fetus that the pregnant woman is carrying possesses a detectible heartbeat			0
