-- hear that ? over the whirring drone of the cogs of industry , the grinding of the tectonic plates , the gentle flap - flap - flapping of a legion of butterfly wings -- all indications of a world still turning -- comes the gentle weeping of the heart - wrenched masses , mourning the fact that they are utterly and completely alone			1
a fact that will be rubbed in -- like so much paprika in a cannibal victim 's wound -- during that one day per year next week when love and being loved matters the most ( @entity23 )			0
since we write for a media outlet , it 's basically etched into our blood - lettered contract that we address that day of days in some kind of thematic way			2
however , instead of helping you all stave off the crushing wave of loneliness that 's threatening to crest on the 14th , we 're just going to highlight some of the weirdest love life - enhancing apps we 've encountered on our dusty travels			1
c'mon , you did n't want a relationship anyway -- drunken crying is so much more acceptable when enjoyed alone			0
how to lose friends and influence people you know those two friends -- the pair that is so obviously in love with each other but just ca n't quite get it together enough to date ? do n't you wish those crazy kids would stop ( playfully ) punching each other and ( playfully ) criticizing each other 's lifestyles and just get it on already ? well , thanks to @entity53 ( and @entity54 ) you can finally push your pals into the loving relationship that they so obviously long for			2
the drugstore chain is out with a super-subtle app called " @entity59 " that allows you to choose from a series of virtual photo frames emblazoned with phrases like " caution ! hot couple ! " and " why are n't @entity65 ? " and plug in those unsuspecting future lovebirds			1
finish off the virtual @entity68 with a gift suggestion for the pair -- like plush toys or @entity72 -- and post the whole thing to your @entity53 wall for all to see			2
for your noble labors , you will then be gifted with a coupon for something truly fabulous , like @entity80 cologne			0
want a restraining order for @entity85 ? it 's the most common of queries after a relationship goes sour : what went wrong ? a body can drive himself mad ruminating on such a question , which is why it 's usually the healthiest course of action to shove all that self - loathing deep , deep down into your entrails , hit the whiskey and just conclude that he or she is a hateful ... rhymes with " ick			2
" but what if you could know -- and we mean @entity106 -- beyond a shadow of a doubt why your former lover recoils from your very lingering touch ? enter : @entity110 , a brand - new service that allows you to send a virtual comment card to your ex asking , well , " ' @entity123 ' went wrong ? ' " both parties can offer each other constructive feedback on their positive and negative traits , and the dumper can tell the dumpee just why s / he did the dumping : " you do n't like pets , " " you drink too much , " " you 're married			1
" or , you know , " you send me weird , needy virtual comment cards			1
" screw fate , you have an iphone as myriad self - help books will tell you , you could find your soulmate anywhere ! the coffee shop down the street ! the bookstore ! the feminine hygiene aisle of the supermarket ! so chin up , chaps , turn that hideous frown upside down and always make sure you 're wearing your " nice " underwear			0
or , you know , take fate into your own hands and download @entity141			0
@entity142 is an @entity144 / @entity127 app that allows you to meet up with like - minded people as you go about your business each day			1
sign in via @entity53 , port your soul over into the app and start checking in to spots or broadcasting where you might go later			0
the app will then suggest people to meet at said places based on their interests , as well as places where people who share your interests hang out			1
if you see someone who strikes your fancy , you can then message or " shortlist them " ( the virtual equivalent of , " hey , @entity161 , will you tell @entity162 that i like her ? )			0
you 're staring vacantly at your cell , anyway , you might as well eke out some form of human interaction before your heart powers down .			0
