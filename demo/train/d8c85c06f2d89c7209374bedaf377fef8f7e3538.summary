the world 's most powerful democracy and the world 's most absolute monarchy have long been close , if unlikely , allies			0
they are bound together by common interests -- the free flow of oil and , more recently , fighting @entity9			0
that alliance was first sealed between president @entity11 and @entity13 @entity12 on february 14 , 1945 , when they met on the deck of the @entity16 as the @entity18 warship cruised in the @entity19			1
@entity11 and his advisors knew that oil , of which @entity13 was well endowed , was a key component of @entity18 's economy			1
indeed , @entity24 had signed a farsighted deal a decade earlier giving it exclusive production rights in @entity13			0
@entity27 , who has written authoritatively on @entity18 - @entity13 relations , writes that as result of the meeting on the @entity16 , the @entity18 president gave the @entity13 king a @entity34 airplane that was specially outfitted with a rotating throne that allowed the king always to face the holy site of @entity38 while he was in the air			2
for his part , @entity40 so enjoyed his meals as the president 's guest on board the @entity16 that he surprised his host with an unusual demand : he wanted to take the @entity16 's cook for himself			0
@entity11 was able to diplomatically ward off this request			0
( the concept that human beings are not personal property came to the @entity13 kingdom relatively late ; slavery was only abolished there in 1962			0
) for more than six decades after that important meeting on the @entity16 the @entity13 - @entity18 relationship has largely worked well for both countries			2
@entity13 is the world 's largest oil producer and sits on around a fifth of the world 's proven oil reserves and therefore it can set oil prices by increasing or lowering oil production			0
generally it has done so in ways that respect @entity18 interests			0
when the @entity13 really needed the @entity18 following @entity69 's 1990 invasion of their neighbor @entity72 , the @entity18 sent a half a million troops to the @entity75 to expel @entity69 's forces			2
the news that 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were @entity13 certainly put something of a dent in the @entity18 - @entity13 alliance , but the @entity83 administration had close ties to the @entity13 and matters were soon smoothed over , particularly after 2003 when @entity9 began staging attacks on @entity87 and oil facilities in the @entity13 kingdom , at which point the @entity13 launched an effective crackdown on the group			1
controversy stirs anew over @entity13 textbooks with @entity94 set to visit yet today , the @entity13 - @entity18 alliance has never been in worse shape			1
that is why on friday president @entity94 met with @entity13 @entity98 , one of the sons of @entity40 , in an attempt to patch things up			1
what went wrong ? in recent months the normally hyper - discreet @entity13 have gone on the record about their dissatisfactions with the @entity94 administration			2
in december , @entity106 , the former @entity13 intelligence chief and ambassador to @entity108 , took the highly unusual step of publicly criticizing the administration , " we 've seen several red lines put forward by the president , which went along and became pinkish as time grew , and eventually ended up completely white ... when that kind of assurance comes from a leader of a country like the @entity18 , we expect him to stand by it			1
" it 's inconceivable that @entity106 , whose brother is the @entity13 foreign minister , would make these public comments without approval from the highest levels of the @entity13 government			0
why are the @entity13 going public with their dissatisfaction with the @entity94 administration ? the laundry list of @entity13 complaints most recently is that the @entity18 did n't make good on its " red line " threat to take action against the @entity132 regime in @entity133 following its use of chemical weapons against its own population			1
@entity133 is a close ally of @entity13 's archrival , @entity140 , and the @entity13 are also growing apprehensive that the @entity18 will not take a firm line on @entity140 's nuclear program -- which the @entity13 see as an almost - existential threat -- now that the @entity18 - @entity140 relations have recently thawed			1
the @entity13 were also puzzled by the fact that the @entity94 administration seemed willing to let a longtime @entity18 ally , @entity147 dictator @entity146 , be thrown overboard during the " @entity148 " of early 2011			1
what did that say about other longtime @entity18 allies in the region ? ( interestingly , these list of gripes look quite similar to those of another powerful player in the @entity157 -- @entity158			0
) prince @entity159 , the powerful @entity13 minister of interior , was in @entity108 last month			0
according to a senior @entity13 official his discussions in @entity108 ahead of @entity94 's trip were all about @entity133			1
here @entity108 and @entity163 have a real common interest ; preventing the rise of @entity9 in @entity133			1
@entity13 made it a crime last month for its citizens to travel to fight in overseas conflicts such as the @entity133 civil war			2
those @entity13 who have gone to fight in @entity133 often join @entity9 - aligned groups			1
some 1,200 @entity13 have traveled to @entity133 , of whom 220 have returned to the kingdom , according to the senior @entity13 official			2
there is great concern in the kingdom about potential " blowback " caused by such militants who have obtained battlefield experience in @entity133			0
both the @entity18 and @entity13 have an interest in blocking @entity9 's growth in @entity133			1
@entity94 and @entity98 met on friday outside @entity163			0
after the meeting , a senior @entity18 official said that the @entity18 and @entity13 remain " very much aligned " despite recent policy differences over issues like @entity140 .			0

@entity18 has had alliance with @entity13 since 1945 ; @entity94 met @entity188 friday
@entity190 says the relationship is now at its lowest point
@entity13 are upset that @entity94 did n't stand by the " red line " he drew on @entity133
@entity196 : two nations share common ground in opposing @entity9 's rise in @entity133
