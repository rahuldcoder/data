-- if you 're not already celebrating at your local comic book store or glued to @entity4 's 10 - hour marathon of " @entity6 " re-runs , then maybe you do n't know			1
today is @entity8 ' 30th birthday			0
" @entity6 " has survived through one feature length film , a cult television series and a comic book			1
still a fan favorite and no stranger to controversy , @entity13 's influential franchise about a teenage girl who just happened to be naturally good at killing vampires is still inspiring fans			1
@entity8 's birthday is reason for them to celebrate			0
there was a moment in the episode " the gift , " which aired in 2001 , when fans certainly did n't think this powerful girl would make it to 30			0
that 's because @entity6 took a swan - dive into a magical vortex from hell and died			1
at the end of the episode her gravestone is shown , marking her life from 1981 until 2001 with the epitaph , " she saved the world a lot			0
" ( she was resurrected the next season , when the show moved from the now defunct @entity46 network to @entity47			1
) few who are aware of the " buffyverse " would argue with that			0
@entity8 saved the world from plenty of " big bads , " like vampires , demons and witches , but she did something pretty heroic for the people who tuned in every week to watch her adventures , too			0
" ( the show ) really brought a lot of nerdy girls out of their shell , " said @entity60 , 27 , a dedicated @entity6 fan who works for the state of @entity62			1
" it did make it more acceptable to be a female who was into more unconventional sides of society			0
and i think a lot of guys were suddenly like , ' hey , these nerd girls are really cute ! ' instead of just being the best friend , now we 're more accepted as almost sex symbols , thanks to that show			2
" " @entity6 is the sexy , hot chick that 's always slaying everything , but the fact that she has her smart sidekick -- always with the laptop , always researching , i think ( the show ) did a lot to show that there 's more than one type of girl , " said @entity81 , a 32 year old die - hard buffy fan who works at the @entity83 as a development specialist			1
series writer and " @entity6 " comic book contributor @entity96 agreed			1
she said the show 's central characters ( who referred to themselves as the " @entity101 " ) gave overt nerdyness " a lovely coating of coolness and acceptance			2
" fans and critics often wondered how a man like @entity109 could portray the trials and tribulations of being a teenage girl so accurately			0
" we are definitely in tune with our feminine side , " said " @entity6 " comic book artist @entity115 of his collaboration with @entity109			1
" i do n't think it 's so much a respect for women , but it 's just the acceptance of a human being			2
" @entity115 said @entity13 broke the stereotype of helpless , attractive girls in horror movies with " @entity6			1
" " he just thought , what if , once the monster did catch up to the blond girl who was screaming and running away into the alley , what if that girl then turned around and really started kicking some ass ? " @entity96 sees characters like " @entity133 's " ( a sci - fi television show for which she also wrote ) @entity136 and @entity137 as homages to " @entity6 , " as well as " @entity140 's " @entity139			1
but attractive actors and strong female characters are n't the only reasons fans continue to follow the franchise			2
" you can find certain things in the characters that you , personally , can identify with , " said @entity146 , a public relations expert for the @entity149 state highway system and another buffy fan			0
" some days i 'm having a " willow " day and other days i 'm having a " @entity157 " day where nothing goes right , i 'm a complete klutz and i 'm getting knocked in the head all the time , " she said			0
" some days i just want to fall out laughing , and i know exactly where to go back to and watch a certain scene			0
it 's still fun to watch even if you know the entire series by heart			2
" other fans are rewatching the series and blogging about every episode			2
another professed fan of " @entity6 " is actress and writer @entity169			1
she 's been handed the reins to a @entity172 " @entity6 " re-boot movie ( @entity172 , like @entity0 , is owned by @entity173 ) , which has fans and @entity13 's cohorts scratching their heads			1
@entity13 is not involved with the upcoming feature film , and addressed the fact in an open letter on @entity180 online in november 2010			1
" @entity6 is very personal for me , " @entity96 said , " but really i 'm just part of a big machine that exists to allow @entity13 to realize his vision			1
if there is work being done that is n't being guided by @entity13 , then i do n't really see that as related to what i do			1
" " i 'm dubious about her , " said @entity81			0
" maybe she 's like the best writer ever , and she ( is writing ) something so amazing and clever that we will all sit in awe and forgive her , but it 's really , really hard to think of ' buffy ' without @entity13			2
" " i do n't know what she 's done before , " @entity199 comics writer and editor @entity198 said			2
" i think it 's kind of lame			0
people are restarting franchises every five minutes			0
restarts are overlapping at this point			0
" " it 's weird when the guy that made ( @entity6 ) up and is still really personally involved in the character , for somebody else to say , ' well , we have this technicality that allows us to do this , so we 're gon na go re-boot , ' " he said			2
perhaps one reason why a re-boot seems strange to fans and franchise creators alike is that @entity109 is still actively telling the " @entity6 " story			1
in march 2007 , @entity13 started the eighth season of " @entity6 " with @entity199			1
to commemorate her fictional 30th birthday , the last issue of " @entity225 " is in stores january 19			0
buffy is n't necessarily 30 in the comics , @entity115 said , adding that the comic book medium allows time to move a little differently than in a television show			1
@entity115 speculated that as of today 's issue , @entity6 is still around 26 years old			2
" we can have armies fighting , which would have been really hard to pull off in the show , " @entity233 said			0
" our ability to do monsters that are n't just , like , a tall guy in a rubber suit , we embrace			0
" @entity233 said a special effects budget with the @entity199 version of " @entity6 " is never an issue ; they 're only limited by what they can draw			1
plenty of action has happened in " season 8			0
" @entity252 returned from her self - imposed exile , @entity251 showed up on a mountaintop in @entity255 , @entity8 had a sexy tryst with one of the girls she trains to slay vampires , @entity250 proved to be a diabolical villain and -- oh yeah -- @entity260 dies			0
@entity233 assures @entity0 that @entity6 has plenty more adventures left			2
" season 9 " is already in the works			1
" i was down in @entity265 this weekend			0
we had a writer 's summit to talk about season 9 , and ( @entity109 ) is so personally invested in this character , " @entity233 said			1
" because he 's busy with ' @entity272 , ' we had laid out this proposal for how we would do season 9 where he had to do relatively little work			1
because we were trying to be pragmatic , we want to do the book , we want to keep it going , we want to follow his vision , but we want to give him room to go do this other thing and come back			0
" but we 're not going to do that , because he was like , ' well what if we do this other thing ? ' and the ideas are pouring out ( of @entity13 ) about where to take her next , " @entity233 said			2
" he loves this girl , he loves her			0
he created her because he wants her to exist			0
