the first of 1,027 @entity2 have returned home , and in @entity5 observers are cautiously applauding the oft - criticized leadership that secured the deal ; it 's a more hopeful note in a democratic transition that has otherwise been checkered			1
for @entity9 and @entity10 , the culmination of drawn - out and somewhat oblique negotiations possibly signifies a more positive future in relations with a new leadership that had until now been viewed as a potentially destabilizing force for peace in the @entity18			1
in the days since murmurs of a fruitful end to the negotiations began to circulate , @entity5 has reiterated its commitment to honoring its accords with @entity9			1
in reflecting on the months since @entity24 stepped down on february 11 , it is clear that the interim government and de facto president , field marshal @entity26 , have in effect done their utmost to maintain a @entity24 - era status quo			0
the question , is how long will this last ? and will @entity5 continue to be the ally of @entity10 in a region caught in a dependency that often undermines its longer - term interests and the will of its people ? under the @entity24 regime , relations with @entity9 were strong , albeit concealed			1
the 1978 @entity40 treaty was a deal between leaders ( former president @entity43 and @entity9 prime minister @entity44 ) that many @entity5 opposed			1
economic ties between the two states steadily increased under the tutelage of @entity24 's business associates , who stood to profit from them ; and military cooperation , for example on @entity51 , was deep			0
yet many @entity5 continued to harbor deep - rooted animosity towards the neighboring state			1
the former regime , well aware of this , gave people enough space to air their grievances â€” @entity5 's protest movement emerged in part from the tradition of demonstrations in solidarity with the @entity2 , which the government allowed			1
at the same time , the @entity24 regime worked to keep its relations with @entity9 as low profile as possible			1
@entity24 is now gone , most of his business associates have been put behind bars , and the defacto rulers of the liberated @entity5 are left to grapple with the question of @entity9			1
for the ruling military council , adhering to the @entity74 comes at a cost , but until it finds a better alternative to the aid it receives from the @entity10 for sticking to its end of the deal -- a package that includes military training , resources , financial aid , intelligence support , as well as regional security guarantees -- it is worth the price			2
with no viable alternative , the problem , or question perhaps , arises in what pressure a new parliament , and the new - found public voice , might assert to change that status quo			0
outside the @entity9 embassy in @entity100 last month , protesters , many of them young activists , set the @entity9 flag on fire , scaled the embassy walls , and demanded an end to relations with " the @entity107 state			2
" but unlike the people of @entity51 , few @entity5 appear to be celebrating the release of hundreds of prisoners held in @entity9			1
rather , on @entity111 and on the ground , they are describing it as yet another ploy by the ruling military council to consolidate its power			0
" they just want to show that they can negotiate and oversee foreign policy , " someone tweeted			0
" this is a dirty game to secure power , " another said			0
although it is indisputable that the majority of @entity5 -- even the @entity125 -- do not want to go to war , their grievances towards @entity9 , and then @entity10 , run deep ; as deep , perhaps , as their grievances towards the former regime			1
the likelihood of the military council -- or a future cabinet of ministers and its president -- being able to maintain the status quo that long reassured @entity10 and its friends , is highly unlikely			2
rather , in the new @entity5 , which is struggling to get on solid footing , there will be fleeting moments of hope , but also , many more moments of protest when the people stand up and use the leverage they have uncovered in organized street movements to challenge the regime			2
many of the gripes will be internal -- including minimum wage , inflation , and economic opportunities -- but enough will involve @entity5 's relations with the world			2
in @entity5 today , we are witnessing a population that has found its voice , and the confidence and right to assert it			0
we are also witnessing a public that understands what organized protest can achieve			0
there is no taking or turning that back			0
for global powers and neighbors that have long relied on @entity5 as a constant and stable partner and force , that era is gone			0
in the new @entity5 , and the new @entity18 , the will of the people is the force to reckon with , and just as they fought for the ousting of @entity24 , they will also fight for a government of their own choosing			0
in that government , there will be at least as many adversaries to the regional status quo as there are supporters -- and in that too , there will be no turning back .			0
