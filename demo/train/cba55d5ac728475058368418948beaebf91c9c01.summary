@entity2 a generation of troops have served grueling tours of duty in @entity6 and @entity7 since the 9/11 attacks , but few have gripped the country 's conscience in the way @entity13 has			1
in the autobiography that inspired the blockbuster film " @entity13 , " @entity13 wrote that his work on @entity7 battlefields earned him the nickname " legend			1
" that 's what those fighting with @entity13 called him			1
his enemies used another nickname			0
they dubbed him " @entity30 , " or the @entity31 , indicating the fear a man can instill in his foes when he 's capable of taking out a target from a distance of almost 1.2 miles			2
of course , he was n't the only sniper engaged in those epic battles of the @entity34 , but the legend of @entity13 resonates with a wide @entity37 audience			1
not only did his autobiography spend weeks on best - seller lists , but the @entity41 - directed film , which has earned six @entity43 nominations , including best picture , has shattered the box - office record for a war movie , previously held by " @entity47			0
" despite all the talk of war 's complications , @entity13 's view of the @entity34 was unapologetically simplistic			1
" i wanted to go to war			0
i signed up to protect this country			0
i do not choose the wars			0
it happens that i love to fight , " he wrote in his autobiography			0
after completing four tours of duty in @entity7 with at least 160 confirmed sniper kills , @entity13 said he never had regrets about plying his deadly trade			1
even if he had to take out a woman cradling a toddler -- as he reportedly did on his first sniper assignment -- he had no qualms pulling the trigger if it saved the lives of the @entity67 whom he was charged with protecting			2
" it was my duty to shoot and i do n't regret it , " @entity13 wrote in his book			1
" after the first kill , the others come easy			0
i do n't have to psych myself up , or do anything special mentally			0
" fame weighs on trial of accused killer as a @entity77 , @entity13 fought in some of the @entity34 's most vicious battles , including @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , and while 160 was his tally of confirmed kills , he had 95 probable kills that could n't be verified			1
his reputation for taking out insurgents resulted in an $ 80,000 bounty being placed on his head during the war			2
@entity13 's autobiography , which he wrote with the help of authors @entity93 and @entity94 , was published eight months after @entity95 executed the operation that killed @entity97			1
that historic operation spurred fascination with the inner workings and personalities that make up one of the @entity37 military 's most secret and elite forces , yet many military veterans are leery of all the attention @entity13 has received			1
@entity13 , they say , was one of tens of thousands of troops who served heroically in the wars in @entity7 and @entity6			1
" you remove @entity13 from the story , there 's 20,000 other heroes that you can put in there , " said @entity3 global affairs analyst @entity111 , who runs @entity112 , a security consulting firm founded by ex-members of the @entity116 's elite @entity115			1
@entity111 , who himself was a sniper , and served separately as a @entity115 commander during battles in @entity79 , said special forces operators carry a mystique that appeals to @entity37 who 've never served in the military			0
" they are very dynamic , " @entity111 said			0
" people are drawn to them			0
but they 're all @entity37 heroes			0
" but there is a side to @entity13 that 's overlooked			1
it 's left out of the book and movie , but a series of now - debunked stories have served only to make @entity13 's legend larger			1
in his autobiography , @entity13 wrote about a confrontation with a celebrity whom he called " @entity142 , " later identified as former @entity144 gov. @entity143			1
@entity13 claimed in his book that @entity143 told him that the @entity77 " deserve to lose a few " in the wars and then , " i laid him out			1
" @entity143 said the incident never happened and sued @entity13 for defamation			1
last year , a jury ordered @entity13 's estate to pay @entity143 nearly $ 2 million			1
the verdict is being appealed			0
it is just one story in a collection of outlandish tales that @entity13 reportedly repeated often			1
@entity13 bragged about traveling into @entity157 in the days after @entity158 with a fellow sniper and shooting at least 30 looters from the roof of the @entity162			1
there 's no evidence anything of the sort ever occurred			2
and then there 's the story @entity13 told of how he killed two men who tried to carjack him while he was stopped at a gas station along a rural highway southwest of @entity2			1
when police arrived to investigate and ran his driver 's license , @entity13 said , they received a phone number for someone at the @entity174			1
the story ends with the police officers letting @entity13 drive away			1
@entity13 told the gas station story to @entity177 , a writer for @entity178 who was working on a profile			1
@entity180 spent months trying to verify the story , he said			0
he interviewed people at every gas station along the stretch of highway where the shooting allegedly happened			0
he spoke with state and local law enforcement officials in three counties			0
nobody had ever heard of the incident			0
" he was a hero			0
he was the most celebrated war hero of our time , " @entity180 said			0
" it 's really hard to know what to think			2
the fact is he was killed , and there 's no way to get an answer from him now			2
" @entity3 asked @entity13 's widow , @entity201 , to shed light on why her husband told these stories , but she declined the interview request			1
a representative said she was not available to speak about the incidents			0
at @entity13 's funeral , which , befitting the grandeur of his legend , was held in the @entity213 ' massive football stadium , @entity208 did not shy away from her husband 's darker side			1
" i do n't need to romanticize @entity13 because our reality is messy , passionate , full of every extreme emotion known to man , including fear , compassion , anger and pain , " she said			2
despite his well - reported shortcomings , it 's difficult to overlook his life after the @entity77 and how he touched and inspired so many people			0
while he was working to launch a security company -- @entity229 , whose motto is , " despite what your momma told you , violence does solve problems " -- @entity13 dedicated much time to helping fellow veterans with mental health issues transition back to normal life after the battlefield			2
the struggle consumed him in many ways			0
" war one day ; peace the next , " @entity13 wrote in his book			2
it 's also the work that led to his february 2 , 2013 , death			1
@entity13 had taken his friend , @entity250 , and fellow veteran @entity251 to the firing range that day			2
a hunting guide would later find @entity13 and @entity250 dead			2
@entity251 was charged in their deaths			0
a jury was seated monday and opening statements in the capital murder trial are slated to begin wednesday			1
for many of the military 's elite , the decision to leave the battlefield is an excruciating one			0
the sense of duty to protect fellow troops is a feeling that @entity13 struggled to let go			2
there 's also a sense of glory and power that snipers find hard to walk away from			0
" we 're trained to go out and kill people , " @entity13 wrote in his autobiography			2
" and then at the same time , we 're also being taught to think of ourselves as invincible bad asses			0
that 's a pretty potent combination			0
" correction : earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of @entity250 , who was killed with @entity13			2
@entity250 was not a veteran			0
@entity3 's @entity283 contributed to this report .			0

jury seated in capital murder trial of @entity288 , charged in @entity13 's killing
@entity13 was called " legend , " but insurgents called him the @entity292 of @entity80
stories since his 2013 death reveal @entity13 had both a soft and a dark side
