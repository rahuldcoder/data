@entity0 -- just call it the anti-protest protest			1
tens of thousands of people marched through @entity0 yesterday in support of @entity7 and to protest @entity8 , a pro-democracy movement that says it will plan to stage a civil disobedience sit - in unless the @entity7 government allows the @entity0 public to nominate and vote for its next leader			1
@entity14 , the organizer of sunday 's march , said it represented @entity0 's desire to work " peacefully " with the @entity7 government in @entity18 on political reform			1
" we want universal suffrage , but not at any cost , " he told @entity1 monday			0
the pro-government march followed the same route as @entity0 's massive annual anti-government , pro-democracy rally on july 1 , but the tenor was markedly different : sunday 's marchers were arranged into organized groups wearing matching t - shirts , some emblazoned with names of mainland @entity7 organizations			1
paid protester claim local media swirled with reports of marchers getting paid or bused in to attend the pro-government march			0
one video ( @entity41 ) purportedly showed cash being handed out to marchers			0
other images appeared to show marchers getting paid and enjoying free food in a dim - sum restaurant			0
@entity14 said he took the bribery accusations " seriously " and would " investigate " but maintained that no laws were broken			0
there were also conflicting reports on the size of the march			0
@entity14 said his group counted a " quarter million " marchers , but an estimate by @entity56 statisticians put the number much lower , between 79,000 and 88,000			2
by contrast , july 's pro-democracy rally drew between 154,000 and 172,000 , according to the university			0
pictures taken by reporters appeared to show a noticeably thinner crowd on sunday than the crowd in july , but @entity14 said the difference was because " we were marching very , very fast			0
" historic @entity0 neighborhood fights to preserve its past different visions of democracy @entity70 , the organizer of @entity8 , said @entity14 's rally offered " nothing substantial " in terms of new ideas			1
" [ @entity14 's supporters ] talk about universal suffrage , but they never explain what they mean by universal suffrage			0
" @entity70 's group has proposed an electoral reform package in which every citizen would be allowed to vote for the city 's next leader , with candidates freely nominated by the general public			1
but @entity18 says it will only allow citizens to vote on candidates that are approved by a small , @entity7 - friendly committee			2
@entity14 , who supports the government 's plan , said @entity91 should take the deal rather than risk a volatile showdown with @entity7			1
" we want universal suffrage , with peace			0
@entity97 has universal suffrage -- has it got peace ? no , we do n't want that , " he said			0
" @entity70 wants a specific way of election , or else			2
if we do n't get it , then all hell breaks loose			0
" the current chief executive of @entity0 , @entity105 , is favored by @entity18 and has signed a petition in support of @entity14 's movement			1
under the " one country , two systems " policy , the seven million residents of @entity0 -- defined as a " @entity110 " of @entity7 -- are afforded greater civil liberties than those in the mainland , under a leadership approved by @entity18			1
this reflects an agreement reached between @entity7 and the @entity120 prior to the handover of the city in 1997 , which promised @entity0 a " high degree of autonomy " for 50 years after its return			1
but there are increasing fears that those freedoms are being eroded			0
opinion : @entity0 's struggle for democracy matters what is @entity18 thinking ? the future of @entity0 could become clear soon			1
on august 31 , @entity7 's powerful @entity135 is expected to announce a decision on @entity0 's electoral reform			1
if the decision seems to leave open the possibility for @entity91 to nominate their own leaders , then @entity70 has said he 'll work with the government to produce an election reform plan that " satisfies international standards			1
" but if not , " there will be no more negotiation and we will have to plan for @entity8			2
" the threat of civil disobedience " is our bargaining power , " he explained			0
" they take us seriously , though they will never admit that			0
" democracy in @entity7 ? although at odds with one another , both @entity14 and @entity70 believe democracy in @entity0 might one day lead to democracy in @entity7			1
@entity70 said @entity0 is a test case for the mainland 's political future			1
" for political reform , that is , introducing true elections , @entity0 could be the experimental ground for the @entity166			2
the @entity7 government will closely observe how elections will be conducted			2
" if @entity0 gets the chance to have true universal suffrage , that may reflect that @entity7 has the intention to introduce political reform or some kind of election in the future -- maybe in five or ten years			1
" @entity14 said @entity7 democracy might look " very different from the western style of democracy			2
" maybe it 'll turn out to be a better system			0
" read more : will protest or persuasion shape @entity0 's future ?			2
