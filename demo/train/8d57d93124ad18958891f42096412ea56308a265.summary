-- a high school senior 's lawsuit against her mother and father for financial support and college tuition hit a hurdle tuesday when a @entity9 judge denied the teenager 's request for immediate financial assistance from the parents			1
@entity14 , 18 , alleges in her lawsuit that her parents forced her out of their @entity18 , @entity9 home , and that she is unable to support herself financially			1
the lawsuit asks that her parents pay the remaining tuition for her last semester at her private high school , pay her current living and transportation expenses , commit to paying her college tuition and pay her legal fees for the suit she filed against her parents			1
her parents say she left home because she did n't want to obey their rules			1
judge @entity29 denied the request for high school tuition and current living expenses at a hearing tuesday in @entity34			1
another hearing will be held in april on other issues in the suit , including whether @entity39 left home of her own accord , the judge said			1
@entity39 , an honor student and cheerleader at @entity43 in @entity44 , says in court documents she had to leave her parents ' home because of emotional and psychological mistreatment , alleging , among other things , that her mother called her " fat " and " porky " and that her father threatened to beat her			1
" i have been subjected to severe verbal and physical abuse by my mother and father , " @entity39 wrote in a court certification			1
" i am not willingly and voluntarily leaving a reasonable situation at home to make my own decisions			0
i had to leave to end the abuse			2
" @entity39 left her parents ' home at the end of last october			1
after spending two nights at her boyfriend 's home , she moved into the home of her friend in a nearby town , where she has been staying ever since , according to court documents written by the parents ' attorney			1
fair or outrageous ? @entity9 teen sues her parents to pay up for college @entity39 seeks a court 's official declaration that she is unemancipated , meaning her parents would still be required to support her financially			1
she also is suing to reimburse her friend 's parents , @entity82 and @entity83 , for legal fees that they have been paying since the lawsuit was initiated , according to the suit			1
@entity39 's parents , @entity88 and @entity89 , claim that allegations of abuse are completely unfounded			1
" we were always her support team , cheering her on or defending her whenever she had a problem , " wrote @entity89 in a court certification			2
she claims that her daughter was never forced out of the family 's home , but rather " took it upon herself to run away so that she could live her life without any parental supervision and without any rules			1
" @entity39 was suspended from school for truancy last october , according to court documents filed by her parents ' attorney , @entity107			1
her parents told the teen that she could no longer see her boyfriend , who was also suspended from school			2
car and phone privileges were also taken away			0
once she learned of the punishment , @entity39 cut school again and then decided to run away , her father said in court documents			1
once she left home , her parents notified @entity43 that they would no longer pay for their daughter 's tuition , the documents state			1
" they stopped paying my high school tuition to punish the school and me , and have redirected my college fund indicating their refusal to afford me an education , " @entity14 stated in court documents			1
the situation around the teen and her family initiated an investigation by @entity9 's @entity131 ( @entity132 ) , which received allegations that @entity14 was being abused			1
the teen wrote in court documents that her school contacted the state agency			0
when @entity132 staffers interviewed the teen , her parents , and her two younger sisters , they ultimately " determined that allegation of emotional abuse was unfounded , " a letter from @entity132 states			2
@entity39 , a retired @entity18 police chief and current business administrator for the town of @entity146 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity147 that he and his wife are " distraught			2
" " we 're being sued by our child			0
so are my other daughters , " he said			0
" living in our house , there 's very few things			2
there 's minor chores , there 's curfews			2
when i say curfew , it 's usually after 11 o'clock at night			2
" @entity39 wrote in court documents that the @entity163 , for taking in his daughter , had " enabled the situation to an absurd level			2
under the guise of good intentions , they have arrogantly placed themselves in our stead and operated under the belief that their parenting style is superior to our own			0
" @entity0 's attempts to reach @entity82 or @entity83 were unsuccessful			2
@entity174 , a family law attorney and @entity176 family law officer , said to her knowledge , a case like this is unprecedented			0
though @entity39 is 18 years old , @entity9 law does not consider a person to be emancipated unless that person has left " the scope of his or her parents ' authority , " according to @entity174			1
" a parent is not obligated to contribute to the support of an emancipated child , " said @entity174			2
" a child is emancipated when he or she is beyond the control of the parents			2
is she truly beyond the scope of her parents ' authority , as a result of her own voluntary acts ? that 's for the judge to decide			1
" " the argument ( she ) is making is that she did n't leave home voluntary			0
she 's saying ' i was thrown out , ' " @entity174 said			0
neither @entity14 nor her parents testified at tuesday 's hearing , but it saw a reunion between the daughter and her estranged parents , the first one in over four months			1
while @entity39 was seen speaking to @entity14 , @entity89 was seen briefly weeping after being seated			1
the parents ' attorney , @entity211 - @entity107 , told @entity0 that @entity89 is too upset about the situation to even talk about it			0
she said the @entity213 have told their daughter to come home , and she has refused			0
" to be clear , my clients never abandoned nor abused their child and they have asked her to come home			0
they simply sought to exert their own parental judgment and reasonable household rules which she is not willing to accept , " @entity211 - @entity107 said in court tuesday			0
@entity14 's attorney , @entity223 , said @entity88 and @entity89 are being " negligent and irresponsible			1
" " normal healthy parents want to help their children			0
they want their children to go to college			0
they want to help them with their difficulties , " @entity223 said in court			0
" you may not get along wonderfully every single day with your teenager			0
that does n't mean that you abandon them and you say , ' guess what , you 're on your own			0
' " judge @entity29 denied the request for the last semester of high school tuition because the school said she could continue anyway , since she is an honor student			2
and @entity14 wrote in her court certification that " the peer ministers at @entity43 have decided to raise funds to pay ... tuition so i do n't have to leave early			1
" as for why he denied the request for immediate financial assistance , the judge indicated he did n't see an emergency situation , and would make further decisions at the next hearing			1
the teen wrote in her court certification that she aspires to be a biomedical engineer			0
her first choice for college is the @entity256 , from which she has yet to hear back from regarding her admission decision			0
she said taking legal action was necessary to ensure that she is able to accomplish her future goals			0
" i am a very good student			0
i have no drug problems			0
i am a good athlete			0
i work at a job outside of school , " she wrote			0
" my parents simply will not help me any longer ... ( they ) should be required to provide for my support and education until i can stand on my own two feet			2
in order to do this , i had to take legal action			0
