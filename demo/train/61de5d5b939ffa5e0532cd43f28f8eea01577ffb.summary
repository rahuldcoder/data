-- @entity1 is having a moment			0
not only did the red - headed @entity4 nominee win a @entity5 last weekend for her work in " @entity7 , " which forced her to take a night off from her @entity9 run â € ” yes she 's starring in @entity9 's " @entity10 " during the thick of awards season â € ” but she 's now achieved something few actors have ever managed : she currently holds the number one and number two movies at the box office			1
@entity18 's latest vehicle , " mama , " crushed the competition over the three - day weekend with a whopping $ 28.1 million			1
@entity20 , who produced the @entity23 film for only $ 15 million , opened " @entity26 " in 2,647 theaters , where it earned a terrific $ 10,624 average			1
the horror title played very well with young women â € ” 61 percent of viewers were female , and 63 percent were below the age of 25			0
unfortunately , most of those audiences were n't overly enthusiastic about what they saw , issuing " @entity26 " a lackluster " b - " cinemascore grade			2
@entity18 's other entry , " @entity7 , " fell only 28 percent in its sophomore weekend of wide release to $ 17.6 million , which brought the @entity42 huntdown 's total to $ 55.9 million			1
controversy continues to boost the @entity46 - directed drama 's profile , but great word - of - mouth seems to be playing just as big of a role in " @entity7 's " success			2
' @entity50 ' effect : 9 @entity4 killers ? it 's fair to say that @entity18 's presence in both " @entity26 " and " @entity7 " had little to do with each film 's successful box office performance			1
neither was marketed on her appeal , and yet , that does n't take away from her achievement			0
" @entity62 " performed very nicely in its nationwide expansion			1
upon jumping from 810 to 2,523 theaters , " playbook " increased 126 percent to $ 11.4 million , which brings its total to $ 55.3 million so far			2
( kudos to the @entity71 for its deftly executed platform strategy			0
if they had opened " @entity62 " in wide release , as planned , we almost certainly would n't be talking about it 10 weeks later			1
) in the month leading up to @entity4 season , good word - of - mouth may continue to carry " @entity62 " to a total as high as $ 100 million			1
' @entity77 ' vs. zombies : can you help ? in fourth place , @entity80 ' crime drama " @entity81 " fell 47 percent to $ 9.1 million , giving the $ 60 million @entity85 / @entity84 action flick an unremarkable $ 32.2 million total after ten days			1
still , " @entity81 's " second weekend was better than the debuts of new releases " @entity89 " and " @entity90 , " which both flopped out of the gate			0
@entity98 's $ 35 million " @entity89 , " which stars the usually reliable @entity99 alongside @entity100 , drew only $ 9.0 million worth of tickets from 2,620 theaters , while @entity97 's $ 45 million " @entity90 , " an @entity96 film , fared even worse with a puny $ 6.3 million			0
both films played primarily to older male audiences ( who are also seeing " @entity7 " and " @entity81 " ) , and they may have cannibalized each other over their first three days			0
" mama " -- $ 28.1 million 2			1
" @entity7 " -- $ 17.6 million 3			2
" @entity62 " -- $ 11.4 million 4			2
" @entity81 " -- $ 9.1 million 5			0
