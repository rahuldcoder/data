the @entity1 ' first ever clinic for assisted suicide and euthanasia has opened and includes a mobile service for those who wish to die at home			1
its launch made headlines , and the clinic received 60 applications in the first two days of operation -- mostly from terminally ill patients -- but the @entity13 ( end of @entity14 ) in @entity15 has yet to euthanize a single patient			1
" no , of course not ! " exclaimed spokeswoman @entity18 , laughing in shock at the notion			0
" it 's not that you can go to the clinic and say , ' well , i want to die , ' and then tomorrow someone is coming			2
" the @entity27 presidential campaign oddly put euthanasia in the @entity1 into the news limelight in february , after @entity31 candidate @entity30 criticized it to make an argument against socialized medicine			1
@entity30 has made death at the hands of a @entity1 family doctor sound much easier to come by than the clinic 's spokeswoman or the @entity1 ' health ministry			1
the candidate claimed that in the @entity1 physicians euthanize elderly @entity1 patients against their will to hold down medical costs			1
" half the people who are euthanized in the @entity1 -- and it 's ten percent of all deaths for the @entity1 -- half of those people are euthanized involuntarily at hospitals , because they are older and sick , " @entity30 said at an appearance at a conservative rally in @entity47 , @entity48 on february 3 , 2012			1
@entity30 's rant set off indignant reactions in the media in the @entity1 , including headlines of a @entity61 politician demanding the @entity1 ambassador or the country 's foreign minister rebut the @entity27 candidate			1
" @entity30 thinks he knows the @entity1 : massive murder of the elderly , " read a headline in the february 18 edition of the @entity1 daily newspaper @entity68			1
almost 140,000 people die in the @entity1 per year , according to the @entity72			1
the intentional ending of life with a doctor 's help accounts for about 3,000 of those deaths , according to the @entity1 @entity78 -- percentage mathematics would land at a figure of under 2.5 % , far lower than @entity30 's numbers			1
@entity30 has also claimed that elderly people wear bracelets in the @entity1 reading " do not euthanize me , " a claim de @entity85 has refuted			1
@entity86 reached out to @entity30 , whose campaign is in high gear , via his press representatives to inquire into the source of the @entity31 candidate 's statistics			1
as of press time , there has been no on - the - record response			0
the @entity96 has published percentages of doctor - assisted death at a patient 's request in the @entity1 , and they range from 1.7 % and 2.6 % of all deaths in the country			1
it also placed the percentage of patients dying in palliative care at 7 %			2
palliative and hospice care are common end - of - life treatment alternatives in many countries , including the @entity27 its not clear if @entity30 was including palliative and hospice care when he said 10 % of all deaths in the @entity1 are the result of euthanasia			1
those seeking medical help to quell their suffering by ending their lives have to take a long road to get it , according to the @entity1 health ministry , and the majority of patient requests -- a full two - thirds -- are denied			1
the patient must first convince his doctor that his suffering is unbearable			0
his ailment must be incurable			0
" the criteria are that there must be a reoccurring voluntary request , " clinic spokeswoman @entity85 said			2
" there must be an unbearable and hopeless suffering , no alternatives anymore , and there must also be a second opinion doctor , who says ' yes , this doctor is fulfilling the criteria			0
' and then the euthanasia or assisted suicide can be done			2
" sometimes the patient dies while waiting for the euthanasia to pass approval			2
under the @entity1 definition , euthanasia is when a doctor administers a lethal dose of a medication to end a patient 's life at the patient 's request			1
assisted suicide is when the doctor acquires the deadly dose for the patient , who then administers it on him - or herself			0
commonly used medications to hasten life 's end are muscle relaxers and barbiturates			0
then there are the legal hurdles			0
" euthanasia is still a criminal offence , " a statement on the foreign ministry website explains the @entity1 stance on the topic to the world			1
but doctors are exempt from prosecution , if they follow a strict set of criteria laid down by a 2002 law , the @entity1 termination of @entity182			1
" patients have no absolute right to euthanasia and doctors no absolute duty to perform it , " the ministry says			1
" a doctor 's main duty is indeed to preserve life			0
" " on the other hand , " it adds , " they have a duty to relieve the patient 's suffering			0
" the doctor , it seems , would be between a rock and a hard place			0
after helping terminate the life , a doctor must report it as a death by unnatural causes to the coroner 's office , where it faces review by a legal expert , a doctor and an ethics expert			0
if they do n't like what they see , the case is forwarded to the @entity216			0
add this tension to other more personal qualms , and many doctors just wo n't give that lethal dose			0
enter the brand new end of @entity14 -- founded by the advocacy group " right to die @entity223 , " for which @entity85 is also the spokeswoman			0
" people are dependent on their doctors , and when you have a doctor who does n't want to do it , sometimes you have no one to turn to , " @entity85 said			2
" the biggest doctors ' organization in the @entity1 says that every doctor has the moral obligation to refer to another doctor , when he does n't want to do it , " she continued			1
" but there are also doctors who do n't want to refer to another doctor			0
therefore this clinic can be a possibility for those people			1
" once the patient opts for the help of one of the @entity250 's doctors , it can still take a long time for the end to come			0
by law , the doctor who carries out the euthanasia or assisted suicide must be considered the patient 's attending physician			2
the clinic declined to let @entity86 interview one of its participating doctors or nurses , who are everyday medical professionals and work for the clinic part - time			2
@entity265 said she was afraid patients would snow the clinicians at their private practices with euthanasia requests due to the publicity			1
after the patient has filed a request , " a doctor and a nurse will look whether they can fulfill the criteria , " de @entity85 said			0
then they contact the patient , his relatives and the attending physician for a series of conversations			0
these can last as short as two weeks , if a patient 's prognosis and suffering are obvious -- or as long as a year , @entity85 said			0
" people talk about it too late and then discover that their doctor wo n't do it , " de @entity85 warned			2
right to die @entity223 encourages its 130,000 members to make a living will , which includes end of life plans , ahead of time			2
the vast majority of patients -- about ten times as many as receive euthanasia or assisted suicide -- end up with the palliative alternative of heavy sedation , while waiting for the end to come naturally , according to a 2005 academic review of the euthanasia law and its consequences			1
a possible side effect of that sedation is the hastening of death			0
but with all the considerations , in 2005 doctors in the @entity1 reported helping 2,425 patients who voluntarily decided they wanted to end their lives and 3,136 in 2010			1
there is some truth to @entity30 's claim that some patients ' lives are taken without consent , but at a lower rate than five percent of all deaths in the @entity1 , as the presidential candidate had said			1
the 2005 report placed the number at 550 deaths			0
it tends to be patients in palliative care , who are unconscious , which means the doctor ca n't ask what the patient wants , @entity85 said			2
" and maybe the doctor did something he should n't do			0
" " but i think this is a problem everywhere in the world			0
" there are also newborns , children and teenagers who are euthanized in accordance with strict legal protocol and parental involvement , which include that " suffering must be unbearable and with no prospect of improvement			0
" teenagers over 16 years of age are allowed to make the request without parental approval but require their consultation			0
people plagued with psychiatric illness also request and receive help ending their lives , although it is discouraged			2
" the first priority in responding to such requests is to explore the prospects of an improvement in the patient 's quality of life , " according the foreign ministry			0
the overwhelming majority of cases of doctor assisted end - of - life care are easier to understand than those involving children or psychiatric patients			2
" experience shows that in practice the vast majority of cases of euthanasia ( almost 90 % ) relate to patients with terminal cancer , " according to the foreign ministry			1
a 2010 review commission report revealed terminal cancer at the root of the overwhelming majority of cases			0
even with its humane intentions , such open dealings with euthanasia and assisted suicide as it is practiced in the @entity1 may rub many cultures the wrong way			1
@entity1 authorities are aware of this			1
" @entity1 law on euthanasia is not incompatible with international conventions and the fundamental human rights they enshrine , such as the right to life laid down in article 6 of the @entity403 's @entity402 , " a statement reads on the foreign ministry 's website			1
" the @entity1 government vigorously endorses these rights , but does not believe that a request to end life made by someone experiencing unbearable suffering without the prospect of improvement should be refused solely on those grounds			1
" @entity265 anticipates that the end of @entity14 's mobile team may become active as soon as this week " to visit a patient , and of course they are also to consult the doctor of the patient			2
" the clinic 's mobile team does not have any kind of special vehicle like an ambulance , @entity85 said			2
the doctors and nurses simply drive their own cars			0
in some scenarios , @entity85 says , the clinic 's focus is not on euthanizing the patient as much as it is on ensuring the doctor feels comfortable committing to the process			0
" they want to take him by the hand in the process and maybe afterwards or in the process he can say , ' well , i can do it myself , ' or afterwards he can say , ' the second time i can do it myself			0

the @entity1 ' first ever euthanasia clinic opens and includes mobile service
@entity30 claimed @entity1 physicians euthanize elderly patients against their will
@entity30 also said elderly @entity1 people wear bracelets reading " do not euthanize me "
