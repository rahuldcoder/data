@entity0 , @entity1 -- in one chair sits a rural retiree , his financial security shot in the slump , a humble southerner who 's never thought much about politics			1
in another seat is a born @entity10 , an inner - city native , a relative of a civil rights giant			1
and nearby , circling a table , are an economist , an artist , a onetime @entity17 supporter and a long - haired guy who 's rich in @entity20 memories			1
meet these members of the @entity22 , an organically grown , freshly brewed push that 's marking its official kickoff saturday			1
across the country , even around the globe , they and other @entity25 in at least several hundred communities are expected to gather in coffeehouses to raise their mugs of java to something new			1
they 're professionals , musicians and housewives			1
they 're frustrated liberal activists , disheartened conservatives and political newborns			1
they 're young and old , rich and poor , black , white and all shades of other			1
born on @entity42 just six weeks ago , the group boasts more than 110,000 fans , as of friday morning			1
the @entity22 is billed by many as an answer to the @entity46 ( more than 1,000 fewer fans ) , a year - old protest movement that 's steeped in fiscal conservatism and boiling - hot , anti-tax rhetoric			1
this new group calls for civility , objects to obstructionism and demands that politicians be held accountable to the people who put them in office			1
are you at a @entity22 gathering ? share your images , story " the government has become so broken that the will of the people has been lost in the political game , " said @entity61 , 46 , coordinator of the @entity0 , @entity1 , chapter			1
" and the only voices you 're hearing are the ones of those who are screaming the loudest			1
they have a right to their views , but they do n't have the right to speak for all @entity25			1
" at a recent @entity22 planning meeting at @entity78 , an @entity0 political institution , about 40 people gathered to speak for themselves			1
they brought their own stories of why they were there			1
the one who was " never active in this stuff " politics ? it never spoke to @entity87 , who 's preferred the simple life			1
at 69 , he lives in a two - room house on a rural dirt road in @entity91 , drives a 26 - year - old @entity93 pickup and takes odd jobs to get by			2
he cuts grass , chops wood and does handyman work			2
earlier this week , he freed a bird from someone 's house and " got paid with a bottle of whiskey , " he said with a laugh			2
he does n't need much			2
but @entity87 , who worked in maintenance for @entity105 for 30 years , has seen the little security he might have had -- his retirement money , for example , and his home 's value -- fall apart in recent years			2
and he just does n't understand why some fancy executive should earn millions			2
his own daddy made $ 12 a week building roads for the @entity114 during the @entity115			2
" our country was a hell of a lot worse off then , and we came together , and we did something , " he said			1
" i 'm not that smart			2
i do n't know the dollars and cents			2
but i 'm just looking for something different			2
" the @entity0 coordinator @entity61 was 5 when she stared at the two water fountains : one marked " colored , " the other " white			1
" the @entity125 was somewhere in @entity126 at a train stop with her mother and grandmother , and , well , she 'd never drunk colored water before and figured white was what she wanted			2
but her grandmother yanked her away from that water , muttering something about her getting them all killed			2
that moment , and her childlike understanding of what it meant , stuck with @entity61 and has driven her ever since			2
the stay - at - home mom used to work in the real - estate mortgage field but left when she became disheartened by the industry			2
she feels hopeful about the people who are re-engaging in and taking ownership of the political process			1
" president @entity145 is stifled by a dysfunctional @entity146			2
when he was on the campaign trail , he used the word ' we ' a lot			1
he can not do this alone			0
he needs our help , " she said			0
" @entity25 are waking up across the board			0
... not everyone is cut out to be an activist			0
but everyone can do something			0
" the young fiscal conservative when other kids were watching cartoons , @entity160 tuned in to news programs			0
for as long as the @entity165 , @entity1 , high school senior can remember , he 's been drawn to politics			0
he 's 17 and ca n't vote , but he 's long volunteered for campaigns			0
the self - described libertarian and fiscal conservative was , and in some ways still is , a supporter of the @entity46			0
he initially backed sen. @entity17 for president in 2008 and is n't , himself , comfortable with the idea of a public option in the health - care system			0
but the direction @entity176 has seen the @entity46 take recently has him concerned			0
he ca n't help but think it 's being hijacked by social conservatives and the far right , he said , and as a gay man who 's committed to gay rights , it may not be his cup of political tea			1
so he 's pulled up a chair at the @entity22 to see what it can offer			1
next to him is a college @entity186 leader wearing a t - shirt that reads : " i 'll hug your [ picture of an elephant ] if you kiss my [ picture of a donkey ]			0
" " i never feel uncomfortable stating my opinions , " but it was " sort of ironic			0
they wanted free discussion of the issues but did n't want to talk about the conservative side of things , " @entity160 said after the planning meeting			1
" i think it was great , but i 'd like to see more conservatives and libertarians			0
" the disillusioned @entity145 supporter " as a @entity209 woman , i was taught that discussing politics and religion is ill - mannered , " said @entity206 , 53 , of @entity207 , @entity1			0
but she became an involved and vocal @entity186 when she " realized that @entity25 had been lied to about @entity212 , that our military uses torture , and when i heard @entity17 sing ' bomb , bomb , bomb @entity218			0
' " she said she began registering voters for the @entity221 , canvassed her neighborhood to talk about issues that had become dear to her and endured " icy stares and insults			0
" unable to find @entity145 bumper stickers and other materials where she lives , the @entity228 lecturer and a friend ordered them in bulk and made sure others had access to them			0
" i am looking for a group of informed thinkers who might be able to impact the obstructionism we now have in @entity240 , " she said			1
" i 've gotten really disillusioned with the lack of change that 's happened			0
... there are a lot of people looking for something different			1
we have a lot more in common than we realize			1
" the man @entity250 called " baby " @entity252 likes to say he was born into an organization			0
he has a twin brother and learned early on what it meant to work with others			0
through church involvement and his family , the @entity259 , @entity260 , native gleaned more			0
his great - grandmother 's first cousin was the legendary civil rights activist @entity265 , whom he grew up calling " @entity250			0
" he remembers her telling him , " ' you know , baby , you 're not special			0
you 're unique , ' " and that 's a distinction he appreciates today			0
to be special means you deserve more , your own category ; everyone , on the other hand , is unique and has something to offer			0
the 27 - year - old social entrepreneur and nonprofit consultant works in sustainability			0
while a political philosophy major at @entity280 in @entity0 , he started the @entity281 , which set out to bring low - income black communities into the green movement one compact fluorescent light bulb at a time			1
he calls himself a " political realist " who never expects change to happen in a flash			1
he did n't put that on @entity145 , and he looks at the @entity22 with cautious optimism			1
" i think that space is definitely onto something , " he said			0
it 's " another way to start a conversation			0
that 's what i really like			0
