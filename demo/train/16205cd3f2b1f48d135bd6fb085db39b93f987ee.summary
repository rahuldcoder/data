-- " @entity1 " has me a little confused			1
i 've watched the show since the beginning and think it is one of the best sitcoms , evah			2
it 's laugh - out - loud funny and unpredictable ( who can forget @entity8 or @entity11 's @entity10 pop single , " @entity12 " ? ) , and gets the late 20 - something experience like no other show			2
not to mention that @entity15 as @entity16 is one of the funniest characters of all time			0
the premise of the show has been that @entity21 is narrating to his children how he met their mother			2
only , fours years in , we still have no idea who she is			0
earlier this year , the show 's executive producer promised that in episode 100 , airing this coming monday , we would finally be introduced to this elusive mother			1
at the same time , it was leaked that @entity33 was cast for a recurring role on the show			1
it made so much sense : @entity21 and @entity33 , @entity38 and @entity21			1
they 're both brunette and would look adorable together			0
but now new casting news is messing everything up			0
i just read that two other ladies of note are getting roles on the show			0
first up is former pro-wrestler @entity48 , who will also be in the 100th episode			1
and @entity50 just confirmed that she will be on the show this spring			2
so , uh , who is the mother ? my instinct tells me that @entity33 is too obvious a choice , considering this is a show that 's kept us guessing for four years			1
the @entity0 : 13 super annoying ways people abuse @entity60 and @entity61 remember how , after watching @entity21 and @entity11 's romance begin to blossom , we got to the last second of the season premiere and @entity21 said , " and that 's how i met your @entity11			0
" i just know we 're in for a twist here			0
