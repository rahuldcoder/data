@entity0 -- this weekend we pause to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the preliminary @entity4 that set in motion the freeing of the slaves throughout the @entity8			1
but as we focus on @entity10 's action on september 22 , 1862 , we should also realize that there was another crucial date in the story of freedom			1
perhaps the most significant event in @entity17 history -- other than the creation of the documents that created our nation -- was @entity10 's emancipation of the slaves in the @entity0 on april 16 , eight and a half months before the historic signing of the @entity4			1
it was the most significant because it began the process of stopping the one thing that could have ended this nation : slavery			1
the @entity0 proclamation predated the @entity4 by months , but it received no less attention from the nation			1
it was a highly controversial document , and it was the first and only time that the government tried to compensate owners for freeing the enforced laborers			0
owners loyal to the @entity17 were paid $ 300 per person , and each freed man , woman or child was paid $ 100 -- almost one - third of a working man 's yearly wage in 1862 -- for those people who chose to return home			2
compensating slaveholders was never tried again			0
@entity0 was a hub of the slave trade			1
slaves were sold across from the @entity48 in @entity49			2
slave pens , or jails , holding the slaves for sale were located throughout the @entity0			1
@entity54 , a slave in @entity0 , would take walks to @entity56			1
" i frequently saw large numbers of people of my color chained together in long trains , and driven off towards the @entity8 , " he wrote			0
@entity61 was one of @entity10 's most severe critics			1
for those unfamiliar with him , among man , @entity61 stands beside @entity10 as a towering giant of the @entity66			1
born a slave , @entity61 , in his own words , " stole this body " and escaped to @entity70 , @entity71			0
self - educated , @entity61 became known nationwide			0
@entity10 invited him to the @entity48 four times			1
( twice for meetings , once to his second inauguration and once to the @entity75 , which @entity61 declined because he had a speaking engagement			0
) the first meeting changed @entity61 ' tune			0
after that conversation @entity61 said , " i felt as if i had known him all my life			0
" what was most important , @entity61 had @entity10 's ear ; the president listened			1
ending the sale of slaves in the @entity0 was a thing of wonder			1
the act , said @entity61 , was " a priceless and an unspeakable blessing			0
" a district citizen ( an @entity92 who was a free man all his life ) , wrote a friend in @entity95 , " were i a drinker i would get on a @entity98 spree today , but as a @entity99 i can but kneel in prayer and bless @entity101 for the privilege i 've enjoyed this day			1
" because of the @entity66 , the @entity103 was not formally celebrated until 1866 , when 5,000 marched from the @entity104 up @entity105 to @entity106 , cheered by a crowd of 10,000 lining the way			0
earlier this year , the @entity0 's non-voting member of @entity110 , the @entity112 @entity111 , led @entity0 's celebration of @entity103			1
many years ago , her great - grandfather , @entity114 , lived in the city			0
president @entity10 's signature did n't free him			1
he freed himself when he walked away from a slave plantation in @entity118 in the 1850 's			0
but @entity10 's mighty pen made 3,100 men , women and children equal in the laws of the land			1
the congresswomen did more than simply honor legacy ; she brought the emancipation legacy home to us now			0
she said that the city , unlike the 3,100 who were emancipated , could free itself of congressional rule			2
( @entity0 's citizens do not have senators and have but one non-voting representative in @entity110			2
@entity110 must approve all legislation @entity0 's @entity138 enacts			2
) @entity139 said , " our freedom is locked up in the @entity104			2
we can claim it , or leave it there			0
" we can claim it , or leave it there			0
" this fall , the descendants of slaves , millions of ethnic and religious minorities from other lands , african - americans and immigrants -- latinos , @entity153 , @entity154 -- and women , as well as working - and middle - class @entity17 , will decide whether to claim their future			0
we are all in this together			0
all @entity17 will have a chance to move @entity10 's vision forward to help close the opportunity gap , to end the economic inequality resulting from government policies that favor a handful over the many who work equally hard			2
@entity10 would be proud to see the progress we have made			2
but he also would understand that there is still more work to do			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2
