the @entity1 @entity1 marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the @entity3			1
if the on - site " wall of @entity1 " is any indication , a tour through the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , is guaranteed fun for the whole canned - pork - loving family			1
@entity1 's parent company , @entity12 , opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of @entity1			2
one of the main attractions is a scale model of a @entity1 plant , where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce @entity23 's favorite tinned meat			2
@entity24 it 's pretty hard to argue with the motto " @entity27 is a @entity28			2
" so goes the backhanded optimism of the @entity24 , a @entity31 facility that opened in 1992			2
visitors are treated to exhibits that include a @entity35 embalming display and a replica of a turn - of - the - century casket factory			2
in addition , the museum boasts an exhibit of " fantasy coffins " designed by @entity43 artist @entity42			1
these moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken , a @entity47 , a shallot , and an outboard motor			2
according to @entity42 , his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients , which -- let 's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot			2
the @entity58 if you 're bumming around but looking for a good time , be sure to take a load off in @entity62 , @entity63 , at @entity64 , which details the history and culture of tramps			2
bear in mind , though , that the museum kind of , well , slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual @entity72			1
luckily , tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year			0
of course , if you 're interested in the @entity72 , lodging is available all over the area , but it 's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the " hobo jungle , " located by the railroad tracks			0
both the event and the museum are operated by the @entity84 , which -- incidentally -- also oversees the nearby @entity85 , where those who have " caught the westbound " are laid to rest			1
the @entity89 originally , the @entity90 erected the @entity89 as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena			1
( you know , babies with two heads , that sort of thing			0
) but today , it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque			0
there , you 'll find the world 's largest colon , removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation			0
also on display : an @entity115 instrument collection , thousands of fluid - preserved anatomical and pathological specimens , and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects			0
the @entity117 what better way to honor " @entity119 " founder @entity120 than with a mediocre museum in @entity122 , @entity123 ? some visitors will appreciate the museum 's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five - ring circus			1
but only circus freaks ( and by that we mean " enthusiasts " ) will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of @entity120 's 40 - inch - tall sidekick , general @entity136			0
the @entity137 there 's more than one theory about the assassination of @entity141 , so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well ? most @entity145 buffs are familiar with the @entity146 housed in the former @entity147 , which recounts all those boring " mainstream " details of the late president 's life leading up to his death at the hands of @entity153			1
but just down the street , the @entity137 offers fodder for those less apt to buy into @entity159 's propaganda			0
for the most part , the museum specializes in showings of the @entity164 film and explanations of contrary assassination theories , including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement			1
the @entity170 take two trips to the @entity170 and call us when you 've lost all faith in the medical profession			1
thanks to curator @entity181 ( who recently donated the collection to the @entity170 ) , those in search of history 's quack science can find what they 're looking for in the @entity185 tourist attraction , whether it 's a collection of 19th - century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers			0
if you make the trip , be sure to check out the 1930s @entity190			0
this clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies , sans head , in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process			0
@entity200 's @entity199 what began as a training facility for @entity200 's @entity203 exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest			1
at @entity200 's @entity199 in @entity211 , @entity212 , visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats , cockroaches , mice , spiders , and termites ... all for free			0
and while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them , museum exhibits such as the crowd - pleasing @entity220 keep reeling in patrons			1
@entity225 so , what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville ? the @entity225 , of course -- where dummies go to die			1
the @entity234 , @entity235 , museum was the brainchild of the late @entity238 , who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets			1
in fact , he collected figures from some of the country 's most famous ventriloquist acts			0
and with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling , you 're bound to feel like you 're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one			1
but sadly , when @entity253 gave the tour , you could totally tell his mouth was moving			0
the @entity257 @entity258 was n't kidding when she said one man 's trash is another man 's treasure			1
at the @entity257 in @entity263 , @entity123 , the @entity257 ( @entity257 ) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment ! @entity266 our the @entity267 or visit the old - fashioned town dump			0
and for your recycler - in - training , head across the state to the @entity274 's @entity257 , where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile , get a glimpse of the 1 - ton @entity279 , or enjoy the company of resident compost worms			0
