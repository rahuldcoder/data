it 's the stuff you might expect only to see on tv or in movies -- the upbeat kind with happy endings			2
thankfully , that is just what happened in @entity8 , @entity9 -- the @entity9 city that 's home to @entity10 and @entity12 studios -- as a toddler fell from three stories up into a stranger 's arms and onto a box spring mattress			1
" it feels like i watched a tv show , like it did n't happen to me , " @entity18 , who identified himself as the man who caught the child and fell with him , told @entity23 affiliate @entity21			1
sunday was moving day for @entity26 and wife @entity27 , a typically exhausting if not momentous endeavor			0
until , that is , they spied a youngster hanging out of a third - story window of an apartment building and called 911			1
according to @entity8 fire capt. @entity36 , calls for help came shortly after 5:30 p.m. ( 8:30 p.m. et ) , after witnesses saw the child crawling out of the window			1
it was placed under the window , and although @entity36 did not name the @entity43 , the @entity41 said it was their mattress and @entity18 's arms that came to the rescue			2
the toddler fell only to be caught , and together the toddler and the catcher fell onto the box spring			1
@entity51 told @entity21 that the whole episode " did n't seem real until he was hanging from ( a ) chord , because there was no way he was going to get back			0
" it was then , she added , that the couple threw down their box spring mattress			1
" it ( was ) now up to @entity18 to catch him , " @entity51 added			0
that 's exactly what @entity18 said he did , putting his arms around the falling child " and lower ( ing ) him real fast to the box spring			1
" photos taken a short time later and posted on @entity71 showed a man -- clad in a t - shirt , shorts and no shoes -- cradling what appeared to be his child on the box spring			1
another shows the same man carrying the child , surrounded by toys like @entity82 and @entity84 dolls and as @entity51 holds the box spring upright			1
