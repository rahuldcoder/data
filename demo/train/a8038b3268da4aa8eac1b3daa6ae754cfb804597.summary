@entity0 , @entity1 -- like everyone else , @entity3 watched the riveting drama unfold in a @entity7 hotel as a desperate woman burst into a dining room filled with journalists , sobbing , screaming , wanting the world to know she had been raped by 15 of @entity13 's militia men			1
the arresting images of how swiftly the woman , @entity14 , 29 , and the journalists were stifled stirred viewers around the world			1
but perhaps none more so than @entity21			0
just weeks before , @entity21 might have wept in silence			0
but now , with war engulfing @entity1 and its future hanging in the balance , @entity21 feared @entity13 no more			1
" if i were to see his face , i would strangle him , " she told @entity2 in an interview at her modest home in the eastern coastal city of @entity0			1
this is where she raised her 10 children with her husband , a retired customs agent			0
as a little girl , @entity38 looked out over the deep blue waters of the @entity41 , calling on the oil tankers to carry her away to @entity43			0
she loved languages , most of all @entity43			0
@entity21 recalled her daughter wanting always to be a journalist , but , discouraged by the lack of press freedoms under @entity13 , she opted instead to study law in @entity7 and make a better life			1
she was living with her sister when she was , as she claimed , held against her will for two days , beaten and raped			0
@entity21 said she believes her daughter 's every word , despite attempts by the @entity13 regime to discredit her			1
the @entity1 government first said @entity38 was mentally ill and drunk			1
they called her a prostitute			0
later , it changed its story and said @entity38 was sane enough to withstand legal proceedings			0
@entity1 government spokesman @entity61 said the men accused of raping @entity38 are being investigated , but the suspects , in turn , have filed counter-charges for slander			1
the attempt to discredit @entity38 as a promiscuous , un-islamic woman ties into the idea of sexual shaming in a conservative @entity72 society where it 's commonly believed that a woman who has been raped has lost her honor , said @entity76 , a columnist on @entity78 and @entity72 issues			1
for a woman in such a society to come forward to claim she has been raped is no small thing			1
" no one would do that unless they were raped , and especially in a conservative society , " @entity82 told @entity2			1
@entity88 's act ended up being as significant as the discontented fruit vendor in @entity90 who set himself afire and sparked revolt in the entire region , @entity82 said			1
the way @entity38 spoke out was unprecedented and she has already been hailed a hero on social networking sites			0
@entity21 said she received a call sunday from a man who offered her a bribe to reject @entity101 's claims and persuade her daughter to change her tale			1
she stands by her daughter , she said			1
so does her entire family and tribe			0
to show their support , the family held an in - absentia engagement ceremony for @entity101 at a mosque in @entity0 monday			0
no one here thinks she has lost her honor			0
the government said @entity38 was freed but she has not been seen publicly since she was dragged away by security men and bundled into a waiting white car outside the @entity118 saturday			1
@entity21 has not heard from her daughter and challenged @entity13 to air video of her on state television as proof of her well - being			1
@entity21 said she was also worried about her other daughter			2
no one has apparently seen her either since saturday			2
a group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach @entity38 's sister 's house monday , but were blocked by security forces			2
the sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in @entity7 told @entity2			2
@entity136 's story raced around the world after she stormed into the @entity118 as international journalists were having breakfast saturday morning			1
she showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh			0
she said she had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men			0
her visible injuries appeared to support her claims , but @entity2 could not independently verify @entity101 's story			2
" look at what @entity13 's brigades did to me , " she said			1
" my honor was violated by them			0
" @entity136 displayed what appeared to be rope burns on her wrists and ankles			1
government officials tried to subdue her , but she persisted			2
even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife			2
" traitor ! " he shouted			0
another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head			0
one government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt			2
others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment			0
some journalists were beaten and kicked			0
@entity2 's camera was confiscated and smashed beyond repair			2
as security forces dragged her away , @entity38 warned : " if you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it			2
" @entity21 said she has not been able to stop crying			0
she has n't slept or eaten			0
she sees only her daughter 's distress shared so publicly at a pivotal moment of her nation 's history			1
@entity2 's @entity189 and @entity190 contributed to this report			2

@entity14 's *mother* says she could strangle @entity13 for her daughter 's *mistreatment*
the @entity1 government tries to discredit her as un-islamic
@entity136 has not been seen in public since saturday 's *incident*
it 's no small thing for a woman to claim rape in a conservative @entity72 society , *analyst* says
