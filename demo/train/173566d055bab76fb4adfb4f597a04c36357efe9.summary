-- monday is @entity1 , and the day i have chosen to " come out " as transgender			2
we are all assigned a gender at birth			1
sometimes that assignment does n't match our inner truth , and there needs to be a new place -- a place for self - identification			0
i was not born a boy , i was assigned boy at birth			1
understanding the difference between the two is crucial to our culture and society moving forward in in the way we treat -- and talk about -- transgender individuals			2
one of my earliest memories is from 5 years old			0
i used to drape t - shirts on my head , and would delight in feeling the fabric on my back			0
my mom asked me , " why do you always wear a t - shirt on your head ? " i responded , " it 's not a t - shirt , @entity32 -- this is my hair			0
" growing up the @entity34 , i was involved in transgender beauty pageants from the age of 15			2
in @entity40 cultures , the fluidity of gender has been part of life for thousands of years , evidenced by the @entity43 of compassion , @entity45 and the @entity47 hijra goddess , @entity46 , who is sacred to men who want to be cured of impotence , and to women wanting to become pregnant			2
yet despite this nuanced understanding , and despite the pageant culture i grew up in , in many countries , fluidity is celebrated but not politically recognized			0
a personal turning point came in 2005 , a year before i became a @entity57 citizen , when i was traveling through @entity58			1
back then , i still had my @entity34 passport and my former male gender marker , but i presented as a woman			1
i was taken into the immigration office at the airport and questioned for hours about my identity			0
i have friends in the @entity34 -- where there is no law that allows them to change their name and marker -- that have these experiences every time they travel			1
when i first moved to the @entity57 to work as a model , and i finally had the opportunity to change my name and gender marker , i felt as though my outside self finally matched my inner truth			1
i really felt like i 'd made it but , over time , i realized that there 's a lot of work that needs to be done and that i was only just beginning			0
today i am launching @entity83 , which envisions a world where transgender individuals are able to self - identify with the fewest possible barriers			1
in most of the western world , conceptions of gender remain very rigid , but that exists alongside progressive legal systems that afford transgender individuals some limited rights			1
there are varying differences of understanding between eastern and @entity98 cultures , and i hope @entity83 can create a new understanding			0
we are partnering with all out to identify countries where legislation is at a " tipping point , " and we plan to funnel resources to on - the - ground activists and organizations working to create change			2
there 's a long history of people within the community who stood up and fought for justice			2
i was inspired by the trailblazers , such as @entity115 and @entity116 and by organizations , including the @entity118 in the @entity34 , @entity119 , @entity120 , among others			0
i believe that a more mature and in - depth contemplation of the subject of transgender will be the bridge that leads humanity to a deeper understanding of gender as a whole			1
this deeper understanding begins with the realization that we live in a culture that assigned us gender at birth and that the appropriate roles and expectations of our gender are defined by our society and our culture			1
in today 's globally connected and ever - diversifying world , culture is now more fluid and more flexible than ever -- and so too should be our understanding and perception of gender			0
