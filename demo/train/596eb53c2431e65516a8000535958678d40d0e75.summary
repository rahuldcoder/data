@entity19 set the record of a 10 - point halfway lead in 2010 , but the third - placed defending champions can only close the gap to 11 by winning at @entity24 on sunday			1
@entity2 , who won a record opening eight matches of this season , had hoped to put on a show to match the planned post-game " thank you " party for the 71,000 fans at the @entity33 , but @entity8 killed the mood by taking the lead in the 21st minute			1
@entity37 fired home from the penalty spot after @entity2 defender @entity40 handled a cross by @entity42 in the visitors ' first real attack of the match			2
@entity2 drop points in @entity19 draw " i do n't know how the referee could class that as a penalty , " @entity40 told reporters			1
" i seriously do n't think it was justified			0
i think we deserved to win			0
" @entity2 lost $ 52 million august signing @entity54 to injury before halftime , but it was the @entity61 midfielder 's replacement @entity58 who netted the equalizer			0
@entity11 -- who was born in @entity63 and also played for and managed the club -- also brought on last season 's top scorer @entity65 for his early - season replacement @entity68 just 11 minutes after the break			0
@entity70 striker @entity65 , who missed three months with injury , helped make space for @entity58 -- who took advantage of a slip by @entity37 to fire in a left - foot shot at the near post just before an hour 's play			0

@entity8 held on to move up to sixth place as @entity2 dropped points for just the fourth time this season , having lost only once			2
@entity2 will begin the four - week winter break following tuesday 's @entity85 last - 16 trip to @entity5 strugglers @entity92 on tuesday			1
the match may be a further test for @entity68 , who scored nine league goals before @entity65 returned from ankle surgery in mid-november -- but none since			0
@entity65 , who matched the @entity101 forward 's three goals at @entity102 , has netted three times in seven appearances since his return .			0
