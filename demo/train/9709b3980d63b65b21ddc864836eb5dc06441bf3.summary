@entity0 -- the @entity2 approved a plan friday that would pave the way for an eventual repeal of the military 's controversial " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , which bars openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service			1
the measure passed in a largely party - line , 229 - 186 vote as part of a larger defense authorization bill despite a growing controversy over allegations of wasteful spending in the legislation			1
most @entity20 backed the bill while most republicans opposed it			0
attention now shifts to the @entity24 , where the @entity25 approved a " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal earlier in the week			1
as in the @entity2 , the committee was divided sharply along partisan lines			2
the plan is a compromise under which the repeal would occur only after a military review of the question and subsequent approval by @entity35 , the defense secretary and the chairman of the @entity37			1
opponents of the repeal language argue the military should first carry out the review ordered by defense secretary @entity42 that is scheduled to be completed in december			0
only then would military leaders have the necessary information from force members to develop a plan for carrying out the repeal , they claim			2
under the compromise , the military would be given time to complete its review as sought by @entity53 and the chairman of the @entity37 , adm. @entity54			0
@entity42 and @entity54 both said this week they could accept the compromise language			0
a recent @entity1 poll seemed to suggest that @entity58 are ready for the change			0
the @entity61 survey released tuesday indicated that 78 percent of the public supports allowing openly gay people to serve in the military , with one in five opposed			0
threatening to derail the plan , however , is @entity2 members ' insistence on spending almost $ 500 million on a fighter engine that neither the @entity69 nor the @entity70 wants			1
funding for the engine was included in the @entity2 's version of the legislation but not the @entity24 's			2
a @entity69 spokesman warned before the @entity2 vote on friday that president @entity35 would veto the bill if funding for the engine is n't removed			1
@entity42 has blasted the proposed funding for the extra @entity80 engine , calling it a " waste of money " that does n't meet the fighter 's performance needs			0
the chairman of the @entity25 said friday that he hopes @entity35 would n't veto the plan if @entity88 failed to remove the controversial funding			1
" it 's difficult to believe the president would do anything other than look at the entire bill , not just one provision , " said sen. @entity90 , @entity91			0
@entity90 would n't predict if the engine funding would still be in the bill by the time it reaches @entity35 's desk			1
" we are a long way from having a product , " he said			0
" some of the things which i would think ( @entity35 ) may not like may be dropped along the way			2
" supporters of repealing the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy have been pressuring congressional @entity20 to act now , fearing the party will lose its @entity2 or @entity24 majority in november 's midterm election and be unable to pass the measure afterward			1
the compromise emerged late monday from a meeting at the @entity69 involving administration officials , gay rights groups and @entity70 officials , sources told @entity1			1
there were also talks on @entity121 involving @entity69 lawyers , @entity70 officials and staff from the offices of influential @entity2 and @entity24 @entity20 , including house speaker @entity125 , the sources added			1
a senior @entity58 military official with direct knowledge of the @entity70 review process told @entity1 it is well under way , with a survey going out shortly to about 70,000 troops and families to solicit their views			2
in addition , the official said , town hall meetings already have been held around the country and more are expected , while a website provides a place for troops to write in their views			0
the military needs until the end of 2010 to figure out how to implement the repeal in terms of housing , medical and marriage benefits , as well as issues involving the reinstatement of gay soldiers previously discharged under the policy , the official said			2
a major problem might be determining how to reconcile the repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell " with federal law that defines marriage as between a man a woman , the official added			0
@entity1 's @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 contributed to this report			0
