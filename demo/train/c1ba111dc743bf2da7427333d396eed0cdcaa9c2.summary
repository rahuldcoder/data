@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's 6:30 a.m. , and @entity4 is chatting with his friends over a breakfast buffet of eggs , bacon and fresh fruit			1
dressed in a dark gray blazer , @entity4 waits to take his seat in the @entity13 's auditorium for a special concert by the @entity15			2
but the musicians are n't playing for @entity4 and his friends			2
they 're playing for @entity18 , @entity19 and the rest of the " @entity22 " cast			1
once the violins sound and the cameras start rolling , @entity4 will merely fade into the background , along with the other 300 movie extras on set			1
the 55 - year - old first started working as an extra in november 2010 to provide for his family amid the downturn of his ad sales career			1
since losing his job in april , he 's become a staple on movie and tv sets around @entity1 -- and he 's not the only one			1
many of the " concertgoers " present at the shoot for " @entity22 , " due out in november 2012 , were between jobs , or looking for a fun way to make extra ( pun intended ) cash			1
the recession definitely pushed some people into extra work , said @entity47 , a commercial and independent film producer who leads a workshop called " how to be an @entity49 and on @entity50			1
" @entity51 said half the class is usually made up of recent graduates with a passion for acting , while the other 50 % are " people who lost their jobs and love movies and tv			1
" " if you 're not working at all , " she said , " and if you do n't qualify for unemployment ... you 're going to make more money on set than you are in your house filling out job applications			1
there 's so much downtime on set			2
it allows you time to read or look for those jobs online with your smartphone			1
" and while extra work makes a great supplemental income , @entity51 said treating it like a full time job -- as @entity4 has for the past year -- might be financially challenging			1
movie extras in @entity1 typically make between $ 58 and $ 101.50 for an 8 - to 12 - hour day			1
compare that to the $ 140 an extra makes in @entity77 or @entity78 for the same 8 hours			1
@entity81 rates are higher than the non-union wages extras are entitled to in @entity1 , casting director @entity79 said			1
" if you 're hiring somebody at minimum wage ... they might not show , " he added			2
extras are asked to drive to set , bring different outfits , and then pay to have those outfits dry - cleaned -- it would end up costing them money to be there , he said			1
but beyond the commitment , @entity79 said there 's " little skill involved in being a movie extra			1
... it 's all based on a look , and then whatever skills you may have			0
" and @entity4 certainly has a look			0
like the extra says , " my eyebrows are what 's making me the money			1
" " he 's just a character , " @entity79 said			0
" you ca n't help but look at him			0
he has an interesting face			0
" @entity79 originally planned to use @entity4 as a stand - in for @entity109 on " @entity110 , " but despite the men 's equally bushy brows , they were n't close enough in height			1
instead , @entity4 plays a caterer in the film , which will hit theaters in april 2012			0
in addition to height , skin tone , hair color and , in some cases , eyebrows , movie extras need an appropriate wardrobe			1
the orchestra scene for the @entity126 - starrer called for conservative , upscale dress -- hence @entity4 's gray blazer and button - down shirt			2
" i probably have about seven suits from being a salesman , " @entity4 said			0
" that 's the number one thing you need as a guy my age			0
a guy in his 50s is always playing a businessman			0
" but a fancy suit is n't always a good thing			0
" extras run the risk of being seen in front of the camera when their wardrobe is so damn glamorous , " @entity79 said			2
and though it seems like a close - up would be welcomed by movie extras , to be invited back to set , which means another paycheck , extras need to remain hidden in the background			1
" you ca n't make a movie with the same extras , " @entity79 explained			1
viewers would notice if the person playing a bartender showed up in the next scene as a lawyer			0
that 's why @entity51 teaches her extras to lay low on set			2
do n't be so dramatic that you become a distraction , she warns			0
the other rule ? avoid wearing clothes that do n't translate well on film			0
that means any small pattern , and colors like red , black and white			0
since @entity4 has been on the extra scene , he 's appeared in more than 20 productions			2
some of which are " @entity179 , " " @entity110 , " " the @entity180 " and @entity182 's " @entity181			0
" and he had a speaking role in august 's " @entity184 " -- he played an " amalgamated attorney			0
" a speaking role is the extra @entity187			2
it means a significant pay increase , too			0
despite such opportunities , @entity4 says it 's not a glamorous job			0
he once heard a crew member say , ' here comes the furniture , ' when the extras walked on set			2
" i need the money so bad , i ca n't miss a day on set , " @entity4 said , calling extra work the lowest paying job he 'll ever love			1
but the work does n't dictate every extra 's livelihood			1
@entity202 , an usher at the @entity13 , is someone @entity79 refers to as a specialty extra			2
no stranger to the role , @entity202 was asked to play an usher in " @entity22			1
" " we used the real ushers ... because they know how to walk			0
we do n't have to teach them how to walk			0
... they gesture with their hands a certain way , " @entity79 said			0
and the same goes for basketball players , nurses , ballerinas , waiters and so on			0
" [ @entity217 ] are used to standing on their feet			0
... they carry a tray a certain way			0
... to me , that 's a skill , " @entity79 said			0
" i 'll give you an extra $ 20 , $ 50 because you 're a real waiter			1
... the director wo n't have to say ' cut ' to some knucklehead who does n't even know how to carry a tray			0
" @entity202 , who filmed a scene with @entity126 that could make it to the big screen , said the ushers were given film - friendly uniforms to wear for the shoot			1
usually dressed in white shirts , red vests and black bow ties -- the three most distracting colors to shoot -- the ushers in the film were provided with blue shirts and black vests and ties for the scene			0
another first - time extra , @entity245 , took time off from teaching preschool to appear as a concertgoer in the film			1
@entity245 , who acted in high school and college , said she was curious to see how movies are made , and what being an extra was all about			2
but at the end of the shoot , when @entity245 heads back to the classroom , extras like @entity4 , who are hoping to make it in the biz , will move on to the next set			1
there are so many possible ways to earn money in the film industry , @entity51 says , " [ extra work ] is the easiest way to get in the door when you do n't have experience , " she added			1
" it has helped [ people ] move into better paying positions and find a whole new career			2
" " there 's no doubt i love being in front of the camera , " @entity4 said			0
" but i 'm starting to discover ... that i could probably write a script			0
... down the line i could see it			0
" for now , he says , his goal is to make a decent living and support his family doing this .			2
