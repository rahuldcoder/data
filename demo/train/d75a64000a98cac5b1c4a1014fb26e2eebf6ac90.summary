he may be world number one and with the @entity13 just around the corner , but the @entity15 wants this particular title in his trophy cabinet for the first time and showed his typical steel to see off the dangerous @entity20 thursday in the quarterfinals			2

" i 'm just thinking about @entity42 at the moment and not looking ahead to the @entity13			0
" @entity10 lost in the 2010 final to @entity45 and has found it hard to produce his best form in the season - opener , but with three wins under his belt this time around at the @entity51 , he does indeed look well set for a crack at a 14th grand slam title later this month			2
he will now play qualifier @entity54 , who earlier beat dreadlocked @entity56 7 - 5 in the third set tie - breaker in an all - @entity59 encounter			1
the other semifinal will pit @entity61 , who beat third seed @entity62 in the second round , against @entity64 of @entity65			0
@entity59 's @entity61 survived a lengthy three - setter against @entity67 , eventually beating the @entity68 6 - 4 6 - 7 6 - 4			1
@entity64 , who followed @entity10 on court , breezed past @entity59 @entity70 6 - 2 6 - 1 in just 48 minutes in impressive style			2
in other @entity75 action , @entity73 veteran @entity72 upset sixth seed @entity76 7 - 5 6 - 3 to reach the last eight of the @entity79			1
the former @entity81 champion battled back from 5 - 3 in the opener to claim victory in one hour and 39 minutes			0
he will face @entity68 qualifier @entity84 , who caused an upset as he ousted third seed @entity87 7 - 5 6 - 3 in 88 minutes , for a place in the semifinals			1
@entity10 's great rival @entity90 is top seed at the @entity13 warm - up event .			0
