-- march 3 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 and @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : the earthquake in @entity4 was so powerful , it might have affected time ! i 'm @entity19			1
you 're tuned in to @entity0 ! first up : @entity20 @entity21 : aftershocks , still rumbling across parts of @entity4			1
at least a dozen were recorded from monday to tuesday			2
this quake left thousands of residents without food , without water , without electricity and other just basic services			0
yesterday morning , the country 's president said that all emergency measures should be in place by the end of the day			2
of course , the international community is pitching in , too			0
secretary of state @entity36 arrived in @entity4 tuesday , bringing along some supplies and promising that more help is on the way			1
secretary @entity36 also praised @entity4 for how prepared it was to respond to this kind of disaster and for how well the nation has responded so far			1
so , what 's with that point we mentioned at the beginning of the show about the earthquake affecting time ? well , according to one scientist , the quake was so powerful it 's possible that it affected the @entity54 's rotation			2
based on this scientist 's calculations , it should have shortened the length of a day by one - and - a - quarter microseconds			1
of course , this is the second major quake to strike recently			0
@entity61 suffered a 7.0 - magnitude quake in january			1
and while that tremor was n't as powerful as the one in @entity4 , the devastation that it caused seems to have been significantly worse			1
@entity65 examines some of the reasons why			0
( begin video ) @entity68 , @entity0 correspondent : the quake in @entity61 was a 7.0 , killing more than 200,000 people			1
the quake in @entity4 registered 8.8 , as much as 800 times stronger			1
the death toll less than a thousand so far			0
why is that ? geography , for one thing			0
the @entity77 quake was in shallow earth , 15 miles from the city			0
the @entity4 quake was 30 miles off the coast , deep under water			1
no one alive remembers the series of earthquakes that hit @entity61 in the 1700s			1
but @entity4 's experience is much more recent ; more than 28 quakes in the 20th century , including the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in 1960			1
all of which has led @entity4 to put in and adhere to strict building codes			1
@entity4 learned its lessons the hard way , making engineering the biggest factor of all that sets @entity4 and @entity61 apart			1
( @entity96 ) @entity98 ambassador @entity21 : moving to the @entity99 now			0
@entity5 has selected an ambassador to @entity6 for the first time in two decades			0
here 's some background on this for you : @entity6 borders @entity5 to the south			2
and in august of 1990 , @entity5 invaded @entity6			0
that led to " @entity107 ; " part of the @entity107 , when a @entity110 - led coalition liberated @entity6 from @entity5 in 1991			2
@entity5 was controlled by @entity111 back then			0
and since he was removed from power in 2003 , @entity5 and @entity6 have been building ties			0
this week 's announcement is the latest step in that process			2
@entity118 @entity119 , @entity15 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm a government agency that dates back to colonial times			0
i was first run by @entity125			0
according to my unofficial motto , " neither snow nor rain nor heat " will keep my couriers from delivering the mail			0
i 'm the @entity132 , and my funding does n't come from tax dollars , only from the money my business makes			1
@entity137 @entity21 : that business is n't doing so well			0
at the end of last september , the @entity132 was $ 10 billion in debt ! and the agency says it could lose more than $ 200 billion in the next 10 years unless it is allowed to make some changes			1
this is why we say " allowed " : the @entity132 is an independent agency , but @entity144 controls how it does business			1
and lawmakers would have to approve some of the changes that the @entity132 is considering			1
among those , no more mail delivery on saturdays			0
plus , the service would look to close some branches and raise some of its prices			0
the postmaster general , the man who runs the @entity132 , says that it 'll take a big effort to turn things around			1
@entity159 , @entity110 postmaster general : if we make the changes that are necessary , we can continue to provide universal service for @entity110 for decades to come			0
but there are some very significant changes that are gon na have to be made to the service that we offer and to the way we conduct our business on a daily basis			0
@entity170 @entity21 : recalls : we 've heard about a lot of those recently			0
now , @entity110 carmaker @entity175 , @entity175 , is making a recall that affects 1.3 million vehicles in the @entity110 , @entity178 and @entity179			2
the problem : a potential failure in the cars ' power steering			0
@entity175 started investigating this problem more than a year ago			0
the company says it develops over time , so it 's more likely to affect vehicles that have been driven 20,000 to 30,000 miles			2
@entity175 says it 's working on a solution to all of this			2
in the meantime , a company spokesman says the recall is " the right thing to do for our customers ' peace of mind			0
" @entity197 @entity198 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity202 's @entity201 classes at @entity203 in @entity204 , @entity205 ! in what country would you find the world 's fastest train ? is it : a ) @entity7 , b ) @entity211 , c ) @entity213 or @entity214 ) @entity110 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the world 's fastest train zooms through @entity7 at well over 200 miles per hour			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity219 @entity21 : with the largest population in the world -- 1.3 billion people -- @entity7 is making a huge investment in helping those folks get around the country by rail			1
now , trains might sound kind of old school ; you might think stagecoaches or something like that			0
but modern railways pollute less than planes ; they 're far faster than cars			0
building them takes money , though			0
and in @entity7 's case , we 're talking about stimulus money			1
@entity242 reports from the railways			0
( begin video ) @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 : @entity247 's newest train station looks like a modern airport , and a ride on its bullet train is nearly as fast as taking a plane			1
@entity7 's high - speed trains have come a long way from the steam engines that once chugged into the capital before economic reforms in the 1980s transformed long - distance transportation			1
this is how the majority of people travel across @entity7			1
old trains like this go as slow as 55 kilometers per hour			0
when it 's crowded , it 's standing room only and the journey can take days			2
but that 's no longer the only option			2
@entity7 is now home to the world 's fastest train , hurtling from @entity272 to @entity273 at more than 350 kilometers per hour			1
this train is so fast , it 's threatened airline ticket sales			2
@entity276 is struggling to compete on this particular route as high - speed railways change the way @entity7 people travel across this vast country			1
@entity7 is spinning a web of high - speed railways with faster connections than ever before			1
the government plans to extend 3,000 current kilometers of high - speed track to 12,000 by 2012			1
estimated cost : $ 360 billion @entity110 , or 60 % of the stimulus package @entity7 enacted to combat the financial crisis			1
@entity291 , @entity292 : if you 're investing in a high - speed railway system , you 're sending checks to two million workers that are involved in the railway industry			1
so , that 's a very easy call to make , politically			2
chang : @entity7 's rail system is now arguably the most advanced in the world			1
@entity110 company @entity302 is collaborating with @entity247 on technology to modernize @entity110 's own aging rail network			1
while nowhere close to @entity7 's investment , president @entity305 has committed $ 8 billion to high - speed rail			1
@entity110 president @entity305 : our nation has always been built to compete			0
there 's no reason @entity312 or @entity7 should have the fastest trains			1
chang : just like interstate highways transformed the @entity110 , faster trains in @entity7 will bring infrastructure , investment and passengers to destinations deep in the countryside			1
critics counter @entity7 is overbuilding and that tickets on fast trains are too expensive for average citizens			1
but with living standards rising , more and more will be able and willing to pay to satisfy the need for speed			2
@entity242 , @entity0 , @entity247			0
( @entity96 ) @entity328 @entity21 : march is @entity328			0
and we 're helping students recognize the achievements of women with our free @entity328 materials			2
these @entity334 and activities help students explore the roles of women in fields like science , government and sports			2
you can find the free resources in the @entity346 section -- you know where to go -- @entity349			2
before we go @entity21 : and finally , we 're digging up some dirt on a man who lives in @entity352			0
and @entity354 likes tulips ... a lot ! he plants 3,200 of them every year , and then sits back and watches his yard turn into a budding botanical garden			0
to most people , the retired teacher is simply known as " the @entity362			0
" @entity354 spends hundreds of hours planning and planting every year			0
some people might think it 's sort of a silly tradition			2
goodbye @entity21 : but you wo n't hear something like that from our two lips			0
we hope you will return and watch us again then			0

consider the *difference* in impact of earthquakes in @entity4 and @entity61
find out why the @entity132 might be making some changes
take a ride on @entity7 's high - speed rail system , the fastest in the world
