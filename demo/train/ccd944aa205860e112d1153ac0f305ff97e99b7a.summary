last month 's @entity1 decision in the landmark @entity3 immigration case was groundbreaking for what it omitted : the words " illegal immigrants " and " illegal aliens , " except when quoting other sources			1
the court 's nonjudgmental language established a humanistic approach to our current restructuring of immigration policy			0
when you label someone an " illegal alien " or " illegal immigrant " or just plain " illegal , " you are effectively saying the individual , as opposed to the actions the person has taken , is unlawful			1
the terms imply the very existence of an unauthorized migrant in @entity25 is criminal			1
in this country , there is still a presumption of innocence that requires a jury to convict someone of a crime			0
if you do n't pay your taxes , are you an illegal ? what if you get a speeding ticket ? a murder conviction ? no. you 're still not an illegal			2
even alleged terrorists and child molesters are n't labeled illegals			0
by becoming judge , jury and executioner , you dehumanize the individual and generate animosity toward them			0
@entity48 editorial writer @entity47 says " illegal " is often " a code word for racial and ethnic hatred			2
" the term " illegal immigrant " was first used in 1939 as a slur by the @entity54 toward @entity55 who were fleeing the @entity56 and entering @entity57 without authorization			1
@entity60 survivor and @entity62 winner @entity59 aptly said that " no human being is illegal			2
" @entity64 : " illegal immigrant " is the uncomfortable truth migrant workers residing unlawfully in the @entity25 are not -- and never have been -- criminals			1
they are subject to deportation , through a civil administrative procedure that differs from criminal prosecution , and where judges have wide discretion to allow certain foreign nationals to remain here			1
news : for immigrants and opponents , court 's ruling hits their real lives another misconception is that the vast majority of migrant workers currently out of status sneak across our southern border in the middle of the night			2
actually , almost half enter the @entity25 with a valid tourist or work visa and overstay their allotted time			1
many go to school , find a job , get married and start a family			0
and some even join the @entity95 , like @entity97 @entity96 , who was the first combat veteran to die in the @entity98			0
while he was granted @entity25 citizenship posthumously , there are another 38,000 non-citizens in uniform , including undocumented immigrants , defending our country			1
justice @entity106 , writing for the majority , joined by chief justice @entity109 and three other justices , stated : " as a general rule , it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the @entity25			1
" the court also ruled that it was not a crime to seek or engage in unauthorized employment			0
as @entity106 explained , removal of an unauthorized migrant is a civil matter where even if the person is out of status , federal officials have wide discretion to determine whether deportation makes sense			0
for example , if an unauthorized person is trying to support his family by working or has " children born in the @entity25 , long ties to the community , or a record of distinguished military service , " officials may let him stay			1
also , if individuals or their families might be politically persecuted or harmed upon return to their country of origin , they may also remain in the @entity25			1
while the @entity1 has chosen language less likely to promote hatred and divisiveness , journalists continue using racially offensive language			1
@entity147 journalism professor @entity146 conducted a study of 122,000 news stories published between 2000 and 2010 , to determine which terms are being used to describe foreign nationals in the @entity25 who are out of status			1
he found that 89 % of the time during this period , journalists used the biased terms " illegal immigrant " and " illegal alien			1
" @entity146 discovered that there was a substantial increase in the use of the term " illegal immigrant , " which he correlated back to the @entity164 's decision in 2004 to recommend " illegal immigrant " to its members			1
( it 's the preferred term at @entity167 and the @entity48 as well			2
) the @entity164 is the decisive authority on word use at virtually all mainstream daily newspapers , and it 's used by editors at television , radio and electronic news media			0
according to the @entity175 , this term is " accurate and neutral			2
" for the @entity175 to claim that " illegal immigrant " is " accurate and neutral " is like @entity177 's giving @entity179 's hedge fund a triple - a rating for safety and creditworthiness			1
it 's almost as if the @entity175 were following the script of pollster and @entity188 contributor @entity186 , considered the foremost @entity190 expert on crafting the perfect conservative political message			0
in 2005 , he produced a 25 - page secret memorandum that would radically alter the immigration debate to distort public perception of the issue			0
the secret memorandum almost perfectly captures @entity198 's position on immigration -- along with that of every anti-immigrant politician and conservative pundit			0
for maximum impact , @entity186 urges republicans to offer fearful rhetoric : " this is about overcrowding of your schools , emergency room chaos in your hospitals , the increase in your taxes , and the crime in your communities			0
" he also encourages them to talk about " border security , " because after 9/11 , this " argument does well among all voters -- even hardcore @entity219 , " as it conjures up the specter of terrorism			0
@entity231 's classic " @entity230 " shows how even a free society is susceptible to manipulation by overdosing on worn - out prefabricated phrases that convert people into lifeless dummies , who become easy prey for the political class			1
news : for immigrant graduates , a ' leap of faith has been answered , ' educator says in " @entity230 , " @entity231 creates a character named @entity237 who i find eerily similar to @entity186			2
@entity237 is a fast - talking word genius in the research department of the @entity241			0
he invents doublespeak for @entity243 and edits the @entity244 by destroying words that might lead to " thoughtcrimes			0
" @entity247 contains the doublespeak words with political implications that will spread in speakers ' minds like a poison			2
in @entity186 's book " @entity255 , " @entity253 lists " the 21 political words and phrases you should never say again			2
" for example , destroy " undocumented worker " and instead say " illegal immigrant , " because " the label " you use " determines the attitudes people have toward them			1
" and the poison is effective			0
surely it 's no coincidence that in 2010 , hate crimes against @entity269 made up 66 % of the violence based on ethnicity , up from 45 % in 2009 , according to the @entity272			0
in his essay " @entity279 , " @entity231 warned that one must be constantly on guard against a ready - made phrase that " anaesthetizes a portion of one 's brain			0
" but @entity231 also wrote that " from time to time one can even , if one jeers loudly enough , send some worn - out and useless phrase ... into the dustbin , where it belongs " -- just like the @entity25 @entity1 did			1
follow @ @entity286 on twitter			0

@entity289 : @entity1 majority was wise to avoid term " illegal immigrant "
the term *suggests* that individuals , rather than actions , are unlawful , he says
he says foreign nationals residing unlawfully in the @entity25 are not criminals
*repetition* of phrases like " illegal immigrant " is like a poison that *infects* society , @entity289 says
