-- after all the arrests , court appearances , trips to jail and rehab stays , @entity1 has turned to reality tv			1
on sunday night , the 27 - year - old made her latest comeback attempt in the @entity11 network 's " @entity1 , " a docu - series that came across in its first episode as part " @entity15 @entity16 " and part " intervention , " with a dash of " @entity19			1
" ( @entity1 , apparently , gets rid of nothing			2
) the premise is to follow @entity1 around as she tries to piece her personal and professional life back together after six years of documented turmoil			2
and so last summer , less than a week after she completed a 90 - day stay at a @entity26 rehab facility -- a place that actually aired commercials during the show -- @entity1 sat down with @entity11 's @entity30 for an interview and began filming			1
the trailer indicated that there would be no glossing over @entity1 's flaws and missteps , as crew members and own staff openly commented on the ways @entity1 was making production difficult			1
but in its first hour , viewers did n't get any of that			0
instead , the show tracked the former child star as she messily packed up and moved from @entity46 to @entity47 , tried to find her own place , saw her younger sister walk in a fashion show and squeezed in an impromptu shopping trip			2
her jewelery needed to be organized , and then she needed to change hotel rooms			0
other than a brilliant " fetch " t - shirt being flashed at one point , that was about as exciting as it got			0
yet in the midst of all that minutiae , the core of " @entity1 " is the star 's focus on sobriety			1
@entity1 's numerous low points are tallied throughout the episode , and she 's frequently accompanied by a sober coach			1
if nothing else , @entity11 's " @entity1 " wants to be the portrait of a young artist in recovery			1
does it succeed ? maybe for fans of @entity1 's ( and she does still have them , as " @entity1 " proved by chatting up strangers on the street about the actress ) or the compassionately voyeuristic			1
" i know there r much more important things going on in the world , " media personality @entity80 tweeted sunday , " but i am very curious to see if @entity1 can save herself			1
" in the beginning of the episode , @entity1 at least seemed to be on her way there , saying during a one - on - one confessional that " there 's nothing left in having a drink for me			1
" " there 's no situation that i have n't been exposed to , " she went on			2
" so maybe trying the other way for me , which is living with integrity and living in control of my own self , that 's the life i want now			0
" but when faced with paparazzi , the stress of moving or a lingerie photo shoot that does n't go as planned , the actress appeared on the brink of breaking down			0
for @entity105 's @entity104 , those moments are what makes " @entity1 " worth watching			1
" what ' @entity1 ' succeeds most at is , for the first time in years , convincing us that @entity1 is n't a name in an @entity113 headline or a joke in a late - night monologue or a character in a drama so wild it ca n't possibly be real life , " @entity107 writes			2
" she 's a human			0
she 's a very fragile , volatile , slightly selfish human			0
but she 's one who 's working really hard to find peace in the eye of the very large , very tumultuous storm that surrounds her and is causing those dangerous traits			0
" as for everyone else , there 's little draw outside of the opportunity to sharpen one 's snarky barbs			0
" a small part of me died when i found out this is more than a one episode show , " tweeted @entity130 's tv critic @entity129 , while @entity132 's @entity131 tried to rustle up a silver lining			2
" encouraging sign # 1 , " @entity131 said			0
" she finally got a driver			0
" actress @entity138 , meanwhile , could n't even joke about what she was watching on sunday : " this is just genuinely sad , " she posted on @entity141			0
" @entity1 had to know when she signed up for " @entity142 " that she was leaving herself wide open to this wide - ranging barrage of reactions , especially to comments like the one she made about a past jail stint			2
" the judge at the time that i had kept overruling me getting released even though they were overcrowded , " @entity1 recalled of time spent in solitary confinement			2
" she kept making me stay there			0
what they were doing was punishing me instead of trying to help me			0
" but , even with the possibility of this docu - series experiment going awry , it seems " @entity1 " is worth the risk for the former child star			1
" i 'm trying to figure out how to be sane and live , " she said during sunday 's episode			1
" ( i was ) in this bubble where everything was done for me , and now , i 'm figuring everything out for myself			0
" 7 things from @entity1 's sit down with @entity30 in august			1
