-- an @entity3 inmate , convicted of killing and dismembering a 22 - year - old woman in 1991 , was executed tuesday using a new , untested one - drug method of lethal injection , state officials said			1
@entity7 , 51 , was pronounced dead at 11:47 a.m. at a prison in @entity9 , @entity3 , the state attorney general 's office said in a written statement			1
his last words , according to @entity13 spokeswoman @entity12 , were : " sorry from the bottom of my heart			0
i want to thank all of my family and friends for my prayers and who supported and believed in me			0
" my father , now i 'm being paroled to heaven , " @entity7 said , according to @entity12			2
" i will now spend all of my holidays with my lord and savior , @entity27			0
peace be with you all			0
" @entity7 ' execution is the first in @entity3 since september , when the governor and federal courts halted capital punishment in the state after a botched attempt to execute another prisoner , @entity38			1
the prison staff could not find a suitable vein for the injections			0
the one - drug method had never been tried on a @entity44 death row inmate			1
it relies on a single dose of sodium thiopental injected into a vein			0
a separate two - drug muscle injection was available as a backup , officials said			1
the one - drug method has been used to euthanize animals			1
the same drug , sodium thiopental , at a much lower dosage , is the first ingredient in the three - drug method previously used in @entity3 , as well as in all but one of the other 34 states that allow the death penalty			1
some capital punishment opponents claim the sodium thiopental , which renders the prisoner unconscious , can wear off too quickly , and that some prisoners would actually be awake and able to feel pain as the procedure continues			0
@entity7 ' execution was initially scheduled for 10 a.m. , but preparations were delayed as officials waited for a ruling from the @entity44 @entity72 on @entity7 ' request for a stay , @entity12 said			1
the high court without comment denied the request about 10 a.m. , and " we were about an hour behind " in preparations , she said			1
the execution began around 11 a.m. @entity7 died about 10 minutes after the drugs began to flow , she said , but he was not officially pronounced dead until later			2
@entity7 , 51 , was convicted of killing @entity81 near the town of @entity83			1
he met the woman at a bar and offered to drive her home , and later admitted robbing and attempting to rape her			0
prosecutors said @entity7 dismembered @entity81 and spread her body parts around northeast @entity3 and neighboring @entity89			2
the crime was " particularly heinous , with 91 pre-mortem wounds , " according to the clemency report			0
@entity7 claimed he acted in a fit of drunken rage			2
he was involved in litigation challenging the three - drug method and received a stay of execution in 2007 because of his involvement in the suit , according to minutes of a november parole board meeting posted on the @entity103 ' web site			1
his attorney , @entity104 , had also objected to the one - drug method , saying it was unconstitutional			1
@entity104 wrote in an appeal that use of the one - drug method would amount to " human experimentation , pure and simple			1
" but the 6th @entity44 @entity111 last month denied @entity7 ' request for a stay , concluding that since @entity3 had announced it would change its protocol and rely on the one - drug method , @entity7 ' argument regarding the three - drug method was moot			1
@entity7 ' last meal was served about 7:45 p.m. monday -- pizza with extra cheese , mushrooms , onions and green peppers , along with onion rings , deep - fried mushrooms , @entity124 , french onion dip , blueberry ice cream , @entity127 and cherry pie , @entity12 said			2
during its meeting last month , members of the state parole board heard a prerecorded statement from @entity81 's mother , @entity134 , according to the meeting minutes			0
@entity134 said her health was not good but she was saving her strength to attend @entity7 ' execution			2
" since her daughter 's death , she has endured nearly 20 years of constant pain and nightmares , " the minutes said			0
" she believes that the nightmares will end with the execution			0
it makes her sick that @entity7 tortured and brutally murdered her daughter			2
" the board voted 7 - 0 to deny @entity7 clemency			2
in attempting to execute @entity38 in september , authorities tried unsuccessfully for hours to find a vein to administer his lethal injection			1
afterward , gov. @entity153 announced he would delay the executions of two other men until march at the earliest			0
@entity38 's execution has not been rescheduled			0
@entity3 has put 32 people to death in the past decade			0
@entity0 's @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
