two years after @entity0 rioted against police in a city that @entity3 made famous , @entity4 , @entity5 , has hired the first @entity0 police chief in its 157 - year history			1
@entity8 , 44 , was sworn in as chief on wednesday , overseeing a police department that is 56 % white in a city that is 53 % @entity12 -- and is still reeling from strife that grew out of police shootings of poor @entity15 , including at least one resulting in death , sparking the riots			1
@entity8 acknowledges his daunting task			0
in 2012 , two deadly police shootings in one summer weekend led to a protest outside @entity22 , just 1Â½ miles from @entity3 , the city 's famous attraction			1
that protest turned violent and spread throughout the central city for four days			0
@entity8 , who worked his way up in the department after starting as a patrolman in 1996 , will seek to regain the community 's trust through civil engagement , he said			1
@entity4 has a population of 336,000 and is also home to baseball 's @entity36 and hockey 's @entity38			1
" we have to have an open dialogue , " @entity8 said			0
" last saturday i worked with a patrol officer out in the field			0
i want them to see the police chief is out there along with the officers			1
that way the police officer sees the way the chief is working with the community , and that builds and fosters that mindset			1
" one of @entity8 's programs is called " @entity56 , " where citizens " just ask any questions they want about any topic whatsoever , " @entity8 said			2
" we then answer , and the dialogue happens and then the relationship starts to form			0
and in my opinion that has released a lot of the stress , " he said			0
he knows he has already made history in @entity4			2
" it 's very , very prideful for me for me to be able to sit in this capacity and to be the first @entity12 " police chief , he said			1
@entity8 was born and raised in @entity71 , @entity5 , which is outside the well - known @entity0 community of @entity73 and is about 17 miles northwest of @entity4			1
he was a @entity73 police officer for three years before joining the @entity4 force			2
in the past 10 years , @entity4 has had 50 shootings involving police officers , and 22 people died in those shootings , said lt. @entity79			2
that track record worries longtime community leaders such as @entity82 of a group called @entity84 , who said he hopes the police department will improve its relationship with the @entity0 community			1
" the shootings outraged our community , " @entity82 said of the 2012 violence			0
" there were demonstrations , and there is still a lot of hurt			0
" in one of the 2012 fatal shootings that led to the riots , unarmed 25 - year - old @entity101 was shot in the back , and , after he fell , police shot him in the head and killed him , the family alleged in a lawsuit			1
police acknowledged @entity101 was unarmed , but " based on the actions of @entity101 during a foot pursuit , our officer believed @entity101 was armed with a gun and posed an immediate threat , " police spokesman @entity79 said			0
" the officer fired his weapon in response to that threat			0
" in 2012 , police also described @entity101 as a gang member , but that characterization enraged the community			2
the second shooting occurred when a man in a car theft case opened fire on police , authorities said			0
officers returned fire , killing @entity128 , 21 .			0

chief @entity8 is the first @entity0 police chief in @entity4 's 157 - year history
@entity8 , 44 , worked his way up the ranks from patrolman in 1996
