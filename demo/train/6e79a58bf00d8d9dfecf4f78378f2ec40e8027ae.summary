-- president @entity1 called friday for @entity2 to fund proposals to expand public - private programs to build and repair modern ports , pipelines , schools and other infrastructure			1
at a campaign - style event in @entity10 , @entity1 said strengthening the nation 's infrastructure should be a non-partisan issue because it helps @entity16 business and creates jobs for the construction industry			1
" we ca n't afford @entity21 politics to stand in the way of @entity16 's progress , " @entity1 said , adding that " ultimately , @entity2 has to fund these projects			1
" @entity1 's proposals followed up on his call in this year 's @entity26 for such public - private partnerships to strengthen infrastructure development			1
a @entity30 aide told reporters traveling with @entity1 on @entity32 that the proposals outlined friday would cost $ 21 billion , but added that they would not add to the federal deficit			1
" their impact on the economy will be substantially greater because they will be leveraged two to one , three to one , four to one , up to seven to one depending upon the particular program , " said @entity35 , the chairman of @entity1 's @entity36			1
he added that " they will not increase the deficit by a dime because they are paid for in our budget			0
" @entity1 's budget for next year is due in coming weeks			2
@entity1 has unsuccessfully sought congressional approval throughout his presidency for a more aggressive national investment in road , rail , bridge and energy infrastructure construction to create jobs and spur economic growth			2
while some states have embraced private - public partnerships , @entity2 has been less receptive , partly because @entity58 want to offset any new spending with cuts elsewhere			2
lawmakers from both parties are also wary of losing more control over decisions on the scope and pace of infrastructure development , a key area of federal spending that they can direct to their states and districts			0
proponents of public - private partnerships argue that the nation 's aging infrastructure needs repair broadly and modernization			1
but shrinking federal , state and local budgets as well as less revenue overall from other traditional financing sources , like fuel taxes , have undercut efforts to keep pace with demand			0
the @entity86 said in a 2013 assessment that the @entity16 had a " significant backlog of overdue maintenance " across infrastructure systems and a " pressing need for modernization			2
" for instance , the group estimates it will cost $ 21 billion to bring critical , aging dams up to speed			0
it also says one in nine of the nation 's bridges are rated as structurally deficient and spending on overall maintenance and construction is roughly $ 8 billion short of what 's necessary to keep them in good shape			0
more than 40 percent of @entity16 's major urban highways remain congested , costing the economy an estimated $ 101 billion in wasted time and fuel annually , the engineering group said			1
private equity , corporations and other investors have lined up billions to spend on projects that offer a financial return over time or other benefits , such as tax breaks			0
however , the lack of federal policy or new funding commitments for such arrangements has slowed that approach			0
@entity1 favors a new bond - financing program similar to a now - expired one that was created for states and municipalities to stimulate infrastructure construction			1
he also called for creation of a federally run infrastructure bank aimed at attracting outside investment , an idea he has floated previously that @entity2 has yet to embrace			0
a @entity30 document on the plan said the proposed $ 10 billion infrastructure bank would raise as much as $ 200 billion in leveraged private investment			0
citing a @entity10 tunnel project endorsed by both the city 's chamber of commerce and labor unions , he said such agreement showed that politicians also should be able to sign on .			0
