@entity0 -- the @entity3 has modified its rules and will allow athletes to wear a full - body , tight - fitted unitard during competition , the group said			1
wednesday 's rule change was prompted by an @entity0 woman , who wanted to take part in competitions governed by @entity3 rules but still adhere to the modest dress of her @entity16 faith			1
" weightlifting is an @entity19 open for all athletes to participate without discrimination on the basis of race , color , religion , sex , age , or national origin in accordance with the principles of the @entity31 and values , " @entity17 , @entity3 president , said wednesday			1
" this rule modification has been considered in the spirit of fairness , equality and inclusion			1
" before the change , the @entity3 's technical and competition rules said weightlifting outfits -- officially called " costumes " -- had to be collarless and not cover the elbows or knees			1
@entity46 , a 35 - year - old with a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering , is not an @entity31 athlete , but enjoys lifting weights			1
she generally wears loose , long pants past the ankles , a long - sleeve , fitted shirt with a loose t - shirt over it , and a hijab , or head scarf , covering her hair			1
" it 's what i believe in			1
it 's what i 've chosen to do , " @entity46 told @entity1 this month about her decision to wear modest garb			2
" i 've always dressed this way publicly			2
" she can deadlift 245 pounds ( 111 kg ) and get up 105 pounds ( 47.5 kg ) in the snatch , in which the competitor lifts the barbell from the floor to over her head in a single motion			2
she likes to compete with other women in her weight class -- she generally weighs in the 106 - pound ( 48 kg ) or 117 - pound ( 53 kg ) classifications			1
" it guess it 's empowering , " she says			2
" there 's a lot of technique involved , so someone who 's this big muscular person -- it 's possible i could lift more than they do			2
there 's speed and timing to it -- you have to be explosive			0
i think it 's great just for confidence building ... i guess i got hooked			0
" the review was prompted by the @entity0 resident wanting to take part in tournaments in the @entity93 , including one coming up in july			0
but @entity94 informed her that those events are governed by @entity3 rules , which at that time precluded her dressing in keeping with her beliefs			1
@entity46 says she understands the need to make sure she is n't wearing anything under her clothes to give her a competitive advantage			0
she says judges could check to make sure she is not wearing something on her elbows , for example , that might help her			0
numerous athletic agencies have faced similar questions in the past and , in some cases , have determined that allowing special clothing violates fairness or equality among all contestants			0
@entity121 , the international federation governing soccer , recently refused to allow @entity123 's women 's soccer team to wear headscarves while playing in an @entity31 qualifying round in @entity126 , @entity127			0
@entity46 told @entity1 her effort is not just about herself			0
" i should at least try , " she said , " if not for me then maybe for other women who -- if they have my faith or another faith -- dress a certain way			0
" @entity1 's @entity135 contributed to this report			0

@entity138 wants to keep her body covered during official competitions
