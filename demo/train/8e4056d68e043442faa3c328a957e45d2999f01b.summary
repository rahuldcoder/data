-- this week , a mother called us about her child hospitalized with a @entity5 poisoning from his day care 's chicken lunch			2
the child 's condition was tenuous , with a blood infection , and treatment was especially challenging as the bacteria was antibiotic resistant			0
the mom turned to the @entity14 , a nonprofit consumer advocacy group , for information and help because key government 's public health agencies and websites are shut down			1
does this have an impact of food safety ? you betcha ! regardless of whether this illness is related to the outbreak linked to @entity28 chickens , it illustrates that each case of illness is important to track , and protecting our families from unsafe food should be considered an essential function of government			1
when the shutdown began , the @entity36 announced it would have to halt most of its food safety activities , including routine inspections of food manufacturers and monitoring of imports			1
the @entity44 shuttered some of its key activities , including outbreak detection and infectious - disease surveillance			2
the @entity50 @entity49 kept its meat , poultry and egg inspectors on the job , but furloughed more than 1,200 other food safety workers			1
despite the agencies ' planning , a government shutdown makes it easier for contaminated food to slip through to consumers and harder for the federal government to identify and respond to outbreaks			1
the outbreak linked to @entity28 chickenâ € ” in which hundreds of people were sickened -- was already under investigation when the furlough began			2
nonetheless , it demonstrate the shutdown 's real human impact , as consumers are left confused about why there has been no recall and whether it is safe to buy the company 's products			1
government websites that would normally give them such advice remain dark			1
there are other effects of the shutdown that may not be felt for months			0
during the first six days of the furlough , the @entity44 shut down its primary systems ( @entity86 and @entity87 ) for gathering information from the state public health agencies			1
instead , the few staff left at @entity44 gathered illness data from the states manually			0
although @entity44 recalled a number of staff from furlough to continue handling the salmonella outbreak , the agency may end up weeks behind in investigating new outbreaks as it gets its systems up and running again			1
meanwhile , key personnel at the food safety agencies that are tasked with preventing outbreaks are not at their posts , investigating suspect facilities , checking imports or analyzing lab samples			1
outbreak investigations involve a complex choreography among many state , local and federal agencies			1
they begin with state and local agencies receiving reports of illnesses , investigating them , and forwarding their findings to @entity44			0
@entity44 aggregates these state reports with data collected from monitoring programs			0
next , it sifts through huge volumes of information to link up illnesses occurring in different states , identifying common pathogens and common food sources			0
that information is forwarded to @entity49 and @entity36 , which try to track outbreaks to their sources			0
@entity49 or @entity36 may issue a public health alert or issue a recall ( or demand that a company recall potentially tainted foods ) , alerting consumers to avoid certain foods and getting them removed from supermarket shelves			0
consumers only see the final action but have little knowledge of the complexity and labor - intensive steps by multiple agencies needed to take it			0
yet 10 days ago , @entity143 sent these public health officials home and left consumers ( and the food industry ) vulnerable to the effects of dangerously contaminated foods			2
food borne disease is preventable , yet 48 million consumers suffer illnesses each year			0
usually symptoms are just an upset stomach , but more severe symptoms send 128,000 people to the hospital and kill 3,000 annually			0
those who recover may still suffer life - changing conditions , such as kidney failure , @entity164 - @entity163 © syndrome , and reactive arthritis			0
our national investments in food safety are important tools that can help reduce those numbers			1
in the best of times , investigations of outbreaks of food borne illnesses are complex and hard to solve			2
but it is truly reckless to continue this government shutdown and leave so many , like the mother and child who called this week , unprotected			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity182 *dewaal* : shutdown can have serious impact on food safety , health
she says recent salmonella outbreak from chicken shows what effect can be
she says food contamination can go *undetected* as food safety offices remain dark
*writer* : complex *cooperation* of agencies interrupted . inspectors need to get back to work
