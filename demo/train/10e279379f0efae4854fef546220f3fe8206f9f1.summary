@entity0 , @entity1 -- in 2013 , the greatest risk of conflict does n't lie in the halls of the @entity6 , on the battlefield in @entity8 nor the rising rhetoric between @entity10 and the international community , according to @entity12 of @entity13			1
" @entity17 - @entity16 is by far the most important and consequential geopolitical conflict on our screen for the entire year of 2013 , " @entity12 told @entity2 's @entity14 at the @entity15 in @entity0			1
a territorial dispute over islands in the @entity22 boiled over into often violent @entity24 demonstration in @entity17 last september has led to tensions between the world 's second and third largest economies			1
last week , new @entity16 prime minister @entity28 returned from a trip to @entity30 to shore up support of nations also at odds with @entity17 over disputed land claims in the @entity35			0
" the @entity17 do n't feel like they need the @entity16 in the way they used to -- they do n't need the technology , they do n't need the investment dollars ; and furthermore unlike places like @entity43 and the @entity44 where the @entity17 have a large @entity46 population that really controls the local business so over time the @entity17 feel they win no matter what ; in @entity16 ... there 's no influence there , " @entity12 said			2
@entity0 2013 : new year , same old problems ? after opening to economic reforms in 1979 , the economy of the world 's most populated country sprinted ahead at an average of 10 % growth each year , overtaking @entity16 as the world 's second largest economy in late 2010			2
while @entity17 is still in many ways a developing nation -- it 's gdp per capita was 94th in the world in 2011 -- most economists expect it will jump ahead of the @entity65 as the world 's largest economy by 2030			2
the december report by the @entity65 @entity68 , " @entity69 : alternative worlds , " forecast that @entity65 economic and international influence will decline in the next two decades as a shift of global power moves from the @entity74 to the @entity22 -- with the rise of @entity17 as one of the greatest forces quest : @entity65 economy to dominate @entity0 2013 " @entity17 is slated to pass the threshold of us $ 15,000 per capita purchasing power parity ( @entity84 ) in the next five years or soâ € ” a level that is often a trigger for democratization , " the report notes			1
" @entity17 ` soft ' power could be dramatically boosted , setting off a wave of democratic movements			0
alternatively , many experts believe a democratic @entity17 could also become more nationalistic			0
an economically collapsed @entity17 would trigger political unrest and shock the global economy			0
" @entity12 thinks the odds of that are long , but a @entity17 moving on its current path will still be a primary player of world events in the next two decades			0
@entity98 's decade : a tale of boom and bust " of course the rise of @entity17 has enormous implications for both economic conflict and political conflict precisely because this is a poor country , it 's an authoritarian country , it 's a state capitalist country -- and by the time @entity17 becomes the world 's largest economy , surpassing the @entity65 , those fundamental qualities of @entity17 will not particularly change , " he said			1
" here you have a situation for many decades where @entity65 felt that @entity17 's rise was in their interest -- already @entity16 understands that @entity17 's rise is not in its interest , it 's a bad thing , " @entity12 said			1
" increasingly the @entity65 is very , very conflicted			0

@entity12 : @entity17 - @entity16 conflict poses the greatest geopolitical conflict in 2013
a dispute over a group of islands in the @entity22 has strained *relations*
@entity17 's growing power has led to a *reevaluation* in @entity127 ; made @entity65 wary
