-- as " @entity3 " star @entity2 returns from his brief " hiatus , " he 'll do so to the cheers of some surprising supporters â € ” southern blacks			1
@entity2 was suspended from the @entity9 hit show for calling homosexuality a sin and equating it to bestiality in a @entity14 profile			1
receiving less attention were his comments that black people were happier before the civil rights movement			2
media have focused on two camps in the controversy			2
on one side are @entity2 's predictable supporters , who include white evangelicals , southern @entity26 politicians and @entity27			1
on the opposing team are @entity30 activists and progressives			0
but while @entity2 's comments have roiled members of @entity35 's black media elite such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , @entity2 has found pockets of support among church - going , middle - class @entity41			1
though i grew up in @entity45 , @entity46 , a city a little over an hour 's drive from the @entity2 's empire in @entity49 , i 've spent my adult life in @entity51			1
so when a high school @entity53 friend posted a 10 - paragraph open letter of support to @entity9 for @entity2 , which was signed " everyone who is n't a left wing extremist ( @entity59 your former customer base ) , " i was a bit surprised			1
in my view , @entity2 's comments regarding both homosexuals and @entity41 suggest he lacks empathy and the ability to think critically			1
to be preoccupied with the " sin " of 3 percent to 6 percent of the population seems as off - base as the idea that a people could be happy with second - class citizenship			2
my @entity53 friend never confirmed penning the letter he posted , which received nearly 50 " likes " from other college - educated black professionals and blue - collar types			0
the comments ranged from analogies , " where would we be if @entity80 had went to the back of the bus			2
she had rights , he has rights , " to concern , " have you noticed that anything and everything can be said about @entity91 now			0
our beliefs are now wrong and we are outdated			0
" when two commenters pointed out @entity2 's misguided remarks about black people " singing " while working the fields , they were quickly rebuffed with , " from what i heard him say what he @entity100			1
are you saying that there are n't blacks who were n't like he said			0
" because support for @entity2 seemed to be fueled by religious beliefs , i sought some insight from bishop @entity109 , pastor of @entity110 in @entity45			1
the bishop explained that though he was " deeply concerned " with how @entity2 expressed his spiritual views on homosexuality , he added , " i ca n't twist scripture to suit a lifestyle ... i speak the truth in love			1
" indeed , @entity109 's position is held most strongly by the black church			2
a 2013 @entity124 poll found that while the percentage of white evangelicals , mainliners and @entity128 who believe homosexual behavior is a sin has dropped 4 , 5 , and 14 percentage points , respectively , since a similar poll was conducted in 2003 , the percentage of black @entity120 who regard homosexual behavior as a sin has actually increased 5 points to 79 %			2
many disagree with @entity2 's portrayal of @entity136 - era @entity41			1
@entity109 said : " while i believe @entity2 has freedom of speech , i respectfully disagree with his remarks regarding black people			1
in my humble opinion , while our community has a history of overcoming adversity , making lemons out of lemonade regardless of the difficulty of the situation , one should not mistake our ability to endure with our actually enjoying abuse			0
" @entity153 : " @entity3 " star 's rights were n't violated not all of @entity2 's black support is due to religious convictions			1
black hunters share a pastime with the @entity2 clan			1
while home for @entity161 , an uncle who loves " @entity3 " shared his perspective with me on camera			1
uncle @entity166 is 53 and has been a hunter all of his adult life			0
he owns a home , attends church and votes in every election			0
he honed his hunting skills watching tv outdoorsmen like @entity175 and @entity176			0
for him , " @entity3 " is an extension of the hunting show genre he loves			1
@entity181 explained @entity2 's comments this way : " the way ( @entity2 ) talks , it 's old talk ... the new generation is a whole lot different			1
everything is out in the open ... the comment ( @entity2 ) made ( about homosexuality ) probably was taught to him at a young age , but i do believe he just made a mistake			1
he apologized , so i 'm gon na continue to watch the show if it keeps coming on			2
" @entity195 : do n't reject " @entity3 " family while my uncle was unfazed by @entity2 's comments about black people , some family members were put off			1
as a child in the late ' 70s , i had occasion to scale perch , pick bushels of purple - hull peas and use an outhouse			0
i 've heard kin describe what it 's like to pick cotton ( hot and painful ) , and they never sounded happy about it , but another story told in my family might explain the " happy " put - on			2
annually , my grandmother recounts my @entity217 birth , explaining that because the hospital was understaffed and did n't execute his birth certificate until the next day , his birth date is listed as december 26			0
as in past years , someone asked my grandmother why she did n't point out the mistake			0
her eyes grew wide , and she shook her head violently			0
" no ! you do n't understand , " she tells us			2
" i was at @entity228 ! those white doctors did n't talk to us , and we did n't question them			0
" while my grandmother was in labor , her mother and aunt would wait in a closet - size room reserved for @entity235			0
once a black child was born , a nurse would enter the room with her back to its occupants and write on a chalkboard the mother 's name , the baby 's sex and weight , and whether the baby was dead or alive			2
with a frown , my grandmother added , " the only thing they ever said to me was , ' @entity251 , what you gon ' name this baby ? ' " that my grandmother would not point out such a mistake is unfathomable to her grandchildren and great - grandchildren			0
we only know of her strength			0
to us she is the lifelong domestic who birthed nine healthy babies , buried two grown sons and slept in the bed her husband had died in hours earlier			0
but in her eyes , when she tells this story , i can see her vulnerability , her fear that " they 'd send me home and not let me come back			0
" @entity270 , a researcher and storyteller who focuses on the @entity273 era , is not surprised that black workers shielded their true feelings from @entity2			1
" this was the age of black lynchings			0
a black person would never have reveled their true self to a white person who looked and talked like @entity2 , " @entity270 said before referencing the @entity279 poem that opens with this stanza : we wear the mask that grins and lies , it hides our cheeks and shades our eyes , â € ” this debt we pay to human guile ; with torn and bleeding hearts we smile , and mouth with myriad subtleties			1
since my visit home , i 've thought a lot about @entity109 's last comments regarding what he believed to be @entity2 's greatest offense â € ” saying that homosexuals " wo n't inherit the kingdom of @entity302			1
" the bishop emphasized : " only the @entity305 has the right to condemn one to hell or lift them to heaven			0
" clearly , the big guy has his work cut out for him			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity314 .			2

" @entity3 " star @entity2 returns in new *episodes* after controversial comments
@entity314 disagrees with him but says there are pockets of support for show among @entity41
she says some believe homosexuality is a sin ; hunters feel an *affinity* for show
@entity332 : some of my relatives understand , but *object* to , @entity2 's comments on race
