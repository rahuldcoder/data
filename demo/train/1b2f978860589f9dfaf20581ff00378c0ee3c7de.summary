@entity0 , @entity1 -- lawmakers in @entity1 passed a law on sunday banning senior @entity6 government officials from holding official posts			1
the move comes after a week of rising tensions in the @entity11 capital of @entity0 as heavily armed protesters surrounded the foreign and justice ministries demanding that the legislature pass the law			1
the political isolation law could exclude current senior officials such as the head of the @entity19 , who served as ambassador to @entity22 in the 1970s before he joined the exiled opposition to the @entity6 government			1
the @entity19 is @entity1 's parliament			2
it remains unclear if prime minister @entity25 , who was a diplomat in @entity22 around the same time , would be affected by the ban			1
the law , which would be implemented by a committee that would decide whether officials fall under the exclusion criteria , goes into effect in 30 days			0
but the law has already come under fire by international watchdog groups			0
" ( the law ) violates human rights and @entity1 's provisional constitution because it allows for guilt by association rather than provable misdeeds			1
the provisions and procedures for exclusion are overly broad and vague			0
the desire to ban corrupt and abusive officials is understandable , but this law is deeply flawed , " said @entity44 , @entity45 's @entity1 researcher			1
soon after the law was passed , @entity11 broke into cheers as hundreds congregated outside the @entity19 , celebrating what many described as a victory			0
celebratory gunfire rang across many areas of @entity0 as people drove around the city honking their horns and chanting in celebration			0
outside the @entity61 , armed protesters played music and danced as they prepared to sacrifice a camel , a @entity11 tradition			2
in march armed protesters surrounded the @entity19 for several hours in an attempt to force lawmakers to pass the law			1
they later opened fire on the car of @entity70 , who escaped unharmed			0
there were concerns on sunday of a repeat of these events if lawmakers had not come to an agreement			0
the siege of government ministries seems to have ended with the passing of the law , but many @entity11 are concerned about the implications of the vote			0
" the events of last week have set a number of precedents -- the precedent that using arms to force the government to adopt a law or policy ; the precedent of establishing non-equality of citizenship before the law , in effect creating classes of @entity11 ; and the principle that in the @entity1 , people can and will be judged on the bases of general classification , not individual responsibility , " said @entity90 , a former @entity6 opposition figure and a @entity1 analyst .			2

former @entity6 officials are now banned from official posts in @entity1
armed protesters had *pressed* lawmakers to pass the law for *months*
head of parliament , prime minister may be affected by the law
law is " guilt by association " and unfair , @entity45 says
