the next week , she had three offers and her home was sold			1
" i could n't believe it			2
i do n't know what it is about it			2
it 's some sort of a miracle , " says @entity9			2
this " miracle " has it roots in @entity35			2
according to the tradition , burying @entity8 began hundreds of years ago in @entity38			1
@entity39 , a nun in the 16th century , buried a medal of the saint and prayed to @entity8 to help secure land for a convent			1
the ritual is said to have worked , and so the trend of burying @entity8 has caught on			1
just ask @entity47 of @entity48 , @entity49			0
his online retail site , @entity51 , offers the " underground real estate agent " home - selling kits			1
for $ 9.95 , the 4 - inch statue comes with a burial bag and a burial instruction booklet			0
there 's even an 8 - inch version of the statue for larger homes			0
sales have increased 100 percent in the past two years , according to @entity47			2
@entity62 , who runs @entity63 -- a catholic supply company on @entity65 , says sales of the @entity67 spiked last year			2
and he expects the trend to last			0
" we 're probably going to sell over 100,000 this year , " he says			2
the biggest demand is coming from the @entity71 and the @entity72 , he says			0
@entity73 , the store manager at a @entity35 retail supply store in @entity75 , @entity76 , says the statues have been one of the better sellers , with sales increasing 25 percent this year			1
" people seem more panicked and there is a hurried - ness to their expression when they come in , " she says			0
@entity8 is even on the auction block			1
there are dozens of @entity8 home - selling kits on @entity87			1
from glow in the dark @entity8 statues to mini pocket shrines , @entity8 has a whole new following			1
burying @entity8 statues has its own set of rules , too , although they can vary			1
home sellers are instructed to dig a hole near the " @entity99 " sign			1
the hole should be three inches taller than the statue itself			0
the saint should then be facing the direction of the street			0
then prayers to @entity8 should be said before the saint is covered with dirt			1
once the house is sold , @entity8 should be dug up and put in a place of honor in the new home			1
some renters have even cashed in on @entity8 's divine intervention in hopes of getting a break on rent or to have their application accepted			1
they buried @entity8 statues in flowerpots			1
the statue 's feet should either be facing the street or in the direction you want to move , according to @entity47			0
the whole statue - burying process was a bit hard to swallow for @entity127			2
his @entity129 , @entity130 , home was on the market earlier this month			2
@entity127 first heard about the ritual from his godfather			0
" i looked on the @entity134			0
it was less than $ 10			0
so , i said why not ? " recalls @entity127			0
six hours later a young woman walked into the house and made a bid			0
" i 'm not very religious , " says @entity127			0
" but that was pretty amazing			0
" @entity8 may have made a believer out of some sellers , but for some real estate agents , selling a home is n't the work of a higher power			1
" what a crock ! " says @entity147 real estate agent @entity146			0
" as a realtor i think it 's ridiculous			0
the business has always been simple			0
if a house is properly priced and properly exposed , it 'll attract buyers and it will sell -- @entity8 or no @entity155			1
" @entity47 says the statue is more than just superstition			0
" it 's the idea of getting beyond yourself			0
it 's about hoping and praying for something that is bigger than you are , " he says			0
and these days , maybe just a little hope for home sellers is n't such a bad thing			1

with home sales falling , some sellers seek divine intervention
tradition says burying @entity8 statues will help sell houses
