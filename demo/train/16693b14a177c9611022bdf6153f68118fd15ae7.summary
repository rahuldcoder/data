@entity0 -- a cold case involving the poisoning of a college sophomore in @entity0 almost two decades ago has captured the imagination of @entity7 communities around the world , landing a petition on the @entity11 website and igniting an emotional debate on the pursuit of justice in @entity7			1
@entity15 was a chemistry major at the prestigious @entity17 , often called " @entity7 's @entity18 , " when she started experiencing stomach pain , hair loss and other inexplicable symptoms in late 1994 , state - run news agency @entity19 reported in a story published in april			1
doctors eventually diagnosed her with poisoning by thallium , a highly toxic chemical used in rodent and insect poisons			0
police investigated one of @entity15 's roommates , @entity33 , but subsequently cleared her as a suspect , @entity19 said			1
the authorities have so far remained quiet on the case			2
although domestic @entity7 media had covered the unsolved mystery in the past , news of a fatal poisoning case at a @entity44 college dorm in april rekindled national -- and even global -- interest in @entity15 's story			1
in the @entity44 case , police quickly identified the victim 's roommate as the suspect and arrested him for alleged murder			1
as events unfolded in @entity44 , @entity7 reporters and internet users increasingly looked back at the @entity15 case and highlighted her plight			1
now almost 40 years old , @entity15 remains mostly bed - ridden and appears overweight in recent photos			1
once an accomplished musician and avid swimmer , she is practically blind and has the mental capacity of a 6 - year - old child			1
was investigation botched ? amid new outpourings of sympathy , speculation on the investigation abounds across @entity7 cyberspace			0
on @entity71 , @entity7 's equivalent of @entity72 with more than 300 million users , many posts alleged a botched process complete with vanishing crucial evidence and mounting political pressure due to the @entity79 family 's powerful connections			2
@entity79 's grandfather was a high - ranking official in the @entity82 government before the @entity84 takeover in 1949			2
he later held senior -- though largely symbolic -- positions in the @entity86 until his death in 1995			0
another close relative , a cousin of @entity79 's father , was considered a national leader from 1993 to 2003 when he was a vice-chairman of @entity7 's top political advisory body			0
@entity79 has reportedly made three online statements on @entity94 , a popular @entity7 internet discussion forum , according to state media			0
@entity1 's efforts to reach @entity79 and her family tuesday were unsuccessful			0
in 2005 , @entity79 stated that police took her in for questioning in april 1997 because of her access to thallium			0
she said police cleared her as a suspect in august 1998 due to lack of evidence			1
@entity79 added that she was not the only student with access to the toxic substance and denied personal animosity between herself and @entity15			2
addressing her family 's political connections , she said her grandfather had died by the time she was questioned			0
in 2006 , @entity79 said her family had submitted an application to the police on her behalf requesting the authorities re-open the investigation to " find the truth			0
" in april , after the @entity44 poisoning reignited public interest in @entity15 's case , @entity79 resurfaced on @entity94 and wrote : " i , more than anyone else , would like to bring the real perpetrator to justice			1
" online campaign for ' justice ' last friday , with discussion on the @entity15 case reaching fever pitch , @entity71 started censoring the topic by blocking keywords like " @entity15 " and " thallium			1
" the site 's action only added fuel to the fire over the continued official silence , especially about whether @entity79 had any role in the crime			0
on the same day , a " @entity151 " from @entity152 created a petition on the @entity11 's official website , naming @entity79 -- whose @entity144 name is @entity146 -- as the prime suspect in the poisoning case and accusing her of committing marriage fraud to enter the @entity150			1
the petition calls for the @entity150 government to investigate and deport her " to protect the safety of our citizens			1
" in less than four days , more than 130,000 people had signed the petition			0
anyone can petition the @entity150 federal government online to take action on an issue			1
according to terms posted on the @entity11 website , a petition must reach 100,000 signatures within 30 days to require a response			1
" it 's extraordinary to seek another country 's help to address a domestic judicial issue , " @entity169 , a @entity0 - based political commentator , told @entity1			0
" but if your own government ignores you , i think it 's reasonable to see people feel compelled to seek outside pressure to ensure judicial fairness and transparency in their own country			0
" other observers oppose what they view as a cyber witch - hunt for @entity79 " the law is about evidence -- you ca n't convict someone without evidence and not everything is a conspiracy , " a @entity150 - based user wrote on his @entity71 page			1
" petitioning the @entity11 without evidence is the ultimate fail -- those people really do n't understand the law or @entity150 politics			1
" @entity15 's mother speaks out @entity71 has lifted its short - lived ban on the discussion of the @entity15 case , as her 72 - year - old mother was interviewed by a talk show host on @entity204 on monday recounting her experience of being stonewalled by the police over the years , @entity205 said the government has rejected the family 's request to make the investigation results public			1
" i will continue to apply , " she said			0
" i hope to have an answer			0
i hope to give @entity15 an answer			2
" " @entity15 is my child and she is a good child , " she added			2
" in the prime of her youth , she almost lost her life and she 's been miserable since			0
" such heart - wrenching words have resonated with the public , prompting many of the so - called " @entity71 stars " with millions of followers to retweet @entity15 's story and appeal for help			1
websites set up by @entity15 's supporters home and abroad are attracting new donations for her parents , whose entire lives now focus on caring for their ailing daughter			2
will public attention bring action ? even the official @entity19 news agency has jumped into the fray , mentioning @entity79 's " unusual family background " and challenging the police to speak up about the case with concrete evidence in a widely circulated article published monday			2
" whether or not to re-open the investigation depends on new evidence , but the @entity0 police should take a meaningful step forward by breaking their silence , " opined the @entity246 newspaper on its official @entity247			0
" doing so would help not only the victim but also the alleged suspect as well as the police 's own credibility			0
" " in the past few years , people have seen too much injustice in stories posted online -- and the political power 's wanton interference in the judicial system , " said @entity169 , the commentator			0
" things just erupted when @entity15 's case resurfaced			1
" for @entity15 's parents , however , the latest wave of public attention changes little for their daughter			2
" i used to hope for a miracle , " @entity15 's mother said on the radio show			2
" now that it 's been so long , i just hope to see her conditions improve			0
