-- @entity2 holders @entity1 survived a scare in @entity4 on tuesday evening as @entity6 's second - half equalizer earned them a 1 - 1 last 16 first leg draw against @entity8			1
the @entity10 giants failed to produce the free - flowing football that has become their trademark under coach @entity13 and they fell behind in the 25th minute			0
@entity8 had warmed up for the match by hitting five goals past @entity17 at the weekend , with striker @entity18 helping himself to four of them			1
and the @entity20 - born forward maintained that form by opening the scoring here , powerfully heading home @entity25 's cross			0
the home side had chances to double their lead before the break , with only goalkeeper @entity30 depriving @entity18 of a second -- although @entity31 did strike the post with a long - range effort for the visitors			2
however , @entity1 regrouped after the break and levelled just seven minutes into the second period , when @entity37 striker @entity6 was on hand to finish from @entity40 's nod down			2
the result means @entity1 will be strong favorites to reach the quarterfinals when the teams meet again at the @entity45 in a fortnight 's time			0
meanwhile , in the night 's other match , @entity48 look well set to reach the quarterfinals after a narrow 1 - 0 victory against @entity52 in @entity53			1
@entity55 's side are unbeaten in the competition this season and look genuine contenders to win the trophy after @entity60 nodded home @entity63 's free - kick from close range on the stroke of half time			0
in the only @entity69 match played in tuesday , @entity67 giants @entity66 cruised into the last 16 after thrashing @entity70 4 - 0 for a 5 - 1 aggregate victory			1
two goals from oscar @entity73 and one apiece from @entity74 and @entity75 ensured @entity66 's smooth progress , where they will now face either @entity77 or @entity78 .			0

@entity1 fight back to earn a 1 - 1 @entity2 draw in @entity8
@entity6 levels for the holders after @entity18 put the @entity85 side ahead
