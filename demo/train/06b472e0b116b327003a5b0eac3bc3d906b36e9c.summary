-- more state restrictions on fishing in the @entity3 were lifted monday as the fall shrimping season began , but efforts to permanently plug the ruptured @entity7 oil well were delayed again			1
the worst oil spill in @entity10 history has hobbled fishermen across the @entity3 as federal and state authorities put much of its waters off - limits due to safety concerns			2
with the well capped on a temporary basis for a month , the @entity16 and the @entity17 have begun lifting those restrictions -- but @entity21 shrimpers like @entity22 say more needs to be done , and soon			0
" it 's open down over here with small shrimp , where it should be open over there where the big shrimp are , " @entity22 told @entity0			2
" ca n't make no money with no little shrimp , man			1
" @entity22 said he planned to go out , because " i ai n't made nothing since the @entity7 spill			1
" but he was concerned that inspectors might find signs of oil in his catch and make him dump it			2
" so why go out there and catch it if they 're just going to be dumped , and i ai n't going to make no money off it ? " he asked			1
" i 've got to make money			1
i 've got four grandkids i 'm raising , man			0
" @entity48 , a spokeswoman for the @entity49 , said it will likely take days to assess what impact the spill has had on the @entity3 catch			0
and while some shrimpers are eager to get back out , many are still working for the well 's owner , @entity7 , which has hired many boats to skim oil off the surface and lay protective booms along the shorelines			1
and concerns about the long - term impact of the spill persisted with a new report from researchers at the @entity68 , who reported that oil from the @entity72 spill may have settled to the bottom of the @entity3 further east than previously suspected -- and at levels toxic to marine life			1
initial findings from a new survey of the @entity3 conclude that dispersants may have sent droplets of crude to the ocean floor , where it has turned up at the bottom of an undersea canyon within 40 miles of the @entity85			2
the results are scheduled to be released tuesday , but @entity0 obtained a summary of the initial conclusions monday night			0
plankton and other organisms at the base of the food chain showed a " strong toxic response " to the crude , and the oil could well up onto the continental shelf and resurface later , according to researchers			0
" the dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters , where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life , " said @entity98 , a marine microbiologist at @entity68			0
the spill erupted april 20 with an explosion that sank the offshore drilling platform @entity72			0
the blast killed 11 men and uncapped an undersea gusher that spewed an estimated 205 million gallons of oil into the @entity3 before it was temporarily shut in july 15			2
@entity113 , the federal government 's point man in the @entity3 , said monday that attempts to permanently seal the well wo n't start until the latest potential problem is evaluated			0
@entity113 said engineers are now concerned about how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus , a ring that surrounds the casing pipe at the center of the well shaft			0
the " timelines wo n't be known until we get a recommendation on the course of action , " @entity113 said			0
scientists began new pressure tests last week to gauge the effects of the mud and cement poured into the well from above during the " static kill " procedure that started august 3			1
from those pressure readings , they believe that either some of the cement breached the casing pipe and leaked into the annulus , or cement came up into the annulus from the bottom			2
the scientists believe that process may have trapped some oil between the cement and the top of the well , inside the annulus			2
now , given that new variable , they 're trying to figure out how to safely maintain the pressure within the well before launching the " bottom kill , " a procedure aimed at sealing the well from below			1
@entity113 told reporters that when it comes to giving a green light to the " bottom kill " of the well through the nearby relief well , " nobody wants to make that declaration any more than i do			1
" but the process " will not start until we figure out how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus			0
" " we 're using an overabundance of caution , " he said			0
@entity113 said crews could remove the capping stack that sealed the oil in the well on july 15 , then replace the well 's blowout preventer with a new one stored on the nearby @entity174 in the @entity3			0
@entity113 said a new blowout preventer would be " rated at much higher pressure levels than the annulus			0
" the other option would require @entity7 to devise a pressure - relief device for the current capping stack			1
once crews get their marching orders , it will take them about 96 hours to prepare , drill the final 50 feet of a relief well and intercept the main well			0
then , the bottom kill process of plugging the well from below would begin			1
@entity7 acknowledged monday that the disruption the oil spill has caused to lives across the @entity17 has built up tension among residents			1
in response , the company announced monday it is providing a total of $ 52 million to five behavioral health support and outreach programs			1
@entity7 released a statement saying it would give the federal @entity197 $ 10 million ; the @entity198 , $ 3 million ; the @entity199 , $ 15 million ; and the departments of mental health in @entity202 and @entity203 , $ 12 million each			1
" we appreciate that there is a great deal of stress and anxiety across the region , and as part of our determination to make things right for the people of the region , we are providing this assistance now to help make sure individuals who need help know where to turn , " said @entity7 , president of @entity7 and incoming leader of @entity7 's @entity206			2
@entity0 's @entity226 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0

@entity231 : " ca n't make no money with no little shrimp "
new : oil traces said to spread east on sea floor
no timeline set for bottom kill as scientists study well pressure
@entity7 *pledges* $ 52 million to behavioral health support
