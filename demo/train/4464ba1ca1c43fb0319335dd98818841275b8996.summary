-- it 's just days till @entity2 , and many young girls around the world will be thrilled to find little dolls under the tree to play with			1
but there 's new evidence that it 's not only human girls who enjoy playing with imaginary babies -- young apes may be showing the same behavior			2
a research paper published tuesday has found what its authors say is the first - ever evidence that young female chimpanzees in the wild " play " with sticks as if they are dolls			1
" we find that juveniles tend to carry sticks in a manner suggestive of rudimentary doll play , " they write in the current issue of @entity22			1
" and , as in children and captive monkeys , this behavior is more common in females than in males			1
" the team of researchers watched and logged the @entity34 group of chimpanzees in the @entity36 in @entity37 for more than a decade			1
they were surprised to see young female chimpanzees carrying around sticks , apparently mimicking the way that mothers in the group cared for their own infants			2
the behavior would go on for up to hours at a time			0
" the juveniles carried pieces of bark , small logs or woody vine , with their hand or mouth , underarm or , most commonly , tucked between the abdomen and thigh , " they wrote			0
" individuals carried sticks for periods of one minute to more than four hours during which they rested , walked , climbed , slept and fed as usual			1
" co-authors @entity60 of @entity61 and @entity62 of @entity63 found that such behavior was witnessed only rarely among young male chimpanzees , pointing to the controversial idea that differences in play behavior even in other primate species may be gender - driven			1
boy chimpanzees typically used sticks as weapons , shaking them to intimidate playmates			1
but just like human boys with " action figures , " young male chimpanzees were sometimes seen playing with dolls as well			0
@entity60 described one 4 - year - old male named @entity77 in an e-mail response : " he was observed to bring his stick into his nest and play the ' airplane game ' with it , that is , he laid on his back with his arms and legs extended upward and balanced the stick on his upturned palms and ' flew ' it from side to side			2
this behavior is performed by mother chimpanzees with their infants and , of course , human parents do it as well			0
another interesting observation is that @entity77 even constructed a separate nest for his stick			0
" it could be some combination of nature and nurture , as monkeys and apes have been observed playing with toys and dolls in captivity before , with previous studies showing an affinity for females to take on mothering role - play			1
" sex differences in juvenile stick - carrying did not result from females observing their mothers carrying sticks , since mothers never carried sticks , " the study found			1
" instead , youngsters apparently learned socially from each other			0
such juvenile traditions have previously been described only in humans			0
" so should this behavior in any way alter the way we perceive chimpanzees , and any affiliation with human behaviors ? " regarding how this study is related to the sex difference that we see in how human children play , it has at the very least contributed to the discussion of the factors underlying these differences , " @entity60 answered			0
" our results suggest that part of the explanation may lie in innate differences between males and females			0
specifically , there may be differences in how the sexes play that shape how they interact with toys , including which types they prefer			0
" that finding would suggest there may be a genetic and gender - driven force behind the play			0
the behavior seemed to be a practice exercise for how to care for babies , with the chimpanzees often seen taking the sticks back to their nests and playing with them in the same way mothers did with real offspring			2
the authors say that the doll play may have evolved to help the animals learn how to be better mothers and caretakers .			2

report in @entity22 : behavior is more common in females than in males
young chimps carried sticks in a manner similar to mothers caring for their young
boy chimps typically used sticks as weapons , but sometimes showed doll - play behavior
research paper was based on more than a decade observing chimps in @entity37
