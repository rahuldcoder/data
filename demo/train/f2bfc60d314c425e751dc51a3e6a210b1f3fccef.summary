a senior @entity1 staffer is resigning after her comments that the @entity8 daughters should " try showing a little class " caused a firestorm of criticism on social media this weekend			1
@entity9 , communications director for @entity11 rep. @entity10 , confirmed to @entity12 that she planned to resign monday			1
she faced heavy backlash when she wrote a @entity15 screed against the @entity8 daughters , as well as the president and first lady , on @entity18 that quickly went viral across the web			1
in it , she scolded @entity21 and @entity8 , 16 and 13 years old , respectively , for what she said was their inappropriate outfits and their bored looks during wednesday 's turkey pardoning ceremony , which they attended alongside their father			1
" @entity28 and @entity21 : i get you 're both in those awful teen years , but you 're a part of the @entity31 , try showing a little class			2
at least respect the part you play , " @entity9 wrote in the post			1
" then again , your mother and father do n't respect their positions very much , or the nation for that matter , " she added			0
" so i 'm guessing you 're coming up a little short in the ' good role model ' department			0
" @entity9 went on to tell them to " stretch yourself ... rise to the occasion " and " act like being in the @entity47 matters to you			2
" " dress like you deserve respect , not a spot at a bar			0
and certainly do n't make faces during televised , public events , " she concluded			0
hours later , after her comments picked up steam on social media , @entity9 deleted it and wrote another post apologizing for her comments			1
@entity47 press secretary @entity59 said during his briefing with reporters on monday that while he was " taken aback " by her comments , he thought her apology was " appropriate			2
" " i was taken aback there was a political operative on @entity65 who did use the occastion of a @entity15 - themed event to criticize members of the @entity31 , " @entity59 said			0
" i was a bit surprised by that			0
but i will say that she has posted an apology to her website , and i think that was an appropriate thing to do			0
" neither @entity10 nor his chief of staff , @entity75 , responded to requests for comment via email			2
but @entity9 found few defenders this weekend , even drawing a rebuke from @entity82 communications director @entity81 via @entity83 on monday morning			1
" children , especially the first daughters , are off limits , " he tweeted			0
@entity81 was far more displeased , however , with the way the comments were covered by the media than he was with the comments themselves			2
" while the comments were inappropriate and insensitive , the mainstream media 's coverage of this story is appalling			1
in over 20 years in politics i have never seen 1 of the countless inappropriate comments by @entity98 ever covered to a faction of this , " @entity81 added .			0

@entity9 , communications director for @entity11 rep. @entity10 , resigned monday
her criticism of the @entity8 daughters as *lacking* " class " in a @entity18 post went viral
the @entity82 's communications director said while her comments were wrong , the media coverage of them was *worse*
