-- sunday night brought @entity1 for @entity2 of " @entity3			1
" the first of the final eight episodes featured an unbelievably tense scene , one that left fans with two words of wisdom as they barrel toward the conclusion			1
they were uttered by @entity14 's corrupt meth kingpin after his brother - in - law , @entity16 agent @entity15 , tells him he does n't even know who @entity17 is anymore			2
@entity17 's advice ? in that case , " tread lightly			2
" ( @entity22 's advice on @entity23 was n't half - bad either : " if you did n't see breaking bad tonight , tomorrow you better take your spoilers like a man			2
" ) keeping that in mind , we 'll tread lightly on revealing too much in case you 're still catching up or somehow nodded off during the mid-season premiere			1
the expectations were intimidatingly high for sunday 's " @entity33 , " but in the eyes of critics , creator @entity34 and his team delivered -- as did stars @entity14 and @entity39			1
the journey kicks off with another flash - forward , showing the @entity2 home in disarray , its pool drained of its contents with a yellow " @entity47 " tagged on a wall			2
we watched @entity17 grab the ricin capsule from behind an electrical socket , and then we 're back in the present again			2
and that 's when the real fun begins			2
we knew that @entity15 suspected that @entity17 was the meth kingpin he 's been chasing , but we did n't know how he 'd put those pieces together			0
sunday 's episode wasted no time answering one of our big questions , and by the end of it , @entity15 and @entity17 were stunningly face - to - face			1
it was at this point that we sort of wished @entity63 would go the @entity65 route and just give the episodes to us all at once , and we 're not the only ones			1
" this tv version of a literary thriller has reached the point where the pieces are finally coming together and all we want to do is whip through its pages and finally devour that much - craved resolution			0
but we ca n't , because there are seven more episodes to go , " said @entity75 's @entity74			1
" there 's a lesson in it ... after watching a show about a man who comes to think he can have everything his way , whenever he wants , it 's good to be reminded that most people ca n't			0
we are not in control , so we must accept it , respect it and patiently savor the prolonged , delicious agony			0
" the @entity92 found the climactic scene to be " a classic opener for the season : a cowboy showdown that placed @entity15 , once a minor , comic character on the show , dead center in the role of hero			1
" and yet , the magazine 's @entity107 predicts , " based on that terrifying cold open , it 's a solid bet that @entity15 is a red herring , and the show 's real endgame will be @entity106 , the one most damaged by @entity17			0
" @entity111 's @entity110 agrees , believing that there 's no way @entity17 is making it out of this series alive -- flash - forwards to his 52nd birthday with a head full of hair , be damned -- and that @entity106 is going to be the one to do it			0
" like all good psychopaths , @entity2 has convinced himself that his prior crimes do n't matter as long as he lives decently in the future , " @entity110 writes			0
" but @entity106 ca n't forget what they 've done			0
@entity106 has grown a conscience , and it 's killing him			0
and if @entity106 is to find any kind of peace for the rest of his life -- even in prison -- he 's going to have to destroy the monster he knows better than anyone else			0
" with just seven more episodes to go , we 'll find out soon enough			1
judging from the premiere , though , the rest of the season is bound to be just as fantastic as whatever end we find			1
as @entity143 's @entity142 put it , " @entity141 ' on			0
