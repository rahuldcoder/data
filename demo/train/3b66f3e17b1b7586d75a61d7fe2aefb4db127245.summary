-- a 24 - year - old who was stabbed to death in @entity4 is the victim of " corrective rape , " gay rights activists said thursday , a crime where men attack lesbians in an attempt to reverse their sexual orientation			1
@entity11 was attacked late last month after dropping off her girlfriend in @entity13 near @entity14			1
she was raped , stabbed with broken glass several times and her face pummelled with rocks , @entity15 said			1
" a beer bottle , a large rock and used condoms were found on and near her body , " the rights group said			1
earlier this week , the nation 's @entity26 set up a task force to address hate crimes against lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender @entity4			1
the task team was set up after activists worldwide signed an online petition demanding the @entity4 government act to halt the attacks			1
the call to petition intensified after @entity11 's killing			2
police in @entity42 province , where the township is located , said they have not found any evidence of a hate crime and an investigation is under way			1
but some gay rights activists disagree			2
" her attack is a case of corrective rape , " said gay rights activist @entity49			2
" neighbors said they heard her attackers telling her , ' we will take the lesbian out of you			2
' they were mocking her and asking her why she acts like a man			0
" @entity49 is a community networking organizer for @entity61 , where @entity11 worked as well			0
the death has sparked renewed calls for action as rights groups warn of escalated homophobic attacks			0
" in these cases , killing is the end of the spectrum , " said @entity67 , the @entity4 director for @entity15			1
" it follows a trail of other problems -- rape , violence , problem accessing health care and violation by police			0
" @entity67 said it is hard to get an overall number of the people subjected to violence because attacks go unreported over the distrust for the judicial system			0
" there 's a great deal of under - representation because they are going to face secondary victimization , " she said			0
" we 've heard of cases where when they report a rape , the police tell them , ' are n't you happy that you got a real man for a change			0
' " the use of the term " corrective rape " started three years ago after the rape and murder of @entity105 , a well - known soccer player who lived openly as a lesbian			0
@entity11 's attack is similar to the soccer player 's in some ways : police say they were both raped and stabbed to death			1
and just like @entity113 , @entity105 's body was dumped in a public place in the same township			2
two men were found guilty in the soccer star 's death and sentenced to prison terms , but the judges quashed any motions linking her attack to her sexual orientation			0
" @entity11 's death is the latest in a long series of sadistic crimes against lesbians , gay men , and transgender people in @entity4 , " said @entity124 , researcher in the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights program at @entity15			1
" police and other @entity4 officials fail to acknowledge that members of the lgbt community are raped , beaten and killed simply because of how they look or identify , and they are attacked by men who then walk freely , boasting of their exploits , " said @entity124			1
a police spokesman slammed the accusations , and said authorities are working to ensure safety for all			0
" it is our responsibility to provide safety , and we take that job seriously , " said col. @entity146 , the provincial spokesman for @entity42			0
the spokesman said there have been no arrests in @entity11 's killing , but investigations are under way			0
" we 're following some leads , and in this specific case , we 'd like to ask anyone with information to contact the police , " he said			0
" they can even do so anonymously if they are scared			0
" outspoken gay rights activists have faced harassment and attacks in the nation , @entity15 said			0
homosexuality is illegal in most @entity4 countries , based on rules left over from the @entity173 colonial era when sodomy laws were introduced			1
however , the post-apartheid constitution bans prejudice against gays in @entity4 , the first @entity4 nation to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation			1
despite the law , attacks based on sexual orientation are still going on , rights groups said			0
the new task force is scheduled to start working in july			1
it will address issues such as whether police and social workers should undergo sensitivity training , and whether rapists who target sexual minorities should get harsher sentences			2
@entity67 said having the anti-prejudicial constitution in place is an indicator that the task force alone wo n't resolve underlying problems			1
" @entity4 is a very misogynist and homophobic society , " she said			1
" we welcome the task team , but it wo n't solve social problems			2
we need to address the culture of accountability in judicial and social institutions , we need to address the attitudes ... disrupt the culture of impunity			2
