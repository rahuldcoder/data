-- you do n't have to be a science major to know that heat rises : just step into an attic on a hot summer day			2
but what you might not know is that this basic scientific reality could also help create clean energy for entire cities			2
for centuries , architects have taken advantage of rising heat to help cool some structures			0
solar chimneys allow the rising air to go out of the building , taking the heat with it			2
today , @entity20 entrepreneur @entity19 wants to take advantage of that phenomenon -- with a twist			1
he wants to create , capture and control hot air to help power cities			1
he plans to build a huge solar updraft tower , 2,600 feet tall , in the @entity28 desert			1
as the hot air moves into the tower , it would turn 32 turbines , spinning them fast enough to create mechanical energy , which generators convert to electricity			1
his company , @entity36 , says such a tower can create up to 200 megawatts of power , enough to power 100,000 homes			1
he says they do n't intend to put coal or nuclear or alternative power out of business , but want to be a strong , no - carbon emission supplementary source			0
" one of the most important things i think that differentiates this from anything else is its ability to produce power as and when required , " said @entity19 , chief executive and executive director of @entity36 , the company behind the solar updraft tower			1
that sets it apart from solar ( not available at night ) and wind energy ( not available on a calm day ) , which he referred to as " spasmodic			0
" he also touted its ability to produce power without the use of water to generate electricity			2
coal - fired and nuclear plants use massive quantities of water , and solar panels need to be washed frequently to keep them working well			0
on the drawing board the @entity36 tower is only a concept right now , but @entity19 says the technology has been proved by a different company 's smaller version that worked for seven years on the plains of @entity78			1
it created 50 kilowatts of electricity , according to that company , the @entity80 builders @entity81 , @entity82 and partner			1
but the 125 - ton iron structure toppled in 1989 after its support cables broke in a lengthy storm , a spokeswoman for @entity88 , @entity82 and partner , said in an e-mail			2
the tower had already collected all the data to prove it could work , she added			2
a small tower began operation in @entity99 last year , according to the @entity101 news agency			2
the @entity99 company 's project reportedly will cost $ 208 million and will be built in phases			0
the first section of the plant produces 200 kilowatts per day , @entity101 reported			0
@entity36 is the only publicly traded developer working on this technology , a company spokeswoman said			1
its model calls for a tower with no support wires and , unlike the other structures , it will be built from cement			0
the solar tower would be the second - tallest structure in the world , slightly shorter than @entity120 's @entity119 skyscraper			1
@entity36 says its tower will stand for 80 years , far longer than the average life for a field of solar panels , which some would see as an alternative with a smaller upfront cost			1
@entity19 says the @entity28 project will cost $ 750 million to build at its present size and scope ( with further refinements the price could rise or fall 10 % to 15 % , he says )			1
@entity36 has already raised " substantial capital " for its project , according to spokeswoman @entity132			1
the company also recently presold the power that would be created at one of the @entity28 facilities to the @entity139 , which comprises 12 utilities			1
@entity141 , a professor of mechanical engineering at @entity143 , says the two important concerns are : will the plant produce as much energy as @entity36 predicts and will it be economical and environmentally friendly ? " fundamentally from an engineering standpoint it is sound , " he said			2
" i believe that the question is not that this will not work at all			0
it might be the claim of 200 megawatts is not quite reachable at the peak			0
" @entity141 initially said he thought the engineers should consider composite materials like carbon fiber			0
but , after a few back - of - the - envelope calculations , he concluded , " an 800 - meter structure of composite materials can not withstand its own weight and a much more complicated structure is required			0
" according to @entity36 , the amount of carbon pollution created by the manufacture and shipment of the cement and other materials needed to build the facility will be offset after 2Â½ years of operation			1
spinning turbines create electricity the technology works like this : unlike normal solar photovoltaic panels that convert the sun 's light into energy , the @entity36 tower would create solar - thermal power , from both the sun and the wind			1
like a greenhouse , the sun heats up the air underneath a huge translucent , sloping canopy around the tower that is about as wide as a football field			2
the air is heated to about 194 degrees @entity189 ( 90 degrees @entity190 ) and then it flows into the tower , spins the turbines and rises			1
the higher the tower , the stronger the flow of air			1
the faster the turbines spin , the more electricity possible			2
after sundown , the ground continues to release heat and more electricity would be generated			0
the long road ahead @entity19 says the hurdles to getting his solar tower built are a combination of political factors , environmental policies and the cheap cost of fossil fuels			0
he wanted to build this project in his home country of @entity20 , but he says the @entity213 has a more acceptable political climate			1
he also said that for the past 10 years @entity36 has been doing its " due diligence " in designing a better solar tower plant to assure its potential private investors			1
" we had to improve the technology from what it was from when the plant in @entity78 was built to what it is now -- commercially viable , " he said			0
the plant should take about two years to build and provide up to 1,500 construction jobs , he says			0
then once the site is operating , a 30 - person staff will operate the plant , providing maintenance to the canopy and turbines , as well as security and possible tours			0
because air is free , operating costs will be minimal , he said			0
the next step is determining the final capital costs , which will take a few months			0
" and then you can work out whether the economics stack up , " he said			0
" we 've got to go to the bankers and ensure you can get it banked			0

hot air will drive turbines to create electricity , then flow out through a tall chimney
the tower will be the second tallest structure in the world
@entity36 , an @entity20 company , wants to build it in the @entity28 desert
