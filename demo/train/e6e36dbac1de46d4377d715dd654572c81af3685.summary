-- after announcing that @entity2 was taking over the blockbuster " @entity5 " franchise , @entity1 has faced plenty of speculation about what the new developer would do with one of the most popular video games			1
early reviews of " @entity5 , " due tuesday , have been positive ( with some critics saying it 's the best one yet )			1
but in the meantime , a live - action web series has been drawing the sci - fi franchise 's many fans to @entity19			1
the five - part series , " @entity5 : forward onto @entity26 , " recounts an alien attack on a planet hosting a @entity25 @entity24 military school			1
the ambush decimates the unprepared planet , leaving the survival of a handful of recruits in the balance			0
it 's a way to bring a new slice of the " @entity5 " narrative to life and whet appetites for the latest game			1
digital filmmakers and executive producers @entity40 and @entity42 came up with the idea for the web series to tell the story of a group of recruits and their connection to the games ' iconic master chief character			1
@entity42 said @entity2 wanted to make a big splash with their game and had been impressed by web videos that had been produced for other gaming titles			1
@entity55 , who was involved in the " @entity57 " digital series , was approached by @entity1 and 343 about transforming an interactive story into a linear one			2
the team had to finish the project " on what was a pretty nutty schedule , " @entity55 said			0
" we wrote , managed , produced the whole life cycle ... in a little less than a calendar year			0
" @entity55 and @entity42 brought in people who could stay true to both the " @entity5 " feel and 343 's vision of the franchise			1
the five parts were shot as a movie over 24 days and will be released on @entity72 , but @entity42 said they knew they needed break points to fit the series format			2
" we had to think about how it would work episodically because that 's how the consumers would be viewing it on @entity19 , " @entity42 said			2
" we did n't want one delivery to come at the expense of others			0
that 's really tough because there is a huge difference between what is episodic , call it television if you will , and the structure of a feature			0
" that work required a balance of action and narrative for each part of the web series , yet the entire story still needed to all flow together			1
the producers said they were also very cognizant of fans ' knowledge of the franchise and did not want to stray outside the narrative boundaries already established			2
the video story fits in to the overall storylines featured in " @entity5 " and is a literal bridge between " @entity109 " and the new video game			1
it also introduces a new character , @entity113 , who will play a role in the upcoming game			0
" for the hardcore fans that have played the games , read the books , read the comics , have the consumer products , and are fully intending to dive into ' @entity5 , ' this is very much an additive experience , " @entity42 said			1
@entity55 said they also wanted to make sure the casual or new fan could appreciate the web shows and not get lost in the vast history of the franchise			2
she said developing a story for the web needed to have its own hook but not one that was outside the overall plot line they wanted to explore			0
" it was one of the toughest things about this show			0
it 's like working in a @entity142 museum , " she said			0
" there is a whole lot of history that people care about and you 've got to be really true to , but then it is also wonderful to be able to create something new within that world			0
" the " @entity5 " series chronicles an interstellar war between humans and aliens known as the @entity155			1
the protagonist of the games ' fictional universe is master chief , a cybernetically enhanced human soldier encased in green armor			0
@entity55 and @entity42 knew the one thing they had to get right from a fan 's perspective was their portrayal of the iconic master chief			0
@entity55 said a representative from 343 was with them throughout the shooting process and was able to answer questions and point out details to keep them on the right track			0
" what we try to do with our extended fiction is create a kind of ' history ' for the universe , from which we can draw ideas , scenarios , characters and events , and connect those to the game in meaningful ways , " said @entity172 , franchise development director at 343 industries			2
" the beauty of this approach , when we get it right , is that for fans of that extended fiction , both the game and the related stories end up having more resonance and meaning			2
but for folks who simply play the games , the story of the game feels like it comes from a richer , deeper foundation			0
" @entity55 said they had access to the developer 's art department to represent the imposing master chief with an accuracy that fans would appreciate			0
" this was an area we knew we could n't veer in any way shape or form , and we 'd be crazy to , " @entity42 said			0
" we had to make the best , most authentic master chief gear that you could make			0
" @entity213 , the actor selected for the beloved role , is an imposing presence on the screen			0
@entity213 also does all the stunts and action scenes in the web series			1
one of the bridges between " @entity109 " and " @entity5 " is a series of flashbacks to master chief 's artificial - intelligence sidekick , @entity225 , and what happens to her after the spaceship , " @entity26 , " is ripped in half at the end of " @entity109			1
" @entity42 said he thinks casual and hardcore fans will appreciate some new insight as they get ready to play " @entity5			1
" part 1 of the live - action web series was released in october , and the final episode was revealed just days before tuesday 's official " @entity5 " release			1
more than 8 million people watched the first episode on @entity19			2
it will be interesting to see how many continue the story in the video game .			1
