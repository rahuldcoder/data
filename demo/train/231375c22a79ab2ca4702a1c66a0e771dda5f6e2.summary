-- one of the most anticipated @entity2 seasons gets under way tuesday night			1
@entity5 ' decision to leave the @entity6 to join the @entity7 and fellow stars @entity8 and @entity10 , fueled passionate off - season conversation about him and the league			1
while the focus this season is what will take place on the court , there are financial issues looming for the @entity2 that many expect will result in a work stoppage next season			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity24 @entity2 analyst @entity23 about the excitement around this week 's league openers and the economic clouds looming next season			1
below is an edited transcript of that interview			0
@entity0 : what should fans expect from @entity5 early in the season ? @entity23 : they can expect the usual highlight reel play			1
that 's not going to change			0
but i think fans need to temper their expectations for the team			2
it takes some time for the team to find its identity and find their roles especially with @entity8 injured for most of the pre-season			2
i think it 's going be fun to watch it all unfold			0
@entity0 : so fans should n't wonder why the team is n't on pace for 75 wins ( teams play 82 games ) from day one ? @entity23 : i get that question a lot since i was on the [ @entity2 record ] 72 win team in @entity59 [ in 1996 ]			1
it is pretty unique and i do n't think it will ever happen again , but @entity7 is going to win a ton of games			1
i do n't think anyone will ever win 73 but they will probably be in the 60s , and if things go really well they could be in the high 60s			2
@entity0 : @entity5 told @entity0 that he thought race played a role in the criticism of " the decision " and he recently re-tweeted a racially charged tweet someone sent him			1
will this result in people seeing a different side of @entity5 , perhaps not the carefree kid they saw for many years in @entity6 ? @entity23 : i think this whole thing has to have hardened him and given him a different perspective on people			1
i think if you combine " the decision " tv show with the fact that he has n't won a title , he 's starting to feel pressure and people maybe do n't look at him as the " boy wonder " anymore			2
it 's more " when are you gon na win ? " that brings a lot of pressure , an edge and that comes with the territory and i think he understands that			1
he has to go out and win a title at some point to validate his legacy			1
watch @entity5 ' new commercial @entity0 : you were a general manager and a player , so you 've seen the league 's economics from both sides			1
the @entity2 is projecting about $ 350 million in losses this season -- do you think that 's an accurate figure ? @entity23 : yes			1
having been on the management and seeing a lot of numbers both in @entity118 and elsewhere , i think that 's an accurate number			0
@entity0 : how did it get to that point ? @entity23 : rising player costs			1
the salaries really exploded and you combine that with the downturn in the economy			0
... it 's been a tough go for most of the teams in the league			2
it 's like a lot of other things in the country : people do n't have a lot of spending money and the first thing you cut back on is your entertainment expenses			0
the other factor is that when the owners bought franchises 30 years ago , they knew they were sitting on a huge franchise value escalation			0
they bought it for $ 20 million and they knew it would grow and they could afford to lose some money knowing they could eventually cash in			0
but now you have a whole group of owners that bought - in at $ 300 - 400 million , so owners are n't sitting on that huge payoff at the end that they used to be , so there 's a little different mentality on a year - to - year basis			0
@entity0 : is it realistic that player costs can be reduced by 1/3 as the commissioner @entity163 says he wants to do ? @entity23 : i do n't think anyone really knows			1
usually in these situations , @entity163 's the master in these negotiations for sure and everything he says is calculated and there 's a plan behind it and maybe the plan is go for 1/3 and get 1/4 -- i do n't know			0
he knows what he wants , he knows how to get it , and he also knows that it is a partnership with the players and there has to be compromise and we 'll see how it all unfolds			2
@entity0 : how hard might the players fight this ? @entity23 : having been through it in 1999 ( the last @entity2 lockout ) the end result was the players gave up more than the owners did and that 's usually the way it works			1
you have 450 players versus 30 owners and the owners have other businesses , and generally speaking the owners are going to be able to weather the storm easier than the players are			2
that said , the owners are going to lose a lot of money in a lockout too			0
i think it 's something that 'll be resolved but usually the owners come out with the better end of the deal			0
@entity0 : what are the odds that there will be a lockout next year ? @entity23 : i think the odds are pretty good it 's impossible to give a number			1
i think circumstances are very unique , probably more severe than in 1999 because of economic conditions in this country , and the fact that a lot of the owner 's other businesses may be struggling a little bit			0
@entity0 : what should fans watch for in the early part of the season ? @entity23 : can the @entity226 stay healthy and motivated ? they 're trying to get to their fourth straight @entity2 finals which is very hard to do			1
watch @entity231 -- can he sustain it for another full season ? @entity59 has made a lot of improvement			0
@entity236 is the team that 's flying under the radar			0
everybody is watching @entity240 and @entity7			0
nobody is talking about @entity236			0
they have the best defensive player in the league , @entity243 , and they 're going to pose a lot of problems for everybody			2
@entity0 : is @entity236 your surprise winner ? @entity23 : i picked @entity7 to play the @entity226 , with the @entity226 winning			2
but it would n't shock me at all if @entity236 got to the finals .			0
