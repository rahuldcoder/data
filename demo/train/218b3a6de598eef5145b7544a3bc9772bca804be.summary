-- the phenomenal success of " @entity2 " has been a game changer for its entire cast , including actor @entity5			1
the show 's high ratings , three consecutive @entity9 wins for outstanding comedy series and broad fan base have given all its stars a massive platform			2
@entity5 is using his for a cause that 's both political and personal : the fight to legalize same - sex marriage			1
the 37 - year - old @entity18 native does n't just play @entity19 , a gay man in a loving , committed relationship on tv ; in a way , he is @entity23 after dating for more than two years , @entity5 and his boyfriend , @entity24 , decided to take the next step			1
during a recent trip to @entity28 , @entity5 " popped the big @entity26 " @entity24 said yes			1
after much consideration and debate , the newly engaged couple decided to go public with their private news , not because they do n't enjoy their privacy -- they certainly do -- but because in doing so they knew they could shine a light on a cause dear to their hearts			2
@entity5 and @entity42 started the @entity44 foundation			1
its mission is simple : sell bow ties to raise money for marriage equality			1
the " @entity2 " actor recently spoke with @entity0 about his organization			1
@entity0 : when you go to @entity55 , the first thing you see is a hilarious video of you and @entity24 announcing your engagement			1
@entity58 : i feel like when you tackle any subject with comedy , humor and wits , you 're going to get a lot further than if you just give the dry facts of the cause			2
@entity0 : it definitely gets your attention			2
it could n't have been an easy decision to put your private life out there like that			2
@entity5 : we kind of felt like the only way to legitimize why we wanted to do this was to announce that we were actually engaged			1
it made me very nervous ; i did n't want to exploit something that was very personal and private between @entity24 and me			1
but , in the context of our foundation , it felt like ( it was ) the right time to tell people			1
@entity0 : my favorite part was your struggle with labeling your relationship			1
@entity5 : i hate " lover " ! i think it sounds so pretentious and like that " @entity94 " skit with @entity90 and @entity91 in the hot tub eating turkey			1
i 've always found the term fiance in gay or straight relationships to be completely strange			2
it does n't sound @entity98 or @entity99 at all			2
i love calling @entity24 " the lover i 've taken on , " but he does n't care for that			1
so i just say " boyfriend			2
" i think there 's something really sweet and innocent about it			2
@entity0 : a lot of boyfriends , and girlfriends in @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 got some good news on @entity112 when same - sex marriage was legalized in those states by popular vote			1
@entity5 : i have such mixed feelings about it			1
obviously , i 'm so happy these states won marriage equality			1
it 's also very tough for me			2
i went through it with @entity122 ( in @entity123 ) , seeing the majority vote on the minority 's rights			2
it 's incredibly hard to swallow			2
i just feel like it should n't be up to the majority to vote on a minority 's civil rights			2
i 'm thrilled that we are slowly making progress , and we have to make progress however we can			2
but i do look forward to the day we stop putting it in the hands of the states and make it a national thing			2
this is @entity99 and ( marriage equality ) should be part of the " @entity146 " part of our country			1
@entity0 : what do you see as the biggest challenge between where things are now and the protection of same - sex marriage under federal law ? @entity5 : we 're in a great place			1
there 's a forward movement on this issue , and for many young americans it 's a nonissue			2
but one stumbling block is the lack of education about marriage equality			1
i feel like there 's a fear that the definition of marriage will be changed			1
nobody 's looking to change the meaning of what it means to be married			2
we just want to add to who has the right			0
it 's the same thing as women wanting the right to vote			0
they were n't going to change the meaning of going to the polls and putting the card in the ballot ; they just wanted the right to vote			0
@entity0 : and whether you 're voting or getting married , who does n't like to wear a nice bow tie , right ? why did you pick this accessory as the cornerstone of your foundation ? @entity5 : i selfishly wanted to get involved in the fashion world anyway , but in a way that did n't feel like a huge undertaking			1
so i thought about what i like to wear and also what is literally the smallest piece of clothing i could possibly design			0
so we came up with the bow - tie line			1
it was @entity24 's idea to incorporate it into the foundation			1
we thought -- why do n't we kill two birds with one stone ? we 'll start a bow - tie line and funnel the proceeds into a foundation for marriage equality			1
then @entity24 came up with the idea of @entity210 , which just perfectly marries those two ideas			1
@entity0 : i think people will appreciate the symbolism			0
also , it matches your character in " @entity2			0
" i imagine your cast mates have been supportive			0
the chemistry there really seems to go beyond the set			0
is that the case ? @entity5 : i mean it really is			1
people are always trying to test us and break us and find out the darkness , but there 's really nothing to tell			0
we 're kind of on this roller coaster together , and it 's a very bonding experience			0
we 're watching our families grow			0
i 've gotten engaged since meeting these people			0
@entity234 ( @entity235 ) has had two kids			0
@entity237 ( @entity238 ) had twins			0
@entity240 ( @entity241 ) got engaged			0
we 'll go to a birthday party or get together at someone 's house and bring our husbands , wives , fiances , boyfriends and girlfriends , and it feels like a huge extended family			0
@entity0 : i bet when one of your family members finds themselves at the center of a crazy headline or serious crisis you all react			0
do you turn into @entity259 ? @entity5 : there 's obviously some sense of protection because we know being ( in ) the media 's eye how vulnerable that can be when you 're going through something			1
so we all rally around one another and protect one another			0
we 're always checking in with one another , and some walls definitely go up to protect some people			0
it 's exactly what you would expect from people who have your back			0
@entity0 : i can only imagine what a " @entity2 " gay wedding will be like			0
i bet you and @entity24 get asked a lot when the big day is			1
@entity5 : about once a day ! we 're in the process of planning it			1
it could be as early as this spring , and it could be the following spring			0
we 're kind of waiting for some pieces to fall into place and to see what my work schedule is like next summer			0
i 'm also really excited to be married			0
i do n't want to have a three - year engagement			1
i proposed to @entity24 because i wanted to be married			1
i do n't want to be a professional engaged person			0
@entity0 : are you planning something more traditional or , dare i say , modern ? @entity5 : well , we 're not going to be redefining the marriage ceremony			1
i grew up catholic but do n't practice any longer			0
i have n't been to the @entity300 in years so i would feel really weird to try and bring in those traditions -- it 's just not us			0
it 's going to be a very nontraditional , very organic , very simple ceremony			0
we 're not going to have a wedding party or try to find someone amazing to officiate			0
i think it will be a very short , very sweet and simple and hopefully beautiful ceremony			0
i do n't even have any gay friends who have gotten married , but several of my straight friends had very untraditional weddings , and those have always been my favorite			0
@entity0 : have you decided about starting a family ? @entity5 : it 's something we 've talked about			1
it 's one of those early date questions			0
" do you want kids ? " and we both do			0
but i 'm just excited to get married and sit in the marriage place for a little while			2
i do n't want to jump into kids right away			0
but , yeah , we both really want kids very much .			0
