-- in an almost unbearably predictable recurrence of conflict between @entity4 and the @entity6 - led @entity5 , the two find themselves once again squaring off for another round in the never - ending vicious cycle of violence			1
nearly four years after the deadly " @entity12 " operation , @entity4 's military has embarked on a new operation , this time codenamed " @entity14 , " killing the most senior military @entity6 commander and escalating pre-existing hostilities			1
the hundreds of rockets that have been fired from @entity5 at @entity4 following the assassination and @entity4 air and artillery attacks come as no surprise : it is all too familiar			2
however , this round of violence is taking place in a very different @entity26 to the one in which both sides clashed on a similar scale at the end of 2008			1
from @entity33 and @entity34 to @entity35 and @entity36 , civil uprisings and revolutions have rapidly changed the political and social landscape of the region			1
these changes , together with the ever - present @entity41 and @entity6 's improving military capabilities , are creating new realities which also affect the environment in which the @entity4 - @entity46 conflict is conducted			1
the border between @entity5 and @entity4 is never entirely peaceful , always on the verge of full - blown war			2
trouble regularly flares as result of tit - for - tat attacks which spiral out of control , or because of military and political considerations			0
like " @entity12 , " this operation is taking place just a few weeks after @entity4 elections were declared -- they will be held in january next year			1
soon after prime minister @entity60 's announcement , @entity4 allegedly bombed a military arms factory in @entity62 , @entity63 , which supplied arms to the @entity6 in @entity5			1
notwithstanding the constant provocation of rockets fired on @entity4 towns and villages by @entity6 and its allies in @entity5 , the proximity of @entity4 's attack to their impending elections does n't seem to be a coincidence			1
there is almost a long standing political tradition by @entity4 governments to avert attention from their social and economic failures			2
launching a military campaign against an obvious , albeit not innocent , enemy will bring short term military and potential electoral success			0
however , it will only exacerbate the situation			0
@entity87 was long a marked man , considering his involvement in hundreds of deadly attacks on @entity4			0
nevertheless , he had also shown pragmatism in the protection of , and deal to release , the kidnapped @entity4 soldier @entity92			0
according to @entity93 , an @entity4 peace activist who was involved in the negotiations to release @entity92 , @entity87 was very seriously considering a permanent ceasefire with @entity4			0
bearing in mind his prominence within the organisation , this might have led to a significant and critical change in relations between these two sworn enemies			0
in the past , @entity4 heavy - handedness with @entity6 was met with either half - hearted protestations or even tacit approval from the @entity106			1
it remains to be seen if there will be a different reaction this time , and what the long term impact on relations between @entity4 and the newly shaped region will be			2
secular regimes are quickly being replaced by @entity116 parties which have both mandates and legitimacy , having been elected in free and fair elections			0
these governments ' immediate instinct is sympathy , not only with the people of @entity5 , but also with the @entity6 government , an offshoot of the @entity127 movement which currently holds the presidency in @entity35			1
@entity35 president @entity129 wasted no time , immediately recalling his country 's ambassador to @entity4 to @entity132 and vowing to stand by the people of @entity5 " until we stop the aggression			1
" on friday , @entity35 's prime minister @entity134 called on the world to stop @entity4 " aggression , " describing @entity4 's actions as a disaster			1
both countries have a strategic interest not to let the situation in @entity5 endanger the peace treaty which was signed more than 30 years ago , even if the @entity127 has always been critical of it			0
it is also an opportunity for @entity35 to show its leadership and broker a ceasefire -- doing so would enhance the country 's international credibility in the @entity150 era			0
elsewhere , the @entity152 foreign minister called the events in @entity5 a " filthy crime " which should not go unpunished			0
this is strong language from one of @entity4 's less critical neighbours in the region			1
it is conceivable that events unfolding in @entity36 will bring more religious elements into government when , more likely than if , the @entity164 regime falls			0
this , coupled with ongoing disquiet in @entity167 , makes @entity4 's position in the region seem more precarious than it has been for a long time			1
the current show of force by @entity4 may be aimed at sending a clear message to its neighbors that its policy of using its military might whenever it deems necessary has n't changed , especially amid growing concerns that the civil war in @entity36 is gradually spilling over into the occupied @entity177			2
moreover , @entity60 and his defence minister @entity178 signal that despite elevating the containment of @entity41 nuclear programme to the top of their priority list , they wo n't neglect strategic challenges closer to home			0
@entity4 's policy of the uncompromising use of force may prove counterproductive , both military and politically			2
no one questions the right of @entity4 citizens to live free of rocket attacks from @entity5 , yet time and again it has proven that the army can provide a very limited solution			2
militarily , the first few days of hostilities have proved that the @entity199 interception system is only partially successful , and @entity6 rockets can reach as far as @entity201 and its neighboring cities , exposing @entity4 's vulnerability			1
however , even more alarming is the lack of political wisdom in learning from the past that the use of excessive force only leads to further radicalization of @entity46 society , a future of increasing bloodshed between @entity4 and @entity46 , and the deterioration of relations with the @entity216 world			1
this is increasingly so as a result of the @entity219			0
the answer to @entity4 security challenges lies around the negotiation table			0
unfortunately , the current government in @entity4 has no political plan that can bring about peace , and believes its ability to regain power at the next elections relies on a show of military force instead of diplomatic efforts and a genuine peace process			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			0

@entity238 nothing new , but current violence is taking place in a very different @entity26
@entity235 says region 's political , social landscape changed by the @entity219
@entity235 : new regimes ' instinct is sympathy with people of @entity5 , @entity6 government
@entity4 's lack of political wisdom in learning from the past is alarming , says @entity235
