-- five years ago , @entity1 stood trial on two murder charges			1
now he stands accused again , this time of allegedly killing three people -- apparently strangers to him -- in a tranquil @entity9 , @entity10 , neighborhood			1
two other victims are fighting for their lives in a local hospital , @entity12 prosecutor @entity11 said on wednesday			0
prosecutors did n't win a conviction in the 2009 murder trial against @entity1 , in part because the bodies of the two victims were never found			1
but this time could be different , the prosecutor says			0
" i woke up this morning , very determined and resolved to get justice in this case , " @entity11 said upon learning @entity1 had been charged again with murder			1
" and that 's what we 're going to do			2
" @entity1 , 34 , was arrested after a perilous 12 hours during which three people died , two were left injured , one victim 's car was stolen and another three individuals were assaulted at a motel			1
@entity11 said that , based on the murder charges against him , a judge opted not to set bond for @entity1 , meaning he 'll be held in @entity38 presumably until his trial on the new charges			1
meanwhile , those affected by the violence he 's accused of -- from the two hospitalized victims , to kin of the three people killed , to neighbors , to those allegedly attacked at the hotel -- have a hard road ahead as well			1
they 're challenged to come to grips with the brutal , seemingly random nature of what happened			0
" it scares all of us , " @entity11 said			0
" because that is a beautiful , peaceful neighborhood , and it got hit tragically by a senseless , senseless acts of violence			2
" but that perpetrator is behind bars right now , " she added			0
3 people killed were ages 63 , 69 , 88 the first sign of trouble came shortly after noon tuesday , when a woman called 911 and said briefly , " help at address , shotgun			1
" then the call ended			0
@entity9 police responded to find a woman , later identified as 69 - year - old @entity73 , dead on a driveway , according to a probable cause statement			1
they then went inside a neighbor 's home and found a male and female apparently " assaulted and ... severely injured " in the basement			1
in a front yard a few doors down , authorities came across 63 - year - old @entity85 and his 88 - year - old mother @entity86 -- both of whom had been shot dead			1
witnesses shed more light on what happened , according to police , including how @entity73 was shot by a man with a shotgun after she 'd left her residence			0
not only that , but the suspect had sped away in a @entity95 belonging to one of his victims			0
it led to a @entity100 , where three people -- one of whom had cuts on his head -- told police they 'd been followed by a man and assaulted , before the alleged assailant ran off on foot			1
the discovery of the stolen @entity95 a short ways down the road helped authorities make the connection : the man allegedly behind the quintuple shootings was also the man at the hotel			2
six hours later -- just before midnight ( 1 a.m. et wednesday ) -- they had a suspect in custody , @entity1			2
they also had what @entity11 says was the murder weapon , a 12 - gauge shotgun that still had " four shotgun shells in the magazine tube , making it readily capable of lethal use , " according to the probable cause statement			2
suspect is a convicted felon the fact that @entity1 had that gun was reason enough for authorities to charge him with unlawful possession of a firearm			1
he was convicted in a @entity9 court in 2000 of aggravated kidnapping , aggravated assault and attempted aggravated robbery			1
convicted felons are n't supposed to have guns -- even if they 'd purchased them , as was true in this case , prior to their conviction			0
questioned about why a convicted felon allegedly did possess a gun , @entity11 responded : " did law enforcement go door - to - door to check under pillows or his bed for firearms ? probably not			2
" but he 's a convicted felon and fully understands that ... you 're not allowed to possess a firearm			0
" @entity1 faces three first - degree murder , two first - degree assault , burglary and other charges			1
it 's also possible that this case -- or at least the shotgun -- could shed light on the first time that @entity1 was charged with murder in the deaths of @entity167 and @entity168			1
@entity11 said she called the @entity171 and @entity172 families , as well as the prosecutors who tried but failed to win a conviction in their deaths , soon after @entity1 was connected to these new killings			2
@entity9 mayor @entity178 recalled that being a difficult case to prosecute , absent the victims ' bodies or witnesses : " ( prosecutors ) did everything they could			2
but in a circumstance like that , you have to have almost overwhelming evidence			0
and that evidence simply was not there			0
" this time around , authorities have a lot more to work with			0
they have victims , they have a weapon , they have ballistic evidence , and they have witnesses			0
" from this point , " @entity11 said , " we will roll up our sleeves and get to work			0
" @entity0 's @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity1 , 34 , faces first - degree murder , assault and other charges
new : he 's accused of killing 3 , wounding 2 others in a @entity9 neighborhood
new : authorities say he then assaulted people at a @entity100 , before being caught
new : a @entity9 jury *acquitted* @entity1 on 2 murder charges in 2009
