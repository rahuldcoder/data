@entity1 gov. @entity0 is one of the @entity3 's brightest stars , a 42 - year - old @entity4 , a dynamo fundraiser and a favorite of national @entity3 eager to showcase diversity in their ranks			1
@entity0 's road to re-election this november has looked smooth of late , thanks to @entity13 's unpopularity in @entity1 , a shrinking unemployment rate and the cautious approach of her @entity17 challenger , state sen. @entity16			1
but @entity0 's path to victory might have just become more complicated			1
that 's because a little - known attorney and former judge named @entity24 has joined the race for governor as an independent -- and his campaign is threatening to raise at least $ 6 million in the process			1
" we 're going to spend whatever it takes , " @entity24 told @entity29			1
" i am going to tell the truth to the people of @entity1			0
" @entity24 entered the race clumsily			1
in march , he filed to run against @entity0 in the @entity3 primary , loaning his campaign $ 420,000 as seed money			1
he promptly unleashed $ 65,000 worth of robocalls attacking the governor			0
but he soon dropped out of the primary and announced his independent bid , saying there was n't enough to time to mount a credible @entity3 campaign before the june 10 primary			1
@entity0 's campaign was quick to diminish @entity24 as a " liberal trial lawyer			1
" " we appreciate mr. @entity24 's desire for public service , but a trial lawyer and former @entity17 lawmaker â€Ž who wants to raise taxes and embrace @entity13 should probably be running as a @entity54 , " said @entity0 spokesman @entity47			1
" governor @entity0 is focused on the legislative session , passing historic education and ethics reforms and keeping the fantastic economic and jobs momentum going			1
and we look forward to running against two liberal trial lawyers who support @entity13 instead of just one			0
" rumors of a shadow campaign @entity24 's audacious , last - minute entry into the race has been met with eye - rolls by @entity3			1
a popular rumor in @entity66 is that his candidacy is little more than a shadow campaign aided by trial attorneys who have long clashed with the pro-business governor and want a spoiler in the race			0
@entity0 defeated @entity16 by just four points when they first squared off in the 2010 race			2
some democrats are hopeful that @entity24 , and his money , will help them open up a two - front war against @entity0 on the campaign trail , while siphoning @entity3 - leaning voters away from the incumbent			1
a libertarian candidate , @entity82 businessman @entity81 , could do the same			0
others , though , are concerned that @entity24 will hurt rather than help their cause by divvying up the existing @entity86 vote , thereby hurting @entity16 , who needs to grow his support in a @entity3 - dominated state			1
" i think it could hurt , " said @entity89 , a former @entity17 chairman in the state			2
" there are a lot of moderate @entity17 , a lot of people who would have voted for @entity16 who may gravitate to @entity24 now if he throws a punch			1
it may balkanize the @entity86 vote			1
that may be in play now			0
" adding intrigue to @entity24 's candidacy is the behind - the - curtain presence of @entity3 consultant @entity105 , the mercurial former @entity106 and @entity108 strategist who is consulting on the campaign			1
@entity105 , a screwdriver - sipping @entity110 who tweets prolifically about the @entity111 , has never been shy about sticking his finger in the eye of his fellow @entity3			2
after @entity106 lost his bid for the presidency in 2000 , @entity105 briefly dabbled in @entity17 politics and feuded with @entity117 during the @entity118 years			2
during the @entity108 campaign , he called @entity3 " a bunch of cranks " in the pages of @entity123			2
@entity24 's campaign is not the first time he 's worked against the @entity3 on a governor 's race : in 2010 , he advised the ill - fated candidacy of @entity129 , a @entity54 - turned - independent candidate for @entity131 governor			1
' a breath of fresh air ' " i was honored when @entity24 called me three weeks ago about being a member of his team , " @entity105 said in an email			2
" we tried to recruit him twice for sen. @entity106 in our two primaries in @entity1 -- and failed			0
i know @entity24 to be a social and economic conservative and also extremely straight forward and bold in his vision for the state			2
he 'll be a breath of fresh air for sure as the next @entity3 governor			2
" @entity24 revealed his first ad on monday , calling himself " an independent @entity3 " and criticizing @entity0 on a number of issues , including the massive 2012 data breach at the @entity1 @entity151 that exposed nearly 4 million @entity153 numbers			1
@entity24 's chances of winning the race are slim			1
there 's no modern precedent for a candidate without party support winning statewide in @entity1			0
he first has to qualify to get on the november ballot by collecting at least 10,000 signatures needed to run as a " petition " candidate			0
meanwhile , @entity0 's campaign has raised nearly $ 6 million for her campaign , a hefty sum in a state where television ad time is relatively affordable , and she has been aided by a series of commercials paid for by the @entity172			1
in one hard - edged ad that began airing this week , the @entity172 blasts @entity16 , an attorney and state senator , for legal work defending a sex offender and domestic abusers			0
the @entity179 called the ad " desperate			0
" @entity24 sees an opening			2
sitting for an interview inside the wood - paneled lobby of @entity184 , an @entity185 radio station he purchased out of bankruptcy last year , the soft - spoken @entity24 said his decision to drop out of the @entity3 primary will give him time to raise money and get his message out			1
had he remained in the @entity3 race , it would have allowed @entity0 to line her war chest by going back to her donors and soliciting even more money for the primary campaign			1
questioning @entity0 's commitment @entity24 served one term in the @entity1 legislature 30 years ago as a @entity54 , and ran for a seat again in 2005 as a @entity3 , but lost			1
a practicing attorney involved with charitable work in the @entity204 area , he said he has been active in local politics for years			0
he said he did not vote in the last gubernatorial election			0
" we have no leadership in @entity66 right now , " @entity24 said			2
" governor @entity0 has been a disaster			2
every agency she has touched is in crisis mode			0
she is clearly focused on her own selfish political ambitions			0
if she is re-elected , i seriously doubt she will finish out her term			0
she has got her eyes on @entity216			0
all she can talk about is federal issues , when our state is languishing			0
" @entity24 pointed to the state 's " crumbling " roads and bridges , education policy and government transparency as issues he plans to highlight			1
he said a gas tax is " on the table , " and he 'd likely sign a budget increasing fees if it passed the state legislature , but his positions hew closer to conservative orthodoxy			0
@entity24 wants to eliminate the personal income tax and says he opposes the expansion of @entity236 under the @entity13 , although he previously told @entity238 newspaper he would not veto @entity236 expansion if the state balanced the budget			2
as a born - again @entity242 , he 's against same - sex marriage and abortion			0
but mainly , he said he wants to make the race a referendum on @entity0 's first term			1
@entity24 applied a lighter touch to @entity16 , calling him a " career politician " and " far to the left			2
" but he also described the @entity54 as a " policy wonk " with " a good understanding of the issues			0
" @entity16 's campaign had no comment on @entity24			1
@entity24 's sudden appearance on the political scene , his blistering criticisms of @entity0 and his ties to the state 's legal community -- his wife is a prominent worker 's compensation attorney -- have fueled talk in the state capital that he was recruited into the race by @entity3 fundraiser @entity268 , a longtime @entity0 nemesis			1
a remarkable moment @entity270 fiercely opposed @entity0 during her first gubernatorial campaign in 2010			2
after she won , he memorably filed a lawsuit and then an ethics complaint against the governor , claiming she profited from her office while serving in the state legislature			0
that complaint was dismissed , but not before @entity0 defended herself before the state 's ethics panel and , in a remarkable moment , called @entity270 " a racist , sexist bigot who has tried everything in his power to hurt me and my family			1
" @entity24 acknowledged being friendly with @entity270 's brother , but denied that he is a stalking horse for the legal community			1
" since i was a circuit court judge for 14 years , i do know a number of attorneys , " he said			0
" and there will be some of my friends that will contribute to my campaign			0
but i do n't expect to get the endorsement of the trial lawyers			0
" " i do n't know @entity105 well enough to approach him , " @entity24 said of @entity270			2
" i may , because he wants some change in state government as well			0
he may be motivated to give			0
but @entity105 has not contributed to my campaign			0
" @entity270 , too , denied any connection to @entity24 's campaign			1
" no , " he said flatly when asked if he recruited @entity304 to run			0
" there is nothing else to say			0
" still , @entity270 had harsh words for @entity0 , calling her " corrupt to the core of her being			2
" in the next breath , he gamed out a scenario in which @entity24 could open the door to a @entity16 victory			1
" i think he appeals to centrist @entity3 , some of whom do n't want to vote for somebody with a d by their name , but who would vote for someone with @entity3 credentials , " @entity270 said			1
" if you can get somebody who can carve off 5 % of the vote , @entity16 can win			0
there is no question he can win			0
" @entity328 , a former @entity1 @entity3 chairman , said @entity24 and his wife " have been very successful in the legal business			1
" but , he added , " i do n't take it very seriously			0
" " they are not going to shake a lot of votes loose from @entity3 , " @entity328 said			2
" if they are going to spend a couple million , that 's their choice			0
he can do what he wants with his money			0
if i was @entity24 and i was looking for some excitement , i would n't run as an independent for governor in a @entity3 state			1
he 'd be better off if he bought a new sports car and got a girlfriend and got it out of his system			0

@entity24 was running as a @entity3 but withdrew and entered as an independent
incumbent @entity0 is one of the @entity3 's brightest stars
some *republicans* think @entity17 are behind @entity24 's campagin to split @entity3 vote
some democrats think @entity24 could split the @entity86 vote and assure her victory
