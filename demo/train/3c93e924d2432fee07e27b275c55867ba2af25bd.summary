@entity0 -- the @entity2 on friday began releasing the names of visitors as part of a @entity7 campaign promise to run a more transparent administration			1
last month , @entity9 , special counsel to the president for ethics and government reform , said records of @entity2 visitors would be made available to the public on an ongoing basis beginning in december			1
" we will achieve our goal of making this administration the most open and transparent administration in history not only by opening the doors of the @entity2 to more @entity23 , but by shining a light on the business conducted inside it , " he said			1
" @entity23 have a right to know whose voices are being heard in the policymaking process			0
" as part of that initiative , he offered to look back at records from before the announcement			0
@entity9 said friday that 110 disclosure requests from september have been processed , yielding nearly 500 visitor records that have been posted on the @entity2 web site			2
since the release covers only those records that are at least 90 days old , the first records cover january 20 to july 31			0
" this first release is only the latest in a series of unprecedented steps by the president to increase openness in government , " @entity9 said			0
given that up to 100,000 people visit the @entity2 each month , the names published friday included people with some very familiar names -- including @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 -- that did not belong to their more famous counterparts , he said			1
" the well - known individuals with those names never actually came to the @entity2 , " @entity9 said			2
