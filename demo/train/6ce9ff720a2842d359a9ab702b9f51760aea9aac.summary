@entity0 -- as president @entity2 approaches day 100 of his administration , some in @entity0 caution that the torture tug - of - war could be a costly distraction			1

earlier this month , the @entity2 administration released four @entity14 - era memos detailing " enhanced interrogations " of suspected @entity17 members			1
now , the @entity18 is reviewing former vice president @entity20 's request to make more memos public			1
two weeks before @entity2 released any memos , @entity20 submitted a request to the @entity24 calling for the release of other documents			1
he says that what he requested will prove that the @entity14 interrogation tactics -- which critics have called a torture program -- worked			1
" i have n't talked about it , but i know specifically of reports that i read , that i saw , that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country , " @entity20 said in an interview with @entity32 last week			1
the @entity18 is signaling that not only is it considering honoring @entity20 's request , it may go even further			2
" i think the president , as you know , is a big believer in transparency , " @entity18 press secretary @entity43 said sunday on @entity45 's " @entity44			2
" " i think one of the things that will have to be examined is whether there are additional memos that have to be released that give a broader picture of what 's gone on in enhanced interrogation techniques			1
" the almost daily revelations are dividing @entity58 between those calling for full disclosure and those urging caution			1
" we do n't just turn the page without reading it			0
we want to make sure what the mistakes were so that the @entity2 administration does n't make these mistakes , " sen. @entity70 , @entity71			0
but sen. @entity72 , @entity73 , warned sunday against moving to quickly			0
" we need to find these things out , and we need to do it in a way that 's calm and deliberative and professional , because i think all of this , on the front burner , before the public , does harm our intelligence gathering , it does harm @entity85 's position in the world , " she said on @entity1 's " @entity74			0
" across the aisle , republicans are insisting the @entity89 drop any investigation of @entity14 administration officials who authorized harsh interrogations			1
" i think that would be a stab in the back			0
i think he has already demoralized the @entity99 , put them in a @entity101 mode , " sen. @entity96 , @entity97 , said sunday on @entity32			0
@entity103 sen. @entity102 , the former @entity104 presidential candidate , said prosecuting those who gave legal advice is wrong			2
" i do n't think those memos should have been released , but the fundamental point now is whether to prosecute people who gave the president , in my view , legitimate advice , even though it was wrong , " he said			1
" we should not be prosecuting people who gave legal advice			0
it 's wrong to do that to them , and it sets a terrible precedent for the future			0
" rep. @entity122 of @entity123 , the top @entity104 on the @entity124 , and @entity18 minority leader @entity125 of @entity126 are calling on the @entity18 to release a list of who was briefed about the interrogation programs			1
" @entity131 and the @entity85 people deserve a full and complete set of facts about what information was yielded by @entity99 's interrogation program , and they deserve to know which of their representatives in @entity131 were briefed about these techniques and the extent of those briefings , " @entity125 said in a statement monday			2
" to date , the administration has fallen short in providing this information			0
... the @entity85 people have been provided an incomplete picture of exactly what intelligence was made available by the interrogation program , " he said			2
but @entity150 sen. @entity149 , a @entity151 - turned - independent , said the whole debate over the memos is " moot			2
" " what do we gain , first , by releasing the memos ; but , secondly , what do we gain from indicting lawyers for their opinions , if that is a possibility here ? ... it will poison the water here in @entity0			0
it will make it harder for president @entity2 to do some of the big things he wants to do for the country , " he said .			0
