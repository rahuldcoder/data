-- major league catcher @entity5 has been " found alive , " two days after he was reported kidnapped by gunmen , @entity4 state tv reported friday			1
@entity5 was found by security forces in @entity7 , a mountainous region about 60 miles from the north central @entity4 town where he was last seen , according to a tweet posted late friday by communications minister @entity10			1
@entity5 was reported by state - run @entity11 to be healthy and unharmed			1
@entity5 , a rising star for the @entity12 as a rookie this past year , had returned to his native country to play in @entity4 's winter league			1
but before his first game with the @entity19 , gunmen kidnapped him wednesday night from his mother 's home in @entity22 in @entity23 , a team spokeswoman said			1
on thursday , authorities said that they had found the suv they believe was used in the kidnapping and had created sketches of two of the gunmen			1
prior to his release friday , news about the federal investigation was tightly guarded			0
" it 's understandable that everyone wants to know what is happening with @entity5 and how the investigation goes , but remember that , in these cases , patience is key , " @entity19 spokeswoman @entity33 said on her @entity35 account			1
she added that keeping the details sealed could help the investigation			0
" it has all the earmarks as a targeted kidnapping : selected victim , selected location , selected time , " said @entity45 , a kidnapping specialist for @entity46 who has handled six cases involving @entity4 and who worked for the @entity49 for 26 years			1
" there 's an outside possibility that they thought they were grabbing another member of the family , but that 's extremely unlikely			0
" kidnapping as an industry has crossed the border from @entity65 into @entity4 , @entity45 said			1
" when criminals next door show you a model of how to make money easily -- and kidnapping is usually pretty easy money -- then other kidnappers will simply ape it			0
" but targeting athletes and other celebrities can be a mistake , he said			0
" it 's going to bring too much law enforcement scrutiny down on them ; too much international scrutiny			0
and media attention and scrutiny from law enforcement worldwide is bad for business			0
" @entity5 , 24 , emerged as the @entity12 ' top catcher this past season			1
he had a .267 batting average with 15 home runs and 52 runs batted in			0
though soccer reigns in most @entity94 countries , it is baseball that rules in @entity4 , which routinely feeds players to major league teams in the @entity98			1
that pipeline has been transformed in recent years because of violence			0
as @entity4 's economy has stagnated in recent years , crimes such as kidnapping and murder have risen			1
according to the @entity106 , 16,917 people were kidnapped between july 2008 and july 2010 , or about 23 kidnappings a day			0
baseball players who play professionally in the @entity98 , whether in the major or minor leagues , are typically targeted for their money , though @entity5 ' case is the first time a player himself has been snatched			1
usually , a family member is held for ransom			0
" @entity118 , please do something because @entity4 is crumbling with so much insecurity while you say that @entity4 is safe , " @entity4 baseball player @entity116 wrote on his @entity35 account			1
@entity122 , a @entity4 playing professionally in the @entity98 @entity123 , told @entity0 that there are lots of opportunities in @entity4 , but also pitfalls			1
@entity122 has played for the @entity19 and is a friend and former teammate of @entity5			1
" @entity4 does have one of the best winter leagues , but it is one of the leagues where the @entity98 ask before going because of the insecurity and the dangers that one faces , " he said			2
those dangers have led many @entity94 teams to abandon their baseball academies in @entity4 , said @entity139 , a lawyer and sports columnist who co-authored a book about the recruitment of players from @entity4			2
when major league teams noticed the talent sitting in places like the @entity148 and @entity4 , they increased their investment in the region			2
instead of relying on scouts to find players , they instituted the academies to find , train and sign players , @entity139 said			0
" the goal is to identify the players and sign the players , and if you can do it as cheaply as possible , all the better , " he told @entity0			0
as crime in @entity4 increased , however , operating the academies became dangerous for their managers and scouts			2
" all of a sudden , with these safety issues , teams started to leave , " @entity139 said			0
at its peak , about 16 major league teams operated baseball academies in @entity4 , he said			2
today , that number is only five or six			0
teams have returned to the practice of sending only scouts , and then sending promising players to academies in the @entity148			0
@entity4 who make it to the big leagues in the @entity98 and return home become targets because there is a perception that they all make a lot of money , @entity139 said			2
but for the minor leaguers and nonsuperstars in their first major league years , that is not necessarily the case			0
another aspect that may have influenced the @entity5 kidnapping is that players from humble backgrounds who make money in the pros often return to the rough neighborhoods where their families live			2
working - class families often do n't want to leave their neighborhoods and their friends ; they may feel they do n't belong in middle - and upper - class neighborhoods			2
for example , @entity5 was kidnapped from the home of his relatives , who had stayed in a tough area despite his success .			2

new : he was found by security forces about 60 miles from where he was last seen
