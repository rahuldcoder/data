an era of fumbling for spare change and driving in circles in search for a parking space may be coming to a close			2
drivers across the nation and around the world are turning to mobile apps , websites and other forms of technology to both find and pay for parking with greater efficiency			1
at the same time , major @entity18 cities and a new wave of startups are working to simplify the parking process , perhaps marking a revolution in the parking industry , experts say			1
@entity24 , 24 , lives in the @entity26 neighborhood of @entity27 and knows firsthand about the frustrations of parking in a busy city			2
a former employee at @entity32 , @entity24 found himself driving in circles every time he headed home from work			0
" anyone who has lived in @entity27 or @entity37 or a lot of these densely populated neighborhoods knows that searching for spots can be like looking for a needle in a haystack , " @entity24 said			0
so @entity24 quit his job and founded the app @entity45 , which allows a user who has a parking spot in the @entity26 area to offer it up for a price , usually around $ 3			0
a driver who needs a space pays and then takes the spot to complete the exchange			0
cities across the @entity18 are turning to similar innovative parking technologies			1
just this month , @entity57 's @entity56 announced plans to develop an app , expected to launch in the fall , letting residents pay for parking straight from their smartphones			1
the city of @entity65 , @entity66 , recently initiated a similar pilot program			0
@entity68 partnered with @entity69 and @entity70 in may to launch apps that help drivers find and pay for parking spots			1
and @entity74 will be expanding its pay - by - phone parking service , @entity76 , to all its 36,000 parking meters by the end of the summer after piloting the app since april			1
" what we 're seeing is a demand from our consumers to offer a level of convenience that really heretofore had n't been the hallmark of the parking industry , " said @entity80 , spokesman for the @entity81 , the largest trade association for parking professionals and the parking industry			0
the @entity18 and beyond so why , beyond the growth of mobile payments in general , are these mobile parking apps catching on ? @entity96 , marketing director of the app , website and in - car service @entity99 , attributes the trend to the recent growth of @entity18 urban populations			1
" people are moving back into cities , " @entity96 said , " and they need parking spots			1
" according to the @entity81 's 2013 report , the @entity18 cities leading the way in parking innovation include @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117 , @entity118			1
and although some apps are only available in select @entity18 cities , others have expanded their usage nationally and even internationally			1
@entity70 provides data , availability and payment information for on - and off - street parking in more than 1,800 cities and 32 countries , according to its website			2
and @entity69 , which was developed in 1999 in @entity130 , has since spread to the @entity18 -- where it boasts 2.5 million members -- along with @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , said @entity136 , @entity69 's executive vice president of business development			2
in general , compared to @entity130 , the @entity18 has been a bit slower to adopt the concept of newer parking technologies , @entity136 said			1
parking has historically been more of a challenge in @entity130 where cities are generally more densely populated , but the @entity18 is catching up quickly , he said			1
legal threats this new era of parking enables drivers to save time on the road and reduce the nation 's carbon footprint , experts say			1
it 's also transforming the parking industry , @entity80 said , illustrating a shift from cash - based to mainly electronic payment methods			0
but not everyone is thrilled with the emergence of these apps -- most notably , cities that make money from parking meters and , yes , parking fines			1
@entity112 , for example is experimenting with a pilot project that lets residents feed parking meters through credit , debit and public - transit cards			0
sensors enable people to search for open spaces through a mobile app. @entity112 's city attorney has threatened to sue @entity175 , a startup whose app lets users pass along their parking space for a fee , if they do n't shut down by july 11			2
two other parking startups , @entity182 and @entity183 , will also face similar cease - and - desist demands this week , according to the city attorney 's office			1
the attorney , @entity187 , also sent a copy of his cease - and - desist letter to @entity190 , which makes the app available in its @entity192			0
he argues the apps amount to illegally selling a public commodity			0
supporters say the apps let users share information about parking spaces , not the spaces themselves			1
besides , anyone can already text or call a friend and tell them a space is about to open up , they say			0
convenience and conservation @entity208 , 20 , of @entity209 , @entity66 , uses the @entity211 app when he parks at the train station			0
this way he does n't need to carry spare change , is notified when time on his parking space is running low and can then refill it remotely			2
" my drives to the train station sometimes can cut it really close to where if i had to manually pay for parking , i would have missed my train , " @entity208 said			2
" as long as i check my space number when i 'm running from my car to the train , i can pay for parking while on the train			2
" parking apps like @entity70 and @entity229 also let drivers compare prices of different parking spaces -- and prevent them from building up parking ticket fees			1
that 's what inspired @entity236 to launch @entity229 , a website and app that allows drivers to reserve parking and get discounts in garages in select cities			1
" i had racked up about $ 5,000 in parking tickets , " said @entity236 , co-founder and coo of the company			0
" i realized if i was reserving my parking online , i could be solving my own problems			0
" the other plus side is the environmental impact , experts say			0
the less drivers idle , cruise and search for parking , the less the negative impact on the environment , said @entity257 , @entity70 's director of communications			2
the future of parking the next step in this emerging trend may be in - car services that allow drivers to find and pay for parking spaces			1
" when you 're in your car , that presents a problem because you have to stop , pull over and start typing , or you 're driving and texting , and it 's not legal and it 's dangerous , " said @entity96 of @entity99			0
" when you 're driving around , you do n't want to be late , and you do n't want to have to pull out different apps when you wo n't know which one does what			0
" that 's why companies like @entity99 and @entity69 have partnered with automakers like @entity275 and @entity276 to allow drivers to access parking services , some of which are voice - activated , from inside their vehicles			2
six more similar partnerships are in the works for @entity69 , according to @entity136			0
@entity136 is n't completely sure what is yet to come in terms of parking technology , but he has pondered one possibility : " connected vehicles are a valuable extension , " @entity136 said , " but in the end you could also think about wearables ( such as @entity293 )			0
maybe that will be another ... ( way ) to let you start a parking session			0
