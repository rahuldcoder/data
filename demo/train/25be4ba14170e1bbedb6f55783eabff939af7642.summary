attacked by a shouting mob			2
that 's what happened to @entity5 in the week ending may 16			1
and if you think : " well thank goodness my week was a lot quieter , " think again			2
the attacks on @entity5 were an attack on you too			1
@entity5 is a @entity11 cartoonist			1
in the summer of 2007 , he was invited to submit three drawings to an exhibition sponsored by the town of @entity15			0
the exhibition 's theme : " the dog in art. " @entity5 produced three pencil sketches of street dogs with human faces , the face ( @entity5 said ) of the @entity24			1
even if you do n't know the rest of the story , you can easily imagine			0
in march , police in @entity29 arrested seven people on charges of conspiring to murder @entity5			1
the same day , @entity33 law enforcement announced the indictment of an @entity33 woman who had attempted to recruit assassins to kill @entity5			1
yet @entity5 has refused to be intimidated			1
on tuesday of this week , @entity5 appeared at the @entity37 to lecture on his art and ideas			1
two - hundred - fifty people passed through metal detectors to hear him speak			0
they never got the chance			0
@entity43 opened his talk with a provocative short video that included an image of two nearly naked @entity48 gay men wearing masks of @entity24			1
at that cue , about 20 rowdies in the crowd shouted , " stop the film ! stop the film ! " the rowdies rushed toward the stage			2
one of them apparently struck @entity43			0
police sought to restrain them			0
after eight or so minutes of chanting , yelling and fist - pumping by the rowdies , the university suspended the performance			2
you can watch the incident here in a 10 - minute @entity67 clip			0
the blogger who writes under the pseudonym @entity69 directs attention toward two aspects of the confrontation that might be overlooked in the excitement : the ineffectiveness of the police and the passivity of a crowd of spectators who outnumber the protesters by at least 10 to 1			1
@entity82 life in @entity11 and other @entity84 countries is increasingly governed by an unwritten set of rules very different from the country 's formal law			1
the formal law forbids assault and upholds free speech rights			0
the actual rules of the game , however , concede that certain assaults and certain violations of free speech rights may proceed with impunity			2
police arrested two men for disrupting the @entity101 event ; both were released without charge			0
in the aftermath of the @entity110 incident , @entity107 ' website was hacked and firebombs were planted in his house			0
( two men have been arrested in connection with the firebombing			0
) the authorities look the other way in hope of obtaining social peace			1
this policy does not work , and for two reasons : first , the policy of impunity emboldens aggressive minorities			2
instead of accepting that they must live and let live , these groups get the message they can dominate others by the threat of force			1
but second , the policy of impunity backfires			0
while the authorities want quiet , ornery individuals like @entity5 are delighted to bust taboos and foment the very confrontations the authorities wish to avoid			1
@entity5 is just one of a multiplying band of deliberate provocateurs who have appeared across @entity84 over the past five years			1
their work may not have much artistic merit , but the issue here is not art but courage			0
and there will always be enough courageous people to complicate badly the lives of uncourageous authorities			0
the irony is that these uncourageous authorities would gain much more quiet if they upheld their formal rules			2
when the rules are clear and enforced , almost everybody will conform to them			2
expel one student for disrupting a campus event , and you are unlikely to have to expel a second			0
but when the authorities declare a " moral holiday " ( to update an old phrase from the @entity33 urban riots of the 1960s ) , otherwise law - abiding people seize the opportunity			0
they commit acts of intimidation and violence they would never have dared if law - breaking had been met by immediate sanction and certain punishment			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			1

@entity176 says university attack on cartoonist @entity5 should worry everyone
his talk was provocative , but more *shocking* was the crowd 's passivity as he was assaulted
@entity11 , other @entity84 countries increasingly governed by unwritten rules , he says
@entity188 : *trading* social peace for *unpunished* attacks allows aggressive groups to dominate
