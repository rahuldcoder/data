@entity0 -- politics is full of second chances			2
now @entity6 is hoping to travel the same route in seeking political redemption			1
@entity6 was in his seventh term in @entity10 , representing parts of the @entity13 boroughs of @entity14 and @entity15 , when he resigned from the @entity17 in 2011 amid scandal over lewd photos sent via @entity20			1
@entity6 talked about his controversy in a video that went up online early wednesday where he announced his candidacy for mayor of @entity13			1
" look , i made some big mistakes , and i know i let a lot of people down			2
but i 've also learned some tough lessons			2
i 'm running for mayor because i 've been fighting for the middle class and those struggling my entire life			1
and i hope i get a second chance to work for you			2
" the video also features his wife , @entity37 , a former top adviser to @entity39 , and their young son			2
later in the video , @entity37 says " we love this city , and no one will work harder to make it better than @entity6			1
" sound familiar ? flash back a few months to @entity4 , another well - known politician looking for a second chance			0
@entity4 's political career was left for dead following an infamous affair , but he made a bid for political redemption , running in a special election to fill a vacant congressional seat			2
@entity4 succeeded in his comeback by winning this month 's election and is again representing @entity57 's 1st @entity56 , a seat he once held before he became governor			0
@entity4 talked about his affair in his first campaign commercial			0
most special elections for a vacant @entity17 seat do n't grab national attention , but thanks to @entity4 ( and his @entity68 opponent being the sister of @entity71 host @entity70 ) , the race was in the headlines			0
the media loves a comeback story , if only because it allows them an opportunity to revisit what brought down that politician in the first place			0
so @entity6 , like @entity4 , will be in the spotlight , for better or for worse			1
" voters love a good comeback story			0
we identify with the underdog and cheer for him as we would for ourselves , " says @entity84 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity85			0
" but voters also love justice			0
we want people to pay for their mistakes			0
@entity6 has n't yet paid for his			1
he probably will in this election			0
but who knows ? " " @entity6 was of the most talented politicians in either party , and this race is going to be steep climb for any of the candidates			1
@entity6 definitely has a shot , " says a @entity68 strategist who 's worked in @entity13 politics			1
" when you have someone as skillful as a messenger as @entity6 , that makes a big difference in a race where tv ad spending is limited due to @entity13 election laws and the fact that it 's the most expensive media market in county , " adds the strategist , who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely			1
the big question is what the voters think			0
as of now , nearly half of @entity13 voters do n't think @entity6 should run for mayor this year , according to a new poll			1
according to a @entity123 survey , which was conducted in the week before @entity6 's announcement and released wednesday , 49 % of @entity13 voters said @entity6 should not run for mayor , with 38 % saying he should make a bid and 12 % unsure			1
the 49 % figure is up five percentage points from a @entity123 poll conducted in mid-april			0
the survey indicates @entity68 voters are divided , with 41 % saying @entity6 should run and 44 % disagreeing			1
but @entity6 's entry into the race finds him in the second spot for his party 's nomination , according to the poll , with 15 % of registered @entity68 saying they would vote for @entity6 if the primary were held today			1
city council speaker @entity139 remains in the top spot , at 25 %			0
@entity141 has long been the @entity68 front - runner in the race , and if she 's elected in the november general election , she 'll become @entity146 's first female and first openly gay mayor			2
the other @entity68 candidates are at 10 % or less in the survey , with more than a quarter of voters undecided			0
the poll also indicates that at this stage in the campaign , the eventual @entity68 nominee would be the front - runner in the november election .			0
