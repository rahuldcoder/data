@entity0 -- if somebody pulled out a gun on a crowded train you were riding on , would you notice ? these people did n't			1
why ? they were too into their smartphones , a @entity0 prosecutor says			1
the september killing of 20 - year - old @entity11 on that busy train was shocking enough			1
the shooter , apparently picking the victim at random , shot the @entity16 student in the back			1
also shocking , the prosecutor says , was the initial actions of bystanders			1
800 texts in one week ? diaries of 3 smartphone addicts " some are no more than two to three feet to him , " said @entity0 district attorney @entity25 " we 're seeing people that are so disconnected to their surroundings			1
people are being robbed , people are being hurt , people are being run over by cars because they 're so disconnected because of these phones			2
" a suspect has been arrested for the killing and pleaded not guilty , authorities said			2
but the phenomenon of witnesses being distracted by technology may continue , @entity25 said			2
" just for our own safety , would n't you want to know if somebody standing next to you is pulling a gun out ? i think i would , " @entity25 said			1
the security footage of the incident is chilling			2
the man , donning a baseball hat and smile , lifts a .45 - caliber handgun in plain view , three or four times			2
@entity57 waves the weapon as if choosing who he wants to kill			0
at one point , he even wipes his nose with the gun			1
but nobody seemed to notice until the blast goes off			0
though this is an extreme and violent example , there are others			0
you may remember the woman who was so absorbed with texting that she fell right into a mall fountain			0
or you remember the guy who was so engrossed in his phone he almost walks right into a black bear			0
but those were just harmless viral videos that many have laughed at			0
this is different , especially for @entity16 students			0
" that 's just people 's stupidity , i guess , ignorance of what 's happening around them , " said @entity78			0
and there is no sign that this will end			0
the other day at the same train stop where @entity11 boarded for the last time , a group of college students milled around , most of them too focused on their phones to notice a @entity1 camera focused on them			1
