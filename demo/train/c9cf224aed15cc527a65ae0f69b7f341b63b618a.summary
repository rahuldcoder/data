-- @entity1 and @entity2 may not always see eye - to - eye , but they have at least one trait in common : the inability to be cool			1
as @entity1 explains in the december issue of @entity8 , " being cool is about keeping your blood pressure steady , " rather than being passionate			1
similar to @entity11 , @entity1 is n't the type of guy who can restrain himself from displaying passion , whether he 's passionately in love with something or passionately in disagreement -- particularly when he 's in disagreement with his critics			1
after surviving a stretch of negative reactions to his entertainment offerings this fall -- there was september 's " @entity25 , " and his october release with @entity27 , " @entity28 " -- @entity1 admits to @entity8 that it was " literally like a bunch of people just took a s * * * on my face			1
" to make matters worse , the crime drama " @entity28 " was not only poorly reviewed , but it also did n't do well at the box office			2
( to date , it 's made $ 19.2 million domestically			1
) so when reviewers told the 32 - year - old that he should reconsider this whole acting thing , and probably should have also re-thought releasing the second half of march 's " the 20/20 experience , " @entity1 was feeling a little sensitive			1
" this face ... this recognizable face that you work so hard to get -- not because you want the recognition but because you know you 're made to do it " also comes with a price , he said			2
" the movie did n't do well at the box office , so i should quit ? hold on a second			1
if i was somebody else , you would n't have said that			0
i have the number one album this week , and i should n't have released it ? come on , man			1
you sound like a d * * * head ...			0
it just shocked me because , like , you 're trade magazines			0
none of your opinions count			0
and by the way , none of you can do it			0
" although @entity1 has been in the business since he was a child , getting his start in entertainment around age 10 and building his fanbase on " the @entity73 , " he nonetheless " grew up with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder , " he says			1
" sometimes i find it funny that i 've been able to acquire the patience it takes to be kind to people in our business			0
because sometimes i just want to f * * * * g kill everybody			0
" so , no. @entity1 is n't always as cool and smooth as his " @entity81 " portray him to be			1
but the actor / singer / entrepreneur -- who later apologized for going off on that " tangent " during the interview -- does n't have any regrets			0
" i 've been doing this professionally since i was 10			0
if entertainment years were dog years , man , i 'd be like @entity90			0
i 'd be like 250 years old , " the recently married star says			0
" do n't be cool			2
... i 've made a career out of doing things that i should not be doing			0
i was n't cool about it			2
because being cool would have meant i passed up on those opportunities			2
if you do that , it 's because you 're afraid			2
and what are you afraid of ? you know ? " the full interview is in the december issue of @entity8 , which has named @entity1 one of its @entity105 , along with rapper @entity107 , " anchorman " star @entity108 , @entity110 and the late @entity111 .			1
