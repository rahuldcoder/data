an @entity1 jury on thursday found former @entity3 - area police sergeant @entity2 guilty of murder in the 2004 death of his ex-wife			1
the jury of seven men and five women deliberated for nearly 14 hours total before delivering its verdict convicting @entity2 in the death of his third wife , @entity12			1
" finally somebody heard @entity12 's cry , " her mother , @entity13 , told reporters after the verdict			1
" twelve people did the right thing , oh thank @entity21			0
" @entity22 was found dead in her dry , clean bathtub on march 1 , 2004			2
while prosecutors claimed @entity2 killed @entity22 , the defense contended that she fell , hit her head and drowned			1
the headline - grabbing case did not arise until after @entity2 's fourth wife , @entity30 , disappeared in october 2007			1
it was during the search for @entity33 -- who has not been found -- that investigators said they would look again into @entity22 's death , which was initially ruled an accidental drowning			1
in february 2008 , authorities altered their judgment and ruled @entity22 's death a homicide			1
@entity2 was later arrested and charged with first - degree murder			2
@entity2 was married to @entity22 in 2001 when he had an affair with then - 17 - year - old @entity42 , who later became his fourth wife			1
@entity22 and @entity2 filed for divorce in october 2001 and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years			1
@entity47 , @entity1 , police records indicate officers were called to @entity22 's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004			1
@entity2 had @entity22 arrested twice for domestic violence , though she was found not guilty in both cases			2
on february 27 , 2004 , @entity2 picked up his two sons from @entity22 's home and spent the next two days with them			1
prosecutors said he entered her home again early on february 29 and killed her			0
at the time of her death , a court was mulling how the couple 's marital assets would be divided , and @entity22 was set to receive part of @entity2 's pension and other support			1
" we have left - front injuries , left - side injuries , left - back injuries , right injuries , right and left injuries , " prosecutor @entity69 said in his closing argument , disputing the defense assertion @entity22 's death was an accident			1
" so it 's not just one side of her body ; it 's multiple sides , four sides			0
" how can you get that in one fall ? you ca n't			0
you ca n't do it			0
" the jury released a statement , read outside the @entity95 courthouse by @entity97 deputy @entity96 , in which they thanked the judge , bailiffs and sheriff 's office and said they took their responsibility seriously			0
" we have reached a decision we believe is just , " the jurors said			0
the more - than - monthlong trial was marked by repeated missteps by the prosecution that angered judge @entity107 and the defense			0
at least four times , prosecutors allowed witnesses to testify to details @entity107 had told them not to go into -- such as whether @entity22 had a protective order against her husband or allowing a witness to demonstrate climbing into a bathtub			0
in some cases the defense sought a mistrial and in others they asked the judge to strike entire testimony			0
@entity107 instead ordered the jury to disregard elements of the testimony that went against his orders			0
" the disrespect to the court is shocking , " @entity107 told the prosecution last week			0
on thursday , @entity130 state 's attorney @entity129 expressed confidence the conviction , which he called " very sobering , " will stand up against appeal			2
" we took him on and we won , " he said of @entity2 , whom he called " a coward and a bully			0
" " this defendant brutally killed @entity12			0
" @entity140 : critical moments in the @entity2 trial after thursday 's verdict , @entity2 's defense team stood by their client and promised to continue their fight on his behalf			1
lawyer @entity150 contended there was a large amount of bias against @entity2 before the trial even began			0
" he is absolutely innocent , " @entity150 said of @entity2 , claiming the prosecution 's case " was based almost entirely on hearsay			1
" he called @entity22 's death " a household accident			1
" the @entity22 family , though , did n't hide their contempt for what the victim 's brother , @entity163 , called @entity2 's " clown defense team who made fun of this whole trial			1
" @entity22 called thursday 's verdict " bittersweet , " describing the jury 's decision as " fantastic " while also lamenting it would n't bring back his sister			2
he added that his family wants @entity2 to next be held responsible for whatever happened to @entity33			2
" although we can not have @entity12 back , we hope she can now rest in peace and that she knows she has had her day , " @entity22 said , reading out a statement from family			2
" she will be missed and remembered in our hearts always			0
" @entity30 , you are now next for justice			0
" @entity183 , @entity33 's sister , said she hopes the verdict will spur someone to come forward " who knows something about my sister , ( because ) they feel safe to talk now			2
" while she says she is still trying to process the import of the jury 's decision , @entity42 said one thought went through her mind immediately after hearing it : " game over , @entity2			2
" @entity140 : @entity2 trial @entity197			0

a top prosecutor says he 's confident the conviction will stand up against appeal
@entity2 's lawyers say their client is innocent and blast the prosecution 's case
authorities *re-examined* @entity12 's death after @entity33 went missing
