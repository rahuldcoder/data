-- a helicopter runs out of fuel midair after its pilot was evidently flying with one hand and texting with another			2
the chopper crashes , killing everyone on board			2
it sounds incredible , but it 's true			0
we live in a multitasking society			0
now some experts wonder whether that reality is clashing with the safe operation of our nation 's aircraft			0
distraction in the cockpit was a key element of testimony delivered tuesday on a deadly 2011 medivac helicopter crash			1
the pilot was violating @entity25 rules and company policy by using his phone in flight			1
yet in some cases , the use of other types of personal electronic devices in the cockpit is still allowed			1
read details from the @entity36 accident investigation ( pdf ) but that may be changing			0
experts and officials say a total ban on using personal electronic devices in the cockpit is needed			1
" you ca n't multitask everything , " said @entity43 , a former member of the @entity36 , which is the nation 's top aviation investigation agency			0
" to think that you can text and fly , especially a helicopter , is ludicrous			2
helicopters require concentration , even more so than many airplanes			0
" @entity54 chopper pilots fall under the same rules for electronic communications devices as commercial airplanes			1
@entity43 and other experts favor stricter @entity25 rules for all aircraft , including helicopter ambulances			1
under a newly proposed @entity25 rule , commercial pilots would be banned at all times from using " a wireless communications device or laptop computer for personal use while at their duty station on the flight deck while the aircraft is being operated			1
" nonflight related conversations , including via electronic devices , are banned during take off and landing and during flight below 10,000 feet			1
above 10,000 feet , commercial pilots can use tablets and laptops			1
yet laptop distractions were blamed in an embarrassing 2009 incident where @entity82 pilots overshot their destination by 150 miles			0
the @entity25 cited that blunder as a factor in its january proposal to toughen the current rules , which have n't been updated since 1981			1
laptops and tablet computers such as @entity90 have been around for years			0
the @entity82 incident happened in 2009 , so why is the @entity25 only now getting around to stiffening the rules ? " the @entity25 is behind the curve across the board , " said @entity43			1
" the rule making process has become so cumbersome that even when there 's a strong desire to change the rules , it still takes forever			1
" when tougher rules might go into effect is uncertain , the @entity25 said			1
the agency says it is reviewing comments on their proposal			0
it 's a challenging time for the @entity25 to respond quickly to rapidly changing technology , said former @entity107 inspector general @entity106			2
" it 's kind of a learning phase ... a work in progress really			0
" she said the @entity25 has been hampered recently by less than ideal congressional leadership on aviation issues			2
the @entity25 points out that its longstanding policy has always prohibited " during a critical phase of flight " any activity that would distract from the safe operation of an aircraft			2
even if personal electronic devices are banned during flight , pilots often use text - based systems to communicate with controllers on the ground			1
the difference is in situational awareness			0
using technology that folds into flight operations is directly connected to the job at hand			0
making dinner plans is not			0
pilots follow an approved @entity25 process			2
" one pilot tells the other that he 's going heads down for a minute , " @entity43 explained			0
" that 's his signal that the other pilot has to pay more attention			0
" when it comes to single pilots flying alone , operating heads - down technology is supposed to be very limited , @entity43 said , but it 's still a problem that the @entity25 needs to address .			2

@entity147 factored into deadly medivac helicopter crash
@entity25 considering tougher rules on personal electronic devices in the cockpit
some personal use is permitted above 10,000 feet
critics say @entity25 takes too long to change policies
