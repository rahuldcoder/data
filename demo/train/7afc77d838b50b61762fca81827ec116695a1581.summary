-- arriving in central @entity2 from the sparkling international airport , a visitor might not know at first glance that much of the city is under water			1
shops and restaurants are open as usual , while the futuristic sky train continues to ferry commuters to work in the numerous office complexes that make up the central business district			2
but just a few miles northwards along the @entity16 highway , the road gradually disappears into a sea of filthy brown water -- floodwater from the north of @entity21 that shows little sign of disappearing quickly			1
this is due in large part to a system of floodgates set up to protect the commercial center of the city and other key industrial areas by diverting the run - off to these parts			1
for almost a month , residents in outlying areas such as @entity16 and @entity34 have been living in water that is often chest - high			1
many defied government evacuation orders to protect their property , even if it meant being stranded with limited food and no clean running water			1
read predictions that flooding would remain for weeks @entity42 , a local businessman , lost his house and is battling to save his factory , but he still manages to take a boat out each day with his friend @entity46 and cousin @entity47 to distribute water , food and clothes to those in need			1
from his factory office in @entity56 , supplies donated by friends and family are sorted into rescue packs for men , women and children , while the factory workers man an array of water pumps -- some of them cannibalized swimming pool pumps -- around the clock , praying that the defensive wall they erected around the warehouse does n't collapse			1
they are literally under siege from the water			1
yet @entity42 is concerned about the 10 families around the corner who have been forced to set up camp on the upper floors of a dilapidated industrial building nearby			1
watch @entity42 visiting families in a @entity56 warehouse riding in the fully - laden dinghy across what was once the factory 's car park , he explains what spurred him into action			1
" for the first few days after the floods we went about our business dealing with the factory			1
but soon we could n't bear to see people suffering			1
" he says the government is not helping these people , while aid agencies are nowhere to be seen around these flood - hit streets			1
" i saw one boat with around 10 packs of food , but there are thousands of people here , " he said			1
on tuesday , prime minister @entity99 laid out a three - point recovery plan , including immediate aid to those whose homes and businesses have been destroyed			2
meanwhile , relief workers have been distributing aid to evacuation centers but face difficulties reaching residents who have decided to wait out the crisis in their homes			1
as we unload the supplies of eggs , fruit , rice and medicine at our destination , the conditions the families are living in is humbling			1
on the ground floor , children play in the same stagnant water that dogs defecate in , while the adults gather in their damp makeshift sleeping areas with what little they could salvage from their homes			1
however , the atmosphere is not depressing , especially since a year - old baby has taken his first steps in this unlikely setting			2
@entity42 points out that @entity131 never complain and always have a smile on their faces			0
he contends this is because there is no expectation that anyone will be there to help them			0
@entity141 and friends boat down a road in @entity56 as the boat pushes off to find more people to help , we 're immediately surrounded by people			1
some are asking if we have water , while others are looking for diapers			2
no one seems greedy or aggressive			0
they paddle around in anything that will float , from polystyrene blocks to an old refrigerator , while small children swim about in " life jackets " made from empty plastic bottles strung together and stuffed into pieces of clothing			0
this , @entity46 says , is evidence of the @entity21 ability to improvise and adapt in adversity			1
@entity165 : see how you can help an internet security consultant , @entity46 frequently has to field calls from clients on the boat			0
he says he even dropped his iphone into the water during one call and could not find it for five minutes			2
he eventually fished it out , and it continues to work			0
after passing a partially submerged @entity178 drive - thru and a golf course which now resembles a @entity181 - style swamp , we spend time feeding countless abandoned dogs and cats -- a reminder of how quickly some people were forced to leave their homes			1
@entity42 points out that one dog had been tied to the same railing for over a week			0
the obvious buildup of garbage , both in and around the water , has raised fears about the spread of disease			2
according to the country 's @entity196 , some 20,700 kits have been distributed that test for leptospirosis , a severe bacterial infection that can affect areas where water has been stagnant for more than three weeks			1
@entity42 says he made sure his workers have had tetanus shots			0
while most businesses around @entity56 and @entity207 -- including the domestic @entity209 airport -- have been forced to close , the local hospital has remained open for emergency cases only -- provided patients can negotiate the improvised jetty and barking dogs at what was the emergency room entrance			0
the er has been completely destroyed , but a functioning triage unit has been set up on the first floor among piles of dental chairs rescued from another flooded wing			0
the staff -- doctors , nurses and administrators -- have all been living in the hospital since the crisis began			2
" we are coping , " says the friendly receptionist without a hint of dissent			0
back on the highway - turned - river , the boat makes several stops to help people struggling to paddle or wade their way through chest - high water -- including a woman pushing a five - month baby in a kitchen basin , as she searched for diapers -- before we reach the house of @entity42 's father on an affluent street			1
the street signs are almost all under water here , indicating a depth of at least two meters			2
we take our own measurement : 2.20 meters			0
when we reach the house , dark green tide marks on the outer walls illustrate how the water had recently neared 2.5 meters			2
the ground floor is a disaster , as pieces of furniture float freely around what was the lounge			0
" i 'm still smiling , " @entity42 's father says through gritted teeth			0
his son can barely recognize the house he grew up in			0
the smell of stagnant water is also overpowering , while mold is starting to appear on the upper floors , thanks to the " cooking " of the water below in mid-afternoon heat			2
there 's no electricity to power a fan or air - conditioning unit			0
two blocks away , @entity42 's own house has not fared any better			0
a car roof can just be seen in the drive			0
@entity42 's father , who moved from @entity276 to @entity21 more than 30 years ago , thinks it will be months before the water will be gone			1
" but where will the water go ? " he asks			2
" i ca n't see central @entity2 avoiding this			0
" by now it 's almost pitch - black , with almost no street lamps working			0
the water is so congested with other boats -- some carrying cars -- that it takes us an hour to reach dry land			2
the changing depth is also a major hazard , as the propeller on the boat occasionally smashes against concrete			0
another hour - long journey in a car this time , and i 'm back in central @entity2			0
commuters are heading home , and bars and restaurants are open			0
it 's a different city .			0
