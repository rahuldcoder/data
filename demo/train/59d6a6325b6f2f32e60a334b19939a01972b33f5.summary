when @entity1 thinks about the days after @entity2 in 2007 , it 's mostly a blur with a few focused , unavoidable truths			1
her dad , @entity6 , and big brother , @entity7 , had dropped her grandmother at home			2
as father and son headed back to @entity13 , a @entity10 crossed into the southbound lane and struck the @entity17 ' @entity16 minivan head - on			2
the suv driver was drunk , a repeat offender			2
her dad and brother died before rescue workers arrived			2
" i was totally naive to drunk driving and the dangers of alcohol , " said @entity1 , now 17			0
" i did n't know how to deal with it			0
nobody knew how to deal with it			0
" years later , her story precedes her in the high school hallways			1
she thinks she 'll always be known as the girl whose family was killed by a drunken driver			0
she 'd always thought of herself as shy , but the worst moments of her life have become a reason to speak up			0
she 's talked about her father and brother in courtrooms , and to convicted drunken drivers			1
she spoke this year at the national conference of @entity42			1
perhaps most importantly , she 's talks about it at school , to teens , to anybody her age who will listen			1
she believes talking about it prevents more accidents and helps her heal			0
" i remind my friends that no matter what , drinking and driving is not ok			0
there 's no dumber decision you can make , " she said			1
even in high school , where everybody feels invincible , where she knows people party with beer , " i 've had people come up to me and thank me , " she said			0
they 're exactly the conversations advocates against underage drinking and drunken driving want to happen more			0
after all the laws , stats and warnings , they 're learning that peers and parents are among the most powerful influences on whether teens drink alcohol			1
a report released last week by the @entity78 showed the number of teens who drink and drive dropped by 54 % in the last 20 years			1
ninety percent of high school students surveyed said they do n't drink and drive at all			1
for all the improvement , the @entity78 estimated that high school teens still drank alcohol and drove 2.4 million times every month in 2011			1
and young drivers are 17 times more likely to die in a crash when there 's alcohol involved			1
" because of that heightened risk , we can never be complacent , " said @entity90 , a director at the @entity91			0
putting a face on the warnings and statistics can help , he said			1
" i testified probably 50 times to state legislatures about different interventions you could do to reduce the problems , " @entity90 said			0
" i 'm not nearly as effective with the data alone as when people come and tell stories			0
it 's people , not just numbers			1
" in 2008 , @entity108 members began to take a closer look at the research about what would really stop kids from drinking , and from driving afterward			0
they 'd successfully advocated for graduated licenses for new drivers and zero - tolerance laws for drivers younger than 21 with alcohol in their systems and needed a next step			0
" over many years , we were doing what sounded like it would work			1
some of it did work , " @entity125 president @entity124 said			0
@entity129 helped them realize schools assemblies did n't sway teens as much as a conversation with their parents , or an exchange with a classmate			1
they 're trying to get kids and parents to rethink how they talk to each other about alcohol , no matter how awkward it might feel			2
" parents believe the peer pressure is so great that they do n't have as much influence on their teens as they actually do , " @entity124 said			1
empower them , and " it moves into the power of community -- students and adults work together			1
" others around the country are coming to the same conclusion			0
in @entity155 , @entity154 asks people younger than 21 to promise publicly they wo n't drink or get in a car with someone who has			2
the program was was founded by @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 , a 2012 @entity164 @entity163			1
@entity162 's 14 - year - old daughter , @entity165 , was killed in 2007 when an underage drunken driver ran into her as she walked along the sidewalk a block from her house			1
@entity160 's and @entity161 's daughters were injured , too			2
" if you stick with me for four years , " @entity162 told the crowd during @entity165 's eulogy , " do n't use alcohol , do n't use illicit drugs but give back to your community , work with your parents and talk to your parents , i 'll be there with a bunch of other people to give you money			1
" since then , more than 140 high school graduates in different communities around the country have gotten $ 1,000 scholarships from the program			2
at @entity1 's high school in @entity13 , she launched a chapter of @entity191 that now boasts about 30 members			2
she was also among the first to join @entity42 and @entity195 's @entity194 ( th ) @entity193 this year			1
the whole idea : no matter the stats , keep talking about drunken driving			0
later this month , during @entity42 's annual high school @entity200 , the group will distribute a new guide for teens , written with guidance from @entity1 and other young people			1
it reminds students that the majority of teens do n't drink , and even fewer binge drink ; that teens react differently to alcohol than adults ; that there could be major legal consequences to drinking			1
it offers ideas about talking to parents , and resources to call if a family member has a drinking problem			2
" we 're doing everything we can to empower youth to make sure they know they have influence over their own lives , " @entity124 said			0
" we still want to be constantly talking about the issue			0
" @entity124 , after all , has her own story			0
when her kids were growing up in @entity233 , they were never allowed to drink at home or to join their friends for @entity237 getaways some saw as a rite of passage			2
they 'd all signed contracts that said they would n't drink and drive and promised to call if they needed a ride			1
one night in 1992 , her 15 - year - old daughter , @entity243 , spent the night at a friend 's house			2
the girls went out with another group of friends			0
the driver had been drinking			0
looking back , @entity124 said , she thought she 'd talked to her kids about drinking and driving			0
now she knows it was n't often enough			0
" i had the attitude that ' they know how i feel about it , ' " @entity124 said			0
" i believe she had some of the tools -- she certainly did n't drink that night			1
" but still @entity243 got in the car			0

@entity78 : the number of teens who drink and drive has *plummeted* 54 % in 20 years
but every month , millions of them still do it -- and the results are often tragic
@entity42 *leaders* say it 's parents , peers that *resonate* with teens , not statistics
@entity164 @entity163 @entity162 gives scholarships to students who pledge not to drink
