-- the word on the street tonight is that @entity3 is toying with the idea of a much larger screen for the @entity6			1
other @entity6 rumors include a slide - out keyboard and a more competitive camera			1
these rumors may have been spawned by glimpses of as - yet unfinished prototypes which may never come to market ; they could be complete fiction			1
or they could also represent part of the future of @entity3 's iconic phone			0
the bulk of this @entity6 5 - related gossip comes from a @entity21 blog with a high rate of accuracy on previous @entity3 leaks			1
the screen - size rumor comes from @entity26			2
the interesting thing about all these rumors is that each one suggests @entity3 is more concerned than ever about competing with @entity31 devices , many of which feature huge screens , massive cameras and physical keyboards already			2
for example , many top - of - the - line @entity31 models feature 8 - megapixel cameras in contrast to the @entity43 's 5 - megapixel model			1
a couple devices in non- @entity46 markets even top that spec ; the @entity48 features a 14 - megapixel camera			1
without question , the trend is toward more megapixels with every passing month			0
and some of these @entity31 devices feature screens as large as 4.3 inches			0
android devices with screens in the 4 - inches - and - over category often sport kickstands and are lauded for their multimedia capabilities -- or derided for being slightly impractical and unwieldy , depending on the user 's perspective			2
@entity0 : @entity61 2 rumored to have sd card slot now , the @entity6 is rumored to have a camera between 8 megapixels ( competitive with current @entity31 phones ) and 12 megapixels ( blowing most current @entity31 models out of the water and likely keeping pace with future @entity68 , too )			1
with a better camera and a larger screen , it might sport the specs to intrigue those whose loyalties lie with the best hardware over the brand name			0
the physical keyboard rumor , however , is a horse of a different color			0
a handful of @entity31 and @entity82 devices have been holding sway over the business and content - creating crowd with their Ã¼ber - efficient text entry			0
but the enterprise is n't a market @entity3 has typically courted in the past ; to do so now , we suspect they 'd have to have a virtual keyboard option alongside a physical keyboard option -- an extremely atypical move for the company			0
which of these rumors -- if any -- do you think are true ? give us your opinion in the comments			0
