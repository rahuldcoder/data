-- upgrading to the new @entity2 operating system is not nearly as complicated as it looks , despite @entity5 's sometimes muddled marketing			1
getting used to using it is a different story			0
at midnight thursday , @entity5 's newest operating system is finally on sale			1
with more than a billion users , @entity5 's @entity10 is the dominant pc platform in the world			1
this launch is a big moment for the company , which is trying to keep those users from leaving for more mobile friendly competitors			2
@entity19 : @entity2 -- @entity5 's biggest gamble here are the basics for regular , non-techy @entity10 users curious about getting started with @entity2			1
what is @entity2 ? @entity2 is @entity5 's latest operating system			1
it features touchscreen capabilities and a drastically different interface , and runs on tablets as well as pcs. it can be controlled entirely by touch ( on compatible devices ) , with a mouse and keyboard , or by any combination of your preferred input options			1
the operating system is a daring effort by @entity5 to stay relevant as pcs are being overtaken by mobile devices			1
@entity41 's @entity40 and @entity44 's @entity43 operating systems are dominating the tablet and smartphone market , and @entity5 is attempting something big , different and risky to catch up			2
this is @entity5 's first operating system since the well - received @entity49 was released three years ago			1
it is a complete reimagining of the desktop computer interface , but it is built on the same base as @entity49 , so all your old applications should continue to work just fine			1
( except on devices running @entity56 more on that later			0
) what 's different in this operating system ? the biggest change in @entity2 is a system - wide shift in attitude			1
@entity41 products have the reputation for being fun and creative , @entity10 pcs for being dull but hardworking			1
one brand screams " @entity71 , " the other @entity70 spreadsheets			0
@entity5 wants @entity10 to be hip and enjoyable to use , so it has come up with its own tablet - style interface and tried to make it work on tablets as well as @entity27 at its best , the result adds some much needed life to an all - work - and - no - play operating system			1
at its worst , windows 8 feels like two creatures hastily thrown together , @entity80			0
one interface feels better with a touchscreen and gestures , the other with a keyboard and mouse or touchpad			2
the familiar desktop view has been pushed to the background to make room for a colorful , touchable , swipeable @entity91 , which acts as your home base			0
when you start the computer , you 'll be greeted with a jazzy array of square and rectangle tiles representing applications , arranged into groups			2
the tiles can show live information such as your latest e-mail , breaking news , photos , the weather or calendar reminders			0
this side of @entity2 runs apps developed for and sold in the @entity109			2
but you can also click on a traditional @entity10 application and it will open it in the desktop view			2
@entity2 review : a big , beautiful , slightly shaky step forward back on the old desktop view , the most visible change is that the start button is gone			2
all your old applications look and feel the same in this retro world , though tapping on buttons designed for a mouse can be tricky			0
if you get confused , and you will in the beginning , one swipe from the right side of the @entity128 brings up a search tool to help you track down files or applications			0
some @entity10 users will scoff at the attempts to liven up the old system as pandering to more casual computer users , or as somehow making the system less capable of serious work			1
but there are also many subtle , under - the - hood changes , including performance improvements			0
most notably , the startup time is greatly improved over @entity49			0
there also is a new feature called @entity145 that makes it easy to manage your various storage and backup options			0
who should update to @entity2 ? the first version of a new operating system is bound to have bugs and issues			1
individual @entity10 users , especially those with just one machine who depend on it for work or school , should not rush right out for that upgrade			1
wait until a more stable version comes along that irons out early problems			0
if you have an non-touchscreen computer , the switch may not be worth it unless you need the under - the - hood improvements			2
the operating system works on regular computers that do n't have touchscreens , but they miss the best parts of the experience			1
the @entity128 and new tiled interface are n't nearly as satisfying when you can only click on them with a mouse ( a touchpad is slightly better )			2
if you are a diehard @entity10 fan , or just a tech - savvy computer user familiar with the perils of being an early adopter , you 'll just need to make sure your current computer meets the system requirements			1
if you want to buy a new computer , there are already a large number of touchscreen options pre-loaded with @entity2 from major manufacturers , including @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194			1
there are ultrabooks , tablets , hybrids and desktops at all prices			2
there is plenty of hardware available at launch , but the @entity109 software selection is still a bit sparse			0
corporate users are usually slower to upgrade their workforces to a new operating system , and without a compelling reason to switch to @entity2 , that will likely be the case this time as well			1
a recent report from technology research firm @entity214 predicts 90 % of enterprises will wait to upgrade to @entity2 until 2015			1
companies that depend heavily on mobile devices might be the exception			0
which version of @entity10 should i get ? there are four versions of the new @entity10 operating system : @entity10 8 , @entity224 , and @entity56 and @entity225			1
while that may seem like a lot , it 's actually fewer versions than @entity10 has offered for its operating systems in the past			1
luckily , the decision of which to buy is pretty much made for you			2
if you are an individual upgrading an existing computer , your only option at the moment is @entity238 the basic consumer version of @entity2 will not be available for standalone purchase until february 2 , 2013			1
for now , @entity56 and the basic version of @entity2 are only available pre-installed on new computers			1
the differences between @entity2 and @entity224 are minor			2
the big decision you 'll have to make when buying a new system is if you want a @entity2 or @entity56 device			1
@entity56 is a different version created for devices with @entity249 processers			0
these processers , typically found in phones and tablets , use less power , which means longer battery life			0
at the moment , @entity56 is only available pre-installed on @entity5 's new surface tablet and a handful of other devices			0
@entity19 : in @entity2 , the @entity259 has its first real challenger @entity56 and @entity2 look the same , but there 's one key difference : @entity56 will not run your old @entity10 applications , only applications available through the @entity109			1
that means no downloading any third - party apps from the @entity267			0
the @entity109 has 5,000 apps in stock , but that number should grow over time			0
this closed approach is similar to the @entity259 and @entity272 , which can only run applications sold through @entity41 's @entity274			0
finally , are you a large company planning on buying a large number of licenses ? if yes , check out @entity278			0
is @entity10 8 difficult to learn ? windows 8 presents a completely new approach to using a @entity10 computer , and as with anything radically new , it takes some getting used to			1
do not upgrade unless you can spare some time to familiarize yourself with the layout and settings			0
the new look borrows heavily from the @entity40 and @entity43 mobile operating systems , but is n't nearly as intuitive			0
before you get scared off , know that it 's not that hard to figure out the new system			0
it just takes a bit of effort and time , like learning any new program would			0
@entity5 took a big leap and created something new			0
getting acclimatized is just a natural part of the process			0
some stores selling the @entity2 products are offering classes			2
@entity303 , for example , will have free personalized training on the new system , as well as help moving old data over to a new computer			2
how much does it cost ? @entity5 is dropping the $ 200 price of @entity224 for its big debut			0
existing @entity49 , @entity312 and @entity313 ( with @entity314 ) users can upgrade to @entity224 for $ 40 online			1
if you 'd prefer a physical copy shipped to you in a nice box , the price goes up to $ 70			2
the deal is good through the end of january .			0

the new @entity2 operating system is available after midnight thursday
it can be downloaded online , shipped or you can buy a new computer with it pre-installed
the new interface , which is for tablets and pcs , is fun but takes some getting used to
existing @entity10 users can upgrade for $ 40 online
