-- an @entity2 administration initiative that aims to create jobs and economic growth has been derailed in some states while it speeds along in others			0
the loss of a total of $ 1.2 billion in high - speed rail funds in @entity10 and @entity11 means the promise of thousands of new jobs in those states will not be realized , according to proponents of the fast passenger trains			1
the @entity2 administration wants to use large - scale infrastructure projects like high - speed rail to boost the economy much in the way that public works projects put people back to work during the @entity25			1
mayor @entity26 was hoping a high - speed line that was planned to go through @entity28 , @entity10 , would spur development of retail and apartments in his town of about 23,000			1
but some newly elected officials have put the brakes on those plans , raising questions about whether it 's still possible to build big in the @entity38			2
citing two incoming governors ' opposition to high - speed rail projects in the @entity43 , transportation secretary @entity39 redirected $ 810 million away from @entity10 and $ 400 million from @entity11 to other states			1
@entity45 is getting the lion 's share , $ 624 million for its link between @entity48 and @entity49			2
$ 342 million is going to @entity50 with the remainder divided among @entity52 and 10 other states			0
is the @entity38 turning a corner on high - speed rail ? along with the money comes jobs			1
in @entity10 , the outgoing governor @entity58 claimed over 4,700 jobs directly related to the high - speed rail line between @entity61 and @entity62 would have been realized at the height of construction			1
proponents claimed thousands of indirect jobs would have been created as a result of the projected economic growth along the line			2
" rail creates value , " said @entity70 at the @entity71 , a transportation and public policy think tank in @entity74			0
she 's the director of @entity77 , a national initiative to meet the needs of the country over the next 40 years based on a projected population growth of 100 million			0
" it 's a permanent investment both residential and commercial investors can look at			0
there are the construction jobs in working on the railroad , " @entity70 said			0
people in the area are also put to work building the locomotives and rail cars			0
there are also indirect benefits that come with a new rail line , according to @entity70			0
" there are jobs related through real estate and commercial investment			0
these are long - term jobs			2
" but @entity10 's @entity100 governor - elect @entity99 said he has serious doubts about the projected job benefits related to the project			1
" the estimates , i think , are woefully optimistic			2
" @entity99 campaigned on a promise to kill high - speed rail in @entity10 , saying that it would leave the state with an annual operating cost of anywhere between $ 7.5 million and $ 15 million			1
" there are plenty of examples of federal @entity115 projects in the state of @entity10 that have terrible , terrible needs right now that are being unmet that to me would be a much better use of transportation dollars , " @entity99 said			0
officials at the @entity38 @entity123 said that up to 90 % of the operating costs could have been covered by federal grants			0
transportation secretary @entity39 tried unsuccessfully to change governor - elect @entity99 's mind before the funds were pulled			1
" there is no shortage of enthusiasm and energy in almost all 50 states in @entity77 for some form of high - speed inter-city rail , " @entity39 said			2
some of that enthusiasm was found in @entity50 which put out a request for proposals for a high - speed rail line to link @entity140 with several locations in and around @entity142			1
even though @entity50 received an additional $ 342 million from the @entity123 for the project , governor - elect @entity144 , a @entity100 , has n't made up his mind on whether he 'll allow it to proceed			2
@entity144 has said he is concerned that the price tag for the line would exceed estimates			0
he is also concerned about operating costs , he said			0
@entity50 's @entity123 claims close to 10,000 people would be employed in jobs directly related to the high - speed rail line during the height of construction and thousands more would be employed in indirect jobs			1
meanwhile , work is beginning on a section of a high - speed rail line in @entity45 that planners hope will one day link @entity48 with @entity49 .			1

@entity10 , @entity11 lose $ 1.2 billion in high - speed rail funds
officials question whether it 's still possible to build big
4,700 jobs would be created , outgoing governor said
" the estimates , i think , are woefully optimistic , " says governor - elect
