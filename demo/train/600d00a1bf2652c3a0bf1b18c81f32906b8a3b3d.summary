-- a day after @entity3 became the latest state to approve a constitutional amendment defining marriage as solely between a man and a woman , opponents of the referendum are beginning wednesday to explore their next options			1
@entity3 voted tuesday to outlaw same - sex marriage , which was already prohibited in the state			1
supporters pushed for the constitutional amendment , arguing that it is needed to ward off future legal challenges			2
voters approved the amendment by a 61 % -39 % margin with all counties reporting , according to unofficial returns from the @entity19			2
" it is a very sad day in @entity3 , " said @entity20 , 23 , a @entity21 resident who voted against the amendment			1
" there were a lot of college students , young professionals who came out to vote			0
a lot of us are integrated to that culture			0
do you think your friends should have the same rights ? it 's black and white			0
of course , they should			0
" the @entity3 amendment alters the constitution to say that " marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized " in the state			1
" it writes discrimination into our state constitution and gives the majority the chance to vote against the minority , " said @entity44 , 33 , of @entity45			1
but @entity53 , which supported the amendment , applauded the passage , saying it solidifies the state ban and ensures the definition of marriage does not change			1
" we are not anti-gay ; we are pro-marriage , " said @entity59 , chairwoman of the group			2
" and the point -- the whole point -- is simply that you do n't rewrite the nature of @entity65 's design for marriage based on the demands of a group of adults			2
" experts expressed concerns that the language of the amendment is so vague , it could strip other unmarried couples of some rights as well			2
it could affect unmarried couples who live together and bring them unintended consequences on issues such as child custody and the prosecution of domestic violence , said @entity84 , a law professor at @entity85			0
it also strengthens the state 's position against same - sex civil unions , often considered a precursor to the marriage issue , @entity86 said			1
some municipalities in @entity3 provide benefits to same - sex couples , and those rights could be lost with passage of the amendment , she said			1
opponents of the amendment regroup wednesday to decide the next course of action , with some planning campaigns in cities across the state this week			1
the groups acknowledged the loss but urged supporters to keep fighting			0
" we ca n't change the results of this vote , but we can determine what comes next , " said @entity111 , director of @entity112			0
" when kids across the state wake up , i want them to know that this story is n't over			0
" campaign for @entity121 said it will launch a " we do campaign to take action " wednesday , with events planned across various cities all week			2
another group , @entity125 , plans to hold a news conference wednesday to discuss the amendment			2
but its backers said they are not deterred			0
" despite the relentless lawsuits and attempts to marginalize supporters of traditional marriage , a clear majority of the @entity133 people have not given up on standing in support of marriage , " said @entity129 , president of @entity130			0
" but instead , the evidence suggests they want to see it strengthened and preserved for future generations			0
" the @entity144 and @entity145 voted in 2011 to put the amendment before state voters			2
both chambers are @entity149 - controlled for the first time in 140 years			0
president @entity152 said he was " disappointed " by the vote , describing it as discriminatory against gays and lesbians , a spokesman said			0
@entity133 overall are closely split on the issue , according to a recent @entity159 survey			0
about 50 % of @entity133 believe same - sex couples should be allowed to wed -- up considerably from polls in past years			1
an additional 48 % say such marriages should not be legal			0
before tuesday , 30 states had voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union			2
" of states without constitutional amendments on marriage , 45 % ( nine of 20 ) eventually recognize same - sex marriage , either by direct judicial decree , by legislative action , or by a ruling requiring that same - sex marriages from other states be treated as valid , " the @entity169 , which opposes same - sex marriages , said in a statement			1
" among the 30 states with marriage amendments , none have been repealed			0
" @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and the @entity191 issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples			1
in february , @entity194 gov. @entity193 signed a bill that would legalize same - sex marriage beginning in june , but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue			1
@entity203 gov. @entity202 signed into law a bill that permits the state 's same - sex couples to wed as of january 1 , and state residents may vote to affirm such a law			1
@entity210 will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in @entity3			1
@entity212 will have a referendum on allowing same - sex marriage			1
@entity0 's @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report .			0

" we are not anti-gay ; we are pro-marriage , " a *proponent* of the amendment says
" it is a very sad day in @entity3 , " says @entity20 , who voted against the amendment
the amendment puts an existing ban on same - sex marriage into the state constitution
opponents of the amendment regroup wednesday to decide the next course of action
