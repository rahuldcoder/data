-- @entity2 ' year - end championships are supposed to showcase the top eight players in the world but monday 's opening matches in @entity6 took a backseat to another butting of heads between the two biggest names in the sport			2
the difference of opinion came as @entity14 beat @entity15 6 - 3 6 - 7 6 - 3 in the afternoon and @entity16 defeated @entity17 6 - 7 6 - 3 7 - 5 in the nightcap			1
having disagreed about a potential two - year ranking system and a previous selection of the @entity22 's executive chairman , the latest dispute between @entity24 and @entity25 revolves around the surface for the @entity27			1
@entity28 's @entity24 says the tournament should remain on an indoor hard court but @entity31 @entity25 wants it played outdoors and on surfaces including his preferred clay			1
@entity24 and his attacking game flourish under a roof -- he was unbeaten on indoor hard courts for two years from late 2010 -- and the 17 - time grand slam winner boasts a career winning ratio of over 80 % when playing inside			1
@entity25 's indoor strike rate , meanwhile , stands at about 66 % -- and the world no. 1 has even less success on carpet			1
@entity44 is undeniably his most successful surface , with eight of his 13 grand slam triumphs coming at the @entity47			0
@entity25 has never won the @entity27 while @entity24 has on six occasions , with four of those coming indoors -- @entity50 in 2003 and 2004 proving the exception			1
" i believe it should be indoor and hard , " @entity24 , president of the @entity52 , told @entity0 on sunday			1
" i know there 's an argument to have it on clay , on grass , to have it outdoors -- and i did play outdoors in @entity50			0
" i just feel indoors does n't have enough play			0
the indoor season is small			2
i believe indoors deserves a huge event , which this one is			2
" playing the tournament in such fashion is a natural extension of the @entity66 " indoor swing " that begins in the middle of october			1
prior to @entity6 , @entity68 staged the year - end showpiece on an indoor carpet and then on an indoor hard court from 2005 to 2008			2
the last time it was contested on a surface other than hard or carpet was way back in 1974 , on grass in @entity76 , and @entity25 insists it is time for a change			1
the @entity22 , he says , should be " fairer " with the players			0
" i know it 's not going to happen for my generation , " @entity25 , who stepped down as vice-president of the players council last year , told reporters on monday			1
" i 'm talking for the future generations , something that will be a little bit fairer for the players			0
and i think for the fans it will be interesting to change the surface every year to the surfaces we qualified on for the ( @entity27 )			2
" a good player has a chance to qualify for the ( @entity27 ) four or five times in his career , so if during this four years you have a different surface every year , a minimum one time he will have the chance to play on his favorite surface			2
" in an interview with @entity0 last week , @entity102 , tournament director of the @entity27 and the @entity22 's chief player officer , said changing surfaces would make for an " interesting concept " but presented some problems			1
" if it 's something the players want and can be done logistically , it 's something we can explore , " said @entity102			0
" even in the same place it would be pretty unique if you have all of a sudden one year on a hard court in @entity6 and the next year on a clay court			0
" but it 's hard for players to switch surfaces			0
i think guys who have n't played on clay for six months would n't be comfortable going back to a surface they have n't experienced in six months			0
" i 'm not opposed to it but i just think it becomes hard because of the logistics			0
" when asked about the issue by reporters , @entity128 -- the third most successful active player in the men 's game -- did n't " know what to say rightly			0
" the @entity131 , however , said the championships should n't be held in the same city for more than three years			0
@entity6 's stint will hit seven seasons come the end of its term in 2015 and @entity102 said there was " definitely " a possibility of a further extension			0
@entity24 told @entity0 he was n't opposed to the idea			2
on tuesday , the @entity28 enters the action when he meets @entity128 in the evening session with @entity25 facing compatriot @entity144 earlier in the day .			1
