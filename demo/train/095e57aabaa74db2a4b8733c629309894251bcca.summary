the nanny 's duties are written into the custody order , she said , " i believe that mr. @entity11 resents the court order requiring that he have a nanny , and that his resentment has developed into dangerous and aggressive behavior towards me , particularly when i am in the presence of @entity13 , " @entity12 said			1
" i am truly fearful he will hurt me and in the process hurt @entity13 as well			0
" @entity11 has been " verbally abusive and aggressive towards me , " she said			1
" he would say things to me like , ' what are you doing here ? ' ' you are a spy , ' ' you report everything i say , ' ' you 're not even doing your job			0
' ' @entity13 does n't like you , she does n't want you here , ' an ' i do n't need a nanny , i do n't want you here , ' " her statement said			2
her sworn declaration describes an incident last week when she went to @entity11 's apartment in @entity0 to pick up @entity13			1
" as i was opening the door with the key he opened the door from inside , " she said			0
" @entity13 was all dressed and ready to go			0
i again expressed my concern to mr. @entity11 regarding the lack of communication about @entity13			2
" that 's when @entity11 began screaming at her , she said			1
" while he was screaming at me @entity13 reached up her arms to me for me to pick her up , which i did			0
@entity13 put her head on my shoulder			0
mr. @entity83 violently pushed me , while i had @entity13 in my arms , against both my shoulders with both of his hands , " she said			0
she noted that @entity11 is 11 inches taller than her			2
" i was thrown in to the wall behind me while still holding @entity13 , " she said			0
the push was so forceful that if there had not been a wall behind me to stop the force of my movement i would have fallen down with @entity13 in my arms			0
he then slammed the door			0
i got away with @entity13 as quickly as i could			0
" @entity12 's statement also described clashes with @entity11 in @entity97 where @entity34 was shooting a movie last september			1
" while there , for a week consistently , every time @entity13 would be playing on the floor with me , he would walk over and violently grab / take @entity13 away from me , " she said			0
" in the night , i would hear @entity13 crying and asking for me , but he would not let @entity13 come to me , nor me to her			0
he repeatedly told me to ' shut up , ' and that ' i did n't know anything ' and other degrading remarks			0
