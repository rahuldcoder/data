-- in the end it was the clown who had the last laugh			0
in 1973 , @entity5 prepared for a crucial @entity7 qualifier against @entity8 , a team hidden behind the @entity10 of communism which had provided little footballing resistance in the recent past			1
the @entity14 had n't qualified for an international tournament since before the @entity16			0
their players were unknowns , presumed inferior			0
@entity5 , on the other hand , had won the @entity7 on the very same @entity20 pitch they were about to play on just seven years earlier			1
it was a team of stars coached by sir @entity23			0
it was to be a cake walk			0
such was the mismatch that the iconic @entity28 coach @entity27 dismissed @entity8 's goalkeeper @entity29 as " a clown			1
" " would you want him in your team every week ? " asked the man who led @entity32 to successive @entity34 titles			0
it was a phrase that followed @entity27 for the rest of his career			0
in front of 100,000 @entity5 fans , @entity8 held on to a 1 - 1 draw			1
" @entity49 " had the game of his life and @entity5 failed to make it to @entity48 1974			1
in fact , they would n't reach another @entity7 for close to a decade			2
@entity52 : by the numbers but for the @entity8 , the draw was the beginning of a story that saw the national team strut on the international stage for another 13 years , taking them to two third - place @entity7 finishes with a group of one of the most talented , and unheralded , groups of players @entity65 has ever produced			1
" i remember everything of this match that opened for @entity8 the door to the world 's football , " recalls @entity66 , the legendary @entity8 and @entity67 forward who watched the match as a 17 - year - old aspiring footballer back home			1
" i remember every action of the goalkeeper , the anger of the @entity5 team that was n't able to win and the spectacular counterattacks			1
" @entity8 's qualification for the 1974 @entity7 seemed to come from nowhere			1
" @entity8 had n't qualified for a @entity7 since 1938 ; they had no recent history , " explains @entity83 , author of " @entity86 , " a book about football in @entity65			1
" they were just another bunch of @entity65 to be beaten			0
@entity5 did have 30 chances , but the draw gave them ( @entity8 ) a boost of confidence			1
that momentum carried them on			0
" when @entity8 arrived at the 1974 @entity7 , it was loaded with symbolism			1
it was hosted in @entity48 just decades after @entity8 had been decimated by its @entity98 neighbor during @entity16			2
while many consider the 1974 @entity7 as the great coronation which announced the arrival of the @entity102 and @entity104 's " @entity103 , " @entity8 excelled with equal creativity			1
racism overshadows @entity52 while @entity29 went from clown to being considered one of the best goalkeepers in @entity65 , up front the @entity8 had the legendary @entity109			1
he would go on to score eight goals , winning the @entity111 along the way			0
they went all the way to the semifinals against @entity48			0
@entity8 lost that game 1 - 0 in treacherous conditions before winning the third - place playoff against the holders @entity120			2
" i can remember one game where i 've always maintained we beat a team which was fundamentally better than us			0
in fact , it was definitely the best team in the competition and still did n't win the @entity7			1
i mean @entity8 in 1974 , " the legendary @entity129 and @entity48 defender @entity128 told @entity131 's website			1
" they had a better team at that @entity7 than @entity48 , @entity134 , @entity120 , or anyone else for that matter			2
the @entity8 had the best team in 1974			1
" " it 's a way of kicking the @entity102 ! " laughs @entity83 when asked about @entity128 's comments , referencing the fierce footballing rivalry between the @entity140 and the @entity102			0
" the @entity140 were still worthy winners			0
but could @entity8 have won the @entity7 ? definitely			1
the game against @entity48 could have gone either way			0
" pulling the strings was legendary coach @entity145			0
heavily influenced by the tactical revolution taking place in the @entity148 and the @entity149 , he took @entity8 to the @entity150 and won gold there , nurturing a fast , counterattacking team and bringing through players like @entity109 , @entity155 and @entity156			1
" he seems to have been a very avuncular figure , a real father figure , " explains @entity83			0
" he actually involved them in the decision - making process			0
" @entity162 needed a vigorous hierarchy , you could n't questions things or speak spontaneously			0
but @entity145 encouraged that , the balance of authority and respecting views			0
" one player who was brought into the @entity8 team by @entity145 was @entity66			1
it was one of his final acts as coach			0
" he is the symbol of @entity8 , " @entity66 told @entity0			1
" he was the first coach that made us believe ( we coul ) ] rise to world levels			0
he was a hero and now that he 's gone he has become a legend			0
" the 1978 @entity7 in @entity180 will always be tainted with the accusations of corruption leveled at the ruling @entity183			2
@entity66 too felt that @entity8 's cause was n't helped by having to play the hosts			1
" the @entity8 team of 1978 was the greatest @entity8 team of all time , " he believes			2
" ( but ) we ended up politically in a very difficult ground			0
@entity180 played at home and for that reason it was very protected			0
" after a strong start , topping a group ahead of @entity48 , @entity8 headed into the second pool phase where @entity180 thrashed @entity195 6 - 0			2
at the 1978 @entity7 , the two top teams in each group contested the final and that controversial result , coupled with losses against the hosts and later @entity120 , made it impossible for @entity8 to qualify			1
yet the team bounced back for the 1982 @entity7 in @entity204 where @entity66 made his name , scoring a hat - trick against @entity207			1
@entity8 again finished third at what is today regarded as one of the greatest @entity210 of all time			2
" let 's say that the match against @entity207 is my business card , " says @entity66			2
" we were compact , a great group			0
there were n't those champions of ' 74 and ' 78 but we played great football			0
" it was more than just football that was changing in @entity8			2
the late 1970s and early 1980s saw the emergence of @entity222 , a @entity8 dock worker whose solidarity trade union movement would rise from the @entity224 on the @entity225 and strike the first nail into communism 's coffin			2
" @entity162 had a great impact on the football , " explains @entity229 , a @entity8 football journalist and prominent blogger			2
" look at each ( local ) club and every single one of them was supported by a factory , local branch ( of the @entity237 ) , police , army			0
it ( football ) was almost a fight between the authorities			0
" " the communist regime always wanted to put its face on every sporting success , " recalls @entity66			2
" but we wanted to play football and so we were n't interested in this			0
" as communism 's grip loosened in @entity8 , the national football team began to fade			1
@entity66 's @entity8 did qualify fora fourth consecutive @entity7 at @entity253 in 1986 but lost heavily to @entity5 before being beaten convincingly by @entity120 4 - 1			1
they would not make another @entity7 for 16 years			2
but their grace on the international stage during two golden generations of players will never be forgotten in @entity8			1
in fact , for some like @entity229 it is not forgotten too often			0
" the heroes of past years are remembered well , " he says			0
" still the @entity8 media are matching the current squad , club teams and individuals to the ones that have graced the pitch 30 , 40 years ago ... there is a spirit of the ' 70s and ' 80s that allows us to recall the glory and link to it at every occasion			1
@entity8 do that very often , believe me ! " but now @entity8 is preparing to host its first major international tournament since the fall of communism			2
for the @entity8 , @entity52 is something of a coming of age party , a chance to show the world it has moved on from its communist past			1
" @entity8 is not becoming a leading @entity283 nation , " says @entity66			1
" @entity8 already is a ( leading ) @entity283 nation , 100 %			1
for some aspects it could be a model for other nations			0
" all that has been missing has been a football team to match @entity8 's incredible political and economic growth of the past two decades			1
and maybe even the perpetually skeptical @entity8 have reason to hope			2
whereas some of the last crop of top players decided to play for @entity48 rather than @entity8 -- such as @entity294 and @entity295 -- in @entity297 's striker @entity296 and captain @entity296 the country has two players that would grace any team at the @entity302			1
" in the past @entity8 's football team was stronger , maybe because life for children is different			1
and also because they do n't have the same tenacity that we had in the past , " says @entity66			0
" but in the end ( to ) win against @entity8 at home will be always very difficult			0
" when the @entity8 national team walk out on to the pitch at their stunning new national stadium in @entity316 on friday , they will walk with the ghosts of the past in more ways than one .			2

@entity8 are *co-hosting* @entity52 and are keen to show they are a leading @entity283 *democracy*
their current football team is at a low ebb but they *enjoyed* a golden spell during the 1970s and 80s
in 1974 their *derided* team gained a draw with @entity5 that sent them to the @entity7
players like striker @entity66 and goalkeeper @entity29 were *instrumental*
