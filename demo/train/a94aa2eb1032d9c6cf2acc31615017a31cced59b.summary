@entity0 -- for politicians seeking public office , a stop at the iconic @entity3 is a must			1
this @entity8 institution has become a symbol of the strength of the @entity12 vote			0
here , @entity14 exiles have turned their conservative stance against the @entity17 regime into a political force to be reckoned with in @entity20 politics			1
" it forces politicians to learn @entity23 , " said journalist @entity24 , " even if it 's a few words			0
" during a @entity28 debate last week , rep. @entity26 mentioned her visit to @entity3 as she tried to establish a rapport with @entity12 voters			1
it was one of the first references to @entity3 in the nascent presidential campaign season , but it likely wo n't be the last			0
according to the 2010 census , the @entity12 community is the fastest - growing segment of the @entity20 population			1
the @entity40 estimates that , out of more than 50 million hispanics in the @entity20 , 24 million will be eligible to vote next year			0
in @entity46 , many of those voters are @entity47 who are longtime residents of the region , but have been hoping to return to their countries of origin once the political and economic situation of the region changed , @entity43 professor @entity42 said			0
as time goes on , those families are becoming increasingly active in politics -- taking a page from the @entity14 - @entity20 political playbook , though not necessarily following their political views			1
in @entity0 , @entity42 said , 60 % of @entity41 are @entity60			2
the @entity62 - @entity20 , who chaired @entity64 's 2008 presidential campaign in @entity0 , said new voters of @entity62 descent are registering democrats at a 2 - to - 1 ratio			1
the tea party is part of the reason , he said			2
" some of the @entity69 views are too radical for @entity41 , " he said			1
that sentiment is echoed by @entity74 , the publisher of @entity76 newspaper			0
" @entity78 message is not one @entity41 want to hear , nor do we want to be the target of some of the ideas they propose , " @entity74 said			0
according to @entity42 , those ideas revolve around one issue that crosses country loyalties : immigration			0
" @entity88 , @entity62 , @entity89 ... they all still identify themselves as immigrants , and the status of the immigrant is in peril right now due to the right - leaning tendencies in the country , " he said			0
but conservative @entity12 politicians fared very well in the last election -- some of them buoyed by the support of tea party loyalists			1
@entity101 , now a congressman from @entity102 , was a voice for the tea party during the debt ceiling debate			1
in @entity107 , @entity106 became the first @entity12 governor in the @entity20 with the support of @entity110 and tea party activists			1
in a recent interview , @entity106 told @entity1 the tea party has fiscal policies that are good for the country			2
" i think the tea party makes us think different and gives us more options from where to choose when it comes to electing candidates , " @entity106 said			2
@entity46 sen. @entity122 also rode the @entity69 wave that swept @entity28 into @entity124 last year			0
but he has been criticized for his stance against illegal immigration , and @entity42 said he 's seen @entity122 trying to distance himself from the tea party			2
next year 's elections will be a key indicator of whether tea party policies will drive @entity12 voters into @entity60 ' arms for years to come , @entity42 said			1
but democrats in @entity46 are n't claiming victory just yet			0
@entity136 , a @entity137 who lost a congressional bid last year , said conservative @entity140 are still the dominant force in @entity46 , and they will continue to be for the foreseeable future .			0
