editor 's note : @entity2 is professor emeritus of history at the @entity4			1
he is the author of 15 books , including " @entity6 : the crash of 1929 " and most recently " @entity8 : steam , electricity , and the @entity9			1
" historian @entity2 says it 's important to remember that psychology plays a huge role in financial markets			1
( @entity16 ) -- friday marks the 79th anniversary of the day that launched the stock market crash of 1929			1
as an unprecedented wave of selling threw the floor of the @entity23 into pandemonium on a day that became known as @entity26 , a show of organized support by a coterie of leading bankers halted the panic			0
but on the following monday , the market collapsed in a tsunami of selling			1
every intense convulsion of the stock market raises primal fears spawned by the @entity38 and the ensuing @entity39 , which dragged on for a full decade and has haunted @entity40 ever since			1
the panic of 2008 is no exception			0
in the past year , the market 's fall has at times rivaled that of 1929			1
are there connections or similarities between those earlier national traumas and our current crisis ? first some facts about that earlier experience			2
the @entity26 and the @entity39 were two separate events			1
the crash was a financial panic , the depression an economic downturn			1
the one does not necessarily lead to the other ; the market has collapsed several times in @entity40 history without bringing on a depression			1
@entity39 holds lessons for surviving a tough economy the crash began in october 1929 , and the worst of it was over in three weeks ; the @entity39 did not fasten itself on the nation for another year			1
to this day , the connection between them remains unclear , which makes it difficult to draw lessons or analogies from them			0
the @entity78 plunged 39 percent between october 23 and november 13 , 1929 , but it regained 74 percent of that loss by march 1930			2
only when the economy failed to gain momentum in the spring did the market slip back			2
by fall the country had slipped into a depression , and the market resumed a downward course that did not touch bottom until july 1932			1
it did not again return to the levels of 1929 until 1954			2
the @entity39 did not end until increased military spending revived the economy in the spring of 1940			0
the bull market of the 1920s was unique in that it marked the first time large numbers of ordinary people participated			1
the market moved from @entity97 to @entity98 and aroused intense interest even among people who were not active in it			1
the new investors , or " fish " as the pros called them , were prone to panic when the market fell sharply			2
could it happen again ? history never repeats itself , but historical patterns do -- though always in a new context			0
here are just a few of the similarities and differences between the earlier crisis and its modern version			2
during the 1920s , the financial industry underwent a great expansion , bringing into the business many inexperienced people and new investment vehicles -- most notably the investment trust , the forerunner of the modern mutual fund			1
nobody knew what impact they would have on the market with their buying and selling on a large scale			2
the business world hailed the 1920s as the " @entity133 , " one with new rules in which the old pattern of cyclical depressions would no longer occur and prosperity would be continuous			2
compare this delusion with the " @entity139 " of the 1990s			0
the 1920s marked the beginning of the consumer economy , and with it a broad expansion of credit			0
installment buying made its debut on a large scale			0
credit also was used to buy stocks on margin , greatly increasing the market 's volume and volatility			2
the banking system was shaky throughout the 1920s , and failures escalated steadily after 1929			2
the crash exposed many cases of fraud that led to investigations and passage of the most significant banking reform in @entity40 history			1
the @entity165 of 1933 created the @entity166 , or @entity166 , gave rise to the @entity168 , or @entity168 , and separated investment banks from commercial banks			1
the latter reform was repealed in 1999 , giving banks free rein to perform both activities once again			2
some differences between the eras are worth noting			0
prior to 1933 , the federal government played virtually no active role in relieving the banking crisis of the 1920s			1
the stock market did not have giant institutional buyers moving huge blocks of stock			0
nor did it operate on a global scale , though it was deeply influenced by international events			0
after the crash , the banks had plenty of money to lend but no takers , the opposite of today 's situation			1
deflation became the mortal enemy as people removed their cash from banks and hoarded it			1
a familiar pattern emerged from these events			0
business and the @entity203 in the 1920s demanded and got a " free " market unrestrained by government			1
neither @entity97 nor the @entity23 was regulated by the government			0
the resulting disaster prompted outraged demands that @entity211 " do something			0
" regulation was then forthcoming			0
later , as prosperity returned and the market began soaring , the restraints were gradually removed and the pattern of excess began anew until it collapsed once again in our own time			0
with the fall comes renewed pleas for government to " do something			0
" finally , it is important to remember that psychology plays a huge role in financial markets			0
every panic has been at bottom a crisis of confidence			0
so too with the economy			0
as @entity236 observed , " prosperity is more than an economic condition ; it is a state of mind			0
" the trick is always to find out what exactly is needed to restore it			0
we are still fishing for the answer to that riddle			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : the 1929 market crash and the depression were separate events
many financial panics have not led to depressions , @entity2 says
before 1933 , the government was *n't* active in trying to save banks , he says
after crisis , people demanded regulation , which eventually faded , @entity2 says
