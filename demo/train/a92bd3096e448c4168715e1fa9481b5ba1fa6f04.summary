-- the image makers were in overdrive at the @entity3 this week			0
they finally had their candidate but now they had a problem : the guy was n't likable			0
and nowhere was that problem more acute than with women voters			2
concerns about @entity13 's slash - and - burn economic approach at @entity14 , coupled with displays on the campaign trail of his stunning lack of empathy had shaken confidence among women voters			1
add in the wound reopened when @entity23 candidate @entity22 spoke aloud the @entity25 's twisted ideas about women and rape and pregnancy , and the mandate to the handlers was infinitely clear : make every night @entity31 in @entity32			1
the show kicked off with @entity34 headlining the first night			0
her speech overflowed with love for her husband and family , and she deftly attempted to transfer those warm and fuzzy feelings to the women viewers			0
" i love you women ! i hear your voices , " she shouted at us as her husband 's proxy			2
throughout the week , prominent women , such as secretary of state @entity48 and @entity50 gov. @entity49 , headlined high profile events			0
vice presidential candidate @entity52 regaled us with tales of his truly amazing mom			0
and as @entity13 prepared to take the stage on the final night , a soft - focus video brought the love between @entity34 and @entity13 into full technicolor , while walk - ons from women of lesser stature were scattered throughout at a reassuring pace			1
by prime time , we could n't miss the marquee message : @entity13 loves women , so keep calm and carry on			1
@entity13 's largely biographical speech was light on substance and long on references to the ladies who had shaped him and supported his career , including those in senior leadership of his governor 's cabinet			1
his shout out to @entity79 gov. @entity78 and @entity81 sen. @entity80 , who had appeared that week on the dais , gave him an opportunity to invoke his mother 's posthumous approval of how far women have come			2
opinion : did @entity13 gain ground ? then , in a deluge of red , white and blue balloons , the pretty show ended and the workers began to dismantle the @entity93 , leaving the harsh sunlight of the day - after to reveal the intractable reality of what a @entity13 - @entity52 presidency would mean for @entity99 women			1
women voters care most about the economy and jobs			0
but with a critical caveat : nine out of 10 women say that a candidate must " understand women			0
" to do that requires an acknowledgment of two things : that women 's economic security -- by almost every measure -- still lags behind that of male counterparts and that their economic security is inextricably tied to their ability to control their health , including reproductive choices			1
and on those points , no illusions and tradesman 's tricks can obscure the fact that the @entity25 agenda fails the test			1
a @entity127 report showed that the 2007 @entity129 recession cost nearly 7.5 million jobs and recovery has been slow to reach women workers			0
public sector job loss drives this disparity			0
while @entity13 's jobs plan is still notoriously vague , with little to offer other than a regressive nod to trickle - down economics , @entity52 has been frighteningly clear that his top priority is essentially dismantling our government -- a fixation projected to result in a whopping 4.1 million lost jobs over two years			1
even the lucky few women who hold or get jobs under a @entity13 - @entity52 administration are likely to be paid far less for equal work			1
in the aggregate , women are paid on average 77 cents on the dollar to men , but @entity13 still refuses to support the @entity151 pay check @entity152			1
opinion : is that the best @entity13 can do ? what of the women who ca n't get jobs ? they can look forward to victimization and vilification			2
the 24 million women who live in poverty in @entity99 span all ethnic groups , with single moms twice as likely to be poor as single dads			0
still , @entity52 has proposed cutting nutrition assistance to these households , often the only thing that stands between them and malnutrition			0
meanwhile , in a cynical race play , the @entity13 campaign 's deceptive ad campaign attacking welfare recipients has denigrated these women instead of offering solutions			1
adding insult to injury , @entity13 's @entity3 platform includes an extremist anti-abortion amendment that removes exemptions even for rape and incest victims			1
a party that eliminates a woman 's right to choose while at the same time cutting pay , jobs , and access to health care and food security exposes a bizarre and dangerous lack of understanding of the challenges facing @entity99 women			2
no matter how much love bounced around the walls of the @entity93 , in real life , lip service and speeches -- even by women -- do n't feed the family			0
what women need is a sober assessment of how economic challenges uniquely affect us and solutions that reflect that understanding			0
and despite their best efforts over the last week , that 's one promise that a @entity13 - @entity52 presidency ca n't deliver			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			2

@entity215 says the @entity25 tried hard at *convention* to show they are on women 's side
she says a look at @entity223 positions and @entity25 platform show otherwise
she says both would prevent abortion even in rape or incest , would cut nutrition aid
@entity215 : @entity13 still refuses to support the @entity151 pay check @entity152 .
