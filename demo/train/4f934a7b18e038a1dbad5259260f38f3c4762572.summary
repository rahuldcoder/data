-- the @entity3 administration 's breach of religious freedom and freedom of conscience through the @entity9 agency 's contraception mandate has reignited the national conversation about the @entity11 , or " @entity11			1
" @entity11 encapsulates many of the major conservative objections to president @entity3 's presidency : the vast and costly expansion of government , increased taxes and regulations and the infringement of personal and religious liberties as is now being litigated in the federal and @entity21			1
the latest contraception mandate is only a precursor of what could come once @entity11 is fully implemented			1
the law itself grants the @entity28 -- an unelected bureaucrat -- far reaching powers			0
one breakdown of the law found more than 700 mentions to instruct that the secretary " shall " take action and more than 200 cases in which the secretary " may " issue regulations			0
we wo n't know the full extent of the secretary 's power until @entity11 is enforced , but if the contraception mandate is any indication , the secretary could have the power to regulate what health care @entity45 receive , what doctors they see and what insurance coverage they are eligible for			1
therefore , the @entity52 message in 2012 should n't focus singularly on the economy			1
politically , that would be unwise			0
even just the rumblings and perception of an economic recovery could be enough to carry president @entity3 to re-election			2
instead , @entity52 should get back to the message of 2010 , the year of the tea party and the retaking of the @entity63			1
for @entity52 , the stakes are economic liberty and the integrity of the @entity67			1
thus , the message of the tea party is more relevant now than ever			2
there are many @entity45 who see past the @entity3 administration 's rhetoric			2
they understand that a right created by the government , free access to birth control , does not trump the @entity76 and the freedom of religion or conscience			0
a new @entity0 poll , indeed , shows that half of all @entity45 disapprove of this new policy , while 44 % approve			0
i believe the more this policy is explained , the more the former number will increase and the latter contract			0
the contraception mandate is reason alone that @entity11 should be repealed , but the list does n't stop there			1
in 2013 , @entity11 will unleash an avalanche of taxes on individuals , businesses and insurers			1
( the list is quite long			0
) individuals and families who do not purchase the qualifying government health insurance will be forced to pay an income surtax , and employers who do not offer insurance will be penalized through additional taxes			0
highest earners will be hit with new surtaxes on investments and an increase in the @entity109 payroll tax			0
the medical business will bear the brunt of a new 2.3 % excise tax on medical device manufacturers and importers			0
already , @entity11 has stifled job creation and economic recovery			1
in a recent @entity120 survey , nearly half of all small business owners who are n't hiring cite health care costs and government regulations as the reasons why			0
@entity124 , the maker of artificial hips and knees , already announced it would lay off 5 % of its global workforce because of the medical device tax			0
furthermore , @entity11 will dramatically increase the cost of government health care and welfare programs while growing the national debt			1
according to the @entity137 's estimates and budget outlook for the next decade , by 2022 , spending on federal health care programs across the board will more than double			0
in particular , federal outlays for @entity140 will double , and spending per beneficiary in @entity143 will also double			0
the shellacking that @entity145 took in the 2010 elections was largely a referendum on @entity11			1
today still , the president 's landmark legislation remains a winning issue for conservatives			2
the latest @entity153 poll shows that 53 % of @entity45 at least somewhat favor repeal of the health care law and 38 % oppose it			0
regardless of what the @entity156 rules in the spring , @entity11 is indelibly symbolic of president @entity3 's record			1
conservatives are economically , morally and philosophically opposed to @entity11			2
yet until now , there has been low turnout in some of the recent @entity52 presidential primaries and caucuses			2
to reverse that , @entity11 , representing all that it means , should be the rallying cry that will reinvigorate and enlarge the base of opposition to the president -- again			1
