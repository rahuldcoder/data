@entity0 -- rights groups have slammed a lunch hosted by @entity5 's @entity4 on friday for including monarchs criticized for their countries ' human rights records			1
among those who attended the event at @entity11 is the king of @entity13 , whose government has come under fire for its crackdown on anti-government protests last year and its handling of continuing unrest			2
@entity21 's @entity20 , accused by critics of enjoying a lavish lifestyle at public expense while his people suffer great poverty , was also there			0
the monarchs ' lunch , with a menu that included @entity31 asparagus , lamb from @entity11 and strawberries from @entity34 , is part of celebrations of the @entity37 , marking her 60 years on the throne			2
it will be followed by an evening banquet at @entity42 hosted by @entity43 and the @entity44			0
human rights campaigner @entity45 said it was " outrageous that the queen has invited royal tyrants to celebrate her @entity37			1
" he called for the invitations to monarchs heading nations with poor records on rights to be withdrawn immediately and said protesters would stage a rally outside @entity42 as royals arrive for the dinner			1
" the invitations are a shocking misjudgment , " he said			0
" they show the queen is out of touch with the humanitarian values of most @entity5 people			0
she 's putting royalty before human rights			1
" no significant protests marked the monarchs ' arrival at @entity11 , where they were each greeted by the queen and the duke of @entity71 before sitting down to eat			2
but rights group @entity72 said the event risked giving the impression that @entity5 did not care about the victims of human rights abuses			1
" we can imagine why victims of recent human rights abuses in countries like @entity13 , @entity85 , @entity21 and @entity86 might feel their plight has been ignored when they see the guest list for the queen 's diamond jubilee celebrations , " said @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity80 director for @entity72			1
he said that @entity13 's @entity91 had tried to address the abuses committed last year by setting up an independent inquiry but that failures to ensure reforms are fully implemented " make his promises seem hollow			2
" @entity77 added : " he should use this occasion to commit to releasing the prisoners of conscience still held in @entity13 and ensure true accountability for the violations of the last year			0
" the @entity5 @entity103 said all the world 's sovereigns have been invited to the lunch , which was organized by the @entity107 with its support , although all will not necessarily attend			1
a @entity103 spokesman defended the inclusion of @entity91 at the lunch , saying @entity5 and @entity13 " work together closely on a range of important issues			1
" " the @entity5 is a longstanding friend and ally of @entity13 , and ministers regularly meet with @entity13 counterparts in the @entity5 and abroad , " he said			2
" this strong relationship also allows us to have a full and frank discussion on a range of√Ç issues including those where we have concerns			0
on human rights , we support the reforms already under way in @entity13 , and we want to help promote that reform			1
" the reforms include " bringing to account those individuals responsible for human rights abuses , " he said			2
@entity133 organizers were urged to cancel the @entity135 race in @entity13 last month because of concerns about human rights			1
@entity13 is home to the @entity138 and is viewed as an important bulwark against @entity141 's influence in the @entity142			0
@entity13 's king is not on the guest list for the smaller evening event , but @entity21 's monarch is among those invited to both lunch and dinner			1
the menus for the two meals have not been made public			0
royals from @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity85 and @entity86 are among those invited to both events , as are the emperor and empress of @entity164			0
the @entity166 queen did not attend , however , amid tensions over a planned visit by @entity169 and his wife next month to @entity171 , a @entity5 territory that @entity166 also claims			0
" @entity173 has canceled her visit to the @entity5 for the jubilee celebrations following the advice from the @entity166 government that the visit would be inappropriate in the current circumstances regarding @entity171 , " a spokesman for the @entity166 @entity107 said			0
@entity1 's @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report .			0

new : the kings of @entity13 and @entity21 are among the royals to attend the jubilee lunch
new : @entity4 greets each monarch on their arrival at @entity11
campaigners say monarchs from countries with poor human rights records should not be invited
@entity103 says @entity5 's relationship with @entity13 means it can push for more reforms
