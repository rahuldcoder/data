@entity1 , @entity0 -- about 200 @entity4 demonstrators marched up a narrow @entity1 street behind a large banner that said " political prisoners are our pride , we will not stay silent over the deaths in prison			1
" the group 's organizers were expecting trouble			0
they were marching on tuesday without a government permit			0
barely 200 yards up the road , the crowd encountered a squad of armored @entity0 riot police and a big police vehicle blocking the road			1
without any verbal warning , the vehicle lurched forward and unleashed its water cannon on the crowd			0
the demonstrators huddled behind their banner for a moment , until riot police unleashed a volley of tear gas canisters into the crowd			1
as stinging , acrid smoke engulfed the neighborhood , the middle - aged @entity4 demonstrators quickly gave way to masked youths hurling stones and fireworks at the police			1
tuesday marked the second time in two days @entity0 riot police used force against unsanctioned gatherings of political groups challenging the government			1
on monday , security forces in @entity44 used pepper spray and water cannons to disperse secularist groups trying to hold a rally celebrating the anniversary of the foundation of the @entity0 republic			1
participants gathered in defiance of a government ban			0
the next day , @entity0 's chief prosecutor announced he was launching an investigation into the secularist gathering			1
the crackdown during @entity59 in @entity44 highlighted how powerless @entity0 's once dominant secular establishment has become			1
it has also led to accusations by long - time supporters in @entity0 newspapers that @entity0 's @entity66 - rooted prime minister is adopting the same authoritarian tactics of the secularist ancient regime			1
tuesday 's @entity4 clashes reflect a different power struggle			1
the riots in @entity1 and other @entity0 cities mark yet another day in a bloody 30 - year cycle of violence between the @entity0 state and the @entity76			1
it is @entity0 's oldest and deadliest ethnic conflict , one that has claimed more than 30,000 lives			1
the conflict developed a disturbing new dynamic in recent weeks as a mass hunger strike has spread through the @entity0 penal system			1
according to the @entity0 government statistics , at least 680 @entity4 prisoners are now starving themselves , some for nearly 50 days			1
" they want two things , " said @entity88 , a member of the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , which is @entity0 's largest and best - organized @entity4 nationalist party			1
" the right to education and defense in court in their native language , and for the leader of the @entity76 , @entity96 , to have health , security and freedom			0
" for decades , the @entity4 language was banned in @entity0 despite the fact the @entity76 make up the country 's largest ethnic minority			1
those restrictions have been relaxed over the past decade by the government of prime minister @entity106 , which introduced a state @entity4 - language television station			2
but @entity4 partisans want to expand those linguistic freedoms			2
the demand for the release of @entity96 is much more problematic			0
he is the founder of the @entity114 , or @entity114 , a group that @entity0 , the @entity117 and the @entity118 label as a ' terrorist organization			2
' though @entity96 has spent more than a decade imprisoned on a @entity0 island in the @entity124 , the guerilla war he began against the @entity0 state continues to be fought			2
last month , the nonprofit conflict mediation organization @entity125 published a report arguing @entity0 's @entity114 conflict had reached its deadliest levels in some 13 years , with more than 700 people killed during a 14 month period			1
last weekend , @entity0 's semiofficial @entity131 reported a police officer was killed in an apparent rebel attack in southeastern @entity0 , the main battle ground in the conflict			1
the @entity125 report also cited @entity0 @entity138 statistics indicating @entity76 have been targets of a massive wave of detentions , with more than 7,000 prisoners accused of @entity114 links thrown behind bars over the past several years			2
the parents of some of those prisoners were in a tent in a park in @entity1 's @entity151 neighborhood tuesday morning , staging a sit - in to support their children on hunger strike			2
women in @entity4 head - scarves sat on carpets , some of them decorated with traditional facial tattoos , swaying and singing folks songs in @entity4			2
" of course we are worried , " said @entity162 , whose 26 - year old daughter @entity163 had been on hunger strike for the past 15 days			0
asked whether it was worth losing her daughter to improve prison conditions for @entity114 - leader @entity96 , @entity162 said simply " thousands of our people have thrown themselves on the fire for our leader			0
" @entity171 and his wife , @entity172 , were participating in the sit - in for their daughter @entity174			0
she was arrested two and a half years ago at the age of 18 , @entity171 said , and accused of membership in a terrorist organization , though she had yet to be convicted in court			0
" no one has the right to make our kids rot in jail like this for two and a half years , " @entity171 said			0
he insisted the hunger strikers were staging their potentially lethal protest in the interest of peace			0
" these kids have given their bodies to the fire of hunger ... not just for the @entity4 people , but for the future of @entity0			1
so that this war can end , so that neither soldiers , police or guerillas in the mountains die , " @entity171 added			0
last week , @entity0 's justice minister made a televised appeal to prisoners to stop their hunger strike			1
" reform and change , work on expanding freedoms is ongoing , " @entity205 said during a visit to a prison in @entity44			2
" for your bodies , for your health , for the family members who love you ... stop this action			0
" but on tuesday , riot police in @entity1 had little sympathy for relatives of the prisoners			1
as squads of riot police and armored cars chased stone - throwing @entity76 through the streets of @entity151 , a police vehicle rounded a corner and started firing its water cannon at the tent where at least 20 mostly middle aged @entity4 women sat on carpets			1
a lawyer for the @entity76 rushed forward , arguing that the sit - in by the @entity4 mothers was peaceful and had nothing to do with the nearby street clashes			1
" they are throwing @entity239 cocktails at us , " a police commander answered			0
" they can have 15 minutes to leave the area			0
" but less than five minutes later , armored police officers began ripping down the tent			0
another officer popped open a tear gas canister and tossed it into the tent , at the feet of the increasingly panicked women inside			0
as women stumbled to their feet half - blind trying to escape , a @entity4 man kicked the canister out of the tent			2
a police officer in a suit and gas mask then picked it up and threw it back into the tent			0
" get the mothers ! get the mothers out of there ! " yelled a silver - haired @entity4 man named @entity258 , as he struggled to help a woman out of the tent			2
a half dozen police officers in helmets and gas masks then worked together to rip down one of the metal ribs holding up the tent			0
" enough ! " another @entity4 man screamed			2
" what has this woman done wrong ? you 're only doing this because i do n't have a gun			0
" moments later , the police withdrew			0
reinforcements were arriving in the neighborhood			0
but the protests were also growing			0
a kilometer away , young @entity4 men momentarily blocked a major commercial road ... intimidating drivers by laying rocks on the pavement			2
@entity0 's @entity4 conflict is still very far from over .			1

tuesday is the second time in two days @entity0 riot police used force against protesters
on monday , security forces in @entity44 used pepper spray and water cannons
tuesday 's @entity4 clashes reflect a different power struggle
