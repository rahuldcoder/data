-- it may not be conclusive proof of climate change , but every couple of years brings another " @entity7 " to air - conditioned multiplexes across the globe			1
each of its predecessors made more money than the one that came before , so there 's an inevitability about this fourth venture -- " @entity7 : @entity17 " -- even if it bears telltale signs of creative exhaustion and , yes , drift			1
the franchise started out as a prehistoric , slapstick spin on the old @entity24 western , " @entity36 , " with a woolly mammoth , a sloth and a sabre - toothed tiger ( @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , voiced by @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 ) delivering an orphaned human baby to safety			1
it has evolved -- or maybe " devolved " -- into a scrappy string of antic adventures interspersed with sitcom - style character notes , all pegged to whatever novelty the writing team can contrive in place of a plot			1
in part three it was a subterranean dinosaur lair			1
in this episode , an unfortunate incident with an acorn at the earth 's core precipitates tectonic realignment			2
when the continents part ways , @entity28 and the guys are trapped on an iceberg heading out to sea with only @entity29 's nutty grandmother ( @entity59 ) for company			2
@entity28 's quest to be reunited with wife @entity62 ( @entity63 ) and teen daughter @entity64 ( @entity65 ) is interrupted by a gang of scurvy pirates , led by a tricorn - headed orangutan , captain @entity69 ( @entity70 )			2
whoever thought it was a good idea to spike this tired series with the defining component from a rival , equally over-extended franchise ( not to mention the recent @entity77 pirate caper ) , well , here 's a thought : maybe you could introduce a web - slinging spider - boy in the next one ? you know , just to keep things fresh ! the animation is dynamic and crisp , but the story just runs around in circles while we wait for the sky to fall down			1
truth be told , it 's a kick that @entity91 is distributing a movie about the dangers of climate change			1
" does n't it worry you that this is the @entity98 ? " someone asks a particularly unintelligent couple of party - hearty mammals			2
uh - uh , they respond			0
" i guess we can tell you our secret ... we 're really , really stupid			0
" like the equally stretched - to - the - breaking - point " @entity109 " series , " @entity7 " has accumulated too many characters with too little to do , and all - star vocal stylings ( " @entity17 " adds @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and even @entity115 , to name a few ) can only do so much by way of compensation			1
a bigger problem : the trio of reprobates at the center of proceedings have become so domesticated over the years , whatever mild comic edge they used to have has been dulled to a soft nub			0
the loner , @entity28 , is now a boringly over-bearing father			0
the aggressive @entity30 is just a big pussycat			0
only pea - brained @entity29 has stayed true to type , which will please infants more than their parents			0
( for the record , everything i disliked about this movie -- the dumb teen mammoth romance subplot , the narwhal - propelled iceberg , and especially the irritating @entity29 -- were selected as personal highlights by my 7 - year - old			1
) as in the earlier films , the most enterprising comedy features the mute squirrel , @entity143 , who 's @entity146 - inspired misadventures are almost always a welcome distraction -- even if we already saw too much of this material in teasers released last year			0
better than any of this is the five - minute @entity152 short ( " @entity153 " ) that precedes the feature			0
a starring vehicle for baby @entity157 , this is sharp , witty visual slapstick that harks back to the silent era for inspiration			0
true to form , my kid hated it .			0
