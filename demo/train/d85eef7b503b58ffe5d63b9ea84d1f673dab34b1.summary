@entity0 -- a shipwreck laden with 200 tonnes of silver -- the largest haul of precious metal ever found at sea -- has been discovered in the @entity7			2
the wreck of the @entity9 , a @entity11 steamship sunk by a @entity13 u-boat during @entity14 , was found 300 miles off the coast of @entity16 by underwater archaeology and salvage experts @entity19			1
the @entity21 company has explored the wreck which lies 4,700 meters down , on the sea bed , using a remotely operated submarine			1
it now hopes to bring the @entity9 's valuable cargo of silver bullion to the surface			1
@entity19 's senior project manager @entity29 said : " we 've accomplished the first phase of this project - the location and identification of the target shipwreck			0
now we 're hard at work planning for the recovery phase			0
" @entity29 said he was " extremely confident " the company would be able to salvage the seven million ounces of silver ( 200 tonnes ) , which was worth more than Â £ 600,000 in 1941			2
the 412ft steel - hulled @entity9 was built in 1919 for the @entity40 , and originally served as a cargo ship on routes to and from the @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
when the @entity14 broke out , she was ordered into @entity11 's merchant navy			0
in february 1941 , the @entity9 was traveling from @entity48 , @entity49 , to @entity50 , @entity11 , with a cargo of silver , tea and pig iron when she became separated from the rest of her convoy in bad weather			1
as the crew battled to bring the ship , which was running low on fuel , safely in to port at @entity63 in @entity16 , she was struck by a torpedo from a @entity13 u-boat			1
more than 30 of the 85 sailors on board the @entity9 are believed to have made it onto lifeboats , but only one , second officer @entity66 made it safely home , landing in @entity74 after drifting at sea for two weeks			1
@entity19 says it does not expect to find any human remains on the wreck			0
@entity79 , @entity19 's @entity80 , said that -- as a former merchant mariner -- the story of the @entity9 had struck a chord with him			2
" even though records indicate that the lifeboats were launched before the ship sank , sadly most of her crew did not survive the long journey to shore , " he said			0
" by finding this shipwreck , and telling the story of its loss , we pay tribute to the brave merchant sailors who lost their lives			0
" the company won a @entity11 government contract to search for and salvage the ship			0
under the terms of the agreement , it will keep 80 % of the value of any silver recovered from the wreck .			0
