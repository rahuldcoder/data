-- if the last several years have taught us anything , it 's that the world is in constant flux			1
regimes topple , borders are redrawn , whole countries are born anew			1
while the fighters are remaking their world , however , the lovers are evidently stuck in the 1800s			1
ask anyone what the world 's most romantic cities are and they 'll likely reply in kneejerk fashion , " @entity18 ... " " @entity19 ... " " @entity20 ... " but what 's so romantic about coffee breath , crumbling infrastructure and the smell of urine ? and what is romance , anyway ? is it a ride on a unicorn over a rainbow through a glitter storm ? or is it the excitation of the senses that forms the preamble for the box spring bustle ? dispensing with the typical fairytale travel planning , we 've opted for a more results - oriented approach to crowning the world 's most romantic cities			1
because while a romantic city should grab hold of your heart , it should n't stop there			1
sure , there 's an element of magic to a romantic city , but that magic is supposed to beget love or at least the making thereof			1
and these cities are municipal viagra			1
@entity57 , @entity58 place : this former @entity61 colony on the @entity62 offers all of the ornate architecture , rich food and freely flowing booze of @entity18 , without the @entity66			1
but belying the carefree geniality of its gumbo of assorted peoples is a dark mantle of sinful abandon and occult worship that makes the @entity57 colorful , crass and occasionally creepy			1
7 under - the - radar cultural destinations people : once the fifth - largest city in @entity76 , @entity57 has been content for decades to rest on its leisure laurels , promoting an atmosphere of laissez faire inhibition that provokes many visitors to spontaneous fits of nudity			1
things : the charm , fun and filth of the @entity90 ; the mist and mystery of the bayou ; the pomp and botany of the @entity96 ; the majesty of the mighty @entity62			1
@entity98 , @entity99 place : @entity101 included on lists of romantic things : fear			2
but it 's an exciting feeling all the same , just one among many aroused in the former capital of communism			1
it 's all here : the derelict and the opulent , the authoritarian and the lawless , the oligarchic and the proletarian			2
generations of strife and triumph abound : a @entity119 palace beside a @entity121 square beside a capitalist @entity122			2
people : loving is romantic but fighting can be too , and @entity98 are historically adroit at both			2
for those who find romance in power , there 's always plenty on display , as well as a notorious live - for - today attitude that has yet to find the envelope			1
things : the intellectual arousal of its late night bookstores ; the metamorphosed grandeur of @entity140 ; old factories and warehouses transformed into galleries , clubs and performance spaces ; countless monuments to lovers ; vanishing vestiges of the @entity150 era			2
@entity151 , @entity152 place : you know what 's romantic ? a beach			2
you know what 's not romantic ? barf - discharging college kids , shrill children ( shrilldren ? ) and sunburnt albinos in socks and sandals , making coastal mainstays like @entity165 , @entity166 and the @entity167 as enchanting as hair on soap			2
there 's nothing more romantic than being as far from other people as possible , and no other capital city offers this kind of isolation with this kind of beachfront			1
travel on the cheap : 5 times to go plus , the architecture of this former @entity183 colony often mimics that of its former empire			1
it 's like they put @entity188 somewhere good			2
people : it 's 80 degrees ( 27 c ) almost every day of the year -- warm and cool enough to keep clothes and sweating respectively minimal			2
things : the transcendence of its pristine beaches ; the prehistoric beauty of @entity198 ( the reputed original @entity199 ) ; the eroticism of moutya dancing , which increases as the rhythm quickens			2
@entity203 , @entity204 place : assimilating generations of native @entity204 , @entity208 expats and @entity210 and @entity211 immigrants , @entity203 is a petri dish of fiery @entity214 and @entity215 culture			1
but , contrasting their showier @entity220 brethren to the north , the flash and passion of @entity218 simmers without boiling over , yielding a city renowned as much for art and architecture as it is for spherical backsides			2
people : porteños are an amorous lot , with some of that @entity18 poutiness , only supplemented by actionable desire			1
it 's a sentiment that often transfers osmotically to visiting tourists			0
things : the electrostatic sensuality generated by tango -- watched or danced ; the lawns full of frisky youth at @entity239 ; the unparalleled showcase for the city 's passion and potency that is soccer at @entity244			0
also : always order the steak			0
@entity246 , @entity247 place : the canals of @entity19			0
even if you do n't partake of the @entity257 capital 's approved vices , there 's a romance that accompanies the freedom to do so			1
you know what 's not romantic ? bus fumes			0
which is why anything in this city is accessible by boat , bike or boot			0
people : the town is to professionals what @entity272 and @entity273 are to amateurs , offering at the front door the sex and drugs everyone else keeps in back			0
amsterdammers are the sinful world 's grown - ups			0
things : the titillation of women twisting in the windows of the @entity288 ; the puritanical eye of the @entity288 's carnal storm that is @entity291 ( " old church " ) ; 10 p.m. summer sunsets ; a kiss under the @entity295 ( " skinny bridge " ) , ensuring fidelity			0
@entity298 , @entity299 place : think old stuff is romantic ? well , it 's still 1959 in the capital of @entity299 , where the development -- and commercialism -- of the outside world has yet to sneak past the bouncers			1
the resultant sensations of risk and antiquity in this forbidden time warp make romance unavoidable			0
so if you ever wanted to have sex in the 1950s , here 's your chance -- but time 's running out			0
7 ways to go local while traveling people : just about everyone in @entity298 is an artist of some kind , underscored by live music -- and dancing -- everywhere			0
while not as outwardly sexual as some @entity326 capitals , this populace is as carnal as they come			0
things : the bars ' n ' cigars of @entity332 's @entity298 ; the intimacy of dinner at an in - home paladar ; the unspoiled virginity of the @entity337 ; the fear - and awe - inspiring @entity338			0
@entity339 , @entity211 place : if having nowhere to be is your idea of romance , the capital of @entity342 wins on two counts : it 's easy to get happily lost and no one wakes up until 8 p.m. like @entity349 or @entity350 , @entity339 is dense , cultured and cosmopolitan , and is also a beach town , offering fickle lovers a broad romantic spectrum			1
one avenue that 's no longer available to paramours ? public nudity			0
it was finally -- in some cases , mercifully -- banned in 2011			0
people : trend - centric , cocksure , proud and partying , @entity361 will steal your heart if not your wallet			0
things : the weird feeling in one 's pants upon beholding @entity370 architecture ; the corpuscle of seemingly endless branching alleyways housing the galleries , cafés , bars , restaurants and museums of the @entity379 neighborhood			0
no two trips are ever alike			0
@entity18 , @entity61 place : ok			1
hard as it is to admit , even the laziest " romantic cities " lists are right -- the @entity384 is still among earth 's most enchanting municipalities			0
@entity18 is an urban engineering conundrum : its architecture all differs vastly , yet simultaneously adheres to a singular , uniform vision , making the world 's most visited city also probably its most beautiful			1
there , we said it			0
people : @entity397 , self - righteous , indolent , aloof , tempestuous , hot			0
the contemptibility of @entity66 is exceeded only by the self - hatred among those of us who lust for them			1
things : the stupid views of the entire city from @entity406 ; the lousy majesty of the @entity408 ; the crummy uplifting @entity409 of " @entity410 's " ; the idiot engineering marvel of the @entity412 ; the rotten eroticism of @entity414 ; the insufferable grandeur of the @entity416			0
