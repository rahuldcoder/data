-- @entity1 could n't cut it as a successful @entity4 owner			1
his business , the @entity6 , was failing			0
he needed a scapegoat , and he blamed @entity8 , his most loyal customer base			0
apparently , he forgot those fans are the only group that has stuck by him in spite of the inferior product he 's put on the basketball court since he took over the team 11 years ago			1
he should be grateful any fans showed up for the games at all			2
his first mistake , among many , has been forgetting that @entity6 have been barely a smidgen above mediocre for as long as any sports fan can remember			2
@entity22 is dull ; the overpriced concession food is awful			0
and no matter what anyone says about " @entity26 , " football ( college first and then @entity29 ) will always be king in that city			0
so if you are going to invest in the @entity6 of the @entity4 , a league that boasts the highest share of black television viewers , at 45 % -- three times higher than the @entity29 or @entity37 basketball -- and a player roster that is nearly 80 % black , well , then you better have a smart business strategy to keep your core customers happy and attract corporate dollars at the same time			1
what we know @entity1 , it seems , had no winning strategy			2
the " self - reporting " bigot seems to have awakened one day , looked around the @entity26 ( which according to the 2010 census is 54 % @entity8 and 38.4 % white ) and decided that all of his business failures in @entity26 had nothing to do with his own mismanagement of the team			1
he then sent a racist , ranting email to his business partners , outlining his personal theories about how their failing franchise might be turned around			2
@entity1 has apologized for his tirade and said he will sell his controlling interest in the team			1
" i wrote an e-mail two years ago that was inappropriate and offensive , " @entity1 said in a @entity6 news release			2
" i trivialized our fans by making cliched assumptions about their interests ( i.e. , hip hop vs. country , white vs. black cheerleaders , etc. ) and by stereotyping their perceptions of one another ( i.e. , that white fans might be afraid of our black fans )			0
by focusing on race , i also sent the unintentional and hurtful message that our white fans are more valuable than our black fans			0
" but i take his apology with a large grain of salt			0
though his rambling email was incoherent and ill - advised , in hindsight at least , it reads as though it is the words of a man speaking from his heart			2
in fact , it turns out @entity1 's decision to sell his interest in the team was triggered by the discovery of his inflammatory email by an outside law firm reviewing the organization , according to @entity0 reports			1
in professional sports and in business , winning is everything			0
and when @entity1 and his partners realized that the arena was half - empty , the first questions @entity1 should have asked are : will sports fans pay money to watch this team play ? and what are my successful competitors doing to attract more customers ? well , according to the @entity6 website , the average ticket price is $ 103 per game , and the average fan and corporate packages run from $ 599 to $ 4,499 per season			1
i 'm not sure about @entity1 , but i could definitely find a better way to spend my hard - earned cash and my time than driving to an arena to watch a losing team			1
@entity1 's downtown pro sports neighbors , the @entity120 , are certainly having no problem thriving in an urban environment where it is necessary to court @entity8 - @entity8 customers			1
the @entity120 , who have posted five consecutive winning seasons , including four trips to the playoffs , sell out nearly every game , and they do so in part because they intentionally put a smart strategy in place to attract their @entity8 - @entity8 fanbase			0
successful teams across sports in cities like @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 are using this same multicultural business strategy to run winning franchises			0
@entity1 is now getting undeserved credit for reportedly going first to the @entity4 to confess that he sent the racist email before it was exposed			1
the league , to its credit , in the wake of the @entity148 disaster , had been vetting other team owners who fostered climates of discrimination and bigotry behind closed doors			0
therefore , clearly , @entity1 had a compelling reason to come clean about his 2 - year - old email			1
opinion : @entity1 and the @entity6 ' real problem @entity148 was forced to sell the @entity158 over the summer when racist audio recordings came to light			2
he defended himself then , saying that he was not the only @entity4 owner to harbor prejudice attitudes			1
and there 's no arguing that he was right			0
despite its leading record in the sports industry on diversity hiring , both on and off the court , the @entity4 is no stranger to the controversial topic of race in sports			2
it is ironic that @entity1 , touted as a public do - gooder , has missed his own message of tolerance and understanding			1
this year , he took his @entity4 team the @entity181 museum in @entity138			1
the players even met @entity1 's mother - in - law , @entity183 , a concentration camp survivor			1
@entity1 said then : " having them come here and having them see the faces of bigotry and hate , it 's important			1
for them to learn lessons of this museum and of the @entity181 means a lot to me			0
" tolerance is a pretty word we like to use			0
but in real life , it takes courage , humility and commitment to live by it			0
whether the topic is homophobia , gender equality or religious intolerance , @entity1 certainly is not the first person whose public actions have fallen short of their private hearts			1
but @entity1 's brand of public hypocrisy is not just morally corrupt , it is bad for business			1
and the @entity4 is big business			2
thanks to strong leaders like @entity4 commissioner @entity218 and his predecessor @entity219 , who have implemented tough love but racial compassion , the league has not only preached but mostly practiced racial tolerance			2
it 's a smart strategy because without @entity8 fans , and the talented men who play the game , there is no league			0
and today , the best companies are looking for a way to diversify and grow their customer base			0
i say good riddance to @entity1 and other @entity4 owners like him , of which i think there are few			1
and kudos to @entity218 and others who are working to root out racist owners			0
" as mr. @entity1 acknowledged , the views he expressed are entirely unacceptable and are in stark contrast to the core principles of the @entity4 , " @entity218 said in a statement sunday			1
call me overly optimistic , but i believe that most @entity4 owners are decent people			2
and more important , they are shrewd businessmen who understand that in today 's global economy , a company that does n't not have the cultural intelligence to build a diverse customer base will fail			0
in 1903 , @entity250 poignantly wrote in " @entity251 , " " for the problem of the @entity253 is the problem of the color - line			0
" and today , as @entity258 's face shifts from white to shades of brown , it remains to be seen whether we will ever stop stumbling over that line , fearing the line , hating that line , so we can finally stand together as one strong nation .			0

@entity267 : @entity1 's email revealed @entity4 owner scapegoating blacks
she says he thought profits low because too many blacks at games , but team is mediocre
@entity278 : this bigot gets no points for " self - reporting " ; he 's selling interest under pressure
@entity278 : @entity1 touted as public do - gooder but is a hypocrite
