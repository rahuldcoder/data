@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 apologized friday to the family of @entity5 , the unarmed @entity7 - @entity6 teen that he shot in a confrontation that riveted a nation and sparked intense discussions about race , racial profiling and gun laws			1
@entity3 spoke moments before a @entity1 judge set a $ 150,000 bond that will let him get out of jail while he awaits trial			2
" i wanted to say i am sorry for the loss of your son , " @entity3 said in an unusual appeal directly to @entity5 's family before he testified in the @entity22 in @entity0			1
" i thought he was a little bit younger than i was , and i did not know if he was armed or not			0
" @entity3 's attorney , @entity28 , said after the hearing that his client was responding to an interview in which @entity5 's mother , @entity32 , said she wanted to hear from the man who shot her son			1
" he did n't want to defend himself , he did n't want to discuss the facts of the case			0
he heard the request of the family , and he wanted to respond to it , " @entity28 said , adding that an attempt to apologize to the family in private was rebuffed			0
attorneys for @entity5 's family , however , called the apology a self - serving act by a man facing a life prison sentence if convicted of the second - degree murder charge against him			1
" this was the most disingenuous , insulting thing i 've ever seen , " said @entity5 family attorney @entity49			1
@entity5 's parents were " completely devastated " over the decision to allow @entity3 to post bond and eventually go free , attorney @entity51 said			1
prosecutors had asked that @entity3 remain in jail without bond or that judge @entity57 set bond at $ 1 million -- an amount @entity28 said the family would be unable to handle			2
assistant state attorney @entity60 said @entity3 's prior run - ins with a police officer and a woman who named him in a domestic violence injunction show that he is violent and a threat to the community			2
@entity57 , however , described the incidents as " run of the mill " and " somewhat mild " in approving @entity28 's request for bond			0
with the 10 % cash payment customarily made to secure bond , @entity3 could be freed with $ 15,000 from his family , attorneys said			1
he will likely remain in jail for at least a couple of days while his attorneys and authorities work out terms of his release , which also include electronic monitoring and other restrictions , @entity28 said			2
the judge told @entity28 to talk to authorities about his request to allow @entity3 to leave @entity1 while awaiting trial			2
@entity28 said he is concerned about threats to @entity3 's safety , as well as that of his family			1
@entity89 said no decision has been made on whether to allow @entity3 to leave the state			0
the decision to grant @entity3 bond followed a hearing in which his wife and parents testified that he was a caring , nonviolent man			0
" i know that he is very protective of people , very protective of homeless people and also of children , " @entity97 testified by telephone			0
she said her son helped organize a campaign to " get justice " for a homeless man who had been beaten in @entity0 , where he lived and where the shooting of @entity5 took place			2
he also ventured into a dangerous @entity111 neighborhood twice a week to mentor a 14 - year - old african - american boy , his mother said			0
she testified that she begged him not to go because of the danger			0
" he said , ' @entity115 , if i do n't go , they do n't have nobody , ' " she said			0
@entity117 : @entity3 wife talks publicly for the first time @entity3 's father , @entity120 , testified that his son is not a violent man despite previous incidents discussed by @entity124 during the hearing , including a scuffle with a police officer and a dispute with a woman			1
" i 've never known him to be violent at all unless he was provoked , and then he would turn the other cheek , " @entity120 testified			0
according to authorities , @entity3 has said he killed @entity5 in self - defense after the teenager accosted him , knocking him to the ground and bashing his head against the concrete			1
@entity3 's father testified friday that when he saw his son the day after @entity5 's shooting , he was wearing a protective cover over his nose , his face was swollen , and he had two vertical gashes on his head			1
he also reportedly suffered a broken nose			0
timeline of case @entity5 's family and the special prosecutor appointed to investigate the case have rejected that argument , saying they believe @entity3 disobeyed the instructions of a police dispatcher to stop following @entity5 , racially profiled him and unjustly killed him			1
although details of the shooting remain murky , what is known is that @entity5 ventured out from the home of his father 's fiancee in @entity0 and went to a nearby convenience store , where he bought a bag of @entity161 and an @entity162			1
on his way back , he had a confrontation with @entity3 , who shot him			0
@entity3 had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood , according to authorities			2
in the call , @entity3 said he was following @entity5 after the teen started to run , prompting the dispatcher to tell him , " we do n't need you to do that			1
" @entity3 pursued @entity5 anyway			1
after briefly losing track of the teen , @entity3 told authorities the teen approached him and the two exchanged words			1
@entity3 said he reached for his cell phone , then @entity5 punched him in the nose			1
@entity3 said @entity5 pinned him down and began slamming his head onto the sidewalk , leading to the shooting			1
@entity1 to review ' stand your ground ' law police have said @entity3 was not immediately charged because there was no evidence to disprove his account that he had acted in self - defense			0
a police report indicated he was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head			0
in friday 's hearing , an investigator for special prosecutor @entity197 's office said authorities have no evidence showing who started the altercation that led to @entity5 's death			1
" do i know ? no , " investigator @entity204 said when asked if he knew who started the fight			2
he said wounds on the back of @entity3 's head were consistent with his skull being struck with something harder than his skull , and said under questioning from @entity28 that the object could have been a concrete sidewalk			2
but he said evidence in the case is not consistent with @entity3 's account that he was able to move away from the sidewalk just before being shot			2
@entity5 was shot once in the chest at close range , @entity204 said			0
@entity89 declined to comment on most of friday 's proceedings , including @entity3 's testimony			2
but he said there 's more to come when the case comes to trial			0
" we obviously have evidence we feel we can go forward with , " he said			0
" we did not put our entire case on today			0
" @entity51 said @entity5 's father , @entity228 , wept through much of friday hearing , and the family was distraught at the prospect of @entity3 being able to reunite with his family			1
" they pray that his freedom is only temporary , because the pain he has caused this family is going to be permanent , " @entity51 said			0
@entity2 's @entity237 contributed to this report .			0
