-- an @entity1 convicted of being an @entity3 operative was resentenced to life in prison monday in a @entity7 courtroom after an appeals court ruled his 30 - year prison sentence was too lenient			1
@entity10 , seated far left , appears in an artist 's rendering of a march 2005 court hearing			1
@entity10 , a native of @entity14 , @entity7 , was convicted in november 2005 of conspiring with @entity3 and involvement in a possible plot to assassinate then - president @entity17			1
a federal appeals court , however , ruled the lower court did not sentence @entity10 harshly enough and that its deviance from federal sentencing guidelines was unjustified			1
" the defendant sought to destabilize our government and to shake it to its core , " according to the 2008 ruling			0
" to this day , he wishes he had succeeded			0
... it is not too much to ask that a sentencing proceeding not lose sight of the immensity and scale of wanton harm that was and remains @entity10 's plain and clear intention			0
" @entity10 was resentenced to life in prison , federal prosecutors told @entity0 on monday			2
in june 2003 , @entity38 authorities detained @entity10 in @entity39 , where he was participating in religious studies			2
during his 20 - month detention in @entity38 , he confessed to being a member of @entity3 and to discussing the execution of a number of terrorist plots , including one to assassinate @entity17			1
prosecutors offered no evidence that those discussions morphed into a specific plan			0
however , they maintained that @entity10 discussed boarding a @entity1 - bound plane from @entity51 or @entity52 and flying it into targets on the @entity1 @entity54			2
@entity10 's attorneys argued that his confessions were false and obtained through torture in @entity38 before he was transported to the @entity1 in february 2005			1
at his 2006 sentencing , @entity10 faced a sentence of 20 years to life , and prosecutors maintained that " only a life sentence will protect the citizens of the @entity1 from the defendant attacking again			1
" but @entity1 district judge @entity65 rejected that claim , saying there was no evidence @entity10 took any steps within the @entity1 to further the conspiracies			2
in sentencing @entity10 , @entity65 quoted extensively from letters he received from his friends , family and others endorsing @entity10 's character			0
but the appeals court said it was unmoved			0
" what person of ' good character ' aims to destroy thousands of fellow human beings beings who are innocent of any transgressions against him ? this is not good character as we understand it , and to allow letters of this sort to provide the basis for such a substantial variance would be to deprive ' good character ' of all its content			0
" @entity10 's 30 - year sentence was to be followed by 30 years of supervised release			1
