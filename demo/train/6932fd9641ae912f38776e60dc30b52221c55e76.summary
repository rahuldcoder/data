@entity0 , @entity1 -- free trade , transparency and a crackdown on tax cheats will be at the heart of @entity11 's @entity10 presidency , prime minister @entity3 told the @entity12 in @entity0 on thursday as he set out his vision for a more competitive @entity14			1
the speech comes a day after @entity3 made headlines by promising the @entity11 people a vote on @entity20 membership if he wins the next general election in 2015			1
" we need more free trade			1
we need fairer tax systems			0
we need more transparency on how governments -- and yes , companies -- operate , " @entity3 told political and business leaders at @entity0			1
these three issues will be the focus of the @entity10 meeting to be hosted by @entity11 later this year , he said			1
@entity3 said the @entity20 and the @entity10 -- made up of @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity11 and the @entity38 -- all face the " looming , insistent question " of how to compete and succeed in the global economic race			1
he sees free trade as key to that success , saying that when it is n't free , everyone suffers			1
he wants @entity11 to be outward - looking , @entity3 said , as he insisted that his referendum promise was " not about turning our backs on @entity14 " but about making the 27 - member bloc work for everyone			1
" let 's negotiate a new settlement for @entity14 that works for the @entity11 and then let 's get fresh consent for it			2
it 's not just right for the @entity11			2
it 's necessary for @entity14 , " he said			0
" @entity14 is being out - competed and out - invested -- and it 's time we make it an engine for growth , not a source of cost for business and complaint for our citizens			0
" ' shape the future ' with this in mind , @entity3 told @entity2 's @entity74 that he has no regrets over the referendum promise , despite unhappiness among some @entity14 partners			1
" it 's really important that we 've set out a plan for how we get change in @entity14 that will benefit all of @entity14 , making it more open , more competitive , more flexible , and how we secure @entity11 's place within that , " he said			2
" i think it 's a very important step forward and i 'm pleased with the reception that the speech has got from the business community , from the public , and also some positive responses from some of my @entity14 colleagues in government , too			0
" as for those who have criticized the decision , @entity3 said he believes " the greatest gamble for @entity11 would be to sit back and do nothing			1
" the @entity20 is already changing to meet the needs of the 17 members who are part of the euro single currency , he said			0
@entity11 is not in that group			2
" it 's much better in my view to step forward to shape that debate , to shape the future in @entity14 , " he said			0
@entity11 's desire to renegotiate the terms of its @entity20 membership is based on the need to gain the consent of the people as they follow a path within @entity14 , he said			2
far from being isolationist , @entity11 is a " very positive player " in the @entity20 , @entity3 added			1
in addition to helping create the single market , it has been one of the nations that pushed for the oil embargo on @entity121 and tough sanctions on @entity123 , and it has become a key backer in recent days of @entity33 's military action in @entity127 , he said			0
asked about the recent wrangling in the @entity38 over the fiscal cliff , @entity3 suggested that @entity38 could learn from @entity11 , although he recognizes that every country 's circumstances are different			1
" i would say our experience in the @entity11 is that you can take people with you as you take those difficult decisions , but ... it 's a very tough and hard road , but it 's a road we all have to travel , " he said			2
" in the end , we all have to prove that we can pay our way in the world , that our credit is good , and all the rest of it			0
it 's not the only way that you will get growth ; it is part of what we need to bring the world economy back to healthy growth			0
" @entity3 said the biggest thing that @entity11 and @entity38 could do together is to work on an @entity20 - @entity38 trade deal			1
" between us , we account for a third of world trade , so if we really got together and liberalized trade between the @entity20 and the @entity38 , we could make both our peoples a lot better off , " he said			1
' ethical issues ' addressing policymakers in @entity0 , @entity3 said the questions of fairer taxes , more open trade and greater transparency apply just as much to the developed countries of the @entity10 as to poorer nations			1
and he dismissed the idea that speaking out on the issue of taxes and transparency made him anti-capitalism or anti-business			2
poor practice by some firms has an impact on those that play by the rules , he said			0
there is a difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance , he added , " but there are some forms of avoidance ( that ) have become so aggressive that i think it is right to say these raise ethical issues , and it 's time to call for more responsibility and for governments to act accordingly			0
" " i 'm a ' low tax ' conservative but i 'm not a ' companies should pay no tax ' conservative , " added @entity3 , who heads @entity11 's @entity187			1
meanwhile , transparency about the flow of money is key to poorer countries moving from poverty to growth , @entity3 said			1
" like everything else in this @entity10 , the ambitions are big , and i make no apology for that , " he said			2
" we can be the generation that eradicates absolute poverty in our world , " he said , but only if leaders focus on the cause , not the symptoms			1
@entity2 's @entity209 said @entity3 's attempt to go after tax cheats could be seen as good populist politics and an easy shot as he tries to distract from other matters			2
no cherry - picking on wednesday , @entity3 promised that if his party wins the 2015 general election , the country would get to vote on whether @entity11 stays in the @entity20 on the basis of a renegotiated deal , or leaves			1
the referendum should not be held until it 's clear how changes made after the crisis in the eurozone works out , he said , but will be held in the first half of the next parliament			0
the long - awaited speech was met with approval by those in his party who want to see @entity11 get some powers back from the @entity20 , as well as a reduction in legislation they say holds back businesses			2
but critics -- including his party 's coalition partner , the @entity236 -- say now is not the time to create uncertainty among businesses and industry over @entity11 's future in the @entity20			0
it is also unclear whether the other 26 members of the @entity20 would be willing to renegotiate the terms of @entity11 's membership			0
@entity33 and others have made it clear that the @entity11 leader can not " cherry - pick " which elements of the @entity20 he signs up to , or risk unraveling the union to suit @entity11 interests			0
@entity38 president @entity254 has also said that " the @entity38 values a strong @entity11 in a strong @entity20			1
" but @entity34 chancellor @entity255 gave @entity3 some room for maneuver , indicating she is open to discussions on a " fair compromise			0
" she is also due to give a speech thursday at @entity0 , the annual forum that this year is attended by nearly 40 world leaders and more than 2,000 executives			0
@entity35 prime minister @entity265 , speaking at @entity264 , predicted @entity11 would remain in the @entity20			0
" i am confident that if there is to be a referendum one day , the @entity11 citizens will decide to stay in the @entity20 and contribute to shape its future , " he said			2
he added , however , " i think the @entity20 does not need unwilling @entity14			0
" @entity11 is a net contributor to the @entity20 and an important player in the single market , which may give @entity3 some additional sway			1
but critics warn he is taking a big gamble			0
former @entity277 prime minister @entity276 , who leads the @entity278 in the @entity279 , warned against trying " hold the @entity20 to ransom			0
" @entity2 's @entity281 reported from @entity0 , and @entity282 from @entity283			0

new : @entity3 says the @entity38 could learn from @entity11 on *deficit* reduction
he tells @entity74 he has no regrets over promising a referendum
he says the @entity10 will focus on free trade , fairer taxes and greater transparency "
we can be the generation that eradicates absolute poverty in our world , " he says
