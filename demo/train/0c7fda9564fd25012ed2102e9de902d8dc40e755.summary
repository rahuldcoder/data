-- international criticism swiftly and robustly censured the decision by @entity4 prime minister @entity3 to block access to social networking website @entity7			1
@entity9 vice president @entity8 called the ban " groundless , pointless , cowardly " and the @entity11 likened it to " 21st century book burning			0
" but @entity3 is less concerned about what the " international community says " and more determined to stem the seemingly unstoppable leaking of illicit audio recordings posted on @entity7 and @entity17 , allegedly documenting corruption in the highest echelons of the @entity4 government , ahead of next sunday 's municipal elections			1
@entity7 is gaining popularity in @entity4 as a forum for unhindered debate and information at the expense of traditional sources of news			2
it played a critical role in mobilizing opposition to @entity3 during last summer 's @entity32 protests			2
and no wonder -- media freedom in @entity4 has plummeted from 98th to 154th position worldwide since 2006 , according to @entity36			2
publicity surrounding the @entity7 ban notwithstanding , one should be careful not to exaggerate the near term impacts of this policy move			2
research company @entity41 estimates that a mere 15 % of @entity4 citizens are @entity7 users			1
this statistic suggests that @entity7 use is limited to a small segment of tech - savvy and globally - connected @entity4 -- a fact that partly explains why they had the technical acumen to circumvent the ban and actually boosted @entity7 usage by 33 % , as revealed by social media rating agency @entity52			1
more broadly , the vast majority of the @entity3 's core supporters -- religious and conservative @entity4 -- are probably not avid @entity7 fans			1
their main concern is not media freedom or the pervasiveness of corruption but bread - and - butter economic issues			0
@entity62 , a political scientist at @entity64 - based @entity63 , notes that popular perceptions of the state of the economy have not deteriorated significantly implying that while @entity3 may lose some votes , he is likely to largely retain his base of support in @entity4 's upcoming elections			1
opinion : @entity7 ban is the least of @entity4 's woes what the @entity7 ban indicates is that the @entity4 leadership psychology is incapable of tackling effectively the myriad serious political , economic and external challenges facing the country			1
it does not appear inclined to implement structural and liberalizing reforms to prevent a " middle income trap " -- in other words a slow growth regime -- from taking hold			0
as i argued in a recent @entity88 report , in the absence of these reforms @entity4 growth rates of 3 % or lower will become the norm rather than the exception			2
@entity4 is addicted to continuous flows of fickle global capital and external debt to fund private consumption			0
its economy suffers from persistently high current account deficits , meaning that imports vastly outpace exports and can not be paid for by the low levels of domestic savings			0
unwisely , @entity4 's focus on hubristic construction projects such as the third @entity64 airport and its capricious use of the law to suppress @entity7 , rather than competitiveness and innovation , will most likely further undermine future business plans and -- critically -- the confidence of foreign investors			1
@entity4 's brand , which was on the rise during the first decade of this century , has witnessed a formidable hammering in the @entity115 and @entity116			0
very few in the region now look to @entity4 as an inspiration for liberal politics and open markets			0
@entity122 has primarily supplanted @entity4 on the consolidation of democracy , despite the latter 's six decades of electoral experience			0
@entity4 is a vivid illustration that personality - based top - down governance and fragile institutions are not a recipe for political maturity and lasting economic success			0
this strategically - located nation of 76 million people demonstrates the time - honored principle that " absolute power corrupts absolutely " and reinforces @entity138 's dictum that " democracy is the worst form of government , except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time			0

@entity4 pm @entity3 blocked @entity4 internet users ' access to @entity7
move was widely condemned around the world , @entity7 users in @entity4 *flouted* the ban
@entity148 : @entity3 keen to stem *damaging* leaks ahead of local elections in @entity4
@entity148 : @entity162 risks scaring off investors , which could hurt @entity3 politically
