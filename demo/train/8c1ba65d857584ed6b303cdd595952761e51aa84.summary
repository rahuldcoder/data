forty - five years after the @entity3 @entity4 struck down a ban on interracial marriage , the rate of marriage across racial and ethnic lines in the @entity3 is on the rise , according to a new study released thursday			1
and while such " intermarriages " continue to grow , so too does public acceptance of such unions , according to the study by the @entity14 's @entity13 project			1
the study has left social media sites abuzz with discussion			1
" why do people give inter-racial dating so much lip service ? " wrote @entity19 on @entity20			0
" you like who you like - black , white , blue , orange			2
" others were more reserved about what the report reflects			0
" i look forward to the day when stories about " inter-racial " marriages are no longer newsworthy , " wrote @entity30 on the micro-blogging site			2
" we have far to go			0
" about 15 % of new marriages in the @entity3 in 2010 were between spouses of different races or ethnicities , more than doubling the 1980 level of 6.7 % , according to the study			1
looking at all married couples in 2010 , regardless of when they married , so - called " intermarriages " reached an all - time high of 8.4 % in 2010 , compared to 3.2 % in 1980 , the study said			1
the study analyzed the demographic and characteristics of newlyweds who differ in race or ethnicity and compared them to couples of the same race or ethnicity			2
it defines newly weds as couples who married in the year prior to the survey date			0
among all newlyweds in 2010 , 9 % of whites married outside of their race or ethnicity , along with 17 % of african - americans , 26 % of @entity62 and 28 % of @entity63 -- a term that includes native @entity65 and @entity66			1
gender patterns in intermarriages vary widely , the study found			1
about 24 % of @entity71 males married outside their race in 2010 , compared to 9 % of @entity71 females			2
however , the reverse is true for @entity63 , where about 36 % of females married outside their race compared to 17 % of male newlyweds			0
and intermarriages for white and @entity62 people do not vary by gender , researchers found			2
@entity82 also vary by region			0
in western states , about one in five people , or 22 % , married someone of a different race or ethnicity between 2008 and 2010			2
that drops to 14 % in the @entity90 , 13 % in the @entity91 and 11 % in the @entity92			0
interracial dating services have also cropped up online , offering those looking for love an opportunity to find their preferred matches			2
a white man identified as @entity100 on the website " @entity102 , " said that he saw who would turn out to be his future wife online			0
" be bold , ladies , " said @entity105 , an @entity71 - @entity71 woman and @entity100 's wife , according to the website			2
" have patience , and then have nerve when that patience pays off ! " because whites are by far the nation 's largest racial group , marriage between whites and minorities were the most common type of intermarriage , even though the intermarriage rate for whites is relatively low compared to other races or ethnicities , the study said			1
the state where most intermarriages took place was @entity127 , where more than four in 10 newlyweds ( 42.4 % ) were intermarried			1
the next highest percentages were in @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , with 26.3 % , 25.6 % and 25.4 % , respectively			0
comparing those who " married out " to those who " married in , " researchers found the median combined earnings of both groups were similar			0
in one in five marriages of each group , both spouses were college graduates			2
in both groups , people tended to marry someone of a similar age , with a two - to three - year age gap between husband and wife			0
additionally , equal numbers were marrying for the first time			0
however , there were some differences			0
white / asian newlywed couples had significantly higher median combined annual earnings , at $ 70,592 , than any other pairing			0
and " when it comes to educational characteristics , more than half of white newlyweds who marry @entity63 have a college degree , compared with roughly a third of white newlyweds who married whites , " the study said			0
hispanic or african - americans who married whites tended to have higher educational attainment compared to marriages within their own race or ethnic group			1
couples formed between an @entity172 man and a white wife topped the median combined earnings list for the period studied , between 2008 and 2010 , with about $ 71,800 , the study said			1
" during this person , white male newlyweds who married @entity172 , @entity62 or black spouses had higher combined earnings than did white male newlyweds who married a white spouse			0
" several studies using government data have found overall divorce rates are higher for couples who " married out , " the @entity14 said , " but here , too , the patterns vary by the racial and gender characteristics of the couples			0
meanwhile , about 43 % of @entity3 said they believe more intermarriages is a change for the better within society , while only about one in 10 said it was a change for the worse , the @entity14 said			1
" being a minority , younger , more educated , liberal and living in the @entity196 or @entity197 states are all traits associated with those who think more positively about intermarriage , " according to the study			1
more than one - third of adults surveyed said an immediate family member or close relatives is married to someone of a different race , the study said			1
and nearly two - thirds , or 63 % , said they would have no problem with a family member marrying someone outside their own racial or ethnic group			1
in a 1986 survey , nearly three in 10 @entity3 said intermarriage was not acceptable for anyone , and 37 % said it might be acceptable for others , but not for themselves			1
only one - third of the public said it was acceptable for everyone in the 1986 poll			0
the study is primarily based on the @entity14 's analysis of data from the @entity228 's @entity227 in 2008 - 2010 and on three nationwide telephone surveys , the study said .			1
