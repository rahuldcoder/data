-- @entity1 , the @entity3 president who will sit with @entity5 president @entity4 on monday to discuss the state — and the fate -- of secretary of state @entity9 's peace process is a good man and most likely the best partner for peace negotiations that @entity14 , this @entity13 government or any other is likely to have			1
he 's rational , enlightened and a leader who eschews both violence and the dream that somehow , sometime , the armed struggle , or demography will deliver @entity3 their state			1
but there 's only one pesky problem : under current circumstances , he can not deliver his side of a comprehensive peace agreement with @entity13			1
the @entity3 consensus @entity1 is in a bind			1
he 's trapped by traditional @entity3 negotiating positions and a narrative that is almost impossible to alter			1
these positions include : june 1967 borders with minor territorial adjustments , a capital in @entity34 , security arrangements that do n't suck every bit of sovereignty out of @entity3 statehood , and an acceptable answer to the question of what to do about the volatile issue of " right of return			1
" to diverge significantly from them would end his political viability and perhaps his life			0
even the late @entity3 leader @entity52 — whose power , authority and legitimacy conferred some discretion and flexibility -- would n't agree to anything short of this consensus			1
i once heard @entity52 remark , at the @entity59 : you wo n't walk behind my coffin			1
and @entity1 has little of @entity52 's street cred			2
he is head of the @entity63 , and the @entity65 's executive committee , but is master of none			0
not enough urgency the idea that you could reconcile this @entity3 consensus with @entity73 's bottom lines — assuming you could identify them -- is fantastical			1
and his self - image is not to become the midwife or father of a @entity3 state based on @entity1 ' requirements or needs ; it is to water them down with @entity5 help			1
even then the idea that he 's prepared to yield to @entity1 on borders or @entity34 is highly improbable			1
the history of peacemaking on the @entity13 side is , to be sure , a history of transformed hawks ( see @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 )			0
but @entity73 is different , and circumstances have changed			2
the region is in turmoil , and @entity100 is his real priority			0
there is neither enough pain nor prospect of gain for him to urgently make this deal			0
divided @entity3 @entity108 has been greatly weakened			2
the ouster of @entity116 's @entity115 , @entity111 prime minister @entity110 's troubles and @entity108 ' need to distance itself from @entity113 have blocked its options			0
but , between @entity119 and @entity108 , the @entity3 national movement is still badly divided and resembles a kind of @entity3 @entity121 : there are two of everything : statelets , security services , patrons , constitutions and visions of what @entity130 is and even where it is			2
the real problem is that any reconciliation of the two factions will likely further harden @entity3 positions , creating a " tradeoff " : internal peace in the @entity3 ranks but more tension with @entity13 , and probably the @entity5 , too			2
and yet , unless the @entity3 find a way to assume control over the forces of violence in @entity130 -- in short , one authority and one gun -- it 's hard to see how @entity13 , even if it could be persuaded to withdraw from the @entity145 on paper , would ever do so in practice			2
the @entity4 administration understandably can not deal with the @entity108 issue now			2
instead , it seems to subscribe to the " @entity155 " school of diplomacy : if you build it , they will come			0
according to this logic , an agreement between @entity13 and the @entity63 would leave an already weakened @entity108 no choice but to put up or shut up			0
the only problem is that for that to work , the " it " that they build would have to be an agreement so compelling that the vast majority of @entity3 would rally around it			2
that 's very hard to see now			0
no help from @entity4 the president would like to be a historic peacemaker			0
and he made clear in his 2012 interview with @entity174 that he is very frustrated with prime minister @entity73			0
but to have a fight with this @entity13 prime minister over the possibility of a long - shot @entity13 - @entity3 deal does n't add up			1
a productive fight with @entity13 that ends up producing a historic peace deal where everyone wins is one thing			1
but right now that deal is nowhere in sight			0
indeed , right now @entity4 's priorities are @entity185 , @entity100 , preserving a domestic legacy and maintaining @entity188 control of the @entity189 in the upcoming midterm elections			1
he has little incentive or capacity to forcefully press @entity73 for a deal			2
people may think that a second - term president freed from the need for re-election is free to take a big gamble			0
but it has really never been the absence of political constraints as much as it is the presence of real opportunity that drives presidents			0
@entity4 does n't want to fail			2
no cause for alarm ? the odds of a conflict - ending agreement between @entity73 and @entity1 in which the core issues that drive the @entity13 - @entity3 conflict are resolved are slim to none			1
think outcomes , not solutions			0
but this is n't a cause for despair			0
@entity9 's relentlessness and skill in engaging the parties have created a process that will at least survive the @entity5 - imposed april deadline for a peace deal and live at least until year 's end			1
nobody wants to be blamed for the demise of the @entity9 process , and both @entity73 and @entity1 likely wonder -- and worry about -- what will happen if there is no process			1
@entity13 probably does n't have a @entity230 and @entity1 ' fallback -- to go to the @entity231 and rely on the international community and the @entity234 movement -- does n't offer much promise without @entity14 pressuring @entity13			2
and so @entity1 ' meeting at the @entity237 will go well enough			0
the president deeply cares about the @entity3 and their cause			0
and while @entity1 wo n't betray @entity3 positions for @entity4 's legacy , neither will he humiliate the president			1
@entity9 may yet squeeze out enough from the two sides to produce a piece of paper			0
in any event , it wo n't be the @entity3 who spoil the party			1
president @entity1 will almost certainly tell the president , paper or not , deadline be damned , let us continue the important work of @entity13 - @entity3 peacemaking			1
peace may not be around the corner , but more negotiations almost certainly are			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			0

@entity262 : @entity1 to meet with @entity4 , but he wo n't be able to deliver his side of peace deal
he says @entity1 backs off @entity3 negotiating points at his peril ; @entity73 wo n't yield
he says *fractious* @entity3 impede any deal , plus @entity4 taken up by @entity185 , midterms
@entity260 : parties do n't want to subvert @entity9 process , but @entity1 visit wo n't move needle
