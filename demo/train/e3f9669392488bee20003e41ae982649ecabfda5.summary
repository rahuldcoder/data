@entity0 , @entity1 -- humor was @entity5 's answer to helping revive @entity7 's @entity6 in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
born and raised in @entity6 , where the @entity10 of the @entity10 long stood as beacons over his street , @entity5 was awoken by his sister after the first plane had crashed into the @entity17			1
he grabbed his camera , caught a glimpse of the second plane before it hit the @entity22 and watched helplessly , as both towers collapsed			1
" i know that any one of us could have been there , " said @entity5 , who once worked inside the @entity22 's shopping mall before moving to another store , in an interview in @entity0 last month			1
as @entity7 struggled to recover , @entity6 -- about a 20 - minute walk from @entity30 -- turned into a ghost town			1
roads closed , deliveries stopped			0
" only residents , police everywhere , " @entity5 , now 42 , recalled			2
three - quarters of @entity6 workers -- nearly 25,000 -- were laid off , with the garment industry losing nearly $ 500 million in the year after the attacks , according to a 2002 report by the @entity41 of @entity7			1
one year later , more than 90 % of surveyed restaurants , garment factories and jewelry stores were anticipating " an inability to recover " to pre-september 11 business levels , the report said			2
chinatown shaken by ' double whammy ' and then in february 2003 , @entity49 , or @entity49 , hit @entity50			1
rumors flew , including an email hoax that @entity49 had hit @entity6 across the @entity53			1
no confirmed cases of @entity49 were found in @entity7 , but for @entity6 it was a " double whammy , " said @entity5 , who had served as a tour guide in @entity6 in addition to his job in retail			1
" again , no one went down to @entity6 to eat			2
" also not helping was the general state of the @entity53 economy , by then impacted by war in @entity66 as well as the run - up to the invasion of @entity69			1
with friends , @entity5 started " @entity71 , " a series of shows intended to revitalize nightlife in @entity6			1
as head of the @entity7 chapter of the @entity78 , @entity5 also organized a @entity80 ) rally in @entity6 , encouraging people to eat at their favorite @entity6 restaurants			1
@entity5 had first conceived of bringing comedy to @entity6 during a plane ride months earlier to see his ailing grandmother in @entity0			1

" @entity103 were typically stereotyped as lawyers , doctors and engineers -- but aside from @entity107 and @entity108 , where were the entertainers , @entity5 wondered			1
he quit his day job to dedicate himself to finding them			0
the 9/11 attacks were the catalyst for the shows in @entity6 , but @entity5 had found what he wanted to do for the rest of his life			1

@entity5 then launched a six - city national tour with @entity124 and a handful of other top @entity103 - @entity53 comedians , billing them " @entity130			1
" having made several trips to @entity0 over the years , he wondered why there had n't been a full - time comedy club there			1
@entity5 spent the next two years researching			2
besides @entity135 and @entity136 , where were the other local comedians ? as @entity5 put it : " who 's finding the next @entity135 ? " heading for @entity0 - and a new audience @entity5 left @entity7 to launch @entity0 's -- and what he says is also @entity50 's -- first full - time comedy club in 2007			1
the idea was to teach comedy and educate crowds more accustomed to @entity1 slapstick than @entity150 - language sarcasm			2
" @entity1 do n't get the sarcasm , " @entity5 said			2
" they 'll take things literally			0
you do n't blame them			0

by day , he is a self - employed web designer and developer			2
the group 's members give each other feedback , rewrite , refine and then perform in front of an audience , he said			2
@entity159 , a fan of @entity53 comedians and tv shows like " @entity182 " and " @entity183 , " said humor forced him to change his point of view , including dealing with sadness in the world			2
he credited @entity5 's @entity150 workshop for teaching him basics from holding the mic stand to writing jokes based on his observations and how others see him			1
" my @entity150 is so bad -- that 's why it 's so funny , " he quipped			0
by day , the 28 - year - old does data entry for a financial institution			0
then there is @entity199 ( " @entity200 " ) @entity201 , a 36 - year - old intellectual property attorney , who had also never done standup before @entity71			1
months after it opened , a friend suggested they try an open - mic night			0
the preparation paid off ; within days , they were enlisted to do weekend shows -- and then @entity71 's charity shows			1

and i went up and asked for a nametag			0

" @entity5 sees laughter as the glue that brings people together and the club as a way for people to boost confidence , creativity , self - esteem and public speaking			1
moreover , it 's a platform for talented people to get discovered , he pointed out			0
" i want to unite the world through laughter , " he said .			0
