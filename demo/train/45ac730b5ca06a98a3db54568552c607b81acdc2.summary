-- @entity1 became the first bowler to claim a hat - trick of dismissals in two @entity5 as his devastating spell of bowling helped @entity8 dismantle @entity9			1
@entity1 took six wickets for just 38 runs including three in three balls as he became the second bowler in as many days to record a hat - trick at the tournament after @entity18 ' paceman @entity17 's feat against @entity19 on monday			1
@entity9 had no answer to his fierce spell of bowling , capitulating to 142 all out in @entity23 before the hosts lost only one batsman as they recorded a nine wicket victory in just 18 overs			1
@entity9 captain @entity28 won the toss and elected to bat but openers @entity31 and @entity33 fell before eight runs were on the board			0
@entity36 and @entity37 steadied the ship and despite riding their luck both recorded half centuries as @entity9 edged to 102 - 2			0
@entity36 reached 52 before he was bowled by @entity1 and brother @entity37 soon followed , caught by @entity42 off the bowling of @entity44 for 51			0
that was the end of @entity9 's resistance as they lost their last five wickets for just 15 runs with @entity1 their chief tormentor			1
the first victim of his hat - trick was @entity54 , trapped lbw by a dipping yorker before @entity57 's middle stump was removed by a similar delivery , traveling at 144 km per hour			1
@entity1 secured his second @entity60 treble with another vicious yorker that clattered into @entity63 's stumps			2
just a few balls later @entity1 claimed his sixth victim as he bowled @entity66 to end @entity9 's innings on 142			2
@entity8 wasted no time recording victory as @entity69 smashed an unbeaten 67 and put on 72 with @entity70 , before he was caught by @entity31 off the bowling of @entity66			0
captain @entity72 hit a quick 27 not out off just 24 balls to seal a comprehensive victory for @entity8 , who bounced back in style after their defeat by @entity78			0
but the co-hosts will undoubtedly face a much stiffer test in their next match when they face defending champions @entity83 on saturday .			0
