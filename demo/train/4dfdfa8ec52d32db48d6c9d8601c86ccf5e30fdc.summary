-- so it comes down to this : on tuesday , the president who ca n't possibly win re-election confronts the challenger who ca n't possibly beat him			1
licensed , as i am , to pump gas and commit punditry in all 50 states and the @entity10 , i am obligated to make a prediction			1
or , in other words : it 's time to guess			0
three weeks ago , on @entity15 's " @entity14 , " i ventured that something happened at that @entity18 debate beyond president @entity19 not showing up for work			2
the president , i noted , had never run a campaign to get re-elected , just a campaign to stop the other guy , @entity24 , from getting elected			2
when the @entity24 who arrived to debate was not the sulfur - breathing demon the president had led us to expect , @entity19 was left with no campaign at all			1
" this is a man with two empty holsters , " i noted			0
" his campaign could collapse			0
" i think it did			0
@entity24 : my vision for @entity35 then an unexpected voter named @entity37 resuscitated @entity19 's campaign			1
what factors must we understand in these final hours to identify the winner of this election ? first , we 'd have to understand who is going to win independents			1
four years ago , @entity19 won independents by 8 points over @entity47			1
after the @entity18 debate , that advantage reversed itself			0
in recent @entity52 / @entity51 tracking polls , @entity19 has trailed @entity24 among independent voters by 16 to 20 percentage points			1
recent @entity56 polls also reported that @entity24 has led @entity19 among independents by 5 % in @entity58 , 6 % in @entity59 and a massive 21 % in @entity60			1
if this lead among independents held through @entity63 , @entity24 would win these states			1
post-sandy survey data , however , indicates the storm may have blown away @entity24 's advantage with independents , at least temporarily			1
the @entity70 / @entity69 has the president pulling within 1 point among independent voters , 43 % to 44 %			0
our own @entity74 of swing states has the president taking a one point lead among purple state independents , 45 % to 44 %			2
however , the final @entity15 / @entity81 national poll reports that @entity24 is winning independents by 7 points			1
and the new @entity0 / @entity85 poll gives @entity24 a 22 % lead with independents			1
who wins independents might depend upon whether @entity19 's " @entity94 " was a real change or a temporary bump in the president 's fortunes			1
if voters believe the president 's energetic response indicates he has learned a lesson and will be more responsive to them in a second term , this election could break @entity19 's way			1
@entity19 : my vision for @entity35 second , to identify the winner , we 'd have to see whether @entity24 has closed the gender gap			1
the latest @entity109 poll has @entity24 erasing a 16 - point gender gap in the past month			1
@entity111 tells us @entity24 's and @entity19 's favorability ratings among women voters are now nearly equal			1
@entity111 analyst @entity114 expects the gender gap " to look very similar to the last few election cycles , with women somewhere between 6 and 8 points to favor @entity19 , and fairly consistent with where we 've been since 1980			1
" our own @entity119 @entity74 has @entity24 closing the gender gap to 7 points , enough for him to win			1
third , to call the election for @entity19 , i 'd have to believe he does n't hit his head on the ceiling every time he stands , but he does			1
the president 's percentage number is stuck some 2 % or 3 % short of the 50 % mark			1
the @entity129 national average has @entity19 stuck at 47.8 % with @entity24 tight on his heels at 47.3 %			1
our last two @entity131 of likely voters in swing states have @entity19 at 47 % to 48 %			1
surveys that show a higher percentage for the president , cracking the 50 % line , such as the overcooked @entity139 poll in @entity58 , are preposterously overweighted with @entity140			1
@entity139 unexplainably paints @entity58 9 % more @entity141 than @entity142 , with the @entity142 share of the electorate lower today than in 2008 , when @entity142 were swallowing razor blades and @entity19 mania was cresting			1
other surveys , which perhaps have spent less time in the crock pot , show a different @entity58 : a @entity56 / @entity150 poll reports @entity142 enthusiasm outstripping @entity141 enthusiasm in @entity58 by 14 points			0
politics : if @entity19 wins ... my experience is that polarizing incumbents running against acceptable challengers can count on getting just about exactly what they are getting in the last poll , heading into the election -- and no more			1
the electoral ceiling over @entity19 's head is hard			2
in my view , it is a couple of points too low for him to win re-election			0
what else would we have to understand to identify the likely winner ? fourth , we 'd have to see who has captured the powerful remnants of the 2010 surge that renewed the " silent majority 's " voice and secured @entity142 control of the @entity178			0
anecdotal evidence and survey data tell us that @entity24 has momentum with white , working - class men in swing states and nationally			2
a new poll from the conservative @entity185 has @entity24 within a point in blue - collar @entity187			2
@entity19 's campaign is suddenly running ads in a working - class state such as @entity191 that he had previously put in his pocket			2
new data has @entity24 tied with @entity19 in @entity191 , 47 % to 47 % , within 2 points in @entity58 , and tied with the president in @entity196			1
meanwhile , @entity24 is drawing the largest crowds of his campaign , packed with those @entity200 - @entity140 men , in , of all places , @entity58			2
early on @entity63 , if @entity24 starts winning blue - collar , working class counties in western @entity191 , he will win them everywhere , including @entity58 , @entity204 , @entity196 and @entity187			1
at this point , it is almost impossible for @entity24 to win the presidency small			1
he either loses or puts around 300 electoral votes in the bank			0
fifth , to identify our next president , we would have to understand who has the edge , compared with ' 08 , in early and absentee voting			0
@entity142 sources tell me that in @entity58 , for example , @entity142 have increased their early turnout by more than 100,000 from 2008 while @entity141 turnout is down 150,000			0
that is a 250,000 - vote swing in a state @entity19 only won by 260,000 votes at the apogee of his popularity			2
this pattern , i 'm informed , holds in other swing states			0
@entity228 , we have to examine whether the @entity19 campaign can compensate for dimming passion among its supporters with a more energetic turn - out - the - vote machine on @entity63			2
it 's fair to admit that @entity234 has had a four - year head start , nearly endless resources and a brilliant team of social media wizards to build an unmatched get - out - the - vote operation			0
but @entity19 has disappointed even his own supporters			2
the thrill of his historic political accomplishment is gone			0
without passion to fuel the machine , a turnout engine is just a collection of bolts			0
politics : if @entity24 wins ... my experience is that the @entity252 were right : money ca n't buy you love , or turnout			1
@entity257 , to identify our next president , we have to understand how publicly embarrassing it is to be a @entity142 these days			0
@entity260 , the music industry , the news media , the fashion industry , the intellectual elite and the news media all fawn over @entity19			2
to identify yourself as a @entity142 @entity24 voter , however , is to admit that you are culturally backward			2
in effect , survey questioners are asking @entity19 voters if they self - identify as cool			2
they are asking @entity24 voters if they would publicly admit to wearing socks with sandals			2
too often , @entity142 dare not speak their name , because they know the cool kids wo n't invite them to play			0
this phenomenon , the reticent @entity142 factor , like the shy @entity279 factor found in @entity281 polls in the ' 90s , could easily account for a 4 % to 5 % unexpected @entity285 bump on @entity63			0
late polls in 1980 gave @entity200 only a 2 % to 3 % lead over @entity288			0
@entity200 ended up winning by nearly 10 %			0
for the same reason , i would expect this campaign 's final public opinion polls and exit polls this tuesday to underreport the @entity142 vote by a handful of points			0
add it all up , and this is a close call			0
perhaps it is best made both with my heart and my head			0
four years ago , @entity19 's campaign claimed a unique energy			0
electing the first black president of the @entity35 was a singular moment of national pride			0
now the @entity19 campaign pretends the opposite : they tell us that history - making event was ordinary			0
@entity234 and many others model their turnout predictions and surveys upon 2008 , overloading them with @entity140			0
they would have us think that the electoral cosmos has been realigned in a stable and permanent way			0
in the end , i can not embrace as common the rarest of political astronomies			0
i do not believe @entity19 's comet comes around every day			0
that leaves @entity24 as the next president of the @entity35			0
opinion : what 's really at stake in election 2012 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity330 .			1

@entity330 says it takes some guesswork to predict outcome of such a close election
he says several factors make @entity24 more likely to win
@entity24 has made progress in reducing gender gap and may have an edge with independents
@entity330 : @entity19 has n't cracked 50 % barrier , and his 2008 win looks unlikely to repeat
