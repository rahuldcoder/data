-- once labeled the richest football club in @entity2 , @entity4 champions @entity3 are now on the brink of extinction			1
the club that boasts a record 54 league titles and 60 domestic cups since being formed in 1872 has sunk to the lowest ebb of its illustrious 140 - year history			0
already in administration and with a potential tax bill of $ 118 million , the genuine prospect exists that @entity3 -- one half of the @entity17 rivalry with @entity19 neighbors @entity20 -- could be about to fold , inflicting irreversible damage on the @entity22			1
so if a football club with as proud a history as @entity3 can come so close to the precipice , how likely is it that the disease of financial mismanagement will claim other high - profile scalps across @entity29 ? football 's rising costs according to football finance expert @entity34 , many clubs on the continent are similarly stretched as they grapple with soaring wages and transfer fees -- and a failure to make the most from their assets			1
@entity34 , a professor of @entity39 at the @entity2 's @entity40 , says the next five years could be critical in shaping the long - term future of football in @entity29 , as cash - rich clubs in @entity44 , @entity45 and the @entity46 compete for the globe 's best players			1
" there are two common elements to what is happening in @entity29 , " he told @entity0			1
" the first one is revenue generation			0
a lot of clubs simply do n't have a notion of the ways in which they could alternatively generate revenue other than tickets sales			2
" the other element is cost control , and obviously that relates to player transfer fees and wage costs			0
if there was moderation in the industry generally , if salary costs and transfer fees could be moderated in some way , that would ease clubs ' financial problems			1
" increasingly you 've got clubs in @entity45 , in @entity44 and in some parts of the @entity46 that are paying huge transfer fees and huge wages			2
in many ways it 's very difficult for clubs to control their costs because many of the mechanisms are outside their control			2
" driven by debt @entity34 's assessment of the general health of @entity29 's clubs is bleak , with teams in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and even @entity96 -- the one league held up as a beacon of financial integrity -- struggling			1
even two of the biggest clubs on the continent , @entity92 duo @entity103 and @entity105 , who drive huge wealth and success , are operating on a huge debt base			1
" @entity109 and @entity105 are massive revenue - generating entities , their costs are very high , " @entity34 said			1
" the most obvious elements are transfer fees and salaries			0
as a consequence of that , if you look at the two of the biggest three club debtors in the world they are @entity103 and @entity105			0
" outside @entity103 and @entity105 there is no conception of the need to manage their organizations better , to manage their businesses better or commercialize in any way			0
in terms of revenue generation and cost control , a lot of @entity92 clubs are operating in the dark ages			0
" the @entity96 @entity133 is renowned as being a model competition , where the football fan is king			0
supporters retain a majority stake in their club , tickets prices are affordable , wealth is distributed far more equally than in other leagues and wages are kept under control			0
chasing @entity146 cash but @entity34 points to the example of @entity148 , a club that finished in the top three in @entity96 four times in the past seven years but is now grappling with the debts incurred through building a new stadium			1
the @entity153 are desperately hoping that qualification this year for @entity29 's top club competition , the @entity146 , will prove a timely boon to their bank balance			1
" @entity148 is in a very precarious financial position but many people say @entity96 football is a role model for financial propriety and good management -- it 's not			1
there are problems all over @entity29 , " @entity34 said			1
he sees @entity168 outfit @entity167 , regarded as one of the @entity94 ' big three sides alongside @entity171 and @entity172 , as a club facing a typical , modern - day predicament			0
" @entity167 are in a much more precarious position than @entity171 and @entity172 for the simple reason that they are not qualifying for @entity29 and yet they are still very ambitious , " @entity34 said			1
" the big challenge for @entity167 is to go for @entity146 football and get it really soon , otherwise their business model is not sustainable			1
then they will have to develop a business model that is consistent with being a solvent member of the @entity187 , but basically mid-table plodders			0
" a global power shift ? with @entity193 football at a crossroads , @entity29 's new @entity191 ( @entity191 ) initiative could prove a masterstroke of timing			1
the rules , which aim to force clubs to live within their means , are introduced next year			0
" @entity191 could be the moderating force in the labor market but one of the big issues is that the football labor market is no longer dominated by the @entity193 , it is now a global labor market , " @entity34 said			1
" when you 've got the likes of ( former @entity209 striker ) @entity210 on a reported $ 268,000 a week in @entity45 and @entity211 on reported $ 553,000 a week in @entity44 , this is fueling the inflationary spiral			0
" as we see in any market , resources flow to where the returns are greatest			0
i think we 're potentially on the cusp of a real shift in global power in football simply because clubs elsewhere in the world can afford to pay for the likes of @entity210 and @entity211			2
" @entity4 giants in jeopardy should @entity193 clubs need any reminder as to what despair can emerge from chasing success on the field , they need only look at @entity3			1
the @entity19 team 's slide into administration relates to an unpaid tax bill of $ 14 million , incurred after businessman @entity239 bought the club in june 2010 , but they are also being pursued by the @entity2 government , which says an astonishing $ 118 million is owed in back taxes			0
a tribunal is due to rule on the case this month , and if @entity3 lose , they could be wiped off the map forever			2
" if @entity3 were to go into liquidation it would be absolutely unbelievable , " @entity4 football expert @entity246 told @entity0			1
" i 've been writing about this story for the last 18 months and i still can not believe it			0
" the club would probably be reborn in some kind of way , but just facing the fact that for a period in history @entity3 might cease to exist does seem unbelievable			2
" a two - team league ? much of the interest aroused by the @entity22 is based on the intense rivalry between @entity3 and @entity19 neighbors @entity20 , a divide along sectarian lines that is famous around the globe			2
but officials at @entity20 , a club proud of its @entity266 and @entity267 heritage , insist they feel no sympathy with their @entity270 bedfellows , and can continue to thrive even if the blue half of @entity19 goes under			0
whether the league could is another matter , given that no club other than @entity3 or @entity20 has won the title since @entity277 's triumph in 1984			2
" the thing @entity4 football does have is this brand called the @entity17 and whether you call it car crash television or not , everybody is attracted to it , " @entity246 said			1
" @entity20 fans are stupidly dancing on the grave of @entity3 , because @entity20 need @entity3			2
@entity20 are greatly diminished if their great rivals disappear			0
if one of the @entity17 was taken out and shot at dawn it would greatly diminish the other half			0
" at one stage this season , @entity3 led the league by 12 points			2
but a run of poor form , combined with the 10 - point deduction incurred for falling into administration , means @entity20 are now 21 points clear and certainties for the title			0
ironically , the @entity303 could wrap up their 43rd league title at @entity305 in the @entity17 clash on march 25 .			0

@entity3 ' financial plight casts doubt on *stability* of clubs elsewhere in @entity29
football expert says clubs on the continent are similarly stretched financially
@entity34 says lack of business nous and rise of other regions has had impact
if @entity3 went under it could have dire *repercussions* in @entity4 , says *journalist*
