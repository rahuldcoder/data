like many parents , @entity0 was thrilled to learn that @entity3 's biggest department store recently reopened its toy department with a fresh look : dolls and trucks @entity6			1
instead of organizing toys into color - coded aisles of pink for girls and blue for boys , @entity10 ' new 26,000 square - foot " @entity11 " is broken into six interactive " worlds			1
" looking for costumes , a rocking horse or stuffed elephants ? try the @entity22 , which @entity10 describes as " a fairground of circus acts and candy floss , with magicians and jugglers on stage			1
" in the @entity39 , " a gigantic space rocket crashes through the floor and a huge sun bursts through the wall in front of an @entity35 - inspired space and gadget zone , complete with alien space pods and limited - edition pieces			2
" for @entity41 , a mother of three in suburban @entity43 , it 's a step in the right direction toward breaking down the gender divide erected at an early age through playtime			1
she experienced firsthand how those barriers can hurt children and make them feel like they need to change who they are to gain acceptance on the playground			0
two years ago , @entity41 's 7 - year - old daughter came home in tears after classmates teased her for carrying a " @entity59 " thermos to school , saying " @entity62 " was for boys			1
@entity0 shared the story on her blog , @entity67 , and within a matter of days , the tale of " @entity64 " went viral , drawing support from around the world			1
her plight did n't just strike a nerve with parents and children -- @entity76 ' daughter , also named @entity77 , and the actor who played @entity79 also had words of wisdom for @entity77 based on their experiences getting bullied for somehow being different			1
the sheer volume of responses compelled @entity41 to delve into why so many people could relate to @entity77 's story			1
that research culminated in her first book , " bullied : what @entity91 , teacher and @entity93 to know about ending the cycle of @entity96 , " released this month			1
in it , she explores the subtle and not - so - subtle ways in which society fosters a fear of those perceived as different and what parents can do about it			1
the negative effects of enforcing gender norms emerged as a prominent theme , including the way girls are often nudged in the direction of princess fantasies and dolls while building blocks and train sets are traditionally boys ' toys			1
it 's part of the reason why @entity41 saw the move by a large retailer such as @entity10 as promising			1
removing gender - specific connotations from packaging or displays sends the message to children that they 're open to everyone , she said			1
when stores separate toys into aisles for girls and boys , however , they learn that anyone who deviates from their designated shelves deserves to be ridiculed			1
" we ca n't truly address bullying without talking about the fear of people perceived as different , " @entity0 said			1
" if you have a 6 - to 8 - year - old boy who goes into @entity10 and sees ' @entity59 ' toys next to other dolls and action figures , maybe it 'll make him think differently when he sees a girl with a ' @entity59 ' thermos			1
we could be preventing future bullies by teaching them to be open - minded now			0
" in the chapter " calling on @entity156 to eliminate gender - based marketing , " @entity41 posits that the reason stores segregate by gender is so they can sell more of the same product			1
if a store carries soccer balls in pink and blue , a mother shopping for her son and daughter can buy one for each			0
in addition to reinforcing gender stereotypes , the brother and sister no longer need to share , " eliminating an opportunity to develop their social skills , " @entity0 says in the book			1
with children returning to school , @entity41 's book lands at a time when bullying is front and center in parents ' minds			2
it also comes in an era when the connection between gender norms and bullying is getting increased scrutiny from parents , educators and activists , prompting more direct action instead of just talk			1
when @entity194 announced plans to sell a new line of sets packaged in pink boxes and containing busty characters , salons and spas , girl - led activist movement @entity193 launched a petition to quash the toys			2
restricting train sets to boys and dress - up to girls not only reinforces outdated gender roles but also stifles creativity , said psychology professor @entity210 of the @entity211 of @entity212 in @entity213 and co-founder of @entity193			1
" kids get a lot of ideas early from play about what they can do , what they like and what they can aspire to , " @entity210 said			0
" by making those themes gender specific , it leaves out a whole range of possibilities			0
" efforts at gender neutral play are not about eradicating the sight of pink or blue from toy stores or necessarily pushing children away from toys traditionally associated with their gender , she said			2
it 's simply a matter of making them feel like all options are open			0
" it 's about making all these ways of playing part of the human experience			0
anxiety about gender has created codes that have nothing to do with how people should be people , " she said			0
" there 's nothing wrong with pink			0
it 's the meaning we infuse it with			0
" many independent toy stores across the @entity256 have been doing what @entity10 is doing for decades			2
@entity258 was tired of toy shopping for her children and seeing the same limited offerings of @entity262 and baby dolls in the girls ' aisle and cars and action figures designated for boys			2
so she opened a toy store in @entity43 in 1974 with " open - ended activities " in mind : puzzles , games , building blocks , train sets and dolls arranged by theme instead of color - coded aisles of pink for girls and blue for boys			1
but more than 30 years later , @entity258 is concerned by the marketing direction she said some toy manufacturers are pushing on her			0
she 's reluctant to carry makeup sets and spa kits targeted at tweens and does n't see the point of selling green @entity289 with a picture of a boy on the box			0
for that matter , why should she fill her tiny store with pink bicycles adorned with flowers instead of yellow or purple ones that might appeal to boys and girls ? " i am becoming increasingly concerned with how we seem to be veering back into very gender - specific toys and activities , " said @entity258 , who owns four toys et @entity302 locations in the @entity43 area			1
" it 's almost as if we 've backtracked			0
we 're pushing little girls into princess dresses and ballerina costumes			0
" that 's not to say her stores do n't carry fairy dresses or knights			0
but she tries to balance it out with costumes of doctors , chefs and pirates that show boys and girls on the packaging			2
she would n't even mind selling green in - line skates as long as the packaging is n't directed at one gender over the other			2
" there are a lot of good , responsible manufacturers out there that go out of their way to depict objects in play showing both girls and boys , " she said			2
" i generally opt for the ones that are basically presenting the activity appropriate for both sexes			0
" @entity0 's book also looks at how reducing a woman 's value to her physical attractiveness plays into bullying , especially among girls			1
with makeup kits being marketed to children at younger ages , beauty and body adornment become ways in which children choose bullying targets			0
" toys for girls are overwhelmingly spa kits and princess parties , all these things to beautify themselves with , " @entity0 said			1
" there 's nothing wrong with wanting to look pretty , but if your reason to look pretty is to please the kids at school , that 's where it 's a problem			0
" it 's not just an issue for parents of young girls			2
@entity372 and her son are used to dealing with odd looks and comments from strangers over his affinity for all things pink , including dresses , jewelry and toys			0
when 7 - year - old @entity383 's preference for " pretty things " emerged at an early age , @entity372 struggled with how to handle it			0
the bumpy road to acceptance prompted her to share her family 's story in the picture book , " my princess boy , " which came out in 2010 , stirring a bit of controversy			0
@entity372 said she supports him , even though she still has occasional moments of hesitation when he emerges from his room in a red dress			0
" as parents , we all want our kids to be happy and to be themselves , " she said			2
" but things get in the way of expression and letting kids choose toys or clothes that express who they are			2
" in public though , adults seem to have the hardest time accepting it			0
just last week , a little girl in the toy aisle told @entity383 that he could n't have the mermaid toy he wanted because " it 's not for boys , " @entity372 said			0
when the girl looked to her mother for guidance , she agreed			0
" i think there 's a lot more anxiety around it on the parent 's side , but we set the example for our kids , " @entity372 said			0
boys are more likely to get picked on for stepping outside of the box to play with dolls or wear a pink backpack than girls are for playing with cars or wearing jeans , said @entity210 , the psychology professor			1
it only makes matters worse when parents attach negative connotations to boys acting on traditionally feminine tendencies out of fear that they 'll be labeled " gay , " she said			2
" if kids are coming into social situations with more constrained ideas about what boys and girls should be from playing , you can see how that would contribute to the negative reinforcement of ideas about identity and sexuality , " @entity210 said			1
well - intentioned parents might feel like they 're saving their sons from bullying by pointing them away from traditionally feminine toys or behaviors			1
but @entity0 said that encouraging them to change for the sake of others protects the bully and not the child			2
" in the short term , they might protect the child from being taunted , but in the long term , it shows the world that who he really is is n't as important as the status quo , " she said			0
" those are the kids who are really tormented because they 're not allowed to express themselves			0
