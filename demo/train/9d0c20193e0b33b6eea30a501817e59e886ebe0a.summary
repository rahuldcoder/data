the vice chairman of the @entity1 told @entity2 on monday he has seen numerous undisclosed e-mails between @entity1 staffers and the @entity5 that raise new questions about potential improper contact between two federal agencies in the alleged targeting of conservative political groups			1
@entity11 , a @entity12 @entity1 commissioner , said an investigator from his agency contacted @entity15 , the @entity5 employee at the center of the political storm now engulfing that agency			1
he said the contact was made to discuss the status of one such conservative political advocacy group , the @entity20			2
shortly after @entity15 was contacted , the @entity5 sent a questionnaire to the @entity20 , @entity11 added			1
" who 's the dog and who 's the tail ( in this case ) ? who knows , " @entity11 said			2
but " dealing with @entity15 is probably out of the ordinary			0
" the answers , @entity11 stressed , " could be benign ( or ) could be more sinister			0
" @entity29 , @entity5 escalate fight over investigation @entity11 , who did not provide a timeline of events , said @entity1 commissioners had not given their staffers permission to reach out to the @entity5 on the matter , which is generally required for such inquiries			1
the e-mails @entity11 described to @entity2 are exactly what @entity12 congressional investigators are asking @entity5 and @entity1 officials to turn over to @entity42 as part of its investigation			1
@entity46 , the @entity47 chairwoman of the @entity1 , said she does not know about the e-mails between the @entity1 investigator and @entity15 to which @entity11 is referring			1
" if there was any evidence or targeting based on ideology , that would be extremely serious , but i have not seen any evidence of that , " she said			0
" i am not aware of requesting or receiving any confidential taxpayer information			0
i am not aware of any requests for anything that was n't publicly available			0
" last week , congressional @entity58 disclosed several e-mails between @entity15 , the former head of the @entity5 division handling tax exempt organizations , and an unnamed @entity1 attorney inquiring about the status of the @entity20 and another conservative outfit , the @entity65			1
the e-mails were first uncovered by @entity68 chairman @entity67 , @entity69 , who sent a letter last week to acting @entity5 commissioner @entity71 requesting additional details regarding exchanges between @entity15 and the @entity1			1
@entity74 to nominate restructuring specialist to head @entity5 the e-mails that congressional @entity58 released only reference and request publicly available information on the two groups			1
@entity11 told @entity2 , however , that the additional e-mails he has seen do not clearly state whether the @entity1 was only seeking public data			1
asking for private data would most likely be a violation of federal law			0
@entity11 was not able to specify whether contact was initiated by @entity15 or the @entity1 , which regulates political speech and handles numerous complaints every election cycle about alleged violations of its campaign rules and regulations			1
contacted by @entity2 on monday , the @entity5 emphasized that the agency " takes its obligation to protect confidential taxpayer information very seriously			2
" an @entity5 spokeswoman noted that the agency is prohibited from discussing information contained in specific tax returns			0
republicans -- led by @entity101 chairman @entity29 -- insist that after president @entity74 's 2008 election , the @entity5 started intentionally targeting conservative outfits seeking tax - exempt status			1
the prospect of potential @entity1 involvement raises the prospect of a broader federal targeting effort			2
@entity47 argue there is nothing sinister and that the contact is nothing more than requests for information that is already in the public domain			0
still , @entity58 question why @entity1 staffers would bother contacting @entity15 -- herself a former @entity1 employee -- for information already publicly available			1
@entity15 made headlines after she invoked her @entity121 right against self - incrimination when called before the @entity101 in may to testify on the controversy			0
" things seemed weird to me " after examining the undisclosed e-mails , @entity11 told @entity2			2
" the @entity1 has not had a good track record with calling balls and strikes			0
they 've been criticized for not playing fair			0
" if nothing else , he added , this " creates the appearance that people are being selectively targeted			0
and that 's something that should never happen			0
" @entity20 founder @entity136 argued in a written statement last week that the publicly released correspondence between the @entity5 and the @entity1 " indicates questionable behavior			2
" " we will cooperate with ( the ) ongoing investigations to root out the bad actors in the politically driven , out - of - control bureaucracy the @entity5 and the government has become			0
" for their part , @entity47 have dismissed the latest revelations and insist groups on both the left and the right were improperly scrutinized as part of a clumsy administration of vague election - related tax laws			2
" @entity68 @entity58 are doing everything they can to distract attention from their inability to focus on jobs and the economy , " said @entity154 , a spokesman for @entity47 on the @entity68 , which is also investigating the alleged targeting			1
" republicans are throwing mud against the wall with the hope that some will stick			0
" to date , @entity12 - led @entity5 investigations of tea party targeting have uncovered no evidence any of it was directed by @entity74 political officials			1
@entity5 interviews show no political bias , democrats say			0

@entity47 chief of @entity1 says she does n't know about the e-mails
@entity12 discusses additional e-mails between @entity5 and @entity1
@entity11 : @entity1 staffer improperly contacted @entity15 of @entity5 about conservative group
@entity58 ask if @entity1 revelations indicate a broader targeting of conservatives
