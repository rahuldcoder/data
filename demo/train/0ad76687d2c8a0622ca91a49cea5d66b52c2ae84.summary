-- it started with a haircut			0
the year was 1960 , and @entity3 sat in his chair at the local barber 's shop			2
@entity7 , one of the most iconic football coaches of his day , had just led @entity10 club @entity9 to the @entity11 and achieved legendary status			2
but that was not enough for him -- he wanted more			0
while pondering his plans , a gentleman in the next chair , who happened to be visiting the country as coach of touring @entity22 side @entity20 , let @entity3 in on a little secret			0
he told the @entity24 about " a @entity25 " -- the man they were calling " the @entity28			0
" a legend had begun to spread from @entity30 about a young player plying his trade with a youth team in the @entity36 country 's capital , now known as @entity37 , with links to @entity9 's great rivals -- @entity40			0
the son of a white @entity44 railway worker and a black mother from the @entity30 community , @entity41 was the name on everybody 's lips			1
@entity3 took no chances -- @entity41 's mother had already turned down the advances of @entity54 club @entity53 , so he made the family an offer they could not refuse			1
the financial incentive worked and the player joined @entity9 , much to the dismay of @entity40 officials , who had dallied in their pursuit of the player			0
the rest , as they say , is history -- and what a history : 733 goals in 745 matches confirmed @entity41 's status as one of the all - time greats			1
as @entity74 said goodbye to one of its most famous sons monday , following his death at the age of 71 , thousands took to the streets to farewell a man who had brought joy and inspiration to a generation as the government declared three days of mourning			1
" as a man , he was quite humble , kind and very down to earth , " said @entity0 's @entity87 , a @entity9 supporter who was in @entity88 for the funeral			0
" he had a tremendous amount of love for his club @entity9 , for whom he served as an ambassador			0
" i 've seen fans from various clubs , including longtime rivals , paying homage to a man they 've learned to respect for his talent and flair , but also for his personality			0
" only a man such as @entity41 would be able to unify fans in such fashion			1
" during an illustrious career in which he won 11 @entity10 league titles , five domestic cups and a @entity115 crown , @entity41 became a legend of world football			1
from the moment he entered national consciousness by helping @entity9 retain the @entity11 in 1962 , where he scored twice in a thrilling 5 - 3 final win over @entity124 in @entity125 , the country began to fall in love with the man from @entity30			0
his incredible acceleration and lethal right foot helped him take @entity9 to the very top of the @entity115 game , while he was honored as the continent 's best player by winning the @entity134 in 1965			1
but it was at the 1966 @entity136 that he became worldwide sensation as he produced a series of performances which brought adulation from from across the globe			1
his nine goals , the most by any player at the tournament , helped @entity74 reach the semifinal where it was beaten by the host nation @entity147 , which eventually went on to win the tournament			1
such was @entity41 's impact that @entity150 reportedly offered the striker 40 times his salary to lure him away from @entity9 and even approached his wife to sign the contract on his behalf			1
the move was scuppered , however , in rather bizarre circumstances though , as @entity10 prime minister @entity158 refused @entity41 permission to leave the country			1
instead , @entity41 remained at @entity9 , scoring goals and helping his side reach the 1968 @entity11 final , but this time losing to @entity164 at @entity165 after extra-time			1
it was in that contest that @entity41 's sportsmanlike qualities shone through			1
with the game tied , @entity41 had the opportunity to win the contest but when his effort was brilliantly saved by @entity164 keeper @entity174 , the striker simply stood and applauded			1
it was a gesture which would not be forgotten			0
that same year , he won the @entity115 golden boot as the continent 's top goalscorer -- a feat he repeated five years later			2
after leaving @entity9 in 1975 , @entity41 moved across the @entity180 to play in the @entity181 before retiring in 1980 following ongoing problems with his right knee			2
he continued to work in football as an ambassador for @entity9 and @entity74 's national side , meeting with high - profile players on @entity115 match nights and attending global tournaments on a regular basis until his death on january 5 , 2014			1
he left behind his wife @entity192 and their two daughters			0
" i think he is immortal , " @entity196 's @entity10 coach @entity195 told state broadcaster @entity197			0
" we all know what he meant for football and especially for @entity10 football			0
" he was not only a great inspiration but also an important figure in upholding the values , principles and feelings of football , even after finishing his career			0
" @entity41 's status as @entity74 's greatest football player was confirmed by the thousands who flocked to watch his coffin paraded through the streets of @entity88			1
his statue , which stands proud outside @entity9 's @entity217 , is adorned with scarves , flowers and banners from fans across the globe			0
" i was the best player in the world , top scorer in the world , " @entity41 once said			1
" i did everything , except win a @entity136			2
" that he did not win one does not detract from the impact he made on @entity74 and on football around the world			2
within moments of the news breaking that he had passed away following a heart attack , the likes of @entity231 and @entity232 were paying tribute to " @entity237 " -- the @entity238			1
in @entity88 , despite the rain , fans continued to line the streets to say farewell as the black hearse moved slowly through the streets			0
" even though my generation did n't see him play , through archive we were able to witness some of his brilliant skill , " added @entity87 , who grew up listening to tales of @entity41			2
" but even better than that , we were able learn about what he meant as a footballer and person through the stories of our parents and grandparents			0
" the way that he exploded on the pitch , with his fast pace combined with the power of his right foot , was simply unreal			0
his attributes could easily make him a star even in today 's game			2
" though he may now have passed away , @entity41 's legacy remains			1
a trailblazer who overcame poverty and early hardship in @entity36 to become one of the game 's most talented and recognizable faces			0
it would appear that in barber shops in @entity88 , they 'll be talking about @entity41 for many years to come .			2
