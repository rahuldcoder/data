-- world no. 3 @entity1 remains on course to win a second consecutive grand slam singles title after overcoming a challenge from @entity7 to reach the semifinals of the @entity9			1
the @entity11 champion battled past 12th seed @entity7 of @entity14 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) in wednesday 's quarterfinal to reach the last four in @entity15 for the sixth time in her career			1
the @entity18 third seed will face world no. 2 @entity19 on thursday for a place in the final -- a repeat of september 's title clash at @entity25			1
@entity19 , runner - up at the last two grand slams after also losing to @entity26 in the @entity28 final , took just over an hour to dispatch of @entity33 25th seed @entity31 6 - 2 6 - 4			1
top 10 moments of the @entity9 first week the @entity36 second seed was full of praise for her 20 - year - old @entity33 opponent , who knocked out home favorite and world number five @entity41 on her way to her second grand slam quarterfinal , matching her feat at @entity28 in 2010			1
" at 6 - 2 3 - 0 i was trying to keep playing the same way i was playing , but she really lifted her game , " the 26 - year - old @entity19 told reporters			1
" she 's a very good player			2
she took that opportunity , that little chance i gave her , and used it to get back into the match			0
i 'm happy with the way i handled the situation during those moments , though			0
" @entity1 , meanwhile , faced arguably her toughest test so far in world @entity60 , who was playing in her first tournament for three months following a foot injury			2
but despite losing a 4 - 1 lead in the first set and going down a break of serve early in the second , the more experienced @entity1 closed out the match to make the semifinals in @entity68 for the first time since her brief period of retirement from the game in 2008			2
" i felt a little bit tired and heavy out there today , but i fought well and stayed really focused , and tried not to lose too much energy on getting frustrated , " the mother - of - one told the official @entity75 website			0
the 27 - year - old admitted that she would have to improve in order to add the @entity9 title to the three grand slam singles crowns she has already won in @entity83 in 2005 , 2009 and 2010			2
" everything has to be better			0
the serving , the returning , the unforced errors -- everything			0
but i 'm in the semifinals and i do n't feel i 've played my best tennis , so that 's a good thing , " she said			0
" i 'm hanging in there			0
sometimes it 's more of an achievement than winning your matches very easily			0
" in thursday 's other semifinal , world number one @entity97 will play @entity102 ninth seed @entity100 after the pair both won their quarterfinal matches on tuesday			1
@entity106 's @entity97 is attempting to claim her first major title , while @entity100 -- who also reached the last four in @entity15 last year -- hopes to become the first woman from her country to reach a grand slam final .			1
