-- when @entity4 , an @entity6 - @entity3 stand - up comic , started doing comedy tours of the @entity8 his friends in the @entity3 assumed he was performing at military bases			1
" they were surprised to learn that i was performing for @entity10 , that they understood @entity11 and that people actually laughed , " said @entity4			1
his frustration at the response from his fellow @entity3 prompted @entity4 to make a documentary film called " @entity16 " about comedy in the @entity8			1
@entity4 , 40 , said he wanted to challenge the @entity3 misconception that @entity10 have no sense of humor			1
the film follows @entity4 and fellow comedians on a tour taking in @entity6 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
it charts the rapidly growing popularity of stand - up comedy in the @entity8			1
" there 's always been comedy in the @entity8 , but in the form of story - telling or one - man shows , not stand - up in the contemporary @entity3 sense , " said @entity4			1
" stand - up comedy is relatively new but evolving quickly and is now happening in most @entity8 countries			1
" @entity4 , who was born in @entity6 but moved to @entity38 as a baby , began doing comedy shows in the @entity8 in 2005 , but started with small , private functions			1
although he had regularly visited @entity6 as a child , the 2005 tour was the first time in 20 years he had returned to his country of birth			2
it was while taking part in the " @entity49 " in 2007 that he first saw large audiences			0
the shows filmed for " @entity16 " had audiences totaling 20,000 people , he said			2
the theme of the film is that @entity10 sense of humor is just like that of @entity3 , although there were some differences in the expectations of audiences			1
@entity4 said : " my material in the @entity8 is pretty similar to that in the @entity3 except for deleting religious or sexually explicit content			1
the exception is @entity24 where pretty much anything goes			0
" we used to be told not to touch @entity10 politics either , but that 's changed since the @entity69 and people are now keen to hear about politics			0
" " @entity16 " was filmed last year before the start of the @entity69 , but @entity4 said the seeds for political change were visible			2
" the film was at the cutting edge before the revolution and was pre-emptive of it , " he said			0
" a lot of people who attended our shows were the same people who were marching in the streets			0
" @entity4 also observed differences between audiences in each of the countries he visited			0
" every @entity8 country i 've visited had a big sense of humor			2
it was refreshing and enlightening , " he said			0
" we had the biggest laughs in @entity25 because they have the least amount of entertainment			0
because they are so entertainment deprived , they are very ready to laugh at anything			0
" @entity4 added : " i love performing in @entity6 because it feels like a homecoming			2
" @entity24 is another favorite because it 's so open and free			0
you can say whatever you like			0
" @entity0 reported in 2010 that stand - up comedy was doing serious business in the @entity8 and that home - grown talent had taken off alongside tours by @entity110 comics			1
@entity111 , a television producer who moved from @entity112 to @entity113 and helped launch the @entity49 did a @entity115 talk in july 2010 in which he spoke of the " rise and rise of stand - up comedy in the @entity8			1
