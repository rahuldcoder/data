some of @entity28 's most popular tv shows , including " @entity29 , " " @entity30 , " " @entity31 , " " @entity32 " and " @entity33 , " started out as formats sold to networks after they proved successful in other countries			1
in addition to the structure of the show , the format seller provides the know - how , helping buyers adapt the program to the unique characteristics of viewers in each country			1
it 's a business that 's been growing since 1951 when " what 's my line ? " on @entity48 was sold to the @entity49			1
and it 's gotten bigger every year			2
" i think in these times when there is pressure on budgets , people rely on alternative formats because they know they 're getting well thought - out programs that have proven their worth in a number of territories , " said @entity53 , president of worldwide entertainment for @entity56 - based @entity55 , a world leader in format sales			1
@entity55 has a huge catalog of tv formats for sale , but at @entity14 it will shine a spotlight on " recipe to @entity76 , " a @entity75 production			1
in that show , home cooks prepare their favorite recipes in a designated category , such as appetizers one week or entrees the next			2
the day after each show , the winning food item is featured in supermarkets across the country			0
shoppers buy and taste the items and then vote for the best one overall			0
" it 's not just a traditional cooking show , " @entity53 said			2
" in @entity75 , of the top 10 products over the last 10 years , four have come as a result of this show			1
" another show on @entity55 's menu is " the @entity97 , " developed by @entity98 in @entity99			2
here , contestants stand above a pool of icy water			0
an enormous boxing glove swings slowly toward them			0
a tv monitor in the glove shows a question			1
a correct answer brings the glove to a stop			0
in " @entity112 , " contestants are put in a completely dark room and play games , including trying to identify items by touch			0
the @entity118 cable network already bought the show for the @entity28 and will premiere its @entity28 version on april 25 with @entity121 as host			0
the event also gives @entity28 - based shows a shot at the international market			2
in a press release , cable network @entity127 touted " 450 hours of new programming for international broadcasters			0
" " @entity127 comes to @entity134 with a newly expanded sales staff and a dynamic programming catalog that features some of the highest - ( rated ) series and formats on @entity28 pay tv , " @entity131 , managing director for @entity127 international content distribution , said in the release			1
" our lineup is headlined by the epic mega-doc , ' mankind : the @entity144 , ' and our hit formats will feature high on the agenda as we aggressively ramp up this area of our business and roll out some of our latest productions			1
" game and reality shows have had the greatest success at @entity14 , but nothing is guaranteed			1
the @entity155 's dating show , " @entity159 , " and the @entity157 quiz show " @entity158 " failed to win big ratings in the @entity28 despite becoming hits elsewhere			2
comedy and drama formats also are for sale			1
over the years , some of @entity28 's most beloved scripted shows were conceived elsewhere , then adapted for @entity28 viewers			1
" @entity173 " became " @entity170 , " " @entity171 " transformed into " @entity168 " and " @entity172 " turned into " @entity169			0
" more recently , " @entity177 " was successfully adapted from the @entity175 original and gave @entity157 a hit			0
other recent attempts have n't worked out as well			0
examples of flops include " prime suspect , " " @entity182 , " " @entity183 , " " @entity184 , " " @entity186 , " " @entity185 , " " @entity187 " and " @entity188 " ( which became " @entity189 " )			0
" comedy is very much of its time and often is dependent on the character and the performer , " @entity53 said			0
" it 's about the zeitgeist			2
i think comedies will work in the short term , but they 're not going to be like ' @entity199			0
' " @entity53 predicted that interactive shows , such as " recipe to @entity76 , " where viewers can watch a show and then eat the food the next day , will start a trend among tv format producers			1
" viewers love being involved , and this is just going one step further , " she said			0
of course , such shows must be taped long before they are aired			0
" it takes seven months for the supermarket to get the product in stores , " she said .			0
