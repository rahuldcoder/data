@entity0 -- following the breakdown of direct talks with @entity5 , @entity2 have begun seeking international recognition of an independent state from @entity9 nations			1
officials from the @entity11 told @entity1 thursday that the governments of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 had formally been asked to recognize a @entity11 state based on borders that existed prior to the 1967 war between @entity5 and it @entity21 neighbors			1
senior @entity11 negotiator @entity23 told @entity1 that the requests were part of an ongoing strategy to achieve statehood outside the framework of talks with @entity5			1
" these were the last ones , but i have been asking all @entity9 countries to do the same , " @entity23 said			2
he said that while most countries in @entity33 and @entity34 had already recognized @entity35 as an independent state many countries , including the @entity38 and a number of @entity9 nations , did not			2
" we still have pockets which have not done so -- we are pursuing each of them " @entity23 said			0
earlier this week the @entity43 ruled out recognizing an independent @entity11 state for now , fearing a unilateral declaration might adversely impact efforts to get the @entity48 peace process back on track			1
" the @entity43 commends the work of the @entity11 in building the institutions of the future @entity2 and reiterates its full support for their endeavours " read a statement released monday in @entity51 by the 27 @entity43 foreign ministers			2
" ... the @entity58 reiterates its readiness , when appropriate , to recognize a @entity11 state			1
" the statement was released the day after the top @entity11 negotiator , @entity61 , sent a letter to @entity43 foreign policy chief @entity63 , urging the body to back @entity11 attempts to gain international recognition of a sovereign state			1
@entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 have all moved to recognize an independent @entity11 state in recent weeks , and @entity11 officials are hoping to convince more countries to follow suit			1
both the @entity73 and the @entity38 governments have opposed such moves insisting that the only way forward is though continued negotiations			0
" there is no substitute for negotiations with @entity5 , " @entity5 government spokesman @entity78 told @entity1			0
" the fundamental cause of the of breakdown in talks was because of the consistent refusal of @entity2 to engage with @entity5			0
" @entity38 sponsored talks between the two sides fell apart in september when @entity5 resumed settlement construction the in the occupied @entity90 after a ten - month freeze			2
@entity61 told @entity1 that is the reason @entity2 would not return to the negotiating table			0
" the @entity5 government had the choice between settlements and peace and they chose settlements			0
and they alone are responsible for the derailment of the peace process , " he said			0
earlier this month the @entity102 administration announced it would be abandoning efforts to persuade @entity5 to renew the settlement freeze as a precondition for jump - starting @entity5 - @entity11 peace talks			1
instead the @entity38 is now focusing its efforts on separate talks with each side in hopes of developing a framework agreement on core issues of the conflict that could lead to the resumption of peace talks .			0
