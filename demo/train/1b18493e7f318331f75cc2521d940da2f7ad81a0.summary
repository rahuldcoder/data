it might be time to slide over that @entity3 app on the homescreen of your smartphone -- to make room for another @entity3 app. @entity9 , a news - consumption app akin to existing options like @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , will be released for the @entity15 in the @entity16 on february 3 , with other versions presumably to follow			1
the idea is to present longer - form @entity3 content in a more attractive , magazine - style way that will encourage users to linger over posts , stories and images			1
" paper makes storytelling more beautiful with an immersive design and fullscreen , distraction - free layouts , " the company said in a post on the site			0
" we 've also made it easier to craft and share beautiful stories of your own			0
" the first section of the new app will be your @entity38			1
it wo n't have all the functions of the native @entity3 app , but it will present your friends ' posts , along with stories from other news categories , in a slicker , prettier package			1
according to @entity3 , the @entity38 section will feature a new design for photos and video and the ability to read longer written posts			1
users can then customize the app by adding more than a dozen other topics , " from photography and sports to food , science and design			0
" @entity3 promises " a rich mix of content from emerging voices and well - known publications			1
" there will be no buttons to push			0
instead , users will be able to flip through stories and other posts by tilting the phone in various ways and swiping with their fingers			0
when posting your own stories , @entity9 will let you look at a preview before sharing			2
paper will be the first release from @entity78 , which is devoted exclusively to developing new mobile apps for the site			0
in the early days of its 2012 public stock offering , @entity3 was knocked by some for not having fully realized how to make money off of the rapidly growing mobile market			2
but that appears to have turned around in a big way , and @entity9 could give the company another mobile platform on which to advertise			2
on wednesday , @entity3 reported that 945 million of its 1.2 billion users visited the site via a smartphone or tablet in the last few months and that mobile represented 53 % of the site 's advertising revenue -- up from 23 % last year and zero in 2011 .			0
