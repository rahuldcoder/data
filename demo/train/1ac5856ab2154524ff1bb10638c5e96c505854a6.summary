the operator of the crippled @entity2 nuclear plant has said they need help from outside @entity4 to stabilize and safely decommission damaged reactors at the facility			1
this follows the news that regulators are poised to declare a fresh toxic water leak at @entity2 a level 3 " serious incident , " the gravest warning since the massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that sent three reactors into meltdown			1
@entity18 , vice president of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , told reporters at a press conference late wednesday that there are " many other countries outside of @entity4 that have experienced decommissioning reactors , so we hope we can consult them more and utilize their experience			2
" in that sense , we need support , not only from the @entity4 government but from the international community to do this job			0
" earlier wednesday , @entity4 's @entity34 ( @entity35 ) said the new leak was expected to be classified as a level 3 incident on the @entity38 , though this will be done once they have received an opinion from the @entity43 - based @entity42 ( @entity42 )			1
the @entity35 said they have received a first response from the @entity42 asking for more details about the leaking tank , especially the structure and its initial role			2
" the current situation is at the point where more surveillance wo n't be enough to keep the accidents from happening , " @entity49 , chairman of the @entity35 , said at a news conference wednesday			0
" our job is now to lower the risk of these accidents from becoming fatal			0
" the leak previously had a level 1 " anomaly rating " on the scale , which ranges from zero , for no safety threat , to seven , for a major accident like the meltdowns at the plant after the earthquake and tsunami			1
@entity19 , which is in charge of the plant , has struggled to manage the vast quantities of contaminated water at the plant since the tsunami , which swamped the facility			1
water pumped out of the stricken reactor buildings is being stored in large water towers at the site			0
@entity2 leaks : @entity4 ponders freezing ground in response to the latest leakage of 300 tons of toxic water , a @entity19 spokesman said wednesday the company has finished removing radioactive water from a leaky tank and transferred it to another tank at the plant			1
the leaky container is designed to hold as much as 1,000 tons of water , @entity19 said			2
the @entity42 said it was aware of reports that the @entity34 plans to rate the leak as a level 3 incident			1
" the @entity42 views this matter seriously and remains ready to provide assistance on request , " the agency said			1
scientists have pointed to high radiation levels in the waters off the plant for more than a year as evidence of problems with the company 's efforts to contain the water			2
in july , @entity19 admitted that radioactive groundwater was leaking into the @entity110 from the plant , even though an underground barrier was built to seal in the water , underscoring a growing sense of crisis at the site			1
@entity2 tuna study finds miniscule health risks the authority said in a statement on its website that the plant " remains in an unstable condition , with various risks to be addressed , and in particular managing the issue of contaminated water as a high priority			2
" @entity128 , a nuclear engineer and former @entity131 power plant operator , said the level 3 classification was warranted for the type of situation faced by @entity19 , but he said the risk to the public outside the plant was very low			1
" this is extremely radioactive water , and it would pose a very significant risk to the workers who are going to be in a position to clean it up , " he told @entity138			0
" it 's a very difficult situation because we do n't know exactly know where the leak is coming from			0
" but @entity19 spokeswoman @entity147 disputed @entity128 's assessment of the risk posed by the contaminated water			2
she said workers removing the water from the tank have sufficient protective clothing to prevent exposure			0
amid growing concerns this month about contaminated groundwater leaching into the ocean from the plant , prime minister @entity155 ordered his government to find " multiple , speedy and sure " ways to stop the water 's spread			0
" we have to deal with this at a national level , " he said			0
but experts say that any potential solutions are likely to be difficult , technologically and politically			0
