-- with over 20 years as an actor , @entity1 has a gained a serious on - screen persona			1
but when the camera is off , the 39 - year - old @entity4 is more joker than brooding artist			1
@entity8 , his co-star in the 2009 blockbuster " @entity10 : the @entity11 " -- @entity1 's first foray into @entity13 -- described @entity1 as not only incredibly talented and handsome , but also incredibly funny and silly			1
it 's perhaps an unexpected accolade for the star of films like " @entity17 " and " @entity18			2
" yet he admits that while he takes his work seriously , in " real life " he likes nothing more than having fun and relaxing with a bottle of wine			0
for a bit of respite from the fame and adulation he faces daily in @entity4 , and for a bit of fun , @entity1 once became a taxi driver for a few days			2
" no one recognized me			0
it was a weird experience , " he told @entity0			0
after returning the taxi back to a friend and playing with being anonymous , @entity1 was back into his real life , starring in hugely popular @entity4 tv series and making a name for himself in @entity13			1
" even a few years ago no one thought it would happen			0
it was just a dream for @entity4 actors , " he said			2
with " @entity10 " sequels to come , he could soon be hiding from an even bigger army of fans .			0
