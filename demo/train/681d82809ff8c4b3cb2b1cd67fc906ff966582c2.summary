-- when @entity2 showed up in front of @entity5 scouting personnel in @entity6 last month , no one was sure what to expect			1
after all , how could a man with one arm catch a football ? " i did n't drop a single pass , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" did n't bobble a pass either			1
" indeed , in his rundown for a @entity16 - @entity6 - area sports website , writer @entity13 said he was struck by the " passion , heart and determination " that @entity2 exhibited at the regional combine , where lower - tier players not invited to the national scouting combine pay to be evaluated by the @entity5			1
" he was consistent with his speed , ran around the cones low with the ball high across his chest , along his collarbone and caught all his passes			0
yes , caught all his passes , " @entity13 wrote			0
@entity2 , 25 , was born with a birth defect that stopped the growth of his left arm from the elbow down			1
for his much of his life , the southside @entity16 native has dealt with stares from strangers , awkward questions about " what happened " and of course , the bullies			0
but from a young age , there 's one thing @entity2 wanted to become : a professional football player			1
" when he was born the doctor told me not to treat him any different and that i would be surprised by what he would be able to achieve , " his mother , @entity46 , said in a phone interview from her home in @entity49 , @entity50			2
he 's been defying odds ever since			2
' like a little pro ' at age 4 , @entity2 started playing the drums			1
months later , he would learn to play the piano			0
by the time he was 6 , @entity2 decided he knew what he wanted to be when he grew up			1
" i signed him up with the little league football in our area , " his mother said			0
" and once i did , he was like a little pro already			0
he 's always been really fast			2
" @entity2 put that speed on display at @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity50 , where he started at fullback			1
" it was more than football			0
it was about discipline , " @entity2 said			1
" ever since i can remember it was just me , my mom and my ( older ) brother			0
my dad was shot and killed when i was just a few months old , so my coaches were like my father figures			0
i learned about life from them			0
" in 2007 , during his senior year , @entity2 ran for more than 800 yards			1
when he was n't scoring touchdowns , he played defense as a middle linebacker			2
" i got a couple of looks from some @entity88 and ii schools , but i decided that the best thing for me was to pursue playing football at a junior college , " he said			0
@entity2 took a year off from football before taking the field for @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity96 , in 2009			1
he played two seasons there before transferring to @entity99 , a community college in @entity100 , @entity101 , where he racked up 1,200 yards and eight touchdowns in two seasons			0
" i 've done so many things to make my success work			0
if that meant i had to transfer , then i did that , " he said			0
dream deferred in 2013 , he moved back @entity109 , hoping to play for @entity110 or @entity111 , neither of which panned out			0
but rather than let his dream die , he went home and began training to be a professional			0
" i probably would have never played football if i let what people think stop me			0
my dream was to be drafted in the @entity5			2
my cousin @entity121 ... plays for the ( @entity123 ) @entity122			0
he encouraged me to go to the combine and show the scouts what i was about			2
" in the runup to this month 's @entity5 draft , as the world watched a cavalcade of storylines -- ranging from defensive phenom @entity131 to the first openly gay player ever drafted , @entity133 -- @entity2 's uplifting story went largely unnoticed outside of a short film produced by the website worldstarhiphop.com			1
but that was n't enough for the pro scouts			2
the @entity5 draft came and went , and @entity2 went undrafted			1
that 's where @entity2 thought his dream had ended			1
" i kinda did expect that i would at least get a shot at being drafted because i felt like i gave it my all			0
i did better at the drills than people with two hands ! why not get a player who can motivate his team and play 100 % ? " a few days later , his agent called with a new opportunity			2
this weekend , @entity2 will travel to an open tryout in @entity153 , @entity154 , a @entity155 suburb , to compete for one of the 46 roster spots on the @entity158 of the @entity159			1
@entity161 's sense of humor if he 's selected , he 'll be the first player in @entity159 history to play with only one arm			1
but if he makes it , he wo n't be alone in his journey			2
@entity167 , the running backs coach for the @entity158 , was born without hands			1
" @entity161 has a funny sense of humor			0
... there 's only so many one - handed fullbacks and no - hands running backs coaches in pro football , " @entity167 said , laughing during a phone interview from @entity172			1
while some may think that this was all a devised plan by the club , neither @entity2 nor @entity167 knew about the other until @entity0 spoke to the pair			2
" it 's just a coincidence , a very big coincidence , " @entity183 , the @entity158 ' spokesman , said			1
" that 's a game - changer right there , " @entity2 told @entity0 after learning about the man who could be his position coach			1
" i 'm anxious to get down there and just learn from him -- not even football but everything in life			0
someone who is just like me			0
" @entity2 's road ahead will not be easy			1
under @entity159 rules , a certain portion of a team 's players must be @entity201			1
@entity2 knows competition will be tough			2
" i 'm trying to get a spot for how i play , not how i look , " he told @entity0			2
" the fact of the matter is that what really inspires people is how i 'm doing it			0
i love to inspire people and uplift people			0
who would n't want a better world ? ' oh @entity2 can go do that ? well i can go do this ! ' that 's what i want people to take away from my story			1
