-- more than 1,000 people have died in @entity4 since the conflict there started in mid-march , @entity2 @entity1 ban ki - moon said friday , a grim milestone that reflects his alarm over the " escalation of violence " in the authoritarian @entity12 country			1
the unrest , which started percolating in the southern city of @entity15 and then spread to the rest of the country , claimed more lives friday in @entity18 , the city known for a 1982 government massacre against the civilian population			0
at least 34 were killed friday and many more were wounded , according to @entity21 , head of the @entity23 - based @entity22 , an entity in regular touch with activists in the country			1
he said all of the deaths came from indiscriminate gunfire toward demonstrators , reviving memories of the decades - old crackdown			0
one witness , a dentist , told @entity0 he was taking part in the demonstrations when marchers were " surprised " by the military and the shabiha , armed pro-regime elements , opened fire in what he called an " intense " situation			1
the witness provided the names of nine slain people , whose bodies were seized by pro-regime people , and estimated the number of casualties at around 100			0
another witness there reported at least one demonstration in which tens of thousands of people took to the streets			0
the witness said people were heading toward a square in the center of town and chanted , " @entity59 , freedom ! national unity ! @entity62 and @entity63 are one ! leave , leave " and , " the people want the fall of the regime			0
" that same witness later reported small demonstrations in some areas , with protesters burning tires amid intermittent gunfire			1
@entity21 said the wounded were being treated in private clinics , and while he 's unclear about the situation at the city 's main hospital , he said the medics he was talking to were in tears			0
@entity0 ca n't independently confirm the accounts			0
the @entity81 government of @entity82 , who once ruled @entity4 , crushed the 1982 revolt in @entity18 against the @entity84 , who are the majority religious group in @entity4			1
estimates put the death toll then at between 10,000 and 30,000 people ; the exact number was never known			0
the government has been dominated by the @entity93 's @entity92 community , a minority religious group that is an offshoot of @entity96			1
the @entity18 protests erupted after this week 's friday @entity99 prayers , which were dedicated to the children who have taken part in the persistent and angry uprising against the @entity4 government			1
at least 51 children have been killed by security forces since the anti-government protests started in mid-march , according to the @entity107			1
they include @entity108 , the 13 - year - old @entity15 boy whose killing has captured the world 's attention , and a 4 - year - old shot in @entity114 , a town in restive @entity116 province			2
the overall death toll in @entity114 has reached 80 , the coordination group said , and an activist near @entity114 said he heard the sounds of gunfire and artillery overnight			0
an eyewitness in @entity114 said there was n't a call to prayer friday , people could not leave their homes and there were no demonstrations because security personnel promptly shelled gatherings when they saw them			1
demonstrations after friday prayers have energized the opposition in @entity4 and every week there have been different protest themes			1
the focus on children dovetails with the outcry over @entity108 's death			2
@entity142 reflected the worldwide outrage toward the @entity4 regime when said he is " deeply troubled by the continued serious violations of human rights , including disturbing reports of the deaths of children under torture , live ammunition and shelling			1
" he also said that many people have been injured and thousands arrested over nearly three months			0
while noting the " announcement by the @entity4 authorities of an amnesty and the establishment of a committee to establish a national dialogue , " @entity142 emphasized that " violent repression by security and military forces must end immediately for a genuine and inclusive dialogue to take place and lead to the comprehensive reforms and change called for by the @entity4 people			1
" @entity168 , the @entity2 children 's agency , said this week that since mid-march , " reports of children injured , detained , displaced and at times killed have been increasing			2
" it said the use of live ammunition on demonstrators has reportedly killed at least 30 children , but it has n't been able to independently verify casualty figures and the " circumstances of their death			0
" it said @entity4 is a party to the @entity182 and " has an obligation to ensure children 's right to life " their safety and other human rights , such as freedom of expression			1
" we are particularly disturbed by the recent video images of children who were arbitrarily detained and suffered torture or ill - treatment during their detention , leading in some cases to their death			2
we call on the government to thoroughly investigate these reports and ensure that perpetrators of such horrific acts are identified and brought to justice , " the agency said			0
another group caught in the middle of the discord in @entity4 is the @entity209 refugee community , an estimated 1 million people , according to the @entity211			1
they fled to @entity4 during the war in @entity209			2
the organization said friday that there is " growing concern " of an influx of people returning to @entity209			0
it is working with government authorities and other humanitarian groups to prepare for immediate and long - term help for those people and the communities hosting them			2
there have not been " significant " increases in returns , but " smaller - scale returns have been reported , primarily in @entity229 and @entity230 , " the group said			2
migration organization monitors in @entity230 last month learned that " 126 families had returned from @entity4 due to violence and instability			2
interviews are currently being conducted with these and other returnee families to better understand their reasons for return and their future intentions			0
" " with nearly one million @entity209 still displaced within the country , the possibility of a major increase in returns from @entity4 poses a considerable challenge to @entity209 's stability , " said the @entity211 's @entity209 chief of mission , @entity240			1
" @entity211 remains committed to working with the government to closely monitor the return situation and , if necessary , provide immediate assistance to vulnerable returnees , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 contributed to this report			0
