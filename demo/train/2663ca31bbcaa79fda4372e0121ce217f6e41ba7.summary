what would it be like to wear @entity2 ? @entity3 answered that very question wednesday morning , posting a lot more information about @entity2 , including the user interface , through a series of photos and videos			1
you can see the @entity12 and some of the features of @entity2 here , although the images do n't quite capture the exact experience			0
the headset does n't actually have lenses in front of your eyes , just a small screen ( viewable via a mirrored glass block ) above and to the right of the wearer 's right eye			0
as such , the point - of - view images that show a large action window in the center of the field of view are a little misleading			0
still , the photos , posted on @entity3 's @entity2 website , show more about how @entity2 works than any photo of the hardware could convey			1
this video shows even more : commanding the headset is as easy as uttering the words " ok , @entity2 , " a clever use of real - world speech to engage the device 's listening mode			1
see also : how @entity2 could change advertising once engaged , @entity2 is capable of taking photos , recording videos , looking up answers on @entity3 , showing reminders ( such as for a flight ) and sharing whatever you 're looking at â€” either via messaging or through a @entity51			2
as @entity3 co-founder @entity52 himself revealed previously , @entity2 will also have an automatic picture - taking mode , snapping pics at a preset intervals ( such as every 5 seconds )			2
@entity3 also launched a contest with its own hashtag ( # ifihadglass ) , challenging anyone to come up with creative uses for @entity2 that can be explained in 50 words or fewer			1
winners will get the chance to buy their own , along with developers , when they become available			0
the price : $ 1,500 , plus tax			0
are you impressed with how @entity2 works ? let us know in the comments .			2
