-- when @entity2 unleashed the flood of classified documents and surveillance data secreted from @entity7 spy agencies earlier this year , it is unclear if he anticipated the high - level damage it would do to @entity7 international relations			1
headlines have focused on irate calls by heads of state to president @entity14 and parliamentary moves to restore privacy			2
diplomats have been summoned to repair fractured relationships			2
and just this week , the @entity20 ' senior counterterrorism special rapporteur , @entity21 , announced that he would launch an investigation into the surveillance tactics used by @entity7 and @entity25 intelligence agencies citing the @entity2 leaks at " the very apex of public interest concerns			1
" yet for all the ruckus globally , the most enduring damage from omnipresent surveillance may be right here at home			2
early evidence suggests that knowing that our e-mails , phone calls and social media circles are being vacuumed up into a giant government database may reshape what we say and write , and whom we associate with			2
surveillance may be chipping away not just at our privacy , but at the @entity7 values of freedom of expression and association enshrined in the @entity47			1
invasion of privacy or no big deal ? yet while foreign politicians are up in arms , many @entity7 are shrugging their shoulders			1
there have been lawsuits , bills introduced in @entity56 and even a few public demonstrations			0
but surveys from @entity59 indicate that the @entity61 programs are actually supported by roughly half of @entity7 , even though many believe that their own personal e-mails and calls have been read or listened to			1
however , a survey of @entity7 writers done in october revealed that nearly one in four has self - censored for fear of government surveillance			1
they fessed up to curbing their research , not accepting certain assignments , even not discussing certain topics on the phone or via e-mail for fear of being targeted			2
the subjects they are avoiding are no surprise -- mostly matters to do with the @entity82 , the military and terrorism			0
because they rely on free expression for their work and livelihoods , some writers may be more prone to caution in what they say and who they say it to for fear of activating an @entity61 tripwire			1
but as awareness of mass surveillance sets in for the general public , it is hard to imagine the rest of us will be far behind			0
in a country that has prided itself for the world 's staunchest protections of free speech and association , certain subjects , names , and ideas may become virtually off - limits for all those who 'd rather not tangle with the @entity61			0
topics that are foreign , alien or frightening may become all the more so if researchers , writers , journalists and even students are afraid to investigate and explain them			2
surveillance so intrusive it is putting certain subjects out of bounds would seem like cause for alarm in a country that prides itself as the world 's most free			0
@entity7 have long protested the persecution and constraints on journalists and writers living under repressive regimes abroad , yet many seem ready to accept these new encroachments on their freedom at home			1
we 've already given it away some @entity7 ' relative nonchalance toward the government prying into e-mails and calls we long thought were private may stem in part from knowing that we have already ceded so much of our privacy voluntarily			1
social media , online shopping , and simple browsing have become semi-public acts			0
it 's hard to know who can see what , and worrying about it can stand in the way of buying a birthday present , posting a great photo or getting your taxes done			0
moreover , for most @entity7 , learning that the government is a lurking hidden online " friend " does n't evoke the fears it would have in communist @entity152 or today 's @entity154 or @entity153			1
because we are all subject to the @entity61 's intrusions , there is no single group -- not @entity160 , or african - americans , or people of @entity82 descent -- that has emerged as a target of these newly revealed programs			0
while @entity7 are used to fighting against discrimination , we are less accustomed to standing up for rights to privacy , expression and association that belong to us all			1
finally , because of the utter secrecy of the programs -- schemes we would not even know about short of @entity2 's astonishing breach -- unless you 're @entity176 you would n't know whether you were under investigation , questioned at the airport , or denied a visa because of something you said or wrote			1
it may be years , if ever , before stories come to light of people done in by their own texts , web - surfing or @entity188 posts			0
did it really matter ? when the @entity2 story first broke , @entity14 claimed that the newly exposed programs had foiled 50 terrorist plots			1
after reading through a classified list of the thwarted assaults , sen. @entity193 called the figure " plainly wrong			0
" in the few cases where details have been released , journalists and intelligence experts have argued that the evidence gathered through surveillance could have been obtained in other ways , or was n't crucial			0
not all surveillance powers are bad			0
the @entity56 and courts have , for decades , focused on where to draw the boundaries to ensure that both we and our constitutional rights are kept safe			0
with new and expansive surveillance technologies , and new evidence that our most treasured rights may be at risk , the public is depending on judges and representatives to demand the information they need to properly weigh up the purported benefits of surveillance , as well as its harms			0
@entity7 should n't be out - outraged by the international community about a program that puts our own liberties at risks			1
the public 's dulled senses when it comes to online privacy should not be grounds for forfeiting the rights the @entity233 put first above all others			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			2

@entity237 : @entity2 has done damage to international relations
@entity237 : some writers have begun censoring themselves out of fear
@entity237 : still , many average @entity7 may not see the intrusion as that big of a deal
