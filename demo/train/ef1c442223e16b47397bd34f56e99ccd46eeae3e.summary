-- former world no. 1 @entity1 overcame current top - ranked player @entity2 in an epic clash to reach the final of the @entity6 open on friday			1
however , hopes of an all - @entity9 showdown were dashed when the return to form of another previous no. 1 , @entity12 , was ended by @entity14 @entity13 in the other semifinal in @entity16			1
@entity1 , who won the clay tournament in 2007 and 2008 , followed up her quarterfinal victory over @entity2 's fourth - seeded older sister @entity19 by triumphing 4 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) in two and three - quarter hours			1
the seventh seed fought back from 3 - 0 and 4 - 2 down to save a match - point in the deciding tie - breaker as she overcame what seemed like delaying tactics by the @entity25 when serving on a vital point			2
" i was just getting ready to serve and i was serving and all of a sudden she was n't ready , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" for me when the server comes to play the receiver has to be ready -- that 's the rules			0
" but unfortunately i had to hit another serve , regroup and refocus because i did n't want to waste my energy on that			0
" @entity2 was seeking to repeat her 2002 @entity16 triumph in what was her first tournament since winning the @entity37 in late january , injuring her knee in doing so			2
" i almost feel like i won that match			0
i ca n't be really upset , but i am , " she said			0
" i feel i should have won -- i could have won			0
but i ca n't beat myself up over it , i 've just come back and had n't played a match since january			0
" @entity12 , who has slumped to 58th in the rankings since winning the @entity43 in 2008 , was seeking to reach her first @entity45 final since march 2009			2
but she was unable to show the form that this week knocked out ninth seed @entity47 and @entity50 champion @entity49 as she was crushed 6 - 4 6 - 2 by world no. 26 @entity13			1
her 27 - year - old opponent followed up her own upset win over world no. 2 @entity54 on wednesday by reaching her third @entity45 final			1
she won minor clay tournaments in @entity58 and @entity59 last year , and lost in the final in @entity61 the year before			0
@entity13 has played @entity1 only twice , winning on hardcourt in 2001 when the @entity9 retired hurt and losing on clay last year in the @entity66 teams event .			1

@entity1 beats world no. 1 @entity2 in three - set epic to reach @entity6 @entity37 final
@entity1 will play @entity13 , who beat her *fellow* @entity9 @entity12
the @entity14 also knocked out world no. 2 @entity54 earlier in the clay event
@entity1 is seeking to win tournament for the third time , having triumphed in 2007 and 2008
