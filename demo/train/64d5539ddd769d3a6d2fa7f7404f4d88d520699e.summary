@entity0 -- an elephant never forgets , they say , especially a veteran political one like @entity6 sen. @entity5			1
the @entity8 conservative known for his hawkish views claimed a policy victory thursday over the man who beat him in the 2008 presidential election			0
he took to the @entity16 floor to declare himself right for opposing president @entity18 's decision to pull @entity20 forces out of @entity21 in 2011			2
" now we know what happens when we left @entity21			0
now we know the consequences , " @entity5 said			2
" i hope that all those people that called me all of the names that i am not going to repeat here would render an apology because i was right ! because i said if we leave @entity21 completely then , we risk the great danger of it deteriorating			0
" the night before , @entity5 tore into former @entity33 press secretary @entity32 in a live interview after @entity18 announced escalated military steps in @entity21 and @entity36 to take on @entity38 extremists			1
their argument involved @entity18 's policies in @entity21 and @entity36 during his first term , with @entity5 blaming the president for the current crisis and berating @entity32 for " bragging " about withdrawing @entity20 troops from @entity21 in 2011			1
the exchange , with @entity5 repeatedly cutting @entity32 off and calling him a liar , came on @entity32 's first night as a @entity1 analyst			1
here 's a look at what they said : 1 ) @entity5 said @entity18 rejected calls by his entire national security team to arm @entity36 rebels this is partly true			1
then - secretary of state @entity58 and others in the administration wanted to send weapons and other aid to @entity36 opposition groups considered moderate to bolster their fight against government forces of president @entity67			0
however , some voices inside and out of the administration opposed such a move , arguing that extremist elements in the opposition , including @entity74 affiliates , could wind up with the @entity20 hardware			0
at the time , @entity5 and fellow war hawks pushed loudly for arming the @entity36 rebels and criticized @entity18 for deciding against it			1
on wednesday night , @entity5 took umbrage with @entity32 's assertion that the @entity36 opposition was too informal and splintered to pick partners for aid back in 2012			1
asked by @entity1 anchor @entity83 about @entity18 's speech , @entity5 quickly veered off to attack @entity32			1
" by the way , i 'm astounded that mr. @entity32 should say that the @entity86 is now stronger			2
in fact , they have been badly damaged , " @entity5 said			2
when @entity32 replied that he had merely noted the @entity20 now had more information on the rebels , @entity5 shot back : " come on , @entity32 , we knew all about them then			1
you just did n't choose to know			0
" " your boss , when the entire national security team wanted to arm and train them , he turned them down , mr. @entity32 , " @entity5 continued			1
@entity32 interjected that the two should " agree to disagree on this , " but @entity5 kept going , asserting @entity18 made " the unilateral decision " to turn down " the entire national security team			1
" 2 ) @entity5 said @entity18 's decision to withdraw @entity20 forces from @entity21 led to the current crisis the withdrawal contributed to conditions that resulted in @entity38 fighters rampaging through northern @entity21 from @entity36 , but other factors also played a role			1
for example , critics accused former prime minister @entity113 of consolidating power and persecuting political rivals , blaming him for fueling @entity21 's problems with sectarian policies that alienated @entity118			0
@entity5 's main point was that @entity18 brought home all the @entity20 troops instead of leaving a residual force of at least several thousand to help maintain stability			1
" the fact he did n't leave a residual force in @entity21 , overruling all of his military advisers , is the reason we 're facing @entity38 today , " said the senator			0
while military leaders called for keeping a limited @entity20 contingent in @entity21 , the @entity18 administration needed a security agreement with the @entity21 government to do so			2
no such agreement emerged , and @entity32 said the result was fulfillment of withdrawal plans dating back to the previous administration of @entity6 president @entity140			0
" you are again saying facts that are patently false , " @entity5 responded , arguing the @entity21 wanted a residual @entity20 deployment but @entity18 never supported such a result			1
" and you in your role as a spokesperson bragged about the fact that the last @entity20 combat troop had left @entity21 , " he continued			0
" if we had left a residual force , the situation would not be what it is today			0
" @entity32 responded that @entity5 presented " facts that you believe are true based on the argument that you have made for a long time , sir , that we should leave troops in @entity21 in perpetuity			2
" " that is just not what this president believes , " @entity32 said			0
" obviously he was elected president to fulfill what he believed was right for our country and right for our national security			0
" @entity5 repeatedly cut him off and accused him of distortion			1
when @entity32 said he understood that @entity5 disagreed , the senator shot back : " it is not a matter of disagreement			2
it is a matter of facts			0
and you have yours wrong and you have distorted			0
" @entity179 candidates finding distance from @entity18 on @entity38 @entity181 : @entity20 not at war with @entity38			0

sen. @entity5 and former @entity18 spokesman clash on *tv*
it was @entity32 's first night as a @entity1 analyst
@entity5 repeatedly cuts @entity32 off and accuses him of lying
" i was right , " @entity5 declares
