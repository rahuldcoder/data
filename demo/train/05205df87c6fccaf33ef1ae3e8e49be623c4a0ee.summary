-- built like a wrestler , when @entity3 says " do n't call me baby , " you 'd be advised to listen			1
the 21 - year - old has had enough with the tennis world labeling him as " @entity7 " following comparisons with 17 - time grand slam champion @entity9			1
after winning the @entity13 and @entity14 junior titles in 2008 , his coach @entity10 at the time hailed @entity3 as the next @entity9 -- a man who the former @entity16 player had worked with previously			1
it was supposed to be a compliment -- a warning to the rest of the world that @entity22 had unearthed a tennis player ready to emulate one of the greatest to have ever picked up a racket			1
but @entity10 's comment has weighed heavily on @entity3 's shoulders ever since with the watching world awaiting his rise to stardom			1
it was @entity10 who oversaw @entity9 's first 10 @entity34 @entity34 titles and his first grand slam title win at @entity14 at 2003			0
and while @entity3 would love to follow in the @entity38 star 's footsteps , he wants to make it clear that he is his own man -- not @entity9 mark two			1
" you know , all the comparisons , i think that i definitely want people to stop with that , " he told @entity0 's @entity41			0
" of course we have some similarities here and there			0
i 'm flattered with that and actually , i thought it was really cool at the beginning			0
" but with time , i 've realized what i am			0
it 's something that is definitely not what the other person is , so i 'm trying to build up my own style and when i 'm on court , i do my own shots			2
" i think that 's eventually what everyone will see			0
" @entity3 has been plotting his rise to the top since the very first time he stepped onto a court as a child with his father @entity67 , a tennis coach in their native city of @entity70			1
his single - handed backhand , which is so unusual among players of his age group , was honed under his father 's gaze			2
" i actually never thought of any other sport , " said @entity3 , recalling his formative years			1
" my father was a tennis coach and my mum was a former volleyball player , so i was in the sport area in general			1
" but the only thing i was always telling my parents was : ' i just want to play tennis			2
' " obviously , my dad showed me a few shots			0
i was six or seven and i was just playing regularly			0
" such was @entity3 's talent during his teenage years that he was soon off to @entity86 to train at the prestigious @entity87 just outside of @entity88			1
it was there that he began to show glimpses of his future potential , winning a whole host of junior tournaments on his way to becoming the third youngest player to break into the world 's top 100 in 2011			2
but it was his decision to leave @entity86 to join up with the " @entity101 " in @entity16 last november which has helped propel his career to the next level			2
working alongside ex-world @entity108 @entity104 and the former doubles partnership of @entity106 and @entity107 , @entity3 reached the @entity111 final before losing to @entity113 @entity112 in january			1
" all the guys from @entity115 are amazing and all of them have incredible experiences from the tour , " @entity3 said			1
" they all have something to bring to the table so that makes it a lot more interesting			0
" you take a little from this one , pick a little from that one , and then the next thing you know , you 're getting sort of completed and , that helps you during the weeks			0
" while @entity3 has yet to propel himself into the top 10 -- he has reached a career - high 28th this year -- he has begun to show signs of improvement , most noticeably during last month 's @entity130			1
the young pretender gave @entity132 one of the toughest tests on clay that the seven - time @entity137 champion has endured in recent years			1
a full - blooded display against the undisputed king of the surface was eventually curtailed by defeat in three sets , but the fruits of his labor were bared for all to see			2
" i had kind of rough matches in the past weeks so it gave me of course a lot of confidence , even though i lost them , " @entity3 said			1
" i felt quite good about myself and the way i was progressing and of course , these hours in the gym			0
" they 're just a must			0
you just kind of do it and it does n't matter if it 's sunday or saturday , you 've just got to do what you 've got to do			0
" i mean basically , you 've got to make it			0
" away from the court , and when he 's not working out , @entity3 has plenty of other interests to keep him busy			1
while he remains coy on his private life , having been linked romantically to women 's tennis stars @entity163 and @entity166 in the past , he is more than happy to divulge his other extracurricular activities			1
" i enjoy good food , " he said			2
" that 's one of the things			0
i love good restaurants and i love cars and all these things			2
" we 're away for 25 weeks a year so you appreciate the time when you 're off			0
" if you can get it with friends and family and you know , people around that you thought you had n't seen for a while , it 's always good			0
" of course if you get the chance to go somewhere to get a few days away here and there , i mean i 'd definitely get that			0
