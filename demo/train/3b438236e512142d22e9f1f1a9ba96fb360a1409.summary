-- sen. @entity1 is not a bomb thrower			1
as the head of the @entity5 she has , for instance , been a stalwart public defender of the @entity7 's controversial bulk collection of phone data in the @entity9			0
that is why the verbal hand grenade she threw on the @entity5 floor on tuesday is a device sufficiently explosive that it may represent the largest rupture between @entity17 and the @entity18 since the @entity20 hearings of the mid- 1970s , in which @entity18 officials were summoned to testify publicly about the agency 's dirty tricks , such as its plan to assassinate @entity26 dictator @entity25			0
in an angry speech , @entity1 asserted that the @entity18 has violated federal laws by covertly removing classified documents from her committee 's computers as it pursued a multiyear investigation of the @entity18 's interrogation and detention programs			1
@entity1 said that four years ago the @entity18 removed hundreds of pages of documents that were being reviewed by her staff on computers at a @entity18 facility set up for the @entity5 staff 's use in @entity42			1
@entity1 says @entity18 spied on @entity5 computers in 2009 , @entity1 , a @entity44 from @entity45 , assumed chairmanship of the @entity5 , which provides oversight on all 16 of the @entity9 intelligence agencies , including the @entity18			2
from that position @entity1 has often sided with the @entity18 on issues that are important to the agency , for instance , defending the @entity18 's use of armed drones to kill suspected terrorists in @entity56 and @entity57			2
if @entity1 's allegation about the @entity18 search of her committee 's computers is correct , such an intrusion would likely violate laws that prevent the @entity18 from conducting domestic surveillance , not to mention that it would constitute a potential violation of the separation of powers			1
walking with the help of a cane after a recent fall on black ice , cia director @entity67 made a rare public speech tuesday at the @entity73 in which he denied the charge			0
" as far as the allegations of @entity18 hacking into @entity5 computers -- nothing could be further from the truth			0
we would n't do that			0
" this dispute between the @entity5 and the @entity18 is , in fact , part of a much larger dispute about the @entity5 's investigation of the agency 's post- 9/11 secret overseas prisons housing @entity89 detainees and the @entity18 interrogation program for those prisoners , some of whom were subjected to coercive techniques such as waterboarding			2
the yet - to - be released 6,300 - page report by the @entity5 pours cold water on @entity18 claims that coercive interrogations yielded a great deal of useful information about @entity89 plots and saved lives			1
in fact , according to one @entity9 official familiar with the report , when so - called " enhanced interrogation techniques " were used on one of @entity108 's captured couriers , @entity106 , they were actually counterproductive			0
@entity106 was cooperative before these techniques were used , but he stopped talking after he was subjected to coercive interrogations			0
the official said the @entity18 also misled president @entity112 and vice president @entity113 about the efficacy of these coercive techniques			0
the @entity18 has prepared its own secret 122 - page rebuttal of the @entity5 report			1
the @entity5 report also undercuts the claim that the hunt for @entity108 was helped by detainees in @entity18 custody who were subjected to coercive interrogations and that led the agency to focus on one of @entity108 's couriers , a notion that was popularized in the @entity127 - nominated film " @entity128			1
" @entity1 released a statement in 2012 saying , " the @entity18 did not first learn about the existence of the @entity108 courier from @entity18 detainees subjected to coercive interrogation techniques			2
nor did the @entity18 discover the courier 's identity from detainees subjected to coercive techniques			0
... instead , the @entity18 learned of the existence of the courier , his true name and location through means unrelated to the @entity18 detention and interrogation program			0
" if any good can come of this dispute one can only hope that a 300 - page summary of the @entity5 report is released in some declassified form so the @entity9 public and the world can finally get a better sense of how useful the @entity18 detention and interrogation programs really were			1
to get this longstanding controversy resolved , the @entity155 @entity154 should show some real leadership on the issue and step in to push all sides for the release -- at the very least -- of a declassified version of the 300 - page summary of the @entity5 report as well as a similarly declassified version of the @entity18 's rebuttal .			1

sen. @entity1 accuses @entity18 of covertly removing documents from her staff 's computers
@entity171 : *feinstein* *longtime* @entity18 supporter , so her statements are n't easily dismissed
her staff 's report disputes @entity18 claims that coercive interrogations yielded useful info
@entity171 : @entity154 should step up and get summary of 6,000 - page report released
