their sons -- @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 -- have become symbols of a raging national conversation about police brutality and racial injustice			1
the mothers of these four unarmed black men and boys felled by bullets or excessive police force have no doubt their sons would still be alive if they were white			1
no question , they say			2
" i think absolutely my son 's race and the color of his skin had a lot to do with why he was shot and killed , " @entity17 , @entity2 's mother , told @entity19 's @entity18 on friday			1
" in all of these cases , these victims were unarmed			1
these victims were african - american			1
that needs to be our conversation			2

they spoke of reliving the horrific final moments of their son 's lives with each controversial death , of gaining strength from protesters and other supporters , of the importance of coming together to effect change			1
" it seems our kids are getting younger and younger , " @entity31 said			2
" they 're killing them younger and younger			2
there is no regard anymore for human life			2
there has to be somewhere where we draw the line and say , ' listen , our kids want to grow up , too			0
' " @entity38 said she had confidence in a federal investigation into whether her son 's civil rights were violated			1
a @entity67 grand jury last week refused to indict a white police officer in the death of her son , was put in a fatal chokehold by the officer as he tried to arrest @entity5 for illegally selling cigarettes			1
" if @entity5 was a white man in @entity78 doing the same thing that he was doing -- even if he would have been caught selling cigarettes that day -- they would have given him a summons and he would n't have lost his life that day , " she said			1
" i believe that 100 percent			0
" @entity31 's son was shot and killed in @entity83 in february 2012 by @entity84 , a volunteer neighborhood watch captain			1
the case quickly drew national attention as weeks went by without formal charges			0
" we have to change mindsets , " @entity31 said			0
" we have to let people know that our children matter			0
our sons and our daughters matter			0
" demonstrations followed @entity84 's acquittal even though some people around the country supported @entity84 's actions			1
" it 's not happening to them , so they do n't quite get it , " she said			1
" they do n't quite understand			0
they think that it 's a small group of african - americans that 's complaining			1
... the people say that all the time : ' what are they complaining about now ? what are they protesting about now ? ' " to those people , @entity31 said : " until it happens to them and in their family then they 'll understand the walk			0
they do n't understand what we 're going through			0
they do n't understand the life and they do n't understand what we 're fighting against			0
i do n't even think the government quite gets it			0
" president @entity129 publicly addressed the @entity2 case , as he did last summer 's shooting of @entity3 -- an unarmed teenager shot to death by white police officer @entity135			1
a @entity137 grand jury declined to bring charges against the officer , leading to days of unrest in @entity141 , @entity142			0
" i was ( sure ) they would indict the officer that shot my son without a video tape , " @entity34 said			0
" you had so many witnesses			0
" the death of @entity4 , a 12 - year - old boy shot last month by a @entity152 officer after police allegedly mistook the child 's air gun for a real firearm , has also drawn national attention			1
the @entity159 's @entity158 said friday it has ruled the death a homicide			1
@entity36 , his mother , said she found out about the shooting after two boys knocked on her door			2
" the police shot your son in the stomach , " she recalled one of the boys saying			0
one of her daughters was handcuffed and thrown into the back of a police car when she protested the shooting , said @entity36			0
she described going out to the street and seeing her son on the ground and " nobody ... doing anything " to help him			0
one of the @entity4 's sisters screamed , " they killed my baby brother ! " attorney @entity182 , who has represented some of the mothers , said police cared more about preserving the crime scene than trying to save @entity4 's life			1
@entity31 said each new tragedy brings people together			0
" i think this is shedding light to what 's going on , " @entity31 said of the protest movement that has risen out of the tragedies			2
" this is not something new			0
... but it 's just been bringing light to what 's happening			2
it 's bringing it to the forefront which is why there 's so much conversations			2
... because people are now realizing ... it 's not just about @entity209 rights ... it 's about human rights			1
" @entity38 asked , " what are they doing to our children today ? " @entity31 said she has a son graduating from college next week			2
" i want him to enjoy life and fulfill his life and goals , but at the same time i 'm afraid for him , " she said .			0
