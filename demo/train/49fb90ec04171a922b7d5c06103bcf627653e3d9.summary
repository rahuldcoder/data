-- the town of @entity2 , @entity3 , is tiny			1
the population barely reaches 7,000 , and the smattering of tourists it attracts throughout the year are undoubtedly lured by its rustic , small - town charm			1
its handful of attractions include some vintage hot spring resorts ( @entity13 , the town was a hotspot for wellness tourism ) , some nearby ghost towns and roaming buffalo			2
" here , you 're in the middle of what i consider to be the real @entity24 , " says @entity19 , mayor of @entity2 ( or @entity2 , as it 's known locally )			1
" it 's a back - to - nature kind of place			2
i love to take my four - wheel drive and head out into the wilderness , where there are 100 - mile vistas			0
there 's nothing like it in the continuous @entity35			0
" not surprisingly , @entity2 lacks the name recognition of , say , @entity37 or @entity38			1
that is set to change in the next couple of years however , as the town is on the brink of becoming the epicenter for space tourism			1
@entity45 -- which next year is slated to send a troupe of multi-millionaires up into the stratosphere when @entity49 moves in -- is a mere 30 miles to the northeast			1
" @entity45 employs 1,300 people across @entity3 , and we 're looking to add another 1,800 jobs by 2018 , " says @entity51 , executive director of @entity45 and the @entity52			1
with an additional 200,000 yearly visitors projected once @entity49 moves in -- and the @entity45 completes its @entity57 ( which @entity59 estimates will take another 16 months to finish ) -- @entity60 or @entity61 is likely to experience a serious uptick			1
in fact , experts estimate the population is likely to double			2
quiz : do you have what it takes to be a space tourist ? " the number that i 've seen that scares me the most is 3,000 people in our downtown on a saturday , " admits @entity19			0
currently , the potential of space tourism has everyone in the area on high alert			2
@entity49 are meeting with local tourism suppliers next month to help ready them for the supposed onslaught , while @entity2 has embarked on a mission to spruce up ahead of its visitors			1
" we 're working hard to make the town more attractive , but at the same time , we do n't want it to lose its character			2
we do n't want a 5 - star hotel in downtown , " he says			0
still , it 's difficult to imagine @entity93 's clients , many of whom have paid $ 250,000 for their ticket to space , feeling content staying at the local budget hotel			0
" i would say there 's plenty of hotels to handle the initial amount of space tourists , but i do n't think there is anything ( in the luxury market ) , " says dr. @entity100 , an assistant professor at the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103			0

in april , @entity0 founder @entity121 bought @entity60 or @entity61 's @entity122 -- one of the few upscale accommodations in the region -- but other investors seem to be playing wait - and - see			0
" we are lagging in terms of business investment , " admits @entity19 , though he maintains he 's not worried about the future of @entity60 or @entity128 " this is the most amazing , iconic facility in the world , but it 's like anything else : you have to see it to believe it , and that 's true of investment			0
investment follows opportunity , it does n't really lead opportunity			0
" @entity145 , the @entity3 state tourism secretary , says that developers have been scoping out the area ever since the @entity45 was first proposed			1
the challenge , she says , wo n't be luring investors , so much as ensuring the region keeps its charms			0
" if there are luxury resorts , they still need to be true to what makes @entity3 so unique , because that 's what 's going to keep it a special experience for the people that visit , " she says .			0

@entity45 expects 200,000 yearly visitors once @entity49 moves in
the population boom could change the area , which remains *remote*
the nearest town , @entity2 , has 7,000 *residents*
