president @entity1 's news conferences are n't at all like news conferences i used to attend in @entity4 , when i covered the @entity5			1
first , there are the stuffed animals			0
since there are more than 1,200 journalists in the giant hall , they have to attract president @entity1 's attention some way , so some bring stuffed animals , raise home - made signs , or wear t - shirts specially printed up to advertise the region or news organization they come from			1
then there 's the length of the conference			0
this one was the usual length -- three and a half hours			0
this was @entity1 's 10th news conference and it could n't have happened at a worse time			1
as the @entity35 say , the smell of kerosene was in the air			2
the value of the @entity35 currency , the ruble , was dropping like a stone , the @entity37 and @entity38 were just announcing yet more sanctions , @entity35 was on the verse of a recession , but the president refused to call it a " crisis			2
" striding into the hall , @entity1 appeared cool , calm and collected			2
close - ups of the president 's face were broadcast on two giant screens on either side of the hall , his every glance , every gesture visible			0
@entity1 's first challenge was to assure his fellow citizens that @entity35 can overcome what he called an " unfavorable scenario " and he promised that would happen -- in two years , maybe less			1
there was no real mea culpa for @entity35 's economic predicament			2
@entity1 admitted only that the @entity65 and the government could have reacted more quickly to the economic challenges			0
instead , he blamed @entity35 's economic woes on " external " factors , asserting that economic sanctions account for just " 25 to 30 % " of @entity35 's economic problems			2
when a @entity73 reporter asked him about a " new " @entity74 , @entity1 leaned forward like an athlete , insisting that that @entity35 is simply defending its own interests			1
@entity77 , he said , has only two military bases outside its territory but the @entity37 has bases " all over the world			0
" they told us there would be no @entity86 expansion , he complained , and now the @entity87 is building new virtual walls around @entity35			0
@entity1 is adept at turning the tables			1
one journalist asked him about reprisals by @entity93 authorities against the families of alleged terrorists , accusing @entity35 's government - financed tv channels of igniting hatred in society			2
@entity1 quickly pointed to the torture report just released by the @entity5			0
the @entity37 he said , " legalized torture " and even developed a method for carrying it out			0
" how do you explain that ? " he asked indignantly			0
@entity1 spoke for several minutes on the image of the @entity35 " bear			1
" the @entity87 , he claimed , wo n't leave the bear in peace , but wants to " chain " it , " de-claw it , " unless it sits obediently in the forest , eating berries			0
if there was one promising note , it was the @entity35 president 's statement that the conflict in eastern @entity118 should be settled peacefully			1
he acknowledged that there were @entity35 in eastern @entity118 , but they were " volunteers			1
" surprisingly , the president called on some journalists who are not known as being friendly to the @entity122 and there were some uncomfortable questions			0
when @entity1 said there 's a " fine line " between the opposition and a " @entity132 " -- in other words , traitors to @entity35 -- reporters twice followed up with pointed questions , including a demand that he name those members of the " @entity132			1
others asked him what is the salary of @entity137 , head of the @entity35 oil giant @entity138 ? he said he did n't know			2
in one of the most dramatic questions , a @entity35 reporter asked @entity1 if he is worried that members of his inner circle could carry out a " palace coup ? " @entity1 , who in spite of his somewhat fierce image abroad , does have a sense of humor , defused the question with a smile			1
" we ca n't have a palace coup because we have no palaces , " he said			1
stability is based on support of the @entity35 people , he said , and " the people believe we are acting in their interest			0

@entity1 's first challenge was to assure @entity35 they can overcome an " unfavorable scenario "
the @entity35 president said the @entity118 conflict should be settled peacefully
@entity1 is adept at turning the tables , writes @entity167
@entity1 : " we ca n't have a palace coup because we have no palaces "
