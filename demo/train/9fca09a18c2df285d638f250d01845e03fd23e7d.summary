the curtain has n't even opened on @entity2 's new dvd - by - mail spin - off company @entity3 , and many customers are already walking out			1
the company recently revised its quarterly projections of net subscribers to show 1 million fewer customers than it had previously expected			0
much to @entity2 's chagrin , folks are realizing that the king of mail - away media is n't the only game in town			1
we 've taken a look at some of @entity2 's ( and @entity3 's ) main competitors , and judged each service accordingly			0
do the rest offer enough to stand up to the best ? @entity2 / @entity3 also known as @entity2 : redux			0
it 's the same service we know and love , only completely different			0
faced with massive customer backlash in the wake of a price hike , @entity2 split itself into two separate companies this week			0
the streaming service will retain the @entity2 branding while the dvd - by - mail service will be named @entity3			1
@entity2 ceo @entity32 said the split will better serve customers in the long run because each company will be able to better focus on one type of service			0
@entity2 pioneered the dvd - by - mail service , creating an entire industry where one did not exist previously			1
but after serious flux in @entity2 's new pricing system — which split the streaming and dvd mailing services into two separate plans starting at $ 8 a month minimum — there 's no guarantee the company 's customers will continue to stick around			1
wired : it 's been around the longest , and is the most familiar service			0
massive offering of physical mail - away media			1
new game rental service sounds intriguing			0
streaming to all @entity59 devices and @entity61 smartphones			1
tired : can you say price increase ? we do n't like paying more money for the same service , and we 're failing to see how splitting the companies in twain is going to benefit consumers			0
streaming - only service still lacks selection compared to @entity45 catalog			1
@entity73 @entity73 's elite - level service launched in 2005 , offering two - day shipping on any of its products to members anywhere in the continental @entity79 and other select countries for a reasonable $ 80 a year			1
originally meant for those who could n't wait more than 48 hours for their tangible goods , @entity73 expanded in february to offer instant , streaming movie and tv show access to existing @entity73 customers at no added cost			1
wired : fast shipping on everything @entity73 ! what other movie service offers that ? lower yearly rate than @entity2 and @entity3			1
works with over 100 different web - connected set - top boxes , including the ever - popular @entity96			1
tired : smaller media selection compared to other existing services			0
lacks the dvd rental option that made @entity2 famous			1
@entity100 @entity100 made it possible for legions of supermarket shoppers to pick up a movie on the cheap , without having to make multiple stops			1
instead of leaving the grocery store ( or 7 - 11 , @entity108 or what have you ) with only a tv dinner and a @entity112 in tow , @entity100 's 30,000 - plus dvd - rental kiosks make sure you wo n't go home alone on a friday night again			1
wired : cheap , cheap , cheap			1
dvd rentals average two bucks a pop , with anywhere from 50 to 200 recent titles to select from in each kiosk , updated weekly			0
game rentals to roll out this year			0
tired : no streaming service ? bummer			1
@entity123 once the dominant force in the media - rental industry , @entity123 has fared horribly over the past few years			1
after scoffing at @entity2 's business model years ago , the big blue - and - gold company filed for bankruptcy last september			2
however late , @entity123 jumped on the bandwagon with its own @entity2 clone mail - away service , but with the added advantage of allowing customers to return dvds to brick - and - mortar @entity123 stores			2
and finally , @entity123 is a blue - and - gold @entity100 rip , with kiosks placed in grocery stores and @entity138 's across the country			1
wired : the @entity141 acquisition could mean big things for @entity123 when ( or if ) the companies get a game plan up and running			0
tired : @entity145 and mortar is slowly dying , so the leg - up @entity123 has on @entity2 with in - store dvd exchange may soon be moot			2
ripping off its two major competitors shows a lack of ability to innovate , possibly signifying that the company is still behind the times			2
@entity154 at $ 8 a month , @entity154 offers instant streaming access to a wealth of tv shows only a day or so after they 've originally aired			1
but seriously , if you 're paying a monthly fee , you should n't have to deal with mid-show commercial breaks			0
that 's the whole point of paying for streaming service , right ? still , i challenge you to find a more comprehensive archive of @entity166 reruns on the web			2
wired : streaming to all @entity59 devices and some @entity61 smartphones and tablets			2
tons of tv shows that are n't out to rent on dvd			1
tired : despite taking your $ 8 monthly fee , you still have to sit through asinine commercials			1
" hundreds , " not thousands , of movies to choose from			0
again , no physical media			0
rights agreements sometimes complicate how many episodes are available for viewing on the site			0
android market @entity181 has struggled to keep up with @entity182 in its media service offerings , only recently debuting its movie rental service on the @entity180 in conjunction with a complete interface makeover			2
fortunately , renting flicks from @entity181 is available on all @entity61 devices running version 2.2 and up — that 's something even @entity154 ca n't say			1
wired : rental ai n't pricey , averaging around two to five bucks a pop. streaming to @entity61 phones is nice			2
compatible with @entity194 tired : no physical media			0
not functional across all @entity61 tablets			0
@entity197 and @entity198 there 's a down - payment to get @entity198 up and running in your home , and it 's in the form of a small , sleek set - top box			2
fortunately , it 's only $ 100			2
along with @entity2 compatibility , @entity182 lets you purchase and rent movies from its @entity197 media store , along with the ability to buy tv shows ( due to lack of customer demand , @entity182 discontinued tv show rentals last month )			1
further , you 're able to watch streaming media on all of @entity182 's mobile devices			2
the company wants to hook you into an @entity182 - centric world , and the interconnection between its services makes it easier for customers to buy in			2
wired : purchase prices are par for the course , ranging from $ 1 to $ 3 depending on whether you want to rent or own			2
ability to buy entire seasons of a show is convenient			0
rumors and speculation have long suggested bigger plans for @entity198 's future , though @entity182 itself is staying mum on any potential developments			0
tired : lacks an " all - you - can - stream buffet " option , which can get costly if you watch a lot of flicks			2
though its library is extensive , @entity197 alone does n't contain the esoteric indie films that @entity2 totes			0
so if you 're subscribing to @entity2 and buying through @entity197 at the same time , charges could add up fast			0
@entity245 @entity246 got in on the media - services game in 2010 by buying @entity245 , another streaming media company			1
initially the service was available only in a set - top box version , but @entity245 has since extended itself to other platforms as a standalone media service in and of itself , available to @entity254 users , @entity255 for @entity257 owners and @entity259 - based @entity194 users			0
wired : rentals and purchases stay on par with most other services , settling in the $ 1 to $ 5 range for rentals , and upwards of $ 5 for purchases			0
titles available the same day they 're released on dvd , unlike other services that require waiting periods			0
streaming video available on @entity272			0
tired : no monthly unlimited movie - streaming option .			1

@entity73 launched in 2005 , offering two - day shipping on any of its products
@entity100 made it possible for legions of supermarket shoppers to pick up a movie on the cheap
at $ 8 a month , @entity154 offers instant streaming access to a wealth of tv shows
