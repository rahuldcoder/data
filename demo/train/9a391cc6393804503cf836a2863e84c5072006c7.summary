@entity0 -- " there 's no doubt " that the deadly attack on @entity6 's financial capital last month was planned inside @entity7 , secretary of state @entity8 told @entity1 on sunday			1
people in @entity10 , @entity6 , take part in a candlelight vigil for the victims of the @entity15 attacks on sunday			1
her comments to @entity1 's " @entity18 " were the most definitive made by a top - ranking @entity20 official regarding @entity7 's connection to the november 26 - 29 attack on @entity15 , in which more than 170 were killed and hundreds of others were wounded			2
" well , i think there 's no doubt that @entity7 territory was used by probably non-state actors , " @entity25 said			1
" i do n't think that there is compelling evidence of involvement of @entity7 officials			0
but i do think that @entity7 has a responsibility to act , and it does n't matter that they 're non-state actors			1
" last week , @entity25 traveled to the region to try to ease tension between @entity6 and @entity7 , both nuclear powers and key allies of the @entity20			1
while in @entity10 , @entity6 , she called on @entity7 to take responsibility for terrorists operating within its borders			1
@entity7 president @entity45 has said " stateless actors " carried out the attack while @entity6 authorities say they believe all the attackers were @entity7 , specifically blaming @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , an @entity50 militant group based in @entity7			1
@entity20 counterterrorism officials say signs point to @entity49 , and they have n't seen anything to rule it out			0
however , they have not definitively said the group is responsible			0
@entity20 director of national intelligence @entity56 said during an appearance tuesday at @entity59 that the @entity15 attacks were carried out by the same group responsible for the parliament attack and a series of bomb explosions aboard trains and at railway stations in @entity15 in 2006 -- though he did n't specifically name @entity49			1
@entity49 has denied any responsibility for the attacks , but a suspect in custody -- whom @entity6 has said was one of 10 gunmen in the attacks -- told interrogators he was trained by @entity49 , @entity6 authorities said			2
@entity6 said its forces killed nine gunmen			0
on sunday , @entity25 said @entity49 and @entity78 " tend to travel in the same circles , " though she declined to directly link either group to the @entity15 attack			2
but she stressed that @entity7 is obligated to root out terrorists within its borders			1
" well , i do n't want to go into too much detail here because , obviously , in counterterrorism no one wants to tip the hand of what has happened here and what may happen in the future , " @entity25 said			0
" the important thing now is to get these perpetrators and to prevent follow - on attacks			0
and @entity7 's cooperation , @entity7 's action , is absolutely essential to doing that			0
" asked about possible ties between @entity7 's government and @entity49 , @entity25 acknowledged " there have been historic ties -- there 's no doubt about that			2
" " but @entity7 is a different place now with a civilian government and an army leadership that is working in concert to try to bring an end to extremism within @entity7 , " she said			0
" we have to remember that @entity7 itself has been suffering at the hands of extremism			0
so whatever the history here , and there is a history , the important thing is that @entity7 act against those who used @entity7 soil to perpetrate attacks			0

@entity25 : @entity7 is obligated to root out terrorists within its borders
