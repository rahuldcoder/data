@entity0 and the widow of the man he killed inside a movie theater both shed tears wednesday inside a @entity6 courtroom , as lawyers for both sides called witnesses to support their arguments on whether the 71 - year - old gunman should get bail			1
along with such raw emotion , the @entity14 hearing was flush with vivid details from witnesses about what happened early in the afternoon of january 13 inside a theater in the @entity21 suburb of @entity22			0
they recounted how , after @entity0 told management about @entity26 texting during previews , the men exchanged words			1
@entity26 then allegedly tossed his bag of popcorn at @entity0 , who fired a single , fatal gunshot moments later			1
he 's been jailed ever since , without bail , on a second - degree murder charge			2
wednesday 's testimony and the cross-examinations were so extensive that the day ended without a decision from judge @entity37			2
instead , the hearing will resume at 10 a.m. friday with testimony from more prosecution witnesses and the playing of surveillance video and audio			1
several people testified wednesday as character witnesses for @entity0			2
the most powerful of them was his daughter , @entity47			0
no threats before shooting , widow says in addition to discussing her father 's financial holdings -- including a house valued at $ 186,000 as well as $ 22,000 in bank accounts -- @entity57 spoke of how her father had always been involved and supportive			0
that includes helping with her 2 - year - old daughter and after she moved in with her parents after splitting from her husband			0
@entity57 said she did n't recall her father -- who became visibly emotional with his daughter on the stand -- getting angry with strangers , said his temperament has n't changed in recent years and insisted that he does n't pose a danger to the community			0
and after being asked whether she had any doubt her father would show up for court if he received bail , @entity57 answered unequivocally : " no doubt at all			2
" @entity57 said she 'd long " assumed " that her father , a @entity80 veteran and retired police officer with a concealed weapons permit , carried a gun with him at all times			0
but should he come to the family 's @entity87 home , there would be no guns around : @entity57 testified that all firearms and ammunition in that house were removed the day after the theater shooting			0
the prosecution then began presenting its own slate of witnesses , starting with 68 - year - old @entity97			0
he sat a few seats down from @entity26 that january day in the row in front of @entity0			1
during the previews , @entity97 said he heard @entity0 and @entity26 talking , and at one point , the latter said , " i 'm just texting my 2 - year - old daughter			1
" soon after that , a " very agitated " @entity105 left the theater then returned a few minutes later and again addressed @entity26			0
moviegoers recounted what happened next			0
widow : ' my whole world just got shattered ' @entity113 -- who spent 27 years in the @entity114 , including time as a clandestine officer who worked in @entity116 -- recalled a relatively calm @entity26 saying , " do you mind , i 've got a voice mail from my daughter 's babysitter ? do you mind i check to see if my daughter 's alright ? " the atmosphere changed considerably soon after that			1
while witnesses did not recount what @entity0 said , @entity97 said that , whatever it was , " i felt @entity26 had enough			1
" @entity128 , a corporal with the @entity130 sheriff 's office who was taking in a movie with his wife , said he heard @entity26 saying , at one point , " i am trying to text my f * * king daughter , if you do n't mind " -- using graphic language that @entity0 ' lawyer said suggested @entity26 was angry and threatening			1
the popcorn flew in @entity0 ' direction soon thereafter			1
" and almost immediately , " recalled @entity113 , who said @entity26 threw the bag , " the gun comes out and there are shots fired			1
" @entity26 then stumbled and said , " i ca n't believe he shot me , " before falling on @entity97 ' son , the witness recalled			1
a nurse who also happened to be in theater then testified -- as @entity26 's widow , @entity150 , wiped away tears -- about unsuccessful efforts to save his life			1
according to @entity113 , @entity0 said , " throw popcorn in my face			2
" couple describes encounter with @entity105 @entity128 said that right after the shooting , he acted quickly to take the gun from @entity0 -- who was sitting , as he 'd been during the shooting -- and subdue him			0
before more authorities arrived , @entity0 ' wife told her husband " that was no cause to shoot anyone , " according to @entity128 , the law enforcement officer who was then off - duty			2
@entity0 responded by pointing his finger at her and saying , according to @entity128 , " you shut your f * * king mouth and do n't say another word			0
" the off - duty corporal said that at one point , @entity0 pushed back his glasses and said out loud , " holy f * * k , what have i done ? " defense attorney @entity176 challenged each of these prosecution witnesses			0
for some , he said their recollections may be cloudy due to witnesses ' vantage points , eyesight or the theater 's dim lighting			0
@entity176 also sought to portray the larger , younger @entity26 as imposing compared to @entity0			1
his client , @entity0 , remains behind bars pending the outcome of this hearing .			2

witness : @entity26 asked to text his daughter 's babysitter , then got upset
@entity0 fired 1 shot after popcorn flew , then cursed at his wife , witness says
witness : as he was being subdued , @entity0 said , " what have i done ? "
the bail hearing will resume friday *morning* , according to the judge
