@entity0 -- as the @entity3 and the @entity4 debated and passed budgets recently , one person was notably absent from the debate : president @entity7			1
for the fourth time in five years , the president is late submitting his budget to @entity10			1
so late , in fact , this year both the @entity3 and @entity4 were forced to move forward without him , rendering the president 's budget request completely irrelevant			1
unfortunately , the president 's tardiness is reflective of his fundamental lack of seriousness when it comes to budgeting			0
families and businesses have to ensure that their spending , including their debt payments , does n't exceed their income , but the president acts as if he does n't think that should apply to the federal government			1
recently , when speaking about his budget ( which the @entity3 says will be out next week , a full two months after the deadline ) , the president said that he did n't want " to chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance			1
" well , perhaps he should chase a balanced budget for the sake of our economy			0
for four years now , the president 's agenda has been out - of - control spending , massive tax hikes on @entity42 and burdensome regulations on job creators			2
since the president took office , we 've seen more than $ 1.7 trillion in new tax hikes , $ 518 billion in new regulations , and $ 6 trillion added to the national debt			1
the impact of those policies has not been pretty			0
economic growth under this president has averaged just 0.8 %			2
that is n't anywhere close to the 5 % growth needed for a real recovery			2
while it 's certainly true that the president inherited a bad economy , it 's important to note that he inherited it more than four years ago			0
what has he been doing since ? let 's put this in perspective			0
@entity66 inherited a bad economy			2
but @entity66 put in place growth - oriented economic policies such as fundamental tax reform and fewer regulations , which turned the economy around			1
during the @entity66 recovery , the economy grew nearly three times as fast as it has under @entity7 's watch			1
during the fourth year of @entity66 's presidency , the economy experienced robust 7.2 % growth			2
in contrast , the fourth year of @entity7 's presidency produced economic growth of just 2.2 %			1
if the @entity7 recovery were as strong as @entity66 's , our economy would be $ 1.5 trillion larger today -- meaning more jobs , more opportunity , and more take - home pay for @entity42			1
the fact is @entity7 's spending , tax and regulatory policies are smothering economic recovery , jobs and opportunity			1
just take the president 's $ 2.6 trillion health care overhaul signed into law three years ago			0
the @entity100 recently issued a report stating employers in several regions are laying off workers and cutting back on new hires as a direct result of the president 's health care law			0
four years into the president 's term , 12 million @entity42 are still out of work and the labor force participation rate has declined to 63.5 %			0
@entity42 are becoming so discouraged in the @entity7 economy that they simply stop looking for work			2
if the labor force participation rate today were the same as when the president took office , the real unemployment rate would be 10.7 %			0
yet despite the abysmal failures of the president 's policies , he continues to argue for more of the same			0
it 's time to try something new : time to balance the budget , rein in @entity0 's dangerous levels of spending and unleash economic growth by expanding energy production being held back by the @entity7 administration , such as the @entity131			1
it 's time to cut excessive government red tape strangling our small businesses and to truly reform our tax code to make rates lower and fairer for all @entity42			0
we should be taking an honest look at the relationship between the president 's policies and economic growth			2
the president 's tax hikes , runaway spending and onslaught of new and burdensome regulations are preventing a real economic recovery			1
it 's time for the president to get out of the way of the @entity42 people and let our economy take off			0
it 's time to do better than 0.8 % growth			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			0

sen. @entity159 : president @entity7 is late submitting budget to @entity10
he says @entity3 is n't serious about government living by a budget
he says **higher** taxes , more regulations , **higher** debt are hurting economic recovery
@entity159 : recovery from *recession* under @entity7 is much *slower* than under @entity66
