-- as a trained chef , restaurant owner , healthy - cookbook author , and confirmed food lover , i absolutely refuse to let the word diet hijack my life -- and i do n't think you should , either			1
smart eating is not about settling for less ; it 's about heaping more good stuff on your plate			1
three - grain pilaf is a both mouth - watering dish and a contains a dose of healthy carbs			1
let 's change just one health habit a week -- shopping , cooking , and eating to meet that goal -- for four weeks ? after a month of making basic grains , fruit , and vegetables into staples using my recipes , you 'll find it much easier to plan delicious , satisfying meals			1
try @entity32 's four - week approach to transforming your eating habits ! week one : make a produce - aisle hit list eating more fruits and vegetables is one of the most important dietary habits you can adopt to prevent heart disease , cancer , diabetes , and hypertension and to manage your weight			1
vegetables in particular will cost you little in the way of calories while offering huge health benefits			1
your weekly goal is to eat five to nine servings of fruits and veggies a day			2
that 's not as challenging as it may seem			0
the serving sizes are reasonable one medium - size fruit , a half cup of cooked vegetables , three - quarters of a cup of 100 - percent juice , one cup of raw leafy vegetables , a quarter cup of dried fruit			1
mix fruit into your breakfast cereal , add lettuce and tomato to your sandwich ( with a side of a vegetable - based soup ) , eat a piece of fruit in the afternoon and a vegetable side at dinner , and you 've taken care of at least five servings			1
before shopping , write down the names of five richly colored vegetables and fruits that you really like , then add to the list two that you 're curious about and are willing to try			1
week two : defy your white flour urge until recently , it seemed that only nutritionists ( and cereal box labels ) used the words whole grain			0
now delicious whole grain soups , desserts , and breads -- bursting with color , texture and flavor -- have become popular			0
it 's also widely known that they have the power to deliver key antioxidants			0
your weekly goal is to make sure that half of your grain servings per day ( three to five one - ounce servings ) are whole grains such as wild rice , brown rice , barley , bulgur , corn ( polenta ) , faro , quinoa , wheat berries , or whole wheat couscous			2
whole grain foods are not refined , which means they contain all three parts of the grain , including the two lost in the refining process -- the outer layer , bran , which provides fiber , b vitamins , and antioxidants ; and the germ , the nutrient - packed inner portion , containing protein , vitamins , minerals , and antioxidants			2
the endosperm , the starchy part of the grain left in refined products such as white flour , contains some protein and lots of carbs but few nutrients			0
look for the word whole on the ingredient list , followed by the name of the grain			0
research shows that adding even a moderate amount of whole grain to your diet every day -- whole grain cereal topped with fruit for breakfast , toasty multigrain bread at lunch , and a pilaf or grain salad for dinner -- significantly reduces the risk of heart disease , type 2 diabetes , and digestive system and hormone - related cancers			1
week three : get the perks of dairy -- without all the fat this week , add some reduced - fat dairy , which will cream up your cooking and get healthy calcium into your diet ( approximately 75 percent of adult @entity171 do n't get the recommended daily allowance )			1
studies show not only that calcium helps prevent osteoporosis but that getting enough calcium each day ( 1,000 milligrams from ages 19 to 50 and 1,200 milligrams after age 50 ) , along with adequate vitamin d ( 200 @entity180 ; 400 @entity180 after age 50 ) , helps control weight , lowers blood pressure , and may prevent certain types of cancer			0
your goal is to eat three to four servings a day of low - fat cheeses , yogurt , and 1 percent or skim milk ; the calcium in dairy products is the most readily absorbed by your body			1
if you 're lactose intolerant , fortified soy products -- particularly those with calcium malate -- are a fine substitute in cooking and often contain similar amounts of protein , vitamin d , and calcium			0
i do not recommend fat - free dairy products , particularly cheese ; instead of getting creamy , bubbly , and brown in recipes , it can turn rubbery and tasteless			1
week four : get protein in the past three weeks , you have learned how vegetables , fruit , whole grains , and low - fat dairy can help you fill your plate with quality nutrients that do n't pack a lot of calories			1
now it 's time to address protein			0
getting enough is not something most of us need to worry about , but selecting well is			0
your goal is to eat five to six ounces of lean and healthy protein a day			2
eat it all in one meal ( most restaurant servings of protein are at least five ounces ) , or eat smaller portions throughout the day			0
i often tell clients to divide their plate into quarters : three quarters should be filled with whole grains and vegetables ; one quarter should be a serving of protein -- such as shrimp , fish , chicken , beans , tofu , lean cuts of beef , or pork -- about the size of a deck of cards			2
poultry and meat can take little time to cook ( grilling and searing in a hot , nonstick pan ) or a lot of hands - off time ( braising and stewing until they are fork - tender and flavorful )			2
some high - protein foods are rich in protective nutrients , such as the omega - 3 fatty acids found in walnuts and fish like wild salmon			2
use nuts as a garnish to add flavor , texture , and toastiness to salad , or eat a small handful as a snack			0
beans are a near - perfect food -- high in protein , fiber , b vitamins , iron , calcium , and magnesium , and very low in fat			1
puree them into dips and spreads , or add them to salads , soups , stews , and casseroles for extra protein oomph			0
