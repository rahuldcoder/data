@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 accused @entity5 drones and special forces of involvement in the death of @entity10 leader @entity9 in comments thursday			1
he also attacked @entity5 sen. @entity12 over a warning that @entity3 might follow the same path as @entity10 , suggesting @entity12 was not of sound mind following his time as a prisoner during the @entity18			1
@entity2 's comments were prompted by a question during his traditional year - end question - and - answer program , broadcast live by state media			0
responding to a question about @entity12 purportedly predicting @entity2 would meet the same fate as @entity10 's leader , the @entity3 prime minister described the televised images of @entity9 's final moments as " horrible , disgusting scenes " and pointed to @entity5 involvement in his death			1
" is that democracy ? who did this ? drones , including those of the @entity5 , struck his motorcade and then commandos , who were not supposed to be there , called for the so - called opposition and militants by the radio , and he was killed without an investigation or trial , " @entity2 said			2
@entity5 defense secretary @entity45 acknowledged the day after @entity9 's death that " it was a @entity5 drone combined with the other @entity49 planes that fired on the convoy " in which the @entity10 leader was traveling outside the city of @entity53			1
but the @entity54 has denied that any @entity5 forces were on the ground in a combat role in @entity10			0
when asked about @entity12 , @entity2 said he had met the senator from @entity59 , but said the questioner 's description of him as the prime minister 's friend was " exaggerated			1
" he then questioned the mental state of @entity12 , who ran for @entity5 president in 2008 , saying he " was taken prisoner in @entity67 , and was held not just in jail , but was put in a pit where he was kept for several years -- any person under those circumstances would hardly remain mentally sane			0
" shortly afterward , @entity12 himself jumped into the row via @entity75 , posting : " @entity76 , is it something i said ? " and linking to a news story headlining the @entity3 prime minister calling @entity12 " nuts			1
" the senator 's earlier @entity75 posts had linked to news stories suggesting @entity3 might be in line for its own version of the " @entity85 " but did not appear to suggest @entity2 would meet the same fate as @entity9			2
@entity2 's attack may be a response to critical comments made by @entity12 in the @entity90 last week			2
@entity12 said his statement was a response to " the flawed @entity94 election that just occurred this weekend , and in light of my strong belief that the growing demand for dignity and uncorrupt governance that has defined the @entity101 world this year may impact @entity3 as well			2
" @entity12 highlighted " the unfortunate issue of @entity3 's continued back - sliding on human rights and democracy " and said the post-election protests were unsurprising given " the pattern of corruption and abuse that the @entity3 government has perpetrated over many years			1
" he also criticized @entity3 's " absolutely shameless " blocking of @entity111 action on president @entity112 in @entity113 , despite widespread concerns over human rights abuses there			1
" the demand for dignity , and justice , and democracy that is shaking the @entity101 world to its foundations will not be confined to that one region alone , " he said , but will spread and demonstrate that change is possible			0
" and it appears that message may be resonating with people in @entity3 , " he added			0
in his televised remarks , @entity2 suggested that criticism of @entity3 was linked to its pursuit of " an independent foreign policy			0
" while his country had more friends than enemies in @entity136 , he said , " some would like to sideline @entity3 so that it does n't get in the way of those wanting to dominate the globe			0
" @entity2 's latest comments come a week after he blamed the @entity5 for encouraging opposition protests in the wake of @entity3 's parliamentary elections			1
he said @entity5 secretary of state @entity141 had criticized the elections as " neither fair not free -- even before receiving reports from international observers			0
" this had sent a signal to opposition figures , @entity2 said , who " with the support of the @entity150 " then began " active work			0
" @entity152 responded to those remarks by restating her country 's " strong commitment to democracy and human rights			2
" @entity1 's @entity159 in @entity0 and @entity160 in @entity161 contributed to this report .			0
