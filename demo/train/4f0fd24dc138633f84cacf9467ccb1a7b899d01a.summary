-- in the beginning was a word , sketched on a legal pad			1
and the word was status			2
that was the working title used by programmer @entity6 in 2000 , when he designed the service that was to become @entity8 six years later			1
an urban - design geek , @entity6 envisaged a city full of people buzzing short messages at each other the way taxi dispatchers and bike messengers do			0
where are you ? what 's up ? what 's your status ? today , five years after its inception , @entity8 's status seems in flux			1
on the one hand , it is a vibrant virtual metropolis beyond @entity6 's wildest imaginings			2
it has garnered 200 million citizens from every corner of the world , yet manages to be more orderly and simple than that noisy @entity33 megalopolis down the road			0
there are no annoying @entity43 notifications here , no targeted ads , no anxiety - producing friend requests -- nothing but real - time messages from whomever you 're interested in , be they @entity44 or the girl next door			2
on the other hand , all is not well in @entity49			0
this week 's cover story in @entity51 warns that @entity8 usage appears to be flatlining			1
one hundred million of those citizens are absent altogether , and @entity8 has fewer visitors per month -- about 20 million -- than @entity55 , according to @entity56			1
the company has a steady hand on the tiller in new ceo @entity60 but lacks a visionary product leader ( @entity6 is equally focused on his next company , @entity63 )			0
it still suffers from irritating outages and is n't turning a profit			0
and as @entity0 reported on wednesday , @entity67 , the company behind mobile twitter apps like @entity70 , is planning to build a rival microblogging network , one that may shun the famous 140 - character limit			0
so are the buzzards circling over @entity49 ? should tweeters head for the hills or prepare to move to a competing town with fewer regulations ? in a word : no. the city that @entity6 built is a lot more robust -- and unrepeatable -- than it may seem			2
first of all , let 's look at those numbers			2
they vary wildly according to which service you use and how you slice them			2
@entity88 says there has been a 50 % jump in @entity8 usage in the past five months			1
most of that is overseas : @entity94 says international traffic has risen 83 % in the past year			1
and because so many people are tweeting on their mobile device or third party app , the @entity8 numbers are incomplete and misleading			1
but even if we take the extremely conservative estimate of 20 million hardcore @entity8 users , that ai n't chopped liver			1
it 's a phenomenal achievement for a 5 - year - old company			2
these devotees could fill @entity109 and @entity110 combined			0
they ensure a neverending stream of news of every kind , perfectly customizable to your needs			0
you may be overwhelmed in @entity49 , but you will never be bored			0
no other service , not even @entity33 , gives the impression of immersing you in a global conversation , a fact that becomes abundantly clear any time there is a natural disaster , revolution or major sporting event			1
as @entity60 frequently says , the service has barely reached 1 % of its potential			1
a hardcore elite of 20 million - plus also represents an unassailable lead over would - be competitors like @entity67			0
many have tried , such as @entity130 ( bought and then abandoned by @entity131 ) and the now - defunct @entity132			0
but this is n't a medium like tv , where many channels can succeed			0
this is more like a network where @entity8 itself contains all the channels			1
barring @entity8 doing something phenomenally stupid , like charging users for the service , why would you change the dial ? indeed , the only successful fellow microblogging services thus far are the ones that build layers on top of @entity8 , such as @entity149 , or open - source additions like @entity151			1
be they gated communities or anarchic communes at the edge of @entity49 , they all need the vibrant metropolis itself in order to thrive			0
and what of that 140 - character limit ? far from being a problem , it remains @entity8 's greatest asset , as much as a tiny minority of users may chafe against it			1
in urban terms , it is the stop - light system that keeps traffic flowing -- and allows everyone to get a word in edgewise			2
screenwriters and poets have long known that if something is worth saying , it 's worth saying as briefly as possible			0
with @entity8 , the rest of the world is finding that out			1
call it the democratization of writing			0
anyone can enter the elite of @entity49 and gain thousands of followers , if they have the wit for it			0
in short , the ability to churn out interesting tweets has become a much - admired skill -- the ultimate 21st - century status symbol .			1

five years after its inception , @entity8 's status seems in flux -- but it 's actually doing just fine
@entity88 : there has been a 50 % jump in @entity8 usage in the past five months
no other service gives the impression of immersing you in a global conversation
