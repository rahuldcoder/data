@entity0 , @entity1 -- the helicopter is on the chase			1
at first , you can only hear it			0
then , from behind the hillside , you see a herd of wild horses running for their freedom , with the helicopter close behind			1
one escapes the trap , barely			0
this is the scene at the @entity19 wild horse roundup in @entity0 , @entity1			1
the helicopter pilot works for the federal government			1
the crowd is composed mainly of activists opposed to the roundups			2
more and more , the roundups are becoming showdowns between protesters and the @entity28			2
" they are by law supposed to protect these horses , and in fact they are doing the exact opposite -- they are exterminating them , " says @entity29 , founder of the advocacy group @entity30			2
" they are managing them to extinction			0
" @entity28 says this charge is not true , insisting there are more wild horses and burros today than there were in 1971 , when it started the roundup program			1
that year , fearing that the wild horses and small donkeys roaming the open ranges of the western @entity53 were disappearing , @entity49 decided to try to save them			1
a rare unanimous vote in 1971 directed the secretary of the interior to protect and manage these horses and burros , as much a part of the @entity59 as the cowboy			1
but as the number of animals began to grow , the program began to shift to population control			1
and that has triggered an outcry from wild - horse advocates , which really began to resonate in 2010			2
members of @entity49 and other wildlife organizations paid closer attention to the issue last year , because the bureau removed more horses and burros in 2010 than in nearly any other year			1
the bureau says there are about 33,700 wild horses and 4,700 burros roaming on @entity28 ranges in 10 western states			1
if they were left on their own , the population would explode , according to the bureau			2
the government 's plan is to reduce the number of animals by 12,000			2
that would leave about 26,600 horses and burros on the 26 million acres set aside for these animals to live , according to the @entity28			1
much of the public land on which the bureau manages the wild mustangs is also home to other wildlife and livestock			2
some of the land is used for recreational and mining interests			0
" we have to manage for all users , " says @entity101 , the head of @entity28 's @entity1 office			0
" we ca n't let one , say the horse , impact everybody else by taking all the feed , all the water			0
" after they are rounded up , some of the wild horses are trained by prisoners at nearby correctional facilities			1
once the horses are broken , the prison can auction them off for about $ 1,500 per animal			2
read more about the prisoner program the problem is n't the horses , says @entity119 , but the cattle that are allowed to graze on the same land			1
the @entity28 is charged with deciding how many wild horses should reside on each herd management area			1
at the @entity19 roundup , authorities decided that the 11,000 acres could support between seven and 10 horses			1
there were 117 horses on the property , so the @entity28 rounded up all the mustangs and then selected seven to release back into the wild			1
but how do they determine the ratio of horses to land ? activists insist that number of horses the government finds appropriate for the land -- which is based on water and food -- is not scientific			1
the study determining the number of horses that will remain in the @entity19 management area was done in the mid- 1990s			2
in addition , there is no water on the @entity19 land			0
the horses drink from water sources on adjacent state park land			2
when asked how @entity19 ever became a herd management area to begin with , @entity101 did not know			0
in @entity1 , there are just seven people handling 85 herd management areas covering millions of acres			0
" so , we are pretty thin , " admits @entity101			0
" it takes a lot of work to collect that data , a lot of time and effort , so we 're not as effective as we possibly could be			0
we hope to be better			0
" what is effective , according to @entity101 , is the use of helicopters in rounding up the horses and burros			1
" we can do our management in a quicker , shorter period of time that reduces that level of impact , " he says			0
the helicopters may reduce the time to round up the mustangs , but it gives activists another argument			2
" to be rounded up in the way that it is done with helicopters , being run for miles and miles and miles -- it 's brutal , " says @entity119			2
" it 's barbaric and it does not need to be done this way			0
" her group has proposed a method where a water source would be fenced off and once the horses enter , the gate would be closed behind them			2
many activists opposed to the use of helicopters point to a roundup earlier this year known as " @entity199 , " in which more than 100 horses died			1
activists attribute the deaths to the running of the horses in the cold over hard ground			2
the @entity28 insists most of the deaths were mares that could not adapt to the hay they were fed after they were captured			0
the roundups are open to the public and those attending are usually members of a wild horse advocacy group			1
armed with cameras , they try to document what they call " inhumane " treatment of the wild horses			1
there is no disputing the incidents that are caught on tape when a helicopter skid bumps a horse or knocks a burro off its feet			0
" this is not a risk - free operation and yes , horses do get killed , " says @entity228 , spokesman for @entity28			0
but , he adds , " we have a very low mortality rate of less than 1 % from gather - related deaths			1
" @entity228 says the activists would oppose the roundups even if there were n't any injuries , because they just want the management of the horses to stop			1
ever since the problems during the @entity244 , the fight between the two groups has intensified			0
when pressed about horses being injured by helicopter skids , @entity228 goes on the defensive			1
" it sounds like you bought into their point of view , " he says			0
an objective view was hard to obtain during the @entity19 roundup , since the media were kept about a quarter of a mile away from where the horses were being corralled			1
@entity101 says the safety of the horses and the men rounding them up is his first priority			0
the reason we were kept so far away , says @entity101 , is because if we were any closer , our cameras might spook the horses			0
" they do not want the issue on camera			0
period , " says @entity268 , the founder of @entity269 , pointing out how the horses are already spooked by the helicopter			1
the question of access is currently an issue in a court case bought by a wild - horse advocate			0
many of the activists ' issues pertaining to the roundups have been brought into the courts , most unsuccessfully			0
they also hold protests , some as far away as @entity284			0
there have also been calls for president @entity287 to impose a moratorium on the roundup			0
the only real progress thus far for the activists came from a group of members of @entity49 , who encouraged the bureau to ask for an independent study of its @entity297 and @entity296			0
it will take the @entity299 two years to complete its assessment			0
in the meantime , the wild mustangs of the @entity59 will continue to be rounded up			1
the activists say they will continue to be on hand , cheering for the ones that get away -- even if , like the one who dodged the trap at @entity19 , their freedom lasts only a few more minutes			0
