@entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 leaders unveiled a 2013 budget blueprint tuesday that has little chance of becoming law but draws a clear contrast with democrats on taxes , spending , and a host of hot - button political issues -- all of which could play a pivotal role in the 2012 campaign			1
republicans cast the $ 3.53 trillion plan -- which doubles down on past @entity3 proposals to overhaul @entity22 and other politically sensitive programs -- as a bold attempt to reverse skyrocketing federal deficits and avert a looming fiscal catastrophe			1
" this plan of action is about putting an end to empty promises from bankrupt government and restoring the fundamental promise of @entity36 , ensuring that our children have more opportunity than we do , " said @entity28 chairman @entity27 , @entity29			2
" we 're here to offer @entity36 the chance to choose which future they want for themselves : the president 's path of debt and decline , or the path that we 're proposing , a path to renew prosperity for @entity36			0
" democrats called it a betrayal of last year 's bipartisan deficit reduction deal , and characterized it as another @entity3 giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and vulnerable seniors			1
sensing electoral opportunity , they also tried to hang it around @entity3 presidential frontrunner @entity62 's political neck			1
" if you 're @entity62 , you 're going to love this budget , because what it does is provide another round of tax cuts for the wealthiest @entity36 and does it at the expense of middle - class taxpayers and seniors , " @entity64 rep. @entity63 , a member of the @entity4 @entity66 leadership , told @entity1			1
@entity4 communications director @entity77 said in a written statement that the proposed @entity3 budget " fails the test of balance , fairness , and shared responsibility			1
" it " draws on the same wrong - headed theory that led to the worst recession of our lifetimes and contributed to the erosion of middle - class security over the last decade , " he argued			2
@entity4 bashes budget proposal among other things , the @entity4 @entity3 plan calls for a reduction in individual tax rates and brackets			1
instead of today 's six brackets , with rates from 10 % to 35 % , it calls for just two -- 10 % and 25 %			0
the proposal would eliminate the @entity101 , while dropping the top corporate tax rate from 35 % to 25 %			0
@entity3 leaders would compensate for lost revenue by closing a series of tax loopholes and ending numerous deductions			2
they declined to offer details tuesday , however , on exactly which loopholes and deductions would be affected , noting that the matter would be taken up at the congressional committee level in the near future			0
returning to one of the most controversial points from last year 's budget fight , the proposal includes dramatic changes to the @entity22 program			1
it would offer future seniors a choice of staying in the traditional fee - for - service plan or opting instead for a @entity22 - approved private plan , all of which would be available via a new @entity22 exchange			2
no matter which plan they chose , including the traditional @entity22 plan , seniors would receive a government subsidy to help pay for their choice			2
" we propose to save and strengthen @entity22 by taking power away from the government bureaucrats , " @entity27 said			2
" we preserve the @entity22 guarantee for today 's seniors so they can count on the benefit that they 've organized their retirement around , and we preserve that guarantee going into the future for tomorrow 's seniors by empowering them with choices			2
" the @entity151 " have made it clear they want @entity22 to wither on the vine , to die , and this is an important step for them in that direction , " said @entity4 minority leader @entity143 , @entity144			1
" bless their hearts , they do n't believe in @entity22 , and they act upon their beliefs			2
" @entity155 , which provides health coverage for the poor , would be converted under the @entity3 plan into a series of block grants for the states			2
individual states would be empowered to tighten eligibility rules or revise enrollees ' cost - sharing obligations			0
budget proposal would overhaul @entity155 the @entity3 proposal also protects defense spending by undoing a scheduled $ 55 billion cut in the @entity170 budget , replacing the reduction with cuts elsewhere			1
@entity27 has called the scheduled @entity170 cuts -- part of the agreement reached in last summer 's @entity176 -- " devastating to @entity36 's defense capabilities			0
" among the compensating changes : greater federal worker pension contributions and more means - testing of entitlement benefits			0
overall , the @entity3 plan caps 2013 domestic discretionary spending -- programs other than defense and entitlements such as @entity185 and @entity22 -- at $ 1.028 trillion			1
@entity66 immediately cried foul when the new proposed cap was unveiled , noting that it 's nearly $ 20 billion below the total agreed to in last summer 's deficit reduction deal			1
the @entity151 " shook on ( that deal ) and they passed it as law , " @entity190 chairman @entity189 , @entity191 , said tuesday			0
" now they are threatening to ... walk away			0
" if @entity4 @entity3 fail to stick with the agreement , he warned , " they will once again threaten to shut down the government and needlessly imperil the economic recovery			1
" @entity4 @entity3 leaders insist they can propose any amount under the $ 1.047 trillion level , because that figure simply represents the top limit for discretionary spending , not a level up to which @entity209 must spend			1
" people have limits on credit cards			0
that does n't mean that you 're required to spend up to the limit , " argued house speaker @entity214 , @entity215			0
" we all know that we 've got a real fiscal problem here in @entity0 , and frankly we think we can do better			0
" while the @entity151 ' proposed budget has no chance of becoming law , it does promise to have a major impact on both the presidential and congressional campaigns			0
@entity66 believe the proposed @entity22 changes in particular could prove devastating to @entity3 hopes in key swing states such as @entity230 , which has a large elderly population			1
a number of @entity3 , however , believe they 'll ultimately be rewarded for having the political courage to tackle politically sensitive issues			2
conservatives also argue it 's critical to draw clear distinctions between top @entity3 and @entity66 before voters go to the polls in november			1
" if we simply operate based on political fear , nothing is ever going to get done , " @entity27 told reporters tuesday			0
" if we allow entitlement politics -- fear that your adversaries will turn your reforms into a political weapon to use against you -- and we cower to that , then @entity36 is going to have a debt crisis			0
" @entity27 insisted that the eventual @entity3 nominee will firmly support the @entity4 @entity3 's blueprint			1
" all of our candidates have campaigned on these various ideas , " he told reporters			0
" we are sharpening the contrast between the path that we 're proposing and ( @entity259 's ) path to debt and decline			0
" " and yes , we do believe our nominee ... is going to be perfectly consistent with this , " he stressed			0
" i 've spoken with all of these guys , and they believe we are heading in the right direction			0
" shortly after @entity27 's remarks , @entity62 released a statement praising the @entity4 @entity3 leadership for " taking a bold step toward putting our nation back on the track to fiscal sanity and robust economic growth			1
" " chairman @entity27 and i share the same goals of cutting taxes and fundamentally reforming our tax code , dramatically reducing federal spending , as well as finally tackling the crushing debt our nation faces , " @entity62 said			1
@entity1 's @entity281 , @entity282 , and @entity283 contributed to this report .			0
