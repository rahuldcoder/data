-- an autopsy report has revealed that @entity2 was shot six times			2
it 's among the few bits of concrete information released to the public , another being the name of the officer , @entity10 , who shot dead an unarmed and ( by some accounts ) surrendering @entity2 on august 9 on the street in @entity13 , @entity14			2
police have argued that their silence has been to protect @entity10 from retaliatory acts of violence			0
after all , as possible 2016 presidential candidate @entity19 argued on @entity22 's @entity21 show , " police are individuals , too			0
" they do , but @entity2 died without due process and is lifeless in a @entity13 morgue			0
even if @entity2 were guilty of stealing @entity29 cigars a short time before his encounter with @entity10 , as some have alleged , there is no death penalty in the @entity34 for such an offense			1
but a young black man is dead			0
we do n't know all the details of what happened on that street in @entity13			0
but for black men in @entity34 , the incident carries familiar , troubling echoes			1
black men occupy and distress the psyches of many white @entity34 , the way @entity48 in @entity49 's " @entity51 " unsettled the white folks of @entity51 , @entity52			1
justice , for black men , often seems whatever officers deem it to be			2
we remain , as the writer and activist @entity57 put it , " the pervasive irritant , the chronic allergy , the vague apprehension which ( makes ) one uncomfortable and jumpy			0
" even as we serve as the cornerstone of @entity34 " cool , " we continue to be seen by many as aberrant , inferior , threatening , hyper - sexed , and @entity65 - violent guests in this experiment in democracy -- still only " in " @entity34 and not " of " @entity34 , as the great @entity68 wrote more than a century ago regardless of what he may or may not have done , @entity2 's very presence on that @entity13 street would be seen by too many white men as threatening			1
in what has become a customary occurrence in @entity34 , @entity2 's fate was sealed by being and breathing as a nonwhite man at the wrong place and at the wrong time			1
according to a recent @entity81 report , white police officers in @entity34 killed a black person , 18 % of whom were under 21 , nearly twice a week between 2005 and 2012 -- more than twice the rate of such killings of white youth of the same age			1
the criminalization , incarceration and slaying of black people , in this so - called post-racial @entity34 , remain endemic			2
magazine : the aftermath in @entity13 unfortunately , many law enforcement professionals and police departments , but not all of them , seem to care more about safeguarding themselves and their authority than understanding this dynamic and protecting and serving accordingly			0
it comes as no surprise then that @entity13 police want to paint a different picture of the circumstances surrounding @entity2 's death			1
but as one protester 's sign put it , " @entity13 police need better scriptwriters			0
" their release of @entity10 's name friday was viewed by many not as an act of transparency , but of placation -- and instigation : while naming @entity10 , police conveniently released surveillance footage of a man , alleged to be @entity2 , involved in a strong - armed robbery at a local minimart			1
the indirect message here was that @entity10 could not be another cop with a jaundiced view of black males and an itchy trigger finger ; he was a dutiful white male compelled to use deadly force in the face of a menace			0
this new narrative is one we 've seen over and over through history old and recent : a black man , like @entity2 , is depicted in the foulest of ways to paper over institutional missteps and white male anxieties , and to grant absolution for the imperfections of both			2
as historian and writer @entity141 wrote in @entity143 , " the parameters of this story have already spread far beyond what happened between @entity2 and @entity10 that afternoon			0
" is this what concerns the police in @entity13 and beyond ; that there are many who would tether this tragedy to broader issues of socioeconomic isolation , criminalization of people of color and others on the margins ? that @entity2 's shooting would expose again the entrenched , systematic authoritarianism in a society that is more diverse than it ever has been , but still vulnerable to stereotypes and intolerance ? the delicate peace that had been achieved in @entity13 on thursday and friday has been erased by looting , a declaration of a state of emergency and curfew by @entity14 gov. @entity167			1
one hopes that more unrest will not follow as more details of @entity2 's death emerge			1
" what happens to a dream deferred ? " asked the great @entity172			1
" does it dry up like a raisin in the sun ? or fester like a sore -- and then run ? does it stink like rotten meat ? or crust and sugar over -- like a syrupy sweet ? maybe it just sags like a heavy load			0
or does it explode ? "			0

@entity186 : @entity2 's death by police carries troubling echoes for black men
black men in @entity34 *unjustly* seen as violent and threatening , @entity186 says
he says police 's release of robbery video meant to justify anxieties of white males
he cites @entity172 poem : " what happens to a dream deferred ? *...* does it explode ? "
