@entity0 -- new documents obtained by the @entity3 show " unjustified homicide " of detainees and concerns about the condition of confinement in @entity10 - run prisons in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , according to the @entity3			1
thousands of documents detailing the deaths of 190 @entity10 detainees were released by the @entity3 on friday			1
the @entity10 military gave the @entity3 the documents earlier in the week as a result of a @entity21 ( @entity21 ) lawsuit filed by the rights group			1
among the documents are autopsy reports and military investigations , including 25 to 30 cases the @entity3 says it believes are " unjustified homicide			1
" some of the homicides in the documents are widely known and have been reported in the media , such as the case of four @entity11 detainees executed by a group of @entity10 soldiers and then pushed into a @entity36 canal in 2007			1
others are thought by the @entity3 to be new			2
in one such case , a detainee was killed by an unnamed sergeant who walked into a room where the detainee was lying wounded " and assaulted him ... then shot him twice thus killing him , " one of the investigating documents says			0
the sergeant than instructed the other soldiers present to lie about the incident			0
later , the document says an unnamed corporal then shot the deceased detainee in the head after finding his corpse			0
in another example , documents note a soldier " committed the offense of murder when he shot and killed an unarmed @entity12 male			0
" but , according to the @entity3 , the individual was found not guilty of murder by general court - martial			0
" so far , the documents released by the government raise more questions than they answer , but they do confirm one troubling fact : that no senior officials have been held to account for the widespread abuse of detainees			1
without real accountability for these abuses , we risk inviting more abuse in the future , " the @entity3 said in a statement			0
the @entity76 disputes the allegations , saying it takes detainee treatment seriously			1
" @entity76 policy requires the immediate reporting of detainee deaths to appropriate @entity76 criminal investigative agencies regardless of the circumstances at the time of death , " said @entity76 spokeswoman , lt. col. @entity80			1
" indeed , the fact that so many autopsies and investigative reports exist indicates the seriousness with which the @entity76 takes its responsibilities regarding detainee treatment and accountability			1
" of the investigations in the documents , 43 had @entity10 soldiers or personnel as potential suspects , according to lt. col. @entity99 , an @entity100 spokesman			2
probable cause for murder was found in 13 of those investigations , resulting in 19 separate convictions , @entity99 said , many of which carried significant sentences , with some soldiers receiving 20 years or more			0
" it 's important to remember that the majority of these detainee deaths were due to reasons not directly involving @entity10 personnel			2
for example , a number were the result of detainee - on - detainee violence , " @entity99 said			0
" although there have been cases of individuals involved in misconduct , there is no evidence of systematic abuse by the @entity10 military , " said @entity80			1
" @entity125 has detained more than 100,000 individuals in @entity11 and @entity12 , many with pre-existing medical conditions or battlefield wounds			0
detainees in @entity76 custody have died from a number of causes including enemy attacks , detainee - on - detainee violence , battlefield injuries , and natural causes			1
" one concern noted by the @entity3 is the amount of deaths that involved cardiac problems : over 25 %			0
the group says it is looking into this finding			0
" this could potentially raise serious questions about the conditions of confinement or interrogation of the detainees , " the @entity3 said			2
the @entity3 obtained the 2,624 pages of documents through a @entity21 request filed with the government in 2009			2
the package included about 124 autopsy and 133 investigation reports .			0
