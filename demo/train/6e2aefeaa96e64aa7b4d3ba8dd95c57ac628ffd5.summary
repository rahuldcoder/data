@entity0 -- president @entity2 will unveil wednesday a package of gun control proposals that , according to a source , will include universal background checks and bans on assault weapons and high - capacity magazines			1
@entity2 and vice president @entity12 will announce the proposals , @entity11 spokesman @entity10 told reporters on tuesday			2
they will be joined by a group of children who wrote letters to the president in the aftermath of the december 14 shooting rampage by a lone gunman who killed 20 students and six adults at a @entity25 , @entity24 elementary school , @entity10 said			1
@entity2 will propose legislative steps he previously has backed , such as a ban on assault weapons , restrictions on high - capacity ammunition magazines and strengthening federal background checks of people attempting to buy guns , according to @entity10			1
the president also will push for other steps that could include executive actions on his part that do n't require congressional approval , @entity10 noted			1
more specifically , the source -- an official familiar with the process -- said the president 's proposal will press for a ban on high capacity magazines with more than 10 rounds , universal background checks and a request that funds be made available to help treat mental illness and provide schools with support to enhance their safety			1
@entity12 led a panel assembled by @entity2 to examine gun control steps after the @entity25 shootings , which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings with guns			2
opponents led by the powerful @entity59 promise a political fight against gun control measures that they say will violate the constitutional right to bear arms			2
an @entity59 spokesman said tuesday the group has experienced what he called an " unprecedented " spike in membership numbers since new calls for gun control began in the past month			2
approximately 250,000 people have joined the organization 's existing 4.25 million members , according to @entity59 spokesman @entity74			2
" this is in direct response to the threats and accusations coming from " @entity2 and other political leaders , @entity74 said , adding that " if anyone is wondering if the @entity83 people cared about the @entity84 ... those numbers give a very clear answer			1
" in addition to new members , the @entity59 is also receiving an influx of financial contributions , he said			2
" this is going to be a very expensive and hard - fought fight , " @entity74 noted			2
the federal government estimates that more than 300 million non-military guns are owned or available for purchase in the @entity83			2
at the @entity11 , @entity10 acknowledged the challenge , saying : " if these things were easy , they would have been achieved already			2
" " it 's something we have to do together , " he said			0
" it 's something that can not be done by a president alone			0
it ca n't be done by a single community alone or a mayor or a governor or by @entity105 alone			0
we all have to work together			0
" @entity10 also reiterated @entity2 's belief in the @entity84 right of citizens to be armed			0
" he has made clear that he believes we ought to take common sense , and enact common sense measures that protect second amendment rights but prevent people who should not have weapons from obtaining them , " he said			1
@entity10 said the proposals @entity2 will present wednesday would be his final version of the package recommended by @entity12 's team			0
the recommendations by @entity12 's panel included as many as 19 executive actions , such as tougher enforcement of existing laws , legislators briefed by the vice president said tuesday			0
@entity2 could demand that agencies provide data for background checks that are supposed to accompany gun sales , ensuring that information included in the checks is as " comprehensive and complete as possible , " @entity133 rep. @entity132 of @entity134 told @entity1			1
the president also could immediately appoint a director of the @entity137 , which has been without a permanent chief for six years , @entity132 said			0
a @entity133 member of @entity105 who was briefed on the recommendations said some of the 19 executive actions discussed included improving the way the government administers current law			0
the legislator , speaking on condition of not being identified , cited loopholes in the federal database for background checks on gun sales as well as issues involving mental health checks as possibilities for executive action			1
across the country , more than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records , drug use or mental health issues , according to @entity157 figures			1
that figure , however , is a small fraction of overall gun sales			0
none of the legislators mentioned the @entity59 's call for armed guards at school as an option under consideration			1
@entity2 has not ruled out issuing executive orders on some gun control measures to enforce laws already on the books , such as bolstering the way gun sales are tracked			0
the president reiterated his desire on monday for more robust background checks for gun buyers , keeping high capacity magazines away from criminals , and a ban on assault weapons			1
" will all of them get through this @entity105 ? i do n't know , " @entity2 said			0
" but what 's uppermost in my mind is making sure that i 'm honest with the @entity83 people and members of @entity105 about what i think will work , what i think is something that will make a difference			0
" working with @entity105 will be paramount in curbing gun violence , @entity132 said , singling out a ban on high capacity magazines as an example of a measure that could garner @entity202 support			1
a full - scale assault weapon ban would be tougher to pass the @entity202 - controlled @entity11 , he argued			1
@entity2 also said on monday that the gun lobby was " ginning up " fears the federal government will use the @entity24 tragedy to seize @entity83 ' guns			1
at least part of the frenzy is little more than marketing , he implied			1
" it 's certainly good for business , " the president said , responding to a question about a spike in weapons sales and applications for background checks since the december killings			1
@entity12 has said he 's found widespread support for universal background checks and restrictions on the sale of high capacity magazines , which gun control advocates believe contribute to more bloodshed at mass shootings			1
the influential @entity59 , among other gun rights groups , has vowed to fight any new gun restrictions -- like an assault weapon ban			1
gun control advocates , gun violence victims , the @entity59 , video game makers and others have met with the @entity12 - led task force			0
in @entity236 , @entity133 gov. @entity235 on tuesday signed into law a series of new gun regulations -- the nation 's first since the @entity25 shootings			0
both @entity236 's @entity202 - controlled @entity243 and @entity244 - controlled @entity242 approved the measure by overwhelming margins			0
it includes a statewide gun registry and adds a uniform licensing standard across the state , altering the current system , in which each county or municipality sets a standard			0
residents are also restricted to purchasing ammunition magazines that carry seven bullets , rather than 10			1
" the changes in @entity236 are largely cosmetic , " said @entity1 legal analyst @entity258 , who described existing regulations as " the toughest gun laws in the @entity83			0
" lawmakers in at least 10 other states are reviewing some form of new gun regulations in the new year			1
meanwhile , new national polls indicated a majority of @entity83 support some or most gun control measures			0
by a 51 % -45 % margin , @entity83 questioned in a new @entity270 poll said it was more important to control gun ownership than to protect gun rights			0
and by a 52 % -35 % margin , a new @entity276 / @entity275 survey indicates the public says it is more likely to support some forms of gun control after last month 's massacre			2
however , the polls showed continuing divisions on political and gender lines			0
@entity285 watching with interest @entity1 's @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this report .			0

new : assault weapons ban , universal background checks are part of plan , says official
new : so is a ban on magazines with more than 10 rounds , the official says
moves are a response to the december massacre at a @entity24 school
