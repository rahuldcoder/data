@entity0 , the @entity2 running back suspended by the @entity3 for two games after video showed him dragging his unconscious then - fianc√©e from an elevator , told reporters thursday his actions were " inexcusable			1
" " you know that 's not me , " he said			2
" you know that 's something i have to live ... with the rest of my life			2
" @entity3 commissioner @entity17 said last week the running back would be suspended without pay for the first two games of the regular season			1
@entity0 indicted on assault charge he also was fined an additional game check for " conduct detrimental to the @entity3 , " according to a league news release			1
the total amount @entity0 loses in pay reportedly amounts to $ 529,411			1
@entity0 resolved the charges stemming from the incident with his now - wife , @entity29 , and entered a pretrial intervention program in may , the @entity3 said			1
under the program , he wo n't be prosecuted , and the charges will be expunged after a year , the league said			1
the punishments , both from the @entity3 and criminal justice system , were widely decried as too light , and it quickly spiraled into debates over domestic violence and victim blaming			2
@entity38 , an @entity39 columnist , asked what message the suspension sent to the women who make up 45 % of the @entity3 's audience			2
she said that an @entity3 official assured her the league does n't tolerate domestic violence , " but today i think we 're seeing a little bit of a different message -- and one that might be a lot louder			2
" fellow @entity51 commentator @entity50 was suspended by the network for a week after advising women not to behave in a way that might " provoke wrong actions " -- an assertion colleague @entity57 publicly lambasted , tweeting , " i 'm now aware that i can provoke my own beating			2
" @entity50 has since apologized to @entity57 and said he will strive to be more articulate in the future			0
meanwhile , @entity61 anchor @entity60 took to a soap box to ask point - blank : " what was the @entity3 thinking ? " she questioned coach @entity66 's decision to call @entity0 a " heck of a guy " and the @entity2 ' decision to tweet : " @entity69 says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident			1
" @entity60 also invoked many observers ' dismay over the suspension of @entity76 receiver @entity75 , who was suspended for a year after testing positive for marijuana			0
however , @entity75 's suspension for a second positive drug test is dictated by the league 's 2011 collective bargaining agreement , where @entity17 is judge and jury when it comes to suspensions and fines for off - the - field conduct			0
speaking at thursday 's news conference , @entity0 said he let down his family , teammates and the city of @entity91			1
he said he knows his 2 - year - old daughter might read about this on @entity94 one day			0
" i let so many people down because of 30 seconds in my life that you know i know i ca n't take back			0
" @entity0 apologized to his wife and called her an " angel " who could do " no wrong			1
" " we 're in counseling			0
we 're taking the necessary steps to move forward , " he said			0
" my job is to lead my family , my job is to lead my wife , my job is to lead in whatever i do			0
and if i 'm not being the example , then my family crumbles			0
he said violence -- " especially man on woman " -- is wrong and should n't be " tolerated			1
" he said he and his wife will speak out about domestic violence			0
" when the time is right we will go out there and help as many people as we can , " he said .			0
