-- what if everything you thought you knew about education was wrong ? what if students learn more quickly on their own , working in teams , than in a classroom with a teacher ? what if tests and discipline get in the way of the learning process rather than accelerate it ? those are the questions @entity16 has been asking since the late 1990s , and for which he was awarded the $ 1 million @entity18 in february at the @entity20 conference			1
@entity21 , professor of educational technology at @entity23 , won the prize for his concept of " self organized learning environments , " an alternative to traditional schooling that relies on empowering students to work together on computers with broadband access to solve their own problems , with adults intervening to provide encouragement and admiration , rather than top - down instruction			1
watch @entity16 's @entity18 talk @entity21 's work with students in @entity41 has gained wide attention and was the focus of a 2010 @entity44 on his " hole in the wall " experiment , showing the potential of computers to jump - start learning without any adult intervention			1
coming to education trained as a physicist , @entity21 said he was encouraged by his boss to start teaching people how to write computer programs			1
when he bought his first personal computer , he was surprised to find that his 6 - year - old son was able to tell him how to fix problems he had operating the machine			0
he thought his son was a genius , but then heard his friends saying the same thing about their children			0
thinking about children living in slums in @entity68 , he said , " it ca n't be possible that our sons are geniuses and they are not			0
" @entity21 set up a publicly accessible computer along the lines of a bank @entity74 , behind a glass barrier , and told children they could use it , with no further guidance			2
@entity44 : @entity16 's five favorite @entity44 on education they soon learned to browse the web in @entity82 , even though they lacked facility in the language			2
to prove the experiment would work in an isolated environment , he set up another " hole in the wall " computer in a village 300 miles away			0
after a while , " one of the kids was saying we need a faster processor and a better mouse			0
" when the head of the @entity99 came to see the experiment , @entity21 said he encouraged him to go to the @entity68 slum and see for himself			2
after spending time with the children , bank president @entity115 " came back and put his hand on my shoulder and said , ' how much ? ' " @entity21 said he received $ 1.5 million , which allowed him to press on with experiments in @entity41 , @entity104 and @entity105 , finding self - organized learning worked to improve @entity82 - language pronunciation , reading comprehension and even the basics of dna replication			1
@entity21 said the traditional system of education is largely based on the necessities created by @entity121 's colonial empire in which a vast amount of territory had to be governed by people writing things on paper and sending them around the world on ships			2
schools turned out clerks who functioned as interchangeable parts in a vast bureaucracy where the skills of reading , writing and arithmetic were key			0
he argues that today 's world needs a new system in which the role of computers in aiding learning is paramount			0
@entity44 : a q&a with @entity16 to help speed learning , @entity21 has recruited hundreds of " grannies , " volunteers from the @entity121 , many of them retired teachers , who function more in the role of " grandparents " than teachers , skypeing into learning environments around the world , encouraging students to do their best and praising their achievements			1
with the @entity18 money , @entity21 intends to build a laboratory , most likely in @entity41 , where he can test his theories through experiments that supplement schoolwork			1
he likens it to a " safe cybercafe for children " where they can strengthen their @entity82 skills , which can be a route to economic advancement			0
@entity21 said he does n't think teachers are obsolete but suggests their roles may be changing as students increasingly have access to self - learning through computers			1
and he argues that his self - organized teams may be an alternative to regular schools in places where teachers may not be available			1
traditional education stresses tests and punishments , two things that @entity21 said causes the brain to shut down its rational processes and surrender to fear			2
adopting a method closer to that of grandparents , who shower children with admiration , is " the opposite of the parent method , " which relies on threats , @entity21 said			0

@entity21 says his *research* shows the learning power of self - organized student teams
he says instruction need not be top down and the role of teachers is shifting
he hopes to use prize money to build a lab to test his ideas about learning
