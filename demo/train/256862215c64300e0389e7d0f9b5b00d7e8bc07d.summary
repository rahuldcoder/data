-- if you want to earn big bucks as a sportsman then @entity1 is the place to be			0
playing @entity6 , baseball or basketball in the @entity9 has often been thought of as the way to earn top dollar , but not any more , according to a new survey			2
so if you are a star in need of a bumper pay rise then hotfoot to @entity15 , which is the best paid team in global sport , according to @entity18 's @entity17 for 2014 , compiled in association with @entity21 @entity20			1
according to the report , which looked at 294 teams in 15 leagues in 12 countries across seven different sports , the average first - team player to ply their trade at the @entity30 club earns $ 8,969,407 per year , or $ 172,488 per week			1
@entity9 baseball outfits @entity32 and @entity33 are ranked second and third -- with annual salaries of $ 8,882,746 and $ 8,603,482 respectively -- but six of the top 10 teams surveyed are from @entity1			2
the @entity32 held the coveted top spot in 2010 , when the inaugural survey was conducted , with its players earning an average of $ 7.89 million per year			1
however , @entity1 is now the dominant force after @entity43 ousted the @entity32 in 2011 , with an average of $ 8.2 million per year , before holding onto the position for the following year			1
by 2013 , @entity15 had become the best paid team in global sport -- and their players ' salaries show no sign of stagnating			1
" the perception in the past has always been that sports players in @entity9 can earn the major bucks , " @entity18 editor @entity51 told @entity0			2
" but what this survey shows is that actually @entity1 can also pay those big bucks and has the ability to compete with @entity9			0
" perhaps the biggest misconception when it comes to wages in sport is that @entity65 players take home some of the heftiest pay packets			0
although that may be true to some extent -- @entity69 of the @entity70 made the top five of @entity73 ' " @entity74 " list last year -- the reality is that the majority of players are not so lucky			0
" in the @entity65 , each team has about 100 players , with around 53 on their active roster , yet only two or three or so will earn $ 20 million a year			1
the rest will be paid $ 400,000 to $ 1 million a year , " @entity51 said			1
" the majority of people , if you ask them which sport have the best paid teams , will say @entity65 because of the @entity87 and @entity88 -- it 's huge			1
" but most do n't know that is not the case as not everyone is well paid			0
" this is the reason @entity18 started this survey			0
to compare different sports and demonstrate these misconceptions surrounding the different sports			0
" @entity101 deal in contrast , @entity15 have the cash to be able to afford to pay the majority of their players a higher wage , rather than just a select few			1
however , the @entity108 is the highest paying league as a whole -- 441 players at 30 teams in the 2013 - 14 season each earned an average of $ 5 million per year -- with the @entity114 in third			1
the @entity30 , meanwhile , sits fourth , with @entity117 's @entity116 languishing in ninth			0
why , then , the dominance of @entity1 football clubs when it comes to paying their players ? " billionaires help fuel wages , " @entity51 said			0
" @entity125 has spent around $ 1.67 billion since arriving at @entity126 in 2003 , while there has been a net spend of $ 1.67 billion on transfers and wages at @entity15 since @entity132 's arrival in 2008			2
" as for other @entity30 clubs , tv money has driven wage inflation			0
it has done so in elite @entity1 football and in @entity138 since the early 1990s and particularly in the last decade			0
and it is continuing to rise			0
" last year the @entity30 sold its broadcasting rights to @entity141 and @entity142 in a record - breaking deal worth around $ 4.98 billion , while overseas tv deals brought in another $ 3.35 billion			2
that in turn allowed @entity15 to pay the likes of @entity148 and @entity149 so handsomely , while making its first - team players the best paid in sport .			1
