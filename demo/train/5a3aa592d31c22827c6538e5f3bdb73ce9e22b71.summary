-- on tuesday night , president @entity1 will deliver his fifth @entity3 message			1
he will declare to a dysfunctional @entity4 , weakened by years of gridlock , that the union is sound -- even if effectively only two - thirds of the government is functioning			1
@entity1 will discuss sustained growth in jobs , the economy and health care ; partnering with the private sector ; working with educators , mayors , governors -- anyone who 's willing to get the job done			1
he 'll outline plans to repair an endangered planet 's environment , to strengthen our arms and cyber defenses , to put immigration reform behind us and a stronger workforce ahead of us			0
the @entity27 says three words summarize @entity1 's message : " opportunity , action and optimism			1
" and @entity34 cynics respond with cliched eye - rolling , muttering , " sure , sure			0
" the clock -- so they say -- is ticking down on the last three years of his administration			0
maybe @entity1 is planting policy and nurturing programs that will bear fruit long after he leaves office			1
@entity4 , on the other hand ... opinion : @entity1 , the pain and fear must be named in the past , @entity1 urged the @entity4 to " @entity47			1
" instead , it seized the government , bringing it to a grinding halt			0
house speaker @entity51 acknowledged the @entity52 were to blame , and that the action hurt the @entity4 , which has only 19 % of the public 's confidence			1
( @entity1 's approval rating has grown to 44 % , regaining as the health care website improves			2
) @entity58 , a noted political science scholar at @entity60 , and @entity61 led several colleagues in examining the impact that a gridlocked , partisan @entity4 is having on our political system of checks and balances			1
it was a substudy by an @entity70 task force , convened by @entity73 political theorist @entity71 and @entity75 political scientist @entity74			0
@entity76 : the misdirection of a president the panel concluded that " sincere ideological differences " caused the gridlock -- as well as " strategic behavior to exploit those differences to win elections			0
" " consequently , " it found that partisan " polarization has reduced congressional capacity to govern			0
" @entity4 is " ... more prone to delays in appropriating funds , and increasingly slow in handling executive and judicial appointments			2
" no surprise , there -- it 's evident to any onlooker that these showdowns over the budget and debt are as much about " winning " as they are about convictions			0
the loser , though , has not been the other ( @entity102 ) party , but our constitutional system			1
@entity104 : why @entity1 is playing a weak hand " of significant concern , " @entity58 wrote in the @entity115 , " is the extent to which this reduction in legislative capacity has contributed to a shift in the constitutional balance as it enhanced opportunities for executive and judicial encroachments on legislative prerogatives			1
" in other words , a @entity4 that obstructs the public 's election mandates and refuses to compromise only weakens itself			2
@entity51 boasted after the 2012 debt face - off that @entity52 got " 98 % of what we wanted			0
regardless , the @entity122 people are not getting what they need			0
the signs of growing congressional weakness are everywhere			0
this past week , @entity126 , @entity127 , mayor @entity128 , president of the @entity129 , said , " the partnership between local and federal government is not as strong now as it once was			0
" @entity132 : @entity52 misguided and obsessed @entity128 , a @entity4 who will run for governor of @entity127 this year , added , " instead of @entity4 pulling together to help working @entity122 , there is an all - out assault on programs that would help them			1
" he described his fellow mayors as a " pragmatic bunch who care more about finding solutions than about focusing on ideological differences			0
" that description also fits @entity1 , whom studies have shown to be the " most moderate president since @entity147 " perhaps that moderate , @entity148 - like , approach accounts for some of his difficulties last year			1
( by the way , @entity1 is the only the president since @entity153 to win back - to - back elections with more than 51 % of the vote			1
) while 2013 was n't as bad for @entity1 as some pundits claim , it clearly could have been better			1
@entity1 will try , as he has for five years , to forge bipartisan compromises on an agenda that moves this changing nation forward			2
if @entity4 balks , again , he 'll do what the mayors are doing : find a way to move forward			2
@entity164 : dems should do more on poverty the @entity27 released a statement over the weekend , saying " the president has a pen and he has a phone , and he will use them to take executive actions and enlist every @entity122 -- from business owners , workers , mayors and state legislators to young people , veterans , and folks in communities across the country -- in the project to restore opportunity for all			0
" our constitutional system demands cooperation and compromise			1
but the @entity189 believed that factions in @entity4 would share one principle : common national goals trumped party , and to achieve those goals , bipartisan deals were better than no deals			2
such had been the @entity189 ' hope and the reality for many a @entity4 in the past			2
alas , such a @entity4 no longer exists			2
the future will be forged			0
@entity1 will adapt to the congressional realities of today -- even if that means moving ahead without @entity4 by issuing executive orders as constitutionally defined and reaching beyond @entity4 to the @entity122 people and their leaders , local and state , public and private			1
right on , mr. president			0
time to move the country forward			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

@entity211 says that a dysfunctional @entity4 wo n't stop a determined president
@entity211 : @entity1 nurturing programs that will bear fruit long after he leaves office
@entity211 : the loser in this system has n't been @entity102 , but our constitutional system
