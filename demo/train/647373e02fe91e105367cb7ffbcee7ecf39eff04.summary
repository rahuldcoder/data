-- @entity2 president @entity1 has quit in the wake of a @entity6 judge 's decision to investigate the deal that brought @entity9 superstar @entity8 to the club			1
@entity1 announced at a press conference thursday he was tendering his " irrevocable resignation " after three - and - a - half years in charge of the current @entity6 champions			1
on wednesday a judge agreed to hear a case centered on the $ 78 million transfer of @entity8 from @entity18 in june after a complaint from one of @entity2 's own members			1
@entity1 vigorously asserted his innocence in front a packed media conference and described the allegations as " unfair and reckless			1
" he will be replaced by vice-president @entity26 who said the current board would continue until the end of their mandate in 2016			1
" in recent days an unfair and reckless accusation of misappropriation has resulted in a lawsuit against me in the @entity36 , " he told reporters -- a statement that was later reproduced on @entity2 's official website			1
" from the beginning i have said that the signing of @entity8 has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries			1
" " the board of directors is a team			0
and this team leads a project that has brought the @entity48 great success			0
i do n't want unfair attacks to negatively affect their management or the image of the club			0
" this is why i think my time here has come to an end			0
" now , in accordance with the @entity58 , i have presented my irrevocable resignation of the presidency of @entity2 to the @entity61			2
" from this moment , the first vice-president of the club , @entity26 , will immediately assume the presidency of the club until the end of the term , through 2016 , just as the @entity61 unanimously agreed a few moments ago			1
" @entity1 took over as president in 2010 after succeeding @entity70			2
during his time in charge the club won the @entity74 title twice and also secured the 2011 @entity76 crown			0
he attracted criticism in some quarters for a huge sponsorship deal with the @entity80 that saw the club bear a sponsor 's name on their shirts for the first time			0
after they signed @entity8 from @entity18 , the club announced the deal was worth $ 78 million , but the breakdown of the agreement was never revealed			2
a @entity2 member launched a case against @entity1 for not disclosing the full details and the club was asked by @entity6 authorities to hand over documentation , as well as accounts for the past three years			1
on wednesday judge @entity94 decided an investigation should go ahead , leading to thursday 's dramatic press conference			2
@entity1 touched on the success @entity2 had enjoyed during his reign but said it had brought " very difficult moments			1
" " for some time my family and myself have suffered threats and attacks in silence , " he said			0
" these threats and attacks have made me wonder if being president means having to jeopardize my family			0
" in all of these years we have seen that our successes are the result of our victories on the pitch and overcoming innumerable obstacles off the pitch : political , external and , what 's worse , at times the pressure has come from our own environment			0
" it has been an honor to serve the @entity118			0
it 's been a privilege to be the president of @entity2			2
i wish the best to the new president and i ask the club members to support him			0
