-- @entity1 is not a size zero			1
she 's not a size 6 or 16 either			2
she wears a @entity5 size 26 , has no plans to change that and she 'd be more than happy to share her style advice with you			2
@entity1 , a 35 - year - old associate editor at @entity10 and author of the upcoming " @entity12 , " is part of an increasingly popular online movement that celebrates fashion for larger women -- without a tent dress or body - camouflaging cardigan in sight			1
the authors of so - called " fatshion " blogs -- with names like @entity23 , @entity24 for the @entity25 , @entity26 to kill and @entity27 -- seek to send an empowering message to their plus - sized sisters : we 're here , we 're fat , we look just fabulous -- and you can , too			1
" @entity23 " is a loaded word , often wielded as a weapon , but @entity1 hopes to lessen its power to wound			1
" learning to use the word ' fat ' as a basic descriptor , stripping it of its negative baggage , was a huge part of my self - acceptance process , " she says			1
" some women never get comfortable with it , and i understand that -- for some , it 's been used as a weapon for too long for anything positive to be salvaged			1
" but i love the word ' fat ' precisely because my candid and positive use of it often shocks people ... it means everyone who hears the word ' fat ' from me is having to take a moment to think about what i mean by it , and to resist the knee - jerk assumption that i must mean something bad			1
" with that in mind , she created a blog , @entity63 , in 2007			2
though many of the original postings are now archived at her " body politics , social justice activism and pop - cultural criticism " blog , @entity70 , her writing shares a body - positive message for women she feels are not represented as beautiful and desirable in mainstream media			1
growing up , she says , " i did n't have many famous examples of positive fat - lady representation			1
i mean , there was @entity79			2
i loved @entity79 , but not because she was beautiful -- i loved her because she was smart and tough and did n't take crap from anyone			1
" fat girls representing themselves as confident , smart and resourceful is key , @entity1 says			1
" if we wait for television and magazines to do this for us , we 're going to be waiting a very long time , " she says			1
" so we do it ourselves			2
" @entity89 , creator of @entity90 ( tagline " @entity94 is perfect ! " ) and owner of @entity93 , agrees with the importance of owning words as a first step to self - acceptance			1
some girls might see themselves as curvy , while others see themselves as plus - sized			1
she says , " i do embrace the word ' fat , ' because i am			1
it 's not mean or spiteful , but a fact			2
" @entity106 recalls , " i grew up in a broken home with no role models , and was tortured in high school for not being cool enough and never had a boyfriend			2
it was after high school and realizing the larger world around me and being exposed to plus - size fashion via the @entity115 that i started to see i was not the minority and there were women who were confident and my size			1
those women gave me strength , and i hope to pass that along as well			0
" with her blog , she 's taken control of the message in the way an occasional " special section " or magazine insert never would			0
" the majority of women need to be represented , and blogs like mine that thrive with hundreds of thousands of views a month show that there are women who want to see more			0
we need the thin girls next to the big girls as well as the brown girls next to the white girls			0
diversity is key , " @entity106 says			0
" there 's nothing more empowering than connecting with women just like you			0
no matter what you 're going through , you are n't alone			0
" the problem for many women , no matter their level of body acceptance , is simply finding attractive clothes in their size			0
it 's easy for bigger women to feel like no trendy clothes exist in their size , and they have no right to wear them , to be seen , to be active participants in fashion			1
as @entity1 says , " the fatter you get the harder it is			1
" bloggers share their plus - sized fashion finds from mainstream retailers like @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 , as well as delving into more niche designers and outlets like @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and the @entity26 line from @entity173			1
they post pictures and links from the catalogues -- or even of themselves modeling the clothes , looking confident and gorgeous as all get out			0
@entity180 , an 21 - year - old @entity181 woman who blogs at @entity182 says she 's a " 5 ' 3 " - apple - shaped - plus - sized - gal " who carries her weight in her midsection , so even fashion for large girls rarely fits her			1
her secret is to remain open to possibilities			0
" the best way to find clothes is just to go out shopping and do n't restrict yourself			0
i used to avoid the ' normal ' side of @entity196 's store and go straight for the plus section -- but now i browse the whole store			0
if i see something i like in the regular section , i try it on			0
most times , if it 's a stretchy or knit fabric , then a size large will fit me , " @entity180 says			0
designer @entity204 noticed this inequity in the marketplace and decided to expand her already popular @entity208 clothing line to , as her company 's tagline says , dress " stylish women from xxs - xxxl			1
" " i truly believe that there is room for woman to feel sexy in their clothes			0
i saw a definite need for a wider size range in the market			1
it 's not fair for just the tiny ladies to have the best selection , " @entity204 says			0
" i think that the key is not to forget that larger gals still have a shape and it is n't square			0
" her bold , curve - hugging clothing ( she has an item called the " everybody loves @entity231 " ) has become a favorite of the plus - sized blogosphere , as well as the generally body - positive burlesque community			1
she sees the lack of flattering clothing as a result of social prejudice , rather than a result of any perceived figure flaws			0
" it 's much easier to design for curves , " she notes			0
for @entity1 , @entity106 and @entity180 , there are tremendous rewards in helping other women realize their beauty potential , but it has not been without risks			1
it is , after all , the @entity115 , and with that , the inevitable rain of anonymous hostility from people offended that a larger woman would dare to find herself attractive			0
" the people who get angriest about fat girls looking good and feeling hot are the people who are the most strongly invested in the idea that a person has to be skinny in order to be happy , healthy , and loved , " @entity1 says			1
" very often it 's people just projecting their own body - loathing onto someone else ; if you 're truly comfortable and confident in your own skin , it should n't make a difference to you what anyone else is wearing , or how they look			2
it only affects you if it 's making you question your assumptions , about both other people and about yourself			0
" @entity180 says she 's weathered worse in person			0
when people see a bigger girl enjoying herself , they 're shocked , she says			0
at a club with her friends , a man referred to her as the " fat bitch			2
" she responded , " yes , i 'm fat , so what ? " the look on his face , she says , was priceless			2
" where i live , most women over a size 16 tend to wear long skirts and baggy dresses , so people sometimes double - take when they see a big girl in a mini dress or cute blouse and heels			1
" @entity106 chalks the reactions up to jealousy and notes that in the bigger - girl blogosphere , it can cut both ways			2
" that person judging and knocking a thinner woman for feeling great is probably jealous that that person feels so great about themselves , and secretly wishing they had that too , " she says			0
@entity1 , however , has found the negative response to be an extreme minority , and their invective is greatly outweighed by the reward			1
she routinely get grateful emails from people of all sizes , people dealing with or recovering from eating disorders , even men			2
" it 's very humbling			0
" and it 's worth it to @entity180 to keep putting herself out there in such a public way , no matter the challenges			0
while it 's empowering to look beautiful on the outside , " life is too short to be hung up on appearance , " she says			2
" at the end of the day , its just your outer shell -- there 's a whole personality underneath that 's just waiting to shine			0
and even if you do n't realize how beautiful you are , someone else is out there who thinks you are the most beautiful person in the world			2
" even if it 's a stranger , looking at you through a screen .			0
