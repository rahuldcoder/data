-- the @entity3 has launched an investigation into apparent leaks of classified information involving a cyberwarfare program against @entity8 , a @entity2 official said wednesday			1
@entity3 spokesman @entity9 had no comment on the reported investigation			1
sen. @entity12 , ranking @entity13 on the @entity14 , said he was informed that an @entity3 inquiry was under way			1
the senator from @entity18 and other leaders of the @entity21 and @entity20 issued a joint statement tuesday deploring the apparent leaks			1
" in recent weeks , we have become increasingly concerned at the continued leaks regarding sensitive intelligence programs and activities , including specific details of sources and methods , " said @entity12 ; chairwoman @entity31 , @entity32 ; chairman @entity34 , @entity35 ; and ranking member c.a. " @entity39 " @entity33 , @entity37 , in the statement			1
" these disclosures have seriously interfered with ongoing intelligence programs and have put at jeopardy our intelligence capability to act in the future			0
each disclosure puts @entity2 lives at risk , makes it more difficult to recruit assets , strains the trust of our partners and threatens imminent and irreparable damage to our national security in the face of urgent and rapidly adapting threats worldwide			2
" the @entity21 and @entity14 leaders said they intended " to review potential legislation to strengthen authorities and procedures with respect to access to classified information and disclosure of it , as well as to ensure that criminal and administrative measures are taken each time sensitive information is improperly disclosed			1
" " we also intend to press for the executive branch to take tangible and demonstrable steps to detect and deter intelligence leaks , and to fully , fairly , and impartially investigate the disclosures that have already taken place			2
" the committee is expected to add leak provisions later this month , when it takes up the @entity77 intelligence authorization bill			0
the plan is for the @entity14 to vote on the measure before the summer recess			0
although the @entity21 has already passed a version of the bill without the leak provisions , they would likely be added during a conference with the @entity14			2
spyware infiltrating @entity8 computers the @entity21 pushed back against suggestions it could be leaking classified information for political purposes			1
" this administration takes all appropriate and necessary steps to prevent leaks of classified information or sensitive information that could risk ongoing counterterrorism or intelligence operations , " spokesman @entity90 said wednesday aboard @entity92 as the president traveled to campaign events on the @entity94			2
" any suggestion that this administration has authorized intentional leaks of classified information for political gain is grossly irresponsible			1
" asked about the @entity21 's response , sen. @entity107 told @entity110 's " @entity109 , " " i would expect nothing else from the @entity21			1
but the fact is that the portrayal of the president in these stories is nothing short of heroic			0
" the ranking member of the @entity118 added , " clearly , administration officials were involved			0
" @entity107 , @entity120 , said he has " great faith " in the @entity3 but that a matter as weighty as national security " probably deserves a special counsel			2
" he continued , " it 's clear that the @entity8 will profit from having this information			2
in fact , they might even feel they are justified in cybercounterattacks			0
" @entity31 told @entity0 's " @entity133 with @entity134 " that she did n't believe any of the information came from the top ranks of the @entity21			1
" i think one of the problems is , information is not closely held sufficiently , " she said			0
she described policies regarding responding to leaks as " archaic " and said they need to be revamped			2
the government 's failure to keep its secrets has dissuaded some people from giving information to the @entity2 and has endangered lives , she said , but she is unaware of anyone having been killed as a result			1
she would not go into specifics			0
" people just talk too much , " she said			2
" this did n't used to be the case			0
but suddenly it 's like it 's a spreadable disease			0
" @entity155 , the @entity156 chairman of the @entity157 , expressed confidence wednesday that the @entity21 played no role in the apparent leaks			1
" i know that people at the @entity21 were not involved , " he said			1
he disputed @entity107 's assertion to the contrary			0
" @entity107 needs to know , before people make that kind of accusation , the reporters themselves have said it did not come from anybody on the @entity172 team or on the @entity156 side or anything like that , " @entity155 said			0
" i take that at face value			0
" but he said such a leak " endangers our long - term security			0
" a report in the @entity182 on friday provided classified details of what it described as a @entity2 cyberattack targeting @entity8 's nuclear centrifuge program			1
since shortly after he became president , @entity172 has ordered cyberattacks targeting computers that run @entity8 's nuclear enrichment facilities , the report said , attributing the information to participants in the program			1
the @entity21 has said it did not authorize any leak of such information			2
@entity107 said @entity118 chairman @entity198 has agreed to hold a hearing on the matter			0
some republicans , including @entity107 , have called for a special prosecutor to investigate			0
but deputy attorney general @entity207 , in response to a question from sen. @entity205 , @entity206 , said wednesday that he does not believe a special prosecutor is needed in this case			0
@entity12 said he expects the @entity3 to conduct a " full and fair investigation , including a review of administration officials who have been quoted anonymously or directly			1
" @entity31 said she had discussed the possibility of a joint hearing with @entity198			2
on tuesday , @entity21 deputy press secretary @entity216 said the administration believes that classified information should remain secret for a reason , and " publicizing it would pose a threat to our national security			1
" @entity107 and @entity12 cited other recent leaks as well , including information on the administration 's efforts to expand its drone program and the president 's involvement in " kill lists " against militants in @entity232 and @entity233			1
