@entity0 has once again been rocked by a violent attack targeting civilians after two suvs plowed into people gathered at an open market in @entity6 , the capital of the western @entity0 region of @entity8			1
explosives were tossed from the vehicles , before one of the @entity3 exploded , leaving many shoppers dead or wounded on the streets as flames and smoke billowed from the scene			0
the incident left 31 dead and more than 90 others hurt , according to @entity19 , @entity0 's state - run news agency			1
the brazen act was described by @entity0 's @entity21 as " a serious violent terrorist incident " and it vowed to crack down on the perpetrators			1
it was the latest in a series of deadly attacks in public places in @entity0 in the past few months			1
it also put the spotlight once again on @entity8 , a region with a long history of friction between @entity32 , @entity0 's biggest and most dominant ethnic group , and the indigenous @entity34 , a mainly @entity37 - speaking @entity36 population			1
what happened in the recent attacks ? -- april 30 , 2014 : after @entity0 president @entity41 had wrapped up a visit to @entity8 , an explosion rocked the @entity43 of @entity6 , followed by a knife attack at the same location			1
three people died and 79 others were injured in the attacks , according to @entity19 , as " knife - wielding mobs " attacked people at one of the station 's exits following the blast			2
two people , described as religious extremists and part of the @entity58 , were blamed for the incident			0
both died in the blast			0
-- march 1 , 2014 : twenty - nine people were killed and 130 were injured when 10 men armed with long knives stormed the station in the southwest @entity0 city of @entity67			1
@entity67 railway station is one of the largest in southwest @entity0			2
witnesses described men clad in black outfits stabbing and attacking people with cleavers and knives			0
local government officials told @entity19 that evidence at the crime scene indicated " it was orchestrated by @entity8 separatist forces			2
" -- october 28 , 2013 : @entity0 authorities indicated a @entity8 connection when a jeep plowed into crowds in @entity84 , killing five and injuring at least 40			1
who are the @entity34 ? the @entity34 are a predominantly @entity36 ethnic group who live in @entity8 , an area the size of @entity89 that is rich in natural resources , including oil			2
the province shares borders with @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
uyghurs , who speak a language related to @entity104 , regard themselves as culturally and ethnically close to central @entity105 , despite a long history of @entity0 rule			1
since the collapse of the @entity110 in 1912 , @entity8 , which means " new frontier " in @entity0 , has enjoyed varying levels of autonomy			1
in 1933 , rebels declared independence and created the short - lived @entity115 of @entity116			0
the @entity117 took over the territory in 1949 and in 1955 it was declared an autonomous region , giving it a status similar to that of @entity122 , which lies to the south of @entity8			1
why do @entity34 resent @entity0 rule ? over the decades , waves of @entity32 migrants arrived in the region , displacing uyghurs from their traditional lands and fueling tensions			1
@entity8 is now home to more than 8 million @entity32 , up from 220,000 in 1949 , and 10 million @entity34			2
the newcomers take most of the new jobs , and unemployment among @entity34 is high			0
they complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces , despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony			0
activists say that a campaign is being waged to weaken the @entity34 ' religious and cultural traditions and that the education system undermines use of the @entity146			0
why is @entity0 concerned about the @entity34 ? simmering tensions have erupted into riots			2
the worst violence in decades took place in july 2009 , when rioting in @entity6 between @entity34 and @entity32 killed some 200 people and injured 1,700			2
that unrest was followed by a crackdown by security forces			0
@entity155 says @entity34 groups want to establish an independent state and , because of the @entity34 ' cultural ties to their neighbors , leaders fear that elements may back a separatist movement in @entity8			2
what could be triggering attacks in @entity8 ? it could be multiple factors , but @entity0 is increasing its grip over @entity8 society , said @entity169 , senior lecturer of politics and @entity172 studies at @entity173 in @entity174			1
president @entity41 's administration views @entity8 " as a crucial backdoor into @entity105 " -- one that could provide a new @entity179 and economic opportunities			1
there are also natural resources in the province			0
@entity0 has quadrupled internal security budget in @entity8 , he said			1
" it has increased armed patrols as well as security cameras in the region			0
" at the same time , @entity0 has also injected money to boost economic development amongst the @entity34 minority and the @entity32 who live in @entity8 , @entity169 added			1
is the violence in @entity8 getting worse ? " i think these things are cyclical in nature , " said @entity169 , an expert on @entity0 ethnic policy relations			1
" if you look at @entity8 over the last 60 - plus years it 's been under @entity117 rule , the violence ebbs and flows			1
" the 1950s were particularly bloody , as was the @entity200 , and violence was reported in the late 1990s and early 2000s , he said			0
" it 's impossible to confirm that ethnic violence has increased , " he said			0
" the government puts out statistics and all the information we get are bits and pieces			0
" the @entity0 government blames what it calls three evil forces : separatism , extremism and terrorism			2
what is significant in recent violence is that the target of the attacks appear to be shifting to civilians from security forces , he said			2
" we have seen targeting of innocent civilians and places , an attempt to maim innocent civilians in large numbers , " @entity169 said			0
" this violence has seeped outside of @entity8 autonomous region , " he added , referring to the incidents in @entity84 and the @entity67 train station several months ago			1
are there uyghur terrorist groups ? some say the threats from @entity239 groups have been exaggerated and that little of the violence inside @entity8 should be considered terrorism			0
they also say that the civil unrest is carried out by individuals or small groups , rather than an organized militant group			0
however , @entity34 groups have claimed responsibility for bus bombs in @entity249 and @entity250 prior to the @entity251 in 2008			0
the @entity0 government blamed an attempted hijacking of a flight in 2012 on @entity34			1
the @entity255 listed the @entity58 as a terrorist organization in 2002 in the wake of the september 11 attacks during a period of increased cooperation with @entity0 on security matters			2
after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in @entity263 and @entity264 , some 22 @entity34 were rounded up in @entity100 and @entity99 and detained at @entity265			0
the final three ethnic uyghurs were released from @entity265 to @entity267 where they were " voluntarily " resettled early last year .			0
