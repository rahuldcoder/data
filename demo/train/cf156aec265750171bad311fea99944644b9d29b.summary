@entity0 -- some $ 700 million in economic stimulus money intended to upgrade baggage screening systems at airports will go further than originally expected , @entity3 officials said wednesday			1
the new systems can process up to 500 bags an hour , compared to the 150 to 160 bags per hour on the older machines , the @entity7 said			0
the @entity3 said the money will now upgrade systems at 10 additional airports			1
earlier this year the @entity3 announced funding for baggage screening at airports in 15 cities			2
the money will be used to speed up construction of in - line baggage screening systems , which take advantage of the airline 's existing conveyor belt systems to check bags , eliminating the need for minivan - size bomb detection systems now found in many airport lobbies			1
government auditors have long complained about existing systems , which the @entity7 rushed into place to meet congressional deadlines after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
at airports with in - line systems , airline workers at the ticketing counters place the bags on conveyor belts , which pass through explosive detectors on their way to the aircraft			2
that is more efficient than stand - alone systems , which the @entity7 employees must staff			0
in addition , in - line systems can process up to 500 bags an hour , compared to the 150 to 160 bags per hour processed by stand - alone machines , the @entity7 said			1
@entity3 secretary @entity51 said in a statement that @entity3 was able to " stretch our resources " by managing the recovery money and by negotiating with airports			0
in addition to the $ 700 million intended for checked baggage systems , $ 300 million is being allocated for checkpoint technology , such as new x-ray machines , " whole body imaging " technology and bottled liquid scanners			0
