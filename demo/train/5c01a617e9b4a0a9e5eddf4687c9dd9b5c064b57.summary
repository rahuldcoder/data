@entity0 -- the attack on a soldier hacked to death on a @entity0 street has echoes of other plots on @entity9 soil in recent years			1
the victim of wednesday 's attack in @entity12 was a serving soldier based at a nearby barracks , @entity0 police say , and the @entity9 government is treating it as a suspected terrorist attack			1
in 2007 four men were imprisoned over a plot to kidnap and kill a @entity9 @entity21 soldier on leave and behead him in a @entity24 garage			1
the group 's ringleader @entity25 intended to behead the soldier " like a pig " and release footage of the killing on the internet			0
@entity25 was later imprisoned for life and must serve a minimum of 14 years before he will be considered for release			0
three other men , @entity36 , @entity37 , and @entity38 , were handed down sentences of between two and seven years for their roles in the plot			2
high court judge mr @entity42 said @entity25 's aim was to deter any @entity21 from joining the @entity9 army			2
" so rampant are your views , so excitable your temperament , so persuasive your tongue and so imbued with energy are you , it 's quite impossible to predict when , if ever , it will be safe for you to be released into the public , " the @entity46 quoted the judge as saying			0
" it was a plot whose purpose was to undermine democratic government , to demoralize the @entity9 army and to destabilize recruitment , and to cause anguish to the then prime minister of the day and the loyal citizens of the country , " the judge said			2
prosecutors said @entity25 hoped to kidnap the @entity21 soldier in @entity24 's @entity67 entertainment quarter with the help of drug dealers			0
this is not the only recent example of serving soldiers being the targets of terrorist attacks			1
last month three @entity9 - born men were imprisoned for between four and nine years for preparing acts of terrorism			1
the men , who pleaded guilty had discussed targeting @entity79 , a town that became a focal point for parades by @entity9 troops returning from service in @entity84			1
the judge , mr. justice @entity85 , said they had shown themselves to be " committed fundamentalists " ready to kill			0
@entity21 convert @entity87 , a former @entity88 security guard , and co-defandant @entity89 had discussed how to make explosives , with the western @entity92 town as a potential bombing target .			0
