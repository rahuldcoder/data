-- parole officers saw and spoke to @entity2 during visits to the home of the man accused of holding her captive for 18 years , but they never questioned why she was there , @entity11 officials disclose in newly released documents			1
at least three different parole officers spotted @entity14 at the home of @entity2 , a convicted rapist who had been under @entity11 state supervision since 1999 , according to a june memo from the @entity11 attorney general 's office			1
on at least one occasion , a parole officer spoke to her and one of her daughters , whom investigators say @entity25 fathered during her captivity			2
but those officers " failed to investigate their identities or their relationship to @entity25 , " the memo states			1
the document outlines the $ 20 million settlement between @entity14 and @entity11 authorities , which the state legislature approved last week			0
it was drafted to brief state lawmakers on the settlement before their vote , said @entity40 , an attorney general 's office spokeswoman			0
@entity40 would not provide additional details of the reported contact between @entity14 and parole officers			1
@entity14 disappeared in 1991 , at age 11 , and was found in august 2009 at @entity25 's home in @entity47 , about 45 miles east of @entity48			1
@entity25 and his wife , @entity49 , have pleaded not guilty to 29 felony counts in the case			2
@entity25 was released on parole in 1988 after serving less than 12 years of a 50 - to - life sentence for rape in federal and @entity57 prisons			2
his victim in that case , @entity61 , told @entity0 's " issues with @entity64 " that the latest revelation was " unbelievable			0
" " it 's just one more astonishing fact in a long line of errors , " said @entity61 , who is now an advocate for rape victims			1
she said the news " re-triggers my anger " because she had gone to federal authorities -- who initially handled his parole -- to warn that he had approached her after his release , and " i do n't think they believed me			0
" @entity79 for @entity25 's parole was transferred to @entity11 authorities in 1999			2
a november 2009 investigation found parole officers failed to follow utility wires running from @entity25 's house toward the shed where @entity14 was held , did n't check out the presence of a 12 - year - old girl during a visit or act on information that indicated @entity25 had violated the terms of his release			1
the june 25 memo concluded that while the state could have successfully defended some of the claims on procedural grounds , the state @entity102 " recognizes that this case has a unique and tragic character			0
" " obviously , no amount of money could compensate these plaintiffs for what they have endured , " it reads			0
but the settlement will provide @entity14 and her daughters -- now teenagers -- with " the financial support that they will need to rebuild their lives			0
" the document estimates the family will need as much as $ 7 million alone for decades of counseling			0
" first , it is a virtual certainty that ms. @entity14 and her daughters will require counseling for the remainder of their lives , with varying degrees of intensity at different time periods , " it states			0
" second , neither of ms. @entity14 's daughters has received any education , and neither is presently equipped to handle the academic or social challenges that school will pose			1
ms. @entity14 has received no education since her abduction , and all three have expressed their desire to obtain an education			2
