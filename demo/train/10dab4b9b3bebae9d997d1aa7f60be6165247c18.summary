it 's a scavenger hunt for cash through the most modern of means : social media			2
an anonymous , wealthy @entity6 man is hiding up to $ 100 or so in public places in @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 and then posting clues to the money 's whereabouts through his @entity15 page , appropriately dubbed @entity16			1
the $ 100 bills or envelopes containing several $ 20 bills are amounting to $ 1,000 - a - day philanthropy in what the @entity15 account calls " an anonymous social experiment for good			1
" the results have been a feel - good sensation in @entity6 : the @entity15 page features selfies of joyous people who found the money -- flashing smiles and cash -- with testimonials of what they 're going to do next			1
the cash hunts ventured into a third city , @entity10 , on wednesday			2
the anonymous donor and owner of the @entity15 page is a real estate investor who 's had the good fortune of joining the wealthiest 1 % of @entity45 society , especially in the past few years , he said			1
when he recently closed a deal with a six - figure profit , the philanthropist decided to " give some of it back " through random acts of kindness , he told @entity52			1
" this is not a set - up charity , but i wanted to do something fun and creative , " he said			1
" we were thinking of something like the ' @entity59 ' tv show or something of that nature that was a scavenger hunt			0
they were basically too involved			0
so what we did was hide cash in different places			0
i thought it would be fun , but it 's also something simple to execute			0
all you 're doing is leaving money and putting clues on @entity15			1
" the man said he 's between ages 35 and 45 -- and would give no more information			2
he maintains anonymity because he wants the attention on his pay - it - forward activities , not himself			1
" there 's some crazy people out there in the world , " he added			0
this week , he will expand his hunt - for - cash giveaway to @entity83 and possibly other cities across the country , if he can secure helpers , he said			2
he 's been giving away about a grand daily since friday , he said			0
for example , his @entity15 page offered this clue tuesday with a photograph of @entity8 's waterfront and the @entity93 : " new drop : come for the cash , stay for the views			1
" the @ @entity97 even taunted his followers -- which had grown to 70,000 by tuesday afternoon -- by stating : " surprising with almost 70k followers , but the $ $ $ i just left the water is still there 15 + minutes later			2
and that was an easy one ! " @entity104 , a @entity8 college student , was the lucky hunter who found the $ 100 bill in an envelope			1
@entity104 posted a photograph of himself and the folded $ 100 bill , joined by @entity52 correspondent @entity109 , who found @entity104 just after @entity104 found the @entity111			1
@entity104 learned of the clue after his phone alerted him about a new tweet posted by @entity16			1
@entity104 rolled out of bed and dashed to the waterfront			0
there , he found the ka - ching in an envelope taped to a tourist information box			2
" i think it 's awesome , " @entity104 said			0
" it 's a totally fun thing to do , and the fact that he 's doing it in a philanthropic and charitable mindset makes it even cooler			0
" @entity104 said he would buy climbing shoes with the money			0
on wednesday , @entity52 affiliate @entity127 in @entity10 aired one search live on its morning program based on @ @entity97 tweeting this clue : " first ever @entity10 drop : across from where these sea creatures play , a dog pees in the fall			1
" the hint displayed a photo of a yellow fire hydrant			0
the station showed @entity140 of @entity10 running down the street , searching and then finding an envelope of $ 135 cash that was taped to the hydrant near the @entity145 , home of the @entity147 's @entity146			1
" i knew it was going to be right here , " @entity140 said , adding he will use the money to take his wife to dinner and to see his son 's semi-final baseball game			0
the anonymous donor is emotionally moved by the words and photos that successful searchers post on @entity15 , he said			1
" there 's absolutely no political agenda ; there 's no religious agenda ; there 's no business agenda , " the man said of his unconventional philanthropy			2
" the whole agenda is random acts of kindness and pay it forward and to put a smile on people 's face			1
" when i see people retweet the photos and say , ' i could have really used this money ' or ' my autistic stepson found it ' or ' we shared it with people that were with us at the beach ' or ' i bought lunch for my coworkers ' or ' just giving it charities , ' there 's a lot of heartwarming stories for people , " he said			0
the anonymous man plans to continue the cash giveaways for the indefinite future			1
money is no object for him			0
it 's only the time it takes to set up the hunts			0
" i 'm running around leaving money in different places , and there 's only one me , " he said , adding that a friend is helping			0
he would like other wealthy people across the country to follow his lead : " i 'd like for this to become a movement , " establishing a chain reaction of charitable giving			2
" if you can give back , it 's at least as rewarding as making good investments and getting big checks and making a lot of money			0
" he urges people not to look to him -- or lotteries -- as a godsend			0
there are plenty of job and business opportunities if people look hard enough , he asserted			0
" i want to say to the people that are struggling , please realize it 's a game			0
it 's pay it forward			1
do n't look to this or to the lottery to be your financial salvation , " he said			0
still , solicitations flood his inbox : he 's now overwhelmed by e-mails ( his address is on the @entity15 page ) from people seeking money for a down payment , mortgage payment , child 's college tuition or even dental work			1
" that 's more than i really bargained for , " the man said			2
still , he has no plans to stop the small - treasure hunts			2
" i 'm having a great time , " he declared			0
the only people who have figured out his identity are his friends , who identified his voice from his audio - only interviews with northern @entity6 broadcast outlets			1
@entity259 roomies return $ 41,000 found in thrift - store couch for @entity259 lottery winner , $ 1 million was blowing in the wind			1
