-- @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 will forever be remembered in football fans ' consciousness for helping @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 win the @entity9			0
that trio symbolized the idea that international football -- pitting the game 's very best players against one another -- was the pinnacle of a footballer 's career			0
but that passion for international football has cooled , especially for young @entity22 players , according to @entity9 winner @entity23			1
" i do n't feel like in @entity27 , the young players are dreaming of playing for the national team anymore , " said @entity23 , who is now @entity25 's @entity24			1
" i think it 's maybe the lack of @entity27 's @entity34 power , i would say , " added @entity23 , who won the @entity9 with @entity29 in 1998 as well as @entity30			1
" maybe this is as well a lack of love for the national team			2
" in @entity27 , i really do n't understand how come so many young players from the age of 16 - 21 pull out of the national team for injury			1
" when i grew up in @entity29 , i wanted to play for the @entity43 national team			1
that was my target , my dream			0
" @entity48 manager sir @entity47 has long argued that the @entity49 is the best competition in the world , surpassing even the @entity9 , but @entity23 insisted : " the national team is bigger than anything and i was really proud to play for @entity29			1
" the former @entity43 international argued a key part of his development as a player was linked to the time he spent with the @entity43 national team , in particular learning from the example of more experienced players such as @entity61 and @entity62 , the current les bleus coach			1
@entity23 questioned whether the lack of elder statesmen within the current @entity43 international set - up had contributed to the disciplinary problems that surfaced at the @entity9 in 2010 and more recently at @entity68			2
@entity25 midfielder @entity69 has not been recalled for @entity29 's upcoming friendly against @entity71 and @entity9 qualifier against @entity73 even after serving a three - match ban imposed by the @entity75			1
@entity69 swore at a reporter following @entity29 's @entity68 quarter - final defeat by @entity73 after previously telling another journalist to " shut your mouth ! " in their opening match against @entity27 when he had scored			2
" his non-selection is a surprise , " said @entity23 , who was speaking at the leaders in @entity84 in @entity85 on wednesday			0
" i 'm sure he will go back to the national team			2
" @entity27 expects @entity23 's view that young @entity22 players were somewhat ambivalent about playing for their country might give the @entity34 pause for thought			1
on tuesday the @entity34 opened its elite football facility -- the $ 168 - million @entity97 complex -- which it hopes can help pave the way for the national team to win a major international tournament for the first time since 1966			2
however , @entity23 urged patience for the positive effects of the @entity97 initiative to trickle down			0
" it does n't guarantee success and it might take 10 to 15 years , " said the former @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity25 midfielder			0
" the heart of the @entity22 player is double or triple that of the @entity114 or @entity43 player			0
that is a good base to start with			0
" city have their own ambitious plans for a new training academy , which @entity23 described as " unbelievable "			1
the project , which will boast 15 full - size and two half - size football pitches as well as accommodation for 40 youth - team players , will contain a 7,000 - capacity stadium for youth team matches , a separate building for the first team and a bridge linking the @entity130 to the area -- which will be known as the @entity132			0
" we want to bring our young players from the academy through to the first team , " said @entity23			1
" it 's important as the fans really identify with these players and this is the philosophy of the club			0
" but clubs like @entity25 , @entity48 and @entity149 will also always try and sign the exceptional player , " added @entity23 , when asked if the @entity142 champions were no longer interested in signing players such as @entity145 striker @entity144 , who is expected to leave the @entity114 club next summer			1
in deciding how their academy should be run , @entity25 traveled round the world to look at examples of other successful academies as well as how other sports develop young talented players			2
city particularly liked the way aspiring @entity160 players spent much of their day within an academy environment , which helps them " to learn how to behave as an individual " , said @entity23			0
@entity23 is an ambassador for @entity164 's new pass initiative , turning every pass in this season 's @entity166 into funding for one day 's education for young people around the world .			0

@entity27 's young players no longer " dream " of playing for their national team , says @entity29 @entity9 winner @entity23
@entity177 won the @entity9 in 1998 as well as @entity30
@entity25 's @entity24 described the plans for the club 's own new training academy as " unbelievable "
