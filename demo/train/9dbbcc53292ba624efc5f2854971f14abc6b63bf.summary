-- an oil pipeline that on september 9 began leaking crude oil just southwest of @entity5 , @entity6 , was back up and running friday morning , owner @entity1 announced			1
the line , @entity8 , runs from @entity9 , @entity10 , to @entity11 , @entity12 , and transports 670,000 barrels per day , according to @entity1			1
the company this summer has had to close three pipelines to investigate and / or make repairs			2
the first and largest was a rupture in line 6b that dumped more than 800,000 gallons into @entity21 's @entity20			1
the company also shut down a pipeline this monday after oil was detected near a construction site , but the company noted this incident did not appear to be a leak as the investigation stemmed from the discovery of less than a gallon of oil			1
spills spark spikes in gasoline prices large or small , pipeline incidents have been grabbing headlines , not to mention the eyes of politicians			1
and since there 's about 200,000 miles of liquid pipeline and 300,000 of gas lines , it 's an issue than can affect just about every part of the country			2
the recent liquid pipeline failures in combination with the deadly gas pipeline explosion and fire that killed four people in @entity51 , @entity52 , helped lead to a wednesday hearing of the @entity54 , where politicians voiced concerns over the industry 's regulatory standards			1
more questions surround @entity52 gas line " this is a very timely hearing , as we are unfortunately experiencing a high level of pipeline accidents that have caused significant death and destruction , " said rep. @entity61 , @entity62 , chair of the @entity64 on railroads , pipelines , and @entity67			1
" our subcommittee ... has found significant problems with reporting and inspections , " she said			2
@entity1 has taken significant heat over the notion that it waited too long to report the incident			1
" the spill likely occurred sometime the day before @entity1 reported it to the @entity86 , " said rep. @entity81 , @entity82 , chair of the committee			1
he noted that in a hearing prior to the spill in @entity21 , @entity1 's vice president of @entity90 operations touted his company 's ability to detect problems in the pipes			1
@entity81 cited @entity97 's quote from the previous hearing : " our response time from our control center can be almost instantaneous , and our large leaks are typically detected by our control center personnel			2
" the pipe ruptured 10 days after he made that statement			0
" @entity1 knew about hundreds of defects in the line , " @entity81 added , " and we know that @entity108 [ the @entity108 ] was made aware of them and failed to do anything to address @entity1 's inaction			1
that is not a culture of safety			0
" @entity114 , who testified at the hearing , wept as she described how she and her two daughters had been exposed to benzene , a volatile carcinogen , after the spill			1
" my 12 - year - old asks me frequently , ' am i going to get cancer ? ' " said @entity120 during her testimony			1
" the only way i can answer that is ' i do n't know			0
the only thing we can do is pray that everything will be ok			0
' " residents near spill urged to evacuate in his prepared testimony , @entity1 president and ceo @entity131 said he was " deeply concerned " by the @entity21 incident and that " for @entity1 , no spill is acceptable			1
" the @entity136 reported this week that the pipe that broke in @entity21 had been marked for defects three times in the past five years but that , since those defects were declared to be minor , no repairs were required under current federal regulations			1
so , would more stringent rules make things any better ? perhaps , said leading industry analyst @entity145 , but he said care should be taken not to enact rules simply as a means of punishment			0
" we just want to be sure that those improvements are effective			0
we do n't just want regulation for the sake of regulation , " he said			0
@entity154 said he feels gas pipelines need the most overhaul , for a combination of reasons			0
part of it , he said , is because gas can do so much damage when it ignites			0
" the gas guys have got to really come to the table and start saying , ' we 've got an issue here			0
we 've got to have more rational regulation			0
' " nonetheless , the majority of the hearing this week centered on liquid pipelines , which , @entity145 said , can certainly use " incremental " changes			2
he said he would see it as " overkill " to force companies to repair every problem			0
" you ca n't eliminate all anomalies in a pipeline , " he added			2
the question is , does the operator have that corrosion under control so the pipeline does n't go to failure ? " @entity145 also added that while it may seem like the companies should be able to more quickly identify an issue , it 's not always so cut and dry			2
" i 've been in the control room operating this stuff			0
it 's hard to find major releases , even ruptures , by pressure loss			0
there 's so much information coming into these control rooms , so it is n't as easy as the public thinks it is			0
" he then added that he is by no means defending @entity1 over its response time in the @entity21 spill			1
he concluded by saying the industry has taken a " quantum leap " forward over the years but " it needs to continually progress because obviously we 're getting these ruptures and it 's not good			0
" " something is not right here			0
" the @entity64 on railroads , pipelines , and hazardous materials is scheduled to hold a hearing on the @entity218 's inspection and enforcement of gas and hazardous liquid pipelines -- @entity0 's @entity222 and @entity224 's @entity223 contributed to this report			2
