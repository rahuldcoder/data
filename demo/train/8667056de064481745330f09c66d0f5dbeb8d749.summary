@entity1 's first female engineer , @entity0 , has made a career out of bucking expectations -- and she did so once again on monday by announcing she will leave @entity1 to be the new ceo of @entity5 , the struggling company that once was @entity1 's main competitor			1
know @entity5 's @entity8 in 11 facts the tech world reacted with shock to the news			1
but it 's perhaps time everyone got used to the idea that @entity16 , who was @entity1 's 20th employee and who is credited with the success of many of its most famous products , is n't the kind of person who does only what people expect her to do			1
" there is such a stereotype of the hacker -- the pasty - skinned guy with the thick glasses , the pocket protector , the blue glow coming off of the monitor ... people think if they 're going to be good at this , that 's what they need to be , " @entity16 told @entity26 in an interview earlier this year			1
" you can be good at technology and like fashion and art. you can be good at technology and be a jock			0
you can be good at technology and be a mom			0
you can do it your way , on your terms			0
" @entity16 , sometimes referred to as the " @entity50 , " certainly has charted her own course , often weaving seemingly disparate worlds and interests together			2
raised in @entity55 , @entity56 , the 37 - year - old joined @entity1 in 1999 when it was a fledgling start - up , not an internet titan			2
she danced in " @entity63 " ballet at @entity62 and earned a degree in computer science			0
she espouses a love for cupcakes -- but , according to interviews with other news organizations , once created a spreadsheet to determine the perfect recipe			0
at @entity1 , @entity16 was responsible for overseeing the launch of some of the company 's most iconic products , including @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			1
@entity79 : new @entity5 ceo @entity16 is pregnant but it was her keen design aesthetic that in part led to her success at @entity1 , which she helped grow into one of the biggest tech and @entity89 companies on the planet			1
@entity16 's most enduring legacy at @entity1 may prove to be the company 's search engine homepage , with its minimalist feel , ample white space and bright blue , red , yellow and green colors			1
she is credited with pushing for that clean , approachable look -- which seems to be a reflection of her style outside the office , too			2
" an engineer at heart , she also had something that many of her peers did not during @entity1 's early days : a keen sense of style and design , " the @entity105 wrote in a 2009 profile			1
" she adored bold blocks of color against a white background , much like the @entity119 prints that once hung in her childhood home			0
... her @entity123 penthouse has a similar , but more expensive , aesthetic			0
it is painted in neutral shades and decorated with fanciful , multihued glass artwork by @entity128			0
" open letter to @entity0 @entity16 told the paper that people who come to her penthouse sometimes are confused , saying : " does your apartment look like @entity1 or does @entity1 look like your apartment ? ' " along with executive chairman @entity138 , @entity16 has been one of @entity1 's most visible public faces for the past decade			1
a frequent speaker at tech conferences , she has lent a dash of glamour to the jeans - and - hoodie world of many young tech engineers			0
as one of a relatively small number of women in high - ranking positions in tech -- @entity154 coo @entity153 and @entity156 ceo @entity155 are two others -- @entity16 often is asked about what she thinks about the role of women in her field			1
" i actually think it 's the wrong question , " she told @entity162 / @entity163 in an interview in may			2
" it 's a question that hangs us up and causes the progress to be slower			2
the truth is we 're not producing enough computer scientists , period			0
" @entity172 , she says , is what really matters			0
@entity175 leaves work at 5:30 to spend time with her kids " i 'm not a woman at @entity1 , i 'm a geek at @entity1 , " she told @entity26 in april			2
" if you can find something that you 're really passionate about , whether you 're a man or a woman comes a lot less into play			0
@entity172 is a gender - neutralizing force			0
" @entity16 will need plenty of passion if she is to help right the ship at @entity5 , a struggling company that has seen its recent ceos pass through the company in quick succession			1
many think she is the right person for that job			0
" @entity0 is one of a few people who has enough gravitas to ignore public markets for a while and do what 's long - term best for @entity5 , " @entity196 , a prominent @entity198 investor , wrote on @entity199 shortly after the news was announced			1
@entity206 , another prominent venture capitalist , reportedly praised the move , saying @entity16 will be a product - minded ceo			1
@entity208 said the @entity5 job puts @entity16 " in the running for the title of the most powerful woman in tech. " and the blog @entity214 said she is " just what @entity5 needs			1
" " this is a great move for @entity5 , which has stewed in mediocrity for years , " wrote @entity214 's @entity218			2
" @entity16 , a big shot in @entity198 and a perfectionist product - type executive , could legitimately make @entity5 respectable again			1
at the very least , she will command attention			0
" interactive : 10 most powerful women in tech do you think there is a double standard for women in positions of power ? sound off on @entity234 .			0
