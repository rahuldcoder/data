-- after six months , 35 pounds of chicken breast and more than a hundred hours of exercising , @entity1 finally sees the fruits of his labor			1
there are six of them			0
the left image shows @entity1 in january			1
the right one shows him six months after exercising and dieting			2
@entity1 , an @entity12 contributor who lives in @entity14 , @entity15 , revamped his lifestyle to get six - pack abs in six months			1
before , @entity1 never exercised and frequently gorged on processed and junk food			1
although he was already skinny , @entity1 wanted to get a more chiseled figure for his 10 - year high school reunion and his blog called @entity22 , where he comments on current events while standing shirtless			1
since january , @entity24 has followed the progress of three @entity12 contributors , including @entity1 , as they strive to meet their diet and fitness goals			1
during the last six months , @entity1 jogged , lifted weights and exercised his core			1
he gave up his favorite @entity31 , chocolate bars and cookies in favor of zucchini , chicken breasts and 16 egg whites a day			2
he gave up his @entity38 for water			2
" it has really become a way of life , " @entity1 said			1
" i 've seen such good results			0
i feel so much better , seen such positive results			0
there 's no way i can go back to junk food and not working out			1
it 's been a life - changing experience			2
" see @entity51 's @entity12 submission			1
detractors called his goal shallow and told him to wear a shirt , but @entity1 was not easily discouraged			1
" if your friends say negative comments , do n't pay attention , " he said			2
" a lot of people are n't motivated to do this			2
it 's not that they do n't want you to succeed , but it 's just they do n't have the motivation to do it themselves			2
sometimes friends unintentionally put negativity out there			0
listen to your internal self and know not to give up			0
" @entity1 's new abs have landed him a spot on the @entity75 , where he will ride a convertible ( and show off his six - pack ) on sunday			1
his car is to be accompanied by rows of shirtless men			0
but exercise physiologist @entity81 , of the @entity82 , showed concern when he saw @entity1 's before - and - after photo			1
while @entity81 neither met nor examined @entity1 , and viewed him only through photographs , he noted that @entity1 looked a bit " emaciated			1
" @entity1 says he has lost 3 pounds			2
people with too little body fat could be considered unhealthy , @entity81 said			0
he recommended that men have 7 to 8 percent body fat and that women have 12 to 14 percent			0
" a six - pack should be the result of a consistent exercise program and a nutritious , well - balanced eating strategy , not the sole purpose of a training program and crash diet , " he said			1
many mistake six - pack abs as a symbol for fitness			1
" having big , defined muscles does n't necessarily mean it 's a harbinger of good health or mean they 're strong , " @entity81 said			1
" it 's purely aesthetics			0
" when a client talks about getting a six - pack , @entity81 would ask , " how does that change your life ? how does having defined abs make your life better ? are you stronger or more efficient at something ? " @entity1 said the ab regimen helped him adopt a healthier diet , going from zero servings of fruits and vegetables to five a day			1
" now i crave fresh fruit and vegetables , " @entity1 said			2
" i will crave zucchini like a snack			0
i 'll cut it up then steam it			0
i 've been having peaches , apricots and plums			0
plums are my new best friend			0
" once a person has achieved a six - pack , he or she has to maintain the physique through routine daily exercise , @entity81 said			1
for people who are trying to get healthier , @entity81 recommended taking on performance - based goals rather than aesthetic ones			2
dancers and athletes have the best - toned bodies , " because they train for dance or sports , " he said			0
" basically , form follows function , " he said			0
" if you put your aesthetic appearance first , you 're trying to train for the mirror			0
you 're never 100 percent happy with what you see			0
you always notice a flaw			0
" @entity81 suggested forming goals such as being able to run a certain distance or doing a number of pull - ups or push - ups to shift the focus from appearances to fitness			0
" i feel 100 percent comfortable with my body , " @entity1 said			1
" this is the best @entity162 's resolution i ever had in my entire life			0
