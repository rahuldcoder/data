-- the president of world soccer 's governing body is used to being admonished			0
but it is n't often the manager of arguably the biggest club on the planet is tearing a strip off @entity9			2
@entity11 boss @entity10 felt moved to tell @entity9 to button it after the @entity13 insisted @entity16 goalkeeper @entity15 should be crowned footballer of the year			1
that affronted @entity10 , who thinks his star player -- @entity19 -- is a shoo - in for a second successive @entity21 award			1
the @entity22 fired a record 17 goals in the @entity25 last season as @entity11 won its 10th crown and @entity10 is in no doubt the award should be his			1
" it has surprised me what the @entity31 president has said and it appears he is unable to keep his mouth shut , " @entity10 told a press conference on tuesday			1
" the @entity21 is something that gets talked about months before yet this year there are not that many things to think about			0
" last year @entity19 had other players like @entity38 and @entity39 contesting it but this year , with the titles he has won and the goals he has scored , there 's no doubt he is going to win it			1
" therefore , @entity9 's words do n't make any sense			0
" on a visit to 2018 @entity50 host @entity51 , @entity9 suggested @entity15 should be handed the gong after a string of exceptional performances for @entity16 on its way to a @entity50 triumph in @entity57			1
@entity31 's president had also suggested the @entity60 stopper should have been handed the @entity21 award -- given to the @entity50 's best player -- rather than @entity63 striker @entity38			1
@entity38 , a four - time winner of the @entity21 is again on the list , with other luminaries , but , perhaps surprisingly , not @entity63 's newest striker , @entity66			0
@entity66 scored 31 goals for @entity69 club @entity68 last season as it came agonizingly close to a first top flight title since 1990			0
the @entity73 also starred for his country at the @entity75 , before he was banned from all football for four months for biting @entity78 defender @entity77			0
the award is voted for by coaches and captains of national teams and journalists across the world selected by @entity85 , and will be awarded in @entity86 , @entity13 , on january 12			0
@entity10 , who also claimed the @entity87 in his first season at the helm in @entity11 , has been nominated for the @entity91 prize			2
and though he joked he might be out of the running to win it after his harsh words for @entity9 , @entity10 did say he was pleased to have been selected			2
" i am proud to be in this category and would like to win it , although i have already received the biggest prize when we claimed the @entity25 , " he said			2
" if i win another one i 'll have to expand my trophy cabinet			0

@entity11 manager says @entity31 president @entity9 " unable to keep mouth shut "
