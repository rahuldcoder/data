-- it is another chance for @entity2 to stare down the curse of @entity4			1
seven times they have been @entity7 finalists since their former manager laid down his hex in 1962 , and seven times they have lost			0
refused a pay rise after leading @entity2 to a second successive @entity15 triumph , the @entity12 @entity11 declared the club would not succeed on the continent for 100 years			1
it has held firm ever since , but perhaps on may 14 , the spell will finally be laid to rest			0
@entity2 's modern stars battled and scrapped their way to a 0 - 0 draw at @entity24 to book a @entity26 final at the same venue next month with @entity29 side @entity28 , who held off a valiant fightback from @entity32			1
perhaps it is @entity24 who will now feel cursed			2
the @entity24 were supposed to book a @entity7 coronation at their own footballing fortress , and while they remain unbeaten there all season that will come as little consolation			0
trailing 2 - 1 from the first leg in @entity42 , the best chance of a tight first half fell to @entity45 , whose back post header was looping into the net before an intervention from @entity2 center - back @entity49			1
@entity24 piled on the pressure in the second half , veteran midfielder @entity54 forcing @entity2 goalkeeper @entity55 into a fine save			1
the @entity24 's task got a tad easier with a little over 20 minutes to go when @entity58 picked up a second yellow card in the space of six minutes and was dismissed			0
two more red cards were shown , to unused @entity24 substitute @entity62 and @entity2 's @entity63 , who had not long been replaced , as tempers flared on the bench			1
@entity24 continued to pile forward but @entity2 held on , @entity55 denying former @entity67 striker @entity66 , while @entity68 had a goal rightly ruled out for offside			1
after seven long minutes of injury time the final whistle sounded and @entity2 booked their final berth for a second successive season			2
the @entity4 curse reared its head again in 2013 when they lost the final to a header from @entity80 's @entity79 with practically the last touch of the match			2
that heartbreak was added to a long list of losing finals in 1963 , 1965 , 1968 , 1983 , 1988 and 1990			0
but on may 14 , it can be laid to rest once and for all			0
@entity28 will have plenty to say about that though , after they booked their place in a nerve shredding encounter with @entity92 cousins @entity32			1
@entity32 wiped out their 2 - 0 deficit from the first leg inside 25 minutes at the famous @entity95			1
@entity97 's slaloming run ended with a powerful shot that deflected past @entity28 goalkeeper @entity99 and into the net with just 14 minutes on the clock			0
less than 10 minutes later , @entity103 ' bullet header from a left wing cross hit the bar but bounced in off the unfortunate @entity99			0
stung into action , @entity28 hit back , former @entity108 striker @entity107 forcing @entity32 goalkeeper @entity109 into a point blank save when it looked easier to score			2
@entity32 maintained the same high - pitched pace of attack in the second half and got their reward with 20 minutes to go as defender @entity116 stabbed a corner into the roof of the net			2
but with seconds remaining , @entity123 -- on loan from @entity122 second tier club @entity121 -- nodded home to spark wild scenes of celebration			0
@entity28 won successive titles in the @entity26 , the forerunner of the @entity26 , in 2006 and 2007 and only got their place in this year 's competition after @entity132 and @entity133 were forbidden from taking part			1
it is now their task to ensure the curse of @entity4 lives on .			0

@entity2 draw 0 - 0 at @entity24 to seal a place in the @entity26 final
@entity143 side get another chance to break the curse of @entity4
former manager cursed the club after being refused a pay rise in 1962
@entity2 will play @entity28 after they defeated fellow @entity29 side @entity32
