-- a crowd plunders buildings crumbled by last week 's earthquake , hauling off water , food , candles and anything else recoverable			0
suddenly , a pickup truck hauling a half dozen armed policemen squeals to a halt			0
the mob scatters as the police officers in military style camouflage fire shots in the air and apprehend a few stragglers , some with a kick or a punch			1
such scenes occurred with increased frequency monday in @entity21 , the devastated @entity22 capital , as frustrated survivors resorted to scrounging and looting due to a lack of relief aid			1
the rising tension raised questions about the ability of the @entity29 to maintain order and its tactics in doing so			2
while the @entity33 is sending thousands of troops to assist in relief efforts , @entity33 officials say the @entity22 police are responsible for security on the streets , with backing from @entity40 peacekeepers			1
" the first line of law and order here is , number one , the @entity22 police , number two , the @entity40 forces , " @entity33 ambassador @entity41 said monday			1
" the @entity33 forces are standing by to provide security as needed			1
" that seems to be an overwhelming task for the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) , a force of about 9,000 that is the impoverished @entity54 nation 's lone security apparatus			2
latest updates full coverage national police chief @entity57 told @entity0 monday that the department has been severely affected by the earthquake , with thousands of officers injured , killed or unaccounted for			1
the @entity21 force of 4,000 has dropped to about 1,500 , he said			0
complicating matters even further , roughly another 4,000 " bad guys " are on the run , @entity57 added , after the 95 - year - old , badly overcrowded @entity64 in the capital collapsed and the inmates escaped			0

" @entity75 , the former @entity33 president who is the @entity40 special envoy to @entity22 , said sunday that 40 percent of the @entity22 police force has reported for duty since the january 12 temblor			1
it was unclear how many other police officers died and how many were struggling with the overwhelming hardships from such widespread destruction			2
first formed in 1995 , the civilian police force took over security from a disbanded military known for loyalty to dictators instead of the state , noted @entity89 , director of the non-profit @entity90 in @entity22			1
a lack of money and other resources over the years , along with continued instability including a 2004 coup , has left the police force under - funded , under - trained and full of former soldiers prone to operating outside the law , @entity89 said			2
for example , he cited summary executions of suspected criminals as a problem since the 2004 coup , along with police involvement in gangs or other criminal activity			2
in addition , a dysfunctional judicial system undermines the ability of the police force to deal with chronic crime problems in @entity21 and elsewhere , according to @entity89			0
high - resolution photos of damage @entity113 map progress has occurred in recent years , as the government simultaneously tried to remove " bad apples " from the police force while expanding the number of policemen on the streets , @entity89 said			0
" although the @entity29 's efforts resulted in significantly increased levels of physical security and policing effectiveness , in many cases the @entity29 could not prevent or respond to gang - related and other societal violence due to an insufficient number of officers and inadequate equipment or training , " said a 2008 report on @entity22 by @entity89 's group			1
now the earthquake will set back the reform effort			0

according to @entity141 , the additional forces would " help humanitarian assistance be delivered in a safe way			0
" @entity89 said @entity22 coping with the disaster will be patient as long as they see aid arriving			2
he worried that excessive concerns about security was slowing the aid			0
" i am afraid you 're going to have an escalating spiral where people who were willing to be patient lose their patience due to supplies being withheld for security reasons , " @entity89 said			0
" and then that impatience escalates and brings increased security , which further cuts the flow of supplies			0
