-- when i was a youth pastor at a small , evangelical church in @entity3 , @entity4 , i used to accompany my pastor and other members of our congregation into some of the city 's neighborhoods where gang activity and gun violence were most prevalent			1
we would stand on the corner next to the drug dealers and talk to them about why it was important to turn their lives around			2
all gave us respect , even if they did n't agree with what we had to say			2
and i believe they did so because we respected them			2
we did n't call them names or discount how they felt			2
we met them where they were -- literally and figuratively			2
in a lot of ways , hearing @entity29 talk about social issues , particularly gay rights , reminds me of those days			1
like those drug dealers , i 'm sure he ca n't see how he destroys his community			0
like those drug dealers , @entity29 is probably doing what he thinks he needs to do			1
and like those drug dealers , what @entity29 is pushing is addictive , poisonous and a trigger to violence we see all around us			1
his anti-gay rhetoric justifies , for some people , the bullying in school , the senseless beatings of people perceived to be gay and the under - reported murders of transgender people			1
the truth is that the disrespectful tone in which @entity29 talks about @entity53 people , in the name of religion , gives permission for our lives to be equally disrespected			1
sometimes , the impulse is to return the fire , matching name - calling with name - calling			0
i , too , have found myself so ticked off by @entity29 's words that i 've called him everything but a child of @entity67			1
that 's when i come to my senses and try to remember the one thing he seems to forget			1
we 're all @entity67 's children			1
we 're all brothers and sisters			0
and like brothers and sisters , we wo n't always agree			0
but we ca n't get so caught up in our disagreements that we forget that what bonds us is far more important than what divides us			0
being respectful does n't mean you have to give up your religion			0
opinion : to @entity29 : here 's how to support a gay child still , as much as it pains me to admit , @entity29 is my brother			1
i do n't support the way he sows seeds of discord for political gain , but i ca n't allow him to drag me down so far that i hate him			1
just as i did n't hate the drug dealers and gang bangers who were poisoning the @entity3 neighborhoods			2
instead we all must go to the figurative street corner and find a way to respectfully engage			2
after all , @entity29 's views are not just his			1
more than 30,000 @entity96 last week said they wanted to see him in the @entity97			0
this week thousands in @entity98 might say the same			0
calling social conservatives names might help blow off steam , but it 's not going to change their hearts			2
and you can not change a person 's mind without first changing his or her heart			2
but neither group is going anywhere without at least getting to the place of respect			0
now i 'm sure some are surprised to learn that i was heavily involved in the evangelical church			0
others are shocked to read i lived in a small town called @entity3			0
but we are all more than we appear to be			0
@entity29 is more than his homophobic rhetoric			1
i am more than a gay guy who opposes it			0
and if we were to sit across from each other with a cup of coffee , i 'm sure we would find the labels we assign to constituent groups and such would n't do any of us justice			0
sound touchy feely ? it is			0
but that does n't mean it is n't true			0
@entity29 's significance has nothing to do with the election -- it 's that he gives voice and seeming legitimacy to a lot of people who think it 's ok to fire someone for being gay			1
getting upset by such a notion is natural			0
slapping them with a name like bigot is understandable			0
but then what ? @entity29 's campaign presents us with the uncomfortable but necessary task of dealing with that question			1
@entity29 said he would love his son just the same if his son were to tell him he was gay			1
whether that 's true is debatable , but what is n't debatable is the importance for fair minded people to push for a country where , if @entity29 's son were gay , he would n't feel society hates him for it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			1

@entity163 : @entity29 's anti-gay rhetoric helps *create* *climate* of hate
he says rhetoric justifies , for some people , acting out against gays
@entity163 gets angry , but knows @entity29 is more than just his rhetoric
@entity163 : we have to engage with the views of those we disagree with
