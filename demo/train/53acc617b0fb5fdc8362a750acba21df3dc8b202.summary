-- doctors treating @entity4 , who drowned her five children in a bathtub in 2001 , will ask that she be allowed to leave her mental hospital for two hours each week to attend church , her attorney said thursday			1
" it is a recommendation of the doctors that she be permitted to attend , and of course she wants to , " attorney @entity9 said			2
" it would be both beneficial and mentally therapeutic for her			0
she has been accepted into a congregation			0
it is simply a baby step in the right direction toward acclimation into a community down the road of sorts			1
" @entity4 ' doctors at @entity26 , in @entity27 , @entity28 , will make the request of the trial judge " in the next week or two , " @entity9 said			1
" i am all for it , but of course it is the judge 's decision and we all recognize it , " he said			0
now 47 , @entity4 " has not been seen or been a part of any portion of society for the last 11 years , " @entity9 said thursday			1
during her first trial in 2002 , jurors heard taped interviews in which @entity4 said that she thought @entity44 was sending her messages and that she was sending her children -- @entity47 , 7 ; @entity48 , 5 ; @entity49 , 3 ; @entity50 , 2 ; and @entity51 , 6 months -- to heaven and sparing them from hell when she killed them on june 20 , 2001			1
several medical experts testified that she suffered from schizophrenia , depression and other medical conditions			0
@entity9 argued @entity4 was suffering from a " full - blown psychosis			1
" " if this woman does n't meet the test of insanity in this state , then nobody does , " @entity9 told the jury			2
" we might as well wipe it from the books			0
" but jurors rejected her insanity defense and sentenced her to life in prison for the deaths of three of the children			2
a state appeals court overturned the conviction because an expert witness for the state , a psychiatrist , testified erroneously that the television series " @entity85 " had aired an episode about a woman suffering from post-partum depression who drowned her children			1
in 2006 , a second jury found @entity4 not guilty by reason of insanity , meaning she was committed to a state mental facility			1
