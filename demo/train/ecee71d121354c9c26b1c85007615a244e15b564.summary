-- who can ever forget the electrifying series of presidential debates in which @entity7 , outlining his @entity5 program , went head - to - head in 1964 with @entity10 nominee @entity9 , who boldly stood his ground on rock - solid , small - government ideals ? or the 1968 debates that @entity13 could n't take its eyes off : @entity15 , trying once again to make it to the @entity18 , toe to toe with vice president @entity20 in what was shaping up to be a close election with starkly different platforms			1
the 1972 presidential debates , of course -- @entity15 , who was by then the incumbent , trading verbal body slams with his @entity28 challenger , @entity27 , against the backdrop of the @entity30 -- were like a professional wrestling grudge match , with each excited camp of viewers at home pulling for its man to triumph			1
what ? you say you do n't remember those debates ? you 're right			2
it 's an intriguing footnote to modern political history			2
televised presidential debates -- the first one of this year 's general election will be held in @entity44 , @entity45 on wednesday -- have become so much a part of the fabric of autumn campaigns that many people assume that the famed @entity50 - @entity15 debates of 1960 began an uninterrupted string			1
but in fact , after the four @entity54 debates , it would be 16 years before there was another debate between a @entity10 and @entity28 candidate			2
@entity59 : why debates do n't always make a difference @entity50 - @entity15 , for a long stretch , was the anomaly -- the exception to the rule			1
before their debates , no presidential candidates in a general election had debated on radio or television			1
there had been intraparty , primary - season debates but never one after the end of the summer conventions			0
it is part of political lore that , because of @entity15 's pale , perspiring look in the first of those 1960 debates , he suffered in comparison with the tan , confident @entity50 , and the tv cameras did him in			1
key to the shorthand narrative is that @entity15 , not fully understanding the relatively new medium of television , declined to wear makeup			1
but there 's more to the story than that			0
largely forgotten is that @entity15 had been hospitalized for two weeks in august , when he had hoped to be out campaigning			1
he had banged his knee getting out of a car at an event in @entity96 and had developed a serious infection			0
so , while @entity50 was introducing himself to voters around the country , @entity15 was in a hospital bed -- and the newsreel footage of him , in his pajamas , being visited by president @entity103 did not play well against film of the healthy - looking , vibrant @entity50 working election - season crowds			1
by the time @entity15 left the hospital , he was in a weakened state			1
he had the flu and a fever when he arrived in @entity110 for that first debate , and had lost considerable weight			0
he allowed his assistants to apply a drugstore - aisle product called @entity115 to tone down his 5 o'clock shadow , but his ashen appearance , and the perspiration , were as much a consequence of his health problems as anything else			0
he lost , and in 1964 , with @entity9 as the @entity10 candidate , president @entity7 , who had taken office after the assassination of @entity50 , decided that there was no reason for him to debate			2
@entity7 was well ahead in the polls ; he was said to feel that a debate could not help him much but could certainly hurt him , if he did not do well			2
he sent word that he was not open to participating			0
@entity130 : how @entity131 can win debate there was another factor arguing against presidential debates in the 16 years after @entity54 : the @entity137 's equal - time provision , which mandated the inclusion of all candidates -- fringe ones as well as the nominees of the major parties			1
( it had been suspended for a year in 1960 , when @entity50 and @entity15 debated )			1
so the major candidates could use that as an out , if they preferred not to debate			0
in 1968 @entity20 wanted to debate @entity15 , but @entity15 -- still stung by 1960 -- said no. and in 1972 , when @entity15 was the incumbent and far ahead in the polls , he barely deigned to say @entity27 's name during the fall campaign , much less debate him			1
by 1976 a way around the equal - time rule was found : if debates were sponsored not by television networks but by outside groups setting their own criteria , they could be considered news events and thus not required to include minor - party candidates			1
that year , president @entity158 , having entered office after @entity15 resigned , agreed to debate @entity160			2
he may have wished he had n't			0
it was in one of the debates that @entity158 said , " there is no @entity166 domination of @entity167 , " a misstep that changed the course of the election			0
today debates between the candidates -- even when one of them is the incumbent -- are all but mandatory			1
a candidate would be seen as chicken for not agreeing to debate			0
( if you thought the @entity178 empty chair at the @entity179 this summer caused conversation , just think what a candidate who agreed to debate would have to say about the empty chair of an opponent who declined )			0
even post- 1976 , some candidates tested the waters of skipping debates			1
in 1980 , president @entity160 chose not to participate in the first one because independent candidate @entity189 was included			0
@entity160 's opponent , @entity190 , did show up at that debate -- and even though @entity160 appeared at the one subsequent debate that fall , @entity190 went on to win the election			2
four years ago , @entity10 candidate @entity194 said that he wanted to postpone the first debate in @entity196 , @entity197 ; he proposed that he and his opponent , fellow @entity13 senator @entity131 , instead go to @entity199 to help with the financial crisis			0
@entity131 said he would be in @entity197 regardless of whether @entity194 was ( " it 's going to be part of the president 's job to be able to deal with more than one thing at once " )			0
@entity194 relented and came to the debate , but his initial hesitation seemed to throw his campaign off balance			0
it 's unlikely that there will ever be another autumn in which the candidates do not debate , but you never know			2
it 's a pretty safe bet , though , that come nightfall wednesday in @entity45 , @entity131 and @entity218 will be at their appointed places on the stage			0
it 's how we do things now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			2

@entity227 : after @entity230 in 1960 , there were no presidential debates until 1976
he says @entity15 's *sweaty* showing in ' 60 helped put candidates off tv debates
in subsequent campaigns , neither @entity7 nor @entity15 debated their rivals
@entity227 : now debates are nearly mandatory , much as candidates might like to avoid them
