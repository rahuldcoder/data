a sign you 'd expect to see in a war zone , hanging at a police station			2
two unarmed civilians shot more than 20 times after a high - speed chase			2
a man in the middle of a medical emergency , jolted with a taser while strapped to a gurney			0
these are alarming examples , federal investigators say , that show police in @entity17 have been using unnecessary and unreasonable force at a " significant rate , " employing " dangerous tactics " that put the community at risk			1
a report released thursday details a nearly two - year @entity25 investigation which found that @entity17 police use guns , @entity27 , pepper spray and their fists excessively , unnecessarily or in retaliation			1
officers also have used excessive force on those " who are mentally ill or in crisis , " the @entity25 said			1
now a federal court will keep tabs on the @entity17 police as part of a legal agreement going forward			1
the @entity25 's investigation started in 2013 , after several incidents , including a controversial case the previous year when more than 100 officers were involved in a high - speed chase that ended with the deaths of two unarmed civilians			1
here 's a look at that case , and several others examples federal investigators pointed out in their report : a chase gone awry : police began chasing @entity51 and passenger @entity52 after officers and witnesses thought they heard a gunshot coming from their car as they drove by a court building			1
but it turns out , they did n't have weapons			0
the @entity25 's report said it now appears that what they heard was the car backfiring			2
more than 100 officers participated in the high - speed chase			2
after a 25 - minute chase that reached speeds of more than 100 mph and ended in a school parking lot , 13 officers fired 137 rounds hitting @entity51 and @entity52 more than 20 times each , the report said			1
" the officers , who were firing on the car from all sides , reported believing that they were being fired at by the suspects			2
it now appears that those shots were being fired by fellow officers , " the @entity25 wrote			2
both @entity52 and @entity51 were killed			0
suspect kicked in the head : video from a police helicopter captured officers arresting a man after a january 2011 police chase			2
after the suspect was handcuffed and lying on the ground , officers used excessive force by kicking him in the head numerous times , the report said			1
many officers were there , but none identified any fellow officers who had exacted excessive force on the suspect , and no officer was disciplined , the @entity25 said			2
accountability , or the lack thereof , was a theme of the @entity25 report			0
of the period reviewed , 2010 - 2013 , the investigation found that officers were suspended on only six occasions for improper use of force			1
" discipline is so rare that no more than 51 officers out of a sworn force of 1,500 were disciplined in any fashion in connection with a use of force incident over a three - and - a half - year period , " the report said			1
taser used inside ambulance : officers were flagged down to help a man lying on a sidewalk having seizures			0
when paramedics arrived , they helped him into an ambulance , where he was strapped onto a gurney			0
that 's when the man , who the @entity25 reports identifies as " @entity130 , " got angry , threatening the officer and trying unsuccessfully to stand up			0
" @entity130 continued to try to stand up while threatening to beat the officer			0
the officer then drive stunned @entity130 on his top left shoulder			0
@entity130 had committed no crime , was strapped down and was in the midst of a medical crisis , " the @entity25 report says			0
" his repeated seizures may also have left him confused and disoriented			0
indeed , there is no indication that @entity130 could carry out his threat against the officers , particularly when he was strapped to the gurney			0
" 13 - year - old punched : after a handcuffed 13 - year - old arrested for shoplifting began to kick a police car 's door and kicked an officer in the leg , the 300 - pound police officer sat on the boy 's legs and punched him in the face until he had a bloody nose			1
the 13 - year - old " was pushing against the officer with his legs , but was handcuffed and posed no threat to the officer , " the @entity25 's report says , noting that @entity17 police have used excessive force on people who are handcuffed or subdued and " pose little or no threat to officers			1
" @entity167 : above a vehicle bay at one of the @entity171 's district stations hangs a sign that reads , " forward operating base , " a term usually used to describe an area of tactical operations in a war zone			0
the sign sends a message indicative of the community 's opinion of the division , @entity25 officials said			0
" this characterization reinforces the view held by some -- both inside and outside the @entity171 -- that @entity171 is an occupying force instead of a true partner and resource in the community it serves , " the investigative report said			2
it 's one illustration , the @entity25 's report says , that " officer training instills in officers an ' us - against - them ' mentality			1
" issues resonate beyond @entity17 the results of the federal review come as the @entity171 is under fire for the november fatal shooting of 12 - year - old @entity202			1
the incident sparked even more outrage amid high tensions over @entity207 's shooting death in @entity208 and similar situations that have put police use of force under a microscope			1
@entity17 police chief @entity214 has defended @entity202 's shooting , saying he reached for an air pistol that was " indistinguishable from a real firearm			1
" while thursday 's announcement was set in @entity17 , attorney general @entity219 said thursday that the problems it highlights are n't contained by city limits			2
" as president @entity225 and i have indicated , the time has come , we think , to do even more			0
the tragic losses of these and far too many other @entity229 , including just last month , the shooting death of 12 - year - old @entity202 here in @entity17 , have really raised urgent national questions , " @entity219 said thursday			1
" and they have sparked an important conversation about the sense of trust that must exist between law enforcement and the communities that they serve and protect			0
" what 's next ? authorities say @entity17 police need better training and more accountability going forward			1
" deeply troubling to us was that some of the specially trained investigators who are charged with conducting unbiased reviews of officers ' use of deadly force admitted to us that they conduct their investigations with the goal of casting the accused officer in the most positive light possible , " the @entity25 's report said			1
the department fails to review its officers ' use of force , investigate other allegations of misconduct , " respond to patterns of at - risk behavior , " enforce appropriate policies and establish " effective community policing strategies , " according to the @entity25			1
" throughout the investigation , the @entity25 provided its observations and concerns to the city , and in response , the division has begun to implement a number of remedial measures , however , much more work is needed , " the department 's statement said			0
as a result of the findings , the city and @entity25 have signed an agreement " to develop a court - enforceable consent decree that will include a requirement for an independent monitor who will oversee and ensure necessary reforms			1
" @entity219 , acting assistant attorney general @entity285 and @entity229 attorney @entity286 met thursday with community leaders , law enforcement officials and elected officials to discuss how to improve that relationship			0
" together , we can build confidence in the division that will ensure compliance with the @entity296 , improve public safety and make the job of delivering police services safer and more effective , " @entity285 said in a statement			0
@entity52 told reporters his officers are committed to improving the department			0
" we will work to make this police department better , " he said			0
" i have confidence we will			0

guns , @entity27 , fists , *chemical* sprays are all used *inappropriately* , probe finds
@entity17 , feds agree to independent monitor to oversee reforms , @entity311 says
investigators reviewing deadly force cast officers in " positive light , " report says
