@entity0 -- there are days when @entity3 seems determined to earn its 12 % approval rating -- and that 14 @entity6 senators are threatening to filibuster any new gun legislation should make your blood boil if you still have a heart to pump it with			1
four months after the @entity15 slaughter , the vast majority of @entity13 still support some sensible new gun laws , but the same legislation has been declared doa by conservative senators			1
it 's enough for some activists to crow that the @entity22 's strategy to stall until public attention moved elsewhere has succeeded			1
the old argument after a mass shooting -- " it 's too soon " -- has been revealed to be the delay and dodge it always was			2
in a democracy , the will of the people is supposed to have some sway			2
and an astounding 91 % of @entity13 back universal background checks -- including 88 % of @entity34 , according to a @entity36 poll			1
reality check : 90 % of @entity13 do n't agree on the awesomeness of apple pie and vanilla ice cream			1
the disconnect between @entity3 and @entity42 has rarely been so stark			2
this should be a no - brainer -- especially because the most " controversial " initial proposals have been dropped because they were considered too politically difficult to pass			0
those included a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban , which is only supported by a narrow majority of the @entity13 people , and a limit on high - capacity magazines @entity54 senate majority leader @entity53 was hotly criticized by liberals for backing off this proposal , but he cited pragmatism -- the need to get 60 votes for passage			1
that @entity53 himself has enjoyed high ratings from the @entity22 and is looking out for the political fortunes of red state democrats running for re-election was a source of some suspicion			1
but even @entity53 's attempt to put forward a less polarizing bill has been met by the threatened @entity6 filibuster			1
there seems to be no reward for being reasonable			0
reid to force a vote thursday on debating gun measures when @entity75 filibustered the nomination of cia director @entity77 , i cheered -- not because i agreed , but because it was a principled attempt to educate the @entity13 people on drone strike policy and because @entity75 pursued the filibuster the traditional " @entity83 " way , taking the @entity85 floor rather than blocking debate with a parliamentary maneuver			1
but this threatened filibuster on guns follows the old obscure obstructionist ways , blocking debate and accountability rather than encouraging it			1
the arguments would - be filibusterers such as sens. @entity75 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 are making sound as if they are principled -- if you do n't pay attention to the facts			2
here 's @entity99 's take : " the measures proposed currently by the majority do not reduce crime , they simply restrict the @entity13 public 's constitutional right to self - defense			1
... these bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the @entity114 and proponents wo n't stop with these restrictions			0
" @entity99 is singing from the current conservative hymnal , but let 's take a closer look			0
his statement is a combination of fictitious fear - mongering ( " these bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the @entity114 " ) and the dystopian slippery slope ( " and proponents wo n't stop with these restrictions			2
" ) let 's start with a reality check on the most predictable of the oppositional bumper stickers : the " assault on @entity130			0
" first , the @entity130 is already enshrined in the @entity131			0
it can not be abridged by legislation			0
moreover , there exists the right to reasonable restrictions , such as the ban on machine guns that has existed in the @entity13 since the 1930s and originally passed with @entity22 support			1
but do n't take my word for it -- listen to conservative @entity145 justice @entity144 , who wrote in the landmark @entity146 , which declared @entity149 's functional ban on handguns unconstitutional : " like most rights , the @entity130 right is not unlimited			0
it is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose : for example , concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the amendment or state analogues			0
" @entity163 's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms			0
[ @entity13 v. ] @entity182 's holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those ' in common use at the time ' finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons			1
" got that ? unless gun advocates are going to start calling @entity193 ( @entity6 ) , there should be some room here for reasonable debate			1
yes , we need to acknowledge that @entity13 use guns differently in urban and rural areas			1
that 's one reason liberal former @entity203 gov. @entity202 had an a rating from the @entity22 when he ran for president in 2004			1
but if politically difficult but clearly constitutional measures such as an assault weapons ban , which @entity208 backed , are n't included in the proposed legislation , we surely should be able to debate this issue rationally and in the open			0
@entity34 are doubling down on irrational appeals and trying to block debate			1
that 's another reason this position is infuriatingly stupid -- it compounds the number one negative perception about the @entity34			2
namely , that it is " inflexible and unwilling to compromise			0
" why be afraid of an open debate and an up or down vote on this issue ? republicans such as @entity223 and @entity224 have pointed out the counterproductive nature of this threatened filibuster , with @entity224 saying on @entity228 ' " @entity227 " : " the purpose of the @entity85 is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand			2
" he added , sensibly : " what are we afraid of ? " that 's a good question			0
and the answer is hiding in plain sight			0
@entity6 senators are afraid of a conservative primary challenge fueled by huge amounts of outside money backed by activists and lobbying groups such as the @entity22			1
i genuinely believe that both parties have good ideas and good people -- and principled voices are arguing for a constructive compromise and a real debate on this issue			2
opponents ca n't even defend their inaction by arguing they are representing their constituents because of the overwhelming bipartisan margins for the proposed increased background checks and cracking down on gun - trafficking			1
but hyperpartisan politics are once again threatening to trump policy - driven problem solving			0
that 's why @entity3 has such a dismal approval rating in the first place			0
on tuesday and wednesday , parents who lost children in the @entity15 massacre will be walking the halls of @entity3 , trying to appeal to the conscience of our legislators			0
it will be interesting to see whether their personal appeals will carry as much weight as the influence of gun lobbyists			2
this issue is n't academic -- it is an urgent test of our elected representatives ' ability to be responsive to the public will and reason together			0
if @entity15 ca n't get @entity149 's attention , what will ? the shooting of a colleague , @entity284 , apparently did n't			0
conscience and compassion should matter more than cold hard cash			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity290 .			2

@entity293 background checks on gun *buyers* *favored* by 90 % of @entity13
@entity290 says the threatened @entity6 filibuster would *thwart* democracy
he says the arguments against background checks are bogus
