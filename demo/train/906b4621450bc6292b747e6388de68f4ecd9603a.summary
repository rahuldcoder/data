-- as backlash against airline passenger pat - downs intensified with a viral online video , the nation 's top airline security official said monday that his agency is walking a fine line between privacy concerns and public safety			1
a short video clip circulating on the internet shows a shirtless boy receiving a pat - down from a @entity15 agent			1
his father watches , hands on his hips , obstructing part of the view			2
but the words playing in the background are clear			0
" are they harassing a kid ? " one man asks			0
" it 's ridiculous , " another voice chimes in			0
" finance student @entity27 said he started recording the incident with his cell phone when he saw the " visibly upset " father while waiting in line friday at the airport in @entity33 , @entity34			2
" it was an interesting situation			0
i never saw a little boy with his shirt off getting a pat down , " @entity27 told @entity0			1
@entity15 spokesman @entity39 said screeners searched the child after he set off a metal detector alarm			1
" the father removed his son 's shirt in order to speed up the screening process			0
once screening was complete , both proceeded to the gate for their flight , " @entity39 said in a statement			0
asked about the incident monday on @entity0 's " @entity55 , " @entity15 administrator @entity53 said his understanding was the same as the account @entity39 gave			1
the @entity15 is trying to strike a delicate balance , @entity53 said -- ensuring the safety of the traveling public while taking privacy concerns into account			1
" the bottom line is , everybody wants to arrive safely at their destination , " he said			2
in the short term , no changes will be made as the holiday season approaches			0
some 2 million people a day are expected to travel on tuesday and wednesday of this week			0
a @entity72 man , who endured what he called an " extremely embarrassing " pat - down this month , disagreed			1
" these new pat - downs have to be stopped until [ @entity15 agents ] are trained and are comfortable doing what they need to do , " @entity75 told @entity0 's " @entity55			1
" @entity75 , a bladder cancer survivor who has worn a urostomy bag since a surgery three years ago , said a @entity15 agent at @entity85 caused the seal of the bag to open partially during a pat - down , spilling urine on his clothes			1
@entity75 said he tried to caution the agent against pressing too hard on his abdomen because of the bag			2
the agent did n't understand and continued with the search , @entity75 said , and " pulled the seal kind of half off " the bag			2
" these people need to be trained on medical conditions ... and emotional conditions , " @entity75 said			0
he said the agent " did n't apologize , he did n't do anything			0
" " i 'm a good @entity103 , i know why we 're doing this and i understand it , " @entity75 said			0
" but this was extremely embarrassing , and it did n't have to happen			0
with educated @entity15 workers , it would n't have happened			1
" on monday , the @entity15 said @entity53 had reached out @entity75 to hear about his experience and assure him that officials would look into the matter			1
" we have done extensive outreach to the disability community , and our officers take seriously their responsibility to be respectful and professional throughout the screening process , " the @entity15 said in a statement			1
@entity53 pointed out that the pat - downs are not mandatory -- passengers receive them only if they opt out of a screening with advanced - imaging technology			1
the technology is the @entity15 's best effort , he said , to head off attacks such as the would - be @entity128 last year			1
@entity128 allegedly had a bomb sewn into his underwear on a flight from @entity133 , @entity134 , to @entity85			0
asked whether the technology and pat - downs would have been able to find that device , @entity53 said he believes they would have , saying it would have shown up as " an anomaly " with the imaging technology and then might have been located in a pat - down			1
there has never been an explosive found on a flight from one @entity103 city to another , @entity53 acknowledged			0
but , he pointed out , domestic terrorists exist -- @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 , for instance -- and there are people who want to do the government harm			0
while @entity103 is " fortunate " that such an incident has not occurred on a domestic flight , he said , it could conceivably happen			0
" we welcome feedback and comments on the screening procedures from the traveling public , and we will work to make them as minimally invasive as possible while still providing the security that the @entity103 people want and deserve , " @entity53 said in a statement released sunday			2
" we are constantly evaluating and adapting our security measures , and as we have said from the beginning , we are seeking to strike the right balance between privacy and security			2
" but rep. @entity173 told @entity0 's " @entity180 " on sunday the enhanced screening shows the @entity15 is " headed in the wrong direction as far as who they 're screening and how they 're doing it			1
" " i do n't think the rollout was good and the application is even worse , " he said			0
" this does need to be refined			0
but he 's saying it 's the only tool and i believe that 's wrong			0
" the @entity188 @entity187 , who will be chairman of the @entity190 in january , has argued that airports should hire private security screeners			2
the ramped - up use of pat - downs and full - body scanning is needed to stop nonmetallic threats including weapons and explosives from getting aboard planes , the @entity15 said			1
and it appears that most @entity103 agree			0
in a recent @entity202 poll , four out of five @entity103 supported the use of full - body scans			2
president @entity205 stood by the new controversial screening measures saturday , calling methods such as pat - downs and body scans necessary to assure airline safety			1
the president told reporters that the balance between protecting travelers ' rights and their security is a " tough situation " but stressed such methods are needed after what happened last @entity219			2
but @entity205 's support has n't stopped a growing group of objectors , from civil rights and privacy advocates to scientists and pilots , from loudly claiming these measures are too invasive , ineffective and possibly unsafe			0
secretary of state @entity228 , asked by @entity202 ' " @entity229 " on sunday whether she would submit to an enhanced pat - down , laughed and said , " not if i could avoid it			1
no , i mean , who would ? " @entity53 noted monday that @entity233 went on to say she understands the importance and focus on travelers ' security			2
some are calling the frenzied travel day before @entity240 , " urging travelers selected for full - body scanning to refuse			2
travelers have the right to opt out of full - body scanning , according to the @entity15 , but the pat - down alternative has , in turn , created its own public furor			1
last week , a @entity249 , @entity250 , man 's viral video of his clash with security screeners spawned several t - shirt designs with his " do n't touch my junk " quip			1
and @entity0 affiliates around the country have reported examples of passengers who say they find pat - downs embarrassing or invasive			1
but @entity53 has told @entity0 the outcry over the new screening was overblown			0
" very few people actually receive the pat - down			1
in spite of all the public furor about this , very few people do , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity271 and @entity272 contributed to this report .			0
