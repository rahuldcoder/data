@entity0 , @entity2 's largest oil producer , ended oil subsidies on @entity4 that had kept gasoline prices artificially low			1
the cost of a liter of gasoline shot up from 65 naira ( 40 cents ) to at least 141 naira ( 86 cents ) virtually overnight			0
furious @entity0 have since taken to the streets , staging ' @entity11 ' protests and mass demonstrations across the country			1
police have responded forcefully with many arrests			0
at least one person has died amid the unrest : 23 - year - old student @entity18 was allegedly hit by a police bullet in @entity20 , @entity21 , on january 03			2
are you there ? send your images or video a police spokesman in @entity28 also confirmed to @entity29 that they fired teargas into a crowd staging a midnight protest last week in order to disperse a largely peaceful demonstration by @entity35 and @entity36			2
what is the background to the decision ? the government is attempting to deregulate the oil sector in the country and believes subsidizing consumption of oil is a drain on public finances that will prove unsustainable in the long term			2
many argue that the only people the subsidy benefited were fuel importers			1
the government says the move will save the @entity53 more than 1 trillion naira ( $ 6.13 billion ) in 2012			2
@entity54 , spokesman for president @entity55 , told @entity29 the money saved from removing the subsidy will help to improve public amenities and build much - needed infrastructure in a country with poor roads , lack of power and non-functioning refineries			2
@entity0 produces around 2.4 million barrels of crude oil a day but imports roughly 70 % of its gasoline from countries as far afield as the @entity69 and @entity70 , because its own refineries are inoperative after years of corruption - fueled neglect			1
why has it caused such an outcry ? @entity0 are angry because they believe the government has introduced the plan without any regard to how it will affect the cost of living in the country			1
they say they are already experiencing undue hardship as a result of the move , which they say has already affected the cost of transport , food , medicine , rent and school fees			0
@entity90 , an accountant and analyst , told @entity29 the government 's abrupt move was like having a " tooth pulled without a plier			1
" " when you have so much poverty , a lot of business and lives have been built on petrol being at @entity102 , which is not exactly cheap , even at subsidized rates			0
people are just not moving out of poverty quickly in @entity0			1
there is an economic case but this is not something that can be quantified economically , " he said			0
" the government can not tell how many businesses will be ruined or even how many people will die , " @entity90 continued			2
" the impact will be so wide - ranging			0
there should have been a plan to remove this in a sensible way , not in this crude manner			0
many @entity0 see the subsidy , which gives them the cheapest gas price in the region , as the only benefit of being an oil producing country			1
most live in grinding poverty and on less than $ 2 a day			0
there is little infrastructure , high unemployment and only intermittent electric power			0
@entity0 routinely have to buy generators to provide power and supporters of the subsidies say some may be left in the dark because they simply can not afford fuel costs			1
is there an economic case for the removal ? those who support ending the subsidy removal say the move is long overdue because of simple economics			1
they argue that @entity0 have been paying @entity102 ( 40 cents ) per liter for at least five years , while petrol prices have risen significantly elsewhere in the world , which means the government foots the bill when worldwide oil prices go up			1
they also say that the only people who get any real benefit from the subsidy are those involved in importing oil			0
the @entity0 oil traders import refined gasoline , claim the subsidy and then sell it on at a higher rate to neighboring countries			1
how will @entity0 benefit from any money saved ? there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure it says it will			1
@entity0 is regularly voted among the most corrupt countries in the world and citizens complain that the money saved will be siphoned by a few and salted away into off - shore accounts , as has happened in the past			1
they also bemoan the high salaries and daily allowances of government officials			0
according to transparency for @entity0 website , the country 's senators receive an annual pay of @entity180 ( $ 1.2m )			1
the national monthly minimum wage is set at @entity182 , 000 ( $ 112 ) , although all @entity0 do not currently receive this basic wage			1
while at the 2012 national expenditure reading in december , @entity184 alone ( $ 6.2m ) was allocated for the president and vice president 's annual food and general catering services			0
the sum includes the cost of purchasing foodstuffs , catering supplies and kitchen equipment for the president and his deputy 's offices and residences , according to the 2012 @entity199 presented to the @entity200			0
however , government spokesman @entity54 told @entity29 he understood @entity0 ' concerns regarding a lack of trust because they had been let down by previous administrations			1
he added that the president has set up a high - powered committee to ensure money saved from ending the subsidy would not be misappropriated			2
what will happen next ? @entity211 unrest and instability in the country is expected over the next few days , with citizens calling for a return to the cheap prices			0
so far , the government has refused but has announced the " immediate distribution of 1600 mass transit buses to major cities			0
" labor union leaders have called for national strikes and protests that they hope will lead to a mass shutdown across the country			0
" we call on all @entity0 to participate actively in this movement to rescue our country			2
the emphasis is on peaceful protests , rallies and strikes while refusing to be intimidated , " the unions ' statement said			0
there are also calls from some quarters for president @entity55 to be impeached .			0
