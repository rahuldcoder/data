@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration proposed updated guidelines on friday that would allow religious - affiliated organizations opposing contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control			1
the draft rule would give women at non-profit , religious - based organizations , like certain hospitals and universities , the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge			1
the compromise is consistent with last year 's announcement by president @entity3 on the contraception mandate , administration officials said			1
it also continues his administration 's attempts to resolve the contentious issue of how non-profit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty			1
" today , the administration is taking the next step in providing women across the nation with coverage of recommended preventive care at no cost , while respecting religious concerns , " @entity35 secretary @entity34 said in a statement			1
" we will continue to work with faith - based organizations , women 's organizations , insurers and others to achieve these goals , " she said			2
as part of the new initiative , groups that are insured -- such as student health plans at religious colleges -- would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage			1
" the insurer would then notify enrollees that it is providing them with no - cost contraceptive coverage through separate individual health insurance policies , " the @entity35 statement said			2
although the agency has not estimated final costs of the plan , it said that offering free coverage would actually lower expenses over the long term , partly due to improvement in women 's health and fewer childbirths			1
case fuels debate over when life begins because the insurer would be covering the costs , the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it			1
an original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal healthcare law spearheaded by @entity3 , the @entity88			1
it required that insurers provide , at no cost to those insured , all forms of contraception approved by the @entity91			1
houses of worship were exempt immediately and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations , like universities and hospitals			0
that still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths , many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong , covered by the mandate			1
they denounced it as an infringement of religious liberty			0
a group of 43 @entity116 organizations challenged the rules in federal court in may			2
the administration had long defended the mandate , saying that it did not violate religious liberties			0
the new proposal also clarifies the definition of a religious employer			2
instead of using a multi-part test that requires an employer to show " religious values as its purpose " and to " employ persons who share its religious tenets , " the proposed requirement would follow the @entity134 's definition that includes " churches , other houses of worship , and their affiliated organizations			2
" following an uproar among religious institutions that did n't want to pay for contraceptives , the @entity3 administration in march offered several alternatives			1
the plan unveiled on friday is a result of that effort			0
the updated rules proposal will be open for public comment through april 8			2
the administration would then decide whether to make it final			0
a source with knowledge of the matter but not authorized to speak on the record said administration officials planned to discuss the new plan with faith - based organizations on friday			0
the source also said the administration called key leaders , including presidents of @entity116 universities , before the announcement			0
women 's groups , including @entity164 and @entity165 , heralded the announcement " today 's draft regulation affirms yet again the @entity3 administration 's commitment to fulfilling the full promise of its historic contraception policy , " said @entity166 , president of @entity165			1
" thanks to this commitment , most @entity173 women will get birth control coverage without extra expense			2
" " this policy makes it clear that your boss does not get to decide whether you can have birth control , " said @entity178 , president of @entity164			0
cardinal @entity184 of @entity185 , president of the @entity186 , took a wait - and - see approach			0
lawyers for @entity116 hospital argue that a fetus is not a person today , the administration issued proposed regulations regarding the @entity35 mandate " he said in a statement			0
" we welcome the opportunity to study the proposed regulations closely			0
we look forward to issuing a more detailed statement later			0
" not all groups characterized it as a compromise , however			0
@entity204 , national director of @entity205 , a group that launched a federal lawsuit against the mandate last year , said he was far from happy with the update and welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback			2
" we at @entity205 remind the administration that religious liberty does not just belong to religious groups and individuals ; it belongs to all @entity173 , " @entity204 said			1
" we see only one acceptable change regarding the mandate : rescind it completely			0
" the @entity217 , a conservative pro-life group , released a similar statement			0
" the proposal does not expand religious freedom to all organizations and does nothing to change the current policy that forces religious entities to pay for insurance plans that include abortion - inducing drugs , sterilizations and contraception , " said @entity219 , director of the group 's @entity220			1
the issue of @entity3 's health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot - button political issue during last year 's presidential race			1
@entity1 's @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 contributed to this report .			0

proposed rules would permit certain groups like hospitals , *schools* to decline to provide contraception coverage for religious reasons
but women would still get coverage ; outside provider would pay for contraception separately
proposal would be shift in policy , could ease *friction* between @entity3 and religious groups
new : one group says proposal does nothing to change current policy
