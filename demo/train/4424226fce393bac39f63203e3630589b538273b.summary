-- last week in @entity2 , @entity3 , the blinds were raised in a small , white , antiseptic room , and two small groups of people watched as @entity7 was strapped to a gurney			1
a doctor examined @entity7 's body for usable veins and then oversaw the administration of an untested drug cocktail that was supposed to dispatch the convicted murderer quickly and quietly			0
instead , the blinds were lowered as the execution turned into more than 40 minutes of grimacing , writhing , teeth grinding and frantic phone calls			1
then @entity7 's heart finally seized , stopped beating , and his breath left his body			0
this is how we kill our most serious criminals in the 21st century			1
or at least try to			0
so if this is justice , let 's make it real			0
let 's make it open to the highest form of public transparency and scrutiny : live tv			1
@entity3 's botched lethal injection marks new front in battle over executions in the @entity40 , the preferred method of executing prisoners was to draw and quarter , burn , boil alive and separate body parts of the condemned , exacting a measure of slow and painful torture before death			1
at some point in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , society decided that executing prisoners more quickly would be more " humane			1
" the @entity52 invented the guillotine , the @entity50 of @entity51 introduced throat cutting , or would tie a prisoner to a cannon and blow him apart , and the @entity57 developed the " long drop " method of hanging to snap the neck and sever the spine of the executed			0
in 1936 , the last public execution in the @entity63 was held in @entity64 , @entity65			1
it was witnessed by more than 20,000 people , including hundreds of reporters			1
from that point forward , states decided that executions needed to be private affairs , held in small rooms and witnessed only by agents of the state , lawyers , family members of the victim and a handful of journalists			2
in the years since @entity64 , the states -- with the approval of the @entity63 @entity83 -- have refined their definition of humane executions by utilizing firing squads , electric chairs and gas chambers			1
the states further sanitized the execution process by developing the lethal injection method , turning it into a medical procedure complete with operating table , intravenous injections and considerable ethical questions for doctors and pharmaceutical companies who have sworn to " do no harm			2
" none of these refinements in execution technology has anything to do with " humane " methods			1
there is no real measurement for how painful a death prisoners suffer when they are being hanged , shot , gassed or electrocuted , no matter how quickly they die			2
lethal injection simply gives us greater psychological distance from killing another human being , making it feel more like a doctor - prescribed procedure than an execution			2
@entity115 , another death row inmate in @entity3 , was killed in january in the same chamber , uttering his final words , " i feel my whole body burning			2
" and while many have used the word " botched " to describe @entity7 's execution , it was n't botched at all			2
that 's just how messy , complicated and disturbing it is to kill another human being			2
what is missing from the death penalty debate is that there is no humane way to kill another person			1
we consider taking a victim 's life during a crime to be cruel and unusual , yet we neatly sidestep this same @entity136 standard with prisoners by attempting to conduct a quick and " painless " execution			2
president @entity139 has called for a @entity141 investigation into the death penalty following @entity7 's execution			1
" in the application of the death penalty in this country , we have seen significant problems -- racial bias , uneven application of the death penalty , you know , situations in which there were individuals on death row who later on were discovered to have been innocent because of exculpatory evidence , " @entity139 said			1
" and all these , i think , do raise significant questions about how the death penalty is being applied			1
" but while i applaud the president 's actions , the question is not how the death penalty is applied , but whether it should be applied at all			1
it is natural to be both horrified and angered at the senseless and brutal killings committed by a convicted murderer			0
it is natural to want revenge -- to visit the pain we imagine the victim suffered onto his or her perpetrator			0
but there is a difference between punishment and revenge , no matter how we dress it up with legislation and legal procedures			0
we have built a system of laws to raise us above those we judge			0
in this system we have built , we must be honest and ask ourselves , " is vengeance justice ? " if we want truly to codify revenge , let 's not pretend			0
let 's admit that we are willing to live with the byproducts of our retribution			1
let 's admit that we are willing to kill a number of innocent people			1
let 's admit that it is fine to execute a disproportionate number of minorities			0
and let 's admit that we want condemned murderers to suffer like they made their victims suffer			0
let 's not dress the execution up as a medical procedure			2
and by all means , let 's televise it			0
let 's watch them pump the drugs into a condemned man or woman , strapped to a gurney			0
let 's hear their last words			0
let 's watch them writhe and twitch , or listen as they groan and their last breath quietly leaves their body			0
let 's watch them die			0
let us see what we are really choosing when we vote to implement the death penalty in our state			1
many @entity63 support the death penalty in principle			1
but , as a juror in a capital case , it is different when you look across that courtroom and stare into the eyes of the accused			2
at that point it is real , and not just a principle			0
you will decide whether that person dies			0
let 's make the death penalty real			1
let 's open the blinds and stare into the eyes of those we condemn to death			0
let 's be honest about what the death penalty really is			1
and then we can choose what kind of society we really want to be			0
join us on @entity253 / @entity252 .			0

@entity255 : recent failed execution makes the case against death penalty
the last public execution in the @entity63 was in 1936 , witnessed by 20,000 people
@entity255 says he believes there is no humane way to kill another person
we should be willing , he says , to live with the byproducts of our retribution
