no nation is immune to the impact of climate change but it is the world 's poorest that will be hit the hardest			1
a fair and inclusive global agreement to combat climate change is a moral imperative			1
time is of the essence for @entity9			1
world leaders are gathering today in @entity11 for the @entity12 in an attempt to breathe new life into climate talks , which are now approaching their 21st round			2
with the @entity19 deadline fast approaching , it remains to be seen how much international support @entity9 can leverage to advance its agenda			2
we all know that enlightened leadership is essential			0
politicians must think beyond their tenure			0
countries must look beyond their borders			0
we need a radical rethink of how the world makes and uses energy			0
but with @entity32 and @entity33 -- which together account for almost a third of global emissions -- deciding not to attend , it will be a challenge for the @entity12 to fulfill its potential			1
in @entity32 and @entity33 's absence , small , developing nations must unite			1
it is they that bear the greatest burden of climate change			1
we can no longer wait for the world 's dominant powers to act benevolently for the benefit of all humanity			2
all countries , regardless of their level of development , must look to reduce their own co2 emissions			0
we must prevent further warming and reverse the trend			0
we must act to mitigate the effects of climate change that are already being felt throughout the world			1
there is no doubt that climate change threatens to derail @entity9 's impressive recent growth and compromise the socio - economic gains made over the last decade			1
@entity9 's development relies heavily on climate - sensitive sectors including agriculture , fishing and tourism			1
agriculture alone accounts for 30 % of @entity9 's gdp and 50 % of the continent 's total exports			1
even if the present pledges to limit emissions by 2020 are fulfilled , global temperature is still predicted to increase by 3.5 to 4 degrees @entity76 by 2100			0
this would lead to a 30 % reduction in rainfall in @entity9 , which would be disastrous on a continent in which 96 % of agriculture is rain fed. persistent drought and flooding are already exacerbating food and water insecurity , threatening livelihoods and health			1
severe droughts in the @entity90 and the @entity91 between 2011 and 2012 saw crops fail and livestock die , leaving 13 million people in need of humanitarian assistance			0
the effectiveness with which @entity9 addresses the link between food production , water and energy will determine how many millions are pulled out of poverty in the coming decades			2
no less than a climate - smart agricultural revolution is needed to guarantee food security			2
water management strategies must be developed to protect and rehabilitate groundwater sources and river basins			0
the energy sector should be geared towards the promotion and adoption of clean and renewable sources of power			0
and @entity116 governments and business leaders must make significant investments in science and technology to support mitigation and adaptation efforts			0
while international assistance is vital , effective and sustainable solutions must be developed locally			0
developing nations have the opportunity to ' do it right			0
' partnerships must be created to share technology and best practice			0
we must end the specter of national self - interest in a world where climate change knows no boundaries			1
if emerging economies focus on growth at all costs we risk handing future generations a terrible legacy			0
there is a wealth of evidence to show that the impact of climate change will be more expensive than the changes needed to halt it			1
but what is clear is that for the first time @entity9 is not on the back foot			2
the continent is beginning to adopt a proactive approach to tackling climate change , empowering its people and strengthening its institutions			1
the continent 's impressive economic growth , buoyed by an export boom , improved governance and increased foreign investment has fueled the ' @entity162 ' narrative			1
by 2050 , a quarter of the global population will be @entity116 , and 60 % of @entity116 will live in cities			0
the continent is on the cusp of a transformation			2
policy makers are developing ambitious plans to create clean and green economies across @entity9			2
partnerships are being forged between government , the private sector and civil society for the swift implementation of national climate action plans			2
in the absence of global leadership from those countries which contribute most to climate change , small , developing nations must do what they can to ensure that their interests are represented before it 's too late			1
ahead of next year 's crucial @entity187 in @entity188 , which will set a new agenda to replace the @entity19 , it is essential that @entity116 countries not only make their voices heard , but they make them count			0

@entity194 : @entity195 's poorest will be hit the hardest by climate change
he *argues* climate change threatens @entity9 's recent socio - economic gains
@entity202 says continent needs to take a more proactive climate approach
big *carbon* *emitters* like @entity32 and @entity33 seem to have lost interest in @entity209 process
