@entity18 , @entity19 and sports science at @entity5 , says the 26 - year - old may not have recovered in time to launch his country 's charge for the trophy			0
he told @entity5 's official web site : " you ca n't be absolutely certain of anything but at this stage , if he continues to progress the way he is , he should be fit to play at some stage during the @entity4			1
" whether he 'll be fit for the first game or not is uncertain			0
we 're anxious not to hurry him along too much because we want the long - term benefit , but we 're aware he 's got the short - term goal of playing in the @entity4			2
" meanwhile , @entity39 coach @entity38 has been dealt a double blow ahead of the @entity4 after goalkeeper @entity41 and midfielder @entity42 were ruled out of the tournament through injury			1

" the pain is so great that i would not have been able to perform at my best over the longer term both in training and during matches			0
" in such a long and intensive tournament , that is unacceptable			0
you need players who are totally fit			0
" @entity42 , who also plays for @entity47 , has been out of action since an operation on a knee injury back in january and will not be adding to his 21 caps at the finals in @entity76			1
he said : " i am very pleased with the healing process but it is now definitively clear that the @entity4 finals for me make no sense			1

it only remains for me now to wish the team every success in @entity76			0
