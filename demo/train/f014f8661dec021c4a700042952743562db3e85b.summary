@entity0 -- @entity2 , 64 , shot his first gun when he was 11			1
" my dad bought me a single - shot .22 rifle at an @entity6 in @entity7 for $ 19.95 , " @entity2 remembered			1
" i used to take that gun on the bus when i was 11 years old and go down to the shooting range			1
you could n't do that now ; you would have the @entity13 on you			0
" those bus trips to the firing range started a lifelong passion for the @entity18 veteran and lifetime @entity21 member and recruiter who owns @entity2 's @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25			1
why would someone own a military - style rifle ? his shop sells everything from handguns to @entity32 semi-automatic rifles -- the military - style weapon used in several mass shootings , including the one last week in @entity35 , @entity36 , that claimed 28 lives , including 20 children , their principal , the shooter 's mother and gunman @entity43 , who took his own life			1
@entity2 's business is booming			0
and like many gun owners , he said he does n't think limiting firearms will prevent another massacre			1
parents defend right to keep guns in the home " gun control is not the answer ; it 's about education and about responsibility , " said @entity2 , who supports background checks , a waiting period , gun safety courses and mental health screening			1
@entity2 and millions of other small - town gun shop owners , hunters , housewives , former police officers and just plain everyday folks who proudly defend their right to bear arms have walked a tenuous line in the week following the @entity35 shootings			1
they 've tried to balance responding to the nation 's grief and horror at a crime that ended so many young lives , while worrying about what gun rights advocates see as a threat of knee - jerk legislation that could tread on their constitutional rights			1
" i believe the @entity82 provided that the average @entity84 citizen should have the same rights to armaments as the military			0
but do i want my next - door nut job neighbor to have a bazooka ? no , " said @entity90 , a @entity91 attorney and gun rights advocate			1
@entity93 , a young gun owner in @entity94 , agrees			2
@entity93 , 22 , lives in @entity95 , @entity96 , and has three guns -- a .22 rifle , a .25 - caliber pocket pistol and a .22 @entity101 handgun			2
he also is a class - a license holder , which allows him to " conceal and carry " his guns with him			2
but that does n't mean that he does it			0
@entity106 : was your gun banned ? his weapons , he said , are for protection			2
he also said he does n't need an assault rifle to protect himself in his home and does n't think other people need them either			0
" i absolutely think we should ban assault weapons , " @entity93 said			0
" there is no reason to have assault weapons on the market			0
... those are people killers ; they are not meant to go hunting			0
" still , even though he believes in some gun control laws , @entity93 said he fully supports the right to bear arms			1
the @entity21 , a powerful gun lobby with roughly 4.3 million members , spoke out on friday , calling for armed guards at schools to protect the nation 's children			1
the group signaled no willingness to consider any of the various proposals offered this week to change gun laws regarding access to assault weapons , universal background checks , limits on sales at gun shows , increased use of trigger locks or any other gun control regulation			1
instead , the group pointed at media sensationalism , violent video games , gun - free zones , the failure to enforce gun laws already on the books , issues with the nation 's mental health system and other societal problems			1
policies banning guns at schools create a place that " insane killers " consider " the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk , " @entity156 , executive vice president of the @entity21 said on friday			1
@entity156 said @entity84 society has left children " utterly defenseless			0
" " the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun , " he said			2
in the days following the school shootings , individual @entity21 members took to @entity174 , @entity175 , the airwaves and the comment sections of websites such as @entity1 to explain their position			1
it usually went along these lines : they are not all gun - toting villains			1
they are , they proudly proclaim , patriots			0
" guns are what 's kept this country free , and it 's what 's keeping our country free , " @entity2 said , pointing to the militias in the @entity189 that fought against the @entity190			2
@entity21 breaks silence after shootings the @entity21 plans to speak out friday and " is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again			1
" not everyone is buying the " meaningful contributions , " however			0
" i think the statement they just released is a bunch of garbage ; they just wanted to get ahead of the issue , " @entity93 said			2
" if you look at their history , they are hard - core ' guns do n't kill people , people kill people			2
' " as soon as little kids get hurt , they try to get ahead of the picture saying , ' we 're going to do something			0
' " this week , president @entity219 tapped vice president @entity220 to help lead a @entity222 effort to craft proposals aimed at preventing another tragedy such as the @entity35 shootings			2
the recommendations are due sometime in january			0
that same month , several lawmakers have promised to introduce or reintroduce gun control legislation , ranging from a reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons to banning the sale of high - capacity magazines			1
the @entity21 , which is regrouping in anticipation of that massive legislative push , will make its presence felt through congressional testimony and wielding the type of political sway the pro-gun lobby has carefully amassed over dozens of election cycles , experts said			1
" i want to see legislators make correct appraisals , not emotional responses , " said @entity243 , who was regional political director for the @entity21 during its rise to power in the 1980s and is president of a gun rights group called the @entity248			1
the list : despite emotions , little happens legislatively after mass shootings across the rest of the nation , attitudes about guns appear to be changing			2
a @entity1 / @entity260 poll released wednesday indicates that a slight majority now favor major restrictions on owning guns or an outright ban on gun ownership by ordinary citizens and more than six in 10 favor a ban on semi-automatic assault rifles			2
the number of @entity84 who favor major restrictions or an outright ban has typically hovered just under the 50 % mark in recent years ; now that number is 52 %			2
that 's a rise in 5 percentage points from a @entity1 survey conducted in august following the mass shootings at a movie theater in suburban @entity282 that left 12 dead and shootings at a @entity285 temple in suburban @entity286 , where six people were killed			2
the 5 - point rise is within the poll 's sampling error			2
forty - three percent said the elementary school shootings in @entity36 make them more likely to support gun control laws , a 15 - point increase from january 2011 following the @entity295 gun rampage that wounded @entity84 rep. @entity296			1
half of those questioned said the school shootings have not changed their opinions on gun control , down 19 points from january 2011			1
but that 's just roughly half of the country			0
the other half is made up of the kind of people who have flooded @entity2 's suburban @entity0 shop after the @entity35 shootings			0
people who , like @entity2 , believe that if @entity313 teachers were armed , they would have been able to kill the shooter before he killed all those children			0
@entity43 's guns : what we know so far " last night i did n't get out until 10 , " @entity2 said through a mouthful of a rushed lunch			0
he 's almost sold out of ar - 15s , he said			0
he just sold two wednesday morning to a man who wanted them for his sons			0
since the gun sales are not reported , trends in gun sales are typically tracked by the number of background checks the @entity13 conducts each year			1
in 2011 -- a record year -- the @entity13 conducted 16,454,951 background checks			0
in 2012 , not counting the month of december , the @entity13 has already conducted 16,808,538			0
this includes the run on guns after @entity219 's re-election but does not include the recent sprint to buy up weapons after the @entity35 shootings			1
and @entity2 's store 's sales are not an anomaly ; gun stores across the country are reporting record sales in the week following the @entity35 shootings			1
@entity2 said gun owners are worried they wo n't be able to purchase semi-automatic rifles such as the @entity32 in the future , so they are buying them up now			1
those concerns are rooted in the fear that tampering with @entity82 rights could lead to a slippery slope of infringing on other constitutional rights , gun policy experts said			0
" with respect to assault rifles , i have a constitutional right to have one			0
... that 's what our founding father and mothers recognized , " said @entity243 of the @entity248			0
" it 's what it protects us from -- the possibility of a tyrannical government			0
" i do n't think we 're going to have a tyrannical government , and i do n't think @entity219 ( is going to bring about a ) tyrannical government			0
if we take away the @entity82 , maybe it would			0
" opinion : strong case for gun rights @entity1 's @entity373 and @entity374 contributed to this report .			0

new : the @entity21 calls for armed guards at schools
gun owners have walked a careful line in the wake of the @entity36 shootings
gun sales are up across the country in anticipation of possible gun - control legislation
some gun owners part with the @entity21 on policies , calling its recent *announcement* " garbage "
