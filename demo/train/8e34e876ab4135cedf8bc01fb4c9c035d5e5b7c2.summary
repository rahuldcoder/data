" @entity1 " tvs have failed because they 've always assumed more is better			0
instead of evolving the television experience , tv makers have simply added to it , heaping more streams , more services , and more content onto our sets without rethinking the interfaces for accessing them			1
the same problem plagues the services that power those smart tvs			2
@entity14 offers thousands of options for what to watch , but instead of giving you a chance to skip through and sample them , it makes you evaluate each one , like a title on a video - store shelf			1
in both cases , the experience has become more about selecting a piece of content than simply watching tv			1
the result ? more ends up feeling like a lot less			0
that 's the central problem plaguing both set - top boxes like @entity31 and @entity32 and content services like @entity14 and @entity34			1
instead of letting you lean back and soak up content , these new challengers require decisions -- a careful cost - benefit analysis of thousands of different options			1
if the traditional tv experience is about letting viewers surf channels , today 's on - demand video is like giving them a speedboat and forcing them choose a destination before they can even get in the water			1
it 's the fundamental reason smart tv and streaming video user interfaces pale in comparison to regular tv for so much of our daily viewing			1
and it 's a shame			2
the channels we 've always known are the perfect interface for tv			2
for some reason , we seem hell - bent on abandoning them			0
the simple joy of channel surfing channel surfing sounds like a ' 90s relic , something we did when we were a nation of mindless couch potatoes , not yet graced with on - demand content and our sophisticated second screens			1
here 's the thing , though : we 're still couch potatoes ! according to the @entity70 labor department , @entity70 on average watch nearly three hours of tv a day			1
@entity73 pegs it even higher , at 42 hours a week , with only three of those hours happening on laptops or mobile devices			0
how a math genius hacked @entity79 to find true love it 's hard to find data that breaks down what we 're watching , but i 'll bet only a fraction is spent digesting hour - long cable dramas			1
that daily figure is n't so high because we 're tuning in to must - see tv â€” rather , it 's the opposite			1
we get home and we flip on the set			0
we change into comfortable clothes , drink a glass of wine , make dinner , surf the web a little bit from a couch			0
in between all those things we click around from channel to channel to find something to fill the air			2
it does n't have to be riveting			2
often times , it 's better if it 's not			0
what regular tv really offers is low - stakes , ambient entertainment			0
that 's something that 's utterly missing from @entity14 , @entity34 , @entity31 , and @entity32			1
consider , for example , a strange paradox of the streaming video age : you 'll totally watch an hour of " ghostbusters " on @entity116 , but you 'd never in a million years start it up from the top on @entity14 , even though it 's always right there , just a dozen clicks away			1
@entity123 's greatest innovations : the first decade that example gets to the heart of what makes channel surfing so great			1
it 's a zero - commitment affair			0
it 's a fundamentally passive way to consume media , whereas today 's streaming video libraries demand agency on the part of the viewer			1
@entity14 is great when you want to watch something , but it 's terrible when you want to watch anything			1
set - top boxes take too many clicks consider how much friction there is in using today 's streaming services , purely on a nuts - and - bolts level			1
with regular tv , you press one button and something 's on your screen			2
mash on the remote again and there 's another show in front of you			0
channel surfing is beautifully elegant in terms of input and output : a pure one - to - one relationship between tactile action and visual stimulus			0
one click on the slippery little remote to wake it up ; several more to navigate the grid - based ui to the " channel " of your choice			0
even with the fistful of live tv apps now available on the device , the experience has none of the fluidity of real tv			2
say you want to see what 's on watch @entity178			2
you have to click its icon , then navigate a sub-menu of @entity178 's various channels			0
it does n't show you what 's on any of them			2
you just have to click into @entity178 , see what 's on , click back , then click @entity178 2 , and so forth			2
@entity14 needs to be a stream , not just a library when compared to the rest of our media diet , though , the bigger problems with streaming services such as @entity14 quickly come into focus			1
as we 've heard again and again , the dominant model for organizing digital content throughout the last half - decade has been the stream			0
it 's everywhere -- any site or service that presents content in the familiar , endlessly scrolling chronological list			2
@entity206 's a stream on steroids			0
you know what else is a stream ? live tv ! it comes with the very same qualities that exist in and enliven all the examples above			0
it 's always - on , always - there , always - new			0
you do n't have to do a damn thing except show up			0
how the @entity222 almost killed the internet while synonymous with the age of streaming video , @entity14 is less like a stream and more like a colossal vending machine			1
it offers a plentitude of carefully wrapped choices , each requiring careful consideration			0
ask anyone who 's spent 30 minutes trying to pick a movie , only to give up and see what 's on tv			2
@entity238 , associate director , @entity239 at @entity240 , points out that @entity14 is very much defined by its origins			2
in its earliest incarnation , @entity14 was n't competing with tv ; it was competing with @entity243			1
" @entity14 was a video rental store , " he explains			2
" and its original website was a rental shelf			0
" that 's what gave birth to @entity14 's @entity251 , and countless streaming video services have followed its example			1
as he puts it , with @entity14 " you 're not watching			1
" there are signs that @entity14 is trying to do better			2
it recently tweaked its ui so that the next episode of a tv series starts automatically after you finish one , simulating the always - something - on - next effect of regular tv			0
@entity263 recently argued that @entity14 's new super-specific , algorithmically suggested microgenres are an effort to make itself more tv - like , an attempt to serve up something from its vast archive of second - tier content that you 'll consent to watch , even if you 're not enthralled by it			1
gim me channels but for @entity14 and its ilk to begin eating into those three hours of nightly tv time , it needs proper channels			1
think : a dozen programmed line - ups and an interface to match , so that with one click you can be in the middle of something random from @entity14 's catalog -- something that 's perfectly suited for the ambient entertainment we crave			1
if that 's too radical , just think of it as @entity290 - mode			0
it does n't have to replace @entity14 's library entirely			1
but it should be offered as a complement to it			0
11 must - watch @entity14 movies to stream in 2014 the same goes for @entity295			1
the company 's newest product -- a flatscreen built from the ground up around @entity31 -- offers 1,200 " channels , " from real stations like @entity306 and @entity178 , to services like @entity290 and @entity14 and lesser - known entities like @entity302 and " @entity303			1
" there 's one big problem			0
they 're not really channels at all			0
instead , they 're just apps by another name			0
make them into real , instantaneous video streams , and then you 've got something			0
there might be some dumb reason we ca n't have this			0
perhaps there 's a clause in licensing agreements that forbids @entity14 from packaging this sort of programming ; maybe most viewers do n't yet have the bandwidth necessary for these services to simulate some sort of channel surfing experience			1
nevertheless , if @entity14 truly wants to make itself an indispensable eight - bucks - a - month expense -- or if @entity31 wants to build the standalone tv that can finally break cable 's hegemony -- giving couch potatoes some true channels to dip into is the way to do it			1
i could be wrong , but i suspect there are a lot of people like me out there			0
i never have time for " ghostbusters , " but i always have time for the last 30 minutes of it			0
you can build this open - source car in an hour			0

today 's streaming services like @entity14 do n't offer a passive tv experience
instead of letting you lean back and soak up content , these services require decisions
but we 're still a culture of channel surfers
we *wo* n't order " ghostbusters " on @entity14 , but we 'll watch part of it when it 's on tv
