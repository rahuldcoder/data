-- a federal appeals court has blocked an @entity3 voter - approved measure barring state judges from considering @entity6 and international law in their decisions			1
the three - judge panel at the 10th @entity10 @entity9 upheld an earlier injunction preventing @entity12 from being certified until the free speech questions are resolved			2
the decision tuesday allows a lawsuit brought by @entity6 - @entity10 groups to move ahead to a bench trial			2
" the proposed amendment discriminates among religions , " said the judges			0
" the @entity3 amendment specifically names the target of its discrimination			2
the only religious law mentioned in the amendment is @entity28 law			1
" a federal judge last summer had issued a temporary restraining order in favor of the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , which had sued to nullify the law completely			1
the amendment would require @entity3 courts to " rely on federal and state law when deciding cases " and " forbids courts from considering or using " either international law or @entity6 religious law , known as @entity28 , which the amendment defined as being based on the @entity42 and the teachings of the @entity44			1
in bringing suit , @entity32 argued that the amendment violates the establishment and free - exercise clauses of the @entity50 's guarantee of religious freedom			1
the group 's local leader , @entity52 , has said the amendment passed in november 2010 under a campaign of fear and misinformation about @entity6			0
" this is an important reminder that the @entity60 is the last line of defense against a rising tide of @entity64 bigotry in our society , and we are pleased that the appeals court recognized that fact , " @entity52 told @entity0 after tuesday 's announcement			2
the appeals court said voter initiatives normally should be given great deference by the courts but concluded the @entity3 measure would be applied selectively			1
ballot supporters " do not identify any actual problem the challenged amendment seeks to solve , " said the 37 - page ruling			0
" indeed , they admitted at the preliminary injunction hearing that they did not know of even a single instance where an @entity3 court had applied @entity28 law or used the legal precepts of other nations or cultures , let alone that such applications or uses had resulted in concrete problems in @entity3			1
" state question 755 , also known as the " @entity92 " measure , was approved by a 7 - 3 ratio			2
it was sponsored by @entity95			0
@entity96 and @entity97 , both republicans			0
" the fact that @entity28 law was even considered anywhere in the @entity10 is enough for me " to sign on , @entity97 told @entity0 last year			1
" it should scare anyone that any judge in @entity10 would consider using that as precedent			0
" @entity97 said his concern was compounded by @entity110 justice @entity109 's comments during her confirmation hearings in june 2010 that she would be willing to consider international law when hearing cases before the court			1
as written on the ballot , the measure states it would amend a state constitution section dealing with the state courts , making them " rely on federal and state law " when deciding cases , forbidding them " from considering or using international law " and " from considering or using @entity28			1
" the ballot then briefly described international law , which " deals with the conduct of international organizations and independent nations , such as countries , states and tribes , " and @entity28 , which is " based on two principal sources , the @entity42 and the teaching of @entity44			1
" " shall the proposal be approved ? " the ballot read , instructing voters to respond " yes " if they 're for the proposal and " no " if they 're against it			0
@entity140 , president of the @entity141 of @entity142 , runs the @entity143 at the @entity144 of @entity142			0
he said there are more than 5,000 muslims in the city			0
while there are no exact numbers for the @entity6 population in the state , it is not among the larger communities , said @entity154 of @entity32			1
" it 's just fear - mongering ; it 's nothing , " @entity140 told @entity0			0
" what 's @entity28 law have to do with @entity3 ? " the @entity3 controversy stems from a @entity162 legal case in which a @entity6 woman went to a family court asking for a restraining order against her spouse , claiming he had raped her repeatedly			1
the judge ruled against her , saying that her husband was abiding by his @entity6 beliefs regarding spousal duties			2
the decision was later overruled by an appellate court , but the case sparked a nationwide firestorm			0
the issue spread to @entity3 , prompting the ballot initiative			0
tuesday 's ruling deals only with the injunction stopping certification and enforcement of 755			0
there was no indication when the federal district judge would hear the larger merits of the @entity3 case and issue a ruling , but that could be some months away			2
the losing side could then try again at the federal appeals court , then possibly to the @entity10 @entity110			1
the appeals case is @entity192 ( 10 - 6273 )			0
