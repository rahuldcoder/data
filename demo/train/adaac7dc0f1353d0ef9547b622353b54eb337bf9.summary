-- @entity1 extended his @entity3 series lead to 20 points after winning the @entity5 for the second time in his top - level motorcycling career			1
the @entity8 rider started sunday 's race from second on the grid , but outshone @entity12 's polesitter @entity13 as the reigning world champion lost more ground in the overall standings after finishing fourth			1
it was @entity1 's third victory in five races this season , and second in a row after winning at @entity23 last month			1

@entity13 sets pace in @entity36 qualifying " i 'm really happy with this victory as it was a very tough weekend			2
we performed a lot better than yesterday as in qualifying it was very hot , " said the 2010 world champion , who had to make up ground after @entity28 took the early lead			1
" the grip on the track after the rain this morning was also not so great			0
i followed @entity28 and watched him , he slowed his pace and eventually made a mistake so i was able to pass him then give it full throttle			2
" @entity28 was disappointed despite finishing on the podium at @entity25 for the eighth time , being 10 points behind teammate @entity13 in third overall			1
" a second place is always a second , but i really wanted to win today , i can not feel happy , " he said			0
" i tried to attack but with 10 laps remaining i could n't keep the pace			0
it was hard to control the bike on braking and in the exit of the corners , so i was defensive because i knew my corner speed was not so good			0
i made a mistake and i had a big wheelie , so @entity1 got past me and i could n't follow him			2
" @entity13 , who plans to retire at the end of this season , was also disappointed -- having won the previous four races held at @entity73 circuits			1
" we gave it everything at the end but we just did n't have the pace , especially in the beginning with the hard tire , " the @entity74 said			0
" with the performance we had during the weekend we expected to be a little stronger throughout the race			0
" @entity31 's @entity84 teammate @entity83 was fifth ahead of @entity73 's @entity86 and seven - time world champion @entity87 of @entity88			1
@entity90 's @entity89 was eighth on a @entity12 , with @entity88 's @entity92 ninth and fellow @entity94 @entity93 10th			1
@entity93 dropped from second early in the race , which was a big blow after qualifying in fourth on saturday			2
" i just made one mistake in the race and blew our chance , " the 27 - year - old said			2
" we were going good in the beginning but i was getting impatient with @entity28			0
" he was holding me up but i could n't make the pass on the straight so i had to go for it on the brakes and unfortunately got out onto the edge of the track			0
i got up and we got back into it and our pace was pretty good , unfortunately it was too late to get back to the front			0
