-- @entity5 lost her spouse in 2009 , her grief compounded by an estate tax bill much larger than other married couples would have to pay			1
because her decades - long partner was also a woman , the federal government in legal terms did not recognize the same - sex marriage , even though their home state of @entity12 did			1
" i was devastated by the loss of the great love of my life , and i was also very sick , then had to deal with pulling together enough money to pay for the taxes , " @entity5 , 83 , told @entity0			2
" and it was deeply upsetting			0
" that fundamental unfairness as @entity5 and her supporters see it , is at the center of legal fight now awaiting action at the @entity26 @entity25			1
victory for lesbian , years after her longtime partner 's death the justices will meet privately friday for a closed - door conference to decide if they will accept any of 10 pending appeals , essentially over whether a fundamental constitutional right for gays and lesbians to marry exists			1
if they agree to hear the issue , oral arguments would be likely be held in march with a ruling by late june			2
the political , social , and legal stakes of this long - simmering debate will once again put the high court at the center of national attention , a contentious encore to their summer ruling upholding the massive health care reform law championed by president @entity49			1
earlier this month , voters in @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53 approved same - sex marriage , adding to the six states and the @entity52 that already have done so			1
@entity57 voters also rejected an effort to ban such unions through a constitutional amendment			0
is there a national consensus ? as more states legalize same - sex marriage , one of the key questions the justices may be forced to address is whether a national consensus now exists supporting the idea of expanding an " equal protection " right of marriage to homosexuals			1
three separate issues confront the justices , who are likely to only accept only one for review in coming months			2
these include federal benefits , state benefits and state referendums			0
the @entity83 , or @entity83 , is a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes , marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman			2
that means federal tax , @entity91 , pension , and bankruptcy benefits , and family medical leave protections -- do not apply to gay and lesbian couples , such as @entity5 and her late partner @entity5			1
federal appeals court strikes down @entity83 this appeal from @entity100 asks whether a state that prohibits same - sex marriage may also deny same - sex couples marital benefits if one of the partners is a state employee , when other state workers in opposite - sex marriages enjoy government benefits			1
on referendums , the @entity111 high court had earlier concluded same - sex marriage was legal , but the 2008 voter - approved @entity114 abolished it			1
if the high court accepts this appeal , it would likely not decide whether same - sex marriage is a constitutional right , but only whether a state can revoke that right through referendum once it has already been recognized			1
" the justices are almost certainly going to take up the question of the constitutionality of the @entity83 , " said @entity121 , publisher of @entity122 and a top @entity52 attorney			2
" the real question is whether they 'll step into @entity111 's @entity114 and the ruling there that @entity111 discriminated unconstitutionally when it granted a right to same sex - marriage and then took it away			1
it 's a tossup on whether they 'll hear that case			0
" who will represent @entity26 in any court case complicating matters is just who will defend the @entity83 law before the justices			2
traditionally that role would fall to the @entity144 's solicitor general office			0
but @entity49 , in an election - year stunner , said in may he supports same - sex marriages			1
the president had already ordered attorney general @entity148 not to defend the federal law in court			0
that left @entity152 , led by speaker @entity153 , @entity154 , to step in after the @entity144 refused to participate			0
they have hired top @entity52 attorney @entity156 -- himself a former solicitor general -- to make the arguments to keep the law in place , at least until lawmakers decide otherwise			0
@entity156 said a congressionally mandated , uniform standard to define marriage for federal purposes is both proper and practical , since different states have different laws defining the limits of marriage			2
" @entity83 does not bar or invalidate any marriages but leaves states free to decide whether they will recognize same - sex marriage , " @entity156 told the court in a legal brief			1
" rather , @entity83 merely reaffirmed and codified the traditional definition of marriage : what @entity177 itself has always meant and what courts and the executive branch have always understood it to mean -- in using those words : a traditional male - female couple			2
" the law does not prohibit states from allowing same - sex marriages , but it also does not force states to recognize them from other states			1
most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers , who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans , and other benefits			0
many other states , including @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 , have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples -- a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law			2
but other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages			0
@entity111 's prop 8 is the only such referendum that revoked the right after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it			0
in february , a federal appeals court in @entity218 ruled the measure unconstitutional			0
timeline : same - sex marriage @entity25 could offer final word by patiently letting legislatures and the voters decide the social and practical implications of same - sex marriage over the past decade , the high court is now poised to perhaps offer the final word on the tricky constitutional questions			1
the split 5 - 4 conservative - liberal bench has the option of ruling broadly or narrowly -- perhaps taking a series of incremental cases over a period years , building political momentum and public confidence in the process			1
@entity5 is one of more than a dozen plaintiffs involved in the current @entity83 appeals before the high court			1
she and @entity243 , a psychologist , had been a devoted couple in @entity12 's @entity244 for more than 40 years , before marrying in @entity245 in 2007			0
@entity12 did not allow same - sex marriages to be performed in the state when @entity5 and @entity243 wed , but did recognize the out - of - state license			1
@entity12 's legislature last year approved same - sex marriage			1
@entity5 , a retired computer systems programmer , wants the $ 363,053 in added estate taxes she was forced to pay the @entity254			2
she said the federal government considers her relationship with @entity243 as little more than " girlfriends , " something she called an " incredible indignation			0
" " i would like to receive my money back			0
@entity12 accepted my marriage as a marriage , " she told @entity0			0
" and i believe , and the @entity144 and the president agree with me , that the @entity83 law is unconstitutional			0
it discriminates against us for absolutely no value to the country			0
and we 'd like to see that defeated altogether			0
i 'd like other people not to go through what i went through			0
