-- the difficult question of where @entity3 's body would be laid to rest appears to have been settled			1
the remains of the slain @entity11 bombings suspect have been entombed thanks to a " courageous and compassionate individual ( who ) came forward , " police in @entity7 , @entity8 , said thursday			1
police did not say where the remains were entombed but did say that they are " no longer in the city of @entity7 , " where the body had been at a funeral home while a relative and officials tried to determine what to do			1
the city 's police chief " thanks the community that provided the burial site , " police said in a written statement			2
@entity3 's mother , meanwhile , appeared confused by the announcement			1
speaking to @entity0 from @entity28 by phone thursday evening , @entity27 said she did n't know whether her son was buried or where			2
" i have no idea what is going on , " she said			0
" they say he is buried , and then he is not			0
( i hear it 's been ) authorized , and then it is not done yet			0
" i am really sad , really dead inside			0
" @entity3 's uncle @entity40 confirmed thursday afternoon that his nephew is buried outside of @entity8 and that he has not told @entity3 's parents where			1
he also said that there was no second autopsy : " i did not do that , i did not do anything			0
" what would happen to the body of the man who , along with his younger brother , @entity51 , was accused of setting off two deadly explosions at the @entity11 on april 15 had been a nearly monthlong puzzle			2
what did suspect 's widow know ? the body of @entity3 , killed in a police pursuit days after the bombings , went unclaimed for nearly two weeks			1
the funeral home in @entity7 -- about 40 miles west of downtown @entity61 -- eventually accepted the remains , and @entity40 worked with the funeral home on what to do next			2
@entity40 asked several cemeteries , including a @entity67 site in @entity68 , @entity69 , to take his nephew 's remains			0
@entity72 , whose mosque oversees that cemetery , said @entity3 's remains are not in that city			1
@entity78 manager @entity77 said @entity72 assured him that @entity3 is not there			0
