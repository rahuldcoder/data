-- as a frequent visitor to @entity3 , i have never seen the country as deeply polarized along ideological , social , and political lines as it is today -- horizontally and vertically			1
the current fight pits the @entity7 and their @entity9 allies against the military - backed government and a sizeable segment of @entity3 who rally around the flag and populism			1
religious frame of reference is pitted against a deeply entrenched nationalist identity that is centuries - old			0
this fierce struggle over hegemony and the future identity of the @entity3 state has been invested with cultural and existential overtones			1
both camps view their rivalry as life - and - death and are locked in a deadly confrontation , a clash that has killed more than 1,000 people , including dozens of members of the security forces and injured thousands			0
on sunday the @entity3 government acknowledged that 36 @entity32 died in its custody after an attempted breakout and a day later more than two dozen off - duty police recruits were killed by gunmen in the restive @entity37			1
according to the @entity38 , the police recruits were returning from leave to their jobs in the border town of @entity42 when militants ordered the recruits out of two minibuses and forced them to lie on the ground before shooting them			0
the recent bloodletting is the most violent episode in @entity3 modern history and shows an unraveling of its social fabric , a rupture with the past			1
in contrast to neighboring @entity56 countries , such as @entity57 and @entity58 , with blood soaked history , @entity3 is one of the least violent societies in the @entity63 and @entity3 are the most peace - loving people			2
there is a real danger that bloodshed will beget more bloodshed and that unless checked @entity3 will be engulfed in politically - driven violence			0
there are signs pointing to the military - backed government continuing its clampdown on the @entity7 and possibly attempting a widespread purge , including banning the 85 - year - old @entity9 organization			1
early tuesday , @entity3 authorities arrested @entity7 chief @entity80 , escalating a crackdown that has seen the arrests of dozens of the group 's top leaders and more than 1,000 of its followers ( in its prolonged confrontation with the @entity7 , even the @entity78 regime refrained from arresting the top leader or general guide out of restraint )			1
interim prime minister @entity91 even suggested outlawing the @entity7 and told reporters over the weekend : " there will be no reconciliation with those whose hands have been stained with blood and who turned weapons against the state and its institutions			2
" a decision to ban the @entity7 that would have serious repercussions on @entity3 's future			1
it would pour gasoline on a raging fire and deepen and widen the ideological and social rift that already exists			0
it would represent a hard blow to the fragile democratic experience in @entity3 , a severe setback to the institutionalization of democracy			2
the @entity7 has millions of followers and can not be politically eradicated by a stroke of pen or the barrel of a gun			2
there will be no institutionalization of democracy without the @entity7 , the biggest and oldest mainstream religiously based @entity9 movement in the @entity63			2
moreover , a persecuted brotherhood whose leaders are either in prison or underground might tempt its young followers to take arms against state and society , as some supporters retaliated violently , following the 21 police stations and scores of coptic churches burnt already last week			1
unless steps are taken to defuse the escalating crisis , @entity3 will likely descend into long - term bloodshed and perpetual instability			0
we may be in for a repeat of the violent insurgency seen in @entity3 from 1992 until 1998 , an insurgency that killed and injured thousands of @entity3			0
priority must be given to ending the killing and bloodshed and beginning the healing and reconciliation process , a complex task given the country 's deepening and widening polarization and the absence of a credible , neutral third force			0
the international community 's role is pivotal , although excessive intervention by the @entity161 powers would embolden the hardliners within the military - security apparatus and allow them to stirrup hyper nationalist sentiments			0
beyond the legal and moral pressure that the international community could exert on @entity3 military rulers , there is an urgent need for mediation and stopping the country 's descent into all - out confrontation			2
of all powers , the @entity175 , along with the @entity174 , is the best equipped to assist the @entity3 people and to bridge the divide between the two warring camps			1
unlike the @entity180 which is deeply mistrusted by @entity3 of all walks of life because of its intimate ties with the military and @entity3 rulers , the @entity175 is seen as neutral and trustworthy			1
although its previous mission failed to produce a breakthrough , the recent escalation after @entity7 camps were broken up , the @entity175 , in coordination with the @entity174 and the @entity180 , must redouble its efforts and impress on the interim government to take concrete steps and confidence - building measures to defuse the crisis , such as stopping the arrests of @entity7 leaders and releasing others			1
political talks would follow on ways and means to assure the @entity32 that they would not be excluded from participation in the transitional road map			0
there is no guarantee of success and a high probability of failure			0
nevertheless , the world community can not afford to remain passive in the face of the unfolding bloodbath in @entity3 and the inherent risks to regional stability and international peace			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			0

@entity216 : @entity3 is polarized along ideological , social , and political lines
government 's clampdown on @entity7 will *damage* democracy , he says
@entity216 : arrest of leaders could force young followers to take arms against state and society
@entity175 and @entity174 are best equipped to assist @entity3 , *argues* @entity216 *due* to distrust of @entity180
