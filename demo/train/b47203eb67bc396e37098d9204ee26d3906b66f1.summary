@entity0 -- i am pretty sure i met the next leader of the conservative movement during a three - day confab of activists that wrapped up saturday here in the nation 's capital			1
i definitely shook hands with a future congressman or maybe even a governor			2
maybe it was the 14 - year - old conservative wonder - kid @entity15 , who champions " conservatism based on reality " and was a prominent speaker at the @entity17			2
seriously , 14 years old and he is talking about " conservatism based on reality			2
" he has even written a book about it : " @entity23			2
" when i was 14 , i was trying to learn how to hit a fastball			2
if you follow baseball , you know that spring training has started in @entity28 and @entity29 , and i am writing this column from @entity0			0
i wonder if @entity15 can hit a fastball ? perhaps it was the 18 - year - old freshman from @entity33 , the 27 - year - old senior from @entity35 , or the 24 - year - old recent graduate of @entity37 who now helps conservative and libertarian students maintain their rights on largely liberal college campuses			0
without a question , it was the youth , the next generation of conservatives , who emerged from the @entity17 meeting as the @entity46			1
the @entity47 , which put on this exhaustive three - day program , estimates that more than 10,000 people attended and 60 to 70 percent were under the age of 30			0
it was like @entity52 for @entity53			0
i even got a bottle opener and a keg cup from the @entity53 booth			0
the slogan on the bottle opener : " the @entity58 on @entity59			0
" full coverage of @entity17 meeting on @entity1 political ticker the future looks bright , or at the very least , there is hope in the future for the conservative movement			1
but unlike in my household , it was n't all about the kids			0
there were other winners and losers in my mind , so i thought i would share them with you			1
winner : @entity77 @entity78 rep. @entity77 was the overwhelming choice of attendees to be the 2012 @entity53 presidential nominee in the nonscientific , yet much discussed , @entity83			1
@entity77 's supporters were out in force each day of the conference , handing out leaflets and emphasizing the @entity78 congressman 's disdain for the @entity90			1
he received huge applause during his late friday afternoon speech , but when he was announced as the winner of the @entity83 the audience erupted in boos			1
why ? well , let 's take a look at a loser			2
loser : @entity17 straw poll admittedly , for political junkies like me , you can be tempted to put too much emphasis on a straw poll			1
but when there is a chance to survey 10,000 -- that 's right , 10,000 -- political activists , it is hard not to get a little excited to see the results			1
alas , that is not what happened this weekend			2
sure , there were 10,000 attendees , but only 2,395 participated in this unscientific survey			0
you do the math. not quite the snapshot i was looking for			0
what we learned this past weekend -- ok , we already knew it -- is that @entity77 has a very loyal following			2
the @entity78 congressman has already proven that he can run a national campaign , but can he win the @entity53 presidential nomination ? i 'm not sure all of his views resonate with @entity131 primary voters			0
but i have to admit , i will be there again next year when the results are announced			0
winner : @entity135 he was the belle of the ball at @entity17			1
the former @entity29 @entity139 speaker was praised for challenging gov. @entity140 , who is popular with the party establishment , for the @entity53 @entity144 nomination and refusing to bow to pressure to abandon his bid			0
@entity135 kicked off the conference with a speech that hit all of the boilerplate conservative themes , which drew the audience to its feet several times			1
@entity135 's wisest move was placing a form soliciting volunteers and donations on every seat in the ballroom before people took their seats			1
loser : @entity163 a tough decision to tag the former @entity166 governor with this brand , but @entity17 was her crowd and she was n't present			1
will it hurt her politically ? no. but she missed out on an opportunity to appear before a very large and very friendly audience			0
instead , she allowed a half dozen or so other potential candidates the opportunity to try to convince attendees they have the best chance of defeating president @entity176 in 2012 , without ever having to explicitly say it			0
and there is no doubt in my mind , the adults who forked out $ 750 for the all - inclusive three - day pass and students who paid $ 25 for the conference would have bought another copy of @entity163 's book , even if they already had one on their bedside table			1
winner : @entity192 the former @entity139 speaker entered the @entity17 conference from a distant door up a staircase , halfway across the cavernous room from the podium			1
the " @entity200 " anthem , " @entity199 , " bellowed from the sound system as @entity202 made his way through the electrified crowd			0
it was almost one of those " wow ! " moments			0
winner : @entity209 the former @entity211 senator is being singled out for his decision to shake it up a little bit during his speech			2
how did he do it ? simply			0
@entity209 delivered an abbreviated speech and then took questions from the audience			0
he did n't exactly have the best time slot , saturday at 8:30 a.m. even i was bleary - eyed			0
yet the former @entity211 senator had a pretty good showing and offered up a mea culpa to the attendees for supporting sen. @entity225 's re-election in 2004			2
@entity226 switched to the @entity227 last year			1
and @entity209 did n't dance around the fact that he is considering a @entity139 bid			0
loser : social conservatives this still influential wing of the conservative movement was well represented at @entity17 this year , but the immediacy of some of their top issues -- abortion , same - sex marriage and " @entity239 " in the military -- just was n't a major part of the larger discussion			1
instead , these activists were primarily talking about fiscal discipline , lower taxes and limited government			0
and @entity247 , a gay conservative organization , was one of the cosponsors of @entity17			0
winner : @entity131 there has been much speculation that @entity254 activists will actually hurt the @entity131 because this new , decentralized political movement will field candidates to run in the midterm elections			1
a third - party conservative candidate introduced into a race will actually help the @entity227 , because it will split the @entity53 vote			1
remember the @entity262 special congressional election won by a @entity263 in 2009 , because of a third - party conservative candidate ? while that may happen on a scattered basis in 2010 , there was widespread acknowledgment that this is not in the conservative movement 's best interests			2
these activists want to see conservative candidates such as @entity135 run in the primaries , but come november , i do n't think you are going to see a slew of formidable third - party candidates			1
winner : @entity227 huh ? what ? are you crazy ? well , i am definitely a little crazy , but this was an easy call			1
why ? @entity227 got to see firsthand that conservatives are no longer lying flat on their backs after what was then thought to be a knockout blow that @entity176 delivered in the 2008 elections .			1
