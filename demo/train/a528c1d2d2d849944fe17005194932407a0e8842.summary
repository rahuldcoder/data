-- federal agents are conducting a criminal investigation that could affect the trial of @entity6 and four others accused of plotting the 2001 terrorist attacks , @entity2 lawyers told a @entity10 military court monday in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the lawyers , in a filing with the court monday , acknowledged for the first time that the inquiry existed but also requested more time to determine its scope and how it could affect the planned 9/11 trial			1
that request came after preliminary proceedings for the planned military commissions trial were halted recently when defense attorneys for defendant @entity24 said a member of the defense team was approached by @entity28 agents and asked to become a confidential informant in an ongoing probe			1
defense lawyers said they believed it was related to what military prosecutors said was the unauthorized publication in january of a manifesto written by @entity6			2
the defense viewed the @entity28 's involvement as causing a potential conflict of interest that could prompt defense lawyers to resign			1
such a move could force even more delays of a trial not expected to start until next year , 14 years after the terror attacks			0
in the monday public filing , a special team of @entity2 lawyers set up specifically to handle the dispute said only that the ongoing @entity28 " preliminary investigation " includes " classified information " but has nothing to do with the publication of the @entity6 manifesto			2
the lawyers said that they provided more detailed information in a separate filing with the court but that document would not be made public to preserve the investigation			0
" contrary to the apparent belief of defense counsel ... and the ( military ) commission ...			0
the @entity28 preliminary investigation does not pertain to the disclosure of mr. @entity6 's written communications to third parties , " the public court filing said			0
the government lawyers asked the military court for 30 days to provide " more complete " information to the military court to address the conflict claims .			0

the @entity28 is conducting a criminal investigation that may affect the 9/11 trial , lawyers said
defense lawyers for @entity24 said the @entity28 asked a team member to be an informant
the defense said the inquiry could be a conflict of interest ; *justice* lawyers *disagree*
@entity85 , @entity6 and 3 others will be tried in @entity11
