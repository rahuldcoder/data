-- it 's not the way most @entity3 spent @entity4 weekend , but then again , most @entity3 are n't @entity5			1
and that 's the potential problem that will be leveraged against him in the battle for the @entity9			0
the former @entity11 governor and likely @entity13 presidential nominee spent the past few days with his family at his beach house in expensive and exclusive @entity16 , @entity17			1
that 's the same three - bedroom home , purchased for $ 12 million four years ago , that has made headlines over the past couple of years after reports of plans for a major remodeling and expansion			0
the home was in the media spotlight again just a few weeks ago , amid reports that the proposed renovations , which would quadruple the size of the structure , included an auto elevator for a four - car garage			0
@entity5 's @entity13 presidential campaign released a photo on friday of @entity5 and wife @entity35 decorating @entity4 eggs with their grandchildren			1
on sunday , @entity5 's son @entity38 tweeted out a photo of the family taking part in an @entity42 on the expansive lawn belonging to their next - door neighbor			1
also over the weekend , a photo of @entity5 walking across the beach , wearing a wetsuit and holding a boogie board , made its way onto the political blogs			1
a day later , in response , son @entity38 , who 's seen in the beach picture with his father , tweeted " water temp was low 60s			0
i was freezing in my full - length wetsuit			0
guess my dad was just happy to be out there			0
" are the photos much ado about nothing ? or are they an example of a candidate who might be tone - deaf to how most of the public actually lives			0
in 2004 , opponents used images of then - @entity72 presidential nominee sen. @entity71 of @entity11 windsurfing to tag him an elitist , lumping in windsurfing with some of his other expensive pastimes , including skiing and flying himself between vacation homes			0
but boogie - boarding is not an expensive hobby , and a source close to the @entity5 campaign says it does n't see a problem with the photos , and that like millions of other @entity3 , @entity5 spent the holiday weekend with his family			1
" we had 11 of our grandkids staying with us and three of my boys and three of their , of course , their spouses , " @entity5 said monday , describing his weekend in an interview on former @entity87 governor and former @entity13 presidential candidate @entity89 's radio program			1
" we had the easter egg roll over the neighbor 's lawn			0
he has a big lawn we use			0
we made @entity4 eggs , we went swimming and surfing in the water			2
" @entity5 made millions at @entity105 , the investment firm he founded in 1984 , and at @entity106 , a management firm he eventually ran			2
according to a financial disclosure form released by his campaign last year , @entity5 has assets totaling $ 190 million to $ 250 million in value			1
he made $ 42.7 million over the past two years and paid $ 6.2 million in taxes , according to tax documents released earlier this year by his campaign			0
@entity5 and @entity114 filed a joint 1040 reporting $ 21.7 million in 2010 income and $ 3 million in federal taxes			2
they also said their 2011 income was $ 21 million and the tax bill was $ 3.2 million			0
besides the beach home in @entity16 , @entity5 owns a property along @entity123 in @entity124			1
he used to own a multimillion - dollar ski home in exclusive @entity127 , @entity128			0
the " rich guy " and " @entity133 " images were issues for @entity5 when he first ran for the @entity13 presidential nomination four years ago			1
this time around , @entity5 has been more casual , often shedding the suit for a less buttoned - up look			2
but he was attacked earlier in this primary season by rival @entity13 candidates , including @entity138 and @entity139 , over his wealth			2
according to a @entity0 / @entity142 poll released two weeks ago , @entity13 nationwide said that @entity139 cares more about average @entity3 than @entity5 by 47 % to 34 %			1
on the campaign trail , @entity5 talks bluntly about his financial status , saying , " i 've been very successful and i 'm not going to apologize for that			1
" and @entity13 strategist @entity146 says the worst thing @entity5 can do is be insincere			1
" the worst thing @entity5 can do is pretend to be what he 's not			1
we all know he 's a wealthy man			0
he 's a successful man			0
he 's made his money			0
he does n't need to apologize about it and the best he can do is embrace it , accept it , and not be awkward about it , " @entity151 told @entity0			0
" it 's part of a package deal and -- let 's face it -- we live in @entity3			2
in @entity3 , being successful and being wealthy is a good thing , not something we resent , " she added			1
another @entity13 strategist said @entity5 's success should be admired			1
" the fact of the matter today , though , is that the @entity3 people are hurting			2
they 're worried about their financial future , they 're worried about their kids ' financial future , and they look at @entity5 , who is a self - made guy and very successful , very successful over a number of different enterprises , and i think he 's the kind of guy that the @entity3 people can look at and say we need this kind of success as a country , " said @entity166 , who served as political director for both the @entity168 and the @entity169 and who ran @entity5 's 2008 operations in @entity172 , but who says he is neutral this cycle			1
will photos of @entity5 on the beach , or at the @entity16 beach house , be used by the @entity194 or the @entity197 re-election campaign ? stay tuned			1
but @entity72 are already making an issue of @entity5 's wealth through his opposition to the so - called " @entity201 , " a push by the president and congressional democrats to get those making more than $ 1 million a year to pay a higher percentage of their income in federal income and payroll taxes than those who make less			2
the bill is named for billionaire investor @entity213 , who has argued that it 's unfair that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary			0
the measure would require that millionaires pay at least 30 % of their income in taxes			0
the legislation is opposed by most republicans , and the @entity197 re-election team is targeting @entity5 for his opposition			2
" @entity5 supports tax policies that reward people like him , and now he 's just trying to obscure just how much he would benefit , " said @entity197 re-election campaign manager @entity224 , in a conference call monday			1
" ... our message to @entity5 is simple : if you do n't have anything to hide , release your taxes just like every other candidate for president			2
" @entity0 senior correspondent @entity236 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 spends @entity4 weekend at his beach house in @entity16 , @entity17
will pictures showing him in the posh *environment* be a political *liability* ?
his campaign staff says it does n't see a problem : he spent a weekend with his family
@entity13 strategist : " in @entity3 , being successful and being wealthy is a good thing "
