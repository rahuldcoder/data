-- @entity1 is a 21st - century warrior			1
the armor has come off , the helmet lays on the side of the field			2
gone are his gridiron days -- this is rugby sevens and it 's as fast as it is brutal			1
" we 're modern - day gladiators , " the 27 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity12 show			2
" we are out there fighting , we are brotherhood , together , we 're teammates			2
we hit each other for one another and we have each others ' backs , so i think that sums it up very much			0
" @entity1 knows all about being in a battle -- after an impressive college career at @entity24 , he was tipped for big things when he was drafted by the @entity26			1
but after failing to make the grade and with his life at a crossroads , he moved back to @entity30 where a chance glance at a television changed everything			1
" i just happened to be in a diner and i saw the rugby on tv , " he said			1
" and then , right then and there i called my agent and told him , this is the sport i want to do			0
" @entity40 was n't working out at the time and i did n't want to go into the corporate 9 - 5 just yet			0
" i felt like i still had athletic bones in me			0
so i saw it and i was like , you know , it involves a lot of things that football does ; running , tackling , hitting			0
just using your speed and physicality			0
" so i called up my agent , told him to get in touch with the @entity54 coach , and then from there i was welcomed to try out with his summer club team , and then from the club team i went to nationals , and then from there got invited to the @entity54 camp			1
" since making the switch in 2010 , @entity1 has not looked back , becoming an integral part of the @entity54 team -- which is seeking to break into the sport 's top - 10 rankings -- despite his late entry into the game			1
but while some of the skills he gained in gridiron have helped him adapt , @entity1 still ca n't get over how different the game is from the one he witnessed in the comfort of that @entity30 diner			1
" it was definitely appealing on tv but in real life it was more than i expected , " he explained			0
" the fitness levels necessary was beyond my imagination			0
i ran track and played football in college at the collegiate level , and coming off of the rugby pitch you 're more drained and more tired than any other sport i 've participated in			1
" i 'd say football has the hardest hit because you wear a helmet and shoulder pads -- people think they 're invincible			0
" but it 's going to hurt on the rugby pitch as well because you do n't have any padding			2
it 's flesh to flesh , so whatever you work out and whatever you have , whatever @entity98 's given to you and whatever you make in the gym is going to help you out on the pitch			2
" so it 's imperative that you work out , you lift and go out there with your best birthday suit on			0
" one of the biggest differences @entity1 encountered was the speed of the game and the levels of concentration			1
sevens is a non-stop sport , with games divided into seven - minute halves -- a world away from the stop - start nature of the @entity114			1
" in football it 's really just three or four seconds of concentration , " he said			0
" but in rugby it 's the full seven minutes so you 're hitting someone here , then you have to get up , then you might have to hit the next person who has the ball -- it 's just continual play			2
" whereas in football you have water breaks , you have timeouts , tv timeouts and then you go from offense to defense and vice versa			0
" you have to be skilled in both attack and defense in rugby , which is pretty different from football , where you might just focus on offense or you might just focus on defense			2
" while his friends and family might not have caught up yet with all the new rules and changes , @entity1 says he has been given a huge amount of support following his decision			1
with the sevens circuit set to arrive in @entity145 on january 24 , the winger is hoping the tournament will capture the imagination of the locals -- although he 's already looking forward to a night out in " @entity149			1
" " the vegas tournament is great , " he said			0
" i mean it 's vegas -- what more do you need ? " what better attraction do you need to get out there and go ? " we have a great following in the @entity54 and everybody loves to go to @entity145 , so it 's a really good tournament			1
it 's one of my best			0
