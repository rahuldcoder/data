suddenly the phrase is on everyone 's lips			1
from president @entity6 to rising @entity8 star sen. @entity7 to right - wing television hosts @entity10 and @entity11			2
as if by magic , everybody 's for it after six years of ducking and using reform as a political wedge issue -- everybody wants to get it done			1
but what exactly is it ? what kinds of changes will it entail , and what will they mean for @entity25 ? after more than 10 years of on - and - off debate in @entity29 , the most important piece of the puzzle is still rarely discussed and poorly understood			2
@entity6 often talks about reform without even mentioning it			1
it never came up on the campaign trail			2
it 's not what brought @entity36 out to vote in record numbers			1
and although it 's likely to be included in the framework for reform expected to be released monday by a bipartisan group of senators , the concept gets very little attention from the media , @entity47 - or spanish - language			1
@entity48 : under deportation , above fear what 's the most important piece of comprehensive immigration reform you never heard of ? it 's fixing the legal system so it works for the future -- for immigrants and the @entity25 economy			1
many @entity25 think reform is about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already living in the @entity25			1
many have been here for years and have put down roots			2
we 're not going to deport them -- not even the harshest restrictionists think that 's practical			1
nor are most likely to go " home " voluntarily , no matter how difficult we make their lives with tough enforcement			1
for the overwhelming majority , @entity25 is home by now			2
and they are sure to be the most contentious issue when the immigration debate resumes in months to come			1
news : possible compromise on immigration reform takes shape but most contentious is not the same as most important			1
we all must ask : what created this problem in the first place ? exactly what is it about the broken immigration system that produced this vast underground world of workers and families -- a population the size of @entity93 ? the root cause : for less - skilled foreigners who want to come to work legally in the @entity25 , there is no " line " -- no available visas			1
the two existing programs for low - skilled temporary workers are for seasonal labor only : farmhands , landscaping crews , summer and winter resort workers			2
and there are virtually no permanent visas to be had for unskilled workers			1
there simply is no avenue for an uneducated @entity110 unless he has family members living legally in the @entity25 who can sponsor him for a family visa			0
many , if not most , of the 11 million already here would have preferred to enter the country legally if that were possible			0
but they and others like them have no lawful option			0
this would n't be a problem if we did n't need immigrant workers			0
and we 're going to need them increasingly as the economy recovers			1
this is n't because @entity25 workers are somehow lacking or inadequate			0
on the contrary , for the most part , it 's because @entity25 are doing better than in decades past			1
we 're becoming better educated and aspiring to the kinds of jobs for which our better educations prepare us			0
news : @entity8 needs to back immigration overhaul , lawmakers say in 1960 , half of the native - born men in the labor force were high school dropouts happy to do physically demanding , low - skilled work			2
today , less than 10 % of the native - born men in the labor force are high school dropouts			0
and meanwhile , far from shrinking , the demand for low - skilled labor is growing over time			0
in 1955 , for example , 25 cents of every dollar spent on food was spent in a restaurant			0
today , the figure is nearly 50 cents			0
and one of the fastest - growing occupations in @entity25 is home health aide			0
but very few @entity25 with high school diplomas aspire to careers as busboys or home health aides			0
and they should n't -- their educations equip them to do more productive work , making better wages and contributing more to the economy			2
no , we do n't need as many immigrant workers in a down economy -- and far fewer want to come to the @entity25 when jobs are scarce			2
but we still need some , and they need a legal way to get here			0
and whatever program we create needs to be flexible , growing in good times to accommodate rising labor needs and shrinking back in down times when demand subsides			0
do n't get me wrong : the goal of reform is not to increase the overall number of unskilled immigrants entering the country			1
what 's needed is to end illegal immigration by creating ways for needed workers to come legally -- creating worker visas and establishing a system that allows employers who ca n't find enough willing and able @entity25 to connect easily and quickly with lawful immigrants			1
this is not just an economic imperative			0
without it , there can be no successful immigration law enforcement			1
even the best , most effective enforcement is no match for the dynamism of the @entity25 economy			1
as long as there are jobs available , foreigners will want to come to work here			0
and if we want to prevent them from coming illegally , we need to create lawful alternatives			0
finding a solution for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already in the country addresses the mistakes of the past but fixes nothing going forward			0
unless we create ways for the immigrants of the future to enter legally , we 're going to find ourselves in exactly the same predicament a decade or two down the road -- wondering what to do about 10 or 20 million unauthorized immigrants living among us but beyond the rule of law			0
the only way to prevent this : a legal immigration system that works			2
now if only @entity6 would mention it			0
then we 'd have some hope of getting somewhere as the debate resumes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227			1

@entity227 : immigration reform in air , but focus tends to be on the *undocumented*
she says for real reform , discussion must be on providing unskilled worker visas
she says there 's no way to " get in line " if no visas are available
@entity227 : in dynamic economy , entry will always *outpace* enforcement
