-- in a presidential campaign laden with historic twists , the biggest shock may be yet to come : with three weeks to go , the first of two remaining debates tonight , and most @entity7 yet to cast their ballots , the final surprise may be that there are no surprises left			1
this campaign for president may be over			2
there is a good chance that the @entity16 debate was the watershed that carries this election to its conclusion			2
if so , @entity20 has only himself to blame			2
yes , the polls show a very close race , but the momentum has belonged to @entity24 since his superior showing in the first debate			1
long ago , @entity27 displayed a heartbreaking lack of faith in its candidate and his prospects			0
abandon hope , all ye who campaign here ; they never tried to get @entity20 re-elected president			1
constrained by the paucity of their achievements and the poverty of their ideas , perhaps they felt they had no choice : we ca n't win , they concluded , but maybe we can stop the other guy from beating us			0
@entity20 's thin campaign only tried to stop his opponent from winning			1
get instant updates on the second presidential debate on @entity0 's live blog until this last month , the president 's " this is a one - man race " marketing philosophy was working -- but only with the assistance of an opponent who ran as if his shoes were tied together			2
@entity24 had allowed @entity20 to paint him as an unacceptable alternative			1
he also helped the president with 47 % of the brushstrokes			0
@entity64 's inability to introduce their candidate as a good and decent man has frustrated @entity24 's core supporters , who 've longed to hear more about their man 's munificence and compassion			2
@entity24 's campaign seemed equally unable to acquaint voters with the transformational business leader who , as @entity75 describes , has routinely done things others thought " impossible			1
" all that changed two weeks ago in the pure @entity16 air			0
what millions of dollars of ads had not been able to do , @entity24 did for himself			2
the @entity24 who showed up in the first debate did not , as @entity20 had led voters to expect , have horns and tail			1
instead , he was the most unexpected candidate of all : a reasonable alternative to good - hearted but flailing president			0
in debate one , @entity24 even admitted he was having fun , an emotion we were not led to think he was programmed to express			1
@entity92 : share your questions for moderator @entity95 in the presence of an acceptable @entity98 replacement , the only theory of the president 's campaign , that voters had no choice but @entity20 , began to break down			1
voters began to suspect there was no alternative , not to @entity20 , but to @entity24			1
suddenly , @entity20 was the man who was n't there			2
if the 2008 election was about hope and change , the 2012 contest has always about strength and certainty			0
in these turbulent and uncertain times , the most unacceptable quality in a leader is weakness			2
in one flashing moment in a primary debate , @entity118 refused to say to @entity24 's face what he had said absent his presence , that @entity24 had created " @entity124			1
" without hesitation , voters neutered @entity118			0
general election voters may have seen similar weakness in @entity20 , as he sleepwalked with unmasked indifference through his greatest political challenge			1
if our president was n't equal to the defining moment of his own re-election , how can we trust him to rise to the test of fixing the economy ? now , with only three weeks to go , @entity20 's campaign marinades in its powerlessness			1
doubts metastasize as the administration moans that no one asked the president to protect our @entity145 ambassador , as if it had not been his responsibility			0
he 's started losing female voters , treating women as no more than a constituency of sexual organs and then hiding behind his secretary of state 's skirt			0
he pretends to protect women , hispanics , seniors , when he can not protect himself			0
@entity20 , @entity24 face big hurdle in town - hall format : unpredictability debates are the most primitive moments in our democracy			1
in these primal contests , we test those who would lead our country			0
we send our gladiators into the coliseum to see if they have the authority to command an unexpected moment , satisfying our blood thirst for strong leadership			0
there is no bigger test			0
tonight we should expect a solid performance from both men			0
@entity24 has been doing " ask @entity175 for five years			2
on the stump these days , he connects with ease , telling stories of the people he 's met , moved by their hopes and suffering			0
his growth is evidence that our campaign process is not only built to pick presidents but to shape them			0
@entity20 is gifted in the town - hall debate format , too			1
his performance against @entity187 was stately ; but one debate alone is probably not enough to rebuild what he has destroyed , the image of constancy and strength			0
five things to watch for in tuesday 's debate it takes only a moment to reveal feebleness			0
it requires many to reestablish certainty			0
one good debate tonight will help re-energize @entity20 's base but not our country 's confidence in him			1
whether victory belongs to @entity24 or @entity20 , we do not know but this cake may be baked : the @entity16 debate may have eradicated the opportunity for both candidates to change the outcome of this election			1
@entity24 may have already won this election : even if the president has a strong performance tonight , he failed us on the economy , failed us in @entity145 , failed us in @entity16			2
how can we trust that @entity20 wo n't fail us again ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			1

@entity217 : what if there are no more surprises in the presidential campaign ?
he says the momentum since the first debate has been all in favor of @entity24
it may be too late for @entity20 to make up for his debate weakness , @entity217 says
@entity217 : both candidates have shown they can handle town hall format
