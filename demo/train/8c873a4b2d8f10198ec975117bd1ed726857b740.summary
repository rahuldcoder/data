-- the re-emergence of some vaccine - preventable diseases has prompted the @entity4 legislature to consider a bill that would make it more difficult for parents to opt out of vaccinating their kids			1
the legislation would require that parents get counseling from a doctor before opting out of immunizations for their children			1
last year , the @entity14 saw its highest number of reported measles cases in 15 years , even though the disease was eliminated from the country in 2000 , according to the @entity19			1
one theory behind this rise , according to dr. @entity22 , the state assemblyman who introduced the bill , is that the recent trend away from immunizing children			2
that 's why he wants to make it more difficult to bypass vaccine requirements in his state			2
@entity31 , a 27 - year - old mother of two , is one of a number of parents who are not at all , or only partially , immunizing their kids			1
" in the first year of their life , the kids get like 15 shots , which is so much for such a tiny body , " @entity31 said			1
" i think it was more the likelihood of them catching the disease versus the likelihood of them having a bad reaction			2
" dr. @entity44 says that 's a common sentiment among many parents when it comes time to immunize their kids -- even though it 's not backed by science			1
" most of the fears about immunizations are not well founded , " he said			1
@entity44 has been a pediatrician for 32 years			2
he said one of the most damaging works ever published about vaccines was a 1998 article in the medical journal @entity58			2
it was written by the now - infamous dr. @entity60 , who argued that there was a link between the measles , mumps and rubella vaccines , and autism			2
@entity44 said , however , that no one knows what causes autism			0
even with people refusing vaccines , or delaying them , or spacing them out , autism rates continue to rise , he said			0
some scientists say that this is simply a function of more awareness , better diagnosis and a broadening of the definition of what constitutes the disorder			0
the @entity58 retracted the @entity60 article in 2004 and @entity60 lost his medical license ( @entity60 is now suing the @entity83 and one of its authors for defamation )			0
but the damage had already been done			0
many doctors believe parents ' fears about vaccines -- brought on by the @entity60 article and other non-scientific information -- has lead to a resurgence of diseases like measles and @entity97 or @entity97			1
in 2010 , 10 children died in from @entity97 in @entity4			0
the outbreak lead to a requirement that at age 10 , before entering the seventh grade , kids must have a @entity97 booster shot			1
@entity44 said the result was that the following year there were no deaths from @entity97			0
the @entity108 is hopeful that legislation like the bill in @entity4 will turn the tide of parents opting out of vaccinations			1
the anti-vaccine movement is not helping the fight against measles in @entity117			0
there were 37,000 cases of measles reported last year in all of @entity117 , compared to 222 cases in the @entity14			1
" i would say that you have a very active , if not the most active , anti-vaccination lobby globally in the @entity14 , " said @entity122 with the @entity108			1
" that certainly does n't help , if i can be completely honest and open about this			0
" @entity44 said there is plenty of good and accurate science that shows there is no definitive link between vaccines and other problems like autism			0
the problem , said @entity44 , is that because vaccines are generally administered around the time that autism is first diagnosed in children -- the first two years of life -- there is no way to prove to an absolute statistical certainty that the two are n't related			0
" that 's where all this sort of quackery comes about , " said @entity44			0
the bill in the @entity4 legislature requiring medical counseling has passed the assembly and is headed for the @entity153			2
@entity22 , author of the bill , says it looks like it will come up for a full @entity153 vote , and may pass before school resumes in the fall .			0

@entity161 would require counseling before parents can opt out of vaccinations for kids
many fears about immunizations are *unfounded* , doctor says
@entity108 expert says @entity14 has one of the *largest* anti-vaccination voices
