@entity1 , @entity0 -- is there a filmmaker in the world with worse luck than @entity7 ? he was directing @entity8 in " @entity9 , " when the actor died -- and it 's not the first time he has lost a leading man			1
is there a filmmaker in the world with worse luck than @entity7 ? @entity16 did n't die eight years ago , but @entity7 had to abandon " @entity17 " after a few days when 70 - year - old star @entity16 became seriously ill and a flash flood washed away the entire set			1
the whole fiasco is captured in the documentary " lost in @entity22			2
" but the animator - turned - director who made his name with the surreal opening sequences of " @entity27 " is also known for never giving up			1
he saved " @entity9 " by enlisting the help of @entity8 's friends , among them @entity30			1
he has even resurrected " @entity17 , " which will start shooting next year			1
the @entity31 talks to " the @entity32 " and " @entity33 " director about @entity8 , the @entity35 and why he 'll never shake off the @entity27 label			1
the screening room : @entity8 's death during " @entity9 " was tragic , but how did you deal with losing your star in the middle of production ? @entity7 : i was just , it 's like , now you 've got to use your imagination because reality has bitten very hard			1
and , so , you call your friend @entity30 [ @entity30 ] and say , " @entity8 just died			1
can you help me ? " and he says , " @entity48 , whatever			2
" that 's how it started			1
then i got @entity54 [ law ] and @entity56 [ @entity57 ] , they came ... the point is that they were all friends of @entity8 , too			1
it had to be people that were close to him in order to do what we did			2
@entity67 : how do you feel about it now you 've had some time to reflect ? @entity70 : the experience was awful			2
that 's why we can laugh now			1
making films is really hard , and this one was particularly hard			2
@entity67 : what is the most rewarding part of making films ? @entity70 : i do n't know , i mean , you know , writing and coming up with the ideas -- that 's the exciting bit			1
then it 's the slog of just getting through the shoot because there is never enough time @entity67 : you are a patron of the @entity35 , which is only three years old			1
how did that come about ? @entity70 : the festival of @entity90 approached me a couple of years ago			2
@entity93 was already a patron , and i know @entity93 and i thought that it would be nice			0
i like being a patron of things , i like patronizing things			0
and if it 's not going to be people , i 'll patronize a festival			1
@entity67 : why do you think film festivals are important ? @entity70 : the most important thing about them is you get to see films you would never get to see because the distribution system is so dominated by @entity107			0
in every country , you get @entity107 movies plus local movies			0
beyond that it 's very hard			1
@entity67 : tell us about how directing " @entity27 and the @entity115 , " your big feature directing break , came about ? @entity70 : with the success of " @entity27 , " we decided to make " @entity27 and the @entity115 " and @entity117 [ fellow @entity27 member ] and i said , " anybody named @entity7 gets to direct the film , " and the others foolishly agreed			1
we directed the film and our names went up as " directed by , " and we were film directors			0
bingo ! just like that			0
@entity67 : " @entity27 " was hugely successful , but is the downside that you 'll never shake off the label of being an @entity131 ? @entity70 : @entity27 is going to be stuck with me ' til i 'm dead and probably afterwards			1
that 's what 's gon na be on the grave , as well			2
i know exactly what i 'd like put on my gravestone : " @entity7			1
" @entity67 : what is your film philosophy ? @entity70 : all films are learning processes			0
i am still trying to work out how you make a movie			0
i did n't study at film school or any of those things			0
i did n't bother with film theory			0
mine is the @entity154 theory of film -- a bit of sugar helps the medicine go down			0
and i have always got medicine i want to give to people			0
@entity67 : which film are you most proud of ? @entity70 : " @entity33 " is the one that will probably be stamped on my grave because that one seemed to have made a big effect on a lot of people			0
and that 's all i 'm trying to do is affect people			2
@entity67 : what have you learned over the 30 - plus years you have been making films ? @entity70 : there is no one thing -- it 's just going through life			1
i do n't think you ever learn just one thing			0
at some point you start unlearning things			0
i have been working hard to unlearn everything i know			0
@entity67 : where are you with " @entity17 ? " @entity70 : " @entity17 ... " it 's been almost eight years since it fell on its little face			2
we had been trying to get the script back from the legal entanglement it was in ... and finally pulled that off			0
i had in those intervening years never read the script because i knew it was the best thing i had ever written			0
it was perfect -- i finally did it			0
i got it back and re-read it and have now been busy rewriting it			0
@entity67 : what advice would you offer to aspiring filmmakers ? @entity70 : talent is less important in filmmaking than patience			2
if you really want your films to say something that you hope is unique , then patience and stamina , thick skin and a kind of stupidity , a mule - like stupidity , is what you really need .			1

@entity8 died while shooting @entity7 's " @entity9 "
@entity7 enlisted the help of @entity8 's friends , *including* @entity30
