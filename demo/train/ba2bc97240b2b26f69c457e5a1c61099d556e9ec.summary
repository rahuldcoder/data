-- a few hundred yards from the @entity3 , the epicenter of @entity6 's protest movement , you can be blissfully unaware of the turmoil that has suddenly engulfed this island kingdom			1
caressed by the muzak of @entity10 , you can wander the polished floors of a mall that would dwarf many in suburban @entity13			2
there 's a @entity15 , a @entity17 doughnut shop and , it seems , every apparel store known to the @entity13			2
you can escape the political drama playing out here by taking in a movie at the 16 - screen megaplex cinema			2
@entity6 's malls -- and there are dozens of them -- are emblematic of an aggressive drive to make this kingdom a @entity28 powerhouse			1
the slogan is " @entity31			2
" big international banks are coaxed into setting up here ; @entity6 is the banking center of the @entity28			1
there is a surfeit of luxury property for rent			2
high - profile international events are staged here -- including round one of the 2011 @entity42 , but that was canceled last week due to the unrest			2
a large pool of migrant workers provides cheap labor -- sometimes it seems there are almost as many @entity49 and @entity50 here as @entity6			1
through the hazy glare , the @entity53 skyline boasts shining high - rise complexes , with more to come , despite a sharp decline in rental values over the past two years , according to international real estate agency @entity58			2
but just a few miles from the malls , there are non-descript villages of narrow alleys and general stores , where the jumble of cheap goods spills onto the curbside			2
in the past week , the streets of several have been festooned with black flags of mourning			2
on tuesday , 32 - year - old @entity71 was laid to rest in the seaside village of @entity73			0
he was shot in the head by security forces last friday near the @entity3 and succumbed to his injuries three days later			0
at his funeral , the @entity77 delivered a harsh judgment against @entity6 's rulers , reminding mourners of the slaying and beheading of @entity84 in the year 680 , an event widely regarded as marking the definitive break of the @entity87 and @entity89 branches of @entity90			1
@entity71 's eight - year - old son stood near his father 's grave with a photograph around his neck			0
it showed him sitting on his father 's shoulders , a broad smile on his face			0
this day , his face was a study in confusion and sadness			0
within sight of @entity106 's grave is the sea he loved as a fisherman			0
the gentle @entity28 waters are the color of lapis lazuli ; the well - worn boats of the fishermen nudge against grander leisure craft			0
after the funeral , his brother @entity115 said @entity71 would sit in his boat and talk for hours about @entity6 and " what was wrong			1
" the village saw a bitter and sometimes violent dispute about the fishermen 's access to the seafront , an incendiary issue here			0
much of @entity6 's coastline has become private property as the kingdom has become richer			1
it is just one of many grievances felt by the majority @entity132 community in @entity6 , which has been ruled by the @entity134 dynasty for 200 years			1
at the @entity3 , re-occupied by protesters since saturday , one display shows satellite photographs of all the property purportedly owned by @entity139 and the royal family on the island			0
the @entity87 complain of discrimination in housing , incentives offered by the government to @entity146 to move here , and a lack of job prospects			1
but the @entity87 also have political demands , demands that have suddenly taken on a sharper edge with the events of the past week			1
the chants of tens of thousands of marchers in @entity6 tuesday included " @entity87 , no @entity89 , only @entity6 , " but also " the regime must go			1
" the call that most echoes around the @entity3 is " down , @entity158			0
" late wednesday , some of the 23 political detainees released on tuesday were due to appear at the roundabout to address a growing crowd			0
a campaign that began barely two weeks ago to demand constitutional reform is , at least in some quarters , morphing into one for regime change , according to both opposition sources and human rights activists			1
not that the king or crown prince salman bin @entity170 will entertain such a prospect			0
the crown prince is leading an initiative to start a dialogue with opposition groups , and the government is offering various olive branches			1
besides the release of the detainees , it has promised an investigation into the killings of protesters -- the opposition says 10 died last week -- and it has cancelled the arrest warrant for @entity186 , leader of the more hardline @entity187			1
@entity186 was due back from self - imposed exile in @entity190 late wednesday			0
the crown prince has also set no deadline for protesters to leave the @entity3			0
for his part , @entity139 said tuesday that " the best alternative is to sit at the national dialogue table			0
" but this is not a state accustomed to fast - paced political change , and diplomats say there is still disagreement within the ruling elite about what concessions to offer			1
and then there is the regional dynamic			0
no sooner was @entity208 home after medical treatment in the @entity13 than @entity139 flew to meet him			0
the two royal houses are close allies -- @entity89 , hostile to @entity213 and pro-western			0
the @entity215 is based in @entity6			1
regional commentators say the @entity218 nightmare is to see the @entity219 toppled , with the @entity87 gaining ascendancy on an island so close to @entity218 that it is linked by a causeway			1
adjacent to that causeway are @entity218 's own @entity87 communities , in its oil - rich eastern provinces			1
in another world away from those sparkling malls , a gritty and unpredictable power struggle is underway in the @entity28 's smallest country .			0

*modern* @entity6 is *courting* big businesses
the @entity87 majority complains of discrimination
the opposition is beginning to *suggest* regime change
