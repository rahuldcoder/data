-- an abandoned car sits in the @entity3 desert outside @entity4 , @entity3 , the doors and trunk wide open			1
under a blanket in the trunk is a body			2
a bullet in the head			2
this was freelance journalist @entity15 's introduction to the war between rival drug cartels in @entity4			1
the 40 - year - old photographer , also known as the founder of the music company @entity20 , traveled there to observe and document the violence that has gripped what many call the most deadly city in the @entity25			2
" when i arrived in @entity4 , " says @entity15 , " within an hour , over the police scanners , a body has been found			1
and maybe 30 minutes later , another body			2
" and then another body			0
and by the end of the day , it was 10			0
the next day , 10			0
the next day , 10			0
" more than 2,000 people have been murdered in @entity4 so far this year , according to police			1
just this week , two students from the @entity35 at @entity36 were shot and killed there			2
the @entity3 government estimates that as many as 28,000 people have been killed by the cartels since 2007 , when @entity3 president @entity41 declared war on the cartels			1
@entity45 troops entered the fight , and the level of violence from the cartels escalated dramatically in response			2
" the cartels kill indiscriminately , " says @entity15			1
he arrived on the scene last december , just in time for the @entity54 season			0
in the past , he had photographed many places where people live in poverty and despair , from the @entity60 camps of @entity61 to the slums of @entity63 and @entity64			2
but in @entity4 , he says , there is a unique sense of dread			1
" the average ordinary resident of @entity4 , their life is in danger every day			1
" " you just never know if some distant cousin , perhaps , has done something , and someone is exercising revenge on them by killing you , " he says			0
as a precaution , @entity15 traveled with a local reporter familiar with the lay of the land			1
and he avoided being out on the streets at night			0
" the cartels , " he says , " own the night			2
" while visiting crime scenes throughout the city , @entity15 discovered a chilling fact about police			1
" only in @entity4 do the good guys wear masks			1
" police officers routinely wear ski masks when out in public , or investigating crime scenes , to conceal their identities and protect the safety of their families			0
for that reason , @entity15 says , he was careful to not photograph unmasked police officers			1
" those photos might be used to target law enforcement personnel when they are off duty			0
" there was another reason to be careful when photographing officers			0
" you might be taking a photo of a policeman who is secretly working for a cartel , " @entity15 says			1
" that 's something that makes murder scenes so ominous			0
" politicians are also at risk of becoming targets			0
this summer , @entity15 returned to @entity4 to photograph the national elections			1
elections held amid conflict are of particular interest to @entity118			0
he has photographed elections in @entity119 and @entity120 , among others			0
but @entity15 says the violence of the @entity3 election season was eye - opening			1
" two weeks before the elections , several candidates in the state of @entity127 were assassinated			0
" and other politicians , says @entity15 , received gruesome threats			1
" the prime candidate for mayor of @entity4 , " he says , " had a severed head left on the front door of his house			1
" the result , according to @entity15 , is that few politicians dare to openly challenge the cartels			1
journalists are in danger as well			0
@entity3 's @entity141 says 65 journalists have been murdered since 2000			1
a recent front - page editorial in @entity144 , the biggest daily paper in @entity4 , has sparked national controversy			2
" what do you want from us , " the editorial asks the cartels			2
" you are currently the @entity152 authorities in this city			0
... tell us what you expect from us as a newspaper			0
" the editorial was published after the assassination of one of the newspaper 's photographers			0
@entity15 says the government is trying to crack down on the cartels , and has arrested many key figures over the last two years			1
but he believes those efforts have only provoked even greater violence			0
" it 's a very sad city to be in , " he says .			0
