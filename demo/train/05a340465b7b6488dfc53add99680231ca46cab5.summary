-- @entity2 's car reeked of what they deemed the unmistakable odor of a decomposing body , her father and a tow company manager testified friday in the @entity12 woman 's capital murder trial			1
the odor was so powerful , @entity15 said he could not drive it home from the impound lot where it had been towed two weeks before without rolling down the windows , he said			1
" i did worry for my daughter and granddaughter , " @entity15 testified , noting that he had not seen @entity20 or her 2 - year - old daughter @entity2 since june 24			1
" i did n't want to believe what i was smelling			0
" the defense pointed out -- and @entity15 admitted -- that he did not call police after noticing the smell , nor did he tell authorities about his concerns			2
later that day , his wife @entity29 did call 911 , sparking the investigation that led to the discovery months later of @entity2 's remains and the arrest of her mother for the toddler 's murder			1
" looking back , sir , there 's a lot of things i wish i would have done , " @entity15 said , after being pressed by defense attorney @entity37 as to why he did n't contact police immediately			1
@entity15 's white @entity42 took center stage in the fourth day of @entity15 's capital murder trial			1
@entity15 , 25 , is charged with seven counts , including first degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading police in the death of her daughter , whose remains were discovered in december 2008			1
prosecutors say @entity15 used chloroform on her daughter and then put duct tape over her nose and mouth , suffocating the girl			1
@entity15 's attorneys argue that she did not kill @entity2 , but rather that the girl accidentally drowned in the @entity64 ' pool on june 16			1
they say she and her father , @entity15 , panicked and kept the death a secret			2
@entity15 denied that claim in testimony thursday			0
@entity15 's car was found , apparently abandoned , in a financial - services company parking lot on june 24			1
it was towed by a wrecker service to an impound lot on june 30 and remained there for about two weeks , the wrecker service 's operations manager , @entity72 , told jurors			2
closed up , the car gave off the faint smell of human decomposition , @entity72 testified			2
" it 's a very , very unique and distinctive smell , " @entity72 said , noting that he has had the misfortune of coming into contact with decomposition in cars numerous times			0
@entity72 said the smell became more noticeable after @entity15 and his wife arrived to pick up the car and they opened first the door and then the trunk			2
@entity15 recalled his mind racing with concern for his daughter , whom he had believed was in @entity96 , @entity97 , with the car , and his granddaughter , whom he had not seen in nearly a month			1
" please @entity101 , " he recalled thinking as he prepared to open the trunk , " do n't let this be @entity20 or @entity2			2
" the smell did not seem to dissipate after they removed a lightly - filed garbage bag from the trunk , @entity72 said			0
but after being called back to the stand later friday , @entity15 said he did not notice the stench was stronger after he opened the trunk and removed garbage from the trunk			0
in response to a question from @entity37 implying he was somehow trying to distance himself from evidence in a potential crime , @entity15 said , " i would not have walked away ... from something			2
that 's not in my make - up			0
... i believe i 'm a pretty good guy			0
" before challenging @entity15 , @entity37 questioned why @entity72 never called police , even after learning the car had been towed by authorities for forensic analysis			2
" i had no idea why it was towed to forensics , " @entity72 said			0
@entity125 , a friend of @entity15 's who testified that he went shopping with her on july 5 , testified that she had a friend 's car at the time			1
he said she explained that she did not have her own because it needed an alignment or a tune - up			0
the car also figured in testimony thursday , when @entity15 testified about an argument he had with his daughter over two missing gas cans from the storage shed at his house			1
on june 24 , @entity15 called police to report the break - in and report the gas cans missing			2
he testified that he saw his daughter later in the day and argued with her about the missing cans			0
he had a hunch she had them , he testified , as she had taken them before			0
@entity15 said that when he went to get them out of his daughter 's car , she bristled , brushed past him , quickly opened the trunk and retrieved the gas cans			1
then she threw them down and told him , " here 's your f --- ing gas cans			0
" the cans are significant because duct tape on them appears to be the same as that found on the mouth of @entity2 's skeletal remains , which were found six months after the child went missing			1
the type of tape , prosecutor @entity168 told jurors in her opening statement this week , is relatively rare			0
@entity15 said that when his daughter returned the gas cans to him , there was no tape on them			2
he said he had put the tape on to replace a missing vent cap			0
in earlier testimony , prosecutors displayed evidence and questioned witnesses suggesting that @entity2 seemed unburdened in the days after her daughter disappeared -- attending a party and going shopping for furniture , clothes and beer			1
jurors saw silent surveillance videos of @entity15 shopping at @entity192 , @entity193 and other stores in the days following her daughter 's disappearance			1
the videos were shown over the objection of defense attorneys , who said they were irrelevant to the charges against @entity15 and could improperly impeach her character and state of mind in the eyes of the jury			0
they also heard @entity208 testify that @entity15 attended an @entity210 party at his house on july 4 , 2008 -- about two weeks after @entity2 was last seen -- and that the two also went shopping the next day			1
she gave no indication that anything was wrong either time and only briefly mentioned her daughter , @entity125 testified			0
@entity208 ' testimony was similar to statements thursday from numerous witnesses who said @entity15 did not mention her daughter 's disappearance until her mother , @entity2 , reported the girl 's absence to police on july 15			1
among the witnesses was a former boyfriend , @entity224 , who said @entity15 was " happy , smiling " during his encounters with her in july			0
another friend , @entity227 , testified that he met @entity228 for lunch on july 7 and asked about @entity2			2
@entity15 told him the girl was " on a play date with one of her girlfriends who also had a child			0
" another former boyfriend , @entity237 , and his roommates said that when they asked where @entity2 was , @entity15 told them she was with her nanny , mentioning that the nanny was taking her to @entity242 and to the beach			1
in the early days of the investigation , @entity15 said the nanny , who she said was named @entity245 and nicknamed " @entity246 , " had kidnapped @entity2			1
authorities were never able to find the nanny but did track down a woman with that name who denied knowing @entity15 and sued her for defamation			0
@entity15 also repeatedly visited at least two nightclubs during the month @entity2 was missing , once participating in a " hot body " contest			1
defense attorneys explain @entity15 's behavior as a result of what they allege was sexual abuse by her father beginning as a child			1
@entity15 was schooled from a young age to " hide her pain , " her attorneys argue			2
in testimony , @entity15 has denied sexually abusing his daughter			2
in cross-examination by lead defense attorney @entity37 , those who saw @entity15 and her daughter together testified that @entity2 was well taken care of and that @entity15 , at least to their knowledge , appeared to be a good mother			1
in a dramatic moment friday morning , the fiancee of @entity2 's brother broke down when asked to describe @entity15 's relationship with her daughter			1
the fiance , @entity283 , described the relationship as " amazing			0
" " @entity20 and @entity2 had a very special bond , " @entity285 , a witness for the prosecution , said with a quivering voice while under cross-examination by @entity15 's lead attorney , @entity37			1
@entity15 appeared to cry as @entity285 spoke			0
in all , @entity15 is charged with first degree murder , aggravated child abuse , aggravated manslaughter of a child and four counts of misleading police			0
if she is convicted of capital murder , she could be sentenced to death by the seven - woman , five - man jury			0
the trial , now in its fourth day , is expected to last six to eight weeks			0
