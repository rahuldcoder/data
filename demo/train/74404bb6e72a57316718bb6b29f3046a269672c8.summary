" strategically and politically for the region , this is a big deal , and it 's absolutely the right first step , " the retired @entity28 officer said			1
@entity11 's statement came after @entity34 president @entity33 called for other countries last week to step up their efforts in the fight against @entity3			1
the @entity34 is leading a coalition to fight @entity3 from the sky over @entity41 and @entity42			1
but according to @entity44 , 80 % of the airstrikes have been conducted by the @entity34 ; the other 20 % were launched by other coalition countries			1
and there 's serious doubt about whether airstrikes alone will eliminate @entity3			2
" the airstrikes are n't going to get the job done , " @entity2 law enforcement analyst @entity49 told @entity2 's " @entity52			2
" " we need the @entity8 states to be the ones to eventually put the boots on the ground			2
whether they actually end up doing it and being dedicated to this , we 'll have to see			0
" @entity11 did n't specify exactly what he meant by a " united @entity8 force " and whether that means troops on the ground			1
the idea of a @entity68 force has been talked about for generations			0
but past efforts have been marred by distrust among @entity8 nations			0

@entity3 was initially known for trying to establish an @entity76 across parts of @entity41 and @entity42 , and it has captured swaths of land in both countries			0
but the group is expanding its reach			0
last week , @entity3 released a gruesome video that appeared to show militants beheading 21 @entity1 christians on a @entity19 beach			1
in response , @entity1 launched a series of airstrikes against @entity3 in @entity19			1
but in his speech sunday , @entity11 said the @entity1 army is n't trying to invade foreign territory			1
" your armed forces only protect the people of @entity1 , and we coordinate with our @entity8 brothers , " he said			2
who 's doing what in the coalition battle against @entity3 ? as world leaders talk about what to do about @entity3 , the militants ' atrocities and threats carry on			2
on saturday , @entity3 released a new propaganda video showing what appears to be @entity110 @entity109 fighters paraded down @entity41 streets in cages atop pickup trucks			0
the video features a man saying the @entity109 soldiers were captured by @entity3			0
@entity2 can not independently verify the authenticity of the video			0

watch : who are the @entity109 ? the heavily edited footage also includes flashback images of the beheadings of the @entity130			0
the man in the video gives an ominous warning : " we say to the @entity109 : leave your jobs , or your fate will be like these , either the cage , or under the ground			0
" @entity2 's @entity141 and @entity142 contributed to this report .			2
