@entity0 -- a showdown meeting tuesday between @entity4 attorney general @entity3 and the @entity6 chairman failed to resolve their dispute , which could result in a contempt vote against the nation 's top prosecutor			1
@entity3 and rep. @entity12 , @entity13 , met for about 40 minutes to discuss @entity12 's demand for more documents relating to @entity16 , a botched federal firearms sting operation that allowed weapons to reach @entity21 drug gangs			1
after the meeting , @entity12 told reporters that @entity3 has yet to provide the documents sought by the panel			1
unless at least some of the documents are handed over before the committee meets wednesday morning , it will proceed in considering a contempt measure , @entity12 said			1
" we are disappointed , " @entity12 said			2
" we never expected to get all the documents			0
our hope was and still is that later this evening we 'll get the documents			0
" @entity3 said he offered to provide the documents to @entity12 on the condition that @entity12 provided his assurance that doing so would satisfy two committee subpoenas and resolve the dispute			1
" i think the ball 's in their court , " @entity3 told reporters			2
" they rejected what i thought was an extraordinary offer on our part			0
" asked about whether @entity12 was open to resolving the issue before the committee meets wednesday , @entity3 said : " i think we actually are involved more in political gamesmanship " instead of a sincere effort to get the requested documents			1
a @entity54 spokesman reiterated @entity3 's position that the documents would show @entity3 had nothing to hide about his role in @entity16			2
after the meeting , deputy attorney general @entity59 sent a letter to @entity12 , expressing disappointment			1
" our offer would have provided the committee with unprecedented access to these documents , many of which are not covered by the committee 's subpoenas in this matter , " he wrote			0
" we had hoped that you shared our interest in bringing this matter to an amicable resolution and we regret that you rejected our extraordinary proposal to do so			0
" the meeting in the @entity80 building amounted to both sides reiterating positions already staked out through an exchange of letters over the past week			0
a committee statement issued before tuesday 's meeting said it was a chance for @entity3 to meet the panel 's demands for additional documents , which would allow for a postponement			2
" currently , ( the @entity54 ) has not delivered or shown the committee any of the documents it has said it is prepared to produce , " the statement continued			0
" it is not clear if they will actually produce these documents to the committee before the wednesday vote to facilitate a postponement			2
" @entity3 , however , said he made an unprecedented offer of documents and a briefing to the committee , which so far has turned him down			2
rep. @entity104 of @entity105 , the ranking @entity106 on the committee who also attended the meeting , said @entity3 was trying to end a protracted standoff with the @entity110 - led panel			1
" he sees this as a never - ending process , " @entity104 said in describing @entity3 's concerns about the continuing requests for more documentation			1
another person in the room , @entity118 chairman @entity117 , @entity119 , said afterward that he supported @entity3 and appreciated " that he is going the extra mile to resolve this			0
" sen. @entity125 of @entity126 , ranking @entity110 member of the @entity118 , also participated in the meeting with @entity3 and @entity12			1
" the attorney general wants to trade a briefing and the promise of delivering some small , unspecified set of documents tomorrow for a free pass today , " @entity125 said after the meeting			1
" he wants to turn over only what he wants to turn over and not give us any information about what he 's not turning over			0
i 'm not going to buy a pig in a poke			1
" @entity12 has accused the attorney general of stonewalling an investigation into @entity16 and how the @entity54 provided @entity146 with erroneous information about it			2
the department says it already has handed over more than 7,000 pages of records to @entity6 investigators , and that the remaining material @entity12 wants could jeopardize criminal prosecutions			1
the @entity155 launched @entity16 out of @entity156 to track weapon purchases by @entity21 drug cartels			0
however , it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border , and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the killing of @entity169 agent @entity16			0
asked by a reporter about why he was pushing so hard , @entity12 said it was because the nation and @entity16 's family deserved to know as much information as possible about the program linked to @entity16 's death			0
in particular , @entity12 's committee wants documents that show why the @entity54 decided to withdraw as inaccurate a february 2011 letter sent to @entity146 that said top officials had only recently learned about @entity16			0
the back - and - forth letters exchanged between @entity3 and @entity12 before tuesday 's meeting revealed an incremental negotiation over what the committee wanted and what the @entity54 was offering to provide			1
in a late monday letter , @entity12 made clear he wanted the documents ahead of time and also wanted @entity125 , a leading @entity3 critic , to take part			1
@entity3 agreed to a meeting but told @entity12 he wanted to include @entity104 and @entity117			1
his letter monday said the purpose of the meeting would be to reach an agreement that would avoid a " constitutional confrontation , " a reference to the committee 's planned vote on the contempt measure			0
last week , @entity3 fended off a call for his resignation at a @entity118 hearing , where sen. @entity204 , @entity205 , accused him of misleading @entity146 over the @entity16 program and other misdeeds			2
@entity3 called @entity204 's complaint " almost breathtaking in its inaccuracy , " adding , " i do n't have any intention of resigning			0
" @entity1 's @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report .			0

" i 'm not going to buy a pig in a poke , " sen. @entity125 of @entity126 says
