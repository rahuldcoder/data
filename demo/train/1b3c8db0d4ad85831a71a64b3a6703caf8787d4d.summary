-- pretty much any smartphone you buy in 2013 will have the same basic features : internet access , e-mail , downloadable apps , a camera and of course the ability to make calls and send text messages			2
but what other features should all smartphones have , regardless of what company makes it or what operating system it runs ? a few years ago , i probably would have pointed to @entity18 's @entity17 to answer that question			1
but today , as we await next month 's expected launch of the latest @entity17 , rival manufacturers are making phones with some incredibly useful features that you wo n't find on @entity18 's handsets -- at least not yet			1
for full disclosure , i 've used an iphone as my primary phone since 2008			2
but as @entity0 's mobile editor , i get to spend quality time with @entity32 , @entity33 and lots of other devices			1
so here 's my list of five @entity39 features that i 'd love to see become standard on all phones			2
consider it an open letter to the makers of all smartphones			2
maybe some of these nifty tools will inspire you to switch phones , or at least think twice the next time you 're due for an upgrade			0
an underwater phone that 's not hideous waterproof phones have existed for years , but they 've typically been bulky things that look like they belong on a construction site and lack the apps and other features of the most popular smartphones			1
you can buy waterproof cases from companies like @entity61 , but they make your phone heavier and are expensive			2
that 's why i was excited when i heard about a water - resistant version of the @entity66 , the wildly popular smartphone that was recently rated as the top smartphone by @entity68			1
it 's dubbed the @entity70 , and you would never know it 's a water - resistant phone unless someone told you			1
it 's just a little bit thicker than the standard @entity66 and has a camera with fewer megapixels , but it 's still got a stylish design and gorgeous 5 - inch screen			1
the instructions say you can take it in three feet of water for up to 30 minutes , as long as you cover up the power port and make sure the back cover is on snugly			2
i was dubious , so i made sure to back up my photos and videos in case something went wrong			2
we 've been trained our whole lives to be careful when using our phones around water , so wading into a swimming pool while holding the phone was a little nerve - wracking			1
after taking a few photos while standing in chest deep water , i switched on the underwater camera mode and took the plunge			1
i captured some great underwater shots , like the one in the photo gallery above			2
having a water - resistant phone also comes in handy if you want to walk around with your phone in your wet bathing suit			1
other adults looked at me curiously while i was using my smartphone in the water , but my 2 - year - old son , @entity108 , did n't flinch			1
hopefully , water - resistant phones will become standard before he 's old enough to own one			1
@entity112 mode let 's talk about selfies for a minute			0
love them or hate them , chances are you or someone you love has used a smartphone 's front - facing camera to snap a self - portrait			2
but it 's typically an awkward process			0
you have to extend your arm as far as you can while using one of your fingers to press the camera button			0
this often leads to blurry photos and photos where part of your face gets cut off			0
the @entity136 @entity135 phone has a dead simple way to improve your selfies			0
after you switch to the front - facing camera and press the shutter button , a countdown timer starts automatically , allowing you to get into perfect position for your self - portrait			0
i 'd guess that the vast majority of photos that are taken with a phone 's front - facing camera are selfies , so all phones should have this countdown timer built into the camera			1
( it 's worth noting that there are lots of camera apps that offer a countdown timer			0
never update an app again if you have an @entity17 , chances are you have dozens of app updates waiting for you in the @entity162			1
the pain of having to manually update @entity17 apps even prompted sen. @entity165 to ask @entity18 ceo @entity166 at a recent congressional hearing , " why the hell do i have to keep updating the apps on my @entity17 all the time , and why do n't you fix that ? " users of @entity135 phones do n't have that problem : their apps update automatically			1
that should be the case on all smartphones			0
and there 's good news for @entity165 and all of @entity180 ; @entity181 , the next version of @entity18 's mobile operating system , will include the option to have your apps update automatically			0
live tiles / widgets sometimes , when we look at our phones , we just want to quickly find a key piece of information , like the score of a football game , the temperature outside or the time a movie is playing			0
on an @entity17 , to find this information , you have to launch an app or go into your notification center			1
but both @entity135 and @entity202 phones have a feature that saves you a step			0
@entity135 's widgets let you install little bits of automatically updating information on your phone 's home screen : what 's on your calendar for the day , sports scores , extended weather forecast or news headlines			0
" live tiles " on @entity33 look like app icons , but instead of just sitting there , they display live information without you having to open the app. 5			0
a safer way to use your phone while driving as smartphones have added features like voice - guided navigation and streaming music services , they 've become incredibly useful while in a car			1
but obviously , looking down at your phone while driving is not a good idea			1
voice - assistance features like the @entity17 's @entity232 have made us a little safer by allowing us to speak commands to our phones , but they still require you to press a button to activate the microphone			1
many new cars come with features that let you wirelessly connect your phone to your car so you can use the car 's controls to make calls , listen to music or get directions			1
but setting up these features can be complex			0
the new @entity250 smartphone from @entity251 -- the first phone @entity251 designed since buying @entity253 last year -- has two new features that let you continue using your smartphone in the car without sacrificing a ton of safety			1
i have n't been able to use the @entity250 yet , but many early reviews highlight these two features as being incredibly useful			0
the first is touchless control , which lets you speak voice commands to your phone without touching it			1
after you train the phone to recognize only your voice , it is always listening for your command , whether its screen is awake or sleeping			1
without needing to touch the phone , you just say " ok @entity277 " and you can make calls , get directions or do a @entity251 search			0
as many reviews have pointed out , however , there is a catch : if you protect your phone with a password , you can use touchless controls only to make a call			2
other commands require you to unlock it with your hands			0
hopefully , this is something @entity251 will fix with a software update			0
the other breakout feature is called " assist , " which automatically detects when you 're in motion and switches to a " driving " mode designed to make you safer in the car			0
it reads new text messages aloud , announces the name of new phone callers and asks whether you want to take the call			0
given all the patent lawsuits that are sweeping the phone industry , who knows whether all of these features will ever become standard on all phones			2
but all the competition is great for consumers			0
and a guy can certainly dream			0
what other features do you think should be standard on all phones ? let us know in the comments			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity315 .			2

@entity0 mobile editor @entity315 *suggests* 5 features that should be on all smartphones
none of these five is currently on the @entity17
a truly water - resistant phone makes underwater photos fun and easy
hands - free voice controls let you use your phone safely when driving
