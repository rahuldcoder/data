-- if you 've ever looked closely at a newly minted penny , you 've probably been struck by its sheer beauty			2
@entity6 's bearded , chiseled , copper face shines forth beneath the proclamation of " @entity8 " and beside the quintessential @entity11 motto , " @entity9			1
" @entity11 revere the penny , as it encapsulates a history lesson -- @entity6 brought freedom to so many -- and a civics lesson all in one			1
but increasingly , @entity11 have stopped using the penny , as we turn toward electronic payments and away from cash			1
sadly , inevitably , like so many other beautiful , venerated historical objects , it appears that the penny now belongs in a museum			2
earlier this week , president @entity24 asked @entity25 for permission to change the mix of metal that goes into making pennies and nickels			1
he based this recommendation because it costs taxpayers about 2.4 cents to make each penny and 11.2 cents to make each nickel			1
in fact , the costs of using such coins are even higher			2
@entity38 , aka @entity39 , recognized that " time is money			0
" how much is our time worth ? the average @entity11 earns a little more than one penny for every two seconds of work			1
unfortunately , when there 's a penny involved in the transaction , it takes a couple extra seconds to fumble around for the coin and complete the purchase			2
thus , for many people , time is more valuable than this money , and increasingly we throw away pennies , lose them , do n't bother to collect them to return to the store or let them pile up in jars			1
stores pay out more pennies than they receive , so the order goes down the line to make more pennies , which are often lost and ignored -- repeating this vicious cycle			1
unfortunately , the @entity66 wo n't find a miracle metal that will make pennies worthwhile			1
the bottom line is that even if pennies could be created out of thin air , the cost of our time would outweigh the gains from using the penny			1
for nickels , the math works out better , so i 'll second the president 's call to begin making nickels out of less costly metal , rather than consigning them to the history books			0
people from across the political spectrum should unite to retire the penny			1
conservatives care about the color red -- they hate the red ink that losses by the @entity66 impose on taxpayers			1
conservatives also loathe inflation , but unfortunately , the penny 's value has been slowly eroded by inflation over the years , so the penny is n't worth a red cent any more			1
liberals love the color green			0
a penny will turn a sour shade of green if you leave it out in the elements long enough , but it 's environmentally un-green			2
using pennies means an increase in zinc and copper mining , an increase in energy use and pollution at these mines and an increase in energy use and pollution as the government , banks and businesses put rolls of pennies into sacks and lug them from place to place			0
penny advocates worry that customers will be ripped off if @entity25 kills the penny			0
in a penny - free world , sellers would round your bill to the nearest nickel for cash purchases			0
purchases totaling $ 4.98 or $ 4.99 , for example , would be rounded up to an even $ 5 , while those equaling $ 5.01 or $ 5.02 would be rounded down to $ 5			0
since so many retail prices end in a 9 , the fear has been that this rounding will gouge consumers			0
i calculated the magnitude of this " rounding tax " after obtaining data on nearly 200,000 transactions from a multistate convenience store chain			0
the data reveal that the " rounding tax " is a myth			0
in reality , the number of times consumers ' bills would be rounded upward is almost exactly equal to the number of times that they would be rounded downward			0
it turns out rounding would have given customers in my study a tiny gain of about 1 cent per every 40 purchases			0
" @entity163 , oh why , has it taken so long to recognize reality ? ? get it done [ eliminate the penny ] , and you will deserve the @entity168 ! " that 's the encouragement i received after former @entity171 chairman @entity170 read about my findings			0
@entity168 , hmmm ... that 's worth almost 150 million pennies			0
you could start a museum with that ... follow @entity178 on @entity179 join the conversation on @entity181 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

it costs taxpayers about 2.4 cents to make each penny
