the slightest movement by this man 's hand can change the behavior of at least 100 people			2
@entity6 is the 35 - year - old @entity7 conductor of the @entity8 , known for his energetic conducting style			1
" it 's very mystical how you influence the process of music making with your gestures			1
" you as a conductor have to somehow collect all these great personalities , the energy of these great people you 're working with , and bring it together so that it all goes towards the same goal			1
" there is great power in @entity25 's gestures , and this energy acts as code for the orchestra			1
@entity30 hands will not do in this business , as the orchestra needs to know where the upbeats are and how to play them			2
celebrated @entity38 - @entity37 cellist @entity36 -- who began performing at just five years old -- understands the importance of the conductor 's energy ; " the conductor is like the lightning rod			1
he activates all the molecules in the air to get people to think and feel something that 's really special			2
" not only does the conductor need to be in sync with the orchestra , but both his or her hands need to work together			1
while the right hand typically holds the baton and keeps the beat in a metronome - like fashion , the left hand displays the emotion of the piece , and tells the orchestra whether to hold a note or get louder			0
while conductors train for years to master these fundamentals , natural talent is also important			0
" there are agreed upon things that everybody knows , " explains @entity36			0
" but beyond that , the stuff that makes something really special , that 's authenticity and people have say he 's bringing 100 % of who he is on stage			0
" every conductor has their own style and puts their own mark on the movements			0
but they all aim to move the crowd to their feet at the end of every performance			0
