-- the melting glacial ice in places like the @entity3 , @entity4 and the @entity5 is a dramatic visual document of how our planet 's climate is changing			1
for @entity12 - based environmental photographer @entity11 , it is a vision he has spent more than six years trying to record and preserve			1
after an assignment for @entity14 in @entity15 in 2005 , he was shocked by the changes taking place and wanted to find a way to capture what was going on , in the @entity20 and glaciers elsewhere around the world			2
the result has been a new documentary film , " @entity25 , " based on 36 time - lapse cameras looking at 16 different glaciers in locations in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity4 , @entity15 , @entity33 , the @entity34 and @entity35			1
each camera has been taking a photograph every half - an - hour during daylight , producing almost one million pictures in total			2
@entity11 says putting the documentary together has changed his initial skepticism about climate change			1
" what we 've seen has been a complete shock			0
i never really expected to see this magnitude of change			0
every time we open the backs of these cameras it 's like ' wow , is that what 's just happened			1
' " at one point in the film , @entity53 is shown looking at the memory card he has just removed from a camera and saying : " this is a memory of a landscape			1
a landscape that is now gone and will never be seen again in the history of civilization			0
" watch : @entity0 special ' secrets in the ice ' of all the places he has filmed , it is the @entity20 that has attracted most attention in recent years			2
in september this year , the ice cap fell to its lowest extent on record			2
it grows each winter but is retreating further and further every summer , according to data collected by the @entity76			2
the summer ice extent has declined by 13 % each decade since the ice was first monitored in 1979			0
climate scientists have previously predicted the @entity20 could lose almost all of its ice cover in the summer months by 2100			0
however , the recent accelerated ice losses have led some to believe that date could come much sooner			0
while accepting that glacial ice melting has happened many times before in human history , @entity11 says what he is documenting now can no longer be considered a natural process			1
" what we 're seeing is a much more accelerated rate of change , especially in the past 40 years or so and that has clearly been traced by scientists to the impact of carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide emissions into the atmosphere			0
" " in the past 100 years , the atmosphere has accumulated 40 % more carbon dioxide in it than had been seen in the peak over the past one million years			0
" so , in the past one million years the peak of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere has been 280 - 290 parts per million ( ppm )			0
we 're now at 395 ppm and adding more every year			0
it 's gone beyond natural and is affecting the entire world , " he says			1
@entity11 , who lives in the @entity34 near @entity111 , @entity112 , believes the economic and technological solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change already exist			1
" what we need is a greater political and public understanding of the immediacy and reality of these changes			0
i believe that this film can help shift public perceptions by telling people a story that is real and happening now , " he says .			1

new documentary captures glacial ice retreating at sixteen different locations around the world
" @entity25 , " by @entity12 photographer @entity11 , recorded glacier melt since 2007
@entity53 's cameras have captured nearly one million images for the project
@entity53 hopes film will " shift public perceptions by telling people a story that is real and happening now "
