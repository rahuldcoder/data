-- as a @entity3 native , i packed my bags and moved to @entity5 in pursuit of a modeling career at 18 years old			1
even though i will always be a small - town girl at heart , i always dreamed of all the adventures of living in a big city			2
after signing with the @entity13 agency , it was n't long before i landed my first @entity15 cover			1
soon after that i was on a plane to @entity18 to do the couture shows			2
@entity22 's commercials , @entity24 of @entity25 ads and @entity27 campaigns were soon to follow			1
i knew i had arrived when @entity28 asked me to shoot a spread for @entity30 alongside supermodels @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			2
this was the first time that i was photographed by famous photographer @entity37			0
my career has taken me all over the world from @entity40 to @entity41 as a top model , and the education that i received is priceless			1
i live by the words " follow your dreams , " and " be fearless			0
" this attitude has landed me right where i am today			0
i am 43 , and i reside in @entity48 with my husband @entity49 and my 11 - year - old daughter @entity50			0
i am a cast member on @entity52 's hit reality tv show " @entity53 of @entity48			1
" outside of the instant celebrity that came with the show , the platform has been amazing			0
i have so many great opportunities coming my way , and i want to use my celebrity to change the world			0
i recently opened @entity62 in @entity48			0
the school offers classes on modeling , photography , makeup , hair styling , fashion styling and fashion designing			1
sharing all that i have learned from being in the fashion industry for the past 25 years is one of the ways that i want to inspire young people to follow their dreams and give back to the community			0
there is a lack of education available at affordable prices for young , aspiring , talented people who are interested in a career in fashion			1
before i set on my journey to @entity5 to become a fashion model , i was very shy and lacked self - confidence			1
then , i never would have believed that i would be the independent , successful , confident woman that i am today			0
i believe that this industry encourages high self - esteem and confidence which is invaluable in any career choice .			2
