-- in the battle against cancer , one video game is taking the deadly disease head - on			1
and some young patients are the winners			1
" @entity16 " is a collection of online minigames designed to get teen and young - adult cancer patients involved in understanding more about their conditions and how the body benefits from sometimes unpleasant treatments			1
researchers at @entity18 , a nonprofit organization searching for products that positively impact health behavior , were emboldened by the success of their original 2006 title , " @entity16 , " and were looking for a better way to help patients			1
" research on the original @entity29 ' showed that it impacted biology and behavior , primarily by energizing positive motivation circuits in the human brain and giving players a sense of power and control over cancer , " said dr. @entity25 , a vice president at @entity18 and professor of medicine at @entity28			1
" that gave us a whole new recipe for engineering the games in @entity44 ' by harnessing the power of positive motivation circuits in the human brain			0
" the @entity49 - based games in " @entity16 " mimic what the patients are going through in their therapy , but in a way that gamifies the treatment and involves the patient in " destroying " their cancer			1
weapons in the game include chemotherapy , cancer drugs and cells in the body 's own immune system			1
a 2008 study into the effectiveness of the " @entity68 " idea found that , for patients from 13 to 29 , sticking to a treatment regimen when managing chronic illness was a significant problem			2
playing the game greatly improved treatment adherence and understanding of that treatment in that age group , according to the study			2
" ( @entity79 ) can be incredibly disruptive and rips you away from your identity of being a normal kid , " said @entity18 spokesman @entity78			0
" the games give them the experience of what it means to be inside the body fighting cancer , using these prescriptions as weapons in their arsenal and the fight to regain a sense of control with your life			2
" many game developers lent their talents to the project			0
but developers also got some inside help			0
former cancer patients worked with the design teams to help create the right mood , challenges and visual design for " @entity68 's " five games			1
@entity108 , a 21 - year - old @entity110 major at @entity111 in @entity112 , and @entity113 , a 20 - year - old nursing major at @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 , are two cancer patients in remission who helped with the project			1
both worked on concept art , images and play testing			0
but both said that the most important aspect of the game , to them , was how it would make a patient undergoing cancer treatment feel			1
" other than feeling like crap all the time , you do n't see the results , " said @entity113 , who was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia at 2			0
" you do n't see the impact that 's brought to the body fighting the cancer			0
( the game ) puts it into perspective -- something they can visualize and definitely get hope from that			0
" @entity145 was diagnosed with papillary carcinoma in 2011 and said the cancer experience can make young people feel powerless -- like their recovery is based on passively allowing doctors and others to do their work			2
" you actually do n't feel like you 're doing that much because it 's all these outside forces acting upon you , " she said			0
" i think what 's really beneficial about a game like @entity44 ' is the whole concept of using games to help people get a sense of activity in a situation that can rob you of that activity			0
" i think that 's a very powerful thing even on a psychological level			0
" dr. @entity167 , a cancer and blood disorders specialist at the @entity170 , has been involved in a field of cancer care called adolescent and young adult oncology			2
he and his colleagues have been working on understanding why patients in that age group do n't show improvement in cancer - care rates on par with young kids or older adult patients			1
" across the board , no matter what the age , it is difficult to adhere to a common cancer schedule , " he said			0
" the number of medications , the tracking of medications can be difficult			0
" you can really engage young adults through a video game as long as the video game is cool			1
there is also this underlying theme of empowering patients to understand what they are going through and what their own role is in their cancer care			2
" with " @entity16 , " he said , the mobile aspect of the minigames allow patients to be involved even while they are waiting for , or receiving , treatment			1
the free minigames are available for the @entity209 or online			2
@entity78 said teams are working to expand the number of platforms to get the game into as many hands as possible .			0

" @entity16 " is a video game designed for young cancer patients
players use chemo , medicine and other " weapons ' to kill cancer cells
designers say visualizing helps patients stay engaged in treatment
@entity231 is on *web* and @entity209 , with more platforms to come
