-- the @entity1 declared a famine wednesday in parts of southern @entity4 and warned that the suffering could rapidly spread without a massive and immediate international response			1
" nearly 3.7 million people are now in crisis , " said @entity7 ban ki - moon			1
" we need donor support to address current needs and prevent a further deterioration of the crisis			2
" the crisis in @entity4 -- a failing state mired in internal conflict and suffering the worst drought in half a century -- has been escalating steadily for months as aid agencies have pleaded for the international community to intervene			1
wednesday , the humanitarian agency @entity19 blamed international donors for the potentially catastrophic situation at hand			0
" several rich governments are guilty of willful neglect as the aid effort to avert catastrophe in @entity28 limps along due to an $ 800 million shortfall , " an @entity19 statement said			1
thousands of @entity4 have fled the country in search of food and water , trekking for days under scorching sun toward refugee camps in neighboring @entity36 and @entity37			1
" if we do n't act now , famine will spread to all eight regions of southern @entity4 within two months , due to poor harvests and infectious disease outbreaks , " @entity38 , the @entity1 humanitarian coordinator for @entity4 , told reporters from @entity40 , @entity36			1
" it is likely that tens of thousands of people have already died -- the majority of these being children			2
" he said nearly half the people in @entity4 are in crisis and roughly $ 300 million in aid is needed in the next two months			1
aid workers call it the worst food crisis since a famine in @entity37 in the mid- 1980s that killed about 1 million people			1
" every day of delay in assistance is literally a matter of life or death for children and their families in the famine - affected areas , " @entity38 said			1
the @entity1 uses a five - stage scale to measure hunger			1
stage 5 , or famine , means that acute malnutrition rates are 30 % or more , people do not have adequate calorie or water intake and mortality rates are greater than two adults or four children per day per 10,000 people			2
think of it this way , said @entity82 , director of the @entity84 - based @entity83 : if famine were declared in the @entity87 , 3,000 or more children would be dying every day from lack of food and water			1
" this is big , " he said			0
" we have to act quickly , now			0
" @entity19 defines famine as a cocktail of causes : a " triple failure of food production , people 's ability to access food and , finally and most crucially , in the political response by governments and international donors			2
crop failure and poverty leave people vulnerable to starvation -- but famine only occurs with political failure			2
" famine used to be a term equated solely with a large - scale shortage of food			2
but the term slipped out of the official lexicon after it came to encompass a variety of factors that add up to a complex emergency , said @entity119 , an expert in food security at the @entity121 at @entity122			0
" actually , a lot of famine happens when there is food in the market , " he said			0
" it 's about people 's inability to acquire that food			2
famine represents a catastrophic failure of all the systems that people rely on to survive			2
" that includes the deaths of livestock , displacement of people and conflict			2
and that is what has happened in southern @entity4 , where people have had to make heart - wrenching choices simply to stay alive			1
a mother might have to decide whether to keep her baby alive or split her money to feed all her children			0
a family may take down their thatched roof , the only shelter they have , to make sure a precious cow can eat			0
grandparents might forgo their share of a meal to ensure survival for the youngest generation			0
@entity119 said many @entity87 stung by the recession have had to make difficult life choices			1
multiply that by many times to get an idea of what it means to be @entity4 right now			1
" the thing about food is that you have to have it every day , " he said			0
" it 's not like buying a car or clothes			0
it 's where the rubber meets the road			0
" after wednesday 's declaration of famine , @entity87 secretary of state @entity179 announced $ 28 million in additional funding for the crisis			1
" we have already responded with over $ 431 million in food and nonfood emergency assistance this year alone , " @entity179 said in a statement			2
" but it is not enough -- the need is only expected to increase and more must be done by the @entity87 and the international community			2
" part of the problem with donations is that it 's politically difficult to give money for an event that has not happened yet , @entity82 said			0
he understood @entity19 's position and the frustration of aid workers on the frontlines who are bearing witness to immense human suffering			0
but how do you justify millions for a catastrophe that " might " happen , he asked			0
about 10 million people are at risk of famine in the @entity208			1
@entity4 , wracked by years of internal violence and insecurity , is the worst affected			1
many @entity4 have fled to the @entity213 camp , a refugee complex in @entity36 intended to house 90,000 but now bursting with 400,000 people			1
@entity216 strife has exacerbated drought - caused food shortages and livestock deaths			0
the nation has not had an effective government for two decades and government forces have been battling @entity224 militants in the capital , @entity226			0
humanitarian agencies have not been able to reach famine - affected areas , said @entity229 , the @entity87 ambassador to the @entity1			1
" @entity224 is principally responsible for exacerbating the consequences of the drought situation by preventing its own people from being able to access critically needed assistance , " she said			0
@entity224 , a group of @entity236 insurgents with affiliations with @entity238 , controls large portions of @entity226 and parts of southern and central @entity4			2
the militants had accused @entity243 humanitarians of being anti-muslim			0
but earlier this month , the @entity238 - linked group pledged to allow aid groups access to areas under its control , reversing an earlier decision banning them			0
" president @entity255 and @entity179 have aggressively worked to and asked us to test @entity224 , " said dr. @entity251 , chief administrator of the @entity252 , in an interview from the @entity213 refugee camp			0
" if they 're going to provide humanitarian access , we 're going to stand with the @entity1 and other partners to make sure that humanitarian organizations can get in and can reach the most affected people			1
it 's no coincidence that the precise geography that have been labeled a famine and have met the technical designation of famine are precisely those areas where @entity224 has limited access , has harassed aid workers and has made it difficult for people to eke out a basic standard of living and existence			0
" humanitarian agencies have welcomed the pledge by @entity224 , but said the earlier ban intensified the crisis			0
@entity1 officials were able to airlift emergency supplies to southern @entity4 last week after the @entity236 militants promised to lift the ban			1
the south is home to about 80 % of the nation 's malnourished children , the @entity281 said			0
" more than ever , @entity4 people need and deserve our full attention , " @entity38 said			1
" at this time of crisis , we must make exceptional efforts to support @entity4 wherever they are in need and expect that all parties will do the same			1
" @entity0 's @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 contributed to this report .			0
