@entity0 -- two key executives in @entity4 's media empire resigned friday , and their former boss added public relations muscle as he began a series of apologies in the phone - hacking scandal			1
out are @entity10 , chief executive of @entity12 , and her predecessor in the job , @entity13 , who most recently served as chief executive of @entity16 , publisher of @entity18			1
@entity13 wrote @entity4 that he had seen reports of actual and alleged misconduct when he was executive chairman of @entity12 , which operated the now - defunct @entity21			1
" the pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable , " @entity13 said in a letter provided by @entity16			1
" that i was ignorant of what apparently happened is irrelevant and in the circumstances i feel it is proper for me to resign from @entity29 , and apologize to those hurt by the actions of the @entity21			2
" for his part , @entity4 began a campaign of contrition and reform friday , apologizing to the family of a murdered @entity38 teenager whose voicemail allegedly was hacked by staffers of @entity21			1
" as the founder of the company , i was appalled to find out what happened , " @entity4 said after speaking with relatives of @entity42 , 13 , who went missing and was later found dead			1
" of course i apologized			2
" @entity4 will offer a broader apology to those whose privacy may have been violated by journalists in an ad that is to appear in newspapers saturday			1
police in the @entity38 have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking			2
there were also allegations that @entity29 reporters may have bribed law enforcement officers			2
some of the claims @entity61 faces relate to the @entity21 's alleged hacking , while she was editor , into @entity65 's mobile phone account			2
staffers were accused of intercepting messages in search of news			2
they then allegedly deleted messages to keep @entity65 's mailbox from filling up , giving her family and friends false hope that the schoolgirl was still alive			2
the family 's attorney , @entity76 , said the family will seek " legal remedies " after their ordeal			2
" they were suffering private grief , " @entity76 said			2
" people were intruding into it			2
" @entity4 appeared humble and sincere during the meeting , @entity76 added			1
" he apologized many times			2
" @entity4 's @entity21 , a 168 - year - old tabloid that was @entity38 's biggest sunday newspaper , folded over the weekend in the wake of accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorism victims , politicians and celebrities			1
" we are sorry for the serious wrongdoing that occurred , " @entity4 will say in saturday 's ad			1
" we are deeply sorry for the hurt suffered by the individuals affected			1
" " the @entity21 was in the business of holding others to account			2
it failed when it came to itself , " according to text of the ad provided by @entity12 , which will also express regret for not acting more quickly " to sort things out			0
" @entity4 will say in the ad that he realizes that apologizing is not enough and he pledges concrete action			1
@entity38 prime minister @entity110 has been among those publicly decrying the hacking , blasting @entity4 's company wednesday as he launched a high - powered investigation into the nation 's press			1
yet he has his own ties to the scandal , given his relationship with @entity120			0
@entity120 quit as @entity21 editor in 2007 , after his former royal editor and a private detective were convicted of conspiracy to hack into royals ' voicemails			0
but even while offering his resignation , he claimed to be unaware of the crimes and he was not charged at the time			0
months later , @entity120 joined up with @entity110 , then the @entity129 leader			1
after last year 's election , @entity110 rose to prime minister -- and took @entity120 with him , as his communications director			1
@entity120 worked from @entity133 through january , when he resigned as @entity110 's spokesman when the scandal blew up afresh			1
@entity110 hosted @entity120 overnight in march at @entity136 , the prime minister 's country estate , a @entity133 source said friday			1
the aim of the invite , added the source , was to thank his former communications director for his work on @entity110 's behalf			1
then , earlier this month , @entity120 was himself arrested in connection with claims of phone hacking and corruption dating to his days as the @entity21 editor			0
after the arrest , the prime minister took full responsibility for hiring @entity120			0
but while not denying this personal connection , @entity110 has maintained public pressure against @entity29 this is just one of a flurry of dizzying developments related to the scandal in recent days			1
@entity29 , which has been at the center of the storm , has hired the firm @entity161 to handle its public relations and prominent @entity164 attorney @entity163 to help navigate			0
one brick to fall friday was @entity61 , who had been under pressure to step down			0
a chief executive of @entity12 , she was @entity21 editor at the time of some of the most serious allegations against the newspaper			1
" as chief executive of the company , i feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt , and i want to reiterate how sorry i am for what we now know to have taken place , " @entity61 said in a statement through @entity12			1
" i have believed that the right and responsible action has been to lead us through the heat of the crisis			0
however , my desire to remain on the bridge has made me a focal point of the debate			0
" she said that the focus on her is " detracting attention " from endeavors to fix the problems and that her resignation gives her more time to fight the allegations against her			0
@entity110 believes that @entity61 ' resignation was the right decision , a @entity133 spokesman said			1
@entity202 leader @entity201 said he was pleased she had " finally taken responsibility for the terrible events that happened on her watch , like the hacking of @entity42 's phone			0
" former deputy prime minister @entity210 , who says police now tell him his phone was hacked 44 times , also welcomed @entity61 ' resignation			0
" she seems to be the center of all of it , and yet she keeps saying ' not me ' -- that seems to be the common line at @entity12 , " he said , adding that her resignation is " a decent step towards getting better and decent reporting in this country			0
" @entity210 described @entity4 as a " spider in the middle of this web " and said it was " about time we took him on rather than running away from him			1
" campaign group @entity234 , which has been calling for a full inquiry into alleged phone hacking by @entity21 , said : " the key issue is not however whether @entity10 is in work , but whether she lied to @entity240 , told the full truth to the police or was engaged in a massive cover - up			0
that is what we want			0
the victims want to know			0
" @entity244 , @entity4 's son and chairman of @entity12 , thanked @entity61 for " her 22 years of service to the company " and said he understood her decision to resign			1
" she has been one of the outstanding editors of her generation and she can be proud of many accomplishments as an executive			2
we support her as she takes this step to clear her name , " he said in a statement			0
" we will follow this up in the future with communications about the actions we have taken to address the wrongdoing that occurred , " he said			0
a day before she resigned , @entity61 agreed to attend a hearing before @entity38 lawmakers tuesday into the phone - hacking scandal			0
however , she said her answers might be limited by ongoing police and judicial inquiries			0
@entity244 and @entity4 confirmed late thursday that they would also appear at the july 19 hearing before the @entity275 , after initially declining to attend			1
in friday 's statement , @entity244 said he and his father would speak to the committee " directly about our determination to put things right			0
the company has made mistakes			0
it is not only receiving appropriate scrutiny , but is also responding to unfair attacks by setting the record straight			0
" @entity287 will replace @entity61 , @entity29 said friday			0
@entity287 is a former newspaper journalist who has been the chief executive of @entity288 since 2003			1
@entity4 said @entity287 is an " outstanding executive with unrivalled experience across our journalism and television businesses			1
" meanwhile , the @entity293 is investigating @entity29 after a report that employees or associates may have tried to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of september 11 survivors , victims and their families			0
@entity4 's @entity29 encompasses @entity302 , @entity18 , the @entity303 and @entity305 publishers in the @entity164			2
@entity12 -- a @entity38 subsidiary of @entity29 -- owns the @entity306 , @entity307 and the @entity308 in @entity38			0
@entity1 's @entity309 and @entity310 contributed to this report .			0
