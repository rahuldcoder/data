-- the @entity1 responded friday to a chorus of voices calling for gun control in the wake of last week 's horrific mass shooting in @entity7 by doubling down on its own position : more guns , not fewer , provide true security			1
after one of the worst mass shootings in @entity16 history -- 20 children and seven adults killed , not including the gunman -- polls show that a slight majority of @entity16 favor restrictions on guns			0
conservative democrats and even some republicans who have supported gun rights have said they are open to discussing gun control			1
but the @entity1 made its position clear : the prominent gun rights organization will not budge an inch toward discussion of gun control			1
to the contrary , the group announced it will fund a team that will design a program to get armed security personnel on school grounds across the country			2
" you know , five years ago , after the @entity46 tragedy , when i said we should put armed security in every school , the media called me crazy , " @entity1 executive vice president @entity39 said			1
but what if the gunman , @entity47 , had been confronted by a trained security guard ? " will you at least admit it 's possible that 26 innocent lives might have been spared ? " @entity39 asked			2
" the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun , " he said			2
@entity39 's position sets the stage for a contentious battle between the @entity1 , one of the most powerful lobbying groups in @entity63 , and the @entity65 administration , which has promised quick action on " real reforms " to gun laws			1
this week , president @entity65 tapped vice president @entity69 to lead a task force to start formulating those reforms and , with the @entity74 's support , sen. @entity71 , @entity72 , said she will introduce legislation to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004			1
gun owners fear new legislation could tread on their rights the @entity1 had remained silent in the wake of last week 's school massacre as the debate on gun control was shaped by these moves in @entity63			1
that changed friday when it drew a line in the sand , providing its alternative vision for protecting @entity16 children through armed security personnel at all schools			1
" why is the idea of a gun good when it 's used to protect the president of our country or our police , but bad when it 's used to protect our children in our schools ? " @entity39 asked			1
" we need to have every single school in @entity16 immediately deploy a protection program proven to work -- and by that i mean armed security , " he said , reading from a prepared statement			2
the @entity1 executive appeared aware that he was staking a bold position in front of a divided public that recent polls suggest is leaning toward tightening gun laws			1
in case he was n't , protesters interrupted his address twice , shouting @entity120 slogans and bearing banners in front of his podium , including one that said " @entity1 killing our kids			2
" @entity39 spoke exactly one week after the deadly shooting at @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity7			1
across the nation , church bells rang in remembrance of the victims			0
the @entity1 was among those groups that observed a moment of silence at 9:30 a.m. , the same time as last week 's massacre			1
residents in @entity129 and across the country paused for a moment of silence in memory of the victims			0
many websites went dark momentarily to mark the moment			0
funerals for five of the victims -- school psychologist @entity148 , behavioral therapist @entity150 and students @entity152 , @entity154 and @entity155 -- also took place friday			0
a slight majority of @entity16 favor major restrictions on guns : 52 % , up 5 points from a survey taken in august after the july shooting inside a movie theater in @entity164 , @entity165 , where 12 people died , according to a @entity0 / @entity168 poll released wednesday			0
more than 195,000 people have signed an online @entity74 petition supporting new gun control legislation			1
yet the @entity1 has support among many @entity16 who believe that taking steps to limit access to guns is not the answer			2
one @entity0 reader summed up the pro-gun argument this way : " we ... put undercover , plain clothed air marshals on our planes to protect us when we fly			0
i fully support the same in our schools to protect my children			0
every school should have one , " @entity185 wrote			0
" a cop in every school is a much better solution than a holster on every teacher 's belt			0
but it does n't go far enough			0
this is an attempt to contain the problem to schools and avoid the broader discussion , " another @entity0 commenter wrote			0
parents defend right to keep guns in the home others pointed to the apparent contradiction among conservatives who want to reduce public spending but also support the @entity1 's idea to arm schools			1
who will pay for the thousands of armed guards ? several @entity0 readers asked			0
many suggested taxes on guns that could fund such a program			0
why own a military - style rifle the @entity1 envisions a " @entity215 " where qualified police , military , security personnel and others organize to protect schools			1
schools remain a target for criminal gunmen because they are not protected by armed security the way other important institutions are , @entity39 said			1
policies banning guns at schools create a place that " insane killers " consider " the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk , " he said			1
former congressman @entity233 will lead the school security project			0
armed personnel will be part of the security model but not the only component , @entity233 said			1
" @entity240 safety is a complex issue with no simple , single solution , " he said			0
" but i believe trained , qualified , armed security is one key component among many that can provide the first line of deterrence as well as the last line of defense			0
" @entity1 power and money go a long way in states the @entity1 , with its roughly 4.3 million members , is the standard bearer for protecting the @entity256			2
it is also the source of hefty campaign donations			0
during the 2012 election cycle , the @entity1 donated $ 719,596 to candidates			2
republicans received $ 634,146 of that , according to the @entity265 ' analysis of federal campaign data			0
some $ 85,450 went to @entity267 , many of them in states that are considered more conservative when it comes to gun control laws			1
the @entity1 's point man on its school security study , @entity233 , received $ 7,000 from the organization for his 2000 congressional campaign , and $ 7,450 in 1998			2
@entity0 staff contributed to this report .			0
