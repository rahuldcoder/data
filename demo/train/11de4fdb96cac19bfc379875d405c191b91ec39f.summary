-- in september 1970 , a 28 - year - old @entity1 led the @entity2 heading into the @entity4 @entity3 at @entity5			1
a crash during the final practice session ahead of the race took the life of the man in pole position for the title , whilst at the same time providing him with a unique position in sporting history			2
@entity1 's supremacy in the drivers ' championship was such that , despite his death , none of his fellow racers could overhaul his lead in the standings , making @entity1 the only posthumous world champion in @entity2			1
in a strange twist of fate , the @entity24 lost his life in almost the same place on the @entity5 track as his childhood icon , @entity31 driver @entity30 -- after a brake failure on his @entity33 saw him crash into the famous @entity35 curve at nearly 150 mph			2
author of " @entity1 : @entity42 1 , " @entity37 recalls a man who , prior to his fatal crash , boosted the profile of the entire sport			1
" motorsport , at least in @entity44 , stayed in a quiet corner , " @entity37 told @entity0			0
" it took a new type of personality to give it broader attendance			0
there were only two guys who fit that picture ; the @entity55 @entity54 and @entity1			1
" @entity37 believes @entity1 -- who was orphaned as an infant when his parents were killed in a bombing raid -- had a star quality that transcended the sport			1
" he did have a very special face that you would n't forget easily , " he said			0
" he married a beautiful girl from @entity64 and he was outspoken in a way that had nothing to do with the identical phrases of sports champions			0
" and of course he was a spectacular driver			2
he had a sense for car control that allowed him to master situations that had rarely been seen before , not to mention afterwards			0
" fittingly , @entity37 believes @entity1 's finest victory was his last , the first @entity2 grand prix to be held at @entity75 in 1970			1
the track had taken the life of the legendary @entity79 racer @entity78 two years previously , and the @entity31 @entity3 was only switched to the new venue on the insistence of the drivers , who believed it was a safer alternative to the nurburgring			2
heading into the race , @entity1 lead @entity87 @entity86 by 11 points in the drivers ' championship , but both were behind @entity93 's @entity92 on the grid , with the @entity96 driver starting in pole position			1
" [ @entity1 ] in the @entity33 , and @entity92 were close , " recalls @entity37			1
" in their top speed and everything			2
they overtook each other 30 or 40 times , and in such a fair manner that they used their fingers to show which the side the other one could overtake safely			0
" to point out which side was safer was a fine , fine way of racing			0
it was perfect for the spectators and they loved it			0
in the end @entity1 won by tenths of a second and it was just fantastic			1
" such acts of sportsmanship were typical of a golden generation of drivers such as @entity86 , @entity122 , @entity54 , @entity123 and @entity1 according to @entity124			1
and between @entity1 and @entity54 's there was friendship to accompany the rivalry : " he was a great friend and he had a great sense of humor , " @entity54 told @entity0			1
" we traveled together a lot , to and from races because we were both living in @entity134 from 1968			0
we were living 300 meters apart [ on @entity135 ] , so @entity1 was a close friend , and @entity136 ( @entity1 's wife ) still is			1
" despite the highly competitive arena in which they dueled , @entity54 believes the dangers in @entity2 during that time contributed to respect between drivers			1
" motor racing in those days was very dangerous , " he said			0
" during my period , if you raced in @entity2 for five years there was only a one in three chance you were going to live			1
" the respect you had for other drivers was absolutely paramount , and that relationship extended from our friendship to our respect of each other on the track			0
" i can not think of one occasion when @entity1 and i were racing hard together and conducted ourselves in anything other than the correct and appropriate fashion			2
" one of those occasions was the @entity163 @entity3 in 1969 , where @entity1 was on pole , with his close friend right behind him			2
" we had 30 lead changes between him and i , in one race			0
that 's not even heard of today			0
" it was slipstreaming , it was passing			0
we used it intelligently ; we were using the track correctly and behaving correctly			0
that does n't mean we were old fashioned at all , it means we were intelligent and respectful			0
" at the end of race , @entity54 beat off the challenge from @entity1 who eventually settled for fourth place			1
" one of my great memories is being able to race as close as we did that day with someone who was also my close friend			0
that 's a lasting memory for me			0
" it was @entity54 who lost his title to @entity1 in 1970 , a for the @entity190 there was no more deserving opponent			1
" the combination of @entity1 and the @entity33 in 1970 was , in my opinion unbeatable			1
in his time , @entity1 was one of the top two or three drivers in the world , " he said			1
@entity33 -- who are sponsored by @entity0 -- re-entered @entity2 at the start of the 2010 season , following a 16 - year break from the sport			2
team principal @entity204 said his team owe a debt to @entity1 's talent			2
" @entity1 holds a very special place in the hearts of all @entity2 and @entity33 fans , " said @entity204			1
" he showed his @entity212 - given skills in @entity2 , winning and doing so with style			2
" at @entity215 we know we are standing on the shoulders of giants when racing with the @entity33 name			0
we are all very proud to play our part in helping keep his memory alive			0
