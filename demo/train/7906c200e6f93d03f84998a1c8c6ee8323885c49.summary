-- did you hear that ? it 's a door busting open in @entity4 , unblocking a huge backlog of airline issues that will directly affect @entity7 's millions of air travelers			0
for the first time since 2007 , after 23 extensions , @entity9 has finally passed a long - term funding bill for the @entity13			1
it costs $ 63 billion and will last through 2015			1
president @entity15 is expected to sign it into law			2
for the millions who fly commercial airlines yearly in the @entity7 , here are five reasons why you should care : 1			0
airline tarmac delay rules to be the law of the land many of the tarmac delay rules for commercial airlines -- like reporting flight delays and cancellations and providing passengers with adequate food , water and ventilation in planes stuck on the tarmac -- will be more than just rules			1
they 'll be the law of the land , backed with the full enforcement and authority of the federal government			2
somehow , not included in the legislation is the three - hour limit on the amount of time planes can remain on the tarmac before they must return to the gate			1
it 's still a regulation			0
" there 's a concern it might lead to more flight cancellations or delays , so it may need more study before it becomes law , " said @entity51 of the nonprofit @entity52			0
consumer advocate group @entity60 blames the exclusion on politics			0
" @entity66 , in the end , sided with their friends the airlines by forcing removal of the [ three - hour tarmac delay limit ] in the newly codified law for airline passengers , with total disregard for what 's best for the flying public , " wrote executive director @entity63 in an email to @entity0			1
investigation into cell phone use on planes is there really a good reason why we ca n't use our phones on planes ? the arguments have long raged on both sides			1
the new law requires a government study within 120 days to look into the issues surrounding aircraft cell phone use			1
speaking of studies : would airlines lose or damage fewer bags if they had to pay for them ? the law orders a study , due in 180 days , to find out			1
better information about child safety seats , insecticides traveling with small children and their safety seats may be a little easier			0
the new law requires airlines to post on their websites the maximum dimensions of child safety seats that can be used aboard their aircraft			1
also , the @entity105 must post online a list of countries that force airlines to spray cabins with insecticide			0
better access to the halls of power airline travelers who feel powerless against the system may like the @entity105 advisory board created under the new law			0
the @entity117 for @entity118 will include appointed officials from airports , airlines , the government and a member specifically to represent consumers			0
also , the law creates a @entity105 phone line and website for consumers to lodge complaints			1
high tech air traffic control systems the legislation clears the way for the @entity13 's highly anticipated satellite - based air traffic control system , which promises to make air travel more efficient , less air - polluting and less time - consuming			1
that system , part of a massive air - traffic overhaul called @entity140 , is expected to be put into place about 2020			2
other stuff : -- federal subsidies for rural airports the bill trims the embattled $ 200 million @entity147 airport subsidies program , which opponents say is a waste of money			2
small rural airports that handle fewer than 10 daily passengers and are less than 175 miles from a major hub airport will no longer qualify for federal operating subsidies			0
@entity155 and @entity156 are exempt from the cuts			0
-- smoking fourteen years after smoking was banned on domestic flights for @entity7 commercial airlines , the law shuts the door on the last bastion for mile - high smokers			2
lighting up will no longer be allowed aboard any charter aircraft or other for - profit flights , foreign or domestic , says @entity51			1
-- special exemptions for military the law includes a message to the airlines called a @entity172 that nudges industry leaders to consider offering special travel exemptions for military members			0
@entity9 is hinting that airlines should cut troops a break on airline rules surrounding luggage and traveling family members			0
overall , says @entity51 , the new @entity13 law could end up saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars -- perhaps billions -- " if only for the ability to plan ahead and coordinate projects in the future			2

new @entity13 bill , expected to become law , offers consumer **protection*s* and information
@entity194 delay rules now become law , but three - hour delay regulation is not included
$ 63 billion bill creates aviation consumer *protection* *committee*
studies will look at cell phone use aboard aircraft and *compensation* for lost bags
