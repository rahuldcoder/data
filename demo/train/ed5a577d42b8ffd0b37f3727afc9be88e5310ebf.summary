-- each year , more than 3 million @entity1 commit to @entity2 , the pilgrimage to @entity4 that represents the fifth and final " pillar " of @entity6 and the largest annual human gathering on the planet			1
every muslim who is physically and financially able to do so is expected to make this pilgrimage once in their lifetime			0
as described in the @entity12 , each pillar of @entity6 acts as a guide to day - to - day conduct for @entity1 , outlining proper professions to @entity17 , prayer and spiritual mindfulness , not unlike the @entity20 for @entity21 or @entity23 's @entity22			1
for this year 's @entity2 , @entity24 from around the world documented their journeys , describing their experiences as they complete this @entity6 sacrament			1
thanks to the power of social media and platforms like @entity0 's @entity33 , they 've been able to share their faith with the world , giving @entity1 and @entity36 alike a glimpse of the significance of this powerful and transformative event			1
the 2011 @entity2 also holds special significance for @entity1 in the wake of the @entity42 this year			1
though the pilgrimage has traditionally been thought of as an undertaking for middle - aged or senior @entity1 , increasing numbers of young pilgrims have been making the trip to @entity4 in the past decade			1
while on @entity2 , @entity1 pilgrims travel great distances to @entity4 , @entity50 , during the last month of the @entity6 calendar , which is tied to the lunar calendar			1
at @entity4 , nestled among the mountains and deserts of the western part of the country , lies the @entity57			0
this is the spiritual epicenter of @entity6 and the location of the @entity60 , the first @entity6 house of worship , built by the patriarch @entity62 and his son @entity63			1
when @entity1 orient themselves to @entity4 for their five daily prayers , they are praying in the direction of the @entity60			2
during @entity2 , " one needs to spend money , exert one 's body , behave with character and in all of that turn sincerely to @entity17 , " says @entity67 , 32 , a @entity1 chaplain at @entity68			1
" if one can spend a few weeks totally devoted to one 's faith , it makes it that much easier to make one 's faith a living reality when one is at home and living one 's ordinary life			0
" @entity83 , the " city of pilgrims , " the first official stop on the @entity2 as @entity87 explains , @entity1 engage in prayer and contemplation at @entity4 for several days , undertaking rituals meant to spiritually purify themselves and bring their souls into better alignment with @entity17			1
" the major rituals include walking around the @entity60 seven times , drinking from the holy @entity95 and holding a vigil at the plains of @entity98 led by an @entity99 , a @entity1 cleric , kind of like a priest , " he said			2
these observances are then followed by a three - day festival called @entity103 , a global celebration for all @entity1 commemorating @entity62 's piousness and obedience to @entity17			1
" @entity87 , 27 , made this year 's @entity2 with his wife , whom he recently married			2
he describes his pilgrimage as " quite breathtaking , " remarking on the powerful sight of people from all walks of life gathered in the same ceremonial garb , for the same purpose			2
" i saw people from @entity116 , @entity117 , from @entity118 , from @entity119 -- @entity1 from all over the world speaking different languages , coming with their own cultures and ways of doing things , but all gathered here because of their bond with @entity6 , " he said			1
@entity87 views his @entity2 as a powerful renewal of his faith , expressing his awe at the sheer number of people gathered at @entity4 and the sense of fulfillment he feels at seeing the @entity60 with his own eyes			2
" @entity6 has n't been seen in a very positive light over the past decade , but this event really shows how everyone from all walks of life , from all over the @entity141 , is out here for the same purpose , " he said			1
there 's no type of discrimination here			0
everybody is gathered here as one body			0
there 's this powerful feeling of brotherhood and togetherness			0
" growing up in a @entity1 family and reading about it or seeing videos of it , none of that helped me grasp what was actually going on			2
when you actually do it , it 's very strenuous			0
but it 's also the most rewarding thing i 've done in my life			0
" video tour of @entity4 @entity170 , executive director of the @entity171 , credits the enthusiasm of young @entity1 to participate in @entity2 to a " revival , an @entity6 awakening around the world , part of which we have seen in the @entity42			1
" though @entity1 in particular may be reconnecting with @entity6 values , he notes that a belief in unity , peace and justice is a central principal of all @entity184 faiths			1
@entity170 also believes that in times of global turmoil and economic uncertainty , many young @entity1 are drawn to the @entity2 out of a yearning for equality and camaraderie			1
all pilgrims at @entity4 are expected to dress and behave in a manner that removes all outward signifiers of wealth or social standing and focus entirely on their spiritual development			0
" i think many young people are rediscovering the proud heritage of @entity6 and that they belong to a higher cause , " he said			1
" and i think more people are going on @entity2 now because they want to attach themselves to that higher cause and the higher values that they sometimes see challenged by worldly governments and societies			2
" it 's a rediscovery of their roots and their identity , " he continued			0
" hopefully , that strength and momentum and that spiritual charge will help them go back to their societies and play constructive and moral roles in their communities			0
" closeup video of pilgrims circumambulating the @entity60 , one of the @entity2 rituals @entity224 , 22 , shares this belief in an @entity6 awakening among @entity1 youth , observing how @entity4 during @entity2 is a sea of tranquility and unity in one of the most turbulent regions on the planet			1
" so many people have all come here for the same purpose : to seek @entity17 's mercy and forgiveness , " he said			0
" in reality , many of these people , when not in @entity4 , will fight and spill each other 's blood			0
but in this moment , in this city , i have not seen one confrontation			0
" here , @entity1 can strengthen the foundation of their faith : being one people , who worship one @entity17			2
" that 's a sentiment echoed in @entity87 's experience while on @entity2			2
" i 've never really had this feeling in my life , " he said			0
" to know the importance of this landmark , in this city , in this place			0
to know the history of the people who have been in this place and worshipped in this city -- not just in our lifetime or generation but throughout history -- that 's an out - of - this - world feeling			0
" a previous version of this story incorrectly referred to the @entity20 as a text for @entity267			0
it is a book of prayers and services for @entity21 .			0
