@entity0 -- president @entity2 defended the @entity4 's decision tuesday to release a controversial torture report , arguing that while there was never a " perfect " time to release the report , it 's important to publicly admit that the country made mistakes			1
" one of the things that sets us apart from other countries is when we make mistakes , we admit them , " @entity2 said in an interview with " @entity13 " on tuesday that aired simultaneously on @entity14			1
" we did some things that violated who we are as a people , " he added			0
the report , which details the @entity25 's extreme interrogation techniques used on terrorists after the september 11th attacks , was released by the @entity4 despite a last - minute pleas from secretary of state @entity29 and members of @entity31 not to release the information to the public at this time , fearing that its release could spark global attacks against @entity36			1
while the president acknowledged those concerns , he said his administration has taken precautionary measures around the world to prepare for any type of global reaction			0
earlier tuesday , the cia director @entity44 defended the techniques outlined in the report , saying that the interrogations " did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans , capture terrorists and save lives			0
" but @entity2 contested their reasoning to @entity14 's @entity53 arguing , " the information we get is n't necessarily better than doing things the right way			2
" under his administration , @entity2 would n't say if any types of torturous interrogation techniques have been used on detainees , but he asserted that if they were , they would not be tolerated and that perpetrators would be ' held into account ' for breaking the law			2
moving forward , @entity2 says he will effort ways to hold the @entity25 accountable for the way it treats detainees , in order to ensure that some of the techniques outlined in the report are n't used again			1
" the lines of accountability that needed to be set up were n't always in place , " the president told @entity72			0
in a hypothetical situation -- where the @entity36 was attacked in a similar way as it was on september 11th -- the president said that he still would not condone the types of torture techniques described in the report , and that he is trying to put accountability systems in place now , should that become a problem in the future .			0
