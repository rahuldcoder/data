@entity0 -- the crops for sale carry labels like " dark vader , " " uk cheese " and " white russian			0
" but the overwhelming smell of cannabis gives away the fact that there is really only one item for sale here : medical marijuana			2
there was little publicity for @entity0 's first medical marijuana farmers market held on sunday			1
no posters or signs were hung outside the market 's venue , a small club where " erotic poetry " readings are held			2
word of mouth alone though packed the hall as hundreds of people lined up to go in			0
they gained entrance with a recommendation from a health care provider stating that they need marijuana to treat a medical condition			1
" i am actually standing upright because of cannabis , there 's nothing else i found that would help me with chronic pain issues , " said @entity35 , a gaunt figure with long dangling dreadlocks			0
" i could n't even explain how my life would be if i did n't have cannabis			0
i would probably be addicted to opiates and in a wheelchair			0
" despite the packed crowds and stands full of marijuana , the farmers market operates in a legal gray zone			1
" medical marijuana is not legal in the state of @entity56 , " said state @entity53 spokesman @entity52			1
a law passed in 1998 allows for what is called the " medical marijuana defense " -- that allows for juries to take into account if someone charged with pot possession was taking the drug for health purposes			1
under the current law , certain health care providers like doctors or nurse practitioner can issue the recommendations for medical marijuana for a variety of ailments including cancer , @entity76 and anorexia			1
but unlike in @entity80 or @entity81 where medical marijuana initiatives led to an explosion of dispensaries that provide the drug , in @entity56 the medical marijuana community has remained , for the most part , underground			1
" dispensaries are not legal , co-ops are not legal here , " @entity87 said			2
" the intent of the law is that you receive medical marijuana from a designated provider who can only help one patient at one time			1
some people are interpreting that as they provide marijuana to someone and then 15 minutes later do it again for another patient			0
" " it 's a city by city , county by county situation right now , " said @entity104 , a spokesman for the sunday market and medical marijuana advocate who says there is still " an old @entity109 " feel to the medical marijuana community in the state			1
in @entity0 , however , medical marijuana users have something of safe haven			2
a 2003 measure officially pegged arresting people for personal use of marijuana as the lowest priority for the city 's police department			0
still fears persist among medical marijuana users			2
at the market , several attendees asked the handful of news crews present not to take images of them			0
one couple said they would lose their jobs as teachers if the school where they worked found out they were at the event			0
" this could be construed as dealing drugs , " medical marijuana grower @entity139 said as a line of customers grew in front of his " @entity146 " stand			0
" we need the state to clarify the gray areas			2
" market organizers said they are hopeful that a bill working its way through @entity56 's legislature will provide medical marijuana users and growers in the state surer legal footing to operate on			1
in the meantime , organizers say they will hold more farmers markets and push for medical marijuana rights -- within limits			1
" we do n't want to be anything like @entity80 , " market spokesman @entity104 said			0
" they literally have dispensaries on top of each other in @entity170 and out in the valley			0

recommendation from a health care provider needed to shop at the farmers market
the market operates in a legal gray zone in the state of @entity56
organizers hope a bill in the state legislature will give medical pot users better legal footing
