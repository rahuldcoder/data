@entity0 -- a planned @entity3 tribute concert , supported by the late pop star 's mother and four siblings , was in disarray thursday amid family squabbling and the apparent failure of promoters to sign any big - name acts so far			1
tickets for the show , scheduled for @entity14 , @entity15 , in october , were to go on sale thursday , but instead of providing a link for purchases the promoter 's website asked fans to " please standby for further announcements			1
" the head of the @entity25 company promoting the concert promised last week it would " feature the world 's most amazing music performers			2
" the roster would be revealed online one act at a time over the next 10 days weeks , @entity30 ceo @entity29 told reporters at a july 25 news conference			2
" everybody 's in the midst of signing contracts so nothing can be announced until that happens , " @entity36 , spokeswoman for @entity30 , told @entity1 late tuesday			1
she suggested an announcement would come wednesday			0
by thursday , still no acts had been announced			2
the problems started soon after brothers @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , sister @entity48 and family matriarch @entity50 attended the " @entity51 : the @entity54 " announcement at the @entity53 on july 25			2
@entity48 said it was " something that 's spectacular " while the @entity57 ' mother called it " a show fit for a king			2
" " if my son were here today , he would feel the same way , " @entity50 said			0
" i know my brother would be very , very proud to see all the artists that he admired and respected so much coming together for this event , " @entity46 said			0
but an hour later , @entity68 and @entity69 , the only brothers not at the news conference , issued a sharply worded statement that reflected a deep division within the @entity72 over the show			1
" we want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family , " the two brothers said in a joint statement			0
" while we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother , we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding @entity3 's death			1
" while @entity29 had hinted it could include a @entity3 brothers reunion , the statement from @entity68 and @entity69 made it clear that would not happen			1
" in light of this , we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill - timed event and its promoter , @entity97 , " @entity69 and @entity91 said			2
their statement said the idea of the october concert was presented to the entire family in april " as an idea already in its advanced stages			0
" the decision to go ahead with it " disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms " by some members of the @entity72 , they said			0
the @entity110 agreed with the two brothers , issuing a similar statement			0
" we share their concerns that this concert is taking place at a most inappropriate time when everyone 's care and attention should be focused on the matter of justice			0
we believe that , as stated by @entity68 and @entity69 , the most important tribute we can give to @entity3 at this time is to seek justice in his name			1
" @entity3 fans posted messages on the concert 's @entity127 page questioning ticket prices and the process for buying them			1
fans must place bids for a chance to buy a ticket			0
the higher their pledge to a charity , the better their chances of getting a good seat			0
" the ticket system is so bad ! ! the higher you bid the better seats you get ? ? not every @entity3 fan is rich ! ! ! " one fan posted on the " @entity145 " @entity127 page thursday			1
after several days of such negative posts , a link to the @entity127 page was removed from the concert 's website			0
the october 8 show , in the @entity152 in @entity14 , which seats 75,000 people , would be at least four hours long , @entity29 said			1
in addition to the other problems surrounding the event , a spokesman for @entity3 's estate said last week that the promoters never sought or obtained permission from the estate 's executors to use late pop singer 's name or image			1
" the estate has not been contacted and is not involved with @entity30 in the @entity169 tribute concert announced today , " spokesman @entity166 told @entity1 .			0
