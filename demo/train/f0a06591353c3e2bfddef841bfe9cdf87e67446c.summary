-- @entity1 is rolling up fast , so we asked for your recommendations for @entity5 ' very best dishes			1
" excess is the new moderation , " one @entity7 proclaimed			1
debatable , but not a bad mantra for a trip to diner 's paradise			1
if you 're not hungry now , you will be			0
oysters every which way tucked into a baguette , charbroiled , fried , smothered in butter and cheese , sprinkled with bacon or just slurped right out of the shell , oysters turn up in many a @entity5 memory			1
the charbroiled variety from @entity25 's made a big impression on @entity27 , a @entity29 transplant			1
" the rich butter and garlic mixed with the fresh saltwater taste of the oyster is heaven			0
and before you know it -- the oysters are gone			2
but that wonderful butter and herb sauce remains , waiting for you to soak it up with the @entity43 bread			0
" @entity45 's @entity44 gets @entity47 's vote			2
" @entity49 served ice cold on the half shell , chargrilled and sizzling in garlic butter or fried to golden perfection , @entity45 's oysters are some of the best you 'll ever have , " @entity47 said			1
@entity55 : what not to do during @entity57 there 's nothing better than the standard oyster po ' boy , " dressed , lots of @entity62 , " said @entity63 of @entity64 , @entity65			2
she likes @entity66 's , @entity67 's , @entity68 's and @entity69 for sandwiches			2
" the wonderful thing about @entity5 cuisine is it really does n't matter if you have $ 100 to spend or $ 10 , you can always get something truly special , " she said			1
local @entity75 goes just blocks from his home in @entity77 to @entity78 's for the " most stupendously crisp and fresh oyster po ' boys ! " a proper po ' boy requires lightly toasted @entity43 bread , real butter , crisp lettuce and pickles , thin - sliced tomato and " most of all , freshly fried oysters , " @entity75 wrote in his @entity88			1
@entity1 beyond bare breasts a sandwich known ' round the world @entity93 ' boys are n't the only world - famous sandwiches to come out of the @entity5			1
the @entity69 on @entity96 is widely touted as the source of the original muffuletta , a sandwich of layered @entity101 meats , cheeses and olive salad on a flat round loaf of muffuletta bread			0
the sandwich has been replicated and interpreted , but @entity47 calls the @entity69 's sandwich " definitive			2
" " yes , other restaurants now make fatter ones on artisan breads with more exotic cold cuts and fancier ingredients in the olive salad , but @entity116 's muffuletta has a classic dignity that simply can not be bettered , " she said			2
@entity55 : lick - the - screen muffuletta @entity121 of @entity122 urges diners to order a whole sandwich to stave off regrets			0
" no other sandwich is so perfectly designed for proportion , texture and combination of tastes			0
" he 's a fan of really communing with the muffuletta , so he suggests taking it back to your hotel room , " where you can have a private experience with the sandwich , away from the eyes of strangers , " he wrote on @entity88			2
" by the time you 're ready to walk around , cocktail hour should be creeping up on the @entity144			0
a cold @entity145 and a few oysters sounds lovely			2
give in , " @entity147 advised			0
@entity55 : what we ate in @entity5 more fruits of the sea @entity152 had an unforgettable taste of her husband 's crab cake pasta at @entity156			1
" it was so rich and creamy , just the right amount of seafood flavor to it , " she said			0
" we have tried to replicate it at home with no success so far , " said @entity152 , who lives in @entity160 , @entity161			0
the alligator sausage cheesecake appetizer at @entity166 's received two ireporter endorsements			2
@entity168 of @entity169 , @entity170 , called it " inexplicable			0
" @entity172 of @entity173 , @entity174 , went for it with this description : " the look on everyone 's face at the table was the same , ' damn ! ' -- eyes wide , mouths full and forks going in for seconds			2
the texture was smoother than a quiche , yet not as rich as the traditional cheesecake and the alligator sausage gave the right amount of bite			0
" when he 's in @entity5 , former @entity29 resident @entity191 always stops at @entity192 for the cajun pasta , a spicy creamy dish featuring crawfish , oysters , shrimp , artichoke hearts , mushrooms and cajun @entity200			1
he calls this " little dive " of a restaurant the city 's best - kept secret			2
for true home cooking , @entity205 recommends @entity207 in @entity208 , @entity29 , about an hour 's drive from the @entity5 airport			1
" i make the drive to @entity207 because it feels like having dinner at my momma 's house			2
and that 's saying something , " said @entity205 , who lives in @entity215 , @entity29			0
@entity5 : the food that got them through a cloud of powdered sugar what 's not to love about fried things doused in powdered sugar ? the famous @entity225 , established in 1862 , popped up several times among @entity88 contributors			1
beignets , @entity43 - style square doughnuts , are the main attraction , but coffee mixed with chicory is a natural complement			0
" do n't get me wrong , i love étouffée , gumbo , po ' boys , muffuletta , but i got ta have my oysters and beignets , " said @entity234 , who lives in the @entity236 suburbs			1
more sweet treats for a more unusual , sucré salé treat , head to @entity246			0
" the standout , not - to - be - missed creation i 'm crazy about is the bacon sundae , " said @entity247 of @entity248			0
she tucked into this concoction -- pecan praline ice cream drizzled with bacon caramel sauce , topped with @entity256 bacon and whipped cream -- instead of cake on her 35th birthday			0
and of course bananas @entity260 , bread pudding and pralines are well - loved @entity5 standards			1
see the gallery above for recommendations on where to indulge in those			0
breaking away from the local standards when you 've had more oysters , crawfish and beignets than you can bear , veer away from tradition and make new ones			1
the dining scene in @entity5 is always evolving with fresh twists on the classics and totally original dishes			1
" now really , about all you have to do is walk or drive down the street until you see an eatery			0
go inside and 99.9 % of the time you will be delighted ! " wrote former @entity5 resident @entity284			1
@entity55 : the great gumbo debate very fine eateries rub shoulders with casual favorites			0
@entity290 has earned hearty praise from @entity292 , who first encountered this hole - in - the - wall bar 's tremendous burger with baked potato before her wedding in december 1995			1
" every year since , my husband @entity297 and i make sure we get down to @entity5 to enjoy it again			1
" " get it loaded or ' dressed , ' as they say in @entity5 , " said @entity292 , who lives in @entity300 , @entity301			1
@entity304 of @entity305 , @entity170 , offered another rave for a well - loved sandwich : the @entity308			0
she found a very tasty version at @entity310 , a hybrid sandwich shop , butcher and wine bar			0
people go to @entity5 for gumbo , or red beans , or beignets			1
but when you get tired of that and just want something simple and delicious , head to @entity310			0

oysters every which way rank high with @entity5 *visitors*
standards such as @entity225 's beignets are still favorites
for an *excellent* burger , head to @entity290 , says one @entity7
