@entity2 the @entity1 military is trying to gather as much intelligence as it can about @entity6 defenses in @entity7 to make a key decision about whether it 's necessary to recommend @entity1 ground troops accompany @entity11 forces on the looming fight to retake @entity11 's second largest city			1
the first move by @entity11 forces on the ground could come as soon as april , a @entity15 official told @entity3			1
@entity6 is continuing to attempt to reinforce its defenses of @entity7			1
if those defenses grow to a significant level , then @entity11 forces may need @entity1 help in locating military targets to hit , the official said			1
if @entity6 defenses reach that critical point , the @entity25 and @entity15 may then recommend to president @entity28 that @entity1 troops be involved , the official said			1
gen. @entity31 , head of @entity15 , and gen. @entity33 , chairman of the @entity34 , have both suggested a small number of @entity1 troops could be needed to help with targeting , but not to go into combat			0
now there is a more specific explanation of the trigger — @entity6 defenses — that could cause the recommendation to go to the president			0
the @entity1 already is observing @entity6 members protecting their families by sending them out of @entity7 , the official said			1
recent coalition airstrikes around @entity7 have been aimed at cutting off all supply lines to @entity6 in the city			0
that way , when the military operation begins , @entity6 will be isolated inside @entity7 and unable to reinforce its fighters			2
@entity15 believes @entity6 has lost the ability to gain significant new amounts of territory in @entity11 and hold onto it , the official said			2
and in both @entity11 and @entity57 , the assessment is that @entity6 fighters are stretched so thin , leaders are having to make choices and prioritize where they want to put their resources and fighters , the official added			2
that became a key reason they abandoned the fight for @entity68			0
there is also some evidence that the number of foreign fighters coming into @entity57 and @entity11 may have declined over the last four to five months			0
however , hostage killings videos do underscore that the @entity6 social media propaganda campaign remains strong , the official said			0
@entity1 military and intelligence officials are noting the highly produced nature of some of the videos indicate @entity6 had spent considerable time on the efforts .			0

@entity11 forces could begin to move to retake @entity7 as soon as april , a @entity1 official says
@entity6 is continuing to try to reinforce its defenses of @entity7
