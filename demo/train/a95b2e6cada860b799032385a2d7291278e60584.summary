-- @entity1 began to cut off natural gas supplies to @entity3 on monday as talks over unpaid debts continued , @entity1 state media reported			1
president @entity7 gave the order for @entity1 energy giant @entity9 to start restricting gas supplies , company ceo @entity11 said , according to official @entity1 news agency @entity13			2
@entity11 said the cut , which began monday , will be " gradual , daily and proportional to the volume of debt			0
" @entity3 has refused to pay @entity1 gas rates of $ 169 per 1,000 cubic meters for the first quarter of the year and $ 185 for the second quarter , @entity13 reported			2
the former @entity21 republic has instead been paying $ 150 since jan. 1 , ringing up a large debt in the process			0
@entity1 's action could hurt customers farther down the pipeline			0
@entity3 has said it will be technologically unable to ensure complete natural gas transit to @entity29 , if @entity1 cuts gas supplies to @entity3 by 85 percent , state media reported			1
in the past , other countries including @entity32 , @entity33 , the @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 have complained that their gas supplies have been affected as @entity1 trimmed output to upstream customers like @entity3 and @entity42			2
@entity9 is the world 's biggest producer and exporter of natural gas -- and @entity1 's most powerful company			1
it controls 20 percent of the world 's natural gas reserves and operates the world 's largest gas distribution network covering an area from @entity29 to the @entity53 , according to its website			1
@entity9 exports energy to 32 countries and provides around 25 percent of the @entity58 's gas supplies			2
formed in 1989 to replace the @entity59 of the @entity60 , @entity9 is closely tied to the @entity1 government , which owns a controlling 50 percent stake in the company			0
@entity7 is a former @entity9 chairman			0
in recent years , an increasingly confident @entity64 has used @entity9 to assert its authority over @entity1 's former sphere of influence by offering heavily subsidized gas to @entity70 countries			1
but that policy has led to disputes as @entity9 has then sought to raise prices			0
@entity9 has switched off gas supplies to another former republic -- @entity42 -- several times in recent years in a row over payments and @entity80 's rejection of proposals to hike rates			0
those disputes ended earlier this year when @entity1 agreed to a 30 percent drop in the price of natural gas sold to @entity42 , in exchange for permission to extend @entity1 's lease of a major naval base in the @entity92 port of @entity93 , @entity42 , for 25 years .			1

new : @entity3 says it ca *n't* guarantee natural gas transit to @entity29
talks to continue over debts owed to @entity1 by @entity3
