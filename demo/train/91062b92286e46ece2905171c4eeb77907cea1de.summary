-- in case you have n't noticed , president @entity1 has been flexing his executive muscles lately			1
on paper , it 's a head - scratcher			1
after all , he lost control of the @entity9 in the last election			0
his popularity is hovering near an all - time low			1
and , of course , he 's a lame duck			0
only no one seems to have told him			0
it 's as if he has shed his @entity17 - ish demeanor for the more flamboyant cape			1
he 's no @entity19 , to be sure , but he 's spending an awful lot of time lately trying to get off the ground			0
so , after suffering a political shellacking , he 's showing he still has some muscle , using executive authority everywhere he believes he can			2
president @entity25 famously declared his relevance , months after losing control of the @entity28 in 1994			2
@entity1 , on the other hand , is literally leaping into unilateral action : on immigration ! on climate change ! on regulating the @entity33 ! on @entity34 ! " i 'm energized , " said a buoyant president in his year - end press conference , friday			1
" i 'm excited about the prospects for the next couple of years			0
and i 'm certainly not going to be stopping for a minute ... " translation : this is the new , all - drama @entity1			1
and all of that pent - up energy , ambition and action , barely two months after losing control of the @entity9			2
" anyone would become annoyed and frustrated if you were accused of being a wuss , " says a senior @entity47 policy adviser			0
" and it 's always better to be on offense than defense			0
" it was n't exactly a state secret that @entity1 had a lot on his to - do list after the election			1
the thinking , according to a knowledgeable source : he felt constrained and frustrated by his tactical responsibilities to @entity47 in trouble			0
do n't rock the boat			2
do n't make democrats take hard votes			2
do n't even campaign in red states			2
and , as it turns out , the restraint helped not one whit			0
so now , with the clock ticking , he 's moved from party cheerleader to the head of the executive branch			2
it 's @entity75 , with or without the @entity76			0
at the press conference today , the president strongly hinted at a veto of the @entity80 -- so take that @entity81 and red - state @entity47			1
and he wants tax reform , too			0
@entity84 is the season for a presidential list , and he 's checking it twice -- as his legacy looms			0
everything he is doing redefines the very notion of a lame duck			0
but here 's what this flurry of activity also defines : the 2016 presidential race			2
in forcing the @entity34 issue front and center , for instance , @entity81 presidential wannabes have to respond			1
so , too , on @entity1 's moves on immigration			1
all sorts of new tests of conservative loyalty are being created by these moves			2
and some candidates could find themselves pushed in a direction they might not otherwise go			0
for instance , parse the differences between @entity81 pre-presidential candidates @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 on @entity1 's @entity34 deal			1
@entity111 called the president the " single worst negotiator we have had in the @entity28 in my lifetime			2
" @entity112 did not like the deal , but stopped short of name - calling			0
" i do n't think we should be negotiating with a repressive regime , " @entity112 said -- a long way from @entity111 's accusation that the president was " willfully ignorant " and " naÃ ¯ ve			1
" and @entity113 went even further in @entity1 's direction , saying , " opening up @entity34 is probably a good idea			1
" in appealing to the younger @entity130 - @entity129 demographic , @entity1 is making the @entity81 choose sides			1
and he 's gambling that the numbers are with him			0
eventually , @entity47 will have to do the same			0
if @entity1 's audacity turns out to be misdirected , @entity133 will have to explain -- and likely defend -- it			1
if he 's not pro-active enough , the @entity137 wing of the party will react			0
it 's a @entity140 © that presidential campaigns are generally defined by the president who served before			0
@entity1 is actively making sure that 's the case			1
but there 's one caveat in this new , muscular , pro-active @entity1 - world : it just might lead to higher expectations			1
which is exactly where @entity1 began -- and then faded .			1

@entity152 : @entity1 uses executive powers *aggressively* despite electoral losses
she says @entity1 does n't have to soft - pedal his stances , since he faces no more elections
@entity1 has acted on immigration , climate change and @entity34 in a matter of weeks
@entity152 : the moves are going to *scramble* the races for president in 2016
