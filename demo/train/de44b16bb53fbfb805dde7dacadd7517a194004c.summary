nurse @entity0 has cut a deal with authorities that permits her to travel , more or less freely , while monitoring her health			1
but @entity0 , who recently returned to the @entity4 after treating @entity6 patients in @entity7 , says she wo n't go into town where she lives or public places , even though she 's allowed			1
" the truth is i completely understand that this town has been through a lot and there 's still a lot of fears and misinformation out there			0
i think we need to start addressing those issues , " she told @entity20 's " @entity19 " on monday night			2
" it 's also true that i only moved here to @entity23 , @entity24 , in august			0
so , you know , there are a lot of people who do n't know me			0
i 'm still an outsider , and i just sort of want to respect their wishes , " she said			0
on friday , a judge in @entity24 ruled in favor of @entity0 , who defied a quarantine in a tense standoff with state authorities			1
@entity39 chief judge @entity38 said local health officials failed to prove the need for a stricter order enforcing an @entity6 quarantine , and ordered @entity0 to submit to " direct active monitoring , " coordinate travel with public health officials and immediately notify health authorities should symptoms appear			1
weighing returning @entity6 workers ' liberty , public safety @entity24 authorities had wanted @entity0 to stay home for the remainder of a 21 - day period -- the incubation time for the deadly virus -- following her return to the @entity4 , although she has tested negative for the disease and has shown no symptoms			1
" there is no science behind it with this disease , " she told @entity20 about quarantine			1
" we know that @entity6 is not transmitted as easily as many other diseases and that self - monitoring and even an enhanced version , which is what most states in the @entity4 are going to now ... this will work , " @entity0 said			1
she first made news when she returned from a month working with @entity74			0
@entity0 had an elevated temperature at an airport in @entity78 , @entity79 , officials said			2
she was put into an isolation tent			0
she blasted @entity79 gov. @entity81 for enforcing a new policy that required anyone showing symptoms of @entity6 , including an elevated temperature , to be isolated			2
" the biggest reason that i fought is because i , you know , felt so much fear and confusion , and i imagined what my fellow aid workers were going to feel if they came back to this same situation -- and the more i thought about the fact that these policies are being made by politicians , really not the experts in the field -- the more i felt like i had no choice but to fight back , " @entity0 said			2
the ruling in @entity24 just applies in her case			0
it has no bearing for anyone else possibly returning from working with @entity6 patients in @entity105 , which is why @entity0 believes more work must be done			1
" i 'd like to see more leadership at the national level as well			0
we really need evidence - based policies and these knee - jerk reactions , you know , they 're just not being well thought out , " she said			1
" the fight is not over			0
" ebola outbreak : get up to speed			0
