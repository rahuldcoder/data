editors ' note : below is an excerpt from @entity5 's new autobiography " @entity7 " published by @entity6			1
@entity5 anchors " @entity8 at 9 p.m. et on @entity9			1
in 1959 , @entity10 , left , was @entity5 's first major guest on his @entity12 radio program			1
@entity13 left @entity14 , @entity15 , for @entity16 , @entity17 , at the age of 23 to try to find a job in radio			1
this is how he got his new name : i went to stay with my @entity24 in @entity16			1
i was so excited that i started knocking on doors the next day			1
i stopped at a small station on @entity27 , @entity28			1
the guy in charge liked my voice			2
" we get a lot of people coming and going , " he told me			2
" if you hang around , you 'll get the first opening			2
" i sat and watched in fascination for a few weeks			2
it was a tiny operation , but the sight of the @entity41 and @entity42 machines furiously clicking out news made me feel like i was on the brink of something big			2
@entity16 was like a dream			1
i remember walking past @entity49			2
@entity51 's is more than a restaurant , it 's a landmark			2
it was full when i arrived in 1957 , and i guarantee you , people will be waiting in line tomorrow night			1
i stopped outside the front window with only a few dollars in my pocket , unable to afford a meal , looking at the happy faces , wondering what it would take to get into a place like that			1
then came my big break			2
there was a morning deejay named @entity68			2
he was making sixty dollars a week and his alimony was sixty - five			1
he claimed to be living off the coconuts falling from trees			2
he quit on a friday , and the general manager told me i could start on monday			2
i must have rehearsed the entire weekend			2
i do n't even think i slept			2
on monday morning i showed up at @entity28 with the record that would play my theme song , " @entity75			0
" the general manager called me into his office to wish me good luck			1
" by the way , " he said , " what name are you going to use ? " " what do you mean ? " " you ca n't use @entity13 , " he said			1
" it 's too ethnic			1
people wo n't be able to spell it or remember it			0
you need a better name			0
" there was no time to think about whether this was good or bad or what my mother would say			1
i was going on the air in five minutes			1
the @entity96 was spread out on his desk			0
face - up was a full - page ad for @entity5 's @entity101			1
the general manager looked down and said , " @entity5 ! how about @entity5 ? " " ok , " i said			1
this was the opportunity of a lifetime			0
i was n't going to blow it			0
you 'll host the @entity8			0
" nine o'clock was approaching			0
that 's when the news came on			0
a few minutes later , the @entity8 would make its debut			0
i went through the control - room door , sat down , and set up my record			1
i started my theme song , then faded down the music so i could introduce myself			0
it was as dry as cotton			0
for the first time in my life , i could n't speak			1
so i brought " @entity124 " up again and faded it once more			0
again , not a single word came out of my mouth			0
i could only wonder if listeners were hearing the pounding of my heart			0
i 'd waited for this moment my whole life			0
how could i be blowing it ? once more , i cranked up " @entity75 " -- but not a word came out of me			0
the next thing i knew , the general manager was kicking open the door to the control room			0
" this is a communications business ! " he roared in a way that only a general manager can			0
then he turned , walked out , and slammed the door behind him			0
@entity140 , i leaned in to the microphone and said , " good morning			0
this is my first day ever on the radio			1
i 've always wanted to be on the air			1
i 've been practicing all weekend			0
a few minutes ago , they gave me my new name			0
i 've had a theme song ready to play , but my mouth is dry			0
and the general manager just kicked open the door and said , ' this is a communications business ! ' " that 's how my career started on may 1 , 1957			1
years later , @entity155 would tell me , " the only secret in this business is ... there is no secret			0
i learned a great lesson on my first day			1
there 's no trick to being yourself			0
i do n't think i 've ever been nervous on the air since then .			1
