does terrorism ever work ? 9/11 was an enormous tactical success for @entity3 , partly because it involved attacks that took place in the media capital of the world and the actual capital of the @entity9 , thereby ensuring the widest possible coverage of the event			1
if terrorism is a form of theater where you want a lot of people watching , no event in human history was likely ever seen by a larger global audience than the 9/11 attacks			1
at the time , there was much discussion about how @entity24 was like the attack on @entity26			2
they were indeed similar since they were both surprise attacks that drew @entity9 into significant wars			0
but they were also similar in another sense			2
@entity26 was a great tactical success for @entity34 , but it led to great strategic failure : within four years of @entity26 the @entity37 empire lay in ruins , utterly defeated			2
similarly , @entity24 was a great tactical success for @entity3 , but it also turned out be a great strategic failure for @entity42			1
on 9/11 @entity42 's main strategic goal was to overthrow regimes across the @entity45 and to replace them with @entity47 - style rule			1
he believed that the best way to accomplish this was to attack the " far enemy " ( the @entity9 ) and then watch as the @entity9 - backed @entity51 regimes he termed the " near enemy " toppled			2
this might have worked if the @entity9 really was the paper tiger that @entity42 believed it to be , but not only did @entity42 not achieve his war aims , the 9/11 attacks resulted in the direct opposite of his goal of forcing a @entity9 withdrawal from @entity63 lands			1
after 9/11 , @entity9 soldiers occupied both @entity65 and @entity66 , and @entity3 -- " the base " in @entity68 -- lost the best base it ever had : @entity65 as it had existed before the overthrow of the @entity47 by @entity9 forces in late 2001			2
in short , @entity42 's violent tactics did not serve his strategic goals , and @entity3 's violence became only an end in itself			1
that is where @entity78 is today			1
its strategy is incoherent because only a tiny minority of @entity83 want to live in the @entity47 - style utopia that @entity78 wants to bring to the @entity63 world , while at the same time @entity78 ' principal victims are fellow @entity83 who do n't share their views to the letter			1
this is a decidedly mixed message for a group that presents itself as the defender of @entity83			0
indeed , the burning to death of the @entity95 pilot @entity96 is an indelible image that will long serve to undercut any @entity78 claim to be the defender of @entity63			1
that said , could @entity78 ' campaign of brutal terrorism work to bring its goal of a @entity47 - style caliphate across the @entity45 ? if one examines other significant campaigns of terrorism in the modern era , the historical record suggests that this is quite unlikely			1
anarchists in the early 20th century carried out a number of high - profile assassinations and bombings			0
in 1901 , for instance , an anarchist killed @entity9 president @entity116			0
and in 1920 an anarchist blew up a bomb - laden wagon on @entity120 , killing more than 30 , which was the deadliest act of terrorism in @entity123 until 9/11			1
anarchists termed these kinds of high - profile attacks " the propaganda of the deed			0
" yet they achieved nothing with these attacks , and their ideology has withered and largely died out			0
the @entity132 in @entity133 was a group of @entity135 - inspired terrorists who during the 1970s and 1980s killed more than 30 people , a number of whom were prominent @entity133 government officials and businessmen as well as @entity9 military personnel , yet this campaign also achieved absolutely nothing			0
one could also make the same observation for other @entity146 leftist terrorist groups of the same era , such as the @entity148			0
indeed , there are few campaigns of terrorism that have succeeded in bringing about their political objectives , but in some cases terrorism can actually work			0
this is the big , uncomfortable takeaway of an important new book , " @entity158 : the struggle for @entity160 1917 - 1947 , " about the era that led up to the creation of @entity160 , written by the leading @entity9 terrorism expert , @entity163			1
@entity163 demonstrates that @entity165 terrorism helped to push the @entity167 occupiers out of @entity168 after @entity175 indeed , @entity169 , the leader of the @entity171 group that played an instrumental role in the @entity165 terrorist campaign against @entity167 and @entity51 targets , went on to become the prime minister of israel and shared in a @entity177			0
some 300 miles from where the @entity95 pilot was believed to have been burned alive by @entity78 , almost seven decades ago two soldiers were hanged from a tree in the land that is now called @entity160			1
the soldiers were @entity167 and the executioners were @entity165 militants whose overall commander was begin			0
the burning to death of the @entity95 pilot was , of course , particularly abhorrent , but the hanging deaths of the two @entity167 soldiers in 1947 were greeted with as much outrage in the @entity167 as the pilot 's death has had in @entity95			0
but after the killings of the @entity167 soldiers an unexpected thing happened			0
the @entity167 , who had endured a campaign of terrorist attacks in @entity168 , including the attack on @entity203 's iconic @entity202 that killed 91 soldiers and civilians , did n't double down on their occupation of @entity168			1
instead , they washed their hands of it and packed up their bags and left , leading to the formation of the state of @entity160 in 1948			0
the emerging scholarly consensus is that campaigns of terrorism can sometimes work to achieve the goal of forcing the withdrawal of a colonial power as happened with the @entity167 in @entity168 , but more often than not terrorism does n't succeed as a tactic to achieve the strategic goals of terrorist groups , whether they are @entity135 in orientation , or ultra-fundamentalist jihadists			2
instead , all too often violence becomes an end in itself for the terrorist organization , which then loses any legitimacy that it might have once had and is eventually wiped out by military or police action			0
that is the position that @entity78 now finds itself in with its killing of the @entity95 pilot			2

@entity235 : most of the time , terrorism becomes self - defeating
he says @entity42 's strategy involving 9/11 was a failure
@entity78 strategy also does n't make sense , @entity235 says
