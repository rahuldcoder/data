@entity2 , @entity3 sen. @entity1 is on track to run for president if he decides to jump in the race , an aide tells @entity4			1
a presidential bid is n't the definite next move for the senator , who 's also up for reelection in 2016 and has said he 'll only run for one office â € ” but for many of his donors and supporters attending his two - day summit in @entity2 , it 's the obvious one			1
attendees were given the impression by @entity1 and his aides that while the senator has n't made a decision yet , he has prepared the funding and staffing infrastructure to go all in			1
and speaking to some audience members who were listening , the pitch worked			0
" i 'm very taken with him , " said @entity27 , an ambassador under @entity28 and a major @entity30 fundraiser who supported @entity32 in 2012			0
convincing his financial backers that he has the campaign organization to launch a 2016 bid at a moment 's notice is important as @entity1 's would - be primary challengers have been more public and direct about their intentions for weeks now			1
while the freshman @entity3 senator gathered donors and staff at the posh @entity46 hotel , at least 10 @entity48 hopefuls were addressing potential @entity50 caucus - goers and former governors @entity52 and @entity32 criss - crossed the country meeting with voters and @entity48 officials			1
back in @entity2 , @entity56 said that while he has n't decided who to support in the @entity30 primary , he was impressed by @entity1 's command of the foreign policy challenges facing the nation and , in particular , the senator 's charisma and compelling personal story			1
" he 's extremely articulate , " @entity56 said			0
" someone who 's going to be president has to be able to lead			2
and you have to be articulate to be able to lead			0
" @entity56 was one of nearly 300 donors and supporters gathered at the hotel on friday night and saturday morning for the senator 's annual " @entity74 " meeting			1
attendees included @entity76 , former chairman of the @entity77 and a supporter of both @entity1 and @entity52 ; @entity79 , chair of @entity1 's @entity81 steering committee ; @entity82 , a major @entity1 donor , and @entity84 , a @entity81 lobbyist and a member of @entity1 's @entity81 steering committee			1
@entity1 spent nearly three hours friday night chatting individually with attendees , telling jokes and stories with them on the candlelit patio after guests enjoyed a buffet dinner and open bar			1
over a breakfast buffet saturday morning , @entity1 told the group about his thinking as he contemplates a presidential run			1
he 's huddling with a few dozen of his top fundraisers and aides over lunch to strategize for his future , and has a more casual dinner planned saturday night with a small circle to continue the conversation			2
according to multiple attendees at the breakfast briefing , @entity1 said he 'd make the decision sooner rather than later , as he wants to give @entity48 in the state enough time to front a strong candidate to defend his seat if he does decide to go for the @entity112			1
@entity113 , @entity1 's former chief of staff who now runs his pac , also gave a powerpoint presentation to the group outlining the senator 's midterm efforts and successes , introducing the attendees to the new @entity48 their money helped elect in 2014			2
aides caution that @entity1 has n't made up his mind yet , and that these preparations will be just as useful for a @entity125 campaign if he decides to run for reelection			1
@entity3 @entity48 are expecting to face a fierce battle with @entity128 to hold onto the seat regardless of who they run , because it 's both a top pickup opportunity for @entity128 hoping to take back the @entity125 , and a key swing state in the electoral college calculus			2
@entity76 predicted the @entity125 fight alone could top $ 100 million			0
" @entity3 's going to be the number one state in a presidential election and in the @entity125 election , and whether you 're running for reelection in the @entity125 in a race that could cost 100 million , or you 're running for president , you need an incredible effort just for the reelection , " he said			1
" so if you do n't start working on that now , you 're not going to be able to amass the resources you need			0
" @entity1 's well on track to amass those resources			2
the senator had a record january fundraising haul , beating all of his goals , according to an aide			0
and he 's on track to surpass his february goals as well , with fundraising trips to @entity156 and @entity157 planned for next month			0
he recently brought on @entity158 , the top fundraiser for major @entity30 spending group @entity160 , as his finance director , though his current finance director , @entity163 , will still be active in the team 's fundraising efforts			0
still , many in the party remain skeptical of a first - term senator who 's still haunted , in some conservative circles , by his role in negotiating the failed @entity125 immigration reform bill in 2013			1
that which both lost him support within the conservative wing in the party and raised questions about his ability to effectively govern			0
he was one of a handful of potential 2016 contenders who skipped out on a conservative gathering hosted by @entity30 rep. @entity181 this weekend â € ” a snub that did not go unnoticed by @entity181 , who told the crowd he believed the country 's next president was one of the speakers at the confab			2
but @entity1 's own team does n't believe immigration will be an issue for him in the race , if he runs			1
they note the senator 's got strong credentials on nearly every other key conservative issue , including gun control and abortion , and see the immigration snafu as a mulligan of sorts that conservatives could forgive			0
and his supporters believe he 's got the charisma and compelling personal story that many other potential contenders lack			0
@entity56 , who 's hosted fundraising dinners at his home that have netted candidates upwards of a million dollars , said he has yet to decide which @entity48 to support			0
but between @entity1 and @entity28 , the younger senator may have won his heart			2
" i 'm certainly leaning very heavily towards @entity1 , or possibly @entity52 â € ” but i really like @entity1			2
he 's a really talented guy , " @entity56 said			0
" he 's got a good inner self too			0
he 's comfortable in his own skin , " he added .			0

@entity1 has the campaign organization ready to run for president , an aide tells @entity4
he told supporters at a two - day meeting in @entity2 he plans to decide sooner rather than later
aides say they 're not *concerned* about his role in the immigration reform effort in 2013
