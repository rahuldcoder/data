-- after my 7 - year - old daughter 's sleepover and a few hours before my 9 - year - old son 's play date , and just in the middle of quieting my daughter 's whining about her impending piano lesson last saturday morning , i stumbled upon " why @entity15 moms are superior , " @entity12 's @entity11 article that 's created a firestorm			1
the article was excerpted from her new book , " @entity19			0
" watch @entity12 defend her methods of parenting @entity12 , a second generation @entity22 , mother of two and @entity25 professor , argues that @entity15 moms churn out whip - smart kids precisely because they do n't allow childhood frivolity like sleepovers or play dates , along with just about everything else that is social , fun or distracting , including tv , video games , sleepaway camp and auditioning for the school play			1
they also insist that their children master the violin or piano -- but only those two instruments -- be the top student in every subject with the exception of gym or drama , and receive no grade below an @entity46 let 's be honest , @entity47 would also relish these dazzling results -- valedictorian and violin virtuosity -- but ca n't imagine themselves , or their kids , committing to the rigid @entity15 @entity54 - style method to guarantee perfection			1
but more importantly , @entity56 , and in particular working moms , just do n't have the time , energy , or well , discipline			1
the " @entity54 " theory is that nothing is fun until you 're good at it			0
and to get good at anything , you have to work hard			0
" on their own , " @entity12 writes , " children never want to work , which is why it is crucial to override their preferences			1
" this is where @entity56 parents fail , she says , by letting our kids give up too quickly			2
we simply do n't have the fortitude or patience to push through our children 's resistance			2
maybe modern day parenting in @entity83 has become too permissive			1
maybe we 've gotten too soft			0
we coddle and cajole our children as we gently nudge them passive aggressively to do their chores and their homework			0
" will you please put your clothes away ? " " let 's study for your spelling test now , ok ? " " @entity91 , can you please turn off the tv and do your 15 minutes of assigned homework reading ? " seriously , 15 minutes			2
even that 's positioned as a question , not a demand			2
go to any school today with a " progressive " philosophy and administrators proudly espouse the virtues of addressing the " whole child " and creating an independent , creative , empathetic individual			0
these are the buzz words that resonate with @entity56 parents			0
it 's true , we want happy , well adjusted , well rounded children who will contribute to society			2
we also buy into the theory that creativity , critical thinking and social skills are essential for future success			0
yes , our kids need to excel at algebra , but we want them to not only learn , but to also enjoy learning in a stimulating environment where they can thrive in their own uniqueness			2
rote learning is out ; individual exploration is in			0
@entity12 condemns these methods as @entity56 foolishness			1
drill and kill , practice until perfect -- this is the @entity15 @entity54 way			1
" tenacious practice , practice , practice is crucial for excellence ; rote repetition is underrated in @entity83 , " @entity12 writes			1
but in our @entity56 style of enjoying and embracing , where children always expect warm fuzzies and trophies , even if they actually stink , have we become parental enablers to laziness and mediocrity ? the @entity56 touchy - feely approach runs counter to the @entity15 @entity54 philosophy			1
@entity12 claims that heaping shame and ridicule on her children drives them to success			1
in her world , insults motivate			0
praise only comes with perfection			0
" you are garbage ! " @entity12 once screamed at her daughter @entity151			1
for @entity15 moms , a less - than - perfect child is a disgrace to the family , a slap - in - the - face to the parents -- utter shame			1
after all , @entity15 moms are in the trenches , toiling for hours to ensure excellence -- anything short becomes almost pathologically personal			1
@entity56 moms just do n't get this			2
maybe it 's because we are not as wholly entrenched			2
how can we be ? we simply do n't have time			2
do we want our children to succeed academically ? absolutely			0
do we encourage musical competence ? sure			0
but the @entity56 moms i know , particularly working mothers , have neither the desire nor time to run such an extreme household			1
after a day at the office , the last thing a working mom wants to do is come home and turn into the drill sergeant			0
getting kids to do their homework is challenging enough , but tacking on extra hours of mom - generated exercises ? not happening			0
so this is why we outsource			0
it 's more practical and better for everyone to have our kids tutored by anyone but us : college students , teachers , or even folks at any of the multitude of educational centers that have sprouted across the country			1
we 're not lazy ; we 're just exhausted			0
and during the time we do have to spend at home with our kids , we 'd rather not battle			2
there are also soccer and baseball games to get to			0
i think @entity56 moms are a little envious of at least part of the @entity15 mom method			1
the academic excellence and tightly wound discipline and parental respect are breathtaking , if not a little frightening			0
but what is the end game ? your child prodigy performing at @entity209 at age 14 as @entity12 's daughter did ? maybe that was worth missing all of the sleepovers and play dates and summer camp , but then again , maybe not .			1

@entity217 reacts to @entity12 's *editorial* on superiority of @entity15 moms
she says @entity83 working mothers have neither the desire nor time to run an extreme household
