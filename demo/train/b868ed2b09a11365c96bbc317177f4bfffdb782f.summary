-- there was no pretense with @entity3 , and the response to his retirement has been just as honest			1
from president @entity9 to @entity3 's late - night peers , the veteran host of @entity8 ' " @entity7 " has left his fans devastated with his announcement that he plans to hang it up in 2015			1
" there are more than 10 reasons # @entity20 will be missed , " the president posted to his @entity16 account thursday , with a photo of himself laughing it up with @entity3			1
" @entity23 is the best there is and ever was , " @entity22 's @entity21 chimed in thursday			1
" there 's a tear under the @entity8 eye ! " said @entity25			0
" @entity29 ! ! ! " " it 's been 31 incredible years , " said @entity30			0
" @entity32 wo n't be the same without you , @entity3			1
" on thursday 's " @entity7 , " @entity3 said that while everything 's been great , he 's simply ready to retire			1
" we do n't have the timing of this precisely down , " he said , " but sometime in the near distant future , 2015 , for the love of @entity40 , @entity41 and i will be wrapping things up and taking a hike			0
" @entity3 announces retirement on his own late night show , @entity47 's @entity46 took a moment to recognize @entity3 's influence			1
" i grew up on @entity3 , " @entity46 , who just recently took over " @entity51 , " told his audience			1
" i was a little too young for ( @entity54 ) @entity53 , i discovered @entity53 in later years online and watching videos that way			0
but @entity3 for me was a show that you had a cool uncle , or one of your friends had a cool older brother that told you to watch			2
... if it was n't for @entity3 , this show would n't exist			2
if it was n't for @entity3 , i would n't be here			2
" it 's @entity3 's comedy world since @entity3 's announcement , the conversation has inevitably turned to who could replace him -- although @entity69 believes that may be impossible			1
but @entity8 , presumably , will have to find someone to take on @entity72 and @entity47 's " @entity73 " at 11:30			0
one obvious option would be to bump @entity8 ' " @entity76 " host @entity75 up an hour , and mimic what @entity47 's done with the handoff of " @entity73			2
" there 's also interesting competition for @entity3 's seat on cable , where @entity83 and @entity84 have proven that they can draw a young audience and hold it			1
and now that @entity88 is reportedly ending her @entity89 late night talk show , " @entity91 " -- hers is another name floating amid the speculation , along with those of other funny ladies like @entity30 and @entity96			0
but the predictions have n't been limited to talk show hosts , as the @entity99 has erupted with suggestions that comics like @entity102 or @entity103 take over			0
the name of a different kind of entertainer showed up in the @entity108 ' take : @entity109			0
and there might be room for the ghost of @entity113 -- a combustible conversationalist who brings the " talk " back to " talk show " -- or some @entity118 talent out there , yet unknown , who gets a " @entity121 " - like chance at stardom			0
@entity124 , for one , is rooting for @entity8 to be the network that breaks up late night 's boys club			0
" i love @entity3 but i am really excited about what this could mean for the diversification of late night , " she tweeted , although she added that she 'll " obvi ... miss @entity3 and his gorgeous tooth scenario / general brilliance			2
" comedic actor @entity134 can see it now , as he promotes another actress , an @entity137 nominee for " @entity138 " : " @entity7 with @entity139			2
" @entity0 's @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
