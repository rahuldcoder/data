he 'd fall on his ass if he tried now			0
" " they knew he was having a problem , " @entity32 said			0
" he needed them for this concert			0
they could have easily told him , ' look , until you go see the appropriate doctor and come back , we 're not going on with the rehearsal			0
' they 're the only ones that really had the ability to do something about it and they chose not to			0
" @entity122 testified this month that he thought @entity9 should have halted production on the show until @entity13 was well			1
mother : ' i want to know what really happened ' despite the e-mail evidence and testimony , @entity15 insisted monday that @entity9 executives knew nothing about @entity13 's failing health			1
" they had little interaction with @entity13 in terms of the production and promotion of that , " @entity15 said , adding that the executives " certainly " did not know " that he was having any problems			2
" but @entity32 said the executives should have known : " he was deteriorating in front of their own eyes			0
" " they watched him waste away , " @entity45 testified			2
@entity13 testified in her first day on the stand friday that she filed the lawsuit " because i want to know what really happened to my son			2
" during cross-examination , the @entity9 lawyer played a clip from an interview she gave to @entity191 a year after her son 's death in which she said @entity13 had hired the doctor			1
in response , her lawyer argued she made the statement before seeing @entity9 e-mails indicating that the company hired him			2
@entity15 questioned her about a statement she and several of her children signed in 2007 accusing @entity202 of publishing " untrue and inaccurate information " about @entity13 's drug use			1
" we categorically deny ever planning , participating in , or having knowledge of any kind of intervention , whatsoever , " the statement read			0
@entity45 acknowledged , however , that she participated in an attempted intervention with her son at his @entity212 in 2002			2
" i wanted them to stop lying , " she testified , referring to the magazine			0
" i was worried about all the lies they were telling about the family			0
" " was it a lie to say your son had a problem with prescription drugs ? " @entity15 asked			0

@entity15 denied he was being overly aggressive in his questioning of her			0
" i just wanted to know the facts from her and there was no reason to be aggressive with her , " he said			0
" she was combative , but you ca n't blame mrs. @entity45 for that			1
none of us want to find ourselves in a situation where we 're having to confront the very public death of our child			0
" @entity15 refused to discuss why he asked @entity45 in the deposition if her husband , @entity264 , ever beat her			2
" what occurred in those depositions was confidential at mrs. @entity45 's request , therefore i am not at liberty to go into to the private matters that we went into in that deposition , " @entity15 told @entity1			2
however , @entity45 and her lawyer both brought up the question in court monday			1
" i am not going to go into what we went into about the very tragic history @entity13 had with his parents and father over the period of his life , " @entity15 said			2
" that is something we did not go into on the stand because it is not relevant			0
i 'm not bringing that up			0
