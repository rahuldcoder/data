-- the fight to point blame in the deadly last voyage of the @entity4 is headed for federal court			1
family members of deckhand @entity7 , one of two @entity4 crew members who died in the sinking , filed a $ 90 million civil lawsuit this week against the owners of the three - masted square - rigger , which appeared in several @entity15 films , including the " @entity17 " franchise			1
the suit alleges the @entity4 was unseaworthy and its captain -- @entity20 -- was negligent when he set sail with his crew of 15 as @entity23 steamed toward the @entity25 @entity24			1
@entity20 was also lost in the shipwreck			1
his body was never recovered after the vessel took on water in stormy seas and sank on october 29			2
wind gusts above 100 mph and waves as high as 30 feet flipped @entity4 on its side , tossing @entity20 and his 15 shipmates into the @entity35 off the coast of @entity37			1
the lawsuit accuses the @entity41 's owners of " intentionally placing the lives of the crew at extreme risk for the sole purpose of financial gain			1
" it also provides detailed examples of allegedly poor maintenance and inadequate crew training , which it says contributed to the sinking and @entity7 's death			2
" as much as i would like to speak my mind , i can not make any comments as of yet , " wrote @entity4 owner @entity53 in an e-mail to @entity0			2
arguably the best - known traditionally rigged wooden 18th - century replica ship in the world , the @entity4 belonged to the @entity60 - based @entity59 , which sailed it from port to port as a tourist attraction			2
@entity7 , a 42 - year - old former teen beauty queen , had been hired as a @entity4 deckhand just five months before			1
it was her first job aboard a ship			0
the bounty was a replica of the 18th - century @entity71 vessel that was rocked by an infamous mutiny			0
@entity73 , drawn by the romance and adventure surrounding wooden sailing ships , claimed to be a descendent of @entity4 mutineer @entity78			2
during her college days , she cheered for the @entity81 as one of its song girls			0
@entity73 also launched a doll - making company			0
at one point , she co-owned a bar in @entity88			0
the idea of crewing on a tall ship dawned on her after she visited a replica of @entity94 ' famous wooden vessel @entity92			0
her shipmates aboard the @entity4 grew to like her always upbeat personality			2
read more about @entity73 and the final voyage of the bounty the lawsuit comes three months after @entity100 and @entity101 launched hearings aimed at learning what contributed to the sinking			0
crew members testified that @entity106 knowingly set sail toward @entity23 from @entity108 , @entity109 , en route to @entity111 , @entity112			0
he 's featured in a @entity115 video where @entity20 explains how to " get a good ride " out of a hurricane , by sailing " as close to the eye of it as you can			2
" " we chase hurricanes , " @entity20 said in the video			0
multiple witnesses also testified that the captain chose to sail knowing there was rot infesting the key parts of the @entity41 , including the ships wooden ribs -- known as the frames			0
@entity53 , representing the @entity41 's owners , declined to testify at the hearing , pleading their @entity133 right to avoid self - incrimination			1
the storm that broke records -- and hearts the lawsuit alleges the owners and @entity20 committed " negligence " and acts of " reckless conduct " by " ignoring unmistakable evidence of rot and deterioration " and the " clear adverse consequences of concealment rather than proper corrective repairs			1
" two days after leaving @entity109 , heavy seas from the approaching storm increased seawater leaking into the ship			0
the rising water began to overwhelm @entity4 's pumps			1
later , the ship 's generators and engines failed , leaving the @entity41 at the mercy of @entity23 's fury			1
built in 1960 as the featured prop in the @entity163 film " @entity164 , " the 108 - foot vessel had been overhauled in 2001 and again in 2006			0
the vessel was n't licensed to carry passengers out to sea , which allowed operators to avoid requirements reserved for higher classified ships -- including a sometimes expensive , time - consuming @entity100 hull inspection every two years			0
the ship 's classification also allowed it to hire less experienced crew to serve in officer positions			1
the @entity100 and the @entity101 are expected to issue final reports on their investigation as soon as the end of the year			0
