@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the canon of political cliches , " it all comes down to turnout " is among the most tired			0
but in the case of the polarizing and closely watched @entity1 recall election , the maxim happens to ring true			2
public polling , internal polling and campaign strategists all tell the same story : @entity15 gov. @entity15 is clinging to a tiny lead over his @entity18 opponent , @entity19 mayor @entity17 , heading into tuesday 's vote			1
and the number of undecided voters has dwindled to almost zero , strategists in both parties say , meaning that the only mission left for both sides is to get their rabid supporters to the polls			2
" our sole focus right now is on our grassroots get - out - the - vote - effort , " said @entity29 , a spokesman for the @entity31			0
the final blitz began over the weekend			0
" we are @entity1 , " an umbrella group funded by labor unions and the @entity38 , said it contacted nearly 750,000 voters over the weekend , with the goal of touching 1.4 million people with phone calls or door knocks by the close of polls tuesday			1
meanwhile , the state @entity47 and the @entity48 , which are coordinating some of their efforts with the @entity15 campaign , boasted monday that they have identified and contacted 4 million voters since january -- a number that has national @entity47 speculating that they can put the state in play for @entity56 in november			1
the recall fight has its roots in @entity15 's successful push in early 2011 to strip public employees of their collective bargaining rights in an effort to close an ugly budget shortfall			1
the push sparked a bitter partisan battle between @entity15 and @entity18 in the state legislature , and set off a wave of historic protests from union members inside and outside the state capitol in @entity0			1
after @entity15 signed the controversial budget bill in march 2011 , labor organizers subsequently managed to collect 900,000 certified signatures to trigger a recall and are now among those leading the final get - out - the - vote push			1
on monday , at a @entity0 - area branch of the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , @entity17 supporters spent the day popping in to pick up fliers for door - to - door voter contact efforts			2
the union is also paying for cab rides to the polls on tuesday			0
@entity86 , a retiree from @entity87 , was among those who dropped by the @entity80 office to help			0
he said @entity15 deserves to be removed from office because he trampled on @entity1 's cherished tradition of fair play in state government			2
" this is a friendly state , " @entity86 said			0
" people get along here , and i think in our government , that has meant we elect people who work across the aisle and listen to other side			0
and that has just been absent with this current administration			0
it 's ' my way or the highway , ' which is simply not a @entity1 value			0
it 's not how we govern ourselves			0
" @entity15 argues that his reforms are working , pointing to a projected budget surplus and a modest uptick in jobs since he took office last year			1
@entity18 have tried to poke holes in those numbers , but according to recent poll from @entity119 , a slight majority of voters approve of @entity15 's performance in @entity0			1
the @entity123 , @entity17 's hometown paper , also came to @entity15 's defense with a helpful messaging point last week , writing in an editorial that the governor deserves to finish his term			1
@entity15 is not the only @entity47 facing a recall tuesday			1
lt. gov. @entity130 is on the ballot against @entity133 @entity132 , a @entity134 firefighter dubbed " @entity137 " by some of his supporters			1
the undercard also features four of the @entity47 state senators who helped @entity15 pass his budget reforms			1
just one @entity47 loss in those recall races would flip control of the state @entity146 back to @entity18 , at least until the next election in november			1
but the marquee race is between @entity15 and @entity17 , a rematch of the 2010 governor 's race			1
in that historically @entity47 year , @entity15 edged @entity17 in their original matchup by 5 points			1
different dynamics are at work on tuesday , though , giving @entity18 some hope even though @entity15 is considered the narrow favorite			1
while the @entity161 fervor may have waned since protests consumed the state capitol grounds in early 2011 , insiders here predict that turnout on both sides is likely to be higher than it was for the original @entity168 race			0
but even in the race 's eleventh hour , strategists in both parties are struggling to figure out whether turnout will be closer to 2008 levels , when nearly 70 % of eligible @entity1 voters participated in the presidential election , or 2010 , when voter turnout dropped to 49 %			0
@entity18 are hoping for the 2008 model			2
almost 3 million people voted in that election , and the state went heavily for @entity182			0
" it was a low turnout in 2010 and a high turnout in 2008 , " said former @entity1 sen. @entity183 , who spent monday traveling the state rallying @entity18			2
" if we get anywhere near 2008 or even halfway there , we are going to win , because those folks are more likely to vote for @entity17			2
" but unlike 2008 , when @entity47 turnout underwhelmed , @entity1 voters on both sides are now engaged at a level not seen in recent memory			1
" we have an example of @entity197 and @entity198 going on in this state like we have never seen , " said @entity195 , a @entity19 - based @entity47 strategist			1
" people are hyper - engaged , as much in support for their own candidate as in disgust for the opponent			0
" handmade signs are nearly as prevalent as official ones			0
some locals say they have resorted to lowering their voices in public when discussing the recall to avoid setting off arguments with strangers			2
the @entity119 poll revealed that 26 % of all voters have slapped a bumper sticker on their car or planted a sign in their lawn			0
the same survey found that a third of voters have simply stopped talking politics with someone they know because the race is so heated			0
and this is all in a state with a historical reputation for collegiality and @entity231 politeness			0
a flood of campaign money , much of it from out - of - state interest groups and most of it benefiting @entity47 , is partially responsible for the hothouse political climate			2
about $ 64 million has been spent on the race since november 2011 , an analysis from the @entity239 found			0
that 's a new state record , shattering the previous record of $ 37.4 million spent during the 2010 governor 's race			0
beginning last fall , @entity15 seized on a loophole in @entity1 law that allows incumbents in recall elections to raise unlimited sums			2
@entity15 outraised his opponent by an almost 8 - 1 margin , collecting $ 30.5 million to @entity17 's $ 4 million			1
roughly two - thirds of @entity15 's contributions came from out of state , the @entity239 reported , while only a quarter of @entity17 's funds originated from outside @entity1			1
beyond the individual campaigns , independent groups have played a major role in the race , helping saturate television and radio airwaves with negative advertising			0
the @entity266 , for instance , has spent more than $ 8 million on @entity15 's behalf , most it on television ads. working against @entity15 are unions like @entity80 , the @entity270 , the @entity271 and the @entity272 , which have also steered millions of dollars to the state in their efforts to unseat the governor .			2

@entity18 groups say they contacted nearly 750,000 voters over the weekend
@entity47 have contacted 4 million voters this year
the recall fight stems from a battle over collective bargaining rights for public employees
@entity47 gov. @entity15 faces off against @entity133 @entity17 , mayor of @entity19
