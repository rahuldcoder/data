@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity4 struggle to retain control of the @entity6 and retake control of the @entity8 , they are searching for issues to frame their campaigns			1
this is not easy , since the @entity4 are in a difficult position			1
with president @entity15 's low approval ratings , @entity4 candidates wo n't want to focus on his record			1
with the economy likely to still be in laggard condition , @entity4 wo n't be able to boast that it 's morning in @entity20			1
with economic concerns front and center for most @entity20 , @entity4 wo n't be able to make much headway with talk about the foreign policy successes of this administration			1
a number of retirements , including that of @entity31 rep. @entity30 , have made the campaign even more challenging for the party			0
this does n't leave candidates with many options			0
although some could focus on local issues , they will be under pressure to develop a national theme since @entity42 candidates will be talking critically about @entity15			1
so what might @entity4 talk about ? the most potent theme that the party has to offer is the issue of fairness			1
democrats can claim that as @entity20 struggle to survive in this economy , the party has championed policies that aim to soften the blows voters are suffering and to provide support for the middle class in hard times			1
this is a familiar strategy for the @entity4			1
during the 1930s , according to the historian @entity57 , the @entity4 fought for a vision of moral capitalism whereby government and other institutions , such as unions , would lessen some of the suffering that could be inflicted in the free - market economy			1
during his acceptance speech at the 1936 @entity4 convention , president @entity66 said , " today we stand committed to the proposition that freedom is no half - and - half affair			1
if the average citizen is guaranteed equal opportunity in the polling place , he must have equal opportunity in the market place			0
these economic royalists ( his opponents on @entity80 and in the business community ) complain that we seek to overthrow the institutions of @entity20			0
what they really complain of is that we seek to take away their power			0
" fast forward to the 1982 midterm elections , when @entity4 expanded the size of their majority in the @entity8 by 26 seats			1
the economy was suffering from a horrible recession			0
@entity42 , who controlled the @entity8 and @entity6 , took the blame			2
@entity4 spent their campaigns talking about fairness and the unwillingness of president @entity97 to support policies that did not privilege upper - income taxpayers and corporations			1
while @entity97 spoke about the virtues of supply - side economics , house speaker @entity101 held hearings to bring attention to this issue			0
rep. @entity107 said , " every @entity20 who cares about other @entity20 , who cares about civil rights and equal opportunity , who cares about clean air and clean water , who cares about poor people and old people and helpless people , ought to care about the 1982 @entity8 elections			0
" he warned that " these wolves in wolves ' clothing -- ultra-conservative ideologues , religious fanatics , corporate fat cats , reborn @entity126 , the single - issue zealots -- are shoving traditional @entity42 out the back door of their own party			2
" the 2012 election is obviously much different from any in the 1930s or 1982			0
nonetheless there are three issues through which @entity4 have an opportunity to build on this theme			1
@entity42 have pushed for @entity138 to extend president @entity140 's tax cuts for the wealthiest @entity20			2
even though taking this step would only aggravate the deficit problem , the @entity42 has stood firm			2
at the same time , congressional republicans have made it difficult to extend the payroll tax holiday that has benefited lower and middle income workers			0
many @entity6 @entity42 rebuffed their own leadership by voting against extending the cut			2
other republicans are bending , but slowly and after a lot of complaint			0
the optics could work against them			0
these tax positions create room for @entity4 to challenge republicans as being more supportive of helping the wealthy than average @entity20			2
the accusations have already started			0
" @entity166 is ready to raise taxes on middle - class families already struggling to get back on their feet in order to protect millionaires and billionaires , " said @entity159 , the @entity160 chairman , in a comment about the senator , who is facing a challenge from @entity165 professor @entity164			1
the second issue has been unemployment insurance			1
throughout the past four years , @entity42 have presented roadblocks to the extension of these benefits even as @entity20 have struggled with extraordinarily difficult economic challenges			2
@entity42 have grudgingly accepted these extensions in exchange for other sorts of measures			1
while many @entity20 do n't like government , many understand and support the need for temporary assistance as people try to make ends meet			0
this is an area where @entity4 can talk about a specific policy and win support for spending from an electorate that might be philosophically opposed to big government			2
finally there is health care , an issue that is likely to be part of the campaign if the @entity201 issues a ruling on the constitutionality of the law before the election			0
the debate over health care has ranged around a number of issues including the mandate and health care exchanges			0
but one of the biggest contributions of the program is to extend health insurance to over 30 million @entity20 who do n't have it			0
fairness is the theme that offers a struggling @entity4 the best opportunity to improve its standing in @entity138			1
some democrats have already begun to outline the message			0
according to @entity224 , @entity223 sen. @entity222 explained that " simply attacking the wealthy is a bad idea			0
saying the wealthy have to do their fair share is the right idea			0
" unless economic conditions change dramatically , @entity4 congressional candidates will be in a precarious position , even with the unhappiness about the @entity42			1
republicans at least have @entity15 as a straw man around which to build their campaigns			0
@entity4 need their own theme			1
focusing on @entity42 obstruction is one alternative , but more appealing might be a message and vision for dealing with the sluggish economic recovery in the coming years			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			2

@entity245 says @entity4 need a national theme for their 2012 campaigns
he says they should stress fairness and push measures to help poor , middle class
he says @entity42 , by its stance on taxes and unemployment insurance , may *alienate* voters
