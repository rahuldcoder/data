-- a visit to the whirlpool tub cool - down zone signals the endgame for sunday 's @entity5 competitors			1
but for the furry beasts of the annual @entity7 , a jump in the water pit means the competition for cuteness has only just begun			1
prime time is playtime for the scamps who have provided alternative programming to @entity18 's biggest sports viewing experience for nine years			2
according to @entity20 , the 12 - hour @entity7 marathon drew 8.7 million viewers last year			1
the broadcast 's overload of adorable has included " cheerleaders " of various species ; hamsters " flying " in the blimp over the @entity7 stadium ; meep the bird , who , naturally , tweets from the sidelines ( he got 21,000 followers on @entity36 during last year 's @entity7 ) ; and even a hairless @entity31 " streaker " puppy			1
you can thank executive producer @entity40 , who joined @entity20 in 2001 , for upping the cute factor with many of the above innovations			1
" there 's some sort of inherent , unspoken joy in seeing these little fluffy things being who they are , " @entity40 said			2
" looking into a puppy 's face ... there 's something mesmerizing and calming			2
it just sort of soothes the soul			0
" this year 's bowl will include new features like a slow - mo cute cam , snout - to - lens shots and lipstick cameras in the toys to get new points of view , she said			1
the puppies will also have the new watery cool - down zone			1
it 's a setup that expands on the water bowl camera , with more splashing and even slow - motion shots of the puppies shaking off water			1
referee @entity72 is back sunday for a second year of calling " personal fouls " and " unnecessary cuteness " penalties on the furry players			0
the " rules " of the game are pretty loose			0
mostly the puppies amble around a large playpen that looks like a football field , pouncing on squeaky toys or tugging on rope			1
there is never a clear winner in the @entity7			1
still , viewers might choose one kind of puppy to root for , or even one particular player , @entity40 said			1
" you root for them to be the mvp -- the @entity93 -- of the show , " she said			2
the cast of fuzzy beasties , all between 8 and 12 weeks old , comes from shelters across the country , @entity40 said			2
some have even come from @entity100			0
all the puppies , kittens , hamsters and meep the bird are adoptable			2
@entity20 normally films the frolicking in october in order to edit the show by @entity109 , so many of the animals are already adopted by airtime			1
" we have a pretty incredible track record , " helping @entity114 find adopters for the puppies , @entity40 said			2
" for this year , all but four have already been adopted			0
" a representative from the @entity118 is present during filming to make sure the animals are safe			0
breaks for water and cuddling are mandatory , and puppies are never on camera for more than 20 minutes at a time			0
the casting of @entity7 is all about the cuteness factor			2
" these are desirable puppies , " @entity40 said			0
" they 're camera ready ! " the cheerleaders , too , go through a casting process			0
last year , piglet cheerleaders hammed it up during the show			0
this year , the cheerleaders are hedgehogs			0
@entity40 points out that if you want to adopt a hedgehog you 'd better check with your state , because these unusual pets are not legal to own in all parts of the country			0
back in the @entity7 studio , it 's a pet - lover 's dream come true			1
" our staff ca n't keep their hands off our players , " @entity40 said			0
she personally dognaps one of the puppies during filming and brings it into the control room			0
she confessed to being partial to " superfluffy " shih tzus			0
who will you root for on @entity7 sunday ? choose your favorite competitor from the gallery above .			1

12 hours of frolicking puppies is @entity20 's @entity5 *counter-programming*
slow - mo cute cams and cameras stuck in squeaky toys aim to capture the cute
instead of rooting for a @entity7 team , viewers can root for an mvp
