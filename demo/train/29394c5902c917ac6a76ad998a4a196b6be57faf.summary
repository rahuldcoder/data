-- what do @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 have in common besides being public figures ? they all suffered from stuttering at some point in their lives			1
but what is stuttering and how it does it manifest itself ? the @entity15 explains on its website that it is " a communication disorder in which the flow of speech is broken by repetitions , prolongations , or abnormal stoppages of sounds and syllables			2
" in february 2010 , a group of researchers published a study in the @entity29 , which states that the brain cells of people who stutter have three genetic mutations ; this causes problems in the cells ' metabolism			0
" this process is called the garbage can , or more like the recycling bin , of the cell			0
when this process gets interrupted , the cell goes haywire , and that causes problems , " the study 's co-author @entity40 told @entity0			2
according to the @entity46 , 1 % of the world 's population , around 68 million people , stutter			2
one of them is @entity52 , a @entity53 golfer who has been professional for 18 years , winning 28 titles on the most prestigious tours and earning over $ 6.3 million , proving that stuttering is not an impediment to succeed			1
during september 's @entity59 , a biennial international match played between a @entity60 and a @entity62 team , @entity52 wrote on her official blog : " i decided to leave my comfort zone and give my first tv interview			1
" @entity52 decided to speak to the @entity66			1
the editing team worked for two hours on the 70 minutes it took her to answer nine questions			2
the result ? a three - and - a - half - minute interview			1
the 37 - year - old told @entity74 : " with help from people with good hearts and a little patience maybe a stutterers story can get out there			1
" i 've always had it , ever since i first started speaking			0
both my older brothers had it too , but by the time they started school it disappeared			0
unfortunately i was n't that lucky			0
" nonetheless , she had unconditional support from four boys who attended the same school as her , a quartet @entity52 describes as " the cool kids			1
" she also explained how sports were key to her development			0
" i was very good at all sports growing up and i think that played a huge part			2
i always played with the boys and i was always the first one to get picked for any team			2
" in first grade she began speech therapy in the school 's facilities , but far from helping it increased her feelings of isolation			2
" it just made me feel singled out and enlighten my problem , that i did n't really see as being much of a problem , " @entity52 said			1
" we really did n't do much ; we played different games , probably some that made me say or repeat different words			0
" eventually @entity52 left therapy , spending her high school years focusing on her game			1
she was not the best amateur and could only make it into the ' b ' team , but the real challenge came when she had to make new friends			2
" because of my stutter i tend to go where it 's safe and people know me , i do n't venture out and try to meet new people unless it 's forced upon me. , " she said			0
@entity52 decided to give speech therapy another shot , commiting to twice - weekly sessions with her therapist for six months			1
" she was really good and i think it helped me , " she reflected			0
" but it 's too hard for me to translate what i learned into real life			1
" @entity52 could n't leave stuttering behind , but she clung to golf , and in 1994 the @entity53 got her @entity140 ( @entity140 ) membership			1
this new professional opportunity forced her to once again meet new people , so she sought help from her family			0
" i had my brother out with me the first summer so he kind of got me going , " she recalled			0
" he is a very social and all around great guy so i just tagged along with him ... i had my dad helping me with flights , booking them over the phone			0
" by 1998 , @entity52 had won three times on the let and received the @entity152 award once			1
it was time to join the world 's largest and most dominant women 's tour , the @entity154 ( @entity154 )			0
three @entity154 titles and four years later , she decided to try another treatment at the @entity158 in @entity159 , founded in 1972 to investigate stuttering with scientific methods and new treatment approaches			0
" that was a three - week intensive course which was very good , but again , back in real life , i had a very difficult time using what i learned			1
" none of the treatments she tried in different stages of her life worked			0
so when she won the @entity170 , she asked someone else do gave the winner 's speech for her			1
" i would 've loved to have made the thank you speech instead of having @entity176 do it for me , but because of my stuttering it would 've been monday by the time i finished , " she wrote in a @entity180 article			0
@entity52 's impediment is severe , but she still feels fortunate to have achieved all she has within golf			1
" the best thing is to have been lucky enough to go where i 've gone , " @entity52 said			1
" it 's important not to care what people think and just do what you want to do			0
if they have a problem with that , that is exactly that , their problem			0
