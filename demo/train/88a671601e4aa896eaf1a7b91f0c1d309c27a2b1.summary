@entity0 -- domestic dispute or terror thriller ? @entity5 's story can not be both , and now it may be left to the @entity6 to sort out the dramatic and often confounding facts of this convicted federal felon 's appeal			1
put simply , we 'll call it " the case of the @entity13			2
" at issue is whether @entity15 may criminalize conduct -- under its treaty ratification power -- that is properly the domain of the states			2
@entity5 was given a longer prison sentence in the federal system after being convicted of violating an international agreement on the use of chemical weapons			1
oral arguments in the case will be heard by the justices tuesday morning			2
this case of toxic love has soap - opera elements , but @entity5 's lawyers argued she was being treated like an international terrorist or a rogue state engaged in chemical warfare instead of someone caught up on the wrong end of a love triangle			1
they say she should have been tried in the state system , where @entity5 may have faced a simple assault charge and just a year behind bars			1
the implications go far beyond this case , and could establish important precedents on the strength and purpose of the @entity49 's 10th amendment , which limits federal authority			1
it is also an issue roiling the current political debate , especially among tea party conservatives in this post- 9/11 , security - conscious environment			0
the appeal barely made a ripple in local media and had been all but ignored until the high court first heard the issue two years ago			0
now the sequel promises to answer larger questions of the limits on @entity0 's power			2
@entity5 , a native of @entity65 , lived outside @entity66 and worked as a microbiologist			2
as a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case : " @entity5 was excited when her closest friend , @entity71 , announced she was pregnant			1
@entity5 's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband , @entity74 , was the child 's father			1
" the woman -- known to her family as @entity79 -- struck back by putting her science training to ill use			2
the 42 - year - old stole a dangerous chemical -- arsenic - based 10 - chloro - @entity84 - phenoxarsine , to be exact -- from her company , and obtained potassium dichromate over the @entity87			2
both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic , even lethal harm with very little physical contact			0
she then tried to poison @entity94 some two dozen times over several months , secretly sprinkling the chemicals on an apartment doorknob , car door handles , and a mailbox			0
while she suffered no more than a chemical burn on her thumb , @entity94 noticed something was amiss -- one of the chemicals is a bright orange powder -- and called local police in @entity106 , @entity107 , who merely suggested she wipe her car and doors regularly			2
unhappy with that response , @entity94 contacted her local mail carrier , and federal postal inspectors quickly jumped into the mystery			0
surveillance cameras were set up and sure enough , @entity5 was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and car muffler , court records show			2
professor accused of poisoning wife her lawyer said @entity5 admitted her guilt early on in what they considered a case of a woman emotionally traumatized by the betrayal of two people once very close to her			1
" i did n't think that the federal government had any role to be in this case and i tried to convince them not to bring the case or just dismiss the charges , " @entity133 , @entity5 's defense attorney , told @entity1			1
" and i promised them in writing that we would go over to county court and plead and let her do her jail time in county court			0
i tried to convince them that by misapplying the law they could jeopardize the statute even surviving the case			0
but they decided to go ahead and bring these charges			0
" @entity5 claimed she never meant to kill @entity94 , but only wanted to cause her " an uncomfortable rash			2
" the defendant also said her friend 's betrayal caused an " emotional breakdown " that made her act in such a shocking fashion			0
" the statute itself is so broad as ... to be meaningless , " @entity133 said			0
" it prohibits the use of any chemical weapon			1
and what 's a chemical weapon ? it 's any object , any item that has toxic chemicals			1
if in the case of an angry spouse throwing a can of @entity173 " -- a bleach - based cleaner -- " at his wife , or vice versa , that would be considered to be use of a chemical weapon and the terrorism statute would apply			1
i ca n't imagine that the people that were involved in the treaty would anticipate such a broad application			2
" when a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court , @entity5 pleaded guilty and immediately appealed			1
she received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $ 12,000 in fines and restitution			0
an appeals court ultimately rejected her claims , citing a 1920 @entity6 precedent giving @entity15 the power to enact treaties , even if it steps outside its traditional constitutional authority by usurping state laws			0
before she could take the challenge to the @entity202 @entity6 , she needed a ruling that she had " standing , " or authority , to press her larger constitutional claims			0
the high court recognized that standing in a unanimous 2011 decision			0
she now gets her second date before the court and perhaps a final resolution			0
the @entity213 administration still believes @entity5 's federal conviction was valid			1
" the @entity49 does not prohibit federal prosecution in an area of overlapping federal and state authority , " the @entity215 said in its brief to the high court , rejecting @entity5 's assertion the treaty makes an exception for chemicals used for " peaceful " purposes that are not " warlike " in nature			1
" no reasonable construction of that phrase would cover petitioner 's conduct			0
petitioner 's deployment of highly toxic chemicals with the intent of harming @entity94 can hardly be characterized as ' peaceful ' under that word 's commonly understood meaning			0
" the government says federal law broadly prohibits a person from knowingly using a chemical weapon in a way that can " cause death , temporary incapacitation , or permanent harm " to another person -- exactly what @entity5 did here			1
did @entity249 doctor kill his wife ? some see hope the right - leaning majority on the bench might use the opportunity to delve further into @entity255 of this legal drama -- the scope of the 10th amendment , which states , " the powers not delegated to the @entity202 by the @entity49 , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people			0
" in the broader political context , conservatives , along with a healthy mix of liberals and libertarians , worry that the federal government and @entity15 have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states , especially in the criminal arena			1
many scholars and activists argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh , creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety			0
they see @entity5 as an unexpected hero in that fight to return " the power back to the people			1
" " there 's a concern that a number of people have , really across the political spectrum , that we have over-federalized crime , that it is too easy for @entity15 to pass a new law , " said @entity287 , @entity5 's appellate attorney who was @entity202 solicitor general under president @entity288			1
" there is some outrage in @entity202 when politicians pass a law to create a new federal offense , without people stopping and thinking whether that 's something that local law enforcement can deal with			2
" and it is not just felonies			0
areas like gun ownership , zoning laws , environmental regulation , taxation , health care , and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of a high court decision			0
" you now have a road map -- if you find the limitations on the federal government 's authority irksome , any president has a simple path to get around it			1
find any nation in the world , negotiate a treaty agreeing to do what you could n't do otherwise , and if the @entity332 ratifies it ... then suddenly the federal government has authority it did n't have before , " said sen. @entity323 , @entity324 , last week			1
" the proposition that the @entity334 is a trump card that defeats all of the remaining structural limitations on the federal government is not a proposition that is logically defensible			1
" as for @entity5 , the current legal fight will not provide her much practical benefit			2
she was released from a federal prison in @entity341 14 months ago , so a second high court victory may only be symbolic			0
she has not talked publicly about her case , but her trial lawyer says the husband is supporting @entity5 in the appeals			1
when last we checked , the couple was trying to overcome his infidelity and had been working to rebuild their shaky marriage			0
she had allowed him to visit her while she was incarcerated			0
the case is @entity5 v. @entity202 ( 12 - 158 )			1
a ruling is expected by the spring .			0

@entity5 is challenging her conviction on a federal chemical weapon charge
she used poisons to try to get back at a woman who had an affair with @entity5 's husband
attorney : " i did n't think that the federal government had any role to be in this case "
@entity215 says @entity5 's action falls under an international chemical weapon treaty
