after the touchline incident , @entity8 proceeded to take the lead through @entity41 's first - half penalty after he was fouled by @entity42			1

these conditions make a game of emotions			0
@entity1 was asked if he regretted the incident			2

" b was @entity20 , to see how badly he was injured , " he claimed			0
earlier , @entity97 moved up to fourth with a 2 - 1 win over @entity99 at @entity100 , but owed a lot to the goalkeeping heroics of @entity103 , who saved a first half penalty from @entity105			2
@entity97 were already ahead through @entity106 , but the visitors pulled level when @entity109 scored in the 55th minute			0
@entity111 star @entity110 put @entity113 's men ahead just after the hour with his first goal in @entity26 football before @entity103 denied @entity116 with a stunning save to preserve three points for his side			0
@entity119 is up to sixth , level on points with @entity97 and @entity122 , after a 1 - 0 win over their manager @entity124 's former side @entity127			0
@entity128 scored the only goal of the match at @entity131 in the first half			0
ahead of the international break , @entity134 heavyweights @entity133 and @entity135 played out a pulsating five - goal thriller in @entity138			1
both sides had won its opening five games in @entity142 , but champion @entity133 came out on top 3 - 2 thanks to a volleyed late winner from @entity146 in the 86th minute			1
the first half saw a series questionable penalties for either side , the first two converted by @entity150 for @entity133 and @entity151 for the visitors			2
@entity135 coach @entity153 was sent to the stands for arguing the first penalty , but he would have been pleased to see @entity156 put his side ahead on a breakaway in the 43rd minute			0
@entity133 almost immediately drew level in first half injury time with another disputed penalty , put away by @entity150			0
the match looked headed for a draw until defender @entity146 proved an unlikely match winner , but there was still time for @entity166 to clash with @entity135 defender @entity167 and both were red - carded			1
@entity170 champions @entity169 also scored a key victory sunday , thumping @entity172 5 - 0 in the @entity173 , with @entity174 scoring a hat - trick and @entity176 adding a double			1
