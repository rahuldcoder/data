@entity0 , @entity1 -- shortly after joining the @entity4 in 2007 , @entity3 was dispatched to the home of two elderly women			1
what he saw left him appalled			2
the two women -- a mother in her 90s and a daughter in her 70s -- had no food and no electricity			2
each month , they alternated what they spent their small amount of money on : one month it would be medicine , the next it would be food and bills			0
" they were struggling horrifically , " @entity3 recalled			1
" they had to cut their medications			0
they were doing the things that seniors often do to try to make up the financial difference			2
" in his 10 years as a @entity1 police officer , @entity3 had witnessed countless senior citizens in tragic circumstances			1
but this was the last straw for him			0
" i 'd had enough , " he said			0
" and i realized that something had to be done			0
and that 's when i started to conceptualize the @entity36			0
" since 2009 , @entity3 's group has tended to the basic needs of nearly 1,000 seniors in @entity40 , @entity1			1
with the help of hundreds of local volunteers , seniors are provided with essential assistance such as food , money , transportation , vehicle maintenance and help around the house			1
" if you 're 80 years old and you have to get up on a footstool to change your light bulb and you fall , it could kill you , " said @entity3 , 40			1
" when it 's 100 degrees outside and you 're faced with either doing your yard or being fined , and you ca n't pay somebody to do it , what do you do ? well , you get out there and do it and suck it up , right ? " but sucking it up killed this ( one ) gentleman			1
a very kind elderly man walked outside to do his yard , and he did n't survive			2
and that 's happening all the time			0
" @entity3 said seniors facing diminished income in a difficult economy often have to make life - and - death choices for where and how to spend their money			1
for example , a light bulb that illuminates a doorway -- or a repair to a front door -- might easily fall below food and medicine on a senior 's list of priorities and make them more vulnerable to crime			1
if a licensed worker is out of a senior 's financial reach , they might be willing to pay cash to a stranger who knocks on their door offering to clean their yard or perform basic services			1
too often , @entity3 says , these strangers are not who they say they are			1
" as cops and firefighters , we see people at their worst			0
that 's just the way it is , " @entity3 said			1
" and when you see seniors on a regular basis ... and they 're constantly being scammed or victimized ... you start to ask yourself : ' why ? what can we do ? i 'm tired of walking away from this elderly person 's house every day and not being able to fix the problem			1
' ... " if you have a crime , then ( police ) can handle it			2
if you have a fire , the fire department can handle it			2
but what do you do when somebody ca n't pay their electric bill and , as a result , that wo n't run their oxygen pump ? how do you deal with that ? " forming the @entity36 was a natural offshoot of @entity3 's job as community relations officer for his department			1
the group became a nonprofit in early 2010 , and it expanded to include the entire county this year			2
by partnering with faith - based organizations , local businesses and other nonprofits , the group can call upon hundreds of volunteers to make house calls			1
seniors are either referred by local first responders or reach out for help directly			1
assistance could be as minor as retrieving a pill that has fallen behind a piece of heavy furniture or as major as rebuilding a senior 's home			2
all of the group 's services are free and covered by private donations			2
about once every month , the group schedules a large " operation " in which dozens of volunteers descend upon a local neighborhood to do massive group service , such as yard cleanup or a sweeping installation of energy - efficient lighting			1
@entity3 says this is often a great way to identify individuals who need more help			1
" that operation ... always leads to finding other things , whether it 's floor issues , window issues , ( air conditioning ) issues , whatever the case might be , " he said			0
" it 's a neat opportunity for us to get on the ground , take a good look around and see how else we can help			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity181 @entity3 's dedication to public safety might not be unique among police officers , but his compassion for seniors is rooted in a more intimate history			1
he was raised primarily by his grandparents and great - grandmother in a senior community			2
" elderly people rescued me in a lot of ways , " he said			0
" they taught me respect			0
they taught me so many things			0
and this is simply an opportunity for me to give back to them in their time of need , because that time is here and it 's now			0
" and it 's something that is only going to get worse over the next 20 years , according to the @entity205			0
each day in the @entity206 , about 10,000 @entity206 turn 65			0
by 2030 , when all baby boomers will have passed the milestone , 18 % of the nation 's population will be at least that age , @entity205 projects			0
" we need more organizations , more businesses , more churches , more police departments , more fire departments to get on board , see the big picture , see the problem , " said @entity3 , who hopes to see his nonprofit model replicated nationwide			1
" this is just the beginning			0
" for seniors like @entity227 , the group 's efforts have been life - changing			1
the @entity229 veteran had worn a hole in his bathroom floor with his wheelchair , leaving him vulnerable to an accident			2
it was also difficult for @entity227 to leave his home , so he had to often rely on other people to walk his dogs			0
but he was introduced to @entity3 's group last month , and volunteers have since replaced and tiled his bathroom floor , fixed his leaky kitchen faucet and installed a wheelchair ramp at the front entrance of his home			1
" it means the difference between feeling like i 'm a burden on someone and being able to do something for myself , " @entity227 said			0
" since they 're putting this little ramp ( in ) , i can take the dogs out to walk them			0
i do n't have to wait for someone to come help me			2
" @entity3 says that helping @entity227 and other seniors is a pleasure and a privilege			1
" ( this ) is an opportunity for me to embrace the very people that embraced me growing up			0
... this is my chance to take care of them as they have taken care of me			0

police officer @entity3 often saw senior citizens vulnerable and victimized

the house calls provide specialized service that police , fire departments usually ca n't
