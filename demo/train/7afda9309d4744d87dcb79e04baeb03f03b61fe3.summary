-- " @entity2 " movie may not have had trouble earning a @entity5 rating , but many parents and educators are wondering whether the best - selling book trilogy belongs on library shelves			1
the @entity11 's @entity10 released its annual list of most frequently challenged books of 2011 yesterday , and the increased popularity of @entity16 ' dystopian saga -- in large part fueled by buzz surrounding the blockbuster film -- drove the books higher on the list			1
in 2010 , only the first novel cracked the top ten at number five			2
in 2011 , all three books occupy the number three position , and the complaints have grown more varied : " anti-ethnic ; anti-family ; insensitivity ; offensive language ; occult / satanic ; violence			1
" the @entity11 keeps track of challenges filed and counted 327 reported attempts to restrict or remove books from schools and libraries in 2011			1
the association defines a challenge as " a formal , written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that a book or other material be restricted or removed because of its content or appropriateness			0
" @entity47 , director of the @entity11 's @entity10 , told the @entity48 that many of the complaints leveled against " @entity2 " books focused on the film version directed by @entity53			1
" there was complaining about the choice of actors for the film , " she said			0
" you had people saying someone was dark - skinned in the book , but not in the film , or dark - skinned in the film and not in the book			0
in general , a lot more people were aware of the books and that led to more kinds of complaints			2
" @entity71 , a regular on these types of lists , came in at number one with her epistolary internet girl books			2
but the book that topped the list last year -- " @entity81 , " about two male penguins who raise a baby chick together -- did n't crack the top ten			0
@entity83 said she 'd like to believe that people are becoming more tolerant of homosexuality , but it may just be that other books are attracting more attention			0
what do you think about the complaints against " @entity2 " books ? " @entity95 , " i get , but can you see why anyone would call them " anti-family " or " anti-ethnic " ? see the full article at @entity0			1
