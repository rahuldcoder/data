-- a court in @entity3 has granted an 8 - year - old girl a divorce from her 47 - year - old husband , after twice denying the divorce request previously , local media reported thursday			1
the marriage sparked condemnations around the world from human rights groups and @entity12 and other government officials when it first came to light in december			2
local media , which is highly regulated by the @entity3 government , reported that the court in the city of @entity18 approved the divorce decree thursday , and the divorce is final			1
a source at the court told the @entity3 daily newspaper @entity22 that the divorce " came after a series of pleas made by a number of officials in the region to the husband			1
" @entity0 efforts to reach court officials , the husband and the girl 's father have been unsuccessful			0
according to the attorney for the young girl 's mother , the father of the girl had arranged the marriage between his daughter and a close friend of his to settle his debts with the man			1
when the mother went to court to try to get the marriage annulled , @entity3 judge @entity44 rejected the request on a legal technicality			1
the judge ruled that the mother -- who is separated from the girl 's father -- was not the child 's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court , according to the mother 's lawyer , @entity56			2
however , the judge required the girl 's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty , @entity56 said			0
the lawyer said in the original marriage agreement , the father of the girl stipulated that the marriage would not be consummated until she was 18			2
the judge also ruled that the girl could file a petition for a divorce when she reached puberty , @entity56 said			0
the young girl lives with her mother , the attorney said , and was never told that she was married			0
when the initial petition to annul the marriage was rejected , the mother appealed the verdict to an appeals court in the @entity3 capital of @entity82			1
the appeals court declined to certify the original ruling , in essence rejecting @entity44 's verdict , and sent the case back to him for reconsideration			0
under the complicated @entity3 legal process , the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect but that a challenge to the marriage was ongoing			1
earlier this month , the original judge refused for a second time to annul the marriage			0
soon after that decision , @entity3 's justice minister told @entity22 that he planned to enact a law that will protect young girls from such marriages			1
the law will place restrictions on the practice to preserve the rights of children and prevent abuses , justice minister @entity104 was quoted as saying			1
additionally , @entity111 said there would be a study of a system that will include regulations for the marriage of minors and everything related to such unions , the newspaper reported			0
no details on the restrictions or regulations were mentioned			0
the minister did not say whether child marriage would be abolished			1
responding to the justice minister 's comments and the possibility of a new child marriage law , @entity56 told @entity0 at the time , " this is what we requested from day one , and we know that @entity3 officials are working so hard on resolving this issue			1
" @entity132 believes that such a law would help not only his defendant but many other @entity3 minors facing a similar problem			2
in @entity139 monday , under secretary of state for political affairs @entity137 called the marriage a human rights abuse			0
" child marriage is , unfortunately , still common in much of @entity3 and we have voiced our concern about this practice at the highest levels , " he told a conference on @entity12 - @entity3 relations			1
" we were encouraged by reports that the @entity149 had begun to review the legal age of marriage			2
" after the divorce was denied for a second time , the head of the @entity153 issued a statement expressing concern about the case			2
@entity153 executive director @entity159 said , " the right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the @entity163			0
consent can not be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision			0
" the issue of child marriage has been a hot - button topic in the deeply conservative @entity3 kingdom recently			1
while rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages , the kingdom 's top cleric has said that it 's ok for girls as young as 10 to wed. " it is incorrect to say that it 's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger , " @entity180 , the kingdom 's grand mufti , said in january , according to the regional @entity183 newspaper			1
" a girl aged 10 or 12 can be married			0
those who think she 's too young are wrong , and they are being unfair to her			0
" @entity180 reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry			0
" we hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls , " he said , according to the newspaper			2
" we should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women			0
" sharia law is @entity207 law , and @entity3 follows a strict interpretation of @entity207 called @entity209 .			2
