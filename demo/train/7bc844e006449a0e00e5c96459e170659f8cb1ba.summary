@entity0 tested what it described as a new type of " cutting - edge " anti-ship missile with its leader @entity5 pictured beaming at the launch , as shown in state media on saturday			1
but some analysts are saying @entity0 's touted missiles appear to be @entity11 designs			1
the announcement of the test also occurs just weeks before the annual joint @entity17 - @entity16 military exercises , that annually draws colorful rhetoric and promises of catastrophe from @entity21			1
the test - firing took place in the @entity24 and the @entity0 media boasted that its " intelligent rocket precisely sought , tracked and hit the ' enemy ' ship after taking a safe flight			2
" the @entity16 defense ministry said five short - range missiles were fired on sunday with a range of 200 kilometers ( 124 miles )			2
the purpose of the new missiles are for @entity0 to defend its waters and " strongly react to any attempt of the enemy 's fleets of warships for military attack , through close combat or distant combat , " according to @entity0 's state - run @entity43 news agency			0
@entity0 media also showed a beaming @entity5 standing with military generals who were applauding			0
it also reported that @entity5 expressed " satisfaction " over the " highest level " of rockets being developed in @entity0			0
but that point is being disputed , as one analytical officer wrote the weapon appeared to be a @entity11 @entity55 anti-ship cruise missile			1
" whether the @entity58 ( @entity59 ) acquired the system directly from @entity11 or a third party is unclear , " wrote @entity56 in the @entity0 analysis site , 38 @entity0			1
" should the new system be successfully integrated into the @entity58 and widely deployed it would represent a significant step towards redressing the service 's obsolescence and increasing the threat poised to @entity16 and @entity69 vessels in the region			0
" @entity56 also cautioned that this was only a " potential development " as @entity0 's military has a " long history of slow and often poor system integration			0
" this year , @entity0 has made the usual protestations of the joint @entity17 - @entity16 military exercises , which it has referred in the past as " joint saber - rattling			1
" it offered a nuclear moratorium earlier this year in exchange for canceling the joint exercises			0
but the @entity17 rejected the proposal , with a @entity85 spokeswoman calling it a " false choice			0
" through @entity43 , @entity0 has since denounced @entity17 with its colorful slogans as : " let 's wipe out and annihilate the enemy and give death to him ! " and warning that the @entity17 " imperialists will face final doom			2
" after the @entity94 , which ended with an armistice in 1953 , the @entity17 has maintained military personnel in @entity16			2
based on a mutual defense treaty , the countries have carried out annual joint military exercises between @entity17 units and @entity16 armed forces , that they say are defensive in nature			1
@entity1 's @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity16 , contributed to this report .			0
