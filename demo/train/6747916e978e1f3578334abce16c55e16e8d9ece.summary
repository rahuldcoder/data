@entity1 the @entity0 cleared its first procedural hurdle in an effort to green - light the @entity5 on monday -- but the project 's advocates will still need a few more votes if they are to overcome president @entity11 's expected veto			1
the @entity0 voted 63 to 32 to take up the bill , which would end the @entity14 's six - year review of the 1,179 - mile @entity16 - to - @entity17 pipeline and authorize its construction			1
@entity19 threatens vetoes on eve of meeting with lawmakers ten democrats and one independent joined all of the chamber 's @entity26 in backing the bill -- suggesting there are enough votes to approve it , a major milestone for a bill that had cleared the @entity19 but stalled in the @entity0 in previous years			1
its passage is a goal for new senate majority leader @entity35 , @entity36 , who has made it the first bill the now @entity26 - controlled chamber has taken up			0
but the pipeline 's supporters will need 67 votes -- a two - thirds majority -- to override an @entity11 veto			1
the president has said he would like the decision left in the hands of the executive branch , rather than handed over to @entity48			0
the push to build the pipeline got a boost friday when the @entity52 ok'ed its route through the state , removing a legal case that the @entity11 administration had said it wanted to see play out before issuing a decision			0
the @entity0 is likely to consider amendments to the bill this week and next week , with a final vote coming sometime around @entity11 's @entity62 speech			1
the @entity5 bill 's sponsor , sen. @entity63 , @entity64 , told " @entity70 " this weekend that he hopes the amendment process will attract more @entity69 supporters to the bill			2
" right now we 've got about 63 [ votes ] , " @entity63 said			0
" but we 're going to the floor with an open amendment process , trying to foster more bipartisanship ... so that we can pass this measure and other measures and either override the veto or attach the bill to other legislation that will get 67 votes			2
" one @entity81 said on the program that he does n't expect that to happen			0
sen. @entity84 of @entity85 said , " it 's clear that there will not be a veto override			0

the @entity0 voted 63 - 32 on monday to advance a bill that authorizes construction of the @entity5 pipeline
that 's not enough votes to override president @entity11 's expected veto of the bill
the @entity0 will consider amendments that supporters hope will attract more democrats in the coming weeks
