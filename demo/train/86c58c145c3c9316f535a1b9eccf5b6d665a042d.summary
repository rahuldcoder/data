-- " ouch ! " is what most of us think when we think of jellyfish			2
they 're slimy and they have no brains			0
so who would 've predicted that the lowly jellyfish could emerge from the shadows as a destroyer of fisheries and ecosystems and even as a threat to penguins and whales			2
far down in @entity18 -- the last pristine wilderness , some might say -- the balance is shifting from krill to jellyfish			1
in this harsh land , just about everything bigger than a krill eats krill : whales , seabirds , fish and penguins			1
but krill are disappearing , thanks to us and the jellyfish			1
we fish out vast amounts of krill for our omega - 3 supplements ; the jellyfish eat vast quantities of plankton , leaving little for the krill to eat			1
all over the world , from the @entity39 to the @entity40 , from the @entity41 to the @entity42 , from @entity43 to the @entity44 , from the @entity45 to the @entity46 to the @entity47 off @entity48 , any place oceans are in trouble , jellyfish are taking over			1
jellyfish do well in warmer waters			1
our carbon dioxide emissions are both warming the water and causing it to become corrosive			1
warmer water -- even a fraction of a degree -- holds less oxygen than cooler water and shifts the balance of who survives and who perishes			1
news : jellyfish taking over ocean , experts warn a strange type of jellyfish - like creature called a salp is particularly taking advantage			1
salps are surely one of the world 's most bizarre critters			2
they can grow 10 % of their body length per hour and go through two generations in a day			0
they are more closely related to humans than to most other types of jellyfish , though they certainly do n't look like it			2
their bodies look like clear , gelatinous barrels			0
salps do n't sting , but they do their damage in their staggering numbers			0
ask the operators of @entity90 nuclear power plant on the coast of central @entity92			0
in april 2012 , @entity93 was plunged into emergency shutdown because of salps clogging up the seawater intake pipes for the cooling system			0
this might seem freakish , but jellyfish have caused many dozens of such shutdowns at nuclear power plants , coal - fired power plants , desalination plants -- pretty much any type of industry that draws seawater			1
even seawater - cooled data centers such as @entity110 's @entity109 facility are at risk			1
different types of jellyfish have caused mass fish kills at salmon farms all over the world			1
@entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 ... you name it			0
if salmon are being farmed , you can bet there are terrible jellyfish problems			2
jellyfish have also taken over @entity128 , one of @entity131 's beautiful fjords and previously one of its best fishing spots			1
there is nary a fish to be found			2
recently , two more fjords have also become colonized by jellyfish as their fisheries have declined			2
the stings and emergency shutdowns are bad -- and let 's face it , that whole slimy thing is a bit off - putting -- but the real problem with jellyfish is in their predator - prey dynamic with fish			1
on the face of it , fish are obviously the superior predator : they are smarter , faster and often bigger			2
think of sharks and stingrays and largemouth bass : it 's hard to imagine that jellyfish could possibly hold their own against these fighters			1
they eat the eggs and larvae of fish , and the plankton that the larvae would eat			1
and through this double whammy of predation and competition , they can cripple an ecosystem at the ankles			0
but jellyfish do other harm , which is only just beginning to be appreciated			2
they flip the food chain upside down			0
normally as you go up the food chain , the energy value increases			0
for example , shrimp pack more energy than their plankton prey , but big fish that eat shrimp are better still			1
@entity189 , jellyfish , a very low - energy choice compared with shrimp or fish , are sequestering the higher energy of these species into their own low - energy bodies			1
they are , in essence , spinning gold into straw , or turning wine into water			2
in a healthy ecosystem , fish are superior competitors and predators over jellyfish			1
but the things we humans do -- we fish , we pollute , we dam , we build , we translocate -- are making life harder for fish and better for jellyfish			1
and so , as we look around the world , we see that many of the most heavily disturbed ecosystems have " flipped " to being dominated by jellyfish instead of fish			1
moon jellies and comb jellies in the @entity223			0
sea nettles in the @entity44 and the @entity225 off @entity48			0
comb jellies in the seas of @entity228			2
@entity230 's hat jellies in the fjords of @entity131			0
refrigerator - sized jellies growing in the seas of @entity43 and drifting into @entity235 and @entity236 waters			1
and once in control , they do n't seem to be letting go			0
so , we find ourselves in the unimaginable position of being in competition with jellyfish -- and make no mistake , they have the home - court advantage			1
so , what can we do ? what should we do ? that 's the problem			0
the ocean is our life support system -- it 's where we get our food , our oxygen , many of our industries and often our inspiration			0
but we do n't have a solution for the damages we are causing			0
we need to buy time , so solutions can be innovated			0
we need to invest in research to slow down the damage as well as to cope with our rapidly changing world			0
and we need to begin serious dialogue about what we value and what we are willing to do to preserve it			0
we could start by legislating a clean - to - intake standard in which any air or water discharged by industry must be at least as clean as it was going in , or the industry is not permitted to operate			1
sure , there would be great gnashing of teeth , but quite quickly , polluting industries would have to innovate ways to be cleaner to stay economically viable			0
this is just one example , but we must think of many more			0
and we must do something			0
i read somewhere recently that we in all likelihood will go down in history as the generation that could have saved the ocean but chose not to			0
it made me cry , because i fear it is true			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity291 .			2

@entity291 - ann @entity291 : jellyfish taking over *vulnerable* seas , displacing other creatures
she says jellyfish can kill off fish - sustaining krill that 's *harvested* for omega - 3 supplements
@entity291 : jellyfish thrive as oceans get warmer ; they eat the eggs and larvae of fish
@entity291 : we need to make industry stop polluting water and prevent global warming
