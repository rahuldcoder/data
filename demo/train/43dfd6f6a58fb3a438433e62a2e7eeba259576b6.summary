it 's largely devoid of human life , dark and viciously cold at times and frequently subject to dangerous levels of geological volatility -- the @entity5 is surely the worst possible destination for an arts festival			1
that has n't put off the organizers of @entity10 -- an event aimed at bringing entertainment to remote regions while showcasing the bleak but beautiful landscapes to new audiences			1
if that does n't sound tough enough -- the event is due to last for eight years			2
and it gets underway as winter approaches			0
" ninety percent of festivals are in the summer when the weather is hopefully nice , " says @entity20 , a veteran festival organizer who , with @entity22 curator @entity21 , is @entity10 's driving force			1
" we 're interested in the possibilities across the year in these regions , especially when the light dwindles in december			2
we want to use nature to make this event			2
" @entity21 says the festival is an attempt to explore the " @entity5 state of mind " using landscapes as a gateway into local lifestyles			1
the program features performances from the @entity40 , @entity22 dj @entity41 , and @entity43 , a female vocal group from @entity44 , @entity22			1
the headline act -- at least until february 2015 -- is an outdoor film installation by @entity48 filmmaker and artist @entity49 , the first of what @entity52 hopes will be numerous international contributions			0
supersized sauna although @entity10 kicks off on august 29 on @entity56 , in northern @entity22 , just as the last warmth of summer evaporates , the festival has a steamy secret weapon up its sleeve			1
it 'll debut " @entity62 , " a giant insulated amphitheater that will host film screenings , seminars and larger concerts			0
when the weather gets particularly rough , the facility transforms into a sauna , releasing enough sweltering heat for 120 people			0
@entity10 will spend a year on @entity72 before moving to destinations including @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , the @entity78 and @entity79			1
@entity81 structures have already begun to populate the island			2
along a two - kilometer beach strip , colossal fish racks mirroring the region 's age - old trading culture will double as a performance arenas for artists			1
festival - goers will also be invited to exchange their tents with a " njalla , " a tiny mobile hut kitted out with a glass roof to view the northern lights			2
instead of the usual festival unhealthy fast food selection , there 'll be fresh fish and ethically sourced meat			0
well - equipped cabins @entity21 says one of @entity10 's goals is to show participants how the @entity5 's peripatetic population has traditionally lived in harmony with its environment			1
" nature is quite vulnerable in these regions and this was of course the knowledge that the nomads had , " she says			0
" their way of living was really about ' living with this ' and using nature in a very sustainable and careful way			0
" of course , unlike festival - goers , these nomads were n't residing in cabins equipped with comfy bunks and wood - burning stoves			2
" the idea behind the project is to embrace the philosophy of movement here , when we are moving around to @entity74 , @entity79 or wherever we are going , we want make as few footprints as possible , " says @entity21			1
" people living up here have always brought their houses and belongings with them on a constant basis -- they had to move , " says @entity20			2
" it 's actually very hard to see the people who have been living here ... footprints are few			0
" the roughness of the weather coupled with the scenery 's beauty make for an experience that 's sure to astound and revitalize bored metropolitans -- provided their huts do n't get blown to pieces			2
@entity21 says that city dwellers can learn a lot from the living conditions of @entity5 territories			1
she says that swapping their worlds of dwindling leisure time and excessive working hours for lands where elk and deer populations far exceed humans will help them gain a new sense of perspective			0
" most of us who live in big cities have this feeling of fragmentation , this loss of something to hold on to , " she says			0
" when you reach this beach and come to this place ... there is something happening with you , you get the feeling that you 're part of something so much bigger than yourself			0
" the @entity10 festival comes at a particularly significant time for the @entity5			1
several countries are eyeing the untapped resources that lie dormant under its mounds of ice and rocky land , while climate change is affecting the region at twice the rate of the rest of the world			0
climate fluctuation trekking across @entity22 throughout 2011 and 2012 , @entity21 and @entity20 were astounded by the climate 's fluctuations			1
@entity21 recalls the sensitive landscapes			0
" when it comes to climate change and environmental challenges you can see this very clearly in the @entity5			1
we have these huge ice mountains that are melting , every year huge parts of these areas are gone , " she says			0
" we also see it in the extreme weather -- northern @entity22 is usually quite rough in the summer season , but now , it 's been 30 degrees ( @entity204 ) almost all summer			1
it 's crazy , it should n't be 30 degrees up here ! " the pair say the planet 's northern reaches act as a true barometer for global warming , and as the region is exposed to a wider audience , its changing landscape wo n't be so easily ignored			0
" the way we live today across the world means that we 're shortening the future , " says @entity21			0
" this landscape is reminding us of something that we need to be reminded of			0
" @entity220 will debut on the island of @entity72 , @entity22 , running from august 29 , 2014 to september 6 , 2015 .			1

@entity220 to kick off on the @entity22 island of @entity72 from august 29
organizers hope the eight - year event will draw attention to the beauty and *fragility* of @entity5 region
events will move from @entity22 to @entity74 , the @entity78 and @entity75
