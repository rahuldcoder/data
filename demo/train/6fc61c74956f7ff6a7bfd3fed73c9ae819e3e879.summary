-- most of us pick up a razor at least every couple of days , and although shaving 's a little tedious , it 's not too much of a hassle			1
many men still prefer shaving with straight razors , although safety razors date back to at least 1762			2
it has n't always been quite so easy , though			2
let 's take a look at the history of shaving			1
@entity15 could get a little rough in the days before razors , you could either sport a hirsute look or get creative			0
records drawn on cave walls show prehistoric people shaving with clamshells , flint knives , and even shark teeth			1
it 's not clear when these crude implements gave way to what we now think of as razors			2
according to the @entity33 , circular solid gold or copper razors can be found as far back as the @entity34 in some @entity36 tombs			0
still other cultures sharpened volcanic obsidian glass and used those			0
another story posits that the @entity42 king @entity41 introduced the razor to his people in the 6th century @entity45 , but shaving did n't really catch on with @entity47 for another hundred years or so			1
in the 4th century @entity45 , @entity48 encouraged his men to shave so enemies could n't grab their beards during melees			1
@entity48 's subjects were often shaved using a novacila , a block of iron with one edge sharpened , which sounds like a great way to shred your face			1
@entity61 supposedly preferred to have his beard plucked out with tweezers , although other @entity42 men used razors or rubbed the beards from their faces using pumice stones			1
( ouch ! ) @entity0 : when did women start shaving their armpits ? is it safe ? designs for safety razors date back to at least 1762 , but they did n't really catch on until 1828 , when they debuted in @entity75 , @entity76			1
in 1847 @entity77 invented the hoe - shaped razor that most of us have in our medicine cabinets , and in 1895 a traveling salesman named @entity82 combined this shape with the idea of shaving with a disposable double - edged blade			2
the resulting safety razor eventually made @entity87 a fortune and solved the hassle of having to remove the razor 's blade to sharpen it every few shaves			2
the idea was great , but there was a problem : the blades were n't easy to make			2
it took another six years for @entity87 to find someone who could actually make the disposable blades			2
@entity101 professor @entity100 joined up with @entity87 to figure out a way to stamp the blades out of sheets of high - carbon steel , and by 1903 they had their first batch of razors ready to take on @entity110 's beards			1
by 1906 @entity87 's design was moving 300,000 units a year			0
interestingly , @entity82 sold the razors at a loss , but he more than made up for it by selling the blades at a huge profit			0
although @entity87 's invention came from his notion that he should invent something people bought , threw away , and then repurchased , he was n't your typical capitalist			1
he became a strong proponent of utopian socialism later in his life and planned a community in @entity128 in which engineers would rationally orchestrate all activity			0
@entity82 even offered @entity131 $ 1 million to serve as president of this planned utopia in 1910 , but @entity131 declined			0
@entity0 : @entity135 's jungle utopia 1920s : shaving goes electric people have been patenting and trying to market electric razors since 1900 , but at first they met with little success			1
( @entity140 failed model from 1910 ran on clockwork			0
) in 1928 a retired @entity144 colonel named @entity145 patented an electric razor he had designed , and the world finally had a winner			1
@entity145 razors took store shelves by storm in 1931 , and they quickly sold millions of units			1
the real winners in this transition from wet shaving with soap and a brush to electric razors were badgers			0
their hair had been highly prized for wet shaving brushes because it retained water so well , so more than a few badgers were spared a shearing as @entity110 started plugging in their electric @entity165			0
like @entity82 , @entity145 was a bit of an odd duck			1
part of the reason he went into the shaving business was that he really , really believed in the benefits of shaving			0
in fact , @entity145 supposedly thought that if a man shaved often enough , he could lengthen his life to 120 years			1
@entity0 : revisiting 8 ' @entity180 ' rumors the real arms race started in the 1960s after years of losing market share to their electric competition , @entity82 finally hit upon a winning innovation in 1960 when it introduced stainless steel blades			0
these newer blades were tougher to hone , but they lasted much longer and did n't rust			0
@entity193 introduced the first totally disposable razors in the sixties as well , which made shaving even more convenient			0
@entity82 struck another blow in 1971 when it introduced the two - blade razor			0
other companies followed suit , and now it 's just a matter of time before we 're all shaving with a 17 - bladed behemoth			2
