-- it 's no coincidence that @entity3 's latest exhibition is located in @entity4 , a former jail that sits on an isolated island off the @entity7 coast			1
the @entity9 artist and activist explores themes of imprisonment , featuring prisoners of conscience from around the world			1
it 's also familiar territory for @entity3 , who was detained by @entity9 authorities for 81 days in 2011 and still can not travel out of @entity9			1
visitors to @entity3 's exhibit , called @ large , can sit in a drab , 8x5 feet concrete cell and listen to the works of dissidents , such as @entity24 singers and @entity26 musicians whose poems or songs landed them in prison			1
among them is @entity31 , a @entity32 singer whose song implores the children of @entity35 to " raise the @entity32 flag			2
" @entity31 is serving a six - year prison sentence for calling for independence -- a direct challenge to @entity9 's rule			1
in another installation , the image of @entity42 , the @entity43 winner , fashioned out of black , grey , blue and white @entity44 peers out at visitors			2
@entity42 , who called for the end of @entity9 's single - party rule , is serving an 11 - year prison sentence			1
@entity51 and ' june fourth ' in the body of @entity42 the theme of confinement and suppression runs throughout the former @entity58 federal penitentiary			2
although @entity4 is better known for holding feared inmates like @entity58 gangster @entity61 , the prison also held @entity62 who balked at mandatory @entity58 assimilation policies and conscientious objectors , who refused to serve in the military on political or religious grounds			1
photos : a @entity9 dragon in @entity4 @entity3 does n't back off critiquing the @entity58 , by crediting @entity70 and @entity71 among the 176 people around the world who have been imprisoned or exiled because of their beliefs or affiliations			1
he pays tribute to them by forming their faces out of 1.2 million @entity44 pieces			0
contemporary artistic dissent through his art , @entity3 declares : " every one of us is a potential convict			1
" when @entity3 's exhibit on @entity4 officially opened in late september , it coincided with mass pro-democracy protests in @entity89			1
during that weekend , police in @entity89 arrested about 70 student protesters , including several of its young leaders , in the mass call for democracy			0
that protest , fueled by youngsters , is now continuing into its fourth week in @entity89			0
it 's important that the work can appeal to the next generation , says @entity100 , the curator of the @ large exhibit			1
some of the artworks are interactive , encouraging viewers to walk , view more closely or even get involved -- especially in one installation where they can write postcards to imprisoned dissidents			1
" it invigorates the viewers to interact with the work , " said @entity100 , the executive director of for - site , a foundation which organized the exhibit			2
they also brought wifi to @entity4 for the first time so visitors could send @entity116 and tweets from the island			2
" it 's keeping with the artist 's desire to activate the next generation 's conversation , " @entity100 said			2
in a sense , it already has			0
protest art has proliferated on the streets of @entity89 , whether it 's calling for democracy or lampooning its chief executive through postcards , paintings and pop - up installations			0
symbols of democracy and free speech plaster the walls , highway barriers , bridges and stairways			0
umbrellas , which symbolize the @entity89 protests , dot the roads			0
slogans are painted on posters hanging from prominent bridges -- suggesting the political power of art. inside a prison cell as @entity3 is still unable to leave @entity9 , he and his team constructed the pieces in their studio			1
he then sent three teams to the @entity58 to erect the seven art installations inside @entity4 's dining room , labor building , the psychiatric observation cells , hopsital and inside the cell block			1
perhaps the most haunting of exhibits is " stay tuned , " where the voice of dissent singing or reciting a poem or speech booms inside the small , isolated prison cells			0
housed inside @entity168 , there 's a haunting chill within the concrete mass. each prison cell behind chipped white steel bars contains just a solitary stool and a stained white sink			0
some of the cells in @entity176 were used for solitary confinement			0
visitors can walk inside each of the 12 cells , which represent the imprisonment of dissidents like @entity184 's @entity183 , @entity185 , and the @entity186 , who were @entity24 singers			2
they can sit inside the barren concrete cell and listen to their voices			0
one visit @entity191 , sat inside each of them , closing her eyes shut			0
" it 's a powerful access to something so tragic and breathtaking , " she said			0
the voice of dissident plays in a loop -- but the sound remains confined into a prison reminding visitors of the cost of free expression .			0
