-- at least one in six people worldwide does n't have access to clean water , and this contributes to about 1.5 million preventable deaths each year , according to the @entity7			1
@entity8 , a top 10 @entity9 in 2009 , is trying to help change that			1
through his nonprofit , @entity11 , the former bartender from @entity13 has helped provide clean water to more than 150,000 people in 17 countries			1
wine - tasting events are one way @entity8 and his group raise the funds that enable them to distribute water filters and help install wells in communities around the world			1
and in april , bartenders from 16 countries donated their tips to the cause			2
@entity8 recently talked with @entity0 about the water crisis and his efforts to help people impacted by the @entity35 civil war and the recent typhoon in the @entity37			1
@entity0 : what should people know about the water crisis ? @entity8 : it takes many women and children four and five hours , every single day , just to get water			1
and then it 's absolutely filthy , and it 's making their children sick			0
diarrhea kills more children under 5 than @entity51 , malaria and measles combined			0
and 88 % of ( those ) deaths are caused by poor sanitation , unsafe drinking water and poor hygiene			2
a lot of people ask me , " if this water crisis is so bad , how come we have n't heard much about it ? " well , here in the @entity65 , we help support things that we can empathize with			1
we know what it 's like to lose a loved one to a disease like cancer			0
we understand what it means to need a good , solid education for a child			0
so ( those causes ) get a lot of the spotlight			0
but it 's hard for us to empathize with the water crisis			2
we wash our cars ; we water our lawn			2
we just ca n't imagine what it 's like to not have access to water			1
@entity0 : why did you start working on this issue ? @entity8 : i began raising funds to support the fight against the global water crisis back in 2004 , and i had an opportunity to live in @entity93 , @entity94 , during the height of the genocide there			1
my job was to ( work in ) refugee camps and get them access to water			1
when i first started witnessing these women and children and the effort they would go through for a cup of water , and then to see actually the water that they were providing to their kids -- when you see that firsthand , you ca n't help but be changed			2
when i came home , it 's all i could think about			0
so i decided this is what i want to do with my life			0
@entity0 : why did you get involved in the situation in @entity35 ? @entity8 : right now in @entity35 , every single day , thousands of people are fleeing their homes because of this fighting ... going to an unknown future , with no resources			1
in these ( displacement ) camps , a lot of the men have either been killed or they 're all fighting , so it 's mostly populated by children and women			0
the vast majority is children			0
and as you know , a lot of these kids ' systems are very weak , and they 're drinking filthy water			2
my first thought was , " let 's see if we can get some water filters into these camps			2
" another big reason for me was that the first country i worked in , @entity94 , was a predominantly @entity150 country , and i 've really felt a connection with the @entity150 world ever since			0
i really wanted to get out there and reach out , to show that we want to help in any way we can			0
@entity0 : what are you doing to help ? @entity8 : we created a partnership with @entity160 ( a @entity162 - based @entity150 charity ) , and right now we 're actively working in two camps in the northwestern region , near border areas between @entity35 and @entity166			1
i was able to ( go ) inside some of these camps , inside @entity35			1
... the living conditions , they 're terrible			0
on that trip , i was able to bring about 350 filters with me			0
until we can get each household to have their own water filter , which is the ultimate goal , we have a couple of distribution areas where people can come with their buckets of water and run ( it ) through a number of filters in order to clean it			1
when it 's not an emergency situation , we can go into an area and teach them , using their local resources , how to build their own water filter			2
but in a war zone , like what 's going on in @entity35 , we just need to get a clean water fix immediately			1
@entity35 is the very first location that we 're using these @entity198 filters			2
we 're really excited about them			0
if they 're used properly , they will last 10 years and filter 250 gallons of water every day			2
@entity0 : do you ever worry about the risk ? @entity8 : going inside @entity35 reminds me a lot of my time ( in @entity94 )			1
when i was younger , i was a little more reckless ; i did n't have as much to lose			0
now i have a wife and two kids , and so i do find myself thinking , " is this work really worth risking my life over ? " you know , when you see these families get to access clean water , it makes the answer pretty easy : of course it 's worth it			1
a lot of people think because the number is so big , what can one person really do ? it 's just too overwhelming			0
but if you think , " i could help one other person or five other people or one village , " you can make a huge difference			0
@entity0 : you were just in the @entity37 , where you and @entity230 , the 2009 @entity9 , were helping people impacted by the typhoon			1
how did that go ? @entity8 : having so much support from @entity230 and all of his contacts helped the process go much more smoothly than it normally would			1
we brought about 2,000 filters , and we 've been able to partner with a local water company , @entity240 , that 's helping us provide 500 more			2
they are interested in doing even more , so with their support we now may be able to reach out to a huge number of people			0
that really upped the ante for us			0
... there 's just so much to do in the @entity37			0
there are so many disasters there -- not just typhoons , but earthquakes			0
and lots of villages we went to did n't have clean water before the typhoon , and now things are much worse			1
so there 's lots of work to do there , but we 're excited about having the chance to help			0
