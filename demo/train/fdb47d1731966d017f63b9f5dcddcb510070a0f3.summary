-- @entity1 may be @entity4 's most important @entity3 ally , but the relationship between the two countries is on the rocks			1
on thursday , @entity1 expelled a top @entity9 agent from @entity10 , a highly unusual move for which the @entity1 government cited a " lack of cooperation " from the @entity4 in clarifying recent spying cases			1
those cases include revelation that the @entity9 tried to recruit a @entity1 secret service staffer to sell classified information , and the possibility that a @entity23 employee had been working for @entity4 intelligence			1
@entity1 policymakers and journalists are up in arms , with @entity4 diplomats struggling to contain the political damage			1
in a recent poll , only 35 % of @entity1 said the @entity4 can be trusted			1
this is a stunning vote of no confidence amid continued public uproar about the @entity35 's tapping of chancellor @entity37 's cell phone			0
for those dedicated to the trans - @entity41 alliance , the current atmosphere is more depressing than during the height of the @entity45 war , when chancellor @entity46 and president @entity47 made no secret of their antipathy			0
long gone are times like when 200,000 @entity1 cheered for candidate @entity52 as he spoke under @entity10 's @entity53 in summer 2008			1
gone , too , are @entity52 's 75 % approval ratings among @entity1			2
the @entity4 has very few friends in @entity10 these days			1
even traditionally pro-american policy - and opinion - makers keep a low profile , and almost no one is prepared to publicly defend the @entity4			2
many say they are fed up with @entity4 's explanations and excuses , and it is hard to blame them			2
in contrast , those in @entity1 who argue that the country should pursue an even course between the @entity4 and @entity64 , instead of partnering with the @entity4 , are in " i told you so " mode , saying that @entity4 are not worthy of a trusting relationship			1
legitimate criticism of intelligence overreach is now solidifying into genuine anti-american sentiment , with deeply corrosive effects on bilateral ties			0
germans are very sensitive about data protection			0
this is rooted in @entity80 and @entity81 traditions of comprehensive surveillance and terror			0
but that 's only part of the story			0
many in the @entity1 business community are trying to protect their investments in @entity64 from @entity4 - led sanctions			1
a new generation of @entity1 in their 20s and 30s know the @entity4 only in its post- 9/11 guise : @entity95 , @entity45 , surveillance , fingerprinting at the borders , spying on friendly nations and their leaders , renditions and targeted killings			1
it is not uncommon to hear young @entity1 ask : " what makes the @entity4 different from @entity64 or @entity105 ? " it is easy to dismiss such distorted perceptions , but they matter			1
@entity4 is increasingly seen as a paranoid society that can not distinguish between friends and foes anymore			1
this perception is eroding @entity4 's standing in the world			0
as one @entity10 policymaker suggested : " the @entity4 is digging its own grave with regard to its global leadership aspirations			1
" in addition , there is a widespread feeling among government officials , scholars and businessmen that the @entity4 " still does n't get it " and is not prepared to seriously discuss the rules of engagement when it comes to surveillance of close allies			2
we should not underestimate the damage this perception has already inflicted			0
during the @entity45 war , many @entity1 rationalized their discontent with @entity4 policy by separating the likes of @entity47 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 -- bad apples in their minds -- from what they saw as the " good @entity4			1
" this time , @entity1 disappointment and anger is proportionate to the high expectations of the @entity52 era			0
many just say that the @entity4 can not and should not be trusted anymore , and that any special relationship is gone for good			0
@entity1 has reacted this week partly from genuine anger and partly in response to public opinion			0
@entity4 ambassador @entity150 was summoned to the @entity151 just hours before the large annual @entity153 reception at the @entity154			0
it was " nothing that we liked to do but it was necessary , " said one @entity1 official			0
members of the governing coalition are openly asking to expel @entity4 intelligence personnel from @entity1 and order the @entity162 ( @entity1 's foreign intelligence agency ) to cease all cooperation with @entity4 services			2
even @entity1 president @entity165 , usually a measured man , could not resist making a populist " enough is enough " statement			0
the current turmoil is reversing modest gains that have been made by the cyber dialogue established by the @entity170 with the @entity1 government in the wake of the @entity35 revelations			0
the first meeting took place on june 26 in @entity10 , ending a day before news broke that the @entity9 attempted to recruit a junior @entity162 agent			1
for the @entity4 , references to ongoing internal review will not cut it this time			0
as annoying as public debates in @entity1 might be to @entity4 leaders , the @entity4 can not afford to ignore them			2
the @entity1 require a serious conversation about national interest , the trans - @entity41 partnership , and intelligence gathering			2
this will be mutually beneficial , as it will force @entity1 to make up their mind as to what role they want to play and perhaps help the @entity4 establish a true cost - benefit analysis of its intelligence activities .			2

@entity1 expelled a top @entity9 agent from @entity10 in light of recent spying cases
@entity199 : @entity1 is an important ally for @entity4 , but now relations are strained
he says @entity4 is *perceived* as a paranoid society that ca n't tell friends from foes
@entity208 : @entity4 and @entity1 need to talk about the *transatlantic* partnership and spying
