@entity2 , left , @entity10 and @entity2 co-authored " looking for @entity11			1
" in fact , eminent @entity9 historian @entity12 said there 's only one other family that 's contributed more " to our understanding of @entity20 's most enduring leader , " and that 's the @entity22 themselves			2
" the @entity23 -- and before them , their ancestor @entity25 -- have been active , and crucial for generations , in preserving @entity9 's image for posterity , " @entity12 said			1
" mr. @entity29 literally saved photos from destruction , then cataloged and analyzed them			0
later members of the family wrote seminal books incorporating the family - owned archive into the stories of @entity9 's life and death			1

my great - great - grandfather was a man by the name of @entity25			1
his father , @entity29 , was a soldier in the @entity71 who was wounded at the battle of @entity73 , and he kept a diary of the entire time he was in war			0
that diary was illustrated by his son , @entity78 , years after the war through collecting photography			2
he became one of the leading collectors of 19th - century @entity20 photography			2
... at that time photography was still quite new			0
in the late 19th century , the war - weary nation lost its interest in the images of that era			1
many glass negatives were thought to be worthless			0
the emulsion was washed off , and many were used to build greenhouses			0
@entity29 wrote a book in 1911 called " photographs of @entity9			2
" he became obsessed with @entity9			0
@entity9 was the first president to be photographed while in office			2
@entity29 's goal in life was to find and catalog all the existing images of @entity9 , of which we now know there were about 120			2
each photograph in @entity29 's book , which he updated for the next half century , was given an " m " number			0
part of our work was to update his numbering system and establish a new national standard			2
then his daughter @entity110 , she became heavily involved with @entity11 scholarship and the collection as well			1
she was the author of the children 's book , " @entity119 , " which ... as everyone knows today , it 's one of the most popular children 's books			0
she worked with her father on @entity9 publications and continued to collect @entity9			0
the collection was passed to @entity123 , my grandfather , who eventually passed this collection of photographs on to my father and uncle , who were my co-authors in this book , " looking for @entity11			1
" my grandfather , father and uncle wrote a book on @entity9 in 1992 called " @entity11 : an @entity135 , " using the contents of the collection			1
each generation has continued the fascination with the collection but with a special interest in @entity9			0
@entity0 : what 's your involvement now in the collection ? @entity2 : my role is the assistant director of the @entity50			1
the foundation was established in 2002 by my father and uncle in order to preserve our family 's collection and make it available to the public			2
during the past century , the collection had grown so large that we decided it was finally time to place it in public hands			0
that is why we first formed the @entity50			0
and this year the collection will be moved to the @entity163 at the @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity166 , and the @entity167 at @entity164 , where it will be made available to students and scholars			0
@entity0 : was there ever any doubt in your mind that you wanted to go into this field ? @entity2 : i was an art history major at @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity178			1
i 've always been fascinated with our collection			0
i was flattered to be asked to help with this project , the @entity11 book			1
i 've been an intern since i was about in fifth grade			0
i 've grown up knowing this collection very well , putting everything in plastic sleeves			0
then when we found out that they were n't of archival quality , i had to change them to polyester sleeves			0
it 's really been a family love			2
we 've all grown up with this collection			0
a great portion of this collection is now housed at the @entity198			0
it was sold after my great - grandmother 's death			2
@entity0 : what are some of the most valuable parts of the collection ? @entity2 : it includes many gems , like @entity209 's oversized portrait of @entity9 that was taken just before he went to @entity210			1
as a young boy , i remember it hanging on the walls of our home			0
we also own the bronze life mask of @entity11 cast by @entity218			1
@entity0 : was @entity9 particularly interested in being photographed ? @entity2 : it was his way of reaching out to a wider audience			1
it was a process that was so slow , he had to sit for long periods of time with a neck brace in order to be photographed because the exposure time was forever			0
there are pictures where if he moved just slightly , the picture was blurry			0
crowd scenes are always blurry because you could n't make the crowd stay still			0
@entity0 : what 's the story of the @entity55 ? @entity2 : my grandfather @entity123 was managing editor of @entity238			1
he and @entity240 became close personal friends , and shortly before both of them died in 2006 , my grandfather showed @entity240 how we were preserving our 19th - century collection			2
after @entity240 's death , his estate placed all of his photographs with us , and we formed the @entity55			0
@entity0 : what else are you working on ? @entity2 : our next book is " @entity252 , " which will be published in september 2009			1
we 're taking the @entity11 photographs and blowing them up to the actual size of @entity9 's face ... and it will include his own reactions to some of the photographs .			1
