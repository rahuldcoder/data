@entity0 , @entity1 -- a judge was considering monday whether to grant a request for a fresh autopsy on the body of the @entity8 student @entity9 , killed in the @entity1 city of @entity0			1
@entity9 was found dead in her villa november 2 with a knife wound to her neck			2
@entity16 's corpse is still being held in a morgue in @entity8 as her family awaits permission to bury the 21 - year - old who bled to death after she was stabbed in her bed			1
the request was received from the lawyers of @entity9 , one of the four suspects identified by @entity1 police			1
@entity28 , a lawyer for @entity29 - who was released by @entity1 police last week but still remains a suspect in the killing - said they wanted to establish more closely the time of death of the victim			1
the decision on a second autopsy is expected some time tuesday , @entity37 , the @entity16 family 's lawyer , told reporters in @entity0 monday			1
@entity37 told @entity2 that @entity1 investigators would travel to @entity41 to carry out a second autopsy if it was granted			2
@entity16 , an exchange student at @entity0 's university , was killed late on november 1 in the villa where she lived , according to police			1
investigators found her the next day , half - naked , with a stab wound to her neck			0
a report issued more than a week ago by an @entity1 judge suggested she may have been sexually assaulted at knifepoint before she was killed in her bed			2
the original post-mortem put the time of death at between 10 p.m. and midnight , according to a report from @entity0 's prosecutor general @entity55			2
however , @entity55 said that @entity16 probably suffered a " very slow agony " as she bled to death and that the wound could have been inflicted as early as 8:30 p.m. and that she could have died at any time up to 11:30 p.m. @entity29 , a @entity59 bar owner , says he has a solid alibi for the time of the killing , according to his lawyers			2
the autopsy request came a day after the latest suspect in the case , @entity66 , 20 , claimed that an unidentified assailant attacked the @entity8 student , his lawyer told @entity2 sunday			1
@entity66 has already admitted being in @entity16 's home the night she was killed , but denies any involvement in her death , his lawyer , @entity71 , told @entity2			1
last week , investigators said dna on a vaginal swab taken from @entity16 matched @entity66 's dna , indicating the two had sex			2
@entity1 police say that they have connected @entity66 to a bloody fingerprint on a pillow at the crime scene , and that dna tests on skin cells found on toilet paper there have linked him to the villa			0
the suspect , arrested last week after fleeing to @entity89 , claimed he was in the bathroom when he heard @entity16 screaming from the bedroom , @entity71 said			2
he claimed he saw a person , whom he describes as " the killer , " outside the bedroom door , and that when he went to help the victim she whispered " @entity97 " into his ear , his lawyer said			0
@entity66 tried to confront the person , but the assailant ran away , according to @entity71			0
his lawyer said @entity66 denies that he and @entity16 slept together			0
media reports in @entity1 and @entity8 say police are looking at the possibility of a fifth suspect involved in the killing following @entity66 's claims			1
but a source in the prosecutor 's office in @entity0 told @entity2 that no fifth suspect was being sought in connection with the killing			1
@entity66 is the only suspect to have acknowledged having been in @entity16 's villa the night she died			1
he is expected to be extradited in the next 10 to 15 days on suspicion of murder and sexual assault			0
in addition to @entity66 , two other suspects remain in custody in connection with the killing : @entity118 , 20 , @entity16 's roommate , and @entity121 's boyfriend , @entity122 , 23			1
a source in the prosecutor 's office said forensic police will return to the villa before friday 's court hearing to determine whether @entity129 and @entity121 should continue to be held by police			0
the source said forensics investigators had discovered impressions on the victim 's bra , which was found near her body , and were trying to determine if the impressions are fingerprints			0
according to a report in the @entity1 daily newspaper @entity139 saturday , @entity122 said in a statement to police that @entity121 lived in a dream world but said she was not a murderer			0
" she lives life as if it is a dream , she 's out of touch with reality			0
but from here to even just imagining that she is a murderer , it becomes impossible , " the newspaper reported @entity122 as saying			0
@entity121 , from @entity154 , has told police that she is unclear about what took place on the night of @entity16 's death			1
even the @entity161 's lawyer has admitted he was confused by his client 's testimony			0
both @entity121 and @entity122 deny any involvement in the killing			0
e-mail to a friend @entity2 's @entity168 in @entity0 contributed to this report .			0
