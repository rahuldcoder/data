@entity0 , @entity1 -- notions of a cease - fire in @entity1 quickly faded saturday as a battle raged for control of the oil town of @entity8 , where rebel fighters claimed they had lost fighters and vehicles to @entity13 airstrikes			1
airstrikes hit several rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters , spokesmen for the @entity1 opposition said saturday			1
@entity13 was investigating the incident , a spokeswoman said saturday			0
" @entity13 takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously , but exact details are hard to verify as we have no reliable sources on the ground , " @entity13 's @entity22 said			1
" clearly , if someone fires at one of our aircraft , of course they have the right to defend themselves			0
" rebel spokesman @entity37 said opposition fighters had retaken @entity8 after a night of heavy fighting with @entity41 's forces			1
but it was not immediately clear who commanded control saturday of the coastal city that has now changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of the @entity1 war			0
meanwhile , in @entity51 , east of @entity0 , two mortars landed at a medical clinic saturday evening , causing one death and numerous injuries , said a medical official with the city 's main hospital			1
the doctor , who was not identified for security reasons , told @entity2 the clinic that was attacked had evacuated patients because of recent attacks , but was being guarded by opposition " fighters and young people			1
" one person was killed and 15 injured , said the doctor , who was caring for the wounded			0
five had serious injuries , including head and chest trauma , he said			0
forces loyal to @entity41 showed no signs of backing down after officials spurned an opposition cease - fire proposal			1
@entity76 spokesman @entity75 told reporters in @entity0 on friday that rebels were not " really serious " about the offer , which he said included " silly conditions			1
" " they are asking us to withdraw from our own cities and open our cities to people , who are holding up arms , who are tribal , violent , no unified leadership , @entity89 links , and no one knows who they are			0
if this is not mad , then i do n't know what it is , " he said			0
" we will not leave our cities			0
we will not stop protecting our civilians			0
" his comments came after @entity1 opposition leader @entity100 laid out cease - fire conditions that included freedom of expression for the @entity1 people and the removal of snipers , mercenaries and militias from western cities			1
ultimately , he said , the opposition 's goal remains regime change in @entity1			2
@entity37 sought to clarify the opposition 's position saturday			2
" there is no , and was no , negotiation on a cease - fire with colonel @entity41 's dictatorship , " he said at a @entity116 news conference			1
he repeated the opposition demands that @entity41 halt all military action , end the sieges laid on cities like @entity51 and allow free speech and assembly			1
sources close to @entity41 told @entity2 that political solutions are still possible but that the @entity1 leader would relinquish power only to others within his inner circle			2
they said there is still time for dialogue but expressed doubts about who would represent the opposition			2
any transition , they said , would involve @entity41 's second son , @entity140 , and for such a transition to take place there would first have to be an end to the fighting			0
the @entity1 sources told @entity2 that for now , @entity41 remains confident the regime can withstand any challenge from the rebels			2
@entity151 officials claim @entity41 's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of @entity155 - sanctioned airstrikes			2
the dictator 's forces , however , still outnumber rebels by about 10 to 1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , according to @entity163 adm. @entity162 , the @entity164 chairman			0
@entity2 's @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 contributed to this report			0
