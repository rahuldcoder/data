@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 warned lawmakers friday not to allow the nation 's democracy to be undermined , in an apparent criticism of anti-corruption campaigner @entity9 's high - profile hunger strike			1
his remarks came after @entity9 's public fast entered its 11th day , as the 74 - year - old activist presses for the creation of a powerful @entity14 , or citizen ombudsman , to tackle corruption			1
" individuals have brought our country great gains			0
they have galvanized people in the cause of freedom and development			0
however , we must not weaken the democratic process , " @entity2 , who is tipped by @entity3 media as a future prime minister , told parliament in a speech			1
he thanked @entity9 for articulating what he called larger public disillusionment with a system plagued by massive corruption			1
but in his address to the national assembly , the 40 - year - old general secretary of @entity3 's governing @entity35 cautioned against pressuring elected institutions			1
" this ( democratic ) process is often lengthy and lumbering			0
but it is so in order to be inclusive and fair			0
it provides a representative and transparent platform where ideas are translated into laws , " said @entity2 , whose @entity44 - born mother @entity43 heads the @entity35			2
" a process divorced from the machinery of an elected government , or this house , that seeks to undo the checks and balances created to protect the supremacy of parliament sets a dangerous precedent for a democracy , " he told the lower chamber of elected lawmakers			2
three of @entity2 's ancestors -- @entity63 , @entity64 and his father @entity65 -- have served as the country 's prime minister in the past			1
echoing current prime minister @entity70 's views that any institution alone can not eradicate deeply - entrenched corruption , @entity2 described the proposed @entity14 as just one tool in the fight against graft			1
" witnessing the events of the last few days it would appear that the enactment of a single bill will usher in a corruption - free society			0
i have serious doubts about this belief , " @entity2 said			2
" an effective @entity14 law is only one element in the legal framework to combat corruption			0
the @entity14 institution alone can not be a substitute for a comprehensive anti-corruption code			0
a set of effective laws is required , " he added			0
activists and the @entity3 government have been in talks for days , but there has been a deadlock primarily over three outstanding points to which campaigners want parliament and the government to agree			1
one of them relates to bringing @entity3 officials under the jurisdiction of the anti-corruption legislation .			2

@entity3 's @entity2 says a *watchdog* would not solve the *problem* of graft
@entity2 thanks fasting activist @entity9 for raising the issue of corruption
but he warns that parliament should not be put under pressure
@entity9 is into the 11th day of his hunger strike in @entity0
