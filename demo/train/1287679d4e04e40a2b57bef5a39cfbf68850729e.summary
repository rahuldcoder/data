-- @entity3 's @entity2 show " @entity8 " represents the reality of working in television news about as accurately as " @entity6 " captured working in politics -- which is to say , not at all			1
but both dramas did something more worthwhile : they expressed the idealism that should animate these careers			1
and in this time of creative destruction throughout the news industry , it 's more important than ever before			1
that 's why " @entity8 " matters			1
when " @entity6 " debuted in 1999 , the political arena was suffering from a well - deserved dose of @entity21 cynicism			0
the smart kids were all making piles of money on @entity25 by surfing the tech bubble , and with the 2000 election looming between @entity28 and @entity29 , the status quo of peace and prosperity seemed boring			0
but " @entity6 's " alternate reality -- with a @entity39 helmed by a flinty , @entity42 - born @entity41 - winning economist named @entity43 -- offered a glimpse into a less gray world , where the dialogue was as sharp as the sense of patriotic purpose			1
and through at least the first four seasons , written primarily by the show 's creator @entity3 , no matter which party you belonged to , once a week the show reminded you why you cared about politics in the first place			1
more than a dozen years later , " @entity8 " debuted on @entity2 ( which , by the way , is owned by @entity52 , @entity0 's parent company )			1
expectations were high , but the unremitting earnestness of the first season could be off - putting -- especially to journalists -- and made shrugging off the show more fashionable than saying you were a fan			1
but here 's the thing : @entity3 with a few miles per hour off his fastball is still better than almost anything else on television			0
despite the critics , the show 's lead character , @entity64 , quickly made an imprint on civic debates via social media , even if only as a peripheral fantasy about how the news could be			1
played by @entity72 , @entity64 is on a self - styled " mission to civilize , " and for all the @entity74 - meets - @entity76 posturing , his message was refreshing amid the high - water mark of hyperpartisan cheerleading that passed for much of cable news between the @entity82 wave of 2010 and the 2012 presidential election			1
@entity64 's fictitious prime - time show , " @entity85 , " is revived by dedication to the idea in this quote usually attributed to sen. @entity89 : " every one is entitled his own opinion , but not his own facts			1
" @entity3 is often accused of writing " liberal fantasies " -- a chorus president @entity95 joined with a gentle jab at the @entity98 dinner			0
but @entity64 's character is bearded a bit by making him a @entity102 @entity101 , who graduated from the district attorney 's office in @entity106 to serve as a speechwriter to the first president @entity28 before entering the tv fray			1
his politics are old - school " i like ike " main street republican , which is to say centrist in the current environment			0
@entity64 is quick to criticize liberals for their losing ways and the yippie - fueled unhinged extremism in the late ' 60s that caused the left to lose credibility for decades			1
but @entity64 's hottest criticism is reserved for the rise of right - wing radicalism , as in this famous diatribe : " ideological purity			1
a fundamentalist belief in scriptural literalism			0
a hostile fear of progress			0
a need to control women 's bodies			0
pathological hatred of the @entity143 government			0
they can call themselves the tea party			0
they can call themselves conservatives			0
and they can even call themselves @entity101 , though @entity101 certainly should n't			0
but we should call them what they are -- the @entity143 @entity155			0
" this intemperate , unvarnished surgical strike drew criticisms of the show in real - world media as well as a congressional condemnation in the show 's fictional universe			1
but @entity64 does not mistake the goal of nonpartisanship for neutrality			2
perhaps the biggest narrative risk of the show is its location in the recent past			0
the first season began with the @entity172 oil spill and hit heights with the shooting of @entity175 and the midterm elections			0
the second season started in the summer of 2011 , with the @entity101 presidential primaries , and already extends to the outburst of @entity180 in the early fall			0
this dynamic indulges a bit of instant nostalgia but also , as @entity3 explained on " @entity186 , " it allows the viewers to know more than the characters -- a neat trick			2
this kind of transference gave rise to perhaps the most interesting aspect of the show			0
between the seasons , the character of @entity64 waded into online political debates via @entity198 -- courtesy not of an enterprising pr firm , but of an otherwise anonymous 29 - year - old working for an airline , who is a major @entity3 fan and an aspiring screenwriter			1
the @ @entity206 tribute @entity198 handle has attracted more than 58,000 followers , including many journalists with whom he jousts in character			2
the point is that the character of @entity64 is so well developed that fans can adopt his voice and persona to engage in real debates and make some impact			1
that 's a mark of a fictional character that has come to life			2
and it indicates how much interest there is in a real - life newsman who would play the role of @entity64 -- razor - sharp , principled and ignorance - intolerant -- in real life			2
which brings me to the final reason " @entity8 " matters			2
at a time when trust in media is declining because of the rise of partisan news , when newspapers seem to be dying every day and online clicks reward stories about celebrity scandals and soft - focus pictures of kittens , " @entity8 " offers an inspirational alternate reality			1
the pr industry might be bigger than journalism and certainly pays better , so the attraction for young would - be reporters has to be something bigger than a paycheck or job stability			2
the attraction is a job that comes with a built - in sense of purpose , that sweet soul spot where idealism meets realism			0
that 's what journalism at its best promises to provide			2
and even though the reality might involve long hours , lots of criticism and little compensation , our democracy depends on it			0
so spare me the easy cynicism and petty complaints			0
if " @entity8 " helps inspire a few more talented young people to enter the world of journalism , as " @entity6 " did for a generation of politicos before it , that is a valuable contribution to contemporary culture -- and much more than most tv shows would ever promise to provide			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity280 .			2

@entity280 : " @entity8 " is n't reality , but it expresses idealism journalists feel
@entity280 : @entity186 's anchor @entity64 is now a character in social media , debates
he says when news is about stars and cats , " *newsroom* " offers inspiration
@entity280 : show could attract young , talented and idealistic to journalism careers
