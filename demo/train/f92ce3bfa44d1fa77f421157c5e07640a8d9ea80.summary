@entity0 -- the @entity2 announced the launch of an international investigation into a new deadly strain of bird flu , as the total number of infections in @entity9 rose to 87			1
" right now it is still an animal virus that rarely infects humans , " said dr. @entity10 , the head of the @entity2 's office in @entity0			2
@entity10 said one of the goals of the mission is to determine the source of the @entity20 virus which was first discovered only three weeks ago			1
officials from the @entity2 , as well as experts from the @entity23 and @entity25 @entity24 , are expected to investigate the virus alongside @entity9 health authorities in @entity28 and @entity0 in the coming days			1
five new infections of the @entity20 virus were recorded in @entity28 and nearby provinces of @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
on thursday , the government suspended wild bird sales to try to prevent the spread of the virus , although many questions remain as to the source of infection			1
it follows a ban on live poultry trading in affected provinces			0
a large number of birds have also been slaughtered , @entity45 said			0
in his statement to a room packed full of journalists , @entity10 said there was legitimate reason for concern about the new virus , but suggested it was premature to begin mass culling of poultry			2
" i eat chicken every day , " @entity10 said with a laugh			0
" chicken is of no concern at all			0
" however , posts on the country 's microblogging sites suggested that some users were anxious about going anywhere near poultry products			0
" after @entity20 , i do n't even dare to eat an egg			1
i ate lunch box every day			0
i want poultry , and i want meat ! ! ! " one wrote			0
another said : " @entity74 has @entity20 patient now , so nervous			1
i was n't this nervous even during @entity76			0
" but some were more relaxed about the potential risks : " everyone should be careful , but i do n't think it 's that big deal			0
it 's not that scary			0
in 2006 during another avian flu , i was in final year of high school and my parents sent me eggs every week			2
i ate a lot , but i 'm still fine now			0
" until march , the virus had only been present in birds , which is why they 've become the focus of the investigation			1
however , 40 % of patients with @entity20 had not come into contact with poultry , according to the @entity95			1
the @entity2 says at this stage there is " limited " evidence of human - to - human transmission			1
three clusters of infection have been identified			0
in each case , they involved family members living in close proximity			0
it was not clear whether relatives had transmitted the virus to each other , or whether they had been exposed to the same initial source of the illness			2
" this becomes a different situation if the virus has human - to - human transmission , " @entity10 said			1
authorities are monitoring more than 1,000 people who have come into close contact with confirmed cases			2
one cluster of infection involved a family where a father and two sons fell ill. the 87 - year - old father died of the virus in march , followed soon after by his younger son			1
it has n't been confirmed whether the son had the illness , according to @entity132 , director of the health emergency center of the @entity95			0
because he had died , further tests were n't possible , @entity132 added , during a press briefing on wednesday			2
the elder son was confirmed to have had the virus but has since recovered			1
he is one of five people who have been discharged from hospital after treatment , according to @entity45			2
so far , one boy is confirmed to have been an asymptomatic carrier of the virus , meaning he tested positive for the illness but did n't display any symptoms			2
the discovery of an asymptomatic carrier is worrying because it could make the spread of the infection more difficult to monitor , experts say			0
the four - year old was part of a sweep of people tested for the illness because they 'd come into close contact with the first reported case in @entity0			1
authorities took throat swabs from a group of people connected to 24 poultry farmers in @entity163 , @entity164 in @entity0 's @entity165 , according to the @entity166			0
the @entity2 reported that of more than 80,000 birds tested in @entity9 , less than 40 had tested positive			1
