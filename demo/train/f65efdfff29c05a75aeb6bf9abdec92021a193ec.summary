as the story of the @entity3 website fiasco unfolds , senior administration aides tell me that the president is " mad , frustrated and angry			1
" mad that his signature legislative achievement is stuck at the gate , frustrated that he 's running out of time to fix it and angry that he 's got a second - term agenda now going nowhere			2
he 's so furious , in fact , that he stepped out of character to vent to an assembled group of top aides , saying he would have delayed the website if he had known it was a mess			2
by thursday , the president was venting publicly			2
" had i been informed , i would n't be going out saying , boy , this is going to be great			0
you know , i 'm accused of a lot of things , but i do n't think i 'm stupid enough to go around saying , this is going to be like shopping on @entity23 or @entity24 , a week before the website opens , if i thought that it was n't going to work			2
" all of which begs the real question : how could he not have known ? it 's a real head - scratcher			2
most powerful man in the world			0
most politically explosive , particularly coming on the heels of the government shutdown			0
consider the context : republicans had just tried to defund @entity3 , and they lost in a heap of public humiliation			1
so the rollout of @entity3 had to be really impressive , because the @entity37 had to be proven wrong			1
and yet , as the dry runs continued to produce red flags -- over and over -- the president remained in his steely cocoon			2
if this were the presidency of @entity47 or @entity48 , the obvious theories would abound : the chief executive is disengaged			0
but since @entity51 is none of the above , what gives ? this much is clear , after speaking with both past and present senior administration officials : no one was really in charge , so no one knew for sure how bad the overall picture was			1
what 's more , and -- perhaps most telling -- no one wanted even to hint to the president that this techno - savvy administration possibly had a website stuck in , say , 1995			1
" people do n't like to tell him bad news , " says an @entity65 staffer			1
" part of it is the no - drama culture			1
the infamous no - drama @entity51 credo : no panic , no drama			1
" no drama is attractive to people , except there are times when people actually should light their hair on fire , " says one former senior administration official			1
" that would have been a very good thing			0
people who have served in top jobs at the @entity88 seem to agree on one thing : a president who wants to get at the truth has to understand the extent of his own isolation			1
and then establish a zone of immunity for truth - tellers			2
that , of course , presumes that the top staff inside the @entity88 knew the full truth			1
and that probably was n't the case			0
again , you ask , how can that be ? answer : the operation resembled the proverbial blind men and the elephant parable : everyone seemed to touch a part of it , but no one could really see the whole picture , or disaster coming right at them			0
" it 's not that someone had an envelope with a note in it saying here comes the second - term crisis , " an ex-top @entity88 staffer says			1
" they were thinking there were some bugs , they would be fixed ; these are smart people			2
" they may be smart , but it appears they had no singular leader			0
they had health care wonks and tech wonks and political wonks and even a presidential wonk , but no put - it - all - together - and - make - sure - it - all - works wonks			0
and maybe , no truth - telling wonks , who would have warned the president that it was a no - no to promise that people could keep their health care policies			1
everyone , it seems , lived in his own silo			0
and that 's where they stayed			0
this is a president , says one admirer , " who likes everyone to stay in his lane			1
" which begs the question : whose lane was it to say the website was n't working ? the probability is that the information filtered to a bunch of different people in a bunch of different lanes			1
sure , the stay - in - your - lane theory of operation is important to a well - run @entity88 , but here 's the flip side if it 's implemented too literally : if you hear something outside your purview that is bad , you may not want to report it higher			1
why ? " everyone thinks if it is n't in my lane , and i talk about it , i 'm being a tattletale , " says one ex-administration official			0
" that would be discouraged as bad behavior in this current @entity88			1
" ( an exception , some point out , ex-chief of staff @entity190 , who " encouraged people to contradict each other			2
" to put it mildly , @entity185 was pro-drama			0
) which brings us to the president , who is n't			0
and if you are n't 100 % sure that the website is a mess -- because no one is actually in charge to tell the @entity88 with any certainty -- what is there to bring to the president ? reports of some bad tests ? bugs ? fixes that are being made ? " nobody is trying to create drama , angst and anxiety , " says an @entity65 official			1
" and it 's hard to go in there and say , ' well , i do n't think this is going to work			0
' " so , the irony			0
all the effort to spare the drama created a huge theatrical mess all of its own			0
the reviews are lousy , and now the unhappy leading man is stewing , centerstage .			0

@entity226 : how could the president not have known of the @entity3 website flaws ?
she says @entity51 *prefers* a " no - drama " @entity88 in which people stay in their lanes
staffers are not encouraged to bring the president bad news , she says
@entity226 : there was no rollout czar for @entity3 ; everyone stayed in their silo
