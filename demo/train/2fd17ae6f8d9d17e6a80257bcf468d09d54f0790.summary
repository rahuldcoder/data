as @entity0 voted on the @entity1 , or @entity1 , in 2010 , one of the bill 's architects , @entity6 economist @entity5 , told a college audience that those pushing the legislation pitched it as a bill that would control spiraling health care costs even though most of the bill was focused on something else and there was no guarantee the bill would actually bend the cost curve			1
in recent days , the past comments of @entity5 -- who in this 2010 speech notes that he " helped write the federal bill " and " was a paid consultant to the @entity26 administration to help develop the technical details as well " -- have been given renewed attention			2
in previously posted but recently noticed speeches , @entity5 discusses how those pushing the bill took part in an " exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the @entity35 voter , " taking advantage of voters ' " stupidity " to create a law that would ultimately be good for them			1
in this fourth video , @entity5 's language is not as stark as in three previous instances , but his suggestion that @entity1 proponents engaged in less - than - honest salesmanship remains			1
" @entity26 's not a stupid man , okay ? " @entity5 said in his remarks at the @entity48 on march 11 , 2010			2
" he knew when he was running for president that quite frankly the @entity35 public does n't actually care that much about the uninsured ...			0
what the @entity35 public cares about is costs			0
and that 's why even though the bill that they made is 90 % health insurance coverage and 10 % about cost control , all you ever hear people talk about is cost control			0
how it 's going to lower the cost of health care , that 's all they talk about			1
why ? because that 's what people want to hear about because a majority of @entity35 care about health care costs			1
" you can watch the speech on the @entity76 website here @entity5 said the measures in the bill that attempt to lower costs constitute a " spaghetti approach " -- throwing everything against the wall to see what sticks			2
and while preferable to the status quo , @entity5 said he could offer no guarantee that any of the measures would work			2
" the only way we 're going to stop our country from being a latter day @entity89 and falling under its own weight is getting control of the growth rate of health care costs , " he said			1
" the problem is we do n't know how			0
" experts " know what the problem is , " he said			0
" our providers are paid enormously high			0
in the 1950s surgeons are middle class guys like professors ... now they live on the @entity103 , the @entity102 , they 're like investment bankers			0
@entity5 said attempts to control costs in a real way were politically untenable			2
" the problem is if we just say , ' look , let 's just cut our spending , ' well , the problem is you 're going to then eat into what the rich guys are getting that they 're liking			0
and that does n't go so well			0
that 's going to be pretty hard politically			0
that 's why no one has a politically feasible way right now to bend the cost curve , it just does n't exist			0
" politicians could suggest capping costs but " you would n't win many elections			0
" the emergence of this videos from an important crafter of the legislation , repeatedly suggesting that " stupid " voters were misled for their own good by @entity1 supporters , is a potential political problem for the president			1
he now faces a @entity0 completely controlled by @entity137 , determined to chip away at if not completely overturn the health care law			1
he also faces another @entity35 @entity140 case on the matter ; @entity140 justices will assuredly be made aware of the @entity5 comments one way or another			2
asked about @entity5 's comments from a 2013 @entity148 panel in which the economist said " a lack of transparency was a huge political advantage for the president ... " in selling the bill to the @entity35 people , @entity145 press secretary @entity144 said " the process associated with writing and passing and implementing the @entity1 has been extraordinarily transparent			1
" @entity144 insisted " it is @entity137 who have been less than forthright and transparent about what their proposed changes to the @entity1 would do in terms of the choices that are available to middle - class families			2
i know there is at least one very prominent @entity137 who campaigned for reelection saying that he would repeal the @entity1 , but yet keep in place the @entity1 marketplace that has operated very successfully in his state			2
" asked about @entity5 's reference to the " stupidity of the @entity35 voter , " @entity144 said , " i disagree vigorously with that assessment			2
" @entity5 declined to comment to @entity176			2
related : third @entity1 architect video emerges on thursday , @entity145 minority leader @entity178 , @entity179 , was asked about @entity5 's remarks			1
" i do n't know who he is , " she said			0
" he did n't help write our bill			0
" a @entity186 story noted that @entity178 in 2009 cited @entity5 's work approvingly			0
the @entity26 administration in recent days has suggested that efforts to bend the cost curve have been working			0
" since president @entity26 signed the @entity1 , there is evidence that we have bent the cost curve when it comes to health care , " the secretary of the @entity192 , @entity193 , said in september			1
" across the board , we have now held down health care price inflation to the lowest rate in 50 years			1
" as @entity202 noted earlier this year in @entity203 , the slowdown in the growth of health care costs is indeed " promising , but analysts remain split over what accounts for the changeâ € ” and , consequently , how long it will be sustained			1
the more pessimistic view is that the lower cost growth is a result of the recession and will inflate again as the economy recovers			0
" a 2013 @entity216 study concluded that the struggling economy was responsible for 77 % of the slowed growth , " that the economy , including factors such as @entity222 growth and inflation , produces a major but delayed effect on the nation 's health spending			0
this effect stretches over a period of six years , meaning that the recession that ended in 2009 will continue to dampen health care spending for several more years and that spending will increase gradually as the economy strengthens			1
" at a press conference in 2010 , president @entity26 told this reporter that " bending the cost curve on health care is hard to do			1
i said at the time , it was n't going to happen tomorrow , it was n't going to happen next year			0
it took us decades to get into a position where our health care costs were going up 6 , 7 , 10 percent a year			1
and so our goal is to slowly bring down those costs , " he said			0
@entity26 added , " as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care , at the margins , that 's going to increase our costs , we knew that			1
we did n't think that we were going to cover 30 million people for free , but that the long - term trend in terms of how much the average family is going to be paying for health insurance is going to be improved as a consequence of health care			1
" the first few @entity5 videos to get any media attention were documented over the course of the last year by @entity261 , an investment adviser who became interested in the origins of the law after the price of insurance for his family doubled .			1

a series of videos featuring statements by an @entity1 architect have incited a furor among *conservatives*
in the videos , @entity6 professor @entity5 suggested @entity1 supporters were *over-emphasizing* the benefits of the health care law .
