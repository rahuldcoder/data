-- @entity1 never met @entity2 and @entity3			1
but he 's been in their shoes			0
just three weeks ago , @entity1 -- like his fellow @entity6 , @entity2 and @entity3 -- was detained in @entity7			1
within a half - hour of his release , he was on a plane leaving the isolated @entity11 nation			0
" on the ride to the airport ... i was hoping they 'd be on the plane as well , " @entity1 said saturday			2
" i got there , and they said i was the only one coming home			0
on saturday , the @entity6 government announced that @entity2 and @entity3 will soon be joining @entity1 on @entity6 soil after being released			1
now in @entity21 , @entity1 wonders why it did n't happen sooner and why he was let go first , despite the fact @entity2 and @entity3 were detained before him			1
" @entity2 and @entity24 should have been released before i was , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" but i 'm glad to hear that they 're on their way home			0
" it 's too early to say what their lives will be like back home			0
@entity3 has been held since april			2
for @entity2 , it has been nearly two years			2
@entity34 , who was released from @entity7 in 2009 after being detained for 140 days , said she wanted to return not just to her home , but to normal			1
" you can imagine that that does n't happen , " @entity36 said			0
" but that 's what , i 'm sure , they want to probably have , ( to ) just come back to regular , mundane days			1
" @entity7 releases @entity2 , @entity3 conditions vary for detainees , but all isolated numerous @entity6 have been detained over the years in @entity7 , though that 's not to say that they 've all had identical experiences			1
of the three released in the past few weeks , it appears @entity2 had it worst			2
the married father of three from @entity49 , @entity50 , moved to @entity51 in 2005			0
a year later , he established " @entity52 , " a @entity51 - based tour company that specialized in tours of @entity7			2
a devout @entity55 , @entity2 was in @entity56 , an area along the northeastern coast of @entity7 , when authorities arrested him in november 2012			2
@entity6 officials confirmed @entity2 's detention the next month			1
the following may , he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for " hostile acts " against the @entity65 nation , and spent time in a labor camp , as well as a hospital			0
and @entity3 got six years of hard labor in september for " acts hostile " to @entity7 , all because he had ripped up his tourist visa and shouted his desire to seek asylum after arriving in the country , the state - run @entity69 reported			2
@entity1 received no such sentence after leaving a @entity75 at a club in northern @entity7 , which he admitted doing			2
while also accused of " perpetrating hostile acts , " and while he -- like @entity2 and @entity3 -- told @entity0 he signed documents admitting his guilt , @entity1 said he did n't spend time in a jail or at a labor camp			1
instead , he spent time in a high - rise hotel and a hospitality center since his detention last spring			0
@entity36 said that being cut off from the world is a major punishment in itself , with or without harsh conditions			0
" being isolated in a foreign country is very difficult , " she said			0
" ( having ) no communication with family members or the outside world ( makes ) it even more hard			0
" former detainee : ' i 'd tell them to keep the faith ' thankfully , that wo n't be a struggle any more for @entity2 and @entity3			1
if past releases are any indication , they 'll soon be hugging and kissing family members back in the @entity6 , then going off to spend time with loved ones			0
" what they really need is people around them ( and in the public who ) can continually give them positive attention , until they are fully recovered from this attention and isolation , " @entity36 said			0
@entity1 said that his transition home was eased by the fact he got his old job back home in @entity21			0
that would seem impossible for @entity2 , who 's been gone longer and whose business was predicated on traveling to @entity7 , as @entity1 fully admits			1
still , he believes that both @entity2 and @entity3 -- if they can survive months detained in @entity7 -- can survive and thrive in their return home as well			1
asked what he would say now to his two fellow @entity6 , @entity1 said , " i 'd tell them to keep the faith			1

@entity2 and @entity3 are the latest @entity6 released from @entity7
@entity7 released @entity1 last month ; he had hoped @entity2 , @entity3 would be with him
@entity1 says he would tell the newly released @entity6 " to keep the faith "
another former @entity7 detainee , @entity34 , says the 2 probably want " mundane days "
