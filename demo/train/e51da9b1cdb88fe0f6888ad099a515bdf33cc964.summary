-- in calmer days , the two @entity2 officers riding in a truck rolling down @entity4 would have been thinking about squirrel hunting or fishing regulations			0
but on tuesday , like everyone else in the mountainous @entity9 country known as @entity10 , they were thinking about fugitive ex-cop @entity11			1
they were on the lookout for a purple @entity14 he might be driving			0
two house cleaners told police earlier in the day that a man they thought was @entity11 tied them up and took their @entity14			1
now police throughout the region , including @entity24 wardens , were keeping an eye out for it , they spotted two school buses for the @entity29 barreling down the other side of the highway			1
driving close behind them was a purple @entity14			0
after days of false leads , going door - to - door , searching frozen mountain passes , the officers thought this might be the break in the case			2
the warden at the wheel hit his brakes , trying to make a u-turn on the narrow pine - lined road			0
an officer radioed in the message that @entity9 law enforcement had been waiting for : we found @entity11			1
and then he was gone again			0
@entity11 apparently realized he 'd been spotted and floored the car , passing the buses and disappearing up the road			1
the @entity24 officers passed the buses and -- thinking the @entity14 was just around the bend -- kept driving			0
in reality , the @entity14 had turned onto another road , eventually crashing			0
sometime later , @entity11 came across @entity58 in a white pickup			1
@entity58 instantly recognized the big man as @entity11			1
" he just came out of the snow at me with his gun at my head , " @entity58 told @entity0 affiliate @entity61			1
" he said , ' i do n't want to hurt you			0
just get out of the car and start walking			2
' " @entity58 started walking			0
by this time , two more @entity24 vehicles , traveling together , had joined the pursuit			0
an officer in the first vehicle noticed @entity58 's white pickup moving fast and erratically down the hill and thought he spotted @entity11 in the truck as it passed			1
but before the first officer had time to warn his colleagues or pick up the radio , @entity11 rolled down his window and pumped multiple pistol rounds into the second @entity24 truck as the two vehicles passed on narrow , twisty @entity82			1
one officer got out of the second vehicle and fired multiple rounds from his ar - 15 rifle at @entity11 's vehicle			1
@entity58 , a ranger at a nearby @entity89 camp , radioed that he heard gunfire			0
" ten to 20 rounds maybe , " he said			0
next , @entity11 ditched @entity58 's truck , ran into the woods and barricaded himself inside a cabin owned by @entity95			1
the home was built , she said , in the 1920s , to give horse - and - buggy travelers between @entity100 and @entity10 a place to spend the night			0
long bursts of gunfire broke through the silence , some of it captured by a reporter working for @entity0 affiliates kcbs and @entity109 , on a cell phone			0
one of them died later at a hospital			0
then the shooting apparently stopped			0
@entity11 found himself surrounded by police , who moved in and began to tear down the walls of the cabin			1
" all right , we 're gon na go forward with the burn ... like we talked about , " said a voice on a local police scanner frequency			1
" we have fire in the front , he might come out the back			0
" a single gunshot was heard from inside the cabin			2
had @entity11 shot himself ? police will not yet say			1
at about 6 p.m. local time , the cabin was engulfed in flames , as an @entity134 television audience watched live images beamed from news choppers			2
the piercing sound of exploding ammunition was heard coming from inside the flaming cabin			2
by 11 p.m. local time , authorities entered the smoldering remnants of the cabin to find charred human remains			2
is the body @entity11 's ? probably			1
but police are taking no chances			2
they are waiting for an autopsy to make an announcement of the final determination			2
@entity0 's @entity152 contributed to this report .			2
