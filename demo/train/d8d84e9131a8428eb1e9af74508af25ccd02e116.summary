@entity0 -- @entity2 will vote in two weeks to approve , or reject , a new constitution -- a potentially pivotal moment for the @entity6 nation that underwent a revolution a year ago and , more recently , has seen its president become the target of fierce protests			1
president @entity11 on saturday announced a december 15 referendum date on what could become the nation 's constitution , shortly it was presented to him by the @entity17 - dominated assembly that crafted it			1
while his supporters cheered the move , there was little indication the vote or anything @entity11 said would placate the opposition			1
" ( @entity11 ) put to referendum a draft constitution that undermines basic freedoms & violates universal values , " said @entity26 , a @entity27 laureate and head of @entity2 's @entity29 , on his @entity31 account			1
" the struggle will continue			0
" the proposed constitution will be published sunday in government newspapers , said @entity39 , head of the 85 - person group that pushed through its 234 articles friday after 21 hours of haggling			1
@entity2 effectively has been without a guiding constitution , as well as a legislature , since the 2011 revolution marked by the ouster of its longtime leader @entity47			1
thousands of the president 's supporters packed streets around @entity52 on saturday , taking part in marches and a massive rally organized by the @entity56 , the @entity57 's political branch that @entity11 once led			1
they carried banners featuring @entity11 's photo , waved the @entity2 flag and chanted their support			1
an even larger rally took place just south of @entity0 in the city of @entity66			0
it involved @entity57 members , fellow @entity17 groups and others including the @entity71 , the @entity72 to protect the @entity73 and the @entity74 of the january 25th youth			0
other @entity77 rallies were held in the northern port city of @entity79 and the central city of @entity81			0
these events aimed to bolster @entity11 after more than a week of protests against him , during which stones flew , demonstrators and police clashed and clouds of tear gas wafted through , among other places , @entity90 in central @entity0			1
that landmark square , which is across the @entity92 from one large @entity77 rally , remained buzzing saturday night with people who have camped out there and marched elsewhere to vent their anger at the president			0
they have called @entity11 a dictator , even worse than @entity47 , for his edict declaring that his past and future decisions are immune from judicial oversight -- new power that the president insists is only temporary			1
they responded to his speech , which was blared over loudspeakers , by chanting , " leave , leave " -- suggesting that , whatever comes of the constitutional referendum , their goal remains removing @entity11 as president			1
@entity11 's controversial edict , issued november 22 , energized the opposition and led them to reoccupy @entity90 , as dissidents did in the winter of 2011			2
seeds of @entity2 's past sown long ago many saw it as an overbearing , undemocratic grab for power that left the president in charge without any checks and balances			1
@entity11 described it as a necessary move to fight judges loyal to @entity47 's regime who were blocking progress in government			2
it engendered sharp opposition within @entity2 's judiciary , with many courts basically shut down as judges and prosecutors went on strike			2
despite the order , the nation 's high administrative court has indicated it will review the proposed constitution -- though it 's not clear , if they rule it invalid , if that will prevent the referendum			1
as part of his edict , @entity11 had also given the constitutional assembly up to six more months to craft the pivotal document			2
but amid the raging discontent , the president spurred the group to speed up its work -- an expedited process that prompted @entity157 , liberal and leftist members of the group to walk - out in protest , with many of them later replaced by @entity164			0
@entity165 , a senior @entity11 adviser , insisted all viewpoints -- including the need to safeguard freedoms when it comes to things like gender and religion -- were taken into account nonetheless			0
opinion : do n't blame @entity57 for @entity11 power grab a quick glimpse at the constitution 's articles show language dealing with individuals ' civil rights , particularly how security forces and the justice system treats them			1
there is wording prohibiting arbitrary arrest and detention and ensuring due process , a sensitive topic in @entity2			0
@entity47 and his loyalists are blamed for jailing and harshly mistreating innocent people in the years before and especially during last year 's uprising			0
one article stipulates no one in jail can be interrogated without a lawyer present , and if detainees do n't have one , the judicial system must appoint one			0
phone conversations , electronic correspondence and other communication could not be taped without a warrant			0
protesters to @entity11 : roll back your decree or leave while many of the articles sound democratic , the fine print indicates otherwise , some human rights advocates say			2
" moving a flawed and contradictory draft to a vote is not the right way to guarantee fundamental rights or to promote respect for the rule of law , " said @entity210 , deputy @entity211 and @entity6 director at @entity214			0
@entity221 , a member of the @entity222 , said he fears the proposed constitution would open the way for a theocracy by moving the country closer to @entity227 law			2
the preamble includes language pertaining to women , saying they are equal to men , but it also accentuates their role as mothers			0
and the @entity235 ' high commissioner for human rights , @entity234 , has urged @entity11 to reconsider the draft , saying a number of measures contained in it are incompatible with international human rights law			0
beyond the details about the constitution itself , some see this month 's vote more generally as a referendum on the government			2
@entity11 took office in june as @entity2 's first popularly elected president , following decades in which @entity47 held vast powers and limited dissent ( including by banning the @entity57 )			1
but @entity11 's recent moves have stirred suspicions that he and his @entity17 allies are intent on amassing powers at the expense of others			0
opinion : a new @entity2 must learn political compromise @entity1 's @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report .			0

new : president 's supporters cheer proposed constitution at rallies in @entity0 , elsewhere
new : but an opposition leader rips the document and says " the struggle will continue "
@entity2 can vote in a referendum on the proposed constitution on december 15
protesters have criticized @entity11 for what they call an undemocratic power grab
