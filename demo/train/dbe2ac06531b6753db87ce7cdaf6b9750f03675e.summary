-- lawyers for the mother of a 15 - year - old girl suing " the @entity4 " lambasted the show 's producers tuesday as " reckless " for letting her child appear as a self - described sex addict			1
the girl 's mother , @entity11 , filed a lawsuit earlier this month in @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
her suit contends the show never got valid written consent and an employment certificate , which must be obtained in @entity16 before a minor can be " employed as a performer in a television production ... [ and ] the minor will not be used for pornographic purposes			2
" @entity11 's lawyers said tuesday the consent form that " the @entity4 " received was clearly forged by the daughter , @entity27			1
after being contacted by @entity30 , the show 's staff called her cell phone and arranged for her to fly from @entity15 to @entity32 and appear on the now - defunct program			1
its last air date was may 28			0
" you had an infatuated child who would do anything , " attorney @entity36 told @entity41 's @entity40 , explaining that the teenager doctored the consent form because she admired and wanted to meet @entity44 , the longtime model and tv personality			1
the lawsuit , which seeks $ 3 million , contends that " the @entity4 " used @entity30 's appearance to further its main goal of boosting ratings and , thus , bringing in advertising revenue			1
on the show , which aired in october 2009 , @entity30 claimed she lost her virginity at 9 and had gotten pregnant three times -- claims that she now says were n't true , according to her lawyers			2
" it 's like i 'm trapped in a dark place with no light shining down , like i 'm a prisoner , " @entity30 said on the tv show			2
" i know that i need help for this			0
... i know it for a fact , " she added			0
attorney @entity65 said that by publicizing @entity30 's alleged struggles with sex addiction , the program publicly exploited a teenage girl who confessed to having a serious problem			1
and it did so , she claims , without properly finding out whether the minor had her parent 's permission to appear			0
" it 's dangerous , " said @entity76 , who is representing @entity11 with @entity36			1
" if you thought she had that kind of problem , why would you put her on television ? " the defendants have not answered the complaint			0
no court date has been set			0
@entity86 , senior vice president of worldwide communications for @entity88 , declined to comment last week to @entity0			0
@entity89 , one of the defendants in @entity11 's lawsuit , is a division of @entity93 , which is the parent company of @entity0			2
