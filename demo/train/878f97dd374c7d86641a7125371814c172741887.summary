-- leading @entity1 in a political partnership with @entity3 , the country 's prime minister , would be " very good			1
" that 's the view of his biggest rival in this weekend 's presidential elections , @entity9			1
the comment might seem unusual for a politician , but it reflects @entity1 's admiration for @entity3			1
@entity9 , speaking on @entity1 television , continued in the same vein , noting he liked @entity3 's leadership and admired his work as prime minister			1
according to the polls , more than half of @entity1 agrees			1
@entity3 has won a record three terms as prime minister and polls show he 's likely to win sunday 's presidential elections			1
this is because @entity3 has led the country with actions , not words			1
@entity3 has always been known by what he has achieved			2
his oratory is impressive , but it 's not his winning point			0
before @entity3 was elected mayor of @entity32 in 1994 , there were frequent water cuts , garbage piled through the streets and air pollution			2
he solved the problems in just three years			0
@entity3 then co-established his own party , the @entity38 , or @entity38 , and ran in the general elections			1
he was known colloquially as the saver of @entity32 and in 2002 , he was voted in as prime minister , with 34 % of the vote			0
at the time @entity1 was facing its biggest economic crisis			2
inflation rate ran above 30 % and overnight interest rates had hit 63 %			0
under @entity3 , inflation declined to single digits and @entity48 tripled			2
his commitment to doing business with emerging markets such as @entity52 and @entity53 meant the country secured nearly $ 130 billion in foreign investment , compared to $ 15 billion during the previous 80 years			2
visitor numbers soared , from 16 million in 2003 to 35 million in 2013			0
the economic upturn helped @entity1 fund schools , hospitals , highways , railways , airways and universities			2
and , looking at the figures , it seems naive to question how @entity3 continues to dominate @entity1 politics			1
the recipe is simple : he is beneficial for the people , and they want him as their leader			0
further , when compared to the @entity38 , the opposition party @entity70 looks incompetent			0
but @entity72 's success is not just economic			0
@entity1 has a long way to go towards full democracy , but @entity3 has tackled three significant problems			1
firstly he has , for example , allowed the army to do its one and only job : be an army			0
secondly , he has backed the " solution process , " designed to bring peace with the @entity83 region			0
the " @entity85 " has cost more than 30,000 lives and up to $ 450 billion			0
thirdly , @entity3 has also modernized @entity1 society by lifting the headscarf ban in universities and public , liberating religious women			1
@entity3 , in a first for the country , also expressed condolences to the @entity93 people for the massacre in 1915 , during @entity95			1
further , he initiated reforms that empowered non-muslim communities , such as the 2008 law on foundations that enabled property worth $ 2.5 billion , previously occupied unjustly by the state , to be returned to minorities			0
it wo n't be a surprise if @entity3 is elected as president			1
under his leadership , democratic and economic improvements will continue			0
it is good now -- and it will hopefully get better			0
