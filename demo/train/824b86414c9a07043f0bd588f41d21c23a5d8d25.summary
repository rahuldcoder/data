-- the @entity2 federal government has approved a plan to dump 3 million cubic meters of dredge spoil in the @entity5			1
the dredged material will come from the proposed expansion of the coal port at @entity9 , south of @entity10 on the @entity12 coast			1
final approval came from the @entity14 , and is subject to " strict conditions			1
" the proposal , while controversial and opposed by environmental groups including @entity18 , had already been approved by federal environment minister @entity19 last month			1
@entity21 's government has come under fire for a raft of environmental decisions lately , including an election pledge to rescind expansion of @entity29 's @entity28 - listed forest reserve which has united environmental campaigners and the forestry industry , who see the plan as unworkable and damaging in the long term			1
the reef is the largest living structure on the planet , and is a hugely diverse ecosystem stretching 2,300 kilometers along the @entity12 coast			0
the @entity14 is 345,000 square kilometers in size and home to thousands of species of coral , fish , molluscs , jellyfish , sharks and whales			1
a statement released by the @entity14 said the proposal was in line with directives to limit development of ports on the coast to existing facilities			2
" as a deepwater port that has been in operation for nearly 30 years , @entity9 is better placed than other ports along the @entity5 coastline to undertake expansion as the capital and maintenance dredging required will be significantly less than what would be required in other areas , " said dr @entity55 , authority chairman			2
" it 's important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand , silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds			0
" the @entity74 's general manager for @entity75 , @entity73 echoes the statement , saying that the environmental safeguards -- 47 in total -- insisted upon by the @entity74 would protect the reef and seagrasses , along with the social and heritage uses of the marine park			0
" by granting this permit application with rigorous safeguards , we believe we are able to provide certainty to both the community and the proponent while seeking to ensure transparent and best practice environmental management of the project , " he said			0
the plan has attracted widespread criticism and @entity95 spokesman @entity94 said the approval from the marine park authority marked a " sad day for the reef and anyone who cares about its future			0
" the @entity5 was designated a @entity28 by @entity101 in 1981 and environmental group @entity18 warned that the move to allow dumping in the park may lead to that organization listing the site as " in danger " this year			0
" this go - ahead for dumping is one more body blow for the @entity113 which further threatens marine life , its @entity28 status and @entity2 's tourism and fishing industries , " @entity108 campaigner @entity107 said on the group 's website			0
" @entity118 lighting the reef 's destruction makes a mockery of the @entity74 's charter which obliges it to protect the @entity14 and the @entity28			2
