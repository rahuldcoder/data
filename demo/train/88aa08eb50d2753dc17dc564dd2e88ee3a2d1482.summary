-- @entity2 's telecommunications regulator , @entity1 , fined private television broadcaster @entity3 tuesday 7.5 % of its gross income for alleged violations of the country 's media responsibility laws , marking the latest salvo in the long - running feud between the broadcaster and the government			1
@entity3 said it would appeal the fine of 9,300,000 bolivares fuertes ( $ 2.2 million ) , which the station said risked bankrupting it			1
@entity1 's director , @entity17 , however , said during a news conference that the fine could not be appealed			2
@entity3 is @entity2 's last remaining television broadcaster that is openly critical of president @entity21			1
the fine stems from @entity3 's coverage of a standoff at the @entity25 prison in june and july			1
the station violated a law that prohibits stirring anxiety in the public and instigating intolerance for political reasons , @entity17 said			1
these are violations under a media responsibility law passed in december			2
the goal of the law is to establish " social responsibility " in those who provide television , radio and internet service			0
the law affects all text , images , sound or context sent or received in @entity2			0
@entity17 said the sanction does not seek to suspend the transmission of @entity3 , a 24 - hour news station			1
but @entity49 , a vice president of the network , said paying that sum could spell the end of its broadcast			2
" this fine represents the bankruptcy of @entity3 , " she said			1
the government official said @entity3 had " a couple of days " to pay the fine			1
@entity3 defended its coverage of the prison standoff , which started with a riot that killed at least 22 people and turned into a nearly monthlong standoff between prisoners and national guard troops			2
the broadcaster said it was denied access at the scene and completed its reporting fairly and in a balanced way given its limitations			0
@entity72 , a member of the freedom of expression committee of the @entity75 , likened @entity21 to a dictator in an interview with @entity3 and said the fine was a roundabout way to shutter the station			1
" the political objective is to shut down all the voices who are critical or independent , " he said			0
@entity21 and his top leadership did not immediately comment on the move			0
the broadcaster is the last remaining tv network that carries an @entity89 line , since the president refused to renew the license of another opposition station , @entity92 , allegedly over telecommunication regulation violations			2
the station had to go off public airwaves and transmit solely on cable			0
over the years , the government has launched various investigations into @entity3 -- for everything from reporting about an earthquake before an official report had been issued , to failing to pay about $ 2.3 million in taxes			1
station officials have said the charges are politically motivated			0
last year , the government secured a 25.8 % interest in the broadcaster when it took over two companies , which owned a 20 % and 5.8 % stake in @entity3 , respectively			1
the government 's interest was sufficient to name a representative to the broadcaster 's board , @entity21 said then			2
his government has also gone after the owner of @entity3 , @entity3 , who is wanted in @entity2 for allegedly illegally storing vehicles at his @entity121 home with the intent to sell them for a profit			1
the tv magnate , who is living in exile , has said he is being persecuted for political purposes and that the charges are trumped up			0
his son is also wanted			0
international groups accuse @entity21 of using a friendly judiciary to silence critics and the press			0
the president , however , maintains there is robust @entity137 in @entity2			0
the country 's constitution protects freedom of expression , but those who exercise it will be responsible for that content , the government has argued .			0

new : the *penalty* is the latest salvo in long - running *dispute* between @entity3 and the government
the broadcaster is fined 7.5 % of its gross income for violating the law
the government accuses the network of inciting anxiety in the public
the $ 2.2 million fine could mean the end of @entity3
