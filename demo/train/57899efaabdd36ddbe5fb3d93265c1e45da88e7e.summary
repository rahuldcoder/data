@entity0 -- it 's monday , mid-morning as we drive east down rain - slicked roads			1
there are no cars , no trucks , and no people			2
@entity0 's government demanded a shutdown and its citizens are listening			1
the @entity13 nation crippled by @entity14 is responding to the outbreak through a day of prayer and reflection			1
but that gives little comfort to us			0
@entity14 is a disease that spreads fear faster than it infects			1
and the emptiness makes us uneasy			0
we 're headed to @entity24 or @entity24 's treatment facility in @entity26 , a border community in the middle of the @entity29 triangle , linking the country with @entity31 and @entity32			1
simply put , it 's the epicenter of this unprecedented epidemic			2
already more than 1,700 people have been infected across the three countries and now @entity37 and possibly more			1
@entity14 can kill up to 90 % of those infected and more than 930 people have already died in this epidemic , dwarfing all previous @entity14 outbreaks			1
the @entity41 has just declared it a public health emergency			0
but as we sit down with @entity24 's emergency coordinator at their makeshift headquarters , we realize , months since the first infection , no one yet truly knows the outbreak 's full scope			1
" we are too late			0
in an @entity14 outbreak you need to be a step ahead			1
we are two steps behind , " says @entity53			0
what @entity24 needs , says @entity53 , is n't more doctors -- they have those			1
what 's needed are more experts out in the communities , to trace the disease and help train local health workers , she says			1
ebola virus : 9 things to know about the killer disease @entity53 , a veteran responder to outbreaks , much of her staff 's time is focused educating workers on how to respond safely to a virus that can infect with just one drop of bodily fluid			1
if mistakes are made , the results are deadly			0
the @entity24 's ebola case management center in @entity26 is tightly sealed			1
we clumsily balance on one leg and then the other as a technician sprays the soles of our shoes with chlorine			0
once inside , orange netting separates the low - risk zone from the high - risk areas			0
it 's just a few feet , but we 're told that 's more than enough			2
while @entity14 is highly infectious , it is n't particularly contagious , as it 's only spread by direct contact with bodily fluids -- not through the air			1
still , we watch the doctors take incredible care as they suit - up in layer after layer of protective gear			0
dr. @entity97 and others will enter the high - risk zone several times a day			0
the heat without the suits is uncomfortable			0
with the suits it 's nearly unbearable			2
the medical staff can only go in an hour at a time , after that the sweat in their facemasks becomes a risk			0
the work is intense , the stress levels are incredibly high , and there 's little doctors can do here except treat the symptoms of @entity14			1
there is no confirmed cure for the virus			0
9 questions about this new @entity14 drug still @entity97 says for him there was no question that he needed to be here			2
" at the moment , in @entity26 , if @entity24 was n't here , there would be nothing			2
that 's good enough reason for me			2
" the district 's population is nearly 500,000 with just four ambulances			1
containing the virus means isolating each patient			0
for now , that is n't happening -- the center has just 80 beds			1
" it is really is frustrating for us because we do n't have the capacity to go everywhere , " says @entity53			0
luckily @entity139 came to them			0
her husband and son died of the disease and she and her daughter continue to battle in the high - risk zone			2
to talk to her , we must stand a few feet away , the orange netting , separating us			0
we know the protocols protect us , but they isolate her			0
what 's the risk of catching @entity14 on a plane ? when they are n't treating patients , doctors here spend time in the low - risk zone , talking with their masks off , so that patients can see their faces			1
but , there 's no way around the isolation that @entity139 and others here feel			2
doctors here say they know how to contain @entity14			2
they just need more resources			0
it 's clear talking to patients like @entity170 , the will to beat @entity14 is here too			1
" we are feeling much better , we are strong and we are going to fight			0

an @entity14 outbreak in @entity13 has infected more than 1,700 people
@entity1 's @entity177 and @entity178 traveled to an ebola treatment center in @entity0
@entity24 workers there say they need more experts in the community tracing the disease
their center is based in a district with a population of 500,000 , and they have just 80 beds
