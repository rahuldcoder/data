-- creating the next @entity1 or @entity2 may be the dream of many tech entrepreneurs , but it 's only a small band that ever get to make it happen			2
for @entity9 , giving a fighting chance to that next big idea has become a business in its own right			2
as the co-founder of startup accelerator @entity14 , she knows a thing or two about what makes a successful tech company			1
her out - of - the - box idea was to provide small amounts of funding to lots of startups at once			1
" a lot of times when start - ups get started , there 's this kernel of an idea			1
it 's not very exciting , all your friends and family are making fun of it , " she said			0
established in 2005 , @entity14 focuses on providing a small amount of funding , food , work space and expertise to up - and - coming entrepreneurs			1
in return , @entity14 obtains a 7 % stake in each company once it is launched			1
" @entity14 provides funding for startups at the very earliest stages , " @entity46 said			1
" we have an application process twice a year and we fund startups in batches			2
so we 'll fund 80 startups at once over a three - month period			1
" $ 120,000 in funds the company gives startups $ 120,000 and then helps them incorporate as a business			1
" we then help them with their idea , help them launch and help them get press and then at the end of the three months we 'll host a demo day and that is when the startups present to about 500 of the country 's top investors to get follow - up funding , " says @entity46			1
since its inception , @entity46 has funded more than 700 startups and 12 non-profits			2
some of them are now among the best known online companies in the world including @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
" when you first get started on an idea , you do n't want millions of dollars in funding , " explained @entity46			0
" you would n't know what to do with it			0
you just want a little bit of money to see if your idea works and then take it from there			0
" she now has a keen eye for the " next big thing " and recognizes the role they will play in shaping the future of business			0
cohesive team @entity102 to the success of a startup , she said , is a cohesive founding team			0
" have the founders known each other for years ? did they go to school together , did they work together for five years ? one of the biggest reasons startups fail early on is because the co-founders do n't get along			1
" i love startups because anyone can start one if they have a computer and an internet connection			2
" you can be any age , you can do it from home			0
and it 's all about seeing if an idea can work and to me that 's just so exciting			0
and that 's what gets me up every morning			0
" " it does n't matter where you went to college			0
it does n't matter who you know			0
we are just looking for a great idea			0
