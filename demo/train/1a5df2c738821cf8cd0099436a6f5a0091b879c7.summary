-- if you heard there was a weapon proven to prevent most crimes before they happen , would you run out and buy it ? world - renowned security expert @entity6 says this weapon exists , but you already have it			1
he calls it " the gift of fear			1
" one chapter in @entity6 's book " @entity13 " has stuck with @entity14 since she first read it			1
the story of a woman named @entity17 begins with a simple warning sign			1
a man offers to help carry her groceries into her apartment -- and instantly , @entity17 does n't like the sound of his voice			1
@entity17 goes against her gut and lets him help her -- and in doing so , she lets a rapist into her home			1
" we get a signal prior to violence , " @entity6 says			1
" there are preincident indicators			1
things that happen before violence occurs			1
" @entity6 says that unlike any other living creature , humans will sense danger yet still walk right into it			1
" you 're in a hallway waiting for an elevator late at night			1
elevator door opens , and there 's a guy inside , and he makes you afraid			1
you do n't know why , you do n't know what it is			1
some memory of this building -- whatever it may be			1
and many women will stand there and look at that guy and say , ' oh , i do n't want to think like that			1
i do n't want to be the kind of person who lets the door close in his face			1
i 've got to be nice			1
i do n't want him to think i 'm not nice			1
' and so human beings will get into a steel soundproof chamber with someone they 're afraid of , and there 's not another animal in nature that would even consider it			1
" for weeks , @entity72 had a funny feeling that something odd was going on in her apartment			1
" my gut started feeling like something just was n't right , " she says			1
" i would come home , and there would be just weird lights on in my house -- lights that i did n't even remember turning on in the first place			2
" then one day , @entity72 noticed a @entity85 delivery box where it should n't be			2
" i 'm like , ' how did this brand of box get on my back balcony ? ' " @entity72 began to feel uneasy -- but continued to brush it off			1
" i would just come home , you know , and almost feel nauseous , " she says			2
" i kept trying to justify it saying , ' okay , it is in my head			2
' " @entity72 's funny feeling eventually escalated into full - fledged panic attacks , which @entity6 says were her intuition 's way of telling her that something was wrong			1
" and intuition records everything			2
so when she started getting panics attacks , her intuition is saying , basically , ' you 're not going to listen ? okay , i 'll ramp it up			2
i 'll give you panic attacks			2
you want sleepless nights ? i 'll give you sleepless nights			2
' " @entity72 eventually did listen to her intuition , starting with a simple test			2
" i dropped a tank top behind the door as i was leaving for work , thinking that when i come home that night , i 'm going to peek my head around the corner			2
if [ the tank top ] had been pushed to the side , it would have been obvious that the door was opened			2
" when @entity72 got home , she says the tank top had moved			2
caught on camera the next day , @entity72 says she set up a hidden camera to try and find out what was going on in her apartment			2
once she came home , @entity72 says she plugged the camcorder into her laptop			2
" and the first thing i see is this man 's head peeking around the corner into my house , " she says			2
" what i felt at that point was just complete terror			2
i 'm sitting there watching this video -- this story unfold -- and this person comes in my house , is looking around , going through my things , looking through my laundry , holding up my lingerie			2
" as @entity72 continues to watch in horror , the intruder undresses himself and puts her lingerie on			0
" so this person is in my clothes , proceeds to start pleasuring himself -- just very , very graphic things happening right there in my house with my belongings			0
and he finishes up , takes off my clothes -- and puts them exactly back as i had left them -- puts his clothes back on , checks to make sure nobody 's outside the door and leaves			0
" after watching the tape , @entity72 says she ran around her apartment , screaming hysterically			0
she says she had never seen the man in the tape before			0
" initially , i took my cell phone , called my boyfriend at the time , screaming hysterically			0
all i could say was , ' he 's in my house			0
he 's in my house			0
' even picking up the phone , dialing , was difficult			0
" two weeks later , police found the man -- 39 - year - old @entity166 , a computer consultant with a young son and a wife at the time			0
police were unable to charge @entity166 with anything more than trespassing ... until he came back to @entity72 's apartment to steal her camera			0
police were able to charge @entity166 with burglary , and he was sentenced to eight years in prison			0
dangerous behavior when @entity72 found the @entity85 box on her balcony , @entity6 says this was a warning sign			1
@entity6 applauds @entity72 for listening to her intuition and says that quieting her fear could have caused the situation to escalate			1
" he 's already into behavior of wanting to get caught , " he says			0
" you do n't come back again and again and again and not want to get caught			0
" @entity6 says like @entity72 , the intruder 's intuition was probably trying to tell him something too			1
" offenders as well can see what 's happening in their lives			0
and talk about not listening to it -- he 's in someone 's apartment doing something sexual with their clothes on -- that 's something to listen to			0
" because the intruder had a job and a family , @entity6 says his behavior was not only reckless , but dangerous as well			1
" when people do listen , they can stop what 's almost fate , " @entity6 says			1
" there 's a great line that @entity213 said			0
he said , ' what we do not make conscious emerges later as fate			0
' if he made it conscious , if he could talk to someone about it , if he could tell someone , he could get better also			0
but he did n't , and it does mean escalation			0
if she discovered him , that 's dangerous			0
if he came in when she was there , that 's dangerous			0
" your feelings are warnings @entity231 , who says she endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of her husband , appeared on " @entity0 " after leaving her husband			0
unfortunately , her battle did n't end there -- two months after she left him , @entity231 's ex-husband abducted her at gunpoint and raped her			0
after the show , @entity14 spoke with @entity231 again to ask if her she had sensed any warning signs the night she was abducted			0
" as i was coming home from work , it was just a very eerie , strange feeling as i drove up , " @entity231 says			1
" it was darker than normal in my driveway , and there was a trash can sitting where i normally park right in the middle			0
" i thought , ' hmm , this is strange			0
' because my mother lives with me , and she 'll turn on the lights when it gets dark			0
it did give me a little eerie feeling -- the hairs on the back of your neck kind of stand up			1
but still , i did n't listen to my instincts			0
" @entity6 says that " eerie feeling " is exactly what he wants women to pay attention to			1
" we 're trying to analyze the warning signs , " he says			0
" and what i really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign			1
all the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling			1
why it was this , why it was that			0
the feeling itself is the warning sign			1
