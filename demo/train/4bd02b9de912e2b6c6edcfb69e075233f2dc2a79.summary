@entity0 was playing professional basketball in @entity2 last year , working toward achieving his lifelong dream of playing in the @entity4 , when something strange happened at the end of practice			1
" i 'm running sprints , just normal sprints , and i run and touch the baseline , go back and my foot gives out , " said @entity0 , now 23			1
" i just thought i slipped or something like that			2
but i noticed my foot started getting numb and it just got progressively worse			2
" by the time @entity0 showed up to practice the next morning , he had lost feeling in his right leg			1
before practice was over , the numbness had spread to the entire right side of his body			2
but doctors initially said nothing was wrong and told him to take it easy			0
" they told me just to rest for a day and see how it felt in the morning , " he remembered			2
" when i went back ... it had gotten worse			0
it was harder for me to walk , it had spread to my left foot and it just became , basically taking over my body -- it was crazy			0
" cancer patient runs 50 marathons in 50 states eventually @entity0 found a specialist and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis , a debilitating disease that involves the immune system attacking the central nervous system			1
he had never heard of it before			0
" a few of my teammates knew exactly what it was , but i was n't aware , " he said			0
fortunately , @entity0 was in peak physical condition at the time of his diagnosis , something he credits for how well he 's doing today			1
" good physical condition , eating right , getting the proper rest , that all plays a major role , " he explained			0
" obviously you have to change a few things , you ca n't be going out all the time			0
... but definitely my conditioning and being an athlete has definitely , definitely played a major role			0
" not only did @entity0 return to the court less than three months after being diagnosed , he made history two weeks ago when he signed a 10 - day contract with the @entity57			1
with the stroke of a pen , @entity0 became the first person with @entity61 to play in the @entity4			1
the @entity57 did not re-sign @entity0 when the 10 - day contract expired			1
' @entity63 ' favorite : i was a walking target meanwhile , he said , " i 'm doing pretty well			0
i have to do an iv injection once every month , that takes about a two - hour process , " he said			2
still , he said , " it 's all been a blessing			1
" asked what he would tell other patients with @entity61 , @entity0 did n't hesitate : " do n't be afraid to step out and do what you want to do , " he said			1
" do n't believe it 's a crippling disease that will just handle you the rest of your life			2
yeah , there may be limitations , but you can still live your life			0
and i just wear that sign on my chest proudly , and you know , i 'm a part of the @entity61 society			0
