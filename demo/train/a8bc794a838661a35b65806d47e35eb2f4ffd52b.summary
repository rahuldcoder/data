-- earlier this year , sen. @entity1 , @entity3 - @entity2 , and @entity5 minority leader @entity4 , @entity6 , expressed support for raising taxes only on households earning $ 1 million or more , a higher threshold than the $ 250,000 dividing line backed by president @entity12			1
eventually , @entity1 and @entity4 declared their support for the president 's position			1
but the $ 1 million proposal might serve as the basis for a bipartisan agreement			2
a number of @entity21 , led by sen. @entity22 , @entity23 , have called for raising tax revenue by capping deductions at $ 50,000 , a proposal that would leave virtually all middle - income households untouched while substantially raising average tax rates on households in the top 2 % of the income distribution			1
a deduction cap is expected to raise roughly $ 800 billion in revenue above current policy , which is only half of the $ 1.6 trillion the @entity12 administration hopes to raise from high - earners			1
it is , however , an amount that many congressional republicans appear to have deemed acceptable			0
politics : the road to fiscal cliff paved with good intentions one of the central problems with a deduction cap , however , is that it is likely to be opposed by politically influential charitable organizations , which recognize that it will greatly undermine the incentive for high earners to make large charitable donations			0
moreover , president @entity12 has insisted that tax rates on high earners will have to increase , though he has not made an explicit commitment to the @entity55 - era statutory top rate of 39.6 % ( which compares to today 's top rate of 35 % )			1
so , is there a way out of this impasse ? rep. @entity60 , @entity61 , along with @entity62			0
@entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , and @entity67 , @entity68 , have called on congressional @entity21 to back legislation that would extend all the @entity71 - era tax cuts except for the high - income rate reductions , which would be allowed to expire			0
this remains a minority view among congressional @entity21 , but it may well gain support in light of the popularity of allowing the high - income rate reductions to expire			0
another possibility is that congressional republicans will embrace the @entity82 proposal			0
that is , rather than embrace expiration for the high - income rate reductions for households earning $ 250,000 or more , they would accept it for households earning $ 1 million or more			1
this would shield a large , politically influential constituency of affluent households , a disproportionately large share of whom live in high - cost metropolitan areas in blue states , while allowing @entity96 and @entity21 to take a politically popular stand			0
opinion : a tax we could learn to love to raise somewhat more revenue , this threshold could be set at $ 500,000 or $ 410,000 , the latter of which would more precisely target the top 1 % of households by annual income			1
rather than set the tax rate for this new top bracket at 39.6 % , @entity108 could set a rate of 36 % or 37 % , a face - saving gesture that would contribute to an appearance of moderation			0
back in 2007 , @entity115 , a tax economist at the right - of - center @entity117 , offered a detailed explanation of why increasing taxes on high - income households alone is unlikely to raise enough revenue to reach ambitious deficit reduction goals			2
at the time , he estimated that raising $ 1 trillion in additional revenue relative to the @entity71 - era tax code from households earning $ 1 million or more ( $ 500,000 for singles ) would require raising the tax rate from 35 % to 57 %			2
if the goal of a millionaire 's tax bracket is not to raise revenue in the most efficient manner but rather to make a political point , as seems at least somewhat plausible , it is easy to imagine it as the basis of a political compromise			2
the @entity12 administration is eager to secure more fiscal stimulus for the coming year in light of sluggish global economic growth			1
so a tax compromise that raises relatively little revenue is arguably desirable , at least in the short term , as it would help forestall an economic contraction			0
homes , cars , jobs : @entity149 already making big decisions over fiscal cliff if some small number of @entity21 senators from swing states are willing to cross the aisle to back a millionaire 's tax bracket , president @entity12 will be able to claim he has a bipartisan consensus in favor of his broad approach to resolving the fiscal cliff			1
this in turn will make it very difficult for @entity164 to resist			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			2

earlier this year sen. @entity1 , rep. @entity4 proposed raising taxes on millionaires
@entity168 says their idea of a higher threshold than @entity12 's $ 250,000 could work
@entity168 : it would **n't** raise as much money , but would be more politically *palatable*
he says another plus is that it would **n't** risk as much of an economic *slowdown*
