@entity0 , the international chemical weapons watchdog helping to eliminate the @entity5 army 's stockpiles of poison gas , recognizes the dangers and difficulties that the body faces			1
a team from the @entity9 and the @entity14 has been in @entity5 since october 1 , and oversaw the first destruction of chemical weapons equipment this week			1
on sunday , @entity5 personnel used " cutting torches and angle grinders to destroy or disable a range of items , " the @entity9 said			1
" this included missile warheads , aerial bombs and mixing and filling equipment			0
" given the danger the inspectors face , @entity14 secretary general @entity25 this week described the joint @entity9 - @entity14 mission in @entity5 as " an operation the likes of which , quite simply , have never been tried before			1
" the joint mission is tasked with eliminating all chemical weapons in the country by midyear 2014			1
" these developments present a constructive beginning for what will nonetheless be a long and difficult process , " @entity9 director - general @entity35 said			1
mission impossible ? securing @entity5 's chemical weapons would n't be easy there are many more sites to inspect and the @entity9 experts face significant dangers in working in a country riven by a protracted civil war			1
the @entity14 resolution that authorized the mission capped a month of dramatic diplomacy between the @entity51 and @entity52			1
that deal averted an @entity51 military strike over allegations the @entity5 government used sarin nerve gas in an august 21 attack on a @entity60 suburb			2
@entity51 officials said at least 1,400 people died in the attack			0
@entity5 denied responsibility , blaming rebel forces			2
the @entity65 tweeted that the prize was awarded not because of @entity5 " but because of its long standing work			2
" however , in a statement it said that recent events had underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons			2
it also pointed the finger at certain states for failing to observe an april 2012 deadline to destroy their chemical weapons			1
" this applies especially to the @entity51 and @entity52 , " it added			0
the need to rid the world of chemical weapons was underlined by events in @entity83 , said @entity1 's @entity84			1
former dictator @entity85 tried over many years to destroy his stocks under the terms of an international treaty , but after his removal from power in 2011 and the ensuring turmoil , @entity83 's remaining weapons spread throughout the region			2
arms treaty the @entity9 , based in @entity95 , in the @entity96 , is the implementing body for the @entity98 , an international arms control treaty			1
the @entity98 entered into force in april 1997 , at which point 87 states had ratified it -- and the work of the @entity9 to implement its provisions began at that point			1
according to the treaty 's wording , signatories are " determined for the sake of all mankind , to exclude completely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons , through the implementation of the provisions of this convention			1
" sixteen years later , more than 100 additional states have ratified the treaty			0
in september , @entity5 became the latest nation to ask to join the convention			2
it is due to enter into force in @entity5 on october 14 , when it will become the 190th member state			2
aside from its work on disarmament , the @entity9 aims to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons through the inspection of chemical production facilities and monitoring of transfers of toxic chemicals and their precursors			1
the @entity9 's experts have monitored the cataloguing and destruction of chemical weapons in countries ranging from the @entity51 and @entity52 to @entity83			1
they have also worked in @entity140 , which was the first time its inspectors were sent into a live battlefield			0
" we try to get as much information as we can about what we are doing , " @entity144 , @entity9 's head of inspector training , recently told @entity1 , during an exclusive visit to the organization 's lab and staging facility in the @entity96			2
" we want to know what the target site looks like ; we want to know what we are after			0
the information we get is what 's going to inform the inspectors about the kind of protective equipment they are going to wear			0
" @entity144 showed @entity1 around the @entity9 's warehouse and explained the inspectors ' rules of operations			2
once they have located the site of a possible chemical weapons attack , the inspectors use special electronic detectors to give them an initial readout of the type of chemicals they might be facing , and in what concentration			1
two different machines , using different technologies , are used to increase confidence in the result			0
in addition to chemical experts , the inspection team also includes munitions experts			0
that 's because they may be dealing with unexploded ordnance			0
in addition , shell remnants often contain traces of the chemical residue inspectors are looking for			0
@entity144 said inspectors rarely find chemical agents in their pure form , but , crucially , they can detect residues even if only fine traces are left			0
" the holy grail for environmental sampling is the pure agent , the agent itself			0
[ but ] that might not be practical ; we do not expect to find agent by the time we arrive			0
so we need to look for secondary evidence			0
that could be munitions fragments , or the delivery device itself , or whatever they used to deliver the agent			0
munitions fragments can inform us of many things ; they can still hold agent , if there is some liquid left			0
" identifying the munitions and the delivery device can also assist the investigative process , by providing clues about who might have been behind the attack			0
reactions the @entity215 , the executive arm of the @entity216 , which won the peace prize last year , tweeted its backing , saying : " congratulations @ @entity9 ! # @entity219 is a powerful recognition of your important role in curbing the use of chemical weapons			1
" and @entity227 's secretary general @entity226 sent his support : " congratulations to @ @entity9 for winning # @entity229 ! @entity9 doing difficult but essential work in eliminating # wmd # @entity231 in # @entity5 " some took exception to the award though			1
@entity236 , deputy director of @entity237 for @entity239 / @entity238 tweeted : " i would have thought 2013 would have been a year for soul searching at @entity9 not accolades			2
" and @entity242 , deputy editor of @entity244 magazine , made a dig at the expense of @entity51 president @entity247 , a previous @entity8 laureate : " @entity9 owes this prize to the use of chemical weapons and the 2009 winner 's subsequent threat to bomb @entity5			1
" @entity252 , a @entity253 human rights activist who won the 2011 @entity8 , described how the award inspired her battle against injustice			1
" the peace prize meant so much for me and my @entity253 people and the youth of the @entity262 who were fighting dictatorship and corruption , " she wrote in an email to @entity1 before the announcement was made			0
" there will be no deviation or turning back no matter how much violence and suppressions we face and no matter how many bullets and bombs are directed towards the chest of peaceful activists who are full of love and peace			0
no matter who wins the prize this year , i believe that both that person and his organization are worthy of respect and our trust			0
the @entity8 has helped us to view the future with optimism			2

@entity8 goes to @entity9
award recognizes dangers and difficulties that body faces -- not because of @entity5
@entity14 chief says mission in @entity5 is " an operation that has never been tried before "
@entity9 has since ' 97 sought to implement *ban* on production , *storage* of chemical weapons
