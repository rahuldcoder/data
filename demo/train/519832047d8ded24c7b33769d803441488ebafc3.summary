@entity0 -- a former teacher at a @entity6 high school who claimed she was sexually harassed and verbally assaulted by her students has agreed to a $ 450,000 settlement from the city of @entity0 , her attorney and school officials told @entity1			1
as part of the settlement , @entity12 , 52 , resigned from the @entity14 in @entity6 in exchange for having poor ratings on her employment record cleared , her attorney said			1
the settlement was reached ahead of a trial that was scheduled to begin earlier this month			1
" i think we had a very strong case , " said attorney @entity19 , " but this way my client can go on with her life			1
" @entity25 told @entity1 she was subjected to continuous verbal assaults and sexual harassment by students , who she claimed touched her breasts and wrote insults against her on a desk , shortly after she began working at the school in 2005			1
the educator said she reported the students ' behavior to the school multiple times , but the principal 's response was worse than inadequate			2
" i was told i wanted to make the school look bad , i was called a troublemaker , " she said			2
" that was the worst for me : that my employer reacted this way			2
" in may 2008 , @entity19 wrote the @entity0 @entity44 to complain about the harassment allegations and the school 's response , and to ask for compensation			1
he said his client in some instances had been reprimanded or threatened with discipline if she insisted the school administration take action in response to an incident			2
the department responded that in each instance of reported misconduct , the students involved were " disciplined and / or dealt with appropriately , " and that no poor job performance marks against @entity25 were " a result of reporting any incident involving a student			2
" the department also said that in the course of its investigation , it was advised of an occasion in which reel " wore a low - cut , v - neck , lace top while teaching one of her classes			1
" the senior counsel wrote that " she should dress in an appropriate manner when working at school and teaching her classes			0
" @entity25 said she made multiple requests for a transfer from the school before filing a discrimination lawsuit			0
in may of this year , a judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to decide the case and set the trial date for september 10			1
the city made its settlement offer before the trial began			1
the education department said it does not comment on ongoing lawsuits or settlements , but the @entity94 issued a statement saying the agreement was based " on an assessment of the @entity99 's best interest in this case , which included obtaining an agreement from the plaintiff to leave the @entity103 's employment and not seek to be employed by our school system again			0
" when she took the job at the @entity6 high school , @entity25 said , she had already been teaching at the high school level for seven years			0
" i am not a 22 - year - old without any experience			0
i know how to handle a class , " she told @entity1 on friday , but this experience was so bad that it brought her to the brink of suicide			0
" every school year i hoped the situation would get better but it did n't , " @entity25 said			0
" i just did n't see the light at the end of the tunnel			0
i was emotionally and physically drained			0
" now , she says , she is happy to go on with her life			0
" i also hope what i did will empower other school teachers to go forward with similar cases			0
" @entity25 said she is " relieved " by the settlement and would like to look for a new job , probably in another state .			1
