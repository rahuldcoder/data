-- no @entity2 city does unintentional irony quite like @entity4			1
and @entity4 is always at its most unintentionally ironic during @entity5 ( @entity5 ) week , the january extravaganza that annually draws over 150,000 techno - tourists like myself to the seductively coercive city in the @entity11 desert to pay homage to the hottest new electronic products on the planet			1
this year , the unintentional ironies began as soon as we arrived in town			2
at @entity4 ' palatial @entity19 airport , we were greeted with a gigantic electronic billboard for @entity21 , a generous @entity5 sponsor and the dominant consumer electronics retailer in @entity2			1
it was a picture of a happy consumer being greeted by an even happier @entity21 sales assistant			2
retail nirvana , the electronic billboard advertised ; @entity21 , it promised , is the techno - consumer 's very best friend			2
but in @entity4 , of course , appearance is always the opposite of reality			1
so let 's imagine a rather different picture : of an unhappy consumer being " greeted " by an even unhappier @entity21 sales assistant			0
last week , in an article that went so viral that it elicited a panicked rebuttal from @entity21 's ceo , @entity40 author @entity39 explained why he believes the electronics retailer is gradually going out of business			1
" walk into one of the company 's retail locations or shop online			0
and try , really try , not to lose your temper , " @entity39 challenged his readers , before describing his own experience shopping there			0
so how do those 150,000 @entity5 attendees get from @entity56 to the packed @entity57 ? we queue			1
we queue to catch a cab in improbably long lines that snake around and around the airport 's cavernous concourse			0
and queuing -- or waiting in line , as my @entity2 friends like to say -- is the dominant mode of being at @entity5			1
we patiently queue for cabs , we queue to get our show badges , we queue for food and beverages , we queue for buses to and from the packed conventional centers , we queue to check in and out of our hotels , we queue to squeeze onto the city 's packed monorail system , and , of course , we dutifully queue on our return to @entity19 so that we can be x-rayed by the airport 's absurdly low - tech anti-terrorist machines			0
the unintentional irony of all this queuing is twofold			0
firstly , the whole message of @entity5 this year was mobility			1
all the most seductive electronic products on show at @entity5 promised to untether us from the world			1
smaller notebook computers , now euphemistically called " ultrabooks " , were thinner and smaller than ever			0
new smartphones were even smarter and easier to slip into our pockets			0
apps were more mobile , of course			0
while absurdly light tablet devices could be found on almost every table in every booth			0
so that 's the irony			0
the whole point of @entity5 is to stand in long , frustratingly slow moving lines to fondle devices that promise unlimited freedom			1
@entity5 , thus , achieved the impossible : it makes mobility immobile			1
but it 's the second unintentional irony of all this queuing that is even more delicious			0
you see , the more ces attendees queue , the more they wait in line to see the blob of an exhibition that now spread over several gigantic exhibition halls and casino - hotels , the less there is to see			2
yes , consumer electronics might be becoming more mobile -- but apart from this inevitable development , there were very few really memorable new products or technologies at @entity5 this year			1
the " next big thing " this year , supposedly , was that televisions are becoming see - through as well as thinner and more social			0
but , like a dieting commercial featuring impossibly thin models , @entity5 is always promising impossible thinness , particularly on its latest television screens			1
" @entity124 , " as one jaded @entity126 friend of mine repeats himself every year			0
how much more anorexic can television screens become , i wonder , before they double as gigantic @entity129 or cheese cutters			0
and a " see - though " lcd screen ? yes , that seems about as " must have " as goofy gadgets at @entity5 this year such as connected electronic scales for babies or ispeakers for the shower			2
meanwhile , " social " television has emerged as the ultimate mirage in the @entity11 desert			0
every year over the last ten years at @entity5 , we 've heard that television is going social			2
and then , every year , we go home from @entity5 to watch our television sets alone via sets that have little , if any , social functionality			2
then there 's that another perennial mirage at @entity5 -- 3d technology			2
this year , like every year in distant memory , i dutifully put on the plastic throwaway glasses to watch vertiginous 3d presentations			0
and this year , like every other year , i came away both dizzy and radically unimpressed with a technology that is neither essential nor affordable			2
no , the big story of @entity5 was what was happening elsewhere			2
while we all waited patiently in long lines to see nothing , the real technology news was being made back in @entity40			0
earlier this week , for example , @entity160 launched @entity162 in its attempt to socialize its search engine			0
meanwhile , rumors continue to circulate about a radically new ipad from @entity167 -- the world 's leading consumer electronics company that has never and will never attend @entity5 and whose ghost hung heavily over @entity4 this week			1
even @entity172 , a company that has historically invested millions of dollars at @entity5 as a sponsor and participant , made news this year by announcing that this year 's event would be the last that its ceo would keynote			1
so , in future , without @entity172 and @entity167 ( and @entity179 , another innovative company that has never wasted its time in @entity4 ) , it 's hard to avoid concluding that @entity5 will -- like @entity21 - gradually but inevitably go out of business			1
like @entity21 , i suspect , @entity5 has stood still over the last 10 years while the world has radically changed			1
the future of this kind of event celebrating technological innovation is probably far far away from the ubiquitous clanging of @entity4 ' slot machines			1
just as all electronic hardware devices are becoming networked , so the future of @entity5 is probably online , in the very networked world which is empowering our increasingly mobile gadgets			1
there , at least , there wo n't be any queues .			0

@entity200 says @entity5 has remained the same while the world has radically changed .
@entity200 : " ces will gradually but inevitably go out of business . "
" the future of this kind of event is probably far far away from @entity4 , " says @entity200
