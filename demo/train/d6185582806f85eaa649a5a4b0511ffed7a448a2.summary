-- a @entity1 777 , one of the world 's most reliable types of airliners , is missing , and no one knows why			1
was it a bomb ? mechanical failure ? a hijacking gone awry ? pilots and others in the aviation community are deeply disturbed by the mystery surrounding @entity15			2
it disappeared saturday en route from @entity18 to @entity19 over the @entity20 , somewhere between @entity21 and @entity22			1
it 's hard to believe that such huge questions remain four days after the @entity25 went missing , carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members			1
a revelation wednesday set off a fresh wave of speculation , as @entity32 officials said they had captured satellite images that show what could be wreckage from the plane			1
the situation is so unprecedented that experts have been careful in speculating about possible explanations			1
here are four scenarios they 're talking about , and the related facts : 1			2
scenario : mechanical failure ? fact : a satellite " observed a suspected crash area at sea , " @entity32 's @entity45 said wednesday			1
the images captured three floating objects that are 13 by 18 meters ( 43 by 59 feet ) , 14 by 19 meters ( 46 by 62 feet ) and 24 by 22 meters ( 79 feet by 72 feet )			2
analysis : the location of the objects is near the airplane 's original flight path			1
" this opens the door back to an aeronautical problem and not a human problem , " said @entity56 , a former managing director of the @entity57			0
but @entity62 , the @entity63 's former director of accident investigation , cautioned that the size of the objects might be too large to be wreckage from an airplane			1
" when an airplane goes into the water , whether it impacts intact or breaks up at high altitude , what floats are lighter - weight , typically interior components			1
major structural components will sink			1
so if this image -- and it 's a blurry image ; i 'm sure it will be more carefully analyzed -- if it 's true that the piece of wreckage is 40 by 70 feet , i would be very skeptical as to whether it 's part of that aircraft			1
" fact : air traffic controllers in @entity85 , outside @entity18 , lost contact with the plane over the sea between @entity21 and @entity22			1
a senior @entity21 @entity90 official said tuesday that radar tracking detected the flight an hour and 10 minutes later over the very small island of @entity94 , in the @entity95			1
this is hundreds of miles off course , traveling in the opposite direction from its original destination			0
but other @entity21 officials disputed that report			1
and on wednesday , @entity21 authorities said radar records did detect an unidentified aircraft moving into the @entity95 , but it was n't clear whether that plane was @entity15			1
analysis : if the plane did indeed change course and fly for more than an hour , an electrical problem on the plane could explain that , some experts say			1
" perhaps there was a power problem , and then there 's a backup power system			1
that backup power system is designed to last about an hour			0
it 's natural for the pilot , in my view , to return to where he knows , the airports and a region he knows , " said @entity116 , an aviation consultant and former @entity118 captain			1
" so turning around makes sense , and about an hour later , the airplane could become unflyable			0
" fact : the missing plane had suffered a clipped wing tip in the past , but @entity1 repaired it , and the jet was safe to fly , said @entity133 ceo @entity132 on sunday			1
analysis : " anytime there 's been previous damage to an airplane , even though it 's been repaired , and repaired within standards ... it kind of sends a warning flag , " says @entity135			1
experts agree the @entity1 is one of the world 's most reliable aircraft			1
during its development it was subject to some of the most rigorous testing in commercial aviation history			0
" i 've been talking with colleagues , " @entity135 says			0
" we 're all baffled by this			1
" the 777 boasts some of the most powerful and well - tested engines in the world , he says			0
" the reliability of airliner engines in general is impeccable these days , " he says			1
" this is a safe plane			1
" looking for a needle in a haystack 2			0
scenario : hijacking ? fact : before it disappeared , radar data indicated the plane may have turned around to head back to @entity18			1
is that a clue that a hijacker had ordered the plane to change course ? analysis : so far , there have been no reports that the flight crew sent any signals that a hijacking had occurred			2
some experts say that could have been deliberate			2
others say a mechanical failure could have been what stopped the pilots from reporting a problem			0
fact : the plane had stopped sending identifying transponder codes before it disappeared			2
analysis : " given that this airplane has so many redundant electrical systems on it , my first reaction would be that somebody ... purposely turned it off , " said @entity188 , a former @entity57 member			0
" a pilot would not do that			0
somebody that did n't want to be seen very well would do that			0
" @entity200 , a retired commercial pilot and safety consultant , said the situation sounds fishy			0
" this was a fairly modern airplane with a bunch of capability to communicate with the outside world			0
a lot of data transmissions from the airplane , " he said			0
" for them to all stop at the same time would take the work of somebody who has actually studied the systems in some detail to know how to turn off all of the systems at the same time			0
" turning off a transponder is a " deliberate process , " @entity56 said			0
" if someone did that in the cockpit , " he said , " they were doing it to disguise the route of the plane			2
" was someone unauthorized inside the cockpit , ordering the transponders to be turned off and the plane to be turned around ? or , he said , " did one of the pilots do it themselves ? " 3			2
scenario : pilot error fact : so far , there are no known indications that pilot error contributed to the aircraft going missing			2
analysis : some aviation experts have compared @entity15 to the crash of @entity243 in 2009			1
all 228 passengers and crew died when the plane went down in a storm in the @entity248 en route from @entity250 to @entity251			2
after an expensive , nearly two - year search across the deep ocean floor , the twin - engine @entity253 's wreckage was finally found and the voice and data recorders recovered			2
a @entity260 investigation blamed flight crew for failing to understand " they were in a stall situation and therefore never undertook any recovery maneuvers			0
" but unlike @entity243 , weather was reported as good along flight 370 's scheduled route and did n't appear to present a threat			2
@entity269 217 -- a @entity1 777 -- fell short during a runway approach last july at @entity271			0
three people were killed and more than 180 others hurt			0
@entity57 investigators have focused on pilot reliance on automated flight systems as a possible contributor to the crash , but a final report has not yet been released			2
scenario : terrorist attack ? fact : two stolen passports have been linked to people who held tickets for the flight			0
@entity287 identified the men using the stolen passports as @entity290 , 18 , and @entity291 , 29 , both @entity292			0
@entity21 police believe @entity290 was trying to emigrate to @entity294 using the stolen @entity296 passport			1
analysis : @entity21 investigators say there 's no evidence to suggest either person traveling with a stolen passport was connected to any terrorist organizations			1
@entity287 has a similar take			0
" the more information we get , the more we 're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident , " @entity287 secretary general @entity305 said			0
but some experts have questioned whether the use of the stolen passports suggests problems with the security screening for the flight			2
and cia director @entity315 said his agency is not yet willing to discount the possibility of a terror link in what he called a " very disturbing " mystery			0
" no , we 're not ruling it out			0
not at all , " he said tuesday			0
fact : no one has claimed credit for any terrorist act tied with the plane 's disappearance			1
analysis : but terrorism still ca n't be ruled out , said @entity330 , former executive assistant director of the @entity331			0
" there might be another reason for them not coming forward at this point , " he said			0
" if it was a terrorist incident ... if this was part of a much larger or broader potential act , and for whatever reason , they would n't come forward at this point , but at a later time			0
" fact : so far , no debris field of plane wreckage has been linked to the 777 , which would indicate a bomb blast			2
analysis : when @entity351 , former vice chairman of the @entity57 , heard about the missing plane , his immediate thought was : " for some reason the aircraft blew up and there was no signal , there was nothing			1
" the fact that the plane disappeared from radar without warning indicated to @entity351 " there was something unprecedented that has n't happened before			1
" what about satellite technology ? is it possible that data from orbiting satellites might show a flash or infrared heat signature from an explosion ? very unlikely , says satellite expert @entity373 , who spent years tracking space junk in orbit for the @entity90			2
dozens of government and private satellites orbit the earth , looking down from distances from 300 kilometers to 1,500 kilometers ( 185 to 930 miles )			0
it 's a long shot that one of them coincidentally floated over at the exact right time and location to capture a flash from an explosion			2
however , there 's an " off chance , " @entity373 says , that a super-secret @entity391 government satellite orbiting 22,000 miles in space might have grabbed evidence			1
these satellites are in geosynchronous orbit			0
as a group , they can observe virtually the entire globe			0
" we know that their mission is to detect ballistic missile launches via heat , " says @entity373 , now a technical adviser for @entity399			0
" we do n't know if they 're sensitive enough to track something like a bomb blast , even if that 's what happened			1
" then there 's another unanswerable question : would the government hesitate to release such an image for fear of revealing the satellite system 's ultraclassified capability ? who travels with a stolen passport ? @entity0 's @entity418 and @entity419 contributed to this report .			1

new : @entity32 : a satellite has " observed a suspected crash area at sea "
a @entity21 *military* official 's revelation sets off a fresh wave of speculation
' baffled ' experts speculate on what happened to missing airliner
did the plane ditch on the water and then sink ?
