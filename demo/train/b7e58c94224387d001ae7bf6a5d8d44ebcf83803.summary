@entity0 -- one hundred and fifty new full - body scanning machines are set to be placed in airports across the @entity4 as federal authorities work to close security loopholes exposed by the attempted @entity8 bombing of a @entity4 - bound airliner			1
the @entity10 ordered the scanners before the bombing attempt for up to $ 170,000 apiece			1
plans are also in place to purchase an additional 300 units by 2012 , @entity10 officials said			1
forty body scanners are currently in use at 19 @entity4 airports			1
use of the technology -- considered overly invasive by critics -- is optional , according to the @entity10 web site			1
passengers who opt out of the screening receive an alternate form of checking , which includes a pat - down procedure			0
there are two types of full - body scanners			1
one uses " backscatter " technology to produce an x-ray image of a person			0
the other uses millimeter - wave technology , which shows a detailed photo negative			0
@entity10 officials have attempted to address privacy concerns by promising to blur pictures of passengers ' faces and delete all images produced			2
one former @entity10 official told @entity1 that a body scanner could have stopped @entity47 , the man accused of trying to blow up a december 25 @entity49 flight from @entity50 , @entity51 , to @entity52 , @entity53			2
" i firmly believe in the whole body imaging system as a screening device , " @entity54 said			0
" i believe that it would have detected that there was something there in that position on his body			0
it may not have detected it as an explosive , but it certainly would 've raised some flags that would have required further detection and a review either by an officer or further scanning			0
" critics , however , warn that full - body scanners should not be the only answer to continued airport security problems			1
" right now the system is not working as effectively as it needs to be , " said @entity75 , a representative of the @entity76			0
" it 's time to hit the pause button and do a wholesale review of what we have today and put in place the policies that will ( give ) @entity4 the most secure and efficient travel process			2
