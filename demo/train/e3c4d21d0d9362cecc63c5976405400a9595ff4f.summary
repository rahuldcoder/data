-- if you work for @entity2 , you can bring your @entity3 to work , but forget about using the phone 's voice - activated digital assistant			1
@entity6 is n't welcome on @entity2 's networks			1
the reason ? @entity6 ships everything you say to her to a big data center in @entity12 , @entity13			2
and the story of what really happens to all of your @entity6 - launched searches , e-mail messages and inappropriate jokes is a bit of a black box			2
@entity2 cio @entity22 told @entity24 's @entity23 this week that her company has banned @entity6 outright because , according to the magazine , " the company worries that the spoken queries might be stored somewhere			1
" @entity31 's new ' spaceship ' campus : what will the neighbors say ? it turns out that @entity22 is right to worry			2
in fact , @entity31 's @entity35 spells this out : " when you use @entity6 or @entity40 , the things you say will be recorded and sent to @entity31 in order to convert what you say into text , " @entity31 says			1
@entity6 collects a bunch of other information -- names of people from your address book and other unspecified user data , all to help @entity6 do a better job			0
how long does @entity31 store all of this stuff , and who gets a look at it ? well , the company does n't actually say			1
again , from the user agreement : " by using @entity6 or @entity40 , you agree and consent to @entity31 's and its subsidiaries ' and agents ' transmission , collection , maintenance , processing , and use of this information , including your voice input and @entity69 , to provide and improve @entity6 , @entity40 , and other @entity31 products and services			1
" @entity31 and @entity73 begin settlement talks because some of the data that @entity6 collects can be very personal , the @entity75 put out a warning about @entity6 just a couple of months ago			1
privacy was always a big concern for @entity6 's developers , says @entity82 , the lead developer of the original @entity3 app , which was eventually acquired by @entity31			1
and for corporate users , there are even more potential pitfalls			0
" just having it known that you 're at a certain customer 's location might be in violation of a non-disclosure agreement , " he says			0
@entity31 designer ' winces ' over some past product choices but he agrees that many of the issues raised by @entity31 's @entity6 data handling are similar to those that other internet companies face			2
" i really do n't think it 's something to worry about , " he says			0
" people are already doing things on these mobile devices			0
maybe @entity6 makes their life a little bit easier , but it 's not exactly opening up a new avenue that was n't there before			0
" but other companies have been pressured by privacy groups over the way they store customer data			0
@entity115 , for example , has come under fire in the past for the way it handles a massive database of user search data			0
but @entity2 does n't ban @entity115			0
neither @entity31 nor @entity2 could be reached for comment tuesday , but there are a couple of important differences between @entity6 and @entity115 that may have @entity2 worried : for one , @entity6 can be used to write e-mails or text messages			1
so , in theory , @entity31 could be storing confidential @entity2 messages			1
former @entity31 employee explains ' upside - down ' logo another difference : after being dogged by privacy advocates , @entity115 now anonymizes search results -- making them difficult , if not impossible , to trace back to an individual user -- after nine months			0
maybe if @entity31 agreed to do something like that , @entity6 would be welcome over in @entity138 , @entity139			2
