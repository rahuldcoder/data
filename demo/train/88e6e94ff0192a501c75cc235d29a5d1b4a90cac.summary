-- what 's @entity2 for " twerk ? " @entity5 officials are in no hurry to find out			1
this is one @entity8 import our southern neighbor wants nothing to do with			0
ditto for @entity13 , the controversial singer known less for her music than for her over-sexualized on - stage spectacles intended to get attention and shock the senses			1
@entity13 accomplished both on the @entity19 -- better known , on this side of the border , as september 16th			2
north of the @entity22 , that day is like any other , as insignificant as the @entity23 is in @entity24			0
however , in @entity5 , the day is awfully important			1
and since @entity5 are a proud people who put a high value on respect , it 's probably not a good idea for @entity8 -- or anyone else for that matter -- to go to @entity5 on @entity19 and show disrespect to , oh , the @entity5 flag			1
that 's what @entity13 and fellow performers did last week during a concert in the northern city of @entity40 in a stunt that gives new meaning to the phrase " ugly @entity8			1
" as @entity13 " twerked " onstage , while wearing -- yes , you read this right -- a giant prosthetic butt , her backup singers whipped her with rolled up pieces of cloth that turned out to be miniature @entity5 flags			1
it was a trifecta of bad judgment -- the wrong thing to do , the wrong country to do it in , and all of it happening on the wrong day			0
before you could say international incident , outraged @entity5 state legislators asked the federal government to fine the pop star for desecrating the @entity5 flag			1
under a law that prohibits abuse of " national emblems , the flag and the national anthem , " such a transgression can normally earn someone a $ 1,270 fine as well as , in some cases , a couple of days in jail			0
the legislators are asking that @entity13 get locked up for 36 hours			2
there are those in this country who will claim that the singer is being singled out because she is an @entity8			0
but actually , in this case , equal treatment would call out for some sort of punishment			0
it 's a good time to send a message			0
in 2008 , @entity5 pop star @entity84 was fined $ 4,000 for appearing in a @entity2 magazine , clutching a @entity5 flag wrapped around her naked body			1
what the 21 - year - old @entity13 and her crew did was tasteless and thoughtless			1
and whether or not @entity5 officials decide to formally charge her with desecrating the @entity5 flag , she ought to apologize -- in person , and on @entity5 soil			1
having said that , @entity5 officials need to be careful not to overplay their hand and protest too much , lest they turn legitimate concerns about professional decorum in the entertainment industry into dinner theater			2
the initial response was not encouraging			0
speaking to @entity0 , @entity101 rep. @entity100 said this : " i am truly offended and annoyed by the fact that a foreign artist feels like she can come here and make fun of and mock our national flag on @entity23 , september 16th			2
" seriously ? @entity109 ca n't really believe that the stunt was intended as a direct assault on the @entity5 flag			1
an assault on decency and good manners , maybe			0
does he think this was some sort of political statement ? he is probably giving @entity13 and her backup dancers too much credit			2
finally , is this really an attempt to mock the flag ? the dancers used it as a prop , but the idea was clearly to draw attention to @entity13 -- not the flag			1
as a @entity131 , i realize that , in @entity5 , my grandfather 's homeland , the second-most popular sport -- after soccer -- is @entity8 bashing			2
and @entity13 played right into the hands of our neighbors by giving them a weapon to wield against us			0
but @entity5 do n't always have to play that game			1
let 's hope that they treat this for what it is -- an isolated incident by an immature and attention starved pop singer			0
the @entity8 - @entity5 relationship is strong			0
it has suffered through war , conquest , revolution , migration , xenophobia , gun running , drugs , protectionism , @entity162 , income disparity and more			0
it can suffer fools .			0

@entity167 : @entity13 concert in @entity40 , @entity5 made tasteless use of @entity5 flag
@entity167 : what made it particularly *egregious* was that it came on @entity5 *independence* day
he says @entity13 should apologize and could be fined but do n't make it an international incident
