-- is the @entity1 the world 's next @entity2 ? that 's the question some are beginning to ask about a crisis that has been going on for most of this year but has only just burst through into the mainstream international mass media			1
warlords ruling the countryside by terror , a government that is almost toothless and the collapse of institutions have forced 0.4 million people to flee their homes and left a million dependent on aid			1
and now reports of @entity18 and @entity19 communities engaged in inter-communal violence have sparked concern about a slide into religious conflict			1
the " g - word " -- genocide -- has even been floated as a real risk by some observers			0
in fact the country has not yet sunk that far			0
there is no sign of ideological motivation or the systematic political organization of mass killings			0

but time is pressing and it is only now that the international community has fully appreciated the danger of the situation			0
the @entity46 is next week expected to vote , authorizing the deployment of a reinforced peacekeeping force under the banner of the @entity50 or , potentially , the @entity46 itself			0
meanwhile , @entity52 , which already has 400 troops in the car , has announced the dispatch of a further 800 - 1000 , to work alongside @entity56 peacekeepers			1

by contrast , @entity61 shot right to the top of the agenda when its northern regions were taken over by jihadist armed groups in march - april last year			1
yet even then , it took many months of diplomacy to secure @entity46 endorsement of @entity56 and , ultimately , @entity52 military intervention to tackle the crisis			1

as its name suggests , the country lies at the very heart of the @entity56 continent , away from major trade routes and population centers , and very far indeed from public attention			1
with only 4.5 million people but a territory the size of @entity52 it matters in strategic terms but has rarely hit the headlines , at least not since the dictator @entity87 proclaimed himself emperor back in the 1970s -- a story of almost picturesque caricature that distracted attention from the harsh underlying reality of poverty , isolation and incompetent government			1
chronic instability the country has slid into its present condition of almost complete state collapse , leaving free rein to looting and murderous rebel groups , partly because the outside world did not perceive its earlier condition of chronic instability and political weakness as a risk to @entity60 or even the region as a whole			1
for many years the @entity38 's persistent problems have been a sad humanitarian story , with a daunting incidence of diseases such as malaria , @entity114 and sleeping sickness , and depressingly high rates of child mortality and malnutrition			2
even before the present crisis , life expectancy , at just 48 years , was the second lowest in the world			0
but in spite of these dismal health and development conditions , the @entity38 's problems impinged little on neighboring states -- other than occasional localized movements of refugees into remote fringe regions of @entity129 , @entity130 or @entity131			2
over recent years the then president , @entity132 -- who himself originally came to power through rebellion in 2003 , before repackaging himself through a democratic election -- found himself confronting a string of rebel uprisings			2
these were fueled by local grievances , the ambitions of disgruntled warlords and faction leaders and the heavy - handed tactics of @entity132 's presidential guard			2
peace - keeping through a peace process hosted by @entity146 and the presence of a small peacekeeping force , @entity56 neighbors attempted to contain these problems and nudge the car towards a consensual domestic settlement			2
in january this year a respected human rights lawyer , @entity151 , was appointed as a neutral prime minister			0
but some faction leaders stayed out of this peace process , combining their forces to launch a military campaign to depose @entity132			0
as this rebel movement , @entity159 , advanced south towards the capital , @entity157 , government forces crumbled , while @entity56 troops sent to help @entity132 suffered defeat with heavy casualties			1
the president fled and @entity159 leader @entity165 proclaimed himself head of state			2
but almost immediately he found his authority disintegrating			0
read more : car president fled to @entity129 the kernel of @entity159 are native @entity1 , mostly from the country 's northern @entity18 minority			1
but many of the rebellion 's fighters were foreigners , particularly from @entity176 , in @entity177 , and from @entity130			0
they expected to be rewarded for their efforts -- but @entity165 had found no cash to pay them			0
faction commanders turned on the civilian population instead , engaging in months of looting and brutal violence , and seizing local resources such as diamonds -- which are mined in several areas of the car			0
their brutality towards the largely @entity19 population sparked the latter into forming self - defense groups -- who have taken revenge on local @entity18 communities with whom they peacefully co-existed before			2
meanwhile , the state has stood by powerless , lacking the military and political means to bring a halt to this deepening crisis -- or the practical resources to help civilians			0
it is this spiral of state collapse and spreading violence that the new reinforced @entity56 and @entity52 deployment hopes to halt			1

a *coalition* of rebel groups ousted the @entity1 's president in march

reports of inter-communal violence have sparked fears of a slide into religious conflict
