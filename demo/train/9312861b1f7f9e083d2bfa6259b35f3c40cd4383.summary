-- the census is inherently political , even if most people do n't see it that way			1
every 10 years , new census data is used to reapportion congressional seats across the country , while all states must use the census to redraw congressional districts			1
these processes do n't get much attention , but the stakes are high : they help determine control of @entity15 and state legislatures and , because they determine the @entity19 map , who wins the @entity21			2
and the census 's political influence does n't stop there			1
because it presents a unique demographic portrait of the country , the census is mined for political intelligence by strategists from both parties and applied to campaigns from the county level all the way up to the presidency			1
here are eight political takeaways from the @entity36 : 1			0
@entity37 need to improve relations with @entity39			1
the single biggest headline from the @entity36 may be the explosion in @entity39 growth			1
more than half of @entity46 population growth in the last decade is due to growth among @entity39 ; nearly one in six @entity46 now identify as @entity39			1
that 's bad news for republicans , who 've seen @entity39 support slip since 2004 , when president @entity52 made major inroads among those voters			1
@entity52 won 44 percent of @entity39			1
last november , by contrast , when the @entity37 wave swept control of the @entity21 out of @entity58 hands , @entity37 captured just 38 percent of that vote			1
much of the falloff is due to the tough @entity37 line on illegal immigration , including widespread @entity37 opposition to immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented workers			1
@entity52 's efforts at such reform were brought down by his own party			0
and then there 's @entity74 's 2010 immigration law , championed by @entity37 , that requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and allows police to question people 's residency status while enforcing other laws			1
@entity82 , president of @entity83 and an influential conservative strategist , says the problem runs deeper			0
" republicans have not reached out to @entity39 as they should have for the last 20 years , " he says			1
" the census numbers are not the wake - up call , they 're the follow - up call			0
" look for a handful of rising @entity39 @entity37 stars , like newly elected @entity93 sen. @entity92 , to echo that line			1
@entity58 need to compete harder in red states of the 12 new @entity46 @entity21 seats that will be created this year because of population shifts revealed by the @entity36 , eight are in solidly red states : @entity74 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			1
the booming @entity39 population -- among which @entity58 have an advantage -- is responsible for much of that growth , but not all of it			1
demographers say there has also been a migration of @entity46 from the @entity111 and the @entity112 , both traditional @entity58 strongholds , to the more @entity37 - dominated @entity101 and @entity114			1
@entity37 strategists argue that those transplants are more likely to be entrepreneurial and connected to business -- and therefore more likely to vote @entity37			1
and they say that policies like no state income tax in @entity102 and @entity93 , identified with the @entity37 , will win over new arrivals			1
" people who are showing up here are tired of policies that have driven jobs and families from their old states , " says @entity121 , a spokesman for the @entity122			0
" they 're showing up with a chip on their shoulders about failed government policies			0
" @entity58 pollster @entity132 , who worked for president @entity133 in the 2008 campaign , wo n't go that far			0
but he says his party has a lot of work to do in the @entity101 and @entity114			0
" the western states do n't lean left , so the @entity58 has to shift its brand , " he says			2
" issues like new energy sources and energy independence are what appeal to a @entity145 audience			0
the battleground states are moving south and west it was n't long ago that @entity149 was considered the central battleground in presidential politics			1
winning the @entity149 put @entity52 over the top in 2004			0
but @entity149 and other @entity112 battlegrounds have seen their populations plateau , shifting electorate clout to the @entity114 and parts of the @entity101 , like @entity100 and @entity158			0
the @entity36 numbers will take two @entity21 seats each from @entity149 and @entity161 and give seats to states like @entity100 and @entity74			0
but it 's not just that @entity166 and @entity145 states are gaining political muscle			2
they 're also growing more politically competitive , thanks to increasing racial diversity and suburbanization , both threats to @entity37 hegemony			2
" moving forward , " @entity132 says , " we 're going to be waiting for returns from states like @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity74 to determine how our national elections turn out			2
new electoral math makes it harder for a @entity182 to win the presidency in shifting congressional seats to the @entity101 and @entity114 , the @entity36 is also shifting @entity19 votes in that same direction			1
while deep blue @entity161 will lose two @entity19 votes , deep red @entity102 will pick up four			0
measured against the national total of 538 electoral college votes -- used to determine the outcome of presidential elections -- such modest swings might seem like small potatoes			0
they certainly would n't have mattered in the landslide 2008 election , when @entity133 beat @entity37 presidential nominee @entity197 by 192 electoral votes			1
but in squeaker elections like 2000 , when @entity52 bested @entity201 by just five electoral votes , the slightly revised electoral math could have big consequences			1
mormon political influence is growing the @entity205 has n't asked @entity46 about their religious affiliation since the 1950s , saying that such questions infringe church / state separation rights			2
but the @entity36 found that @entity103 , home to the headquarters for the @entity210 and to the nation 's largest @entity212 population , was the second - fastest - growing state in the last decade , seeing a 24 percent population spike			2
the other three fastest - growing states -- @entity178 , @entity74 and @entity217 -- all have substantial @entity212 minorities			0
with @entity212 numbers growing , through high birth rates and proselytization , and with the religion gaining greater acceptance among other @entity46 , especially in the @entity114 , look for more @entity212 - fueled political activism , especially in the @entity37			2
the trend is already visible : former @entity227 gov. @entity226 and former @entity103 gov. @entity228 , both @entity212 , may soon announce bids for the presidency			0
the face of @entity46 politics will get less white @entity133 is the country 's first @entity234 - @entity46 president , but , racially speaking , he 's probably more of a sign of things to come than a political anomaly			0
new census figures show that minorities are becoming a bigger slice of the @entity46 pie , while white @entity46 are claiming a smaller share			0
in fact , white @entity46 were the only racial group to see their proportion of the population shrink in the last 10 years , from 75 percent to 72 percent			0
want to help define @entity46 ? take the @entity249 cultural census that 's due to more than just @entity39 growth			1
the @entity254 population , for instance , grew by 43 percent in the last decade , faster than any other major racial group			0
the election of @entity258 - @entity46 governors like @entity259 in @entity260 and @entity261 in @entity101 , both @entity37 , shows how the face of politics is already changing to reflect the new racial map			2
the next frontier : @entity15 , where whites are still overrepresented			0
asians occupy just 3 % of congressional seats , while @entity39 occupy 6 % -- substantially less than those groups ' shares of the nation 's population			1
our politics are moving from country to city , or at least near the city more than 80 % of @entity46 now live in metropolitan areas -- places with cities of 50,000 or more people			0
an additional 10 % , the @entity36 found , live in so - called micropolitan areas , organized around towns of 10,000 to 50,000			0
both kinds of population - dense areas saw big growth in the last decade , with greater @entity288 and metro @entity289 watching their numbers surge by around 25 percent			0
some of that growth came on the backs of the country 's rural areas			0
the census found that large swaths of @entity297 and the @entity298 -- which encompasses the @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 and the @entity102 panhandle -- lost population			2
many @entity58 argue that a national shift from traditionally @entity37 rural areas to more urban ones gives them a leg up			2
" it 's the red states that are growing , but it 's blue terrain in those states , " says @entity308 , a spokesman for the @entity309			2
but it 's suburban and exurban counties -- as opposed to cities themselves -- that are seeing the biggest growth , which means that areas outside of cities are becoming more politically powerful -- they 'll be focal points for many new @entity21 districts that will be carved up this year -- and more competitive , but not necessarily more @entity58			0
2011 is a good year to be a @entity37 ok , this is n't political intelligence gleaned from the census -- it 's a fact that will determine how census numbers are used politically : the state governments tasked with drawing up new @entity21 districts based on the most recent census data are dominated by @entity37			1
every 10 years , each state is required to draw up new congressional and state legislative districts that reflect population shifts from the last census			2
this year , the @entity37 has a big advantage : it controls 26 state legislatures , while @entity58 control just 15 , with eight others divided			2
( @entity301 , not included in that tally , has a nonpartisan legislature			0
) " republicans are in the best position for redistricting since the 1960s , " says @entity339 , senior fellow with the @entity340			0
redistricting of @entity21 and state legislative districts will occur in all states by early next year			2
look for @entity58 to challenge most of the redistricting plans in @entity37 - controlled states -- and for the @entity37 to do the same in @entity58 - controlled states			1
political posturing around the process is already under way			0
" even in places where @entity37 control the process , " says the @entity309 's @entity308 , " they ca n't control the demographic realities that voter growth is happening among @entity58 communities			1

the census 's influence does n't stop with redistricting
@entity39 population is *exploding* , but @entity37 has seen @entity39 support slip since 2004
the battleground states are moving south and west
new electoral math makes it harder for a @entity182 to win the presidency
