staring out over @entity6 's @entity5 glacier , a cruel , frozen landscape of white ice broken by blue crevasses , it 's easy to imagine myself in some distant world on the other side of the universe			1
it 's bleak and cold , but beautiful in an otherworldly way			2
this is the stand - in for an alien world that director @entity15 used for his doom - laden new movie " @entity21 , " instead of spending squillions on @entity20 backdrops			2
in the film -- released by @entity23 , which like @entity24 is owned by @entity25 -- astronauts played by @entity28 and @entity29 plunge through a space wormhole in search of an alternative to a dying @entity33			2
while the plot might be baffling , if some reviews are to be believed , the reason for choosing @entity5 is n't			1
forged by harsh winters and angry volcanic forces , it 's like nowhere else i 've seen on @entity33 -- cinematic			2
the same can be said for many other locations in @entity6 , which is why the country 's become a go - to destination for a slew of sci - fi directors			1
hostile planet @entity5 does n't have a lengthy role in " @entity21 , " but it 's featured strongly in posters and trailer scenes showing @entity28 walking across a hostile , wintry terrain			1
it looks so incredible , i wanted to see it for myself			0
reaching @entity5 is easier than blasting through an intergalactic breach , but only just			1
what should be a five - hour drive along the southern stretch of @entity6 's @entity56 -- for most parts a two - lane blacktop that loops from @entity59 around the country 's perimeter -- is made longer by frequent stops for slack - jawed gawping at mind - boggling scenery			1
there are snow - capped volcanoes , plunging waterfalls , terrible cliffs and bizarre petrified landscapes coated with lurid green moss			0
at one point the road crosses a broad , featureless lava field whose pitch - dark terrain is only rendered distinguishable from the highway by painted white lines			0
i arrive at the glacier as night falls and spend the night at the @entity80 ( @entity81 2 @entity82 , 785 @entity83 ; +354 478 1945 ) , an unfussy but welcoming stop in the bleak shadow of the ice field that 's equipped with an excellent restaurant and talented wait staff			1
the hotel was used as a watering hole for the " @entity21 " crew in september 2013 , but if the receptionist at the front desk was left starstruck by the celebs passing through its sliding doors , she is n't letting on			0
" we 've had lots of them , " she says dismissively			0
" they 're always filming here			0
" @entity103 world daylight arrives after 9 a.m. -- it 's late october -- and brings with it views of clouded mountains			2
a weak sun pushes its way over the southern horizon and the temperature hovers a couple of notches above freezing			0
at a nearby hut operated by @entity118 , i join a small group embarking on a hiking tour of the glacier			2
we 're kitted out with crampons and ice axes			2
our guide , @entity125 , gives us a rudimentary lesson in staying upright on the ice			2
" walk like a cowboy , not a ballerina , " he advises , chiefly to ensure we do n't impale ourselves on our own spikes , but also for better balance			0
and then we 're let loose on the glacier			2
@entity5 lies at the foot of @entity135 , said to be the largest glacier outside of polar regions			1
awestruck by the sheer bombast of the jagged world stretching ahead of us , we 're silent at first			0
the only sounds are our crampons scraping the ice and winds howling higher up the mountain			2
i 'm by no means alone -- there are eight of us in our group , plus another huddled about half a mile away -- but looking out over this huge , empty expanse of vicious ridges stretching up to @entity135 , there 's a daunting sense of being a long way from home			1
before we get too overwhelmed , @entity156 leads us up and down the great folds in the ice to the brink of yawning crevasses where glassy , blue ice plunges to unknown depths			2
to gauge one , he hurls down a boulder and we listen to it clatter against the fissure 's walls			2
it 's a long way down			2
@entity156 says the glacier is advancing up to 65 meters ( 213 feet ) per year , although summer temperatures melt back two - thirds of that advance			0
friction as the massive weight of ice creeps forward over the rocks below causes new crevasses to open up and old ones to close			0
higher up the hillside , where the ice began its journey about 200 years ago , it can reach depths of up to a kilometer			1
the size of the fissures there make the higher reaches impassable on foot			0
frozen carcasses @entity156 tells us of farmers who lost sheep to holes in the ice , only to recover them as " frozen meals " when the glacier spat them years later			1
there 's also a tragic , true story about two @entity200 scientists who went missing on the mountain above during an expedition in the 1950s			0
decades later , what is believed to be their equipment emerged from the ice and is now on display in the glacier 's visitor center			1
" if you drop your @entity211 here , you can probably come back and get in 20 years , " says @entity156			0
" there 's a saying : whatever the ice takes , it always gives back			1
" with these tales ringing in our ears , he takes us down into a moulin -- a smooth - sided tunnel carved through the ice by meltwaters that 's as beautiful as it is claustrophobic			1
then we 're back out on the open ice , tramping on metal claws across the glistening geological maze that stretches away all around us			0
on our way back to firmer soil , @entity125 shows us the icy expanse where the 350 - strong cast and crew of " @entity21 " spent two weeks filming			0
" they booked the whole glacier right at the height of the season , " he says			0
" they built their own road to drive vehicles onto the glacier and even brought a spaceship			0
" today there 's no sign they were ever here			0
any trace of their presence has long since been swallowed by the advancing ice			0
lights , camera , @entity6 it 's not just " @entity21			1
" here are some of the other recent films that have used @entity6 to double for fictional realms			1
" @entity256 " @entity258 's pompous " @entity259 " prequel may have failed to live up to the hype , but that was n't @entity6 's fault			1
the country 's glowering landscape was used as a stand - in for a prehistoric earth visited by a pallid alien creature clad only in underpants			0
among key locations was @entity270 , a thundering waterfall at the far north of the @entity273			0
" @entity274 " there are n't many good - looking locations in @entity277 that have n't been plundered by this beard - heavy tv show about squabbling nobility , so little surprise @entity6 has been featured			1
hverfjall volcano , close to northern @entity6 's @entity282 , has cropped up in the long - running series , portraying the wintry land of @entity285			1
the southwestern @entity286 and the northern @entity287 have also made appearances			0
" @entity289 " " @entity21 " director @entity15 is a return visitor to @entity6			1
his 2005 reboot of the caped crusader series , " @entity289 , " brought him to @entity293 , a breathtakingly beautiful glacial lagoon to the east of @entity5 that can be visited on the same day			1
there are daily boat trips among the lagoon 's stunning blue icebergs to watch seals hunting for fish			0
two @entity303 movies -- " @entity301 " and " @entity304 " -- had parts filmed here , as did " @entity306			0
" " @entity307 " not even " @entity307 " star @entity308 could chew the scenery in @entity6 , which is possibly why director @entity310 filmed his recent biblical epic here			1
the tale of flood and salvation used the dramatic basalt scenery of @entity317 and @entity318 near the town of @entity320 -- on the road to @entity5 -- to stand in for antediluvian @entity33			1
tours of @entity5 can be arranged through @entity323 ; +354 587 9999			1

@entity6 's vast @entity5 glacier was used as film set for the new " *interstellar* " movie
@entity5 lies at the foot of @entity135 , said to be the largest glacier outside of polar regions
ice at the foot of the glacier can be up to 200 years old
