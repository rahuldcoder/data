in @entity1 prominent liberals are now supporting a military - backed government overseeing a resurgence of @entity5 authoritarianism			1
since the ouster of president @entity9 on july 3 , those few remaining true to basic principles have found themselves marginalized as the goals of the 2011 revolution are squandered by the military			0
many of the self - identified liberals who filled the streets of downtown @entity16 on june 30 demanding @entity9 's resignation justified their actions by pointing to a broken political system and the absence of democracy			2
in the eyes of protesters , @entity9 used his electoral victory as a free pass to enforce an authoritarian style of government which denied its people basic human rights , supervised an increase in sectarian violence , and prioritized a regional @entity33 agenda over the basic needs of the @entity1 people			2
although these same " liberals " described their revolution as democracy in action , a considerable number of them have since supported the increasingly authoritarian decisions of the interim government which followed			0
the targets of these actions expand beyond the @entity47 to a comprehensive swath of @entity1 society as journalists and activists are detained , satirical programs are canceled by private networks , and the constitutional drafting committee proposes laws meant to restrict freedom of expression and @entity59 operation			1
@entity1 's armed forces , the driving force behind these events , has simultaneously amended its oath to renounce loyalty to the elected president and sought after immunity for its top leaders			1
@entity1 's liberals have responded to these moves with outward support on numerous occasions			1
perhaps most disheartening is the explicit praise and backing coming from leaders of @entity1 's @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , a liberal - left coalition formed in opposition to @entity9 's authoritarian rule			1
current @entity74 leader and former secretary general of the @entity80 league , @entity78 , presently chairs the same constitutional drafting committee unable to scale back military authority and secure basic civil liberties while @entity85 leader and @entity74 stalwart @entity86 , recently stated that the @entity74 will endorse general @entity88 's prospective presidential bid			2
much of @entity74 's leadership has also supported the interim government 's violent dispersal of sit - ins at @entity93 and @entity94 , an event which claimed the lives of hundreds of @entity1			1
more recently , the same supposed bedrock of @entity1 liberalism failed to condemn a court ruling that disbanded the @entity47 and a constitutional provision granting the military immunity			1
on the surface , the predicament of liberals seems illogical			0
what would drive a high - ranking , liberal public official to back such a flagrant disregard for civil liberties and transparent government ? the answer lies within the @entity1 electorate			0
since january 2011 , liberals have failed to instill their values within the political ideology of @entity1 's voters			1
amanpour blog : @entity1 not on a ' proper path to democracy , ' suggests @entity1 deputy pm in fact , since the revolution , more than two - thirds of the votes across parliamentary elections , the constitutional referendum , and the presidential election have gone to representatives of political @entity129			0
former presidential candidates , @entity131 and @entity78 , who captured roughly 20 % and 11 % of the vote respectively , are now opting for a new strategy : " if you ca n't beat them , ban them			0
" the @entity47 and its allies within political @entity129 can not be beat fair and square so liberals are now opportunistically working with the military to efface them from @entity1 life			1
the result is a man - made political landscape handcrafted to undemocratically meet the needs of the country 's most powerful liberals			0
the events following june 30 have rendered @entity1 an inoperable landscape for the few citizens pursuing the genuine aims of liberalism			0
the isolated voices of figures such as @entity155 and @entity156 , who have spoken out against the interim government 's authoritarian tactics have been shunned by their " liberal " brethren working in concert with the military 's government			2
consider @entity155 , former interim vice president and director - general of the @entity164			0
a strong proponent of liberalism , @entity155 expressed vehement disagreement with the interim government 's plan to employ violence to crack down on @entity47 protesters on august 14			2
remaining loyal to his principles , @entity155 resigned from his position when the interim government moved forward with this decision			0
in the meantime , " liberals " backing the government harshly criticized @entity155 while his own @entity177 filed a lawsuit against him			0
on july 31 , @entity156 , a prominent political scientist , former member of parliament , and head of the @entity183 thrashed his fellow " liberals " in @entity1 's daily @entity188 for betraying their principles in support of the military			1
his article was met with strong criticism and personal attacks			0
when fabricated headlines told of a relationship with the @entity47 and the @entity194 , he responded to rumors on his @entity197 account , warning that the current regime was working to silence pro-democracy voices			2
we are now seeing a brand of liberalism in @entity1 which does little to serve its own values and principles			2
disenchanted onlookers and advocates of the goals of @entity1 's 2011 revolution look on as so - called liberals work with the military to supervise the resurgence of authoritarianism			1
an @entity1 which serves the interests of @entity216 , @entity217 , and @entity218 can not exist without a pluralistic society participating in an inclusive democracy , the principles of which struggle to survive within the minds of a powerless minority			0
@entity223 : @entity1 's growing militant threat ?			1
