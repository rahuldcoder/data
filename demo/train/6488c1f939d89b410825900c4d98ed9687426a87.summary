-- one of the stars of this summer 's @entity4 hit , " @entity3 " , @entity1 has fought his way to the top of his profession			1
he started out as a theatrical actor in @entity9 in the 1980s , later finding fame in his homeland through tv and film roles often playing noble warriors in historical dramas or enigmatic tough guys			1
his biggest challenge came away from the lights and cameras when he was diagnosed with leukemia when he was 29			2
fortunately he was able to continue acting while visiting hospital for treatment			1
however a return of the cancer five years later had an even more profound affect on him			0
" when i got relapse , i thought my life would be meaningless if i did not make a comeback as an actor			2
it was a kind of sense of duty			0
that 's how i faced [ it ] , " he told @entity0			0
" one good thing was that it gave me a time to reflect on my way of life , to think how i had connected myself to society			0
i had very vague image about the work of acting until then ... we could connect to society because there are audiences who watch our performance			2
" making a connection to a worldwide audience came with his role alongside @entity50 in 2003 film " @entity51 "			2
it also helped @entity1 expand his own horizons			0
" it was good that after growing in my career and seeing kind of a limit in myself , in a way @entity4 told me that it was not a limit at all ... it opened me up to go as far as i can , " he said			1
now 50 , @entity1 has continued to make movies in @entity9 after his @entity62 nominated performance in " @entity51 " but has maintained his @entity4 credentials with roles in @entity68 's " letters from @entity67 " and " @entity69 "			1
his global profile is also growing , but he has the new battle of avoiding being typecast			0
" as a @entity9 actor , i really want to work with a lot of actors and actresses in the world and many directors who have many different kinds of talents			1
i feel like nationally does n't matter at all			0
